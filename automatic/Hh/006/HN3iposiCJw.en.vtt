00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
accounts and so you don't have to go too

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.320 
accounts and so you don't have to go too
far<00:02:44.680> that<00:02:44.980> might<00:02:45.190> be<00:02:45.340> a<00:02:45.370> great<00:02:45.730> way<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.000> start

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
far that might be a great way to start

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.820 
far that might be a great way to start
because<00:02:46.720> you<00:02:46.840> can<00:02:47.020> use<00:02:47.200> a<00:02:47.230> tool<00:02:47.590> that's

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
because you can use a tool that's

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:50.550 
because you can use a tool that's
manageable<00:02:48.700> and<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.270> can<00:02:49.420> manage<00:02:49.600> your<00:02:49.720> your

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560

manageable and you can manage your your
accounts<00:02:50.980> at<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.160> same<00:02:51.220> time<00:02:51.550> so<00:02:52.060> you<00:02:52.120> might

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 
accounts at the same time so you might

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.550 
accounts at the same time so you might
as<00:02:52.420> well<00:02:52.570> go<00:02:52.780> ahead<00:02:52.840> and<00:02:53.080> look<00:02:53.170> at<00:02:53.290> something

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
as well go ahead and look at something

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.350 
as well go ahead and look at something
that's<00:02:53.800> attached<00:02:54.130> at<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.460> banks<00:02:54.820> okay<00:02:55.180> the

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
that's attached at the banks okay the

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.790 
that's attached at the banks okay the
speaking<00:02:55.930> of<00:02:56.050> debt<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.470> we<00:02:56.560> were<00:02:56.620> talking

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
speaking of debt that we were talking

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.800 
speaking of debt that we were talking
about<00:02:56.830> the<00:02:56.980> holiday<00:02:57.310> spending<00:02:57.810> what

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
about the holiday spending what

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.450 
about the holiday spending what
specifically<00:02:59.470> should<00:02:59.830> you<00:02:59.950> start<00:03:00.160> out<00:03:00.340> with

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:00.460 
specifically should you start out with

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:02.850 
specifically should you start out with
when<00:03:00.640> it<00:03:00.760> comes<00:03:01.000> to<00:03:01.300> attacking<00:03:02.110> credit<00:03:02.620> card

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
when it comes to attacking credit card

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.070 
when it comes to attacking credit card
debt<00:03:03.040> again<00:03:03.400> something<00:03:03.940> manageable<00:03:04.480> but<00:03:04.930> to

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
debt again something manageable but to

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:07.470 
debt again something manageable but to
really<00:03:05.320> get<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.100> debt<00:03:06.580> down<00:03:06.850> well<00:03:07.360> the<00:03:07.450> first

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
really get the debt down well the first

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.790 
really get the debt down well the first
thing<00:03:07.840> I<00:03:08.020> will<00:03:08.170> look<00:03:08.290> at<00:03:08.380> for<00:03:08.530> credit<00:03:08.770> card

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
thing I will look at for credit card

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.710 
thing I will look at for credit card
debt<00:03:09.100> that's<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.400> big<00:03:09.580> topic<00:03:09.970> obviously<00:03:10.270> now

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
debt that's a big topic obviously now

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.390 
debt that's a big topic obviously now
because<00:03:11.050> we're<00:03:11.200> coming<00:03:11.500> out<00:03:11.650> of<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.980> holiday

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
because we're coming out of the holiday

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.950 
because we're coming out of the holiday
we<00:03:12.580> probably<00:03:12.790> spent<00:03:13.180> more<00:03:13.240> than<00:03:13.480> we<00:03:13.630> need<00:03:13.660> to

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:13.960 
we probably spent more than we need to

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.690 
we probably spent more than we need to
but<00:03:14.140> it's<00:03:14.260> okay<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.860> can<00:03:14.890> get<00:03:15.130> control<00:03:15.430> of<00:03:15.460> it

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
but it's okay we can get control of it

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.400 
but it's okay we can get control of it
so<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.240> first<00:03:16.480> thing<00:03:16.570> to<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:16.990> would<00:03:17.200> be<00:03:17.260> to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
so the first thing to do would be to

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.400 
so the first thing to do would be to
look<00:03:17.950> at<00:03:18.130> the<00:03:18.250> credit<00:03:18.520> card<00:03:18.730> balances<00:03:19.690> make

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
look at the credit card balances make

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.320 
look at the credit card balances make
sure<00:03:20.440> that<00:03:21.010> you're<00:03:21.250> actually<00:03:21.400> paying<00:03:21.820> on<00:03:22.150> your

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:22.330 
sure that you're actually paying on your

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:24.570 
sure that you're actually paying on your
credit<00:03:22.540> cards<00:03:22.990> earlier<00:03:23.440> in<00:03:23.680> the<00:03:23.709> cycle<00:03:24.250> why

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
credit cards earlier in the cycle why

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.910 
credit cards earlier in the cycle why
does<00:03:24.910> matter<00:03:25.150> because<00:03:25.480> credit<00:03:26.170> card<00:03:26.350> interest

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:26.920 
does matter because credit card interest

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.880 
does matter because credit card interest
is<00:03:27.400> based<00:03:27.640> on<00:03:27.820> average<00:03:28.420> daily<00:03:28.720> balance<00:03:28.900> so<00:03:29.770> if

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
is based on average daily balance so if

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.010 
is based on average daily balance so if
we<00:03:29.920> pay<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.459> credit<00:03:30.760> car<00:03:31.000> payments<00:03:31.030> earlier

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:32.020 
we pay the credit car payments earlier

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.020 
we pay the credit car payments earlier
in<00:03:32.170> the<00:03:32.200> cycle<00:03:32.500> we're<00:03:32.740> cutting<00:03:33.070> out<00:03:33.250> a<00:03:33.550> lot<00:03:33.910> of

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
in the cycle we're cutting out a lot of

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:35.640 
in the cycle we're cutting out a lot of
that<00:03:34.150> interest<00:03:34.510> so<00:03:34.690> we<00:03:34.780> can<00:03:34.959> go<00:03:35.080> have<00:03:35.320> more<00:03:35.530> go

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
that interest so we can go have more go

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.290 
that interest so we can go have more go
to<00:03:35.709> principal<00:03:36.340> so<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> lot<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:36.940> times<00:03:37.120> we'll

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
to principal so a lot of times we'll

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.940 
to principal so a lot of times we'll
wait<00:03:37.480> until<00:03:37.630> the<00:03:37.959> due<00:03:38.110> date<00:03:38.320> and<00:03:38.590> then<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:38.770> may

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:38.950 
wait until the due date and then we may

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:40.560 
wait until the due date and then we may
pay<00:03:39.160> a<00:03:39.190> little<00:03:39.340> bit<00:03:39.459> extra<00:03:39.670> but<00:03:39.970> a<00:03:40.120> lot<00:03:40.330> of<00:03:40.360> that

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
pay a little bit extra but a lot of that

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.420 
pay a little bit extra but a lot of that
is<00:03:40.690> going<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:40.990> interest<00:03:41.410> so<00:03:41.980> we<00:03:42.130> pay<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
is going to interest so we pay it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.250 
is going to interest so we pay it
earlier<00:03:42.910> are<00:03:43.120> we<00:03:43.209> able<00:03:43.300> to<00:03:43.450> get<00:03:43.660> a<00:03:43.810> lot<00:03:44.020> of<00:03:44.050> that

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
earlier are we able to get a lot of that

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.750 
earlier are we able to get a lot of that

okay<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.640> also<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.090> say<00:03:58.330> to<00:03:58.390> maintain

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
okay and also you say to maintain

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.870 
okay and also you say to maintain
balance<00:03:59.290> is<00:03:59.470> less<00:03:59.770> than<00:03:59.950> a<00:04:00.070> third<00:04:00.430> of<00:04:00.700> the

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
balance is less than a third of the

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.970 
balance is less than a third of the
limit<00:04:01.209> or<00:04:01.360> thirty<00:04:01.660> percent<00:04:02.320> that's<00:04:02.500> huge

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
limit or thirty percent that's huge

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:05.490 
limit or thirty percent that's huge
Sarah<00:04:03.280> because<00:04:03.760> from<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.510> credit<00:04:04.870> perspective

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
Sarah because from a credit perspective

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.470 
Sarah because from a credit perspective
that's<00:04:05.800> thirty<00:04:06.190> percent<00:04:06.670> of<00:04:06.820> how<00:04:06.940> your<00:04:07.120> scores

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:07.480 
that's thirty percent of how your scores

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.630 
that's thirty percent of how your scores
calculated<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:08.770> if<00:04:08.920> you<00:04:09.040> can<00:04:09.250> manage<00:04:09.459> your

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
calculated and so if you can manage your

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:11.760 
calculated and so if you can manage your
credit<00:04:10.180> card<00:04:10.360> balances<00:04:10.870> always<00:04:11.320> keep<00:04:11.530> them

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:11.770 
credit card balances always keep them

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:13.590 
credit card balances always keep them
thirty<00:04:12.130> percent<00:04:12.550> or<00:04:12.790> third<00:04:13.090> whatever<00:04:13.480> is

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
thirty percent or third whatever is

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:15.330 
thirty percent or third whatever is
easier<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:13.989> calculate<00:04:14.170> and<00:04:14.739> keep<00:04:15.190> those

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
easier to calculate and keep those

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:17.699 
easier to calculate and keep those
balances<00:04:15.790> below<00:04:16.419> that<00:04:16.690> number<00:04:17.109> that<00:04:17.530> will

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
balances below that number that will

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.229 
balances below that number that will
help<00:04:17.950> you<00:04:18.100> get<00:04:18.340> as<00:04:18.520> much<00:04:18.700> of<00:04:18.850> that<00:04:18.880> thirty

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
help you get as much of that thirty

the one that has the lowest balance

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.560

pay<00:04:39.430> that<00:04:39.460> one<00:04:39.729> down<00:04:39.880> well<00:04:40.449> I<00:04:40.479> would<00:04:40.900> say<00:04:41.110> you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
pay that one down well I would say you

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.469 
pay that one down well I would say you
know<00:04:41.650> if<00:04:41.710> you've<00:04:41.830> got<00:04:41.889> different<00:04:42.490> balances

00:04:43.469 --> 00:04:43.479 
know if you've got different balances

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:44.760 
know if you've got different balances
start<00:04:43.780> with<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.050> ones<00:04:44.259> with<00:04:44.500> the<00:04:44.530> lower

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
start with the ones with the lower

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:47.189 
start with the ones with the lower
balances<00:04:45.449> because<00:04:46.449> you<00:04:46.539> can<00:04:46.660> knock<00:04:46.840> them<00:04:47.050> out

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
balances because you can knock them out

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.840 
balances because you can knock them out
sooner<00:04:47.650> now<00:04:47.830> they're<00:04:48.070> all<00:04:48.280> about<00:04:48.610> the<00:04:48.669> same

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850 
sooner now they're all about the same

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.550 
sooner now they're all about the same
then<00:04:49.449> of<00:04:49.539> course<00:04:49.570> we<00:04:49.960> want<00:04:50.139> to<00:04:50.229> attack<00:04:50.410> the

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
then of course we want to attack the

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.290 
then of course we want to attack the
ones<00:04:50.740> with<00:04:50.889> the<00:04:50.919> higher<00:04:51.160> interest<00:04:51.610> rates<00:04:51.820> so

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
ones with the higher interest rates so

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.760 
ones with the higher interest rates so
it<00:04:52.419> really<00:04:52.449> depends<00:04:52.990> on<00:04:53.229> the<00:04:53.530> type<00:04:53.740> of

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:53.770 
it really depends on the type of

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:55.439 
it really depends on the type of
accounts<00:04:54.400> and<00:04:54.460> what<00:04:54.639> the<00:04:54.729> balances<00:04:55.150> are<00:04:55.300> that

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:55.449 
accounts and what the balances are that

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:56.879 
accounts and what the balances are that
you<00:04:55.570> carry<00:04:55.810> if<00:04:56.259> you<00:04:56.350> can<00:04:56.500> knock<00:04:56.620> it<00:04:56.650> out

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
you carry if you can knock it out

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:58.770 
you carry if you can knock it out
earlier<00:04:57.220> pay<00:04:57.610> the<00:04:57.759> lower<00:04:57.910> balance<00:04:58.150> if<00:04:58.419> not<00:04:58.600> pay

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
earlier pay the lower balance if not pay

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.930 
earlier pay the lower balance if not pay
