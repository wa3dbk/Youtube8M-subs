another one in this area again and now

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.320 
another one in this area again and now
I'll<00:00:22.410> speed<00:00:22.740> through<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.730> whether<00:00:23.910> cannons

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:02.409 

00:01:02.409 --> 00:01:20.710 

this<00:01:03.409> block<00:01:10.090> up<00:01:11.090> to<00:01:11.420> this<00:01:11.840> block<00:01:19.030> 502<00:01:20.030> TNT<00:01:20.570> are

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:20.720 
this block up to this block 502 TNT are

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:30.090 
this block up to this block 502 TNT are
propelling<00:01:22.210> this<00:01:23.210> single<00:01:24.340> projectile<00:01:25.340> here

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:44.919 

so<00:01:31.100> we'll<00:01:31.399> fire<00:01:32.270> it<00:01:32.300> off<00:01:43.509> and<00:01:44.509> I'll<00:01:44.659> paste

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
so we'll fire it off and I'll paste

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:52.990 
so we'll fire it off and I'll paste
another<00:01:45.289> one<00:01:45.670> just<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.820> make<00:01:46.969> sure<00:01:51.820> want<00:01:52.820> to<00:01:52.880> go

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
another one just to make sure want to go

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.780 
another one just to make sure want to go
for<00:01:53.119> three

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:11.360 

All<00:01:57.750> Right<00:01:57.810> see<00:01:58.230> how<00:01:58.860> three<00:01:59.160> does<00:01:59.370> it<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.890> away

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
All Right see how three does it and away

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:25.820 
All Right see how three does it and away
we<00:02:11.400> go<00:02:23.840> ok<00:02:24.840> now<00:02:25.020> we're<00:02:25.170> approaching<00:02:25.470> the

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
we go ok now we're approaching the

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.500 
we go ok now we're approaching the
previous<00:02:26.820> record<00:02:27.270> set<00:02:27.480> by<00:02:28.910> some<00:02:29.910> other<00:02:30.060> person

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
previous record set by some other person

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.870 
previous record set by some other person
that<00:02:30.690> was<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.560> line<00:02:31.740> right<00:02:31.980> there<00:02:32.959> and<00:02:34.880> as

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
that was the line right there and as

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.090 
that was the line right there and as
you'll<00:02:36.060> see<00:02:36.300> this<00:02:36.690> breaks<00:02:37.080> the<00:02:37.470> record<00:02:37.650> by

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
you'll see this breaks the record by

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.070 
you'll see this breaks the record by
about<00:02:38.370> nearly<00:02:39.240> a<00:02:39.270> thousand<00:02:39.840> blocks<00:02:41.959> so<00:02:42.959> we

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
about nearly a thousand blocks so we

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.360 
about nearly a thousand blocks so we
should<00:02:43.290> be<00:02:43.350> getting<00:02:43.440> close<00:02:43.590> now<00:02:44.010> should<00:02:44.280> be

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
should be getting close now should be

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.210 
should be getting close now should be
able<00:02:44.430> to<00:02:44.580> see<00:02:44.730> the<00:02:44.850> explosions<00:02:45.360> very<00:02:45.570> soon<00:02:45.870> ooh

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:57.530 

a<00:02:53.220> new<00:02:54.120> record<00:02:55.610> all<00:02:56.610> right<00:02:56.700> well<00:02:56.970> we've<00:02:57.330> seen

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
a new record all right well we've seen

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.610 
a new record all right well we've seen
whether<00:02:58.280> explosions<00:02:59.280> of<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.459> hit<00:02:59.610> so<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:01.470> is

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
whether explosions of a hit so this is

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.100 
whether explosions of a hit so this is
our<00:03:01.739> latest<00:03:01.890> one<00:03:02.310> so<00:03:02.670> don't<00:03:03.390> go<00:03:03.600> into<00:03:03.720> love<00:03:03.930> it

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110

our latest one so don't go into love it
out<00:03:05.600> here<00:03:06.920> is<00:03:07.920> the<00:03:08.750> middle<00:03:09.750> of<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:10.019> so<00:03:10.200> i'm

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
out here is the middle of it so i'm

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.509 
out here is the middle of it so i'm
guessing<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.620> project<00:03:10.980> i<00:03:11.100> would<00:03:11.250> have<00:03:11.340> landed

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
guessing the project i would have landed

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:18.620 
guessing the project i would have landed
about<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:13.940> may<00:03:14.940> be<00:03:15.000> there<00:03:17.209> so<00:03:18.209> that's<00:03:18.390> that

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
about that may be there so that's that

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.330 
about that may be there so that's that
um<00:03:19.370> 4644<00:03:20.370> which<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:21.060> just<00:03:21.330> six<00:03:21.930> shy<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.530> forty

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
um 4644 which is just six shy of forty

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.250 
um 4644 which is just six shy of forty
six<00:03:23.580> hundred<00:03:23.910> range<00:03:24.120> so<00:03:26.540> the<00:03:27.540> crappiest<00:03:27.959> one

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:28.260 
six hundred range so the crappiest one

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.860 
six hundred range so the crappiest one
was

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.570 

about<00:03:32.870> here<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:35.540> just<00:03:36.170> set<00:03:36.680> a<00:03:36.710> new<00:03:36.890> record<00:03:37.040> so

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
about here but just set a new record so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.580 
about here but just set a new record so
I'm<00:03:37.790> going<00:03:37.820> with<00:03:38.150> my<00:03:38.210> further<00:03:38.570> a<00:03:38.660> shot<00:03:38.960> so<00:03:39.320> it's

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:39.590 
I'm going with my further a shot so it's

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:44.680 
I'm going with my further a shot so it's
