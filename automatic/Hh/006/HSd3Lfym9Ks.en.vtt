00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.990 
this is going to be a little different
take<00:02:28.540> the<00:02:28.720> outer<00:02:28.930> pieces<00:02:29.350> string<00:02:30.130> on<00:02:30.340> a<00:02:30.370> straw

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
take the outer pieces string on a straw

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.660 
take the outer pieces string on a straw
and<00:02:31.239> tie<00:02:32.020> the<00:02:32.080> ends<00:02:32.650> together<00:02:32.950> so<00:02:33.430> that<00:02:33.459> you

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
and tie the ends together so that you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.160 
and tie the ends together so that you
get<00:02:33.820> a<00:02:33.970> triangle<00:02:34.630> shape<00:02:34.870> with<00:02:35.230> your<00:02:35.410> straws

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.750 

repeat<00:02:41.170> this<00:02:41.320> process<00:02:41.560> until<00:02:41.950> you<00:02:42.190> get<00:02:42.459> kind

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
repeat this process until you get kind

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.660 
repeat this process until you get kind
of<00:02:42.850> a<00:02:42.970> ninja<00:02:43.239> star<00:02:43.720> shape<00:02:46.920> now<00:02:47.920> taking<00:02:48.400> more

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
of a ninja star shape now taking more

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.090 
of a ninja star shape now taking more
straws<00:02:49.090> you're<00:02:49.390> going<00:02:49.600> to<00:02:49.750> cut<00:02:49.930> more<00:02:50.260> to<00:02:50.650> two

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
straws you're going to cut more to two

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.100 
straws you're going to cut more to two
and<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.310> half<00:02:51.459> inch<00:02:51.730> pieces<00:02:52.120> depending<00:02:52.480> on<00:02:52.870> how

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
and a half inch pieces depending on how

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.320 
and a half inch pieces depending on how
big<00:02:53.320> your<00:02:53.470> pot<00:02:53.739> is<00:02:53.950> now<00:02:54.430> repeating<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.060> same

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
big your pot is now repeating the same

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.320 
big your pot is now repeating the same
process<00:02:56.140> as<00:02:56.290> we<00:02:56.530> previously<00:02:56.830> did<00:02:57.400> taking<00:02:58.120> two

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
process as we previously did taking two

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.509 
process as we previously did taking two
outer<00:02:58.600> strands<00:02:59.290> string<00:02:59.709> your<00:02:59.890> straws<00:03:00.250> on

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
outer strands string your straws on

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.000 
outer strands string your straws on
there

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.149 

and<00:03:06.010> tie<00:03:07.000> them<00:03:07.239> together<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.290> again<00:03:08.590> you<00:03:08.799> get<00:03:08.980> a

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
and tie them together so again you get a

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:16.070 
and tie them together so again you get a
triangular<00:03:10.060> shape

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.900 

again<00:03:17.080> continue<00:03:17.680> this<00:03:17.800> process<00:03:18.070> all<00:03:18.490> the<00:03:18.820> way

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
again continue this process all the way

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.640 
again continue this process all the way
around<00:03:19.060> so<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.660> get<00:03:19.960> something<00:03:20.320> that<00:03:20.500> looks

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
around so you get something that looks

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.160 
around so you get something that looks
just<00:03:21.040> like<00:03:21.520> this<00:03:24.030> now<00:03:25.030> it's<00:03:25.330> time<00:03:25.600> to<00:03:25.750> see<00:03:25.780> if

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
just like this now it's time to see if

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.110 
just like this now it's time to see if
your<00:03:26.380> pot<00:03:26.620> fits<00:03:26.950> in<00:03:27.160> it<00:03:27.460> you're<00:03:27.670> hanging
