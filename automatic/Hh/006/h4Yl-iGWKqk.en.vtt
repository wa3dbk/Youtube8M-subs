let<00:04:52.030> me<00:04:52.120> point<00:04:52.300> something<00:04:52.390> out<00:04:52.780> here<00:04:53.760> I've<00:04:54.760> got

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
let me point something out here I've got

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:56.580 
let me point something out here I've got
two<00:04:55.540> different<00:04:55.660> lengths<00:04:55.990> of<00:04:56.110> here<00:04:56.260> here<00:04:56.500> I've

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
two different lengths of here here I've

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.880 
two different lengths of here here I've
got<00:04:56.620> my<00:04:57.720> caller<00:04:58.720> ends<00:04:59.140> which<00:04:59.290> are<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.500> tapered

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
got my caller ends which are the tapered

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:01.500 
got my caller ends which are the tapered
ends<00:05:00.130> and<00:05:00.340> I've<00:05:00.490> got<00:05:00.640> these<00:05:00.790> long<00:05:01.060> ones<00:05:01.240> here

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:01.510 
ends and I've got these long ones here

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:03.300 
ends and I've got these long ones here
you<00:05:01.630> can<00:05:01.780> see<00:05:02.020> now<00:05:02.560> the<00:05:02.590> reason<00:05:02.830> I've<00:05:03.070> got

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.310 
you can see now the reason I've got

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:07.100 
you can see now the reason I've got
these<00:05:03.550> is<00:05:03.790> these<00:05:04.060> are<00:05:04.300> my<00:05:04.830> point<00:05:05.830> or<00:05:06.010> a

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
these is these are my point or a

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.940 
these is these are my point or a
reference<00:05:08.110> that<00:05:08.320> I'm<00:05:08.410> going<00:05:08.530> to<00:05:08.620> use<00:05:08.740> for

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
reference that I'm going to use for

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:10.440 
reference that I'm going to use for
trimming<00:05:09.250> this<00:05:09.520> later<00:05:09.729> on<00:05:10.000> so<00:05:10.240> these<00:05:10.390> are

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
trimming this later on so these are

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:12.840 
trimming this later on so these are
particularly<00:05:10.990> long<00:05:11.290> for<00:05:11.590> a<00:05:11.620> reason<00:05:12.040> it's

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:12.850 
particularly long for a reason it's

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:14.400 
particularly long for a reason it's
going<00:05:12.970> to<00:05:13.030> protect<00:05:13.360> that<00:05:13.419> caller<00:05:13.810> so<00:05:14.260> that<00:05:14.380> I

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
going to protect that caller so that I

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.870 
going to protect that caller so that I
don't<00:05:14.620> cut<00:05:14.800> it<00:05:14.950> off<00:05:15.100> when<00:05:15.340> I<00:05:15.370> start<00:05:15.640> trimming

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
don't cut it off when I start trimming

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.850 
don't cut it off when I start trimming
out<00:05:16.150> my<00:05:16.270> dear<00:05:16.450> here<00:05:16.660> now<00:05:17.350> the<00:05:17.410> next<00:05:17.500> thing<00:05:17.680> we

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860

out my dear here now the next thing we
need<00:05:18.010> to<00:05:18.040> do<00:05:18.220> is<00:05:18.430> we're<00:05:18.729> going<00:05:18.820> to<00:05:18.880> step<00:05:19.090> down

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
need to do is we're going to step down

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.300 
need to do is we're going to step down
onto<00:05:19.630> the<00:05:19.720> black<00:05:19.930> tube<00:05:20.200> here<00:05:20.470> we've<00:05:21.070> pretty

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
onto the black tube here we've pretty

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.530 
onto the black tube here we've pretty
much<00:05:21.400> used<00:05:21.729> up<00:05:21.880> the<00:05:22.030> orange<00:05:22.270> we're<00:05:22.360> going<00:05:22.479> to

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 
much used up the orange we're going to

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:24.210 
much used up the orange we're going to
step<00:05:22.720> down<00:05:22.870> onto<00:05:23.140> the<00:05:23.200> black<00:05:23.440> and<00:05:23.710> will

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
step down onto the black and will

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.070 
step down onto the black and will
probably<00:05:24.520> take<00:05:24.640> two<00:05:24.910> possibly<00:05:25.600> three<00:05:25.690> more

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:26.080 
probably take two possibly three more

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.670 
probably take two possibly three more
bundles<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.560> here<00:05:26.740> to<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:28.120> get<00:05:28.210> that<00:05:28.450> head<00:05:28.720> just

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
bundles of here to to get that head just

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.170 
bundles of here to to get that head just
the<00:05:29.800> way<00:05:29.890> I<00:05:29.919> want<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.280> so<00:05:30.910> again<00:05:32.970> dear<00:05:33.970> hear

both sides of pencil get rid of all that
guard<00:05:37.479> here

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:45.089 

very<00:05:42.279> very<00:05:43.080> staticy<00:05:44.080> stuff<00:05:44.319> some<00:05:44.739> guys<00:05:44.889> use<00:05:45.069> a

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:45.099 
very very staticy stuff some guys use a

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:46.799 
very very staticy stuff some guys use a
comb<00:05:45.369> to<00:05:45.519> comb<00:05:45.639> this<00:05:45.819> out<00:05:46.029> I<00:05:46.239> don't<00:05:46.419> like<00:05:46.479> using

00:05:46.799 --> 00:05:46.809 
comb to comb this out I don't like using

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.669 
comb to comb this out I don't like using
a<00:05:47.050> comb<00:05:47.759> because<00:05:48.759> it<00:05:48.879> creates<00:05:49.179> static<00:05:49.419> you<00:05:50.409> can

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:50.679 
a comb because it creates static you can

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:53.869 
a comb because it creates static you can
get<00:05:50.889> away<00:05:50.979> with<00:05:51.249> using<00:05:51.369> one<00:05:51.669> made<00:05:51.879> of<00:05:51.909> bone

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:53.879 
get away with using one made of bone

00:05:53.879 --> 00:05:56.399 
get away with using one made of bone
they<00:05:54.879> work<00:05:55.059> very<00:05:55.089> well<00:05:55.330> now<00:05:55.809> I've<00:05:56.139> switched

00:05:56.399 --> 00:05:56.409 
they work very well now I've switched

00:05:56.409 --> 00:05:58.259 
they work very well now I've switched
that<00:05:56.649> in<00:05:56.830> my<00:05:56.919> hands<00:05:57.219> and<00:05:57.399> what<00:05:58.029> I'm<00:05:58.119> going<00:05:58.149> to
