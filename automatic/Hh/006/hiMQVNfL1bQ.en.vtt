00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 good friends from youtube this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.240
 designed origami and today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.280
 make this paper airplane is an airplane 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.200
 that you plan a lot that is very easy to 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.820
 do to do it we will need a 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.370
 sheet has 4 like this that I have 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.020
 here we will start doubling the by the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.020
 half like that 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.120
 and we will open 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.490
 then we will go from this side to 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:32.480
 this one up here 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.480
 bending like this 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.650
 and we will reopen 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.200
 now we will go from this side 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:49.100
 up to the center fold 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.100
 bending like this 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:58.420
 and we have to have something like this 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.760
 when we have this we will go from this 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:02.510
 from here 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.079
 to the central fold 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.079
 A) Yes 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:12.500
 we have to stay here a kind 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:15.280
 of space a bit and with this side 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.280
 we will do the same 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.870
 and we will open 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:28.869
 now we will go from this side without arriving 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.830
 until the end to this fold of 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.820
 here 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.820
 bending like this 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.530
 this piece we do not take it we only double 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.530
 A) Yes 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.630
 and with the other side we will do the same 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.290
 and now we turn inward again 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.750
 leaving this more or less like this 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.570
 here behind we have to have this 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.330
 fold marked from before because we are going to 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.750
 this bend forward making 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.840
 this fold coincides with this folding 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.840
 A) Yes 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.120
 and we will double them 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.300
 now taking this fold the crease 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.160
 we have done nothing will go up 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.530
 the fold from before to the top 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.210
 doubling by this half of here by the 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.450
 half of this sector 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:34.450
 more or less raising this by folding like this 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.270
 and pushing up 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.420
 or if you see that we have to stay 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.420
 more or less this 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:52.070
 and once we have this we will double 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.070
 half 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.450
 A) Yes 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.540
 this would come to be the rooms now 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:02.030
 we'll go from this fold here to 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:05.410
 this one here bending the wings towards 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.410
 under folding like that 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:13.330
 with the hair below and with the other wing 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.330
 we will do the same 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.569
 or so 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.850
 Now looking from behind looking at this 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.230
 point we will fold this wing up or 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.580
 be that way reaching the point before 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:35.010
 trying to make this match with 

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:38.870
 and folding it back 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.870
 and with the other wing we will do the same 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.099
 and now to finish 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.159
 we will bend making this fold 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.170
 stay in parallel with this fold 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.910
 bending like this 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:58.160
 you see that they stay more or less in 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:00.849
 parallel then we have to do it with the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.849
 another hour too 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.720
 A) Yes 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.350
 we open we put the wings more or less 

00:04:09.609 --> 00:04:13.180
 how we like 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.030
 and we would have finished our plane 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.400
 very fast very easy and that also flies 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.780
 pretty well I know that many of you ask me to 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.610
 make flight demonstrations 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.080
 but it's that I get pretty bad at 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.970
 videos and do not quite know how to burn them 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.770
 so I 'd rather you do them 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.110
 you and that you already watch how they fly in 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.090
 your house and without more here under you 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.040
 I will leave the facebook and the twitter so that 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:36.100
 you see everything I'm uploading you can 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.600
 give like favorites to share and good 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.460
 You can also tell me everything that 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.140
 you want in the comments of the video we 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.860
 we see in other videos thanks for watching 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.860
 until another
