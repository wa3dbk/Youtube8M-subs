another<00:01:31.350> way<00:01:31.650> and<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.430> way<00:01:32.460> I<00:01:32.579> recommend<00:01:33.150> is

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:35.299 
another way and the way I recommend is

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:38.050 
another way and the way I recommend is
asking<00:01:36.299> your<00:01:36.450> buddy<00:01:36.810> list<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.290> your<00:01:37.619> guilt

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
asking your buddy list or your guilt

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.469 
asking your buddy list or your guilt
usually<00:01:39.060> if<00:01:39.869> you<00:01:39.990> go<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> couple

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
usually if you go in with a couple

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.780 
usually if you go in with a couple
people<00:01:42.479> or<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:42.990> few<00:01:43.259> people<00:01:43.619> you<00:01:43.799> can<00:01:43.979> get<00:01:44.579> into

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
people or a few people you can get into

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.940 
people or a few people you can get into
a<00:01:44.820> party<00:01:45.180> pretty<00:01:45.360> easily<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.470> a

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
a party pretty easily and you have a

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.889 
a party pretty easily and you have a
better<00:01:47.399> chance<00:01:47.490> of<00:01:47.909> keeping<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.420> together<00:01:48.570> and

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
better chance of keeping it together and

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
better chance of keeping it together and
having<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.229> not<00:01:49.409> break<00:01:49.680> up<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.070> i<00:01:50.729> think

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
having it not break up and i think

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.020 
having it not break up and i think
that's<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:52.049> best<00:01:52.170> way<00:01:52.640> another<00:01:53.640> thing<00:01:53.909> you

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
that's the best way another thing you

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990 
that's the best way another thing you
can<00:01:54.149> do<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.659> you<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.280> channel<00:01:56.280> surf<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.820> you

can do is you can channel surf and you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.670
