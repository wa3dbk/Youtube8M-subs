it<00:01:51.750> as<00:01:51.869> wallpaper<00:01:53.329> set<00:01:55.939> and<00:01:56.939> as<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.509> can<00:01:57.659> see

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
it as wallpaper set and as you can see

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.020 
it as wallpaper set and as you can see
it<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> full<00:01:58.770> black<00:01:59.219> background<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> can't

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
it is a full black background you can't

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.510 
it is a full black background you can't
even<00:02:00.149> see<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.420> white<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.140> side<00:02:01.520> unless

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
even see that white on the side unless

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.730 
even see that white on the side unless
if<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.759> scroll<00:02:03.000> all<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.240> way<00:02:03.390> over<00:02:03.479> but<00:02:04.259> um<00:02:04.500> as

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
if you scroll all the way over but um as

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.560 
if you scroll all the way over but um as
you<00:02:04.890> can<00:02:05.009> see<00:02:05.159> that<00:02:05.340> looks<00:02:05.790> pretty<00:02:06.149> good<00:02:06.329> it's

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
you can see that looks pretty good it's

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.690 
you can see that looks pretty good it's
fully<00:02:06.869> black<00:02:07.200> so<00:02:07.500> that's<00:02:07.619> gonna<00:02:08.160> save<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.489> good

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
fully black so that's gonna save a good

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.199 
fully black so that's gonna save a good
amount<00:02:08.910> of<00:02:09.060> battery<00:02:10.069> so<00:02:11.069> now<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.700> next<00:02:12.030> thing

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
amount of battery so now the next thing

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:13.760 
amount of battery so now the next thing
is<00:02:12.420> we're<00:02:12.900> just<00:02:12.930> going<00:02:13.260> to

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
is we're just going to

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.250 
is we're just going to
turn<00:02:14.370> down<00:02:14.610> the<00:02:14.850> brightness<00:02:15.000> all<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.780> way<00:02:15.900> now

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
turn down the brightness all the way now

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.100 
turn down the brightness all the way now
all<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:16.770> guys<00:02:16.950> probably<00:02:17.250> know<00:02:17.400> this<00:02:18.110> I

all of you guys probably know this I

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.550 
all of you guys probably know this I
don't<00:02:19.500> know<00:02:19.590> why<00:02:19.800> it<00:02:19.860> just<00:02:20.520> went<00:02:20.730> there<00:02:21.560> but

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
don't know why it just went there but

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.860 
don't know why it just went there but
most<00:02:22.860> of<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.130> probably<00:02:23.310> know<00:02:23.550> this<00:02:23.880> trick<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
most of you probably know this trick you

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.150 
most of you probably know this trick you
just<00:02:25.050> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> go<00:02:25.380> to<00:02:25.410> display<00:02:26.480> brightness

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
just want to go to display brightness

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.570 
just want to go to display brightness
bring<00:02:29.160> them<00:02:29.340> all<00:02:29.550> the<00:02:29.940> way<00:02:30.030> down<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:31.460> as<00:02:32.460> you

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
bring them all the way down and as you

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.510 
bring them all the way down and as you
can<00:02:32.670> see<00:02:32.850> it's<00:02:33.000> almost<00:02:33.270> black<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:34.650> obviously

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
can see it's almost black you obviously

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.680 
can see it's almost black you obviously
don't<00:02:35.610> have<00:02:35.700> to<00:02:35.880> turn<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.210> all<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.450> way<00:02:36.660> down

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
don't have to turn it all the way down

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.270 
don't have to turn it all the way down
but<00:02:37.350> just<00:02:37.590> turn<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:38.010> down<00:02:38.520> so<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.710> save<00:02:41.010> a

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
but just turn it down so you can save a

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.310 
but just turn it down so you can save a
lot<00:02:41.490> of<00:02:41.520> battery<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.180> then<00:02:42.660> where<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.080> see

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
lot of battery and then where you see

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.460 
lot of battery and then where you see
sleep<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.890> usually<00:02:44.310> put<00:02:44.490> it<00:02:44.520> on<00:02:44.730> for<00:02:45.150> 30<00:02:45.960> seconds

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
sleep I usually put it on for 30 seconds

to do with the battery all right so to
save<00:02:54.600> more<00:02:54.930> battery<00:02:55.320> where<00:02:55.560> it<00:02:55.650> says<00:02:55.800> location

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
device the Wi-Fi will be off so there

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.730 
device the Wi-Fi will be off so there
will<00:03:31.980> be<00:03:32.040> less<00:03:32.700> standby<00:03:33.380> and<00:03:34.380> that<00:03:34.590> will

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
will be less standby and that will

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.550 
will be less standby and that will
improve<00:03:35.100> your<00:03:35.190> battery<00:03:35.490> a<00:03:35.910> lot<00:03:36.570> now<00:03:37.260> if<00:03:37.410> you
