00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.419
 now we are going to attack certain 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:08.519
 us from our arpeggio by pressing more 

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:10.519
 one note at a time or the bass more 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.000
 some of the acute notes 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.009
 now to give a little more color to 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.600
 our arpeggios what we are going to do 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.610
 is 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.710
 press the bass 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.510
 and simultaneously with the low pulsar 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.700
 any of the other notes of our 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.420
 region in this case let's let be the 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.900
 first rope 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.900
 Y 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.690
 the arpeggio can be for example 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.690
 like this 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.870
 Y 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.470
 this region that sounds pretty 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.190
 interesting is not more than the first art 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.190
 what we saw 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.640
 with the sole incorporation of the first 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.670
 rope for example if I want instead of 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.090
 incorporate the first incorporated the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090
 second 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.430
 to make it clear 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.900
 could incorporate the third but as 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.940
 the sequence of the arpeggio 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:41.470
 it starts in the third I'll have a 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:41.470
 shock between drugs we can do 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:49.420
 and such 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.420
 but I do want inverse 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.900
 we had seen incorporating 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.780
 do not
