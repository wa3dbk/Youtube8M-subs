00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.320
 hello people it's strato embarrassed 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.780
 today we find ourselves on a tutorial 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.999
 movie cadets to learn how to make a 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.279
 curved text if you do not know what 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:19.109
 that it's a curved text you're going 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.330
 discover it right away so you 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.130
 open cinema case tunes to quarrel 13 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.529
 anyway I use seems to 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.349
 rusal the air 12 excuse me even though I 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.210
 the n13 so you open up younger cinema 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.650
 you do as usual our graffiti 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.240
 to the text 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.010
 you create your goal that we are going 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:39.030
 put a tutor here then we do police 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600
 we will change the font 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.280
 I like the police who is called Ali 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:47.840
 what can I download on dafont I 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.840
 very much the link in the description 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:54.980
 here you are looking for ali font by 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.870
 example or done ok then we will 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.100
 change the depth so I'm you 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.690
 often puts 80 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.940
 we will put a lid 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.880
 cover and kisses at the beginning and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.830
 lids and miso at the end way 

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.830
 then we will then do 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.340
 in our text so you select 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.100
 well your text you click on it 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.790
 commit here and relax on 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:27.010
 envelope then you slip envelope 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.160
 in the text object is then you 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:33.770
 can predict that it turns you 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.560
 put roughly in the middle so that 

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:38.750
 that the hub for example when you early be 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.500
 in the middle so here is 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.179
 then you go into objects of which you 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 click of course en bloc and you have 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.579
 in objects and ben you change everything 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.020
 just the measurements so that's it 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.810
 ample height I did not think 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.500
 too much to touch a penny the radius and the 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.530
 width in this case pop increase the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.950
 radius will contrast width and radius 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.549
 see a roughly curved text that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.660
 so dare you can see we have 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:15.760
 our text here our own added 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:17.410
 new materials and red have 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.540
 unchecked that the decree still each 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.880
 election new textures fresnel to 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:26.110
 100% 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:30.610
 red anna we can create a sky 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.980
 or white rice and by unchecking 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.850
 specular pure slides in this 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.630
 sky 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.070
 and here we have a beautiful text 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.990
 curved so this strategy n hope 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.820
 that if you liked everything there is 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.910
 will have others on cinema 4d photoshop 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.140
 after effects vegas pro premiere pro he 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.030
 will be plenty of other tutorials on his 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.070
 software I hope you enjoyed it 

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.610
 I say lille 2 and x but it's not 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.470
 serious
