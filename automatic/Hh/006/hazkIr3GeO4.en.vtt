00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:06.690
 welcome to fear ev 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.040
 like her for sure if she's the last one 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.960
 you already know we have already seen 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.570
 We're just extremely concerned with that 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.190
 smart home and at the last broadcast 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.849
 We could use a lot of switchable sockets 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.170
 imagine 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.730
 you could see how to do that 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.710
 Light on and off is everything 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.840
 nice cool but today I have something 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.279
 really cool for you as is light 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.019
 a great thing but much more interesting 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.609
 it will be if you also all the others 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.470
 property of one can control 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.179
 and here I have the four of you 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.949
 other gadgets again on the table 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.960
 asked and want you now times 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.450
 Imagine and start with one 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.879
 small temperature and humidity 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.410
 you certainly know knives you can 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.700
 what to put in whichever 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.680
 rooms control every temperature 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.090
 you also wanted to be able to do that over the 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.800
 then retrieve smartphone app 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.480
 that means you go into the smartphone app 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.750
 I think I can go in for a while 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.140
 Zack zack reaches for the temperature 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.670
 knife too and already wta in the room in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.739
 designed the temperature down to this 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.870
 it has currently the and the temperature 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.219
 and the humidity that can 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.690
 example be interesting if the times 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.549
 from her nursery from the baby 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.020
 always want to control how it is 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.250
 the temperature but how is that 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.140
 humidity and then it could be from 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.820
 anywhere if you made within eg from 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.020
 garden you can see everything then 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.540
 my baby is fine 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
 temperature is ok 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.030
 By the way, you do not have to just get up 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.110
 to limit a space you can 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.180
 any number of these 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
 buy temperature sensors and 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.680
 could be as many as you like 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.000
 then monitor the room or area 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.710
 And that was the temperature of the air 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.509
 humidity sensor and now we come 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:34.500
 something as cool as I am 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:36.030
 personally think that looks great 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.579
 a small golf beats is not 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.610
 guy golf clubs for dwarves but it 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.540
 is a plant sensor and asks 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 surely what is going on now 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.509
 plant sensor 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.759
 The principle is quite simply explained to me 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.310
 always very cool goals that I believe 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.689
 priscilla call the press there 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.619
 you are not quite as good as you see 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.560
 she already has some brown ones here 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.000
 put 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.470
 the water that seems a bit too 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.939
 I have little or too much to be 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.990
 like I said earlier 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.430
 No green thumbs at all 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.390
 could look at you and explain something here 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 is missing and what is not 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.709
 but I have to plant in it now 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.910
 sensor just plugged in so and so 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.590
 now you have to plant this whole 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.720
 are so let a few days in there 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.819
 it measures namely different he values 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 For one thing, how many degrees does that measure ? 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.900
 So plant like the temperature of the earth 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.640
 the plant is like or to the other 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.400
 wet or dry 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.290
 ver.di is on earth and can do it 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.549
 one can deduce from it what the plant 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.660
 needed or if they are 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:30.130
 even more needed because they 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.950
 maybe already too much was poured 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.980
 what happens more often and now 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.330
 Of course, the big question is where do you want to go 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.060
 he plants the knowledge of the plant 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:40.690
 needs others asks others 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.790
 prerequisites needs more but 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.819
 also less water no problem because 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:49.750
 the app has a database in it 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.099
 I believe 150 to 200 plants 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.420
 which you can choose for 

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:58.090
 have one that is a high course 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.430
 I already have them there and they can 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:03.220
 I see everything clearly the plant 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:05.799
 apparently it needs water too 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:08.200
 it is you can look so good here 

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:09.790
 when dry were namely three strokes 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.049
 from 4 and accordingly is the 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.850
 Plant too dry would make you 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.819
 seawater expect me then my 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.380
 tell friends directly and times 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:20.829
 otherwise temperature seems ok 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.660
 to be right on it the temperature 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.950
 Everything is alright 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.790
 then we will be the evening 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.470
 plant a little water so provides 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.690
 the whole time the sensor is gone 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:34.209
 a little more combo now to the next one 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.739
 gadgets that's the rain sensor 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:37.060
 you certainly all know from too 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.470
 home already there are so small tubes 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.970
 put the chamber in the gardens in there 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.720
 you can read it certainly evo 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.340
 expedient but not so 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.260
 cool as that is actually considered 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.060
 heard today and technology experts too 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.889
 I want to introduce you or I mean away 

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.000
 already like in his garden and churches 

00:03:50.889 --> 00:03:53.920
 to as you look do you prefer to be 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.970
 smartphone in an app and looks like 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.650
 I have many exactly 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.269
 precipitation this year or had the 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:00.639
 smart or that day was this hour 

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:02.319
 and that's easy, I'll tell you 

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:04.090
 the device in the garden the whole 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.430
 connects like all other gadgets 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.910
 also with the gateway and send that 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:09.190
 gateway 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:10.390
 the data to it by this rain sensor 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.660
 get to the iphone 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:15.880
 you go to the app rhine opens the 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.160
 app and look in there but today I have like that 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:20.200
 and had so much precipitation and 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.120
 could control the talk pid 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.900
 how wet or dry or garden is 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.380
 Of course you can still do that 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.120
 For example, you can use it for other purposes 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.590
 You can put his cellar on the cellar 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.120
 Put the washing machine and if you want 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.190
 washing machines we should leak 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:36.550
 or you should break then you can 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:39.180
 It's also necessary in smartphones 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.240
 I have just seen 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:44.320
 for which you have a cameraman today 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.180
 So I just wanted that 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.590
 vital process of 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.030
 lifesaving a washing machine 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.470
 explain if this 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:52.210
 Washer should leak and the 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.890
 whole cellar had been running right in 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.090
 smartphone the look if you are already around 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.380
 Do not even look in the cellar 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.940
 can all be clear 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.120
 my cellar is just not good me 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.200
 should call the fire department and that 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:03.780
 you can also use these with all of them 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.210
 manage rain sensor 

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:09.480
 and yes that was the rain sensor 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:11.770
 we come to the last gadgets and 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.790
 hearty is from the outside with distance 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.860
 coolest of all 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.080
 that's the wind speed and 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.370
 wind direction sensor and what do you do 

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.080
 with it as the name suggests you 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.660
 so must the speed and the 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.650
 wind direction and what do you need it for 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.419
 if you come to the market, for example 

00:05:23.650 --> 00:05:26.830
 more often before, for example, the airport 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:28.210
 garden then you have to go 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.390
 and again his wind direction 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.770
 but I personally need it as a technique 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.419
 definitely cool when 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.950
 I something the figurehead and always with 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.740
 everything is clear to the smartphone 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.120
 If the speed of 160 km h 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.590
 per minute i should be so slow in 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.830
 move the tornado or on the cellar 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.800
 me too but have the whole time 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:52.030
 to demonstrate clearly 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:53.700
 I think that's a good thing 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:56.770
 not so straight now but that 

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.330
 an event will be a technique 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:03.470
 I need a decent snowstorm 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:11.910
 and you away 

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:13.320
 definitely yes i also think sat once came 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.740
 suddenly you do not expect in one 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:17.600
 company but I can look very short 

00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:22.140
 at least we had 

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:24.930
 wind speeds of 68 km / h 68 

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.490
 km / h and is certainly we say that 

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.870
 Look at it on my ipad too 

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.460
 This whole app can also be found on the 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.950
 ipad play and you can also over 

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.950
 the ipad all these devices 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:36.060
 control and I try now 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.490
 First of all, I hope I could 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:40.680
 explain the whole vividly and 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.910
 still perfect to conclude that everything is 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.350
 Battery operated that means you have to 

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:45.570
 do not lift out lines or 

00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:47.220
 new children's room line can link 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:50.670
 everything with commercial double and to 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:52.170
 play batteries except use these 

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:54.120
 little friend here the need one 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:55.530
 button cell but that too should not 

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:57.030
 pose big problem because due 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:59.370
 the extremely long term would be the 

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:00.840
 many weeks do not even say sparingly 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.120
 and I say goodbye to you now 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.220
 who here from the snow? 

00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:08.240
 free and will be a lot of fun 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.240
 Have fun with the devices
