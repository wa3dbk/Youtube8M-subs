00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
race but really kind of becomes apparent

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.130 
race but really kind of becomes apparent
when<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> play<00:01:21.210> 80<00:01:21.390> minutes<00:01:21.689> so<00:01:21.869> just

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
some issues that I had to take care of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.660 
some issues that I had to take care of
but<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:25.049> terms<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.500> mental<00:01:25.920> transition<00:01:26.430> it<00:01:26.640> was

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
but in terms of mental transition it was

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.999 
but in terms of mental transition it was
pretty<00:01:27.270> it's<00:01:27.750> been<00:01:28.320> a<00:01:28.350> pretty<00:01:28.530> challenging

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
pretty it's been a pretty challenging

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.249

summer<00:01:29.270> coming<00:01:30.270> back<00:01:30.390> into<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.720> team<00:01:30.869> I<00:01:30.930> see<00:01:31.229> a

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
summer coming back into the team I see a

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.230 
summer coming back into the team I see a
difference<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> team<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.579> I'm<00:01:32.939> excited

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
difference with the team and I'm excited

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.999 
difference with the team and I'm excited
I<00:01:33.479> think<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> girls<00:01:33.960> look<00:01:34.170> great<00:01:34.290> I<00:01:34.650> think

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
I think the girls look great I think

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
I think the girls look great I think
that<00:01:35.070> we<00:01:35.369> have<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.509> know<00:01:36.630> there's<00:01:36.840> some<00:01:37.049> girls

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that we have you know there's some girls

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.660 
that we have you know there's some girls
that<00:01:37.619> are<00:01:37.770> really<00:01:37.979> going<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.130> stand<00:01:38.369> over<00:01:38.579> this

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
that are really going to stand over this

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.310 
that are really going to stand over this
world<00:01:38.850> cut<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.329> think<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.689> Canada<00:01:40.259> is

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
world cut that I think that Canada is

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
world cut that I think that Canada is
going<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> be<00:01:41.610> introduced<00:01:41.970> them<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.360> some

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
going to be introduced them to some

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
going to be introduced them to some
pretty<00:01:42.689> phenomenal<00:01:42.899> players<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.590> think<00:01:43.619> that

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
pretty phenomenal players I think that

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.950 
pretty phenomenal players I think that
for<00:01:44.549> example<00:01:44.640> kelly<00:01:45.090> russell<00:01:45.450> i<00:01:45.630> think<00:01:45.840> is

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
for example kelly russell i think is

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.450 
for example kelly russell i think is
probably<00:01:46.200> one<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.649> the<00:01:46.799> best<00:01:46.950> rugby<00:01:47.159> players

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
probably one of the best rugby players

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.179 
probably one of the best rugby players
in<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.670> world<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.530> potentially<00:01:49.710> develop

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
in the world and can potentially develop

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.429 
in the world and can potentially develop
into<00:01:50.490> being<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.240> best<00:01:51.450> rugby<00:01:51.630> player<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.170> the

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
into being the best rugby player in the
