 although at 30 casualties 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:58.090

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.490
 such as an assistance 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.420
 former mate companion was worth 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.030

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.190
 someone 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.100
 listen to someone so that he is in the 

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.139
 tunnel

00:05:34.749 --> 00:05:40.800

 and I was locked up shooting my dogs 

00:05:53.620 --> 00:06:00.870
 is worth the game which is there in the background
