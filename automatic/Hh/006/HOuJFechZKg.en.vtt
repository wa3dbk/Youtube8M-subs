00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
using it but it's still I go to bed with

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.820 
using it but it's still I go to bed with
usually<00:04:55.460> about<00:04:55.639> fifty<00:04:56.120> percent<00:04:56.479> every<00:04:57.050> night

00:04:57.820 --> 00:04:57.830 
usually about fifty percent every night

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.620 
usually about fifty percent every night
and<00:04:58.070> with<00:04:58.460> the<00:04:58.490> Nexus<00:04:58.850> 6<00:04:59.060> that's<00:04:59.180> just<00:04:59.389> not<00:04:59.600> the

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
and with the Nexus 6 that's just not the

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.000 
and with the Nexus 6 that's just not the
case<00:04:59.780> as<00:05:00.169> you<00:05:00.290> can<00:05:00.440> see<00:05:00.590> from<00:05:00.770> the<00:05:00.979> image

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
case as you can see from the image

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:03.250 
case as you can see from the image
bullet<00:05:01.430> before<00:05:01.580> it<00:05:01.970> was<00:05:02.090> two<00:05:02.660> hours<00:05:02.810> of<00:05:02.990> screen

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
bullet before it was two hours of screen

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:05.050 
bullet before it was two hours of screen
on<00:05:03.440> time<00:05:03.680> going<00:05:04.130> to<00:05:04.250> bed<00:05:04.430> with<00:05:04.460> eighteen

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
on time going to bed with eighteen

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.270 
on time going to bed with eighteen
percent<00:05:05.270> of<00:05:05.539> twenty<00:05:05.840> percent<00:05:06.139> it's<00:05:06.770> not<00:05:07.039> good

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
percent of twenty percent it's not good

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.400 
percent of twenty percent it's not good
and<00:05:07.520> I<00:05:08.090> think<00:05:08.150> one<00:05:08.600> of<00:05:08.630> the<00:05:08.750> reasons<00:05:08.900> for<00:05:09.199> that

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
and I think one of the reasons for that

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.830 
and I think one of the reasons for that
is<00:05:09.680> the<00:05:10.070> ambient<00:05:10.820> display<00:05:10.940> which<00:05:11.360> is<00:05:11.389> a<00:05:11.570> cool

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:11.840 
is the ambient display which is a cool

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.360 
is the ambient display which is a cool
feature<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:12.440> I<00:05:12.470> heard<00:05:12.800> that<00:05:12.949> it's<00:05:13.070> kind<00:05:13.100> of<00:05:13.250> a

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
feature but I heard that it's kind of a

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.279 
feature but I heard that it's kind of a
battery<00:05:13.550> killer<00:05:13.729> so<00:05:14.510> as<00:05:14.600> you<00:05:14.690> can<00:05:14.810> see<00:05:14.990> here

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:15.289 
battery killer so as you can see here

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:19.360 
battery killer so as you can see here
I'm<00:05:15.380> going<00:05:15.500> to<00:05:15.560> send<00:05:15.710> myself<00:05:15.830> a<00:05:16.100> text<00:05:16.580> and<00:05:18.370> pops
