the<00:04:35.360> original<00:04:35.780> ace<00:04:35.930> was<00:04:36.200> an<00:04:36.320> interesting

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
the original ace was an interesting

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.710 
the original ace was an interesting
vehicle<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.460> got<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.820> industry<00:04:38.180> thinking

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:38.720 
vehicle that got the industry thinking

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.600 
vehicle that got the industry thinking
most<00:04:39.650> of<00:04:39.830> us<00:04:39.919> in<00:04:40.070> the<00:04:40.160> industry<00:04:40.460> we're

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:40.610 
most of us in the industry we're

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:42.370 
most of us in the industry we're
thinking<00:04:40.940> yeah<00:04:41.419> it's<00:04:41.570> cool<00:04:41.810> but<00:04:42.080> it<00:04:42.229> could

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:42.380 
thinking yeah it's cool but it could

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:44.469 
thinking yeah it's cool but it could
definitely<00:04:42.530> use<00:04:42.830> more<00:04:43.190> power<00:04:43.490> and<00:04:43.790> more<00:04:44.210> trick

00:04:44.469 --> 00:04:44.479 
definitely use more power and more trick

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.279 
definitely use more power and more trick
parts<00:04:45.910> now<00:04:46.910> that<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.210> has<00:04:47.479> more<00:04:47.750> power<00:04:48.050> and

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:48.289 
parts now that it has more power and

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:50.710 
parts now that it has more power and
power<00:04:48.860> steering<00:04:49.220> it's<00:04:49.820> so<00:04:50.090> much<00:04:50.270> more<00:04:50.510> than

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
power steering it's so much more than

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.380 
power steering it's so much more than
just<00:04:50.770> interesting<00:04:51.770> even<00:04:52.520> for<00:04:52.669> a<00:04:52.850> big<00:04:53.150> guy<00:04:53.360> like

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:53.390 
just interesting even for a big guy like

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:56.110 
just interesting even for a big guy like
me<00:04:53.810> who's<00:04:54.200> very<00:04:54.500> much<00:04:54.740> used<00:04:55.039> to<00:04:55.190> flashy<00:04:55.550> big

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:56.120 
me who's very much used to flashy big

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.719 
me who's very much used to flashy big
horsepower<00:04:56.570> long<00:04:57.110> travel<00:04:57.620> vehicles<00:04:58.039> the<00:04:58.490> ace

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
horsepower long travel vehicles the ace

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:03.420 
horsepower long travel vehicles the ace
is<00:04:59.060> just<00:04:59.660> plain<00:04:59.930> fun

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.520 

so<00:05:04.430> the<00:05:04.580> ace<00:05:04.700> satisfies<00:05:05.419> the<00:05:05.780> more<00:05:06.110> is<00:05:06.289> more

so the ace satisfies the more is more

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.710 
so the ace satisfies the more is more

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
expression because with more power it

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.560 
expression because with more power it
