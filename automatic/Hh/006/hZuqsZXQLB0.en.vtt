 yourself a green smoothie manufacturer 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.610
 now for the seven reasons why green 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.610
 Book yourself so healthy in the first and 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.140
 very important advantage when you start 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.660
 green muse are a diet 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.250
 ideally to pick up in the morning 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:56.789
 sober stomach as a substitute for a 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.289
 Breakfast then you will notice is a 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.180
 relatively short time appetite 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.329
 disappears on unhealthy foods 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.979
 such as sugar or sweets 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.479
 or coffee will be a taste 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.700
 You will change these foods 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.979
 suddenly do not like it anymore and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.590
 turn around the other way should be that 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.720
 then let the demand for healthy 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.170
 foodstuffs such as fruits and vegetables for 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.909
 example suddenly amplified and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.159
 that helps, of course, very good 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.950
 Health wants to introduce you 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.720
 the second point is your digestion 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.759
 improves when you are used 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.220
 to hold long meetings 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:35.090
 then you will be a very fast time 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.100
 I realize that I have your digestion 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:39.820
 Improved will speed it up 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.460
 will be easier 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.710
 when you have a business to do and 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.760
 that is a big advantage there 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.860
 There are more and more people 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.660
 because really with glory well if 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.110
 that will be easier then 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.010
 the third advantage is the green one 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.350
 she must take us 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.780
 Actually, the digestive work is on 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.930
 the management work of the mix decreases us 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.619
 because he mixa mixed the cells plant 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.360
 short on the smallest level down the 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.160
 means he even breaks up the cells and 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.530
 gets nutrients out of the cells 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.080
 vital substances where else very very long for 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.530
 would have to chew or even lives the 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:21.520
 enzymes for lack of it to come and 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:23.050
 thus as before digested and the body 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.989
 suddenly there are so many 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.830
 Nutrients available that is the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.110
 advantage here before digestion 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.060
 the fourth point is fiber 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:36.820
 Music is an incredible number 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.220
 fiber such as fiber several 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.540
 Advantages of our knipsers a point 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.160
 from just once rain the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.750
 Fiber for digestion turn 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.510
 to peristalsis that is then 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.070
 starts to move what through the 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.900
 Nutrition that we usually eat 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.820
 when it's not that way anymore 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.630
 on the contrary, the dam slackened and 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.829
 but here are the fiber in it and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.630
 then comes movement again 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.970
 demanded and the other point left 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.780
 Materials can be imagined as such 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.489
 little sponge that sponge the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.440
 in addition to the toxins on and 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.019
 transport it out of the intestine 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.280
 and we, then , we will release the toxins 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:13.290
 of course also seen health 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.790
 major advantage 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.540
 point number five of the green smoothie 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.250
 The basis of our body needs a 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.220
 healthy relationship between acids and 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.510
 Basen mostly we have too much acid 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.980
 in our body that comes through the 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.030
 food we take to the 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.500
 for example, meat becomes sugar 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.989
 stifles sour in our body and one 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:37.360
 acidic environment is the basis for many 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.770
 many many diseases and by the 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.170
 good smoothie we have one 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.220
 very tasty contemporary food 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.710
 where we just plant green what a lot 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.000
 basic works in a delicious way 

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:51.000
 can take us and so again 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:57.280
 alkaline basic healthy equal world 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.520
 is yours and basel restore 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.310
 can 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.590
 the sixth point of water we drink 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:03.880
 usually too little and the water is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.070
 in the green smoothie in it and if we are 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.470
 really in the morning for breakfast 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.580
 liters of green two you drink 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.380
 our body suddenly much again 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:12.910
 Water available and we need 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.770
 we are our predecessors for the chemical 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.570
 Just what happens the body 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.330
 what he needs is to share in large parts 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.220
 out of water and unfortunately we often drink too 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.320
 little our bodies are dehydrated and 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.290
 small tip ahead can recognize that 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:28.240
 you do not drink enough when you are watering 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.780
 let's see what colors turin did he 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.580
 if it is yellow then you have too little 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.380
 drunk the ideal color the right one 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.110
 color is so champagne-colored throughout 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.930
 Do easy money then you know that you 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.150
 have drunk enough now we come 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.510
 call for the seventh and final point 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.130
 I often want the nutrients for me 

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.530
 so that our bodies really have one 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.010
 lack of nutrients we feel 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.110
 Although full, but we still have one 

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:57.460
 Lack of food for us 

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.050
 take just does not contain the 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:02.380
 Nutrients in the mold be it because they are 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.840
 work is because she was now because 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:08.410
 it was made artificially, too 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:09.970
 always and the green smoothie he gives us 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.090
 just the possibility he the 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:17.830
 food as it occurs in nature 

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:20.020
 unprocessed to take us and that 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.890
 vital substances we have vitamins 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.370
 minerals 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.810
 we have met chlorophyll one says 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:27.010
 also liquid sunlight to it is 

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.990
 super awesome healthy 

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.160
 whole books just about the 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.580
 health benefits of 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.620
 chlorophyll we have enzymes by that 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.390
 The enzymes are heated by food 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.560
 usually destroyed in but for the 

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:44.140
 digestion we need enzymes and enzymes 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.910
 are like a key to that 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.090
 digestion of food and therefore 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:53.120
 the federal is really full of 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.590
 vital substances we need and ours 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:56.480
 body can suddenly breathe again 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.550
 We realize that we are well again

 first look a bit scared off
