00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.490
 what's up 

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:10.990
 but a video here this time the vote alone shows our fans do with 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.439
 that are 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.169
 is a bourgeois mainly 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.380
 very bad taste to say that it is a prism first turn shows for you efe 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.579
 When question was turned on here. 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.330
 if you conceive the club potiguar side when he goes back 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.800
 but it's past 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.590
 what is up 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 I'm going to make a suture the doors reminds me because the sound system of the legacy button 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.860
 of the postulants 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 I'm going to take a test there some secret passages 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.590
 You'd better set a trap here. 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.590
 want this to thirst is on top of it 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 sincerity 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:02.210
 the dating sites 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.660
 up there 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.710
 awakened 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.710
 who presides 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
 We later brought it here. 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.460
 I saw symbolic 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.390
 in a video 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.420
 the young man here for you too 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 if I ask another question 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.980
 happens 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.470
 so I was sad on all sides 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.430
 but that he did not 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:36.430
 he did not pull cel chiaradÃ­a 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.490
 now has not stopped his voice in favor - said 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.310
 a good book is these here is also the squid the trappings 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.830
 What did I do 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.320
 It's even created 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.480
 but he did 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.480
 gift 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.200
 I have to arrive 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.470
 closed the amount went up to local 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.900
 if you want to go everywhere 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.900
 have button had tightened 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.400
 affiliated or ft 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.400
 to go back same thing 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.989
 explain the system here for you 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:16.509
 the circuits 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.439
 the button here 

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.069
 delegate it is divided into two parts a parent 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:24.119
 direct 

00:02:24.119 --> 00:02:27.599
 for these issues so I wanted to be faster 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.529
 and also close faster 

00:02:30.529 --> 00:02:31.450
 the try 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.860
 this he also stopped halfway here 

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:39.619
 ivey 

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:43.109
 types of sanctions to that and indeed of the cpi did 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:45.439
 which makes it slower 

00:02:45.439 --> 00:02:48.179
 and here on the other side 

00:02:48.179 --> 00:02:49.809
 already the pistons 

00:02:49.809 --> 00:02:53.059
 lemke on issues 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:55.339
 here and the button 

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:57.819
 the other button 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.819
 if you pass merkel from the back 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 are going to come back 

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:09.669
 and to finish the traveler 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.189
 showed it here 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.209
 what 

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:18.560
 the trailer of the long the 7 an excellent defense 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.959
 point 7 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.959
 but relatives at the end of the video 

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:26.639
 with the idea of â€‹â€‹20 

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:30.089
 I did this asset shows that just how it is 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.910
 down there 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.219
 Who's going to do the whole circuit? 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:37.219
 that say that 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:57.419
 several missing teams 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:04:01.039
 almost all solid positions precipitated almost all 

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:09.229

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:12.019
