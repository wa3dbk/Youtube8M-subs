00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.140
 let's make a spark plug change to 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.450
 a car with four cylinders so 

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.400
 so much would have four spark plugs then 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.160
 we have here the four spark plug wires 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.730
 all we have to do is throw 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.730
 of the cable 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.460
 we take the pipe from the spark plug and with nobody 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.440
 needles are here 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.370
 we put it 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.350
 and we try to make strength 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:33.640
 if we see that we can not because when in 

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:37.740
 this case the speed is from car we 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.740
 have changed we will never use it 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.430
 it will be a ratchet with a 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.590
 lever long enough like 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.890
 to be able to force 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:52.240
 we put the special key in this case 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.240
 there is marked to catch the spark plug 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.290
 What we do is loosen 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.850
 Y 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.229
 as I say is also a cheek has 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.880
 100,000 km so both have been 

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.210
 stayed pretty hard then 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.630
 we take out the spark plug 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:28.510
 this is the old spark plug that you see 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.980
 it's pretty shattered and this would be the 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.990
 new spark plug 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.790
 It is convenient according to the manufacturer to change them 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.600
 every 60 thousand kilometers or so 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.990
 then good 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.200
 we leave 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.220
 the old spark plug we take the new one and now 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.450
 already with the load changes would be needed 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.450
 we do not have the light and here 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.940
 we put it in its corresponding place 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.940
 apply to the right 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:08.550
 up and a lot of strength and now here 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.550
 we finish we give three taps 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:13.780
 I would stay 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.580
 we take out the key 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.740
 we put the pipe back with his 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:19.210
 corresponds place 

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:22.560
 and now once we have it here 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:22.560
 let's learn until we click 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.060
 this would be the process that would have to 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.530
 do as we have done with the spark plug 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.530
 it should be done with some contryas
