00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
than a margin trading perhaps oh they

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.960 
than a margin trading perhaps oh they
are<00:03:49.880> far<00:03:50.239> superior<00:03:50.419> because<00:03:51.069> with<00:03:52.069> margin

when you trade on margin you can lose

one<00:04:57.630> of<00:04:57.750> the<00:04:57.870> terms<00:04:58.170> that<00:04:58.320> often<00:04:59.100> comes<00:04:59.430> up<00:04:59.610> is

00:04:59.840 --> 00:04:59.850 
one of the terms that often comes up is

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.590 
one of the terms that often comes up is
the<00:05:00.060> double<00:05:00.540> edge<00:05:00.750> SWOT<00:05:01.380> for<00:05:01.770> those<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.340> us<00:05:02.880> who

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
the double edge SWOT for those of us who

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.790 
the double edge SWOT for those of us who

do not really understand investment a
vocabulary<00:05:07.800> perhaps<00:05:08.550> explain<00:05:09.000> to<00:05:09.150> us<00:05:09.240> what

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.450

that<00:05:09.480> is<00:05:09.870> excellent<00:05:10.350> a<00:05:10.560> double-edged<00:05:11.040> sword

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
that is excellent a double-edged sword

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.220 
that is excellent a double-edged sword
just<00:05:11.910> means<00:05:12.150> that<00:05:12.360> it's<00:05:12.510> going<00:05:12.690> to<00:05:12.810> cut<00:05:12.990> both

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
just means that it's going to cut both

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:17.450 
just means that it's going to cut both
ways<00:05:13.370> so<00:05:14.370> that<00:05:14.400> when<00:05:14.970> you<00:05:15.180> say<00:05:15.540> wow<00:05:16.140> a<00:05:16.500> 10%<00:05:17.280> move

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
ways so that when you say wow a 10% move

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.000 
ways so that when you say wow a 10% move
on<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:17.790> stock<00:05:18.090> can<00:05:18.600> yield<00:05:18.930> a<00:05:19.169> hundred<00:05:19.710> percent

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
loss that I may see in that trade so

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.560 
loss that I may see in that trade so
