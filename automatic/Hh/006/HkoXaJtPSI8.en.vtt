00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:16.639
 this is a regulator and a stabilizer 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.639
 of electromechanical current 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.949
 in this case it is mounted on shops 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.859
 his job is to excite 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.369
 the alternator to make it produce 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:32.850
 current and above all for how much 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:37.020
 serves because it is an alternator and without 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.050
 hesitation does not produce current turns to 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.050
 empty 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:53.180
 this is the coil the magnet that 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:55.649
 commutes by intervening on citations 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:02.149
 of the alternator by checking the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:06.589
 current within 14 14.5 volts 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:06.589
 so this is the optimal value 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:19.470
 then with a bench test we see 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:22.100
 conceal it with the years and the time here 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.100
 there is a spring 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.590
 here are the slats, and with him 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.530
 time can lose some property 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.189
 and these here since I'm not 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.700
 electronic and can still be 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.860
 to handle 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.850
 if then harden the spring and bend a 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.710
 these contacts are successful here 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 to restore there again 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.409
 the distance to get the correct size 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:02.500
 below I do not know if they are seen there 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:06.130
 between feet there is the least of more is the 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:10.509
 df at least the most that of the 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:14.290
 battery and df is the result produced 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:20.290
 from this functioning then 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:22.810
 the excitement that goes to the alternator that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.140
 depending on if the alternator is not so much 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.880
 produces more current or less current for 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.050
 monitor the operation of the 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.950
 regulator 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.810
 we only need to see two measurements two data 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.290
 then the first are the goals produced 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.810
 from the alternator and second are the times 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.310
 that come out of that and more f 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.440
 excitation of the alternator 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:50.560
 of course these controls it 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 we do without the battery pack but there 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:58.510
 confuses because the battery itself a 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:01.180
 14 times it acts as a buffer and you can't 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:04.329
 understand if the times have been stopped in 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.130
 excess from the regulator or from 

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:08.640
 battery is the time for the moment ne 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.640
 we do without 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.320
 therefore to simulate to simulate the bike 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:21.280
 let's say this is the alternator here 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:23.890
 that is the power supply but it is the same because 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.340
 that is, various alternator turns 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:30.990
 raising and lowering and this multimeter 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.360
 instead it is connected with 

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:37.420
 strokes and dino with df that excitement 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:39.490
 that a thread that goes alternator that is 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:41.920
 that's the alternator tap 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:45.160
 it tells you more or less current damage 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.150
 current and alternator based on vigilance 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:49.450
 what is he doing 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.830
 you can give a certain current is chiar 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:58.120
 it turns slowly from times to more current when 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:01.750
 it turns hard this is logical but we see a 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:04.600
 moment then the alternator is going 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.890
 that is, it is turning as if it were at a minimum 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:08.620
 so 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:10.720
 and in fact in a minimum that is senses 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.600
 pick up again from the battery because 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.419
 he is unable to give everything 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.489
 the installation of the motorcycle all the lights and 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:19.750
 also advance from the current from 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.120
 put it on the battery 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:28.510
 but anyway just after the least like it 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:32.710
 know I give you 17 12 and 8 13 see what goes up 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:35.050
 also the quotes of the alternator 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:37.390
 because it tells him this must be given 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.250
 current that I need then and i 

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:46.660
 do you want him to open all the 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:49.260
 faucet arrived at 13 13 and 1 13 and 3 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.060
 13 to 4 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:56.350
 let's go on so that they are then the turns of the 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:05:00.729
 engine to these we arrived already at 14 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:03.190
 and 3 and is saying to give all the 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:04.500
 power that can the alternator to a certain one 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.630
 point 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.190
 here it is, you hear this noise 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.790
 we are at 14.4 14 is true here not them 

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:16.270
 we have more 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.860
 here now they begin to descend 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.479
 scenes begin for themselves the engine turns 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.830
 much stronger 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:25.150
 here they increase but they still descend 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.669
 continues a scene with more than relationship 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:29.770
 with more drops it practically closes 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:32.830
 the alternator tap tells him 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:35.110
 no pd more than 14 and a half times there 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.479
 must be around 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:39.660
 ok now I lower your heart revs 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.660
 engine 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:52.289
 and here and here they go to the heart will pour yes 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:54.629
 eats 13 and broken then serious accelerates 13 and 

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:57.810
 here it starts already go here here 

00:05:54.629 --> 00:06:00.960
 they increase here they go down 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:06.389
 at some point they travel backwards 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:09.360
 to compensate and see 98 95 and here 

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:13.039
 we are on a14 and broken 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:15.330
 here I can also go up to 15 16 and the e 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:18.659
 the excitement of the alternator yes 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:22.699
 it lowers a lot and then goes back up there 

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.699
 lower the min if I go down 

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:30.710
 this is how it works and I have it 

00:06:26.009 --> 00:06:33.840
 struggled over time he had bent a little 

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:37.110
 I raised these tabs to harden 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.699
 a little spring because first at 12 times 

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.699
 can no longer charge the battery 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:44.580
 because it is as if it were limiting 

00:06:41.699 --> 00:06:49.349
 aa 12 times while it must start 

00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:51.539
 go in limited to 14.5 escorted 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:54.930
 until when reached that which it combats 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:58.590
 just from 14 to 14 and 5 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:07:00.199
 I don't know if it was clear why anyway 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:03.539
 I saw that so I tried it 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:06.949
 it works fine powerful than that 

00:07:03.539 --> 00:07:06.949
 current to sell now
