00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.450
 ok friends look at science how it was 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.430
 our picture until now ok as 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.690
 we see obviously what predominate are 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.190
 the gannets the creeks ok the flowers 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 who had already taught them the only thing 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.750
 add were the leaves ok and the stems 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.640
 in rolled point that then now 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.510
 what is I going to do we are going to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.270
 do 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.420
 the name ok and the name I'm going to put 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.910
 to the sides because as we see here 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.460
 up then I would not fit in then 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.770
 on this side I'm going to put your name on my 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 friend that is pains and on this side her 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.000
 surname that is roldán ok 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.000
 I want to teach them as 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.140
 balance this ok ok 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:54.300
 to get started 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.110
 I made a list the first one and made one 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.910
 sum ok 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.230
 I was counting small square by square 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.449
 because after asking and how do you 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
 you calculate then telling the truth the 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:03.180
 cross stitch there is no other than 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.610
 count ok 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.140
 then put how many squares 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.020
 from bottom to top those above 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.909
 down as you like ok already having 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.079
 that amount 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.079
 I already chose 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.670
 sorry 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:25.710
 the letters of the alphabet that are going to 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.150
 like to do his job his name 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.150
 well ok 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:38.700
 and first I made the list ok pains for 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.710
 count the letters and the space will be 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.570
 two little squares of station that between each 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.490
 letter because also when you make a 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.430
 not just alphabet is a matter of 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.320
 count how many letters are are seven ok 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.630
 no no nothing else is the letters that each 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.780
 letter in this case of the alphabet that I 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.240
 I chose is 14 squares 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.729
 the space between letter and letter 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:06.330
 how many squares leads ok good 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:09.330
 then I already made my list ok of both ok 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.160
 and I already have for example in this they are going to be 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.400
 the little squares of space in this three 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.010
 the letters I chose the alphabet and everything 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.709
 so that I can match the amount that I 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.830
 I am available to make you so that 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.950
 is here perfect to see which ones are going to 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.000
 be 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.550
 the alphabet that I chose chose this time 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.310
 obviously of pains that is set 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.950
 with some alcatraz is obviously like them 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.170
 I talked about what 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.010
 favorite flower is the ark back then 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.370
 obviously then why I chose is 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:47.920
 this one is after this alphabet 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.560
 because obviously it is linked with its 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.970
 letter with your favorite flower ok this 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.670
 alphabet is very appropriate 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.840
 for the size and I love this 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.550
 font typeface looks ok then goes 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.730
 to be with the gannets that ends 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.530
 teach and the other smells or pains 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.190
 then you will do with this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:18.990
 typography and for your last name I chose 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:22.790
 this typography ok I'm going to put the 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.790
 Roldan with 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.250
 with this typography will be roldán and the 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:33.200
 n 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:33.200
 is going to be with 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:40.210
 with this scheme ok and this little angel this 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.900
 I Loved, loved, loved it 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.650
 then this is going to stay here is going to say 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.070
 pains will lead with that of 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:53.290
 big with the gannets pain and 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.870
 here he will say his last name 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:58.990
 roldán equal with the same typography 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.750
 little girl that we are going to use here and the n 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:05.980
 is the one that will take the little angel 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.220
 to say is ok then leave me the fat 

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:11.740
 I say if you do not know how to approach as 

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:14.170
 silhouette and all this remember that 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:17.710
 we have the videos introduction to the point 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:20.380
 of cross as silhouette how to delineate 

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.780
 how to go telling and all this that 

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.910
 then cross stitch also already 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.090
 we have all the videos then 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:31.180
 let me read 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.220
 he embroidered what the following on the point of 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:36.820
 cross if they remember when we started 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.180
 this work because I had done my 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.180
 silhouette 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:44.830
 this we have put it to be painted 

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:48.009
 with knitted cross stitch and ribbon ok 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.259
 then what is painted is the embroidery 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.300
 the fabric is already woven 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.520
 then the cross stitch is missing 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.039
 ok then good 

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.310
 let me do that and already the siedo so that 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:01.990
 let's see the finished work as they 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.849
 had said I'm also going to touch up here 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.849
 a little of the painting of 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:12.039
 vase ok the only thing I'm going to do is 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:13.900
 touch finish as well stalks 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.669
 we see the stems that paint are the 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.199
 same as I give them continuity with the 

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:19.199
 ok ribbon 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.260
 then there goes the leaves are points of 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.070
 daisies in the name misunderstanding 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:30.290
 right now if I'm wrong or in distance yes 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:32.690
 because now look here I have the magazine 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:34.249
 is that with the names if not I'm not very 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:37.279
 good 

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:39.519
 but now we verify what is the 

00:05:37.279 --> 00:05:39.519
 problem 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.300
 this magazine had already taught them 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.810
 also in 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.660
 that's how daisy stitch is 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:56.650
 in introduction to fantasy embroidery 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:59.620
 I say of ribbon then the sheets are 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.050
 daisy stitch ok 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.660
 well that's how it is when you twist it 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.910
 So the truth is very very 

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.980
 pretty for the leaves then like 

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.080
 we see with very simple stitches this 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.150
 which is the crooked and the stitch of 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.560
 daisy look how nice what good to 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:17.350
 I like it very much, I hope that 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:19.900
 you good I'm going to get to embroider 

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.780
 cross stitch and today I see them for 

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:26.410
 let's see how it looks nice 

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:28.690
 our box that we are going to give with 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.870
 ok love so much and so good right now the 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:30.870
 I see
