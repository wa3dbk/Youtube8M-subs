00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
 Good day friends this channel 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.259
 so far without problems in this issue I will show 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.340
 you one trick that will help 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:09.719
 reinstall windows and not 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.509
 lose no bookmarks 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.790
 not any other data for this 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.890
 need to immediately pay attention to 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.539
 you had more than one section on hard 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.220
 a disk not only a disk c but also others 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.820
 sections 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:28.349
 on them we will copy 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.630
 data needed to save to 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.770
 when reinstalling when drive c is 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.910
 formatted not to lose them and since 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.570
 save bookmarks firefox google chrome 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.719
 or other browsers for this there is one 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.690
 a secret that they even know some 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:52.820
 computer repair specialists 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.820
 go to drive c find a folder here 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 users 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:03.619
 Now select the folder named 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:09.510
 user and in this list of folders 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:12.780
 find and n date this folder is hidden 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.909
 but to see it you need to put 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.939
 on the construction of the folder properties which 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:21.680
 allows you to see hidden files and folders 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.680
 for this go to the control panel 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.420
 if we are not a classic kind of display 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:33.900
 then the standard then select the left here 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:38.240
 classic view select folder properties 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.430
 and tab view 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.090
 Extra options 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:47.009
 scrolling this list to the bottom and 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.110
 item hidden files and folders should 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:53.700
 stand show hidden files and folders 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.490
 and so set up the folder properties and us 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.090
 daddy aplikaseen date 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.950
 available for viewing we go into it and 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.469
 here we see three folders local locallow and 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.539
 Romain in these folders are saved settings 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.579
 various programs including 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:18.090
 building the same browsers bookmarks 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:21.579
 add-ons and more 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.689
 so that these settings are not lost when 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.900
 rearrange windows 

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:29.290
 copy these three folders for example on 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.959
 drive d and then when you reinstall windows 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.390
 you can then copy these folders 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.670
 back 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.010
 overwrite the standard or see that 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.010
 all your settings for the internet and 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 settings also other programs 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.329
 remain unchanged so you 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.340
 do not lose and those are so valuable 

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:50.980
 data that many fear losing 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.319
 when reinstalling windows I hope that 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.609
