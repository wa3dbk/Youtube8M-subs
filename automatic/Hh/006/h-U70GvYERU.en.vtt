00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 at sports friends I think they are yours 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.670
 muscle today , it's about the vegan 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.839
 rice protein from sap plus i have 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.429
 seen this product and thought so 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.639
 okay that sounds very interesting 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.139
 on 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.880
 I have to try that in any case 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.980
 because especially with vegetable protein 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.139
 so powder at ryan vegan meiwes broer 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.090
 I personally help already 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.920
 on the one hand because many times 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.900
 so that year is worked on like that 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.490
 i'm not a fan i have soya 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260
 protein for the very last thing we did 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.150
 should or should lead our body 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.109
 that's why you should supplement 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.640
 I've been there a bit anyway 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.109
 critically set the next one is the 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.369
 taste and total on the 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.880
 That's why I'm with myself 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.649
 thought okay 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.390
 This product is very interesting to us 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.489
 analyze now only times as 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.680
 is built then I explain where 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.390
 the advantages are therefore first and foremost 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.160
 the very first admit that is included 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.450
 it breaks down protein that we take 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.739
 Of course, even if we have this 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.090
 read names here that's natural 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.489
 nothing that really astonishes us now 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.110
 So from the vegetable proteins 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.660
 Well it is rice proteins certainly 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.820
 one of the best if not even that 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.960
 best next to the hand protein that is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.670
 but not in taste 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.440
 I have to be very delicate 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.000
 say and exactly at the point was 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.949
 Of course, the whole thing is interesting 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.840
 you get it back so that a raise 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.549
 protein too tasteful only 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.590
 can almost convince even only 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 becomes almost edible and is here 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.420
 the second ingredient strongly reveals that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.220
 Cocoa powder so it contains little fat 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.020
 but of course the consistency video 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 Cocoa powder from the color is that 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.100
 cocoa powder and of course the taste 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.990
 is cocoa powder but nonetheless 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.640
 an aroma must not be missing 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.500
 so that it is really nice chocolate 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.670
 It tastes if it is then enjoyable 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.460
 Everyone has to decide for themselves 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.930
 but I think just in one point 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.119
 convinced that in any case, namely 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.100
 as far as the sweeteners are concerned here 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.530
 dispensed artificial sweeteners 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.750
 and put on stevia value so pure 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.880
 sweetened with stevia with a natural 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.860
 Sweetener one of the positive aspects 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.899
 here are no artificial sweeteners 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.360
 contain what I have to say that 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.350
 is simply my personal opinion 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.720
 This protein will taste like powder 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.740
 not with the delicious whey protein 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.780
 can keep up 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.549
 that's just my opinion on that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.770
 is my taste for it but 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.840
 compared to other vegan protein 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.579
 Powder that is a very good taste 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.930
 So that 's difficult to tell anyone 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.369
 the vegan and of course 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.110
 tastes the smears too 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.569
 says I renounce the taste of 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.040
 sausage and cheese and so on and so forth 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.379
 Of course he is also of taste 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.760
 simply cut down on the protein powder 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.450
 make it and on the function too 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.189
 limit 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.329
 and right where we are looking 

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.129
 Just look at this product 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:26.280
 built with a protein content of 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.530
 72 percent compared to other stimuli 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.290
 protein is a very good value if we 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.969
 look at how much fat is included 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.189
 3.8 grams but the fatty acids are good 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.989
 partly saturated fatty acids 

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.639
 and unsaturated but always very good 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.169
 Here we look at the composition 

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.010
 essential amino acids 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.989
 we will not look at each other 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.090
 essential or or semi-essential 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.349
 amino acids in total in any case 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.750
 a product that I can recommend to you 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.879
 Of the vegan protein powder certainly 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.439
 one of the best in the wake 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:54.090
 protein that tastes natural 

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.169
 not but I believe the claim the 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.269
 you can not ask too 

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:59.129
 Alright you think it's vegan rice 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:00.900
 protein from cactus naturally in the muscle 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:02.340
 macher shop the link to the pack I 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.090
 you under the video in the video 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.980
 description 1 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.329
 See you in the next review many 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.329
