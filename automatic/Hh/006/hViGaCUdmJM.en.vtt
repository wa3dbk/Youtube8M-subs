00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 or the mountain that vegana mind today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.120
 I bring a short video about the regime 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.820
 the red you will see is a drink with a lot 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.530
 property is also why 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.599
 call water of life to start is a 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.160
 powerful rejuvenator that's why it also 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.230
 he calls him red candle is not a drink 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.240
 made from sprouts that are 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.489
 full of life and transfer all their 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.290
 adamo properties is antioxidant and 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:28.969
 has group B vitamins is a 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.309
 fermented drink so they are already 

00:00:28.969 --> 00:00:32.570
 predigested so when we do not know and 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:34.579
 immediately we assimilate all their 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 properties and nutrients is a drink 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.940
 probiotic which means that 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.260
 contains live microorganisms that are 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:40.879
 beneficial for our flora 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.560
 intestinal so it facilitates the 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:44.240
 digestion in order has a lot of 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.010
 properties that are very long in 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.840
 list what you can find on the internet 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.430
 and today I'm going to show you how I do it 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.120
 you can use any type of seed 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.950
 wheat barley lentils seeds 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.600
 alfalfa whatever you want according to your 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.579
 I like to use a spoonful of 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.610
 lentils and he has done in a jar of 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.410
 normal glass and lentils 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.720
 previously we washed the cover of 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.700
 water we have them to rest all night 8 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.240
 hours 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 yes 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.790
 I discover with a normal gauze that is 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 porous is to serve as a colander 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.920
 and the eyes rest all night 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.539
 After 8 hours, the lentils 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.829
 will be activated this means that 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:29.750
 are ready to start 

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:31.840
 germinate then we remove the liquid 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.840
 Y 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.090
 and we leave them in a dark place to 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.799
 room temperature for the 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.210
 first days soak up extras that 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.530
 a few seconds in the morning at night 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.520
 until we see that they start already 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.969
 germinate 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.969
 ah 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.080
 we repeat this operation until the 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.790
 buds have about half a centimeter 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.000
 then we can use them for 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.000
 do what 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.820
 they're going to be another young woman we need a 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:09.020
 liter of filtered water and the finished ones 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.020
 we puncture them in the water 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.050
 we leave with a gauze too 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:19.609
 and we leave them in a dark place 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.219
 room temperature for 24 hours 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.260
 After this time we put it on and already 

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:26.180
 we will have our stir the result 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.700
 it's a cloudy-looking drink with a 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.290
 smell weird but you do not have to be able anymore and 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.489
 It smells bad is that it has broken down with 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.650
 the germinates that have left us 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.269
 we can make another liter more to red candle 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.969
 only this time instead of having them 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:39.969
 resting 48 hours we will have it only 24 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.760
 I use it for example in the shakes 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.769
 green you can also take consumption of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.560
 lemon and some sweetener and as syrup 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.969
 of agave or drink a glass before 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.680
 every meal if we have problems of 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:56.930
 digestion if you liked this video
