00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello very good to all of me in spain a 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.790
 more time with you and with nothing I come here 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.380
 to announce that as of today it begins 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:09.790
 a new series since we are about 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.450
 to finish the addition to the bottom only 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.459
 the shotguns remain for nothing I come to 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.110
 announce that I'm going to start I repeat a 

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.990
 new series that will be called for 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.580
 likes the colors forgive those if 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.340
 you want and what will you try 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:27.700
 simply now this video is going to be 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.810
 let's say the beginning is not going to try 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:35.500
 that two weapons say let's say 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.480
 for example everyone to see their m 4 m 4 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:42.339
 16 and I 'll simply give my opinion 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.710
 compare in the two weapons and once their 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.839
 one of which is more advisable for each 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.820
 map which is more advisable that 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:51.249
 depends on the control depends the aim 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.100
 which is better which is worse the caliber and 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:56.739
 everything we go to mobility let's say that a 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.179
 considerably good opinion from the 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.030
 everyone's point of view I will try not to 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.339
 do it only from my point of view 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.350
 I will try to speak on everyone's lips not in 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.390
 little on the part of almost all 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.360
 and from the opinion that I think they have 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.040
 all and because of whatever the brother 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.009
 then what is it about 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.340
 let's say that now I catch and comment m 41 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:21.549
 m 4 to 1 versus kaunert and now the 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.140
 comment that the former has will be the 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:25.390
 versus let me say let's say 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.070
 50 people each comment say 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.140
 scar Ã£ scar versus g 33 m 14 fn missing and 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.729
 so if you're going to start something and that 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.409
 comment is already simply not 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.750
 comment on that comment if you see that it is 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.970
 repeated the only thing you do is give lay 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.950
 that comment and you will help bring us more 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.420
 or what it means is that if you want 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.610
 that your comment is winning and you 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.229
 comment is already there one that has 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610
 commented the same thing as you because if you give 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.580
 light will have the opportunity to 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.460
 leave the kiss written with her but 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.770
 well it's something that I think is original 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.770
 quite final I think I can clarify 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.619
 doubts that people cause a lot 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.990
 morally annoying but good as 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.210
 I always say 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.009
 like favorites to share and I hope your 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.229
 true comments just do not 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 Repeat to give ical what they want and 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.310
 good guys as I always say 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.330
 I despair and hope that this more or less 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:19.890
 you liked it but your opinion 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.660
 nothing guys with a guys seems like a 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.940
 scratched disc nothing 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.830
 as I always say there are favorites 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.870
 share and see you in the episode 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.459
 number 1 of this series and let's see what 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.459
 such we get bye and until next time
