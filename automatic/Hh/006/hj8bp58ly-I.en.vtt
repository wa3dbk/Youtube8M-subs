00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.510 
this is the news
that<00:02:12.150> has<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.690> puffier<00:02:13.349> chaps<00:02:13.709> here<00:02:14.130> which<00:02:14.370> I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that has the puffier chaps here which I

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:15.979 
that has the puffier chaps here which I
don't<00:02:14.580> have<00:02:14.849> any<00:02:15.030> like<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.599> it's<00:02:15.780> got

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
don't have any like that and it's got

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.199 
don't have any like that and it's got
the<00:02:16.760> double-sided<00:02:19.190> tab<00:02:20.190> here<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.760> and<00:02:21.090> it's

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
the double-sided tab here that and it's

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.540 
the double-sided tab here that and it's
thicker<00:02:21.480> too<00:02:21.870> so<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.860> me<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.190> was<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> good

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
thicker too so to me that was a good

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.130 
thicker too so to me that was a good
improvement<00:02:23.849> because<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.630> think<00:02:24.690> a<00:02:24.870> lot<00:02:24.900> of

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
improvement because I think a lot of

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.830 
improvement because I think a lot of
people<00:02:25.440> were<00:02:26.430> complaining<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:27.060> this<00:02:27.480> piece

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
people were complaining that this piece

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.960 
people were complaining that this piece
when<00:02:28.590> it<00:02:28.680> was<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:28.950> one<00:02:29.160> piece<00:02:29.400> it<00:02:29.610> was<00:02:29.700> kind

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
when it was just one piece it was kind

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.880 
when it was just one piece it was kind
of<00:02:30.060> thin<00:02:30.330> and<00:02:30.660> so<00:02:30.930> when<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.380> used<00:02:31.620> it<00:02:31.739> back

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
of thin and so when if you used it back

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.620 
of thin and so when if you used it back
and<00:02:32.040> forth<00:02:32.280> it<00:02:32.520> would<00:02:32.610> like<00:02:32.790> wrinkle<00:02:33.270> or<00:02:33.420> rip

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
and forth it would like wrinkle or rip

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.350 
and forth it would like wrinkle or rip
there<00:02:33.900> so<00:02:34.200> anyways<00:02:34.640> so<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:36.030> course<00:02:36.180> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
there so anyways so of course the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.800 
there so anyways so of course the
Bichette<00:02:36.660> is<00:02:36.810> like<00:02:37.020> white<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:39.239> course<00:02:39.450> so

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
Bichette is like white of course so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.509 
Bichette is like white of course so
these<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.350> the<00:02:40.470> front<00:02:40.769> there's<00:02:41.040> nothing<00:02:41.400> on

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
these on the front there's nothing on

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.620 
these on the front there's nothing on
the<00:02:41.640> back<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.260> think<00:02:43.260> some<00:02:43.440> people<00:02:43.560> were<00:02:43.830> like

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
the back I think some people were like

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.880 
the back I think some people were like
complaining<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.930> there<00:02:46.110> was<00:02:46.260> nothing<00:02:46.800> on

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
complaining that there was nothing on

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.070 
complaining that there was nothing on
the<00:02:46.980> back<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.670> me<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.330> know<00:02:48.450> so<00:02:48.810> that<00:02:48.840> way

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
the back but to me you know so that way

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.479 
the back but to me you know so that way
if<00:02:49.200> you<00:02:49.319> wanted<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.769> wear<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:49.980> I<00:02:50.160> guess<00:02:50.310> on<00:02:50.459> that

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
if you wanted to wear it I guess on that

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.309 
if you wanted to wear it I guess on that
side<00:02:50.790> you<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.420> that's<00:02:51.959> the<00:02:52.200> upside

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
side you could but that's the upside

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:55.370 
side you could but that's the upside
downside<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:53.069> course<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:53.900> so<00:02:54.900> this<00:02:55.049> is<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
downside of course so so this is the

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.080 
downside of course so so this is the
front<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.790> one<00:02:57.180> is<00:02:57.540> made<00:02:58.230> in<00:02:58.260> France<00:02:59.060> so<00:03:00.060> I

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
front this one is made in France so I

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.740 
front this one is made in France so I
think<00:03:00.420> usually<00:03:01.380> when<00:03:01.890> they<00:03:02.610> come<00:03:02.880> out<00:03:03.060> with<00:03:03.420> a

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
think usually when they come out with a

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.130 
think usually when they come out with a
limited<00:03:04.230> edition<00:03:04.350> or<00:03:05.130> when<00:03:06.030> at<00:03:06.150> first<00:03:06.390> when<00:03:07.110> a

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
limited edition or when at first when a

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.900 
limited edition or when at first when a
purse<00:03:07.440> first<00:03:07.709> comes<00:03:08.010> out<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.489> usually<00:03:08.700> a

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
purse first comes out it's usually a

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.430 
purse first comes out it's usually a
made<00:03:09.239> in<00:03:09.360> France<00:03:09.660> if<00:03:09.900> you're<00:03:10.110> picky<00:03:10.350> about

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
made in France if you're picky about

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:13.670 
made in France if you're picky about
that<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:12.030> don't<00:03:12.540> have<00:03:12.720> to<00:03:12.900> have<00:03:13.019> made<00:03:13.230> in<00:03:13.380> France

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
that I don't have to have made in France

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.500 
that I don't have to have made in France
but<00:03:13.950> I<00:03:14.069> guess<00:03:14.220> if<00:03:14.370> I<00:03:14.459> have<00:03:14.610> a<00:03:14.640> choice<00:03:14.880> I'll<00:03:15.269> pick

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
but I guess if I have a choice I'll pick

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.810 
but I guess if I have a choice I'll pick
one<00:03:15.590> that's<00:03:16.590> made<00:03:16.859> in<00:03:17.010> France<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:17.489> usually

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
one that's made in France but usually

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.509 
one that's made in France but usually
the<00:03:17.970> limited<00:03:18.359> edition<00:03:18.750> ones<00:03:18.959> are<00:03:19.950> made<00:03:20.370> in

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
the limited edition ones are made in

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.220 
the limited edition ones are made in
France<00:03:20.549> anyway<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:21.239> this<00:03:21.630> one<00:03:21.810> was<00:03:21.930> made<00:03:22.109> in

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
France anyway so this one was made in

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.740 
France anyway so this one was made in
France<00:03:22.260> and<00:03:23.040> it's<00:03:23.549> got<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.910> like<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.570> said<00:03:24.600> the

think you can see here a little bit in
the<00:04:05.280> camera<00:04:05.609> see<00:04:05.819> this<00:04:06.000> is<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.600> is<00:04:06.780> more<00:04:06.930> of<00:04:07.049> a

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the camera see this is this is more of a
