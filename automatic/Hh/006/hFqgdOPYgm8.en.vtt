00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.550
 and hello to all dear channel subscribers 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.840
 six months today I would like you 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.200
 tell how difficult games are going on 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.560
 iphone 4s is currently in progress 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.050
 game gta sanandres is the most powerful game for 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.510
 mobile devices in general for both port 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.030
 ios platforms and platforms 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.809
 android what I would like to say about this 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:45.300
 playing on iphone 4s as seen exist 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:46.660
 some minimal tanks and also very 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.899
 sometimes 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.480
 more precisely, sometimes there are sinking fps 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:56.910
 but everything goes well in principle 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:59.440
 I was looking for everything to be cool but smooth 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.219
 everything is not there as to 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:08.080
 jerks all normal playable then 

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:11.380
 There is a play and you can, but the game is 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.280
 she eats the battery and the phone itself 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.819
 heated but as you can see you can play 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:22.660
 effects are all minimal 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:26.020
 podlagivaniya and for the device which 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:28.810
 came out two years ago to play with top 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.539
 the game but it seems to me on other platforms 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.709
 I don't think so 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:41.009
 optimized sti in my opinion 

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:43.690
 appear now personally in my opinion leader 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.349
 next game we have battle superman si 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.149
 in general, then I think you know this tanks 

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:56.229
 that go on iphone 4s just very 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:02:01.539
 okay so now can be kill 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.660
 someone broads do not fall and there is a 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.640
 like shadows so effects nothing at all 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.849
 lags everything goes smoothly and 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.910
 it's just great for a phone which 

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:15.940
 came out two years ago by the way in my 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.209
 this game is not on android and so good 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:22.599
 I do not know why but soon 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:25.510
 idea should make such a game on 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:28.020
 android while on iphone 4s everything goes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:33.840
 just perfectly remind you 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:40.600
 this game is weaker than gta sanandres 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:42.960
 Well, according to the schedule it is not bad and requires 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.940
 powerful iron while 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:51.400
 optimization is just great and in my opinion 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:55.360
 Paul doing such a cool job the, that 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:03:00.040
 a device that came out two years ago 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.000
 pulls now the best games and very 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.940
 even good 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.880
 in general, now I would like you 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.830
 say that background 4 can not buy 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.840
 just to surf the internet and 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:15.520
 play minimal games but also for 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:20.050
 to play some serious 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:22.840
 games or by rendering let's say war and in 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.030
 common for work also come off so everything 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:31.240
 I think itâ€™s great and cool so 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:34.620
 I recommend to buy iphone 4s now it 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.610
 I proved to today's video 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.590

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.590
