of mine is to do a 5k now I don't think
I'm<00:03:41.840> not<00:03:41.930> gonna<00:03:42.020> aim<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.440> run<00:03:42.709> a<00:03:42.739> 5k<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:44.180> I

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
I'm not gonna aim to run a 5k because I

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.170 
I'm not gonna aim to run a 5k because I
think<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:45.230> think<00:03:46.160> I<00:03:46.250> probably<00:03:46.489> won't<00:03:46.820> do<00:03:47.030> that

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
think I think I probably won't do that

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.040 
think I think I probably won't do that
but<00:03:47.810> my<00:03:48.050> aim<00:03:48.260> would<00:03:48.500> be<00:03:48.560> to<00:03:48.820> run<00:03:49.820> slash<00:03:50.450> John

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:51.050

slash<00:03:51.620> power<00:03:52.190> walk<00:03:52.489> a<00:03:53.170> 5k<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:55.239> I<00:03:56.239> think<00:03:57.050> that's

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
slash power walk a 5k and I think that's

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.960 
slash power walk a 5k and I think that's
a<00:03:57.290> good<00:03:57.410> place<00:03:57.620> to<00:03:57.860> start<00:03:58.130> because<00:03:58.310> a<00:03:58.610> life

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
a good place to start because a life

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.750 
a good place to start because a life
goal<00:03:59.360> of<00:03:59.570> mine<00:03:59.800> it<00:04:00.800> might<00:04:01.010> be<00:04:01.160> pie<00:04:01.430> in<00:04:01.489> the<00:04:01.670> sky

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
ridiculous like I said on the same

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.110 
ridiculous like I said on the same
amount<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:35.020> hours<00:04:35.199> in<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.560> day<00:04:35.650> but<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.880> just

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.120 
amount of hours in the day but it's just

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.790 
amount of hours in the day but it's just
people<00:04:37.539> on<00:04:37.630> around<00:04:37.900> at<00:04:38.139> that<00:04:38.229> time<00:04:38.289> are<00:04:38.680> they

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
people on around at that time are they

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.059 
people on around at that time are they
and<00:04:39.310> it's<00:04:39.490> not<00:04:39.759> good<00:04:40.449> for<00:04:40.539> you<00:04:40.660> but<00:04:41.259> so<00:04:41.500> my<00:04:41.770> aim

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:42.069 
and it's not good for you but so my aim

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:44.760 
and it's not good for you but so my aim
is<00:04:42.490> to<00:04:42.759> go<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:42.940> bed<00:04:43.180> by<00:04:43.449> 12<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:44.169> get<00:04:44.319> a<00:04:44.349> bit<00:04:44.530> pen

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
is to go to bed by 12 and get a bit pen

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.339 
is to go to bed by 12 and get a bit pen
I<00:04:44.979> think<00:04:45.190> that's<00:04:45.400> very<00:04:45.840> doable<00:04:46.919> um<00:04:48.960> so<00:04:50.759> yeah<00:04:51.759> I

00:04:52.339 --> 00:04:52.349 
I think that's very doable um so yeah I

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:57.480 
I think that's very doable um so yeah I
want<00:04:53.349> to<00:04:54.599> have<00:04:55.599> more<00:04:55.840> bad<00:04:56.080> now<00:04:56.949> I<00:04:57.009> shower

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
obviously every morning but I very

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:01.200 
obviously every morning but I very
rarely<00:04:59.770> have<00:05:00.160> a<00:05:00.340> bath<00:05:00.610> because<00:05:00.789> I<00:05:00.940> feel<00:05:01.120> like

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
rarely have a bath because I feel like

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:03.330 
rarely have a bath because I feel like
it's<00:05:01.360> too<00:05:01.539> time-consuming<00:05:01.919> but<00:05:02.919> I<00:05:02.979> want<00:05:03.280> to
