00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 Hello youtube and welcome to one 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.879
 new short video and that is what I have 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.670
 something special in the hand it is a 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.530
 tablet from asus but that should not 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.920
 be everything because we turn that around 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:18.539
 and we see it is not any 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.520
 tablet s is the new tab of 2 speak 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.100
 we have a tablet and we have one 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.990
 smartphone 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.460
 the sticky notes are just there for that 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.260
 her serial numbers and co are not 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 but we can recognize it anyway 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.300
 We'll do a tour in the back 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.520
 that is yes, I feel rubber 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.829
 moderately paid in itself if I now what 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390
 the material should say that is moderate 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.770
 nevertheless such a hard plastic and no 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.710
 rubber then the mount is silver 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.200
 for the padfone or the padfone two 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.690
 as it is called in this case and I can 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.699
 Just solve it anytime 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.430
 that is very pleasant and it works 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.559
 just go back in that fits wonderfully 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.440
 we have the speakers right here 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.409
 in the side and below we have one 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.430
 micro-usb connection of the devices then 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.830
 loads right 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.700
 that in turn on the left 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.100
 we come to louder and quieter side 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.280
 then we have the top 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.400
 On switch and on the left side 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.140
 If we have a microphone again 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.950
 her so he still films volt with the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.860
 have tablet mode or I know 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.930
 I do not see now on the front 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.369
 no speaker 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.049
 probably it will be for 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.220
 for the video conference 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.630
 Of course we also have one 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.720
 front camera a brightness sensor 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.509
 next to it and that was it 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.090
 and who thinks now you get one 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.860
 phone and a tablet 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.040
 No, because at the moment where I do that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.170
 pull the phone out the back is the 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.360
 screen dark and the tablet leaves 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.250
 Do not turn on again 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.610
 a comeback comes the challenge that 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.240
 Tablet smartphone reinzustecken and only 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.290
 then the device works 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.210
 Say we grab ours 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:10.900
 smartphone want tablet mode 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:14.090
 activate and it vibrates and we are 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:16.939
 where we were before only in a lot 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.790
 bigger you could actually say that 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:22.010
 tablet is just a big screen and 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.950
 an extra battery for that 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.239
 smartphone 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.739
 What is just short for me right now 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.810
 noticed I will show shortly r 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:32.840
 Here then also directly sees the status 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.579
 in lockscreen over padfone 73% 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:39.230
 battery power padfone station 100 percent 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:42.680
 this is the second generation spot 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.150
 phones the first generation there 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.400
 you could still even a keyboard 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.900
 dock this is not compatible here 

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.829
 and I think it is not it will 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.930
 also give none 

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:53.090
 The whole thing is there from the second 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:57.430
 december exclusively in germany 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:03:01.310
 base costs in the 32 gigabyte variant 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.209
 800 euro in the 64 gb variant of the 900 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:07.549
 euro if I consider for 800 euro 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:11.510
 I also get a nexus 4 and 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:14.180
 a nexus 10 inch tablet and from two 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:15.199
 separately operable devices from each other 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.629
 So I can talk to you how to deal with that 

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:17.829
 tablet also works with the smartphone 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.409
 to phone 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:23.750
 this is not the case here 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:26.930
 I end up being a smartphone 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.829
 then if needed here at this over 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:33.129
 can serve the big screen and 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:35.299
 at the same time still charging 

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:38.269
 I like the interesting concept a lot 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:41.090
 Well, the device makes a great impression 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.859
 so far, but I'll tell you 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.859
 more on that in the next videos
