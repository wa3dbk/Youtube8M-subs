what's going on guys is Nick here from
my<00:00:30.330> graphing<00:00:30.779> comment<00:00:31.260> today<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.500> want<00:00:31.800> to

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
my graphing comment today I want to

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.709 
my graphing comment today I want to
bring<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> quick<00:00:32.489> video<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.030> nice<00:00:33.450> little

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
bring you a quick video a nice little

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.959 
bring you a quick video a nice little
trick<00:00:34.110> actually<00:00:34.290> on<00:00:34.739> how<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> improve<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
trick actually on how to improve the

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.420 
trick actually on how to improve the
speed<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:37.050> loading<00:00:37.770> changes<00:00:38.280> so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
speed of the loading changes so

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.670 
speed of the loading changes so
basically<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.450> you're<00:00:39.600> on<00:00:39.690> cydia<00:00:40.079> and<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
basically when you're on cydia and you

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.290 
basically when you're on cydia and you
click<00:00:40.860> changes<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.790> takes<00:00:41.969> quite<00:00:42.239> a

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
click changes you know it takes quite a

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.840 
click changes you know it takes quite a
while<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.600> load<00:00:42.960> up<00:00:43.260> now<00:00:43.770> if<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.309> are<00:00:44.579> fed<00:00:44.820> up

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
while to load up now if you are fed up

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
while to load up now if you are fed up
of<00:00:45.059> waiting<00:00:45.360> for<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.660> here's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.170> nice<00:00:46.320> little

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
of waiting for that here's a nice little

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.319 
of waiting for that here's a nice little
trick<00:00:46.829> and<00:00:47.010> how<00:00:47.129> to<00:00:47.190> improve<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> speed<00:00:48.149> of

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
trick and how to improve the speed of

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.600 
trick and how to improve the speed of
that<00:00:48.690> little<00:00:49.260> spin<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:49.770> so<00:00:50.280> basically

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that little spin and will so basically

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.100 
that little spin and will so basically
i'll<00:00:50.700> just<00:00:50.850> show<00:00:50.969> you<00:00:51.000> how<00:00:51.180> slow<00:00:51.510> miners<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
i'll just show you how slow miners to

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:58.010 
i'll just show you how slow miners to
begin<00:00:52.379> with<00:00:52.559> so<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.489> just<00:00:53.640> click<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:57.020> it's

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
begin with so we just click it and it's

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.660 
begin with so we just click it and it's
still<00:00:58.230> going<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.620> you<00:00:58.770> can<00:00:58.890> see<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.160> does<00:00:59.370> take

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
still going as you can see it does take

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.459 
still going as you can see it does take
a<00:00:59.699> long<00:01:00.030> time<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> load<00:01:00.750> which<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.170> very

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
a long time to load which is very

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.810 
a long time to load which is very
annoying<00:01:01.590> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.640> to<00:01:02.730> download

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
annoying if you want to download

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.939 
annoying if you want to download
something<00:01:03.210> quick<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.379> roughly<00:01:04.860> i

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
something quick so that was roughly i

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:07.700 
something quick so that was roughly i
would<00:01:05.519> say<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.880> seven<00:01:06.810> seconds<00:01:07.470> maybe

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
would say about seven seconds maybe

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.330 
would say about seven seconds maybe
maybe<00:01:08.369> longer<00:01:08.670> I'm<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.090> sure<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:10.560> is<00:01:10.830> the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
maybe longer I'm not sure so that is the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.399 
maybe longer I'm not sure so that is the
speed<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.790> mine<00:01:12.000> now<00:01:12.299> basically<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:12.900> trick<00:01:13.170> is

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
speed of mine now basically the trick is

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.230 
speed of mine now basically the trick is
if<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.159> want<00:01:14.310> to<00:01:14.369> improve<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:14.909> you<00:01:15.030> click

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
if you want to improve it is you click

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.840 
if you want to improve it is you click
sections<00:01:15.810> down<00:01:16.080> here<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.500> bottom<00:01:16.770> tab<00:01:17.070> you

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
sections down here in the bottom tab you

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
sections down here in the bottom tab you
then<00:01:18.060> go<00:01:18.240> at<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> top<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.840> hand<00:01:18.960> corner<00:01:19.110> and

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
then go at the top right hand corner and

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
then go at the top right hand corner and
click<00:01:19.590> Edit<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.400> as<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:21.509> you<00:01:21.840> can

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
click Edit and as you can see you can

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.440 
click Edit and as you can see you can
now<00:01:22.200> disabled<00:01:23.159> anything<00:01:23.640> you<00:01:23.790> don't<00:01:24.000> want<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
now disabled anything you don't want to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.200 
now disabled anything you don't want to
show<00:01:24.659> up<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.990> cydia<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.100> main<00:01:26.549> one<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
show up in cydia now the main one to

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.999 
show up in cydia now the main one to
improve<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.720> speed<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> theme<00:01:28.470> so<00:01:28.710> anything

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
improve the speed is theme so anything

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.830 
improve the speed is theme so anything
to<00:01:29.070> do<00:01:29.189> with<00:01:29.310> themes<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:30.210> want<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.450> turn<00:01:30.630> off

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
to do with themes you want to turn off

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.179 
to do with themes you want to turn off
now<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.439> course<00:01:31.619> if<00:01:31.860> you're<00:01:31.950> one<00:01:32.159> that

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
now of course if you're one that

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:33.770 
now of course if you're one that
downloads<00:01:32.759> a<00:01:32.850> lot<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> themes<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.570> obviously

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
downloads a lot of themes and obviously

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
downloads a lot of themes and obviously
you're<00:01:33.900> not<00:01:34.049> going<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.229> want<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.409> do<00:01:34.590> this<00:01:34.799> but

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
you're not going to want to do this but

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.090 
you're not going to want to do this but
if<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.479> download<00:01:36.720> themes<00:01:37.110> a<00:01:37.320> lot<00:01:37.500> just

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
if you don't download themes a lot just

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
if you don't download themes a lot just
happy<00:01:38.520> with<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> ones<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:38.939> have<00:01:39.180> or<00:01:39.420> you

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
happy with the ones you have or you

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.539 
happy with the ones you have or you
download<00:01:40.350> them<00:01:40.560> on<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.770> internet<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> then

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
download them on the internet and then

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.149 
download them on the internet and then
ssh<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.570> then<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.470> of<00:01:43.619> course<00:01:43.649> just

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
ssh them in then you can of course just

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.580 
ssh them in then you can of course just
disable<00:01:44.759> them<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.270> cydia<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:46.259> that's<00:01:46.409> what<00:01:46.530> i'm

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
disable them on cydia so that's what i'm

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.990 
disable them on cydia so that's what i'm
going<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.740> do<00:01:46.860> just<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.250> show<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.700> speeds

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
going to do just to show you the speeds

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.100 
going to do just to show you the speeds
and<00:01:48.240> a<00:01:48.299> disabled<00:01:48.810> all<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.020> thin<00:01:49.409> ones<00:01:51.110> it's

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
and a disabled all the thin ones it's

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.770 
and a disabled all the thin ones it's
quite<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.009> you<00:01:53.070> can<00:01:53.220> naturally<00:01:53.780> pretty

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
quite a lot so you can naturally pretty

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.260 
quite a lot so you can naturally pretty
much<00:01:55.020> see<00:01:55.829> that<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.520> themes<00:01:56.820> is<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.210> to

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
much see that the themes is going to

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.870 
much see that the themes is going to
take<00:01:57.420> up<00:01:57.570> a<00:01:57.750> lot<00:01:58.079> when<00:01:58.640> loading<00:01:59.640> all<00:01:59.759> the

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
take up a lot when loading all the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.319 
take up a lot when loading all the
changes<00:02:01.670> just<00:02:02.670> turn<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.360> these<00:02:03.659> off<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:05.329> of

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
changes just turn all these off and of

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
changes just turn all these off and of
course<00:02:06.390> you<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.930> turn<00:02:07.200> off<00:02:07.409> any<00:02:07.649> other<00:02:08.369> ones

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
course you can turn off any other ones
