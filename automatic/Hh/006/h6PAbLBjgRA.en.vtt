00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
through he leaves no stone unturned I

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.850 
through he leaves no stone unturned I
told<00:03:38.510> him<00:03:38.600> when<00:03:38.750> I<00:03:38.780> got<00:03:39.020> here<00:03:39.230> assume<00:03:39.590> that<00:03:39.770> I

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
told him when I got here assume that I

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.690 
told him when I got here assume that I
know<00:03:39.920> nothing<00:03:40.100> and<00:03:40.910> you<00:03:41.150> know

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
know nothing and you know

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:44.790 
know nothing and you know
it<00:03:43.120> could<00:03:43.330> be<00:03:43.450> true<00:03:43.629> could<00:03:44.050> be<00:03:44.170> natural<00:03:44.770> but

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:44.800 
it could be true could be natural but

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.710 
it could be true could be natural but
that's<00:03:45.520> why<00:03:45.640> I<00:03:45.700> wanted<00:03:45.970> him<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.120> assume<00:03:46.480> and

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
that's why I wanted him to assume and

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.420 
that's why I wanted him to assume and
that's<00:03:46.840> what<00:03:46.989> he's<00:03:47.080> done<00:03:47.290> and<00:03:47.560> he's

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
that's what he's done and he's

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.080 
that's what he's done and he's
I<00:03:49.409> don't<00:03:50.409> meet<00:03:50.590> with<00:03:50.680> them<00:03:50.799> extra<00:03:51.159> suddenly

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
I don't meet with them extra suddenly

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:53.390

bad<00:03:52.239> so<00:03:52.390> I'm<00:03:52.480> just<00:03:52.599> trying<00:03:52.780> to<00:03:52.840> get<00:03:52.959> this<00:03:53.049> stuff

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
bad so I'm just trying to get this stuff

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.610 
bad so I'm just trying to get this stuff
taken<00:03:54.400> care<00:03:54.430> of<00:03:54.640> while<00:03:55.599> it's<00:03:55.810> still<00:03:56.019> practice

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:56.620 
taken care of while it's still practice

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.020 
taken care of while it's still practice
