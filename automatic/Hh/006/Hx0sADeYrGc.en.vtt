00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:05.899
 this is the fifth video of the course for 

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:08.059
 learn to use rpn in this video 

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.969
 to learn about how to provide the 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.429
 parameters to commands or functions 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.970
 as always we will do of the two 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:20.030
 ways first in algebraic mode then 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:22.700
 in cpn mode side by side so that 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.470
 you see the differences and then so 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.870
 can learn how a system works 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.940
 versus the other when we are talking 

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:31.190
 to provide parameters the first thing that does not 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.610
 does is provide the parameters and then 

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:37.010
 then invoke the function or command in 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:40.370
 this case we will work with this 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.060
 equation and this solution and using the 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.670
 soft function let's check if that is 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.920
 or not a solution of this equation in 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:52.310
 this function this refers to the 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.920
 equation that is and var equal to value 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.250
 refers to this value in that same 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.739
 form the variable equal to the number that 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:02.070
 wants to replace if it were not to be mode 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.440
 algebraic 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.420
 this would be the form first invoked the 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:09.600
 function and then within those 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.690
 parentheses in this same order would say the 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.330
 equation and the value that I want to substitute 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.150
 in this way x equal to the value that can 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:20.700
 being numeric can be symbolic if 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.890
 out in fp n I have to provide first 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.869
 the parameters in the same order in which 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.509
 appear in the function first the 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.470
 equation then the value that I desire 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.660
 substitute and then at the end I invoke the 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.790
 command or the function that in this case is 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.010
 the soft 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.840
 let's do it now in both ways 

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:41.840
 first in algebraic mode 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.830
 in algebraic mode we are going to do it 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.680
 in this calculator and then in the mode 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.210
 in egb to the left before that 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.790
 verify that you have the same 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.790
 configuration you're going to mod 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.170
 after two calculators then cat 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.940
 and there are configured the flags that 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.210
 we are going to use so if you have them as 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:12.740
 are here then we can continue in the 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:14.750
 case of the Hebrew manners the command 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.610
 is found in the algebra menu as well 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.550
 that would be tegra pointing to the right 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.420
 and the 4 key to access this menu of 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.300
 algebra and the command number 8 

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:30.349
 inside the equation goes first that in 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.180
 this case is x square plus 6 sevenths x 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:35.000
 + 949 and now I can provide here 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:37.459
 directly or I can from here invoke 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.750
 also the algebraic editor so 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:45.790
 here it would be x square 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:48.080
 + 6 seventh 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.740
 by x 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.080
 + 9 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:56.890
 49 years old when he pressed between notes that 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.860
 returns you back here to the function and 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.560
 then eat and what I want to replace 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:12.280
 which is x equal to minus 3 sevenths would be 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.740
 plus minus 3 between 7 enter and here what 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.860
 the soft as command is simply that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:20.590
 it replaces it solves us if I want 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:23.320
 solve this one way is by squeezing the 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.080
 key that points to the right and then 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.140
 enter to convert this into a value and 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.510
 gives me 0 what it means that that is 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.790
 the solution on the other hand in the mode of 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.250
 cpn there are multiple ways that I 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:38.830
 I can do this one is to access also 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.660
 the algebraic editor from here but I 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.940
 I'll do directly mode 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.970
 cpn so that at once you go 

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.390
 practicing the first thing would be the equation 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:04:00.050
 which is x square so 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:04:00.050
 x space 2 x + 6 sevenths x would be x 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.790
 7 when you press the division sign 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.360
 the operation is performed between 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.970
 last two would be 3 6 7 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.300
 and now when he pressed pool then 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:16.849
 multiply by the x and the third term 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.370
 what would be 9 

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:22.010
 49 to you 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.030
 and now the sum sign twice for 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:29.030
 add those three expressions next 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.130
 is then to provide the variable equal to 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.370
 value that I want to replace in this case 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.440
 I'm going to replace minus three sevenths 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:42.680
 wherever there is an X, so 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:47.330
 enter x enter 3 space 7 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:49.699
 between minus to apply the negative and 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:52.639
 then now the sign of the same would be 

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:54.650
 key that points to the right and the key 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:58.610
 w to caress the 'equal' symbol and 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:05:01.520
 then now I invoke the command would be 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.169
 key pointing to the right key 4 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:07.070
 to access the algebraic menu or the 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:10.460
 option 8 enter here did the substitution 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.460
 one way to then solve this is 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.949
 pressing the bar key and there's the 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:18.320
 result that is zero so 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.690
 basically that's how it's done in the 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:22.970
 cpn mode every time I have to 

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:25.280
 invoke some function or command 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.550
 that you need parameters first the 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:31.400
 parameters and at the end the command 

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:33.290
 for now that's all if you have doubts or 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.010
 comments use the section of 

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:36.440
 comments 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:39.140
 to communicate with us if you do not 

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:41.060
 you have subscribed to the channel subscribe to 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.910
 that you then receive notification 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.440
 automatically every time we upload a 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:47.440
 new video see you later
