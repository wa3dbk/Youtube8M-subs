00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.210 
okay creating a text morph in blender

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.170 
okay creating a text morph in blender
2.5<00:00:03.990> and<00:00:04.350> this<00:00:05.130> will<00:00:05.310> show<00:00:05.580> you<00:00:05.640> some<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.029> the

2.5 and this will show you some of the
cool<00:00:06.210> new<00:00:06.569> features<00:00:07.170> that<00:00:08.010> in<00:00:08.550> 2.5<00:00:09.150> that

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
cool new features that in 2.5 that

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:11.120 
cool new features that in 2.5 that
really<00:00:09.690> needed<00:00:09.960> to<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.200> implemented<00:00:10.800> to<00:00:10.920> bring

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
really needed to be implemented to bring

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.580 
really needed to be implemented to bring
it<00:00:11.250> up<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:12.080> standard<00:00:13.080> with<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.440> other

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
it up to standard with the other

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.529 
it up to standard with the other
high-end<00:00:14.429> 3d<00:00:15.650> programs<00:00:16.650> around<00:00:17.000> so<00:00:18.000> what

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
high-end 3d programs around so what

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.179 
high-end 3d programs around so what
we'll<00:00:18.690> do<00:00:18.869> is<00:00:19.050> shift<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:20.100> add<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:21.840> text<00:00:22.410> it's

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
we'll do is shift a add some text it's

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.089 
we'll do is shift a add some text it's
seven<00:00:23.550> on<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.760> number<00:00:24.060> pad<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.720> then<00:00:25.230> tab<00:00:25.710> and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
seven on the number pad and then tab and

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.560 
seven on the number pad and then tab and
then<00:00:27.029> we'll<00:00:27.210> delete<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.170> type<00:00:28.529> in<00:00:28.769> morph

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
then we'll delete this and type in morph

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:37.389 
then we'll delete this and type in morph
mo<00:00:30.570> our<00:00:31.340> pH<00:00:32.340> and<00:00:34.280> then<00:00:35.329> bring<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.450> up<00:00:36.570> in<00:00:36.719> size

is the real cool thing with this the new

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.520 
is the real cool thing with this the new
feature<00:01:46.950> in<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:48.860> blender<00:01:49.860> if<00:01:50.180> we<00:01:51.180> go<00:01:52.020> down<00:01:52.049> to

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
feature in in blender if we go down to

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:00.030 
feature in in blender if we go down to
our<00:01:52.560> timeline<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:54.020> we'll<00:01:55.020> go<00:01:55.170> right<00:01:55.590> to<00:01:57.290> 0

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
our timeline and we'll go right to 0

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.180 
our timeline and we'll go right to 0
okay<00:02:00.970> actually<00:02:01.450> we'll<00:02:01.870> put<00:02:02.110> it<00:02:02.230> on<00:02:02.320> 20<00:02:02.830> because

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
okay actually we'll put it on 20 because

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:08.389 
okay actually we'll put it on 20 because
we<00:02:03.580> want<00:02:03.820> to<00:02:04.470> finish<00:02:05.470> on<00:02:05.890> this<00:02:06.490> frame<00:02:06.820> here<00:02:07.120> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
we want to finish on this frame here so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.240 
we want to finish on this frame here so
what<00:02:09.399> we<00:02:09.550> shall<00:02:09.790> do<00:02:10.060> is<00:02:10.360> put<00:02:10.780> the<00:02:11.050> cursor<00:02:12.040> over

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
what we shall do is put the cursor over

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.000 
what we shall do is put the cursor over
the<00:02:13.470> width<00:02:14.470> here<00:02:15.510> hit<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.660> i<00:02:16.690> key<00:02:17.230> turns

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
the width here hit the i key turns

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.850 
the width here hit the i key turns
yellow<00:02:18.280> and<00:02:18.700> while<00:02:19.570> our<00:02:19.600> automatic<00:02:20.440> key

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
yellow and while our automatic key

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.820 
yellow and while our automatic key

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
framing of any of these parameters isn't

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.820 
framing of any of these parameters isn't
that<00:02:24.070> fantastic<00:02:25.260> previously<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.440> couldn't

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
that fantastic previously you couldn't

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.920 
that fantastic previously you couldn't
do<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.040> and<00:02:27.550> it's<00:02:27.700> just<00:02:28.060> it's<00:02:28.240> a<00:02:28.390> real<00:02:28.660> boon

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
now ok and then with what we'll do is

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.130 
now ok and then with what we'll do is
we'll<00:02:32.920> really<00:02:33.730> sort<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.360> Mont<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.080> think

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
we'll really sort of Mont it I think

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.250 
we'll really sort of Mont it I think
we'll<00:02:35.380> go<00:02:35.560> back<00:02:35.800> the<00:02:35.950> other<00:02:35.980> way<00:02:37.050> like<00:02:38.050> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
we'll go back the other way like so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.440 
we'll go back the other way like so
something<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.290> that<00:02:41.440> should<00:02:41.980> be<00:02:42.040> fine<00:02:42.450> hold

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
something like that should be fine hold

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.240 
something like that should be fine hold

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
the i key turns yellow and I will play

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.290 
the i key turns yellow and I will play
it<00:02:51.690> we've<00:02:52.690> got<00:02:52.900> this<00:02:52.989> really<00:02:53.350> interesting

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300

it we've got this really interesting
morph<00:02:55.300> situation<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:57.480> obviously<00:02:58.480> you<00:02:58.720> can

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
morph situation and obviously you can

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.400 
morph situation and obviously you can
keyframe<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.610> extrusion<00:03:01.570> or<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.900> depth<00:03:02.140> of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
keyframe the extrusion or the depth of

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.160 
keyframe the extrusion or the depth of
the<00:03:02.530> resolution<00:03:03.250> or<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:04.269> character<00:03:04.810> spacing

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
the resolution or the character spacing

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.580 
the resolution or the character spacing
so<00:03:08.040> have<00:03:09.040> fun<00:03:09.100> with<00:03:09.310> it
