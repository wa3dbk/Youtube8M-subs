00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
what's called a 28 on the back I'd

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.560 
what's called a 28 on the back I'd
recommend<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.170> 30<00:00:16.470> or<00:00:16.590> a<00:00:16.800> 32<00:00:17.310> if<00:00:18.090> you<00:00:18.270> live<00:00:18.420> in<00:00:18.510> a

doesn't matter but if you do hills and

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.390 
doesn't matter but if you do hills and
you<00:00:28.109> want<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.320> spin<00:00:28.680> you<00:00:29.010> want<00:00:29.070> to<00:00:29.189> have<00:00:29.279> you

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
you want to spin you want to have you

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.970 
you want to spin you want to have you
you<00:00:29.699> paddle<00:00:30.090> revolutions<00:00:30.750> over<00:00:31.019> 80

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
you paddle revolutions over 80

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.310 
you paddle revolutions over 80
so<00:00:32.550> that<00:00:32.640> means<00:00:32.850> 80<00:00:33.420> revolutions<00:00:34.020> per<00:00:34.079> minute

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
so that means 80 revolutions per minute

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.729 
so that means 80 revolutions per minute
so<00:00:34.710> 80<00:00:34.950> rpm<00:00:35.460> plus<00:00:35.910> between<00:00:36.360> 80<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.630> 100<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.469> any

so 80 rpm plus between 80 and 100 up any

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.650 
so 80 rpm plus between 80 and 100 up any
climb<00:00:38.070> means<00:00:39.059> your<00:00:39.180> body's<00:00:39.390> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.540> work

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
have to us about efficiency on the front

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.789 
have to us about efficiency on the front
chainring<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.229> called<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.439> chain<00:01:04.680> ring

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
chainring this is called the chain ring

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.200 
chainring this is called the chain ring
that's<00:01:04.979> called<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.189> crank<00:01:05.460> set<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:05.970> crank

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that's called the crank set the crank

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.539 
that's called the crank set the crank
arm<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.750> chain<00:01:07.020> rings<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.100> rings<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
arm the chain rings so these rings and

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.070 
arm the chain rings so these rings and
they<00:01:08.610> wear<00:01:08.850> out<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.119> can<00:01:09.240> replace<00:01:09.659> um<00:01:09.869> sister

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
they wear out you can replace um sister

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.950 
they wear out you can replace um sister
chain<00:01:10.500> ring<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.740> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.580> a<00:01:11.610> 50<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:12.479> it's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> 50

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
chain ring and this is a 50 so it's a 50

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.420 
chain ring and this is a 50 so it's a 50
teeth<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.619> if<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.770> count<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.070> teeth<00:01:14.220> that's

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
teeth so if you count the teeth that's

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.460 
teeth so if you count the teeth that's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
you want to get fitter I'd recommend

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.240 
you want to get fitter I'd recommend
getting<00:02:13.170> a<00:02:13.230> power<00:02:13.409> meter<00:02:13.650> it's<00:02:14.040> going<00:02:14.189> to

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
getting a power meter it's going to

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.009 
getting a power meter it's going to
change<00:02:14.489> the<00:02:14.640> game<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.269> might<00:02:15.719> take<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.959> few

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
change the game for you might take a few

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:17.869 
change the game for you might take a few
tries<00:02:16.260> get<00:02:16.560> used<00:02:16.709> to<00:02:16.920> how<00:02:17.219> to<00:02:17.280> use<00:02:17.489> it<00:02:17.670> but<00:02:17.760> it's

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
tries get used to how to use it but it's

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:19.910
