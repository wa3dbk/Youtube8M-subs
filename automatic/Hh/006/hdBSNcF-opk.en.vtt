00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:21.539 
actually quite a bit smaller than some

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:23.179

of<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.810> other<00:01:22.110> pants<00:01:22.560> so<00:01:22.679> it<00:01:22.830> should<00:01:23.009> be<00:01:23.159> a

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
of the other pants so it should be a

of the other pants so it should be a
low-profile<00:01:24.030> fitting<00:01:24.360> pad<00:01:24.710> so<00:01:25.710> one<00:01:25.860> of<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
low-profile fitting pad so one of the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.940 
low-profile fitting pad so one of the
coolest<00:01:26.280> things<00:01:26.520> about<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:27.090> pad<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:28.110> it

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
coolest things about this pad is that it

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.770 
coolest things about this pad is that it
moves<00:01:29.310> differently<00:01:29.789> than<00:01:30.420> any<00:01:30.659> other

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
moves differently than any other

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.559 
moves differently than any other
shoulder<00:01:31.619> pad<00:01:31.799> that's<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.190> the<00:01:32.399> market<00:01:32.729> so

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
shoulder pad that's on the market so

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:36.289 
shoulder pad that's on the market so
salt<00:01:34.110> pads<00:01:34.350> right<00:01:34.590> now<00:01:34.830> they<00:01:35.159> usually<00:01:35.549> adjust

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
salt pads right now they usually adjust

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.999 
salt pads right now they usually adjust
in<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.770> chest<00:01:38.069> plate<00:01:38.899> up<00:01:39.899> or<00:01:40.200> down<00:01:40.380> well<00:01:40.920> they

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
in the chest plate up or down well they

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.789 
in the chest plate up or down well they
usually<00:01:41.130> adjust<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:41.759> way<00:01:41.990> right<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.590> up

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
usually adjust this way right like up

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.740 
usually adjust this way right like up
down<00:01:44.039> so<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.270> get<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> side-to-side

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
down so you can get the side-to-side

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.080 
down so you can get the side-to-side
movement<00:01:45.990> but<00:01:46.409> there's<00:01:47.250> no<00:01:47.429> shoulder<00:01:47.670> pad<00:01:47.880> on

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
movement but there's no shoulder pad on

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.109 
movement but there's no shoulder pad on
the<00:01:48.179> market<00:01:48.539> right<00:01:48.659> now<00:01:48.840> besides<00:01:49.080> X<00:01:49.500> flex<00:01:50.119> that

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
the market right now besides X flex that

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.080 
the market right now besides X flex that
goes<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:53.039> out<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.459> that's<00:01:53.640> supposed<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
goes in and out so that's supposed to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.589 
goes in and out so that's supposed to
give<00:01:54.299> more<00:01:55.280> movement<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.459> more<00:01:56.940> flexibility

00:01:57.589 --> 00:01:57.599 
give more movement and more flexibility

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:00.169 
give more movement and more flexibility
in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.349> pan<00:01:58.590> besides<00:01:59.429> just<00:01:59.640> the<00:01:59.729> up<00:01:59.879> and<00:02:00.060> down

00:02:00.169 --> 00:02:00.179 
in the pan besides just the up and down

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.380 
in the pan besides just the up and down
so<00:02:00.599> we're<00:02:01.170> gonna<00:02:01.229> check<00:02:01.560> out<00:02:01.769> how<00:02:02.069> that<00:02:02.580> works

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
so we're gonna check out how that works

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.770 
so we're gonna check out how that works
this<00:02:03.690> is<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.989> front<00:02:05.030> here's<00:02:06.030> the<00:02:06.149> back<00:02:06.300> of<00:02:06.330> it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
this is the front here's the back of it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.150 
this is the front here's the back of it
the<00:02:07.170> back<00:02:07.349> doesn't<00:02:07.560> have<00:02:07.830> that<00:02:07.920> same

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the back doesn't have that same

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.559 
the back doesn't have that same
capability<00:02:08.340> because<00:02:08.849> obviously<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.420> don't

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
capability because obviously you don't

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.259 
capability because obviously you don't
need<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.259> you<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.220> doesn't<00:02:11.819> come<00:02:12.090> with<00:02:12.239> a

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
need it so you it doesn't come with a

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.089 
need it so you it doesn't come with a
back<00:02:12.569> plate<00:02:12.870> and<00:02:12.900> there's<00:02:13.410> no<00:02:13.560> back<00:02:13.860> click

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
back plate and there's no back click

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:15.650 
back plate and there's no back click
that<00:02:14.250> they<00:02:14.400> sell<00:02:14.670> but<00:02:14.910> I'm<00:02:15.060> guessing<00:02:15.540> with

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
that they sell but I'm guessing with

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.930 
that they sell but I'm guessing with
these<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.200> you<00:02:16.650> actually<00:02:16.860> can't<00:02:17.370> fit<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:17.819> in

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
these that you actually can't fit one in

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:20.059 
these that you actually can't fit one in
so<00:02:18.150> I'm<00:02:18.269> gonna<00:02:18.390> try<00:02:18.720> that<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.290> I'll<00:02:19.980> let

00:02:20.059 --> 00:02:20.069 
so I'm gonna try that out and I'll let

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.710 
so I'm gonna try that out and I'll let
you<00:02:20.220> guys<00:02:20.310> know<00:02:20.550> what<00:02:21.000> I<00:02:21.030> find<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> now<00:02:23.720> let's

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
you guys know what I find so now let's

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420 
you guys know what I find so now let's
take<00:02:24.870> a<00:02:24.930> look<00:02:25.110> at<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.290> shoulder<00:02:25.800> pieces<00:02:26.159> these

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
take a look at the shoulder pieces these

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.729 
take a look at the shoulder pieces these
are<00:02:26.629> smaller<00:02:27.629> you<00:02:28.200> can<00:02:28.290> see<00:02:28.470> that<00:02:28.590> there's

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
are smaller you can see that there's

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:29.960 
are smaller you can see that there's
still<00:02:28.830> two<00:02:29.069> layers<00:02:29.280> here<00:02:29.400> but<00:02:29.700> smaller<00:02:29.909> than

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
still two layers here but smaller than

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.790 
still two layers here but smaller than
like<00:02:30.300> other<00:02:30.569> pads<00:02:30.900> that<00:02:31.230> I've<00:02:31.440> had<00:02:31.650> in<00:02:31.769> the

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
like other pads that I've had in the

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.330 
like other pads that I've had in the
past<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.599> then<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:34.170> technology<00:02:34.769> is<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.190> of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
past and then the technology is kind of

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.070 
past and then the technology is kind of
using<00:02:35.670> those<00:02:35.879> same<00:02:36.090> pots<00:02:36.390> that<00:02:36.599> are<00:02:36.750> in<00:02:36.900> the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
using those same pots that are in the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
using those same pots that are in the
zenith<00:02:37.409> helmets<00:02:37.970> so<00:02:38.970> it's<00:02:39.090> supposed<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.300> be

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
zenith helmets so it's supposed to be

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.300 
zenith helmets so it's supposed to be
really<00:02:39.599> comfortable<00:02:39.840> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.650> see<00:02:40.800> what's<00:02:41.099> on
