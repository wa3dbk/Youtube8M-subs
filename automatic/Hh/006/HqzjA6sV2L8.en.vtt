ssh client our ftp client cyberduck is
the<00:00:31.019> one<00:00:31.170> i've<00:00:31.289> seen<00:00:31.529> other<00:00:31.859> people<00:00:32.160> use<00:00:32.550> for

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
the one i've seen other people use for

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
the one i've seen other people use for
this<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.180> since<00:00:33.390> I<00:00:33.510> figured<00:00:33.750> most<00:00:33.899> of<00:00:33.989> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
this so since I figured most of you

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.450 
this so since I figured most of you
already<00:00:34.200> have<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.559> we'll<00:00:35.040> just<00:00:35.219> go<00:00:35.340> ahead

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
already have that we'll just go ahead

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.340 
already have that we'll just go ahead
and<00:00:35.550> continue<00:00:35.700> using<00:00:36.300> that<00:00:36.450> so<00:00:36.750> let's<00:00:37.230> go

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
and continue using that so let's go

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.600 
and continue using that so let's go
ahead<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.500> get<00:00:37.649> started<00:00:37.770> we'll<00:00:38.160> open<00:00:38.370> up

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
ahead and get started we'll open up

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.910 
ahead and get started we'll open up
cyberduck<00:00:39.390> and<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.200> first<00:00:40.410> thing<00:00:40.620> we<00:00:40.710> need<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
cyberduck and the first thing we need to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.560 
cyberduck and the first thing we need to
do<00:00:41.190> is<00:00:41.430> go<00:00:41.879> over<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:43.260> select<00:00:43.920> open<00:00:44.570> connection

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
do is go over and select open connection

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.990 
do is go over and select open connection
over<00:00:46.200> on<00:00:46.320> the<00:00:46.410> top<00:00:46.590> left<00:00:46.860> corner<00:00:47.070> of<00:00:47.309> cyberduck

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
over on the top left corner of cyberduck

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.090 
over on the top left corner of cyberduck
now<00:00:48.629> that's<00:00:48.870> going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> bring<00:00:49.500> up<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.680> window<00:00:49.950> we

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
now that's going to bring up a window we

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
that option there will allow us to go
