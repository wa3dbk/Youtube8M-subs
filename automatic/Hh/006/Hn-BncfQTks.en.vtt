internet search is a very powerful tool
and<00:00:08.400> it<00:00:08.820> has<00:00:08.970> become<00:00:09.150> one<00:00:09.510> of<00:00:09.570> the<00:00:09.750> key<00:00:09.990> methods

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
and it has become one of the key methods

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.320 
and it has become one of the key methods
for<00:00:10.620> people<00:00:11.010> seeking<00:00:11.250> information<00:00:11.730> about

00:00:20.479 --> 00:00:20.489 
key shortfall of internet search is that

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:22.669 
key shortfall of internet search is that
computers<00:00:21.029> don't<00:00:21.300> understand<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.109> contents

one<00:00:33.750> consequence<00:00:34.379> of<00:00:34.620> this<00:00:34.829> is<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.460> is

00:00:35.599 --> 00:00:35.609 
one consequence of this is that it is

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
understand when you type in the question

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.499 
understand when you type in the question
this<00:01:37.590> time<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.070> can<00:01:38.250> get<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> perfect<00:01:38.759> inline
