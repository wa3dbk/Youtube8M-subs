angle corner for nice and nice thin
angle<00:01:07.370> gonna<00:01:07.550> blowed<00:01:07.880> and<00:01:08.150> cut<00:01:08.990> about<00:01:09.590> three

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.070 
angle gonna blowed and cut about three

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.430 
angle gonna blowed and cut about three
or<00:01:10.550> four<00:01:10.850> sections<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.780> I've<00:01:11.870> cut<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.230> one

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
or four sections so I've cut this one

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.970 
or four sections so I've cut this one
here<00:01:12.730> and<00:01:13.730> that<00:01:13.760> one<00:01:14.000> there<00:01:14.410> that<00:01:15.410> one<00:01:15.470> there

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:15.980 
here and that one there that one there

here and that one there that one there
and<00:01:16.340> that<00:01:17.120> one<00:01:17.300> there<00:01:17.540> so<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.680> next<00:01:18.890> tip<00:01:19.160> is

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
and that one there so the next tip is

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:28.000 
and that one there so the next tip is
the<00:01:20.090> easiest<00:01:20.570> step<00:01:24.670> or<00:01:25.960> an<00:01:26.960> audix<00:01:27.410> walk<00:01:27.860> I've

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
the easiest step or an audix walk I've

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.810 
the easiest step or an audix walk I've
got<00:01:28.190> here<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.479> just<00:01:29.510> got<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:29.930> hit<00:01:30.110> it<00:01:30.820> and

cut straight through the brass into that
thread<00:02:36.349> and<00:02:37.159> as<00:02:37.280> soon<00:02:37.519> as<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.819> a<00:02:37.909> nice<00:02:38.090> clear

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
thread and as soon as it's a nice clear

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.500 
thread and as soon as it's a nice clear
hole<00:02:38.689> what<00:02:39.109> that<00:02:39.349> is<00:02:40.000> then<00:02:41.000> you<00:02:41.239> turn<00:02:41.420> it

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
hole what that is then you turn it

00:02:41.510 --> 00:03:13.530 
hole what that is then you turn it
around<00:02:41.599> stopping<00:02:42.079> the<00:02:42.170> other<00:02:42.319> side

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.960 

the<00:03:14.319> reason<00:03:14.709> the<00:03:14.799> sparks<00:03:15.250> are<00:03:15.370> coming<00:03:15.670> up<00:03:15.760> guys

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
the reason the sparks are coming up guys

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:18.780 
the reason the sparks are coming up guys
is<00:03:16.269> not<00:03:16.450> because<00:03:16.750> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:17.560> brass<00:03:17.799> brass<00:03:18.430> won't

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
is not because of the brass brass won't

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.940 
is not because of the brass brass won't
spark<00:03:19.239> when<00:03:19.510> you're<00:03:19.689> cutting<00:03:20.349> with<00:03:20.560> an<00:03:20.650> angle

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
spark when you're cutting with an angle

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.869 
spark when you're cutting with an angle
grinder<00:03:21.099> but<00:03:22.060> it's<00:03:22.239> only<00:03:22.360> because<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.810> this

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 
grinder but it's only because of this

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:26.670 
grinder but it's only because of this
steel<00:03:24.879> pipe<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.480> sort<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.170> spot<00:03:26.439> and<00:03:26.650> just

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
steel pipe you sort of spot and just

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.600 
steel pipe you sort of spot and just
they'll<00:03:26.890> cut<00:03:27.040> into<00:03:27.310> it<00:03:28.890> there's<00:03:29.890> three<00:03:30.340> they<00:03:30.579> I

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 
they'll cut into it there's three they I

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.420 
they'll cut into it there's three they I
can't<00:03:30.730> get<00:03:31.180> into<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.420> one<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:32.019> could<00:03:32.980> do

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
can't get into that one I could do

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.610 
can't get into that one I could do
another<00:03:33.640> cut<00:03:33.970> there<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.750> another<00:03:35.140> cut<00:03:35.440> for

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
another cut there and another cut for

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.550 
another cut there and another cut for
you<00:03:35.709> possibly<00:03:36.159> I<00:03:36.870> might<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:38.049> to<00:03:38.170> do<00:03:38.230> that<00:03:38.470> in

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
you possibly I might have to do that in

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:39.990 
you possibly I might have to do that in
the<00:03:38.650> wild<00:03:38.829> for<00:03:39.069> they<00:03:39.250> heat<00:03:39.430> and<00:03:39.640> see<00:03:39.849> what

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
the wild for they heat and see what

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.990 
the wild for they heat and see what
happens<00:03:40.299> so<00:03:44.310> basically<00:03:45.310> all<00:03:45.430> we're<00:03:45.670> doing<00:03:45.940> is

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
happens so basically all we're doing is

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.460 
happens so basically all we're doing is
hitting<00:03:46.180> it<00:03:46.450> there<00:03:46.659> and<00:03:46.840> just<00:03:46.900> breaking<00:03:47.260> the

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
hitting it there and just breaking the

00:03:47.470 --> 00:04:07.110 
hitting it there and just breaking the
brass<00:04:05.280> that's<00:04:06.280> it<00:04:06.459> guys

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.120
