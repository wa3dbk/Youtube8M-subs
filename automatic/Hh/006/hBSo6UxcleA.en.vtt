00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
little sharper when it was a 3-1 but

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.940 
little sharper when it was a 3-1 but
still<00:03:48.120> does<00:03:48.780> it<00:03:48.930> went<00:03:49.170> from<00:03:49.260> an<00:03:49.440> chesty<00:03:49.769> night

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
still does it went from an chesty night

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:51.800 
still does it went from an chesty night
in<00:03:50.100> my<00:03:50.220> opinion<00:03:50.519> a<00:03:50.700> great<00:03:51.330> performance

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
in my opinion a great performance

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.530 
in my opinion a great performance
overall<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.620> Newcastle<00:03:53.489> they<00:03:54.150> were<00:03:54.209> pretty

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
overall and Newcastle they were pretty

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.270 
overall and Newcastle they were pretty
good<00:03:54.810> for<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> first<00:03:55.110> 30<00:03:55.590> minutes<00:03:55.799> until<00:03:56.010> we

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
good for the first 30 minutes until we

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.830 
good for the first 30 minutes until we
scored<00:03:56.580> then<00:03:56.790> they<00:03:56.910> just<00:03:57.120> switched<00:03:57.390> off<00:03:57.660> they

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
scored then they just switched off they

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.440 
scored then they just switched off they
just<00:03:58.019> lost<00:03:58.560> all<00:03:58.890> confidence<00:03:59.549> and<00:04:00.030> looked<00:04:00.299> as

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
just lost all confidence and looked as

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.759 
just lost all confidence and looked as
though<00:04:00.480> they<00:04:00.690> were<00:04:00.720> already<00:04:01.049> beaten<00:04:01.440> so<00:04:01.620> they

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
though they were already beaten so they

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.090 
though they were already beaten so they
just<00:04:01.980> need<00:04:02.130> to<00:04:02.280> change<00:04:02.489> their<00:04:03.090> kind<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.510> their

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:04.100 
just need to change their kind of their

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.890 
just need to change their kind of their
morale<00:04:05.100> I<00:04:05.340> suppose<00:04:05.730> going<00:04:06.209> into<00:04:06.420> future<00:04:06.690> games

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
morale I suppose going into future games

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.750 
morale I suppose going into future games
obviously<00:04:07.110> this<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.739> for<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.340> bounce<00:04:08.519> that

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
obviously this is for on the bounce that

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:09.890 
obviously this is for on the bounce that
they've<00:04:08.940> lost<00:04:09.120> but<00:04:09.540> they've<00:04:09.660> done<00:04:09.780> that

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
they've lost but they've done that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.539 
they've lost but they've done that
before<00:04:10.200> this<00:04:10.320> season<00:04:10.530> then<00:04:10.830> they<00:04:10.950> went<00:04:11.070> on<00:04:11.190> own

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
before this season then they went on own

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.910 
before this season then they went on own
15<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.269> a<00:04:12.360> row<00:04:12.390> so<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.230> know<00:04:13.350> they<00:04:13.590> might<00:04:13.739> do

eight of them if they win would be five
point<00:04:32.310> seven<00:04:32.430> then<00:04:32.759> Spears<00:04:33.330> one<00:04:33.539> as<00:04:33.689> well<00:04:33.810> so<00:04:34.259> a

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
point seven then Spears one as well so a

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.899

six point eight of them it's all good at

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:37.339 
six point eight of them it's all good at
the<00:04:36.000> minute<00:04:36.210> we<00:04:36.300> play<00:04:36.479> spheres<00:04:36.780> in<00:04:36.930> two<00:04:37.110> days

00:04:37.339 --> 00:04:37.349 
the minute we play spheres in two days

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:39.439 
the minute we play spheres in two days
hopefully<00:04:38.099> Falcao<00:04:38.729> was<00:04:38.879> subbed<00:04:39.090> off<00:04:39.240> in<00:04:39.389> the

00:04:39.439 --> 00:04:39.449 
hopefully Falcao was subbed off in the

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.110 
hopefully Falcao was subbed off in the
60th<00:04:39.870> minute<00:04:39.930> probably<00:04:40.620> so<00:04:41.129> he's<00:04:41.460> fit<00:04:41.819> for

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
60th minute probably so he's fit for

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.420 
60th minute probably so he's fit for
that<00:04:42.379> and<00:04:43.379> yet<00:04:43.560> overall<00:04:43.919> I'm<00:04:44.039> really<00:04:44.189> really

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
that and yet overall I'm really really

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:47.990 
that and yet overall I'm really really
happy<00:04:44.610> I<00:04:44.759> can't<00:04:45.060> wait<00:04:45.270> for<00:04:45.419> the<00:04:45.479> spears<00:04:45.750> match
