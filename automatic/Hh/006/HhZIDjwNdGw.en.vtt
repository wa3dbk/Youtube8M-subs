00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:56.710 
there's a lot of factors in this I'll go

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.040 
there's a lot of factors in this I'll go
over<00:00:56.830> all<00:00:56.950> these<00:00:57.220> factors<00:00:57.820> on<00:00:57.970> the<00:00:58.000> DVD<00:00:58.600> coming

dagger<00:01:15.690> we're<00:01:16.690> going<00:01:16.840> to<00:01:16.930> do<00:01:17.050> dagger<00:01:17.470> style

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
dagger we're going to do dagger style

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.240 
dagger we're going to do dagger style
let's<00:01:19.960> say

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.149 

with<00:01:25.670> the<00:01:25.820> outline

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.060 

so<00:01:31.369> it's<00:01:31.520> kind<00:01:31.700> of<00:01:31.760> a<00:01:31.850> graffiti<00:01:32.500> twist<00:01:33.500> off<00:01:33.860> of

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
so it's kind of a graffiti twist off of

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.580 
so it's kind of a graffiti twist off of
Papa<00:01:34.340> oriental<00:01:35.150> style<00:01:36.340> twist<00:01:37.340> off<00:01:37.820> of<00:01:38.030> a

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
calligraphy style on it's a little bit

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.789 
calligraphy style on it's a little bit
of<00:01:42.259> an<00:01:42.440> inspiration<00:01:42.710> from<00:01:43.490> a<00:01:43.549> variety<00:01:43.940> of

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
of an inspiration from a variety of

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.630
