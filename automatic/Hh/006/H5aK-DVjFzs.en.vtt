00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
up through here and I hang just like a

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.429 
up through here and I hang just like a
Walmart<00:01:19.920> bag<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.460> some<00:01:21.180> empty<00:01:21.420> DVD<00:01:22.020> boxes

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
Walmart bag with some empty DVD boxes

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.469 
Walmart bag with some empty DVD boxes
it's<00:01:22.650> just<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.890> counterweight<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.759> because

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
it's just a counterweight so because

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.760 
it's just a counterweight so because
when<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.170> put<00:01:25.380> this<00:01:25.530> on<00:01:25.740> your<00:01:25.979> tripod<00:01:27.049> and<00:01:28.049> you

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
when you put this on your tripod and you

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.020 
when you put this on your tripod and you
have<00:01:28.920> your<00:01:29.070> camera<00:01:29.250> here<00:01:29.549> your<00:01:29.640> camera's

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
have your camera here your camera's

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
have your camera here your camera's
going<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.210> weigh<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> down<00:01:30.659> like<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.049> so<00:01:31.500> this

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
going to weigh it down like that so this

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.749 
going to weigh it down like that so this
little<00:01:32.009> thing<00:01:32.040> will<00:01:32.850> catch<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.720> bag<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.950> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
little thing will catch the bag and it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.700 
little thing will catch the bag and it
will<00:01:35.970> help<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.689> have<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.900> counterweight<00:01:37.290> so

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
will help you to have a counterweight so

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
will help you to have a counterweight so
that<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.310> can<00:01:38.490> balance<00:01:38.670> it<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.119> how<00:01:39.270> many
