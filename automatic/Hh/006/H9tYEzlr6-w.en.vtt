00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
really drinking this but I thought it

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.330 
really drinking this but I thought it
was<00:02:09.050> gonna<00:02:09.170> be<00:02:09.229> way<00:02:09.500> worse<00:02:09.740> and<00:02:10.010> I'm<00:02:10.160> actually

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
was gonna be way worse and I'm actually

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.100 
was gonna be way worse and I'm actually
surprised<00:02:10.910> it's<00:02:11.150> not<00:02:11.300> the<00:02:11.510> worst<00:02:11.750> thing<00:02:11.960> I've

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
surprised it's not the worst thing I've

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.620 
surprised it's not the worst thing I've
had<00:02:12.320> or<00:02:12.610> what<00:02:13.610> way<00:02:13.970> different<00:02:14.420> than<00:02:14.450> I

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
had or what way different than I

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.000 
had or what way different than I
expected<00:02:14.750> you<00:02:15.200> can<00:02:15.350> actually<00:02:15.530> taste<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
expected you can actually taste the

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.430 
expected you can actually taste the
maple<00:02:16.460> syrup<00:02:16.640> more<00:02:16.940> than<00:02:17.150> anything<00:02:17.360> else<00:02:17.660> it

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
maple syrup more than anything else it

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.080 
maple syrup more than anything else it
does<00:02:18.710> kind<00:02:19.040> of<00:02:19.070> remind<00:02:19.400> me<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.580> like<00:02:19.670> a<00:02:19.850> fine

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
does kind of remind me of like a fine

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.840 
does kind of remind me of like a fine
cognac<00:02:20.690> it<00:02:21.140> probably<00:02:21.650> would<00:02:21.830> be<00:02:21.980> like<00:02:22.010> a<00:02:22.220> not<00:02:22.820> a

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
cognac it probably would be like a not a

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.260 
cognac it probably would be like a not a
bad<00:02:23.150> beer<00:02:23.390> to<00:02:23.600> drink<00:02:23.870> if<00:02:24.020> you're<00:02:24.140> gonna<00:02:24.350> like

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.270 
bad beer to drink if you're gonna like

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:27.940 
bad beer to drink if you're gonna like
smoke<00:02:26.270> a<00:02:26.300> cigar<00:02:26.540> with<00:02:26.780> I<00:02:27.140> would<00:02:27.260> love<00:02:27.410> to<00:02:27.560> take

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
smoke a cigar with I would love to take

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.680 
smoke a cigar with I would love to take
a<00:02:27.980> cigar<00:02:28.400> and<00:02:28.580> dip<00:02:28.760> the<00:02:28.910> end<00:02:29.060> of<00:02:29.210> it<00:02:29.360> and<00:02:29.510> then

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
a cigar and dip the end of it and then

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.810 
a cigar and dip the end of it and then
take<00:02:30.380> that<00:02:30.530> maple<00:02:30.890> syrup<00:02:30.920> taste<00:02:31.460> as<00:02:31.670> you're

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:31.820 
take that maple syrup taste as you're

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:34.380 
take that maple syrup taste as you're
pulling<00:02:32.000> a<00:02:32.210> drag<00:02:32.450> of<00:02:32.480> a<00:02:32.690> cigar<00:02:33.020> into<00:02:33.230> it<00:02:33.470> I

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
pulling a drag of a cigar into it I

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.220 
pulling a drag of a cigar into it I
thought<00:02:35.390> it<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.600> gonna<00:02:35.690> be<00:02:35.810> worse<00:02:35.990> but<00:02:36.170> I

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
thought it was gonna be worse but I

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.800 
thought it was gonna be worse but I
gotta<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.590> honest<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.210> it's<00:02:38.210> not<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.600> worst

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
gotta be honest that it's not the worst

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.810 
gotta be honest that it's not the worst
flavor<00:02:39.020> of<00:02:39.230> your<00:02:39.380> head<00:02:39.530> but<00:02:40.280> the<00:02:40.610> alcohol

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
flavor of your head but the alcohol

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.550 
flavor of your head but the alcohol
burned<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.480> mean<00:02:41.630> it's<00:02:41.780> it<00:02:42.050> burns<00:02:42.290> like

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
burned I mean it's it burns like

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.200 
burned I mean it's it burns like
straight<00:02:43.160> alcohol<00:02:43.580> it<00:02:43.730> don't<00:02:43.880> taste<00:02:44.120> like

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.210 
straight alcohol it don't taste like

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:46.930 
straight alcohol it don't taste like
beer<00:02:44.720> I<00:02:44.870> would<00:02:45.200> not<00:02:45.440> classify<00:02:46.070> this<00:02:46.130> as<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.640> beer

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
beer I would not classify this as a beer

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.170 
beer I would not classify this as a beer
in<00:02:47.090> any<00:02:47.240> way<00:02:47.420> shape<00:02:47.690> or<00:02:47.870> form<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:49.400> don't<00:02:50.060> know

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
in any way shape or form I don't know

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.910 
in any way shape or form I don't know
how<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.450> would<00:02:50.780> grade<00:02:51.080> something<00:02:51.410> like<00:02:51.709> this

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
how I would grade something like this

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.830 
how I would grade something like this
but<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.940> definitely<00:02:56.180> one<00:02:56.600> of<00:02:56.660> the<00:02:56.720> most

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
but it's definitely one of the most

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.630 
but it's definitely one of the most
unique<00:02:57.230> beers<00:02:57.560> I've<00:02:57.770> ever<00:02:57.920> had<00:02:58.160> in<00:02:58.280> my<00:02:58.310> life

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
unique beers I've ever had in my life

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.030 
unique beers I've ever had in my life
because<00:02:59.510> I<00:02:59.720> would<00:02:59.930> not<00:03:00.050> classify<00:03:00.320> it<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.830> a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
because I would not classify it as a

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.600 
because I would not classify it as a
beer<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.970> smells<00:03:02.270> too<00:03:02.570> potent<00:03:02.989> but<00:03:03.650> anyway<00:03:04.400> I'm

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:04.610
