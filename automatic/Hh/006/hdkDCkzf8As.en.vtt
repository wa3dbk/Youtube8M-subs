00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:08.870
 I wanted to talk to you about comfrey 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.750
 in this little video so the comfrey 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:13.610
 it is the queen of nourishing plants 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.449
 so much she brings minerals to 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:19.220
 So much the door of elements 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.530
 necessary and useful 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.900
 so it's a plant that once 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:26.570
 that it is installed very difficult to 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.119
 remove because she has very strong roots 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.980
 deep and precisely with its roots 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.850
 it's thanks to its roots so deep 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.190
 that it brings to the surface every 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.870
 elements that are very useful for the 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.270
 other plants to feed the soil 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.329
 so it's a plant that we use 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.030
 really mainly as fertilizer on 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.719
 should plant a foot conso 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.750
 each fruit tree then the consoles 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.239
 so we can make some purine as the 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.739
 nettle manure the purine comfrey goes 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.860
 feed your plants 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:03.850
 she will fertilize the soil the scope of 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:06.649
 the zot so really very useful 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.810
 it can also be used in cooking on 

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:10.250
 can make donuts from leaves of 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.600
 conso of which we take the young leaves 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.369
 so for young leaves one can 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.549
 also make juices so me 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.650
 I use juices with juices 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.480
 carrot so I put some leaves 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.510
 of 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:25.450
 comfrey young leaves and juice 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:27.970
 of carrot so conso of these cons welded 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:30.070
 it's welded together it's really 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.760
 very very useful it's also a 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.980
 plant that can bring a lot of 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.870
 general benefits on the body 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:40.510
 now 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:41.980
 you must not eat too much so 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.080
 you can do a little cure like 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:45.130
 it's a few days 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.370
 precisely when it's springtime it's 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:56.740
 the moment while you say other 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:58.420
 still on comfrey yes that's what I 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.160
 wanted to tell you is that so there is 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:04.000
 different kinds of comfrey there is the 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:07.450
 consul of russia booking 14 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.690
 so this is a console that is not going 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.200
 to sow it is interesting because 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.330
 that precisely this console you go 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.860
 the plant is certainly she goes she goes 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.100
 grow up she's still going to take her 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:25.480
 space put it will produce about 30 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.830
 kg of leaves a year so it will be 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:29.800
 leaves that will always be useful 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:32.500
 to feed the fruit tree at the foot 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.300
 which she will be there or to feed your 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.980
 goals for example one can use it 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.360
 as a vegetal cover we can put 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.740
 that at the foot of tomatoes and but the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.630
 problem is that if you put the 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.420
 wild comfrey so those that 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.390
 find 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.790
 usually everywhere is the one that is 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.090
 ressÃ¨ment is then the risk with that 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:56.120
 Comfrey is going to end up 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.959
 very well she will multiply a lot 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.670
 too much actually 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.989
 once as I wanted to say we 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.120
 play uninstall we do not know anymore 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.950
 remove it so that could be 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.310
 interesting especially in small 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:10.160
 spaces and small gardens to choose 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.720
 the comfrey of russia so you 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.010
 may be found in nursery or 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.670
 so if you know someone who 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.140
 has one 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.750
 request 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.940
 a small 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.510
 a little piece of root and she 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.760
 will resume because really the console 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.520
 even in small gardens it takes 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:30.550
 have at least some or one of that 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.790
 depends on your space so she goes 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:37.630
 to bring you material to put on 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.830
 the soil and to make your purine and so 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:44.830
 this is really a plant 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:47.160
 indispensable soon see you in a 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.160
 other video
