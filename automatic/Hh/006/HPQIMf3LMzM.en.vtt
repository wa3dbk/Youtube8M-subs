00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.840 
pretty much i'm looking at the
definition<00:00:16.619> right<00:00:17.130> now<00:00:17.279> for<00:00:17.520> what<00:00:17.670> an

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
definition right now for what an

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.950 
definition right now for what an
extravaganza<00:00:18.660> is<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.800> says<00:00:20.070> an<00:00:20.310> elaborate

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960

spectacular entertainment or display so

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.960 
spectacular entertainment or display so
hopefully<00:00:24.359> this<00:00:24.510> can<00:00:24.750> be<00:00:25.670> essentially<00:00:26.670> all<00:00:26.910> of

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
hopefully this can be essentially all of

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.330 
hopefully this can be essentially all of
that<00:00:27.330> put<00:00:27.570> together<00:00:27.900> into<00:00:28.529> this<00:00:28.650> one<00:00:28.920> series

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
and so we're hopefully hoping that this

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.440 
and so we're hopefully hoping that this
will<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.070> elaborate<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.910> will<00:00:33.300> be

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.910 
for 300 or 250 or whatever it is i
thought<00:02:27.270> i<00:02:27.300> could<00:02:27.510> sell<00:02:27.690> these<00:02:27.900> guys<00:02:28.170> I<00:02:28.530> picked

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
thought i could sell these guys I picked

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.330 
thought i could sell these guys I picked
them<00:02:29.040> up<00:02:29.130> for<00:02:29.310> 250<00:02:30.030> coins<00:02:30.270> I<00:02:31.050> mean<00:02:31.440> I<00:02:31.650> discard

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
them up for 250 coins I mean I discard

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:33.770 
them up for 250 coins I mean I discard
them<00:02:32.460> for<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.850> than<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.180> bought<00:02:33.390> him<00:02:33.540> for

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
them for more than what I bought him for

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.230 
them for more than what I bought him for
so<00:02:34.350> it's<00:02:34.620> not<00:02:34.890> really<00:02:35.190> a<00:02:35.220> loss<00:02:35.490> but<00:02:35.970> i<00:02:36.030> thought

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
so it's not really a loss but i thought

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:37.490 
so it's not really a loss but i thought
i<00:02:36.300> could<00:02:36.510> sell<00:02:36.720> them<00:02:36.810> for<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.020> little<00:02:37.200> bit<00:02:37.350> more

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
i could sell them for a little bit more

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.410 
i could sell them for a little bit more
and<00:02:37.560> i<00:02:37.770> just<00:02:38.010> i<00:02:38.130> really<00:02:38.490> couldn't<00:02:38.760> they<00:02:39.210> seem

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
and i just i really couldn't they seem

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.300 
and i just i really couldn't they seem
like<00:02:39.570> decent<00:02:39.720> players<00:02:40.110> but<00:02:40.500> just<00:02:41.160> the

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
like decent players but just the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:42.440 
like decent players but just the
league's<00:02:41.520> they<00:02:41.730> were<00:02:41.790> in<00:02:42.000> there<00:02:42.210> in<00:02:42.360> the

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
league's they were in there in the

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.680 
league's they were in there in the
tipple<00:02:42.750> egan<00:02:43.050> tip<00:02:43.380> tip<00:02:43.770> silligan<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.490> so<00:02:45.330> it

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
tipple egan tip tip silligan and so it

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.600 
tipple egan tip tip silligan and so it
just<00:02:45.960> didn't<00:02:46.590> go<00:02:46.620> out<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> I<00:02:47.040> just<00:02:47.370> ended<00:02:47.550> up

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
just didn't go out to I just ended up

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.370 
just didn't go out to I just ended up
discarding<00:02:48.150> them<00:02:48.240> get<00:02:48.510> like<00:02:48.690> an<00:02:48.900> extra<00:02:49.170> ten

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
discarding them get like an extra ten

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.410 
discarding them get like an extra ten
coins<00:02:49.590> didn't<00:02:49.950> really<00:02:50.100> do<00:02:50.220> much<00:02:50.400> but<00:02:50.910> after

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
coins didn't really do much but after

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.700 
coins didn't really do much but after
that<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.600> ended<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:51.990> having<00:02:52.170> about<00:02:52.500> two

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
right if you use the left stick to go

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.350 
right if you use the left stick to go
right<00:05:19.949> over<00:05:19.979> the<00:05:20.430> goalie<00:05:20.669> and<00:05:20.819> just<00:05:20.940> aim<00:05:21.090> up<00:05:21.270> a

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360 
right over the goalie and just aim up a

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.360 
right over the goalie and just aim up a
little<00:05:21.569> bit<00:05:21.690> if<00:05:21.900> even<00:05:22.650> if<00:05:22.740> they<00:05:22.889> don't<00:05:23.129> move

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
little bit if even if they don't move

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.499 
little bit if even if they don't move
they<00:05:23.580> think<00:05:23.789> you're<00:05:23.909> going<00:05:24.090> down<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.330> middle

00:05:24.499 --> 00:05:24.509 
they think you're going down the middle

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.390 
they think you're going down the middle
they<00:05:24.810> have<00:05:25.020> to<00:05:25.169> push<00:05:25.349> the<00:05:25.560> up<00:05:25.949> on<00:05:26.069> the<00:05:26.189> left

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
they have to push the up on the left

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.429 
they have to push the up on the left
stick<00:05:26.580> so<00:05:26.849> if<00:05:27.479> they<00:05:27.629> don't<00:05:27.810> push<00:05:27.960> the<00:05:28.110> up<00:05:28.229> then

00:05:28.429 --> 00:05:28.439 
stick so if they don't push the up then

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:30.350 
stick so if they don't push the up then
you<00:05:28.590> get<00:05:28.740> a<00:05:28.770> pretty<00:05:29.189> easy<00:05:29.400> goal<00:05:29.669> so<00:05:30.120> right

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360
