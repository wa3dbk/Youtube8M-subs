all<00:00:08.690> right<00:00:09.690> now<00:00:10.260> in<00:00:10.440> this<00:00:10.559> video<00:00:10.800> we<00:00:11.099> will

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
all right now in this video we will

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.749 
all right now in this video we will
study<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.820> GABA<00:00:12.090> receptor<00:00:13.040> GABA<00:00:14.040> receptor<00:00:14.580> is

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
study the GABA receptor GABA receptor is

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.529 
study the GABA receptor GABA receptor is
of<00:00:15.350> two<00:00:16.350> types<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:17.010> first<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.760> gaba<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.270> and

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
of two types the first is the gaba a and

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.170 
of two types the first is the gaba a and
the<00:00:18.660> gaba<00:00:18.869> receptor<00:00:19.850> the<00:00:20.850> gaba

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
the gaba receptor the gaba

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.310 
the gaba receptor the gaba
a<00:00:21.300> is<00:00:21.570> a<00:00:21.600> type<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:21.980> ionotropic<00:00:22.980> receptor<00:00:23.970> and

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
a is a type of ionotropic receptor and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.070 
a is a type of ionotropic receptor and
gaba<00:00:25.320> B<00:00:25.740> is<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:26.010> type<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.490> metabotropic<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
gaba B is a type of metabotropic or the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.439 
gaba B is a type of metabotropic or the
g-protein<00:00:28.439> coupled<00:00:29.010> receptor<00:00:29.519> but<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.269> this

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
g-protein coupled receptor but in this

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.840 
g-protein coupled receptor but in this
video<00:00:30.810> we<00:00:31.080> will<00:00:31.289> only<00:00:31.619> focus<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.369> kappa

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
video we will only focus on the kappa

look<00:02:54.489> at<00:02:54.670> some<00:02:55.000> of<00:02:55.150> the<00:02:55.270> drugs<00:02:55.690> which<00:02:56.650> act<00:02:56.980> on

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
look at some of the drugs which act on

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.539 
look at some of the drugs which act on
