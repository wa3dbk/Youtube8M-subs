00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.309
 nobody expected 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.480
 and with us it is just like us 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:13.830
 so that we did not talk 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.360
 have us from week to week and from 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.369
 month by month also increased in the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.250
 league and therefore earned and me 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.390
 you could see the guys from holly congratulations 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.710
 who want to physically present than 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.970
 we and therefore was not even so 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.849
 a lot says to implement but I am proud 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.570
 on my boys that we are very good today 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.489
 have played and very well 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.660
 collects plays after so the first 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.350
 20 minutes were not very much from us 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.780
 sovereign 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.219
 But with the goal we are better 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.629
 come in and after the second 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.850
 halfway we dominated the game 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.430
 Let's say we have no chances 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 more allowed and deserved 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.450
 gained not dissatisfied we 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.930
 actually have a pretty cool 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.010
 made 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.510
 I mean we are in the final 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.039
 come in as a national league team 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.270
 you have to do it first and yes we do 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.550
 are still happy that we are 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:59.460
 five goals more shot 13 opponents 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.930
 No , seriously, you should be patient 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 should not stay hectic anyway 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.809
 because conscious enjoyers become deep 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.799
 will stand and they have good 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.330
 did not have anything 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.369
 authorized and which will then forward 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.830
 We already knew we would shoot 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.200
 they fought and when you left 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.760
 Bundesliga 50 loses and that too 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.380
 other teams in their league like that 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.580
 then we can have butchered 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.610
 did not do everything wrong and 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.299
 I saw my boys who are not so 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.299
 well balanced 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.860
 good to talk about already because we are not 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.690
 have allowed chance that was under 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.000
 Under our first principle that was that 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.440
 what we wanted to achieve was that 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.970
 top priority is the sector security and 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.990
 that we will eventually score a goal 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.370
 we were already clear 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.810
 and if then against such an opponent 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.160
 first the first goal fell and 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.510
 you give a little space then 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.730
 you also do the second third 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:51.790
 fourth and then is a question of time 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.980
 the best moment was the drain where you 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.500
 I knew that you won now 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.450
 and now that's through her 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.920
 struggled struggling and that's what 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.660
 At least I ask and as I said 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.010
 as I said before if we have before 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.240
 already won and you quote 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:07.030
 they are more happy than their colleagues 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.010
 and that is very very positive and we 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.090
 Be the last three league games too 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:11.260
 still approach and if you too 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.120
 consolidate our second place 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.140
 and then we have really mega season 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 played and I'm on megastolz
