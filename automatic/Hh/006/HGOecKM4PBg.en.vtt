 the 

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:10.339
 the DTM 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:11.879
 Number 15 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:13.019
 origami 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.639
 Land arise 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.899
 Origami figures do not necessarily have to be pure decoration objects 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:19.380
 his 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.369
 a practical application is individual lampshades random 

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:28.119
 For this we need the book Origami lampshades with the necessary 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.649
 manual 

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.050
 paper 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.530
 duct tape 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.260
 if at the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:35.650
 and a pair of scissors 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.860
 instead of ordinary paper, the lamps should use paper that is appropriate 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.170
 cut transparent and I would be flammable 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.600
 the arch in our example is folded diagonally 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.000
 unfolded 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
 turned 90 degrees and again fal 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.100
 then we click the four corners so small that their tips in the 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.100
 Center back 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.800
 Now we turn the corners down again after the meeting 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:09.790
 but at first only with the tips to the newly created case line then 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.410
 complete 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.600
 the false bay one is a big help especially with this sturdy paper 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.350
 last we click the four new corners to the center and set it up 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.350
 the first lamp is driving a cow now 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.390
 that while there are enough elements for our screen here 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.390
 together 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.400
 with a narrow strip of double-sided tape we connect 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.400
 to keep the elements at their triangular 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.670
 In our example, we make a rectangular lame 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:09.700
 half the sheer is done after only four elements 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:18.189
 A matching rail put our lamp the necessary stability 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:23.579
 We fix the paper shade with a few strokes of the pen and screw it together 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:24.099
 the rails
