I<00:00:03.799> hey<00:00:04.799> guys<00:00:05.040> today<00:00:05.430> I<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.850> a<00:00:05.879> review<00:00:06.120> on

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:08.540 
I hey guys today I have a review on

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.379 
I hey guys today I have a review on
Omega<00:00:09.540> carabiner<00:00:10.670> now<00:00:11.670> this<00:00:11.910> is<00:00:12.059> used<00:00:12.269> for

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
Omega carabiner now this is used for

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.289 
Omega carabiner now this is used for
rock<00:00:12.660> climbing<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.500> have<00:00:14.309> one<00:00:14.519> for<00:00:14.700> careers<00:00:15.059> and

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
rock climbing I have one for careers and

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.099 
rock climbing I have one for careers and
also<00:00:15.599> here

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
also here

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.070 
also here
they're<00:00:16.500> both<00:00:16.650> rock<00:00:16.949> climbing<00:00:17.310> carabiners

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
they're both rock climbing carabiners

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.439 
they're both rock climbing carabiners
this<00:00:19.470> one<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:19.890> an<00:00:20.070> auto-locking<00:00:20.460> this<00:00:21.090> one's<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
this one is an auto-locking this one's a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.089 
this one is an auto-locking this one's a
screw<00:00:21.720> lock<00:00:22.369> and<00:00:23.369> both<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.180> them<00:00:24.330> I<00:00:24.859> think<00:00:25.859> they

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
screw lock and both of them I think they

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.310 
screw lock and both of them I think they
call<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.310> wire<00:00:26.609> locking<00:00:27.119> because<00:00:27.840> there's

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
call it wire locking because there's

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.089 
call it wire locking because there's
right<00:00:28.650> here<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.760> is<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:30.019> wire<00:00:31.040> that<00:00:32.040> goes

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
right here there is a wire that goes

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.459 
right here there is a wire that goes
into<00:00:32.730> here<00:00:34.370> so<00:00:35.370> when<00:00:36.180> it<00:00:36.270> flips<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.840> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
into here so when it flips there it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.200 
into here so when it flips there it's
almost<00:00:37.649> impossible<00:00:38.040> to<00:00:38.430> get<00:00:38.610> undone

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
almost impossible to get undone

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.630 
almost impossible to get undone
this<00:00:40.079> one<00:00:40.350> right<00:00:40.469> here<00:00:40.530> can<00:00:41.100> hold<00:00:42.140> just<00:00:43.140> about

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
this one right here can hold just about

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.630 
this one right here can hold just about
10<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:45.059> 15<00:00:45.480> kilotons<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:47.250> one<00:00:47.520> right

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
10 to 15 kilotons and this one right

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.680 
10 to 15 kilotons and this one right
here<00:00:47.910> well<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:50.059> closed<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.510> hold<00:00:53.690> 223

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
here well it's closed can hold 223

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.840 
here well it's closed can hold 223
kilotons<00:00:55.320> I<00:00:55.620> don't<00:00:56.219> know<00:00:56.280> what<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.489> amounts

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
kilotons I don't know what that amounts

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.840 
kilotons I don't know what that amounts
to<00:00:57.030> in<00:00:57.270> pounds<00:00:57.690> but<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.020> a<00:00:58.109> lot<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.890> while

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
to in pounds but it's a lot and while

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.320 
to in pounds but it's a lot and while
it's<00:01:00.000> open<00:01:00.210> eight<00:01:00.780> tons<00:01:02.899> so<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.229> also<00:01:04.500> weighs

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
it's open eight tons so it also weighs

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.649 
it's open eight tons so it also weighs
150<00:01:06.330> grams<00:01:07.159> gate<00:01:08.159> clearance<00:01:08.729> is<00:01:08.939> 24

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
150 grams gate clearance is 24

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.240 
150 grams gate clearance is 24
millimeters<00:01:11.119> that<00:01:12.119> whole<00:01:12.420> thing<00:01:12.689> nothing

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
millimeters that whole thing nothing

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.469 
millimeters that whole thing nothing
really<00:01:14.250> special<00:01:14.640> here<00:01:14.970> but<00:01:15.119> there's<00:01:15.270> two

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
really special here but there's two

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.690 
really special here but there's two
major<00:01:15.810> things<00:01:16.259> here<00:01:16.680> well<00:01:17.220> number<00:01:17.369> one<00:01:17.580> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
major things here well number one the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.600 
major things here well number one the
size<00:01:17.909> if<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.240> look<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.509> this<00:01:18.689> crater<00:01:19.110> that

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
size if you look at this crater that

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.420 
size if you look at this crater that
size<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.850> very<00:01:21.210> big<00:01:21.590> difference<00:01:22.590> here<00:01:22.799> but

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
size is very big difference here but

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.109 
size is very big difference here but
this<00:01:23.729> one<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.479> screw<00:01:25.020> locking<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.700> screw

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
this one is a screw locking so you screw

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.899 
this one is a screw locking so you screw
this<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.600> lock<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909 
this to lock it

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:31.730 
this to lock it
and<00:01:29.909> now<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.450> can't<00:01:30.780> undo<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.619> run

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
and now you can't undo it you can run

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.060 
and now you can't undo it you can run
this<00:01:31.829> over<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.250> cart<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:32.880> won't<00:01:33.060> break

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
this over with a cart and it won't break

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:39.859 
this over with a cart and it won't break
open<00:01:35.100> I<00:01:35.250> mean<00:01:35.549> break<00:01:35.909> open<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.659> one

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
open I mean break open this you do one

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.160 
open I mean break open this you do one
turn<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:40.530> push<00:01:40.950> down<00:01:41.390> and<00:01:42.390> then<00:01:42.600> when<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:42.990> let

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
turn and push down and then when you let

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.450 
turn and push down and then when you let
go<00:01:43.200> it<00:01:45.380> see<00:01:46.380> if<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.530> get<00:01:46.680> done<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> video<00:01:47.070> for<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
go it see if I get done a video for you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.010 
go it see if I get done a video for you
it<00:01:47.640> goes<00:01:48.290> in<00:01:49.290> flips<00:01:49.710> back<00:01:50.600> so<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.840> is

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
it goes in flips back so this is

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.539 
it goes in flips back so this is
obviously<00:01:52.229> made<00:01:52.619> in<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.799> US<00:01:53.100> because<00:01:53.310> there's

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
obviously made in the US because there's

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.620 
obviously made in the US because there's
a<00:01:53.640> u.s.<00:01:54.000> thing<00:01:54.689> there<00:01:55.130> I<00:01:56.299> don't<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.540> they

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
a u.s. thing there I don't think they

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.840 
a u.s. thing there I don't think they
have<00:01:57.750> different<00:01:58.170> colors<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.979> this<00:01:59.250> but<00:01:59.640> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
have different colors on this but this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.719 
have different colors on this but this
is<00:02:00.060> a<00:02:00.090> blue<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:00.740> I'm<00:02:01.740> guessing<00:02:02.369> they<00:02:02.490> probably

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
is a blue one I'm guessing they probably

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.080 
is a blue one I'm guessing they probably
don't<00:02:02.969> but

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
don't but

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.370 
don't but
it's<00:02:06.090> very<00:02:06.420> strong<00:02:06.780> so<00:02:08.360> you<00:02:09.360> can<00:02:09.869> make<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> quick

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
it's very strong so you can make a quick

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.200 
it's very strong so you can make a quick
draw<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:11.009> these<00:02:11.130> if<00:02:11.430> you<00:02:11.460> really<00:02:11.910> wanted

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
draw out of these if you really wanted

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:15.500 
draw out of these if you really wanted
to<00:02:12.270> if<00:02:12.750> you<00:02:12.960> had<00:02:13.200> to<00:02:13.440> and<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:14.210> don't<00:02:15.210> have

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
to if you had to and you don't have

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.160 
to if you had to and you don't have
enough<00:02:16.380> carabiners<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.220> can<00:02:17.400> grab<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.450> webbing

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
enough carabiners you can grab a webbing

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.320 
enough carabiners you can grab a webbing
or<00:02:19.440> a<00:02:19.620> cord<00:02:20.040> something<00:02:20.400> like<00:02:20.490> that<00:02:20.670> or<00:02:21.270> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
or a cord something like that or a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.250 
or a cord something like that or a
runner<00:02:21.630> a<00:02:21.870> runner<00:02:21.930> would<00:02:22.350> work<00:02:22.560> too<00:02:22.740> and<00:02:24.260> go

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
runner a runner would work too and go

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.320 
runner a runner would work too and go
like<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.440> you'd<00:02:26.250> have<00:02:26.280> very<00:02:26.670> strong<00:02:26.970> this

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
like that you'd have very strong this

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.410 
like that you'd have very strong this
would<00:02:27.540> hook<00:02:27.660> you<00:02:27.840> onto<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.200> wall<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.420> then

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
would hook you onto the wall and then

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.100 
would hook you onto the wall and then
this<00:02:30.750> would<00:02:31.460> hold<00:02:32.460> the<00:02:32.760> rope<00:02:32.970> or<00:02:33.840> the<00:02:33.960> other

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
this would hold the rope or the other

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.130 
this would hold the rope or the other
way<00:02:34.200> around<00:02:34.230> whichever<00:02:34.650> way<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:35.100> I<00:02:36.140> also

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
way around whichever way like I also

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.380 
way around whichever way like I also
have<00:02:37.380> a<00:02:37.410> couple<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.010> other<00:02:38.720> types<00:02:39.720> of

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
have a couple of other types of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:44.390 
have a couple of other types of
carabiners<00:02:42.390> here<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:43.110> show<00:02:43.350> you<00:02:43.440> guys<00:02:43.620> they're

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
carabiners here to show you guys they're

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.880 
carabiners here to show you guys they're
not<00:02:44.550> necessarily<00:02:45.390> carabiners<00:02:48.140> this<00:02:49.140> one<00:02:49.470> you

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
not necessarily carabiners this one you

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.350 
not necessarily carabiners this one you
would<00:02:50.040> find<00:02:50.370> in<00:02:50.640> more<00:02:50.850> of<00:02:50.970> an<00:02:51.060> industrial

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
would find in more of an industrial

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.750 
would find in more of an industrial
environment<00:02:52.230> still<00:02:52.950> can<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.220> used<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> rock

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
environment still can be used to rock

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.360 
environment still can be used to rock
climbing<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.290> do<00:02:55.470> see<00:02:55.890> these<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.220> rock

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
climbing because I do see these and rock

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.490 
climbing because I do see these and rock
climbing<00:02:56.490> walls<00:02:56.910> these<00:02:57.810> would<00:02:58.050> be<00:02:58.170> attached

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
climbing walls these would be attached

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.250 
climbing walls these would be attached
to<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> wall<00:02:59.040> and<00:02:59.280> then<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.550> clip<00:02:59.910> a

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
to the wall and then you clip a

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:09.040 
to the wall and then you clip a
quick-draw<00:03:01.260> on<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:04.910> just<00:03:05.910> like<00:03:06.000> that

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:12.470 

there's<00:03:10.050> also<00:03:10.290> this<00:03:10.640> it's<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.910> exact<00:03:12.269> same

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
there's also this it's the exact same

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:18.470 
there's also this it's the exact same
thing<00:03:13.580> this<00:03:14.580> unscrews<00:03:16.790> just<00:03:17.790> like<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.180> one

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
thing this unscrews just like this one

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.920 
thing this unscrews just like this one
but<00:03:18.989> this<00:03:19.140> is<00:03:19.200> just<00:03:19.620> screw<00:03:19.980> locking<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.670> is<00:03:20.910> not

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.160 

it<00:03:24.930> is<00:03:24.989> not<00:03:25.320> it<00:03:26.450> doesn't<00:03:27.450> have<00:03:27.600> a<00:03:27.630> gate<00:03:27.840> sorry

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
it is not it doesn't have a gate sorry

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.320 
it is not it doesn't have a gate sorry
about<00:03:28.350> that<00:03:28.380> it's<00:03:28.950> not<00:03:29.070> have<00:03:29.190> a<00:03:29.250> gate<00:03:29.430> and<00:03:29.910> this

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:30.330 
about that it's not have a gate and this

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.620 
about that it's not have a gate and this
is<00:03:30.540> also<00:03:30.840> screw<00:03:31.080> locking<00:03:31.440> also<00:03:32.510> because<00:03:33.510> it

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
is also screw locking also because it

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:35.000 
is also screw locking also because it
doesn't<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.019> gate<00:03:34.260> so<00:03:34.470> it's<00:03:34.590> just<00:03:34.769> screw

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
doesn't have a gate so it's just screw

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.820 
doesn't have a gate so it's just screw
locking<00:03:35.430> only<00:03:38.720> so<00:03:39.720> these<00:03:39.870> are<00:03:40.080> very<00:03:40.290> good<00:03:40.590> to

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
locking only so these are very good to

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:45.830 
locking only so these are very good to
attach<00:03:41.100> two<00:03:41.370> ropes<00:03:41.400> and<00:03:41.910> stuff<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.630> I<00:03:45.660> have<00:03:45.810> a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
attach two ropes and stuff so I have a

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.360 
attach two ropes and stuff so I have a
rope<00:03:46.140> at<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.380> figure-eight<00:03:46.769> knot<00:03:46.980> in<00:03:47.459> it<00:03:49.370> that

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
rope at the figure-eight knot in it that

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.229 
rope at the figure-eight knot in it that
easy<00:03:51.080> don't<00:03:52.080> want<00:03:52.230> to<00:03:52.290> do<00:03:52.410> this<00:03:52.560> one<00:03:52.769> too<00:03:53.239> it

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
easy don't want to do this one too it

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.040 
easy don't want to do this one too it
could<00:03:55.610> so<00:03:56.610> very<00:03:56.880> easy<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.330> attach<00:03:57.720> two

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
could so very easy to attach two

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.539 
could so very easy to attach two
harnesses<00:03:58.350> and<00:04:00.590> other<00:04:01.590> ropes<00:04:01.980> or<00:04:02.280> even<00:04:02.459> two

00:04:02.539 --> 00:04:02.549 
harnesses and other ropes or even two

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.330 
harnesses and other ropes or even two
walls<00:04:02.850> or<00:04:03.360> make<00:04:04.019> quick<00:04:04.380> drawers<00:04:04.709> if<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.100> need

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
walls or make quick drawers if you need

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.420 
walls or make quick drawers if you need
more<00:04:05.690> but<00:04:06.690> it<00:04:06.780> is<00:04:06.989> very<00:04:07.140> big<00:04:07.470> this<00:04:07.769> size<00:04:08.220> my

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
more but it is very big this size my

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.509 
more but it is very big this size my
hand<00:04:08.750> let's<00:04:09.750> see<00:04:10.049> you<00:04:10.830> have<00:04:10.950> anything<00:04:11.190> else<00:04:11.340> to

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
hand let's see you have anything else to

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.340 
hand let's see you have anything else to
compare<00:04:11.820> to<00:04:12.650> where's<00:04:13.650> my<00:04:14.010> phone

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350 
compare to where's my phone

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.330 
compare to where's my phone
here's<00:04:16.350> my<00:04:16.560> iPhone<00:04:17.070> compared<00:04:17.519> to<00:04:17.670> it

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
here's my iPhone compared to it

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:26.000 
here's my iPhone compared to it
very<00:04:20.340> big<00:04:20.910> there's<00:04:22.040> thickness<00:04:23.040> wise<00:04:24.860> and<00:04:25.860> the

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
very big there's thickness wise and the

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:27.620 
very big there's thickness wise and the
locking<00:04:26.400> gate<00:04:26.610> it's<00:04:27.030> just<00:04:27.270> about<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.570> same

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
locking gate it's just about the same

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.700 
locking gate it's just about the same
size<00:04:29.120> so<00:04:30.120> that's<00:04:30.240> size<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.110> then<00:04:31.260> this<00:04:31.470> to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
size so that's size and then this to

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.200 
size so that's size and then this to
just<00:04:31.919> basically<00:04:32.370> fit<00:04:32.700> on<00:04:32.940> it<00:04:33.000> there<00:04:33.710> this<00:04:35.210> yeah

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
just basically fit on it there this yeah

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.350 
just basically fit on it there this yeah
that<00:04:36.240> won't<00:04:37.010> but<00:04:38.010> that<00:04:38.040> size<00:04:38.610> comparison<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:39.360 
that won't but that size comparison and

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:41.450 
that won't but that size comparison and
everything<00:04:39.690> other<00:04:40.410> than<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.800> I<00:04:40.980> recommend

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
everything other than that I recommend

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.290 
everything other than that I recommend
this<00:04:41.669> carabiner

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
this carabiner

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.840 
this carabiner
it's<00:04:42.480> biomega<00:04:43.320> I'll<00:04:43.680> leave<00:04:43.860> it<00:04:43.980> down<00:04:44.190> in<00:04:44.520> the

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
it's biomega I'll leave it down in the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.060 
it's biomega I'll leave it down in the
underbar<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.870> was<00:04:46.220> $18<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.340> believe<00:04:47.580> from

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
underbar it was $18 I believe from

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.800 
underbar it was $18 I believe from
$18.25<00:04:50.070> from<00:04:50.480> REI<00:04:52.010> other<00:04:53.010> than<00:04:53.310> that<00:04:53.460> that's

basically it it's a great kind of

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.920 
basically it it's a great kind of
