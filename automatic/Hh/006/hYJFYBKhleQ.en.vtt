guess I I could never say bowls of bowls
a<00:00:33.690> proper<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.100> don't<00:00:35.399> know<00:00:35.550> which<00:00:35.760> one

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
a proper way so I don't know which one

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.319 
a proper way so I don't know which one
you're<00:00:36.630> really<00:00:37.079> hearing<00:00:37.380> but<00:00:37.860> balls<00:00:38.329> right

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
you're really hearing but balls right

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.940 
you're really hearing but balls right
and<00:00:39.690> they<00:00:39.899> were<00:00:39.960> really<00:00:40.200> cute<00:00:40.410> and<00:00:40.649> stuff<00:00:40.800> but

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
and they were really cute and stuff but

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.040 
and they were really cute and stuff but
the<00:00:41.219> same<00:00:41.399> thing<00:00:41.579> with<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.790> baggie<00:00:42.420> there's

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
the same thing with the baggie there's

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.080 
the same thing with the baggie there's
like<00:00:43.260> every<00:00:44.129> jewelry<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.579> top<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.879> each<00:00:44.969> other

like every jewelry on top of each other

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.639 
like every jewelry on top of each other
