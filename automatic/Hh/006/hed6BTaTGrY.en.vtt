00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.670
 very good to all and welcome to a 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.710
 new video I'm checking for everything 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.240
 He who does not know me and good as 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.999
 You see we are in front of the cave 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.160
 changing walter in game in English and it's 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.160
 that since the last patch they put 

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:19.189
 on the 27th in this cave appear more than 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.080
 20 different pokemon but that yes no 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.990
 appear randomly let's say that 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:26.419
 they follow a system divided into cycles is 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.439
 what I will explain more thoroughly 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.439
 that we go there 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.900
 ah 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.000
 no no 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.260
 before starting with the explanation of 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.300
 I love the cave system 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.090
 show where the cave is 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.710
 as you can see it is on island 6 and above 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:53.530
 everything truly has no loss is very 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.600
 easy to get to and so well said this 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.640
 we started with what has been what 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.340
 important is not how it works 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:03.070
 system first of all we have to know 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:05.230
 several things and that is that there is a total of 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.180
 seven cycles worth 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.880
 you have to keep in mind that six 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.490
 hours in real life are 24 hours 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.520
 within the game it is worth and that each cycle 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.650
 It lasts 24 hours inside the game what 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.800
 It means that each cycle will change 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:23.080
 once within 6 hours in real life you 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.119
 I'm going to show you an image to explain 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.150
 this much better and easier and apart 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.670
 so you can see that pokemon come out in each 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.460
 cycle is how you see in the image the 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.020
 system is divided into seven cycles in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.690
 truth is divided into seven cycles 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.850
 because if they were not because I piss 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.710
 divided so that each cycle went through 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.290
 every day of the week there are seven days in 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.000
 the week then there are seven cycles but 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.950
 as I told you before 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.560
 24 hours inside the game in because I 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.170
 Meo is one day is 6 hours 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.570
 out in the real life what is 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.300
 means that in a real day they spend 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.700
 really four cycles that's why 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.070
 I come to comment this a little more to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.860
 no background and good questions that you can 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:10.310
 spend is for example how do I know in 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.070
 cycle is the game right now or what 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 cycle comes later at what time does not stop 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.910
 that you simply have to fix in 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.340
 the time inside the game in poque I piss 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.290
 when the clock they implemented makes 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:24.830
 not much of because I see myself I got to the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.380
 0000 is done when the day ends 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.310
 Chinese in the game at 12 o'clock 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.250
 night 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.560
 say that leads to the following 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.660
 next cycle not and as you can know 

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.180
 in what cycle is it at that moment 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.580
 going to the cave and according to the pokemon that 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.250
 they are leaving you come here the video 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.110
 You see the image and you can already know in what 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.090
 cycle you are 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.950
 One thing that I have to discuss is 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.900
 that the main idea of these pokemon 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.990
 is not to implement it forever 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.400
 right now they are implemented 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:58.160
 temporarily that's why I've wanted 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:01.070
 make this video as soon as possible more 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:03.110
 that nothing because it assures us nothing that 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.850
 these we can go forever 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.650
 at least for now 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:09.110
 so take advantage now look at the 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.390
 cycles and we can interest them or not 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.360
 you have or as they are for example because 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:17.680
 very sought after is in the wagon the up sun 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:21.350
 the aaron is the côte are not pokemon 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.440
 quite good in addition in competitive and 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.959
 very sought after so you know how to take a 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.260
 eye calculate the hours right now to the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.780
 one of the afternoon I'm recording the 30th 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.989
 at one minus ten at one o'clock the 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:39.110
 cycle 6 right now was cycle 5 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.970
 because at one the cycle 6 begins if not 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:45.230
 I'm wrong 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:48.830
 and that will be the leap sun and others and it will last 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.230
 from one until six hours until 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.000
 seven in the afternoon before seven o'clock 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.730
 in the afternoon the video will have uploaded as well 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
 that until seven in the afternoon this 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.800
 day to day 30 you can go for the sun app 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.660
 that is the pokemon that I very much 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.820
 people are searching for the truth is a 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.670
 exquisite pokémon not to say it of 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.050
 some way and good guys a little more 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:11.780
 what to comment simply wanted 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:14.819
 explain how the system was going 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.310
 it was divided and how can you 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:19.320
 they managed today to know what system is 

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:22.109
 in what cycle do I mean what cycle 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.750
 comes later and you know that any 

00:04:22.109 --> 00:04:26.669
 doubt you have about this you can 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.250
 ask the comments I will answer without 

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:31.410
 any kind of problem and good guys 

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:33.810
