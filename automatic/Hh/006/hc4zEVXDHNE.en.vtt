00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.260
 welcome are like in this video os 

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.980
 I'm going to teach how to make a whirlpool 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.980
 water like this 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.100
 for this what we are going to need are 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.970
 two bottles of water or cola as 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:27.689
 you wanted with your plugs 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.150
 scissors a knife duct tape 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.220
 a lighter and a piece of plastic carries 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 to use a plastic from another stopper and 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.390
 we will also need if we want a 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.860
 drill bit or knife we ​​are going to 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.120
 do the holes worth we can do 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.829
 first with the bit and then finish 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.629
 do with the knife 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.239
 The first thing you are going to have to do is 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.890
 put together the two plugs I in this case 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.260
 I'm going to collect the plugs first because 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.479
 the hole I'm going to make with a drill 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.510
 It is worth to make the hole much better 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.589
 apart here do this tail I can do 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.329
 exactly where you want 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:58.949
 then if you want to do it with the 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.780
 knife first we have to do the 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.920
 holes and then hook it up okay but 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.500
 in this case, what I 'm going to do is 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.180
 directly the hooks and then I'll do 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.490
 the hole with the drill 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.950
 once we have made the holes if 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.930
 we see in this way how it would look 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.980
 you can make them a little bit bigger or 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.540
 smaller that is a bit with 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.730
 you want what we are going to do is 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.900
 cut a little of this plug 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.680
 with this hook we will do our 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.830
 plugs better then on top we will put a 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.050
 little sticky tape 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.620
 So what we are going to do is go 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.130
 burning slowly and going putting 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.280
 the molten plastic on top of a stopper and 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.080
 then we will put the other one over such 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.080
 way that will be better fixed 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.530
 and now we will hook the plug 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 let's do some pressure to 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.710
 that hooks well 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.570
 nobody have you hooked let's put 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.680
 also the flange really this what 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.330
 I'm doing to make it a little 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 better but putting only one hundred adhesive 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.340
 around would also be worth 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.369
 now we turn on then now 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:08.270
 let's burn the boards we light 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.270
 well the plastic 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.060
 and we are putting 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.120
 to cover this we do it so that 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:21.120
 No water escapes through here 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.519
 and we finish it closing everything well 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.799
 we already have it well stuck and what 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.629
 let's do is put duct tape 

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:31.920
 as I said before with a little bit of 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.160
 shiva would also be worth it but from this 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.610
 way will be better 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.080
 we cut we are going to cut more or less to the 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.900
 height of the two plugs this tape 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.900
 American if it's perfect and now what 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.910
 what we are going to do is carefully paste 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.060
 well the two plugs 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.170
 so we will reinforce the plastic that we have 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.620
 put and we will make sure you will not lose 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.480
 absolutely no water 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.440
 Well let's reinforce squeezing 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.170
 the fingers 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.780
 in this way and I'll put a little 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.130
 more than another ribbon 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.290
 to reinforce 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:13.190
 Here you can see water loss as 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.230
 otherwise the swirl will not form well 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:17.190
 as we see we already have it now 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.500
 if we want we can 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.780
 finish 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:24.770
 to make the holes fit like 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.470
 You see, we are taking away a bit of 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.470
 by plastics and it will be as round 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.660
 possible 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.560
 well here we have the bottle with the 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:37.240
 water we have put together the two bottles and 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.110
 here we have the bottle up here 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.550
 we have the empty bottle 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:42.530
 what we are going to do is turn it around 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:45.970
 and when we turn around here we have a little 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.970
 so that the swirl begins 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:51.330
 you see that it stops this is good that it 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.330
 stop and now 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:57.080
 that the swirl forms 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:22.550
 Now what we are going to do is add a 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.550
 little color 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.490
 the swirl do not go here 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.490
 Y 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:33.090
 and we 're going to take it, we're going to turn it 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:42.660
 let's use another dye 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.660
 now we are going to turn it 

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.139
 and here we go yes 

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:07.630
 nothing good so I hope you have 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.770
 liked the video as you see it is very 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.870
 simple to do here 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.090
 and if you liked it, you know how to give
