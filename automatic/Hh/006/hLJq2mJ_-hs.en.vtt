00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.690
 hello again we all play rast means u 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.880
 i'm very much tutorials now 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.769
 there will be a movie about what happens at night but 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.759
 Now let 's start the night and here it is 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.699
 tags and not the strongest night i mean i 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.710
 more or less here like everything I see here but 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.890
 they sunset saw other people like everyone 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:25.289
 just an urgent need to even sad at night 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.689
 nothing at all is now visible 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:33.210
 here a fire is lit for an example yet 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.790
 launched in and put out here let's stomach 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.700
 also means like a bribe so at night 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.320
 was visible without any there chats with 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.719
 in terms of lighting 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.200
 but we can stupidly turn on the fire means 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:48.660
 then everything here light and click on e and o 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.309
 pamm account us ended here finished 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.500
 from a tree 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.500
 so for the tree we will divide here now 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.589
 a bunch of all the power and throw there firewood 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:06.900
 let it burn but 22 yes right and by the way 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.970
 saying this coal i will take myself 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.580
 I will come in handy then I will tell you nothing 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.939
 he will be needed so we mean here 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.970
 eat chicken breast we collect it was 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.790
 before that and for two logs for the night 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.740
 click on plays here and well, come on 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.140
 because he now distributes color 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:29.880
 then this 1 meter moment to us now 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:31.860
 need more precisely not necessary a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.000
 that we can still make fall light 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.799
 here we are at the very beginning of the game 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.900
 we can make a torch 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.509
 Now I have the torch is neither one nor the firewood 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.420
 there he is click on 2 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.060
 here and the form there went a report to you there 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.549
 there was a figure this is the initial 250 this 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.280
 the number of seconds of time we can 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.899
 1 torch himself hold this torch on 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.509
 actually has both pros and cons 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.330
 Its advantages are what we see when we 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:00.700
 we go 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.590
 We broadcast a hare and a way to a minus 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.270
 the torch is that he and us too 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.700
 far see when we run with this 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.300
 fact across the field and we attract so 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.580
 way 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.070
 other hungry don alive players 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.320
 which he sees in us is not ready novice 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.590
 I do not understand that the torch is very 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:21.700
 dangerous harmful thing so we him 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:24.930
 stew consequently when you want to for 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:28.210
 the night we get is a matter of survival 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:30.580
 not on the pvp server then the torch is very 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.050
 lulu when it comes to in-Priest 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.180
 the server is any extra light it only you 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:42.340
 strongly marks the battlefield and you 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.620
 know the mix of other players here 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.720
 so if you need to go monsters 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.790
 axes you thought that with light it 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.730
 there will be good opportunities if them if 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.810
 seen here and there, or that Monica 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.400
 get away from but if you don't have a sharp 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.610
 need to light here such here 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.739
 torch then do not do it need to stand 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.260
 I will recommend you there are other ways 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.800
 such as flashlights on the flashlight as well 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.680
 as here our torch has a property 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.550
 attract light chickpea to everyone 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.690
 shows that this is a light source 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:18.070
 therefore, we will not do this for 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.310
 order to make a flashlight is necessary 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:28.120
 when we turn it off get on her 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:31.330
 second drawing is also necessary 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.239
 need more difficult to find it 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:36.070
 mineral resource ok then now 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.260
 the question arises how they will do our 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:41.500
 torch 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.450
 look we find here in the menu red then 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:46.239
 we start it we call the button it was 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.890
 father 's default here is such 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:53.769
 item fought and from here we have this 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.090
 item like cake torch 2 on it to us 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.810
 show we need here three 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:04:01.230
 components of the low grade file 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:05.370
 here and cool in other words from like that 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:06.930
 new fuel wood and fabric we have 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.720
 the tree is the fabric of the coin not down to 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.090
 fuel okay look further right here 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.250
 there is only a knisa item but 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.320
 fuel that is not needed for this we need 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:22.350
 animal fat and tissue we make ourselves 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.210
 now we make one point it is done 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:26.480
 in just two seconds please 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.580
 such a thing this here is the fuel itself 

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:32.250
 back to the torch in the valley 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.200
 we just need one item each 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:37.229
 things we have u need ok 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.180
 crafting is done 10 seconds this time 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:42.260
 start some water here in this window 

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:46.169
 there will be another torch as I remember 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:48.720
 waiting waiting yes here he appeared and he 

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:53.130
 appeared on the spot fuel just yes that's it 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:55.860
 please run click on the number 6 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.580
 and he is now a new fayka us appeared 

00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.160
 caught fire 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:05.820
 so we were able to make fire for ourselves 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:07.860
 I did it, but for starters, I think 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.419
 something else we can continue the others 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.710
 videos about which I will continue to write 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:12.710
 Thank you for your attention happy
