00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.819
 Hello and welcome back his attitude he is already on the subject today 

00:00:18.819 --> 00:00:20.050
 shoulder joint 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.519
 In addition, steering is the most popular guided human body 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.349
 Gesine had different Greece 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.339
 and books home when the withdrawal Atiq National Museum Kabul »everything 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.450
 So the connection between SK polar and the humor 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.880
 the scapula 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.230
 until the most important part of the shoulder joint pulls on the Deutzer 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.020
 Side of the gate Arnason Platter bone 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.020
 it appeared prominence has the unequal Mainzer still break through 

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
 second part of the shoulder joint, head over is also more humor 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.039
 the with his upper arm head in the joints Faltus shoulder 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.330
 Space intervenes 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.050
 you can first of all the SGA Poularden 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.230
 there was or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:00:59.660
 consists 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:00.839
 "We are up 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.210
 and projections that allow anatomical orientation 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.020
 we see here on the Doors a side that gave or a hefty bone 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.580
 head Start 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.870
 around this Bienas Capone 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.580
 when Trier's life ends in op Romeo at the shoulder level 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.650
 There were two pits each below the finals 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.310
 Muscle origins are located 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.140
 on the one hand Dr. Zwiener gave it or in the so-called Foster Supra 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.009
 SPEEN Artur so located above the TuS Weener and below the Wieners gave 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.210
 or 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.540
 Vosser in the suit the adder 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 Trainers the whole time now on the van Triers side we also see one here 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.780
 pit 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.580
 In this case, then also to the rides Weisz that is the so-called 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.570
 Foster 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.500
 Suggs Capol different 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.789
 always this whole process each sit strong muscles 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.010
 which open to Mubarak yet Mindanao 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:55.400
 ahead of the shoulder blade 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.700
 adjacent we see the clear as Kolat 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.970
 the collarbone 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.040
 which also has a small joint here 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.020
 is connected with 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.340
 the scapula 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.020
 we also see here various bands trains the connection between piano 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.809
 color 

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:10.860
 and the 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.689
 Stabilize shoulder blade 

00:02:12.689 --> 00:02:16.819
 if you look at the upper cooking the humor US, we can also here some 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.619
 important anatomical structures differ first in the upper arm 

00:02:19.619 --> 00:02:20.179
 head 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:22.529
 and creates in the upper arm 

00:02:22.529 --> 00:02:26.999
 in the area of ​​the upper head Dan Knaf the strong bone protrusions 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:32.209
 here the so-called tuberculosis Marios from a large bone hump 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.079
 as an approach to muscle service 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.129
 then on the Wental side that tuberculosis - 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.809
 a little bone hacker 

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:42.849
 between these two tuberculosis 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.580
 A sol q-cells runs down a tear of Soul Kiss Inter Tuberculosis to the 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.189
 and represented here by this little one 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.239
 cord 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.349
 The "cinecittà si long biceps head is the one in this solo kiss in Tettau 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:56.229
 POLAR 

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:58.659
 Ines Schulte Blankenheim is running 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:01.840
 if the shoulder joint so view of the wine festival relatively few ban 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:04.799
 Structure present here unlike other joints 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.709
 Sasan predominantly guided muscles 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.419
 warm these muscles once again in the individual 

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.439
 there speaks on the so-called red tuna cuff 

00:03:13.439 --> 00:03:16.439
 why you treasure because these muscles are like a cuff 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:19.989
 the rehearsal room head 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:24.659
 These muscles are in particular Lermoos Kiss Animal's Minutes but by the SGA 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.380
 Polar tuberculosis zones 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.849
 Mariusz Suszko bank still nciht 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:29.879
 there 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:35.159
 below the finals gave or so located in the us coastal Fross Wien Artus 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:38.219
 flat about three hectares again full on Naumoski the here 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:41.139
 tuberculosis 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.189
 Marius his approach to him converged his fibers 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:50.079
 and per banister Dr the Bienas Capone then the Muskulus Supra SPEEN Arthur 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.229
 Keep that alcohol more then stop it again 

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.539
 Tuberculosis Marius Dishonored pulls it 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.919
 even the operator, there is still a fourth muscle 

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:06.350
 Dr Rother Toren's cuff is heard that is the musculus Suggs Capol but St 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.909
 the ladies at tuberculosis and 

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:10.370
 that around Russ 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.280
 Inserted together, these four muscle must go 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.739
 and, of course, you have to move that too 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.169
 they stabilize the shoulder joint 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:24.240
 if now here the US Customs Capol just pull off everything Stenger firmly 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.840
 the humerus 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.820
 he has no real pan but is in principle only a very small 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.850
 Flag on flyer the scapula is available in so-called Capitals 

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.229
 the shelves 

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:42.249
 the one not so big a surface Dirk Springob covered upper arm button 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:44.039
 the property almost 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:46.669
 the surface is slightly widened you can see this gray 

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:49.819
 Structures through a piece of fibrous cartilage around this 

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:51.499
 Cameroon 

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.949
 Lite and thereby extending the length of something called the Lohr 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.669
 we grunted again 

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:01.120
 Shoulder joint so a damn complicated constructed steered when 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.639
 that's why around the shoulder joint also has a lot of different degrees of freedom 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.839
 to allow for 

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:10.539
 In addition, a very many directions are actually immobile 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.939
 and of course it also gives the possibility to the poor 

00:05:12.939 --> 00:05:13.570
 directions 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:14.889
 she sang along 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.129
 I look here at Aachen lateral page 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:21.559
 you can see that the soft tissues are between bony structures 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.110
 but still have relatively little space 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.240
 and clinically for that 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.960
 then under certain conditions to a special in team-jumping syndrome 

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.460
 the right soft tissues pinch between them bones that may 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.569
 Pain 

00:05:34.569 --> 00:05:35.550
 shoulder joint 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.199
 cause yes that was a little overview 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:39.830
 on the topic of shoulder 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.530
 more about the shoulder joint and the anatomical involved 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.129
 They experience structures 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:46.409
 in the Dokic Dictionary
