all the mechanisms like on the side door

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.470 
all the mechanisms like on the side door
that<00:00:36.750> we<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.260> done<00:00:37.500> our<00:00:37.620> 3:45<00:00:38.550> model<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.360> be

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
that we have done our 3:45 model to be

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.970 
that we have done our 3:45 model to be
sure<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.870> everything<00:00:40.079> works<00:00:40.379> properly<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
sure that everything works properly and

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.860 
sure that everything works properly and
the<00:00:41.370> fit<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.700> finish<00:00:41.940> is<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.600> to<00:00:42.840> our

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
the fit and finish is up to our

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.959 
the fit and finish is up to our
standards<00:00:43.070> but<00:00:44.070> what<00:00:44.219> I<00:00:44.250> really<00:00:44.550> want<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.760> talk

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
standards but what I really want to talk

standards but what I really want to talk
about<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:46.110> our<00:00:47.039> running<00:00:47.340> surface<00:00:47.640> designs

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
about now is our running surface designs

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.740 
about now is our running surface designs
we<00:00:48.690> have<00:00:48.840> three<00:00:49.320> designs<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:50.910> are<00:00:51.329> unique<00:00:51.719> to

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
we have three designs that are unique to

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.840 
we have three designs that are unique to
Scout<00:00:52.079> those<00:00:52.320> the<00:00:52.829> first<00:00:53.100> one<00:00:53.309> which<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.579> what

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
Scout those the first one which is what

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.209 
Scout those the first one which is what
we<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.180> our<00:00:54.390> smaller<00:00:54.750> craft<00:00:55.050> from<00:00:55.559> 15<00:00:56.010> foot

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
we use in our smaller craft from 15 foot

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.779 
we use in our smaller craft from 15 foot
up<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.000> 19<00:00:57.360> foot<00:00:57.600> is<00:00:57.780> our<00:00:58.379> air<00:00:58.559> sisters<00:00:59.070> I'm<00:00:59.280> our

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
up to 19 foot is our air sisters I'm our

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.790 
up to 19 foot is our air sisters I'm our
air<00:01:00.000> sisters<00:01:00.539> ein<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> design<00:01:01.530> that<00:01:01.649> we

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
air sisters ein is a design that we

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
air sisters ein is a design that we
started<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.250> company<00:01:02.489> with<00:01:02.640> 20<00:01:03.449> years<00:01:03.660> ago

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
started the company with 20 years ago

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.980 
started the company with 20 years ago
and<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.739> very<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.250> unique<00:01:05.479> to<00:01:06.479> our<00:01:06.659> brand

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and it's very very unique to our brand

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.350 
and it's very very unique to our brand
and<00:01:07.320> then<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> creates<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.400> very<00:01:08.610> stable<00:01:09.000> boat

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
and then it creates a very stable boat

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.050 
and then it creates a very stable boat
it's<00:01:10.320> very<00:01:10.560> fuel<00:01:10.860> efficient<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.670> gets<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.030> a

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it's very fuel efficient it gets on a

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.149 
it's very fuel efficient it gets on a
plane<00:01:12.119> very<00:01:12.659> early<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.260> it<00:01:13.590> does<00:01:13.799> all<00:01:14.010> this

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
plane very early and it does all this

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.100 
plane very early and it does all this
with<00:01:14.340> less<00:01:14.520> horsepower<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:15.240> less<00:01:15.780> horsepower

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
with less horsepower and less horsepower

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.950 
with less horsepower and less horsepower
obviously<00:01:17.070> means<00:01:17.310> less<00:01:17.580> fuel<00:01:17.970> burn<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.689> it's<00:01:18.840> a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
obviously means less fuel burn so it's a

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.940 
obviously means less fuel burn so it's a
very<00:01:19.229> very<00:01:19.439> fuel<00:01:20.369> efficient<00:01:21.530> very<00:01:22.530> good

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
very very fuel efficient very good

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
very very fuel efficient very good
all-around<00:01:23.250> design<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:24.869> for<00:01:25.500> that

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530

sized<00:01:25.890> boat<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.490> you<00:01:27.210> get<00:01:27.450> larger<00:01:27.810> in<00:01:28.229> sizes

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
sized boat as you get larger in sizes

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.819 
sized boat as you get larger in sizes
you<00:01:29.460> can't<00:01:29.790> use<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.299> same<00:01:30.570> type<00:01:31.409> of<00:01:31.439> running

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you can't use the same type of running

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.190 
you can't use the same type of running
surface<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.490> isn't<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.270> one<00:01:33.450> size<00:01:33.479> fits<00:01:33.720> all

most of our competitors have a
particular<00:01:37.799> design<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.640> doesn't<00:01:39.060> change

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
particular design and it doesn't change

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.060 
particular design and it doesn't change
much<00:01:39.689> from<00:01:39.960> they're<00:01:40.500> smaller<00:01:40.799> to<00:01:41.040> larger

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
craft and what they're doing is they're

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.219 
craft and what they're doing is they're
