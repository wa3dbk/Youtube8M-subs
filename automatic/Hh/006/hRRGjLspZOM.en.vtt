working

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.280 
working
and<00:04:27.820> now<00:04:28.820> using<00:04:29.120> my<00:04:29.210> mirror<00:04:29.420> I'm<00:04:29.690> going<00:04:30.050> to

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
and now using my mirror I'm going to

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.640 
and now using my mirror I'm going to
apply<00:04:31.100> a<00:04:31.190> thin<00:04:31.610> line<00:04:31.790> just<00:04:32.660> right<00:04:33.200> next<00:04:33.350> to<00:04:33.530> my

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650

lashes

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:47.490 

so<00:04:45.009> as<00:04:45.250> you<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.550> see<00:04:45.759> one<00:04:46.090> is<00:04:46.449> done<00:04:46.720> it's<00:04:47.080> not<00:04:47.470> a

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
so as you can see one is done it's not a

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.350 
so as you can see one is done it's not a
thick<00:04:47.919> line<00:04:48.160> but<00:04:48.520> it's<00:04:48.639> just<00:04:48.849> enough<00:04:49.090> to<00:04:49.240> give

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
thick line but it's just enough to give

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.700 
thick line but it's just enough to give
