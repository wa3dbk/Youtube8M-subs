colored as as they can be but there are
things<00:00:35.460> in<00:00:35.700> this<00:00:35.820> food<00:00:36.059> that<00:00:36.300> do<00:00:36.570> help<00:00:36.780> them

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
things in this food that do help them

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.799 
things in this food that do help them
with<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.739> coloration<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:42.420> some<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
with that coloration and some of the

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.170 
with that coloration and some of the
ingredients<00:00:42.930> would<00:00:43.590> be<00:00:43.739> whole<00:00:44.070> salmon<00:00:44.399> black

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
ingredients would be whole salmon black

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.250 
ingredients would be whole salmon black
cod<00:00:45.649> seafood<00:00:46.649> mix<00:00:47.450> including<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.809> rockfish

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
cod seafood mix including the rockfish

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.450

and shrimp
so<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.000> first<00:00:51.780> ingredients<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.530> definitely

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
so the first ingredients are definitely

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.279 
so the first ingredients are definitely
key<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.370> any<00:00:53.520> fish<00:00:53.820> food<00:00:54.120> on<00:00:54.449> any<00:00:54.840> food<00:00:55.170> in

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
key to any fish food on any food in

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.470 
key to any fish food on any food in
general<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:55.739> because<00:00:56.280> that's<00:00:57.090> what<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
general just because that's what the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.170 
general just because that's what the
most<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:58.410> ingredient<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.399> that<00:01:00.000> goes

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
most of that ingredient is in that goes

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.779 
most of that ingredient is in that goes
by<00:01:00.329> quantities<00:01:00.870> of<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> ingredients<00:01:01.789> so

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
by quantities of the ingredients so

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.549 
by quantities of the ingredients so
pretty<00:01:03.390> much<00:01:03.539> what<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.780> see<00:01:03.809> first<00:01:04.229> is<00:01:04.379> what

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
pretty much what you see first is what

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.250 
pretty much what you see first is what
there<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.830> most<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.659> so<00:01:06.659> I<00:01:06.689> definitely<00:01:07.110> can't

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
there is most of so I definitely can't

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
there is most of so I definitely can't
complain<00:01:07.560> about<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.890> quality<00:01:08.400> of<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.520> food
