cranks<00:01:30.060> to<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.350> gears<00:01:31.650> so<00:01:32.009> that<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.250> would

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
cranks to the gears so that it would

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.219 
cranks to the gears so that it would
keep<00:01:32.520> time<00:01:32.820> which<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.360> not<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.810> easy<00:01:33.869> job

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
keep time which is not an easy job

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.289 
keep time which is not an easy job
because<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.770> means<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.310> know<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.790> trolls<00:01:36.090> had
