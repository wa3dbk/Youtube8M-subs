all<00:03:47.159> the<00:03:47.220> mysteries<00:03:47.549> right<00:03:47.699> away<00:03:47.879> they<00:03:48.090> could

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
all the mysteries right away they could

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.270 
all the mysteries right away they could
technically<00:03:48.810> do<00:03:49.049> that<00:03:49.259> we're<00:03:49.590> the<00:03:49.919> way<00:03:50.099> that

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
technically do that we're the way that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.099 
technically do that we're the way that
we're<00:03:50.400> shooting<00:03:50.790> it<00:03:50.909> is<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.329> like<00:03:51.629> even<00:03:51.989> with

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:52.109 
we're shooting it is is like even with

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:53.869 
we're shooting it is is like even with
still<00:03:52.470> frames<00:03:52.799> and<00:03:53.040> stuff<00:03:53.099> like<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.639> like

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
still frames and stuff like that like

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:55.879 
still frames and stuff like that like
you'd<00:03:54.060> have<00:03:54.239> to<00:03:54.419> you<00:03:54.780> did<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.259> density<00:03:55.799> and

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
you'd have to you did the density and

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.099 
you'd have to you did the density and
the<00:03:55.949> depth<00:03:56.250> of<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.519> tattoos<00:03:57.000> it's<00:03:57.299> like<00:03:57.449> I

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
the depth of the tattoos it's like I

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:00.559 
the depth of the tattoos it's like I
don't<00:03:58.560> think<00:03:58.859> like<00:03:58.979> even<00:03:59.009> HD<00:03:59.489> really<00:04:00.060> captures

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
don't think like even HD really captures

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.780 
don't think like even HD really captures
unless<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.049> like<00:04:01.169> very<00:04:01.379> close<00:04:01.739> to<00:04:01.919> it<00:04:02.069> and

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
unless you're like very close to it and

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.280 
unless you're like very close to it and
then<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.180> other<00:04:03.299> thing<00:04:03.479> too<00:04:03.689> is<00:04:03.720> like<00:04:03.989> a<00:04:04.049> lot

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
then the other thing too is like a lot

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.469 
then the other thing too is like a lot
of<00:04:04.409> the<00:04:04.500> tattoos<00:04:04.949> they<00:04:05.819> need<00:04:06.090> additional

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:06.479 
of the tattoos they need additional

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:08.659 
of the tattoos they need additional
information<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:07.349> comes<00:04:07.680> from<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.489> they're

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
information that comes from so they're

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.399 
information that comes from so they're
there<00:04:08.909> are<00:04:09.000> pieces<00:04:09.239> that<00:04:09.509> absolutely<00:04:10.019> you<00:04:10.169> can

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
there are pieces that absolutely you can

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.729 
there are pieces that absolutely you can
solve<00:04:10.680> like<00:04:10.949> the<00:04:11.069> second<00:04:11.489> tattoo<00:04:12.379> for<00:04:13.379> episode

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
solve like the second tattoo for episode

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.099 
solve like the second tattoo for episode
two<00:04:13.949> is<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.430> direct<00:04:14.939> correlation<00:04:15.359> to<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.870> first

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
two is a direct correlation to the first

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.110 
two is a direct correlation to the first
tattoo<00:04:16.530> like<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> one<00:04:17.009> that<00:04:17.190> so<00:04:17.609> there<00:04:17.970> is

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:18.120 
tattoo like the one that so there is

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:19.490 
tattoo like the one that so there is
some<00:04:18.389> stuff<00:04:18.630> in<00:04:18.750> there<00:04:18.840> that<00:04:18.900> you<00:04:19.139> can<00:04:19.289> figure

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
some stuff in there that you can figure

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.370 
some stuff in there that you can figure
out<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:20.370> as<00:04:20.909> the<00:04:21.180> show<00:04:21.359> progresses<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.289> know

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
out but as the show progresses you know

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.790 
out but as the show progresses you know
as<00:04:22.590> as

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
as as

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.890 
as as
happened<00:04:24.310> then<00:04:24.460> you<00:04:24.699> can<00:04:24.849> trace<00:04:25.120> back<00:04:25.419> to<00:04:25.690> her

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
happened then you can trace back to her

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.899 
happened then you can trace back to her
body<00:04:26.409> if<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.650> makes<00:04:27.069> any<00:04:27.220> sense<00:04:27.280> I<00:04:27.610> know<00:04:27.669> it's

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
body if that makes any sense I know it's

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.460 
body if that makes any sense I know it's
like<00:04:28.060> without<00:04:28.539> being<00:04:28.720> specific<00:04:28.930> it<00:04:29.319> just

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
like without being specific it just

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.619 
like without being specific it just
sounds<00:04:29.710> like<00:04:29.740> a<00:04:29.860> garbled<00:04:30.340> mess<00:04:30.580> but<00:04:30.879> basically

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
sounds like a garbled mess but basically

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:32.129 
sounds like a garbled mess but basically
yes

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:32.139 
yes

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.600 
yes
I<00:04:32.169> think<00:04:32.440> if<00:04:32.530> some<00:04:32.740> people<00:04:32.860> are<00:04:33.159> real<00:04:33.400> there's

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
I think if some people are real there's

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.950 
I think if some people are real there's
a<00:04:33.669> lot<00:04:33.909> of<00:04:34.000> stuff<00:04:34.210> hidden<00:04:34.360> in<00:04:34.539> there<00:04:34.750> and<00:04:34.900> I

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
a lot of stuff hidden in there and I

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.080 
a lot of stuff hidden in there and I
think<00:04:35.199> some<00:04:35.409> you<00:04:35.919> know<00:04:36.069> people<00:04:36.490> are<00:04:36.610> geniuses

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
think some you know people are geniuses

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.909 
think some you know people are geniuses
online<00:04:37.659> and<00:04:37.900> so<00:04:38.080> they're<00:04:38.440> gonna<00:04:38.560> figure<00:04:38.770> out

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:38.919 
online and so they're gonna figure out

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:41.219 
online and so they're gonna figure out
some<00:04:39.190> stuff<00:04:39.340> but<00:04:40.030> it<00:04:40.120> won't<00:04:40.330> I<00:04:40.569> don't<00:04:40.900> think<00:04:41.020> it

00:04:41.219 --> 00:04:41.229 
some stuff but it won't I don't think it

00:04:41.229 --> 00:04:44.189 
some stuff but it won't I don't think it
will<00:04:41.289> spoil<00:04:42.090> where<00:04:43.090> it's<00:04:43.240> going<00:04:43.629> they<00:04:43.780> are<00:04:43.930> all

00:04:44.189 --> 00:04:44.199 
will spoil where it's going they are all

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.200 
will spoil where it's going they are all
on<00:04:44.530> one<00:04:44.560> person<00:04:45.520> mm-hm
