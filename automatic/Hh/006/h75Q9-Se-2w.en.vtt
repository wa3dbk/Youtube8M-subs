of<00:02:04.259> reasons<00:02:04.619> why<00:02:04.920> people<00:02:05.580> are<00:02:05.790> able<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.030> do

of reasons why people are able to do
less<00:02:06.330> lessons<00:02:06.780> only<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.440> my<00:02:07.710> own<00:02:07.860> case<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.759> can

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
less lessons only in my own case I I can

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.360 
less lessons only in my own case I I can
only<00:02:09.569> do<00:02:09.899> kind<00:02:10.410> of<00:02:10.440> occasional<00:02:10.890> lessons<00:02:11.220> these

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370

Ian<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.580> YouTube<00:02:15.060> particularly<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.900> quite

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
Ian and YouTube particularly is quite

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.550 
Ian and YouTube particularly is quite
time<00:02:16.680> consuming<00:02:17.209> but<00:02:18.209> having<00:02:18.750> said<00:02:19.050> that<00:02:19.110> it's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
time consuming but having said that it's

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.800 
time consuming but having said that it's
actually<00:02:19.820> not<00:02:20.820> that<00:02:20.880> strenuous<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.660> I<00:02:21.750> do

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
actually not that strenuous and I do

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.590 
actually not that strenuous and I do
still<00:02:22.260> you<00:02:22.739> know<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:23.010> have<00:02:23.430> I<00:02:23.730> try<00:02:24.209> and<00:02:24.269> do<00:02:24.569> a

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
still you know I I have I try and do a

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.740 
still you know I I have I try and do a
certain<00:02:25.170> number<00:02:25.350> of<00:02:25.680> lessons<00:02:26.750> basically

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
certain number of lessons basically

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.430 
certain number of lessons basically
because<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.560> it<00:02:28.680> involves<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.519> a

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
because what it involves is a

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.290 
because what it involves is a
willingness<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.860> sit<00:02:32.250> down<00:02:32.430> in<00:02:32.640> impart

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
willingness to sit down in impart

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.210 
willingness to sit down in impart
knowledge<00:02:33.600> that<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.350> have<00:02:34.380> a<00:02:34.590> battle<00:02:34.980> attacks

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
knowledge that you have a battle attacks

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.160 
knowledge that you have a battle attacks
to<00:02:35.700> other<00:02:35.850> people<00:02:36.209> that<00:02:36.239> are<00:02:36.540> there<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.959> learn

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
to other people that are there to learn

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.050 
to other people that are there to learn
that<00:02:37.230> are<00:02:37.530> willing<00:02:37.739> to<00:02:38.069> learn<00:02:38.340> and<00:02:38.610> that's<00:02:38.940> the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
that are willing to learn and that's the

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.340 
that are willing to learn and that's the
core<00:02:39.239> of<00:02:39.269> Sgt<00:02:39.750> everybody<00:02:40.319> is<00:02:40.560> there<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.459> learn

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
core of Sgt everybody is there to learn

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.690 
core of Sgt everybody is there to learn
if<00:02:42.710> you're<00:02:42.860> going<00:02:42.980> into<00:02:43.130> it<00:02:43.370> with<00:02:43.400> that

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
if you're going into it with that

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.600 
if you're going into it with that
mindset<00:02:44.090> then<00:02:44.570> that's<00:02:45.470> going<00:02:45.680> to<00:02:45.770> be<00:02:45.860> a<00:02:45.890> good

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
mindset then that's going to be a good

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.910 
mindset then that's going to be a good
thing<00:02:46.820> for<00:02:46.880> both<00:02:47.150> students<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.260> instructors

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
thing for both students and instructors

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.600 
thing for both students and instructors
so<00:02:49.820> what<00:02:50.300> does<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.450> actually<00:02:50.660> involve<00:02:51.620> well

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
so what does it actually involve well

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.880 
so what does it actually involve well
from<00:02:53.330> my<00:02:53.480> own<00:02:53.600> experience<00:02:54.050> I<00:02:54.140> can<00:02:54.350> say<00:02:54.590> it's

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
from my own experience I can say it's

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.180 
from my own experience I can say it's
actually<00:02:55.460> it's<00:02:56.270> not<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:56.960> difficult<00:02:57.710> you

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
actually it's not that difficult you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:01.360 
actually it's not that difficult you
don't<00:02:58.460> have<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.620> massively<00:03:00.620> knowledgeable

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
don't have to be massively knowledgeable

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.700 
don't have to be massively knowledgeable
about<00:03:01.730> every<00:03:02.300> single<00:03:02.690> aspect<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:03.320> World<00:03:03.590> of

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
about every single aspect of World of

about every single aspect of World of
Tanks<00:03:03.860> that's<00:03:04.190> not<00:03:04.430> how<00:03:04.580> s<00:03:04.790> GTA<00:03:05.150> works<00:03:05.540> we

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
Tanks that's not how s GTA works we

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.800 
Tanks that's not how s GTA works we
basically<00:03:06.260> have<00:03:06.500> instructors<00:03:07.130> for<00:03:07.810> different
