00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.960
 we are back in ours 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.990
 while garden in the center 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:20.510
 have a month ago we worked with the 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.170
 land that was unkempt before and now 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.300
 after the rain and sun the snow and the 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.369
 other atmospheric agents have worked 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.009
 we are ready for the earth 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:33.200
 to prepare the ground for later 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.110
 sow or transplant the seedlings 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.079
 of the vegetable garden first 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.020
 we create the walkways the walkways 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.270
 are needed 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.420
 was 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.820
 to help orc even when there 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.730
 they are prolonged rains which happens 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.130
 quite often when we start 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.020
 arrive towards the end of the season but 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.500
 even at the beginning of the season 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.160
 May our walkways are 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.050
 consisting of sturdy wooden boards 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.890
 each of which is 25 wide 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.250
 centimeters 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.729
 and then by 2 side by side we will get gods 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:14.670
 50 cm walkways 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.300
 being very robust, it is sufficient 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.970
 place them on the newly freed land 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.810
 from any stones or stones that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:26.910
 they remained inside 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 just the weight of those who will then walk by 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:36.390
 make them stay in their place without anyone 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.740
 problem that they move before 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.020
 support the events 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.930
 you have to remove all the stones and the 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.509
 stones that are present in the soil yes 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.660
 remove with a sturdy rake 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.880
 in order to get only list land 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.189
 on which to rest the skin 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 and so they will stand still and not yes 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.640
 move 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.060
 now we are paying the land for 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.149
 eliminate as much stones as possible e 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.330
 stones that are absolutely 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.150
 not recommended for vegetable plants 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:17.860
 we use a spade and of course 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:20.510
 let's proceed backwards when you do 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.310
 they move the clods of earth 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:33.500
 we must avoid walking on it 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:36.590
 if you rent again we will be able to meet again during 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:39.950
 we realized that this process 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.090
 earth is rich in earthworms earthworms 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.819
 they are very useful organisms for that 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.799
 they move the earth and improve it perhaps 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:52.280
 in the end this land is not so bad 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.470
 how we would have thought and then guaranteed 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.500
 good success at our seedlings from 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.500
 vegetable garden 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:10.400
 at this point after wetting the 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 ground we pass to the last working 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:18.470
 transplant it is to rake for 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.630
 well every single parcel so as to 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.000
 break the processing sole from 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.210
 remove the last stones and the last ones 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.720
 stones left and to be made the most 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:33.210
 possible flat land e 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.840
 welcoming for sowing or transplanting 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:35.840
 of the seedlings 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.270
 now our garden is ready we have 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:46.940
 we have all the walkways laid out 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:49.800
 wandered the flowerbeds we raked 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.380
 every single parcel and we have 

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.220
 delimited all the vegetable garden with the blocks 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.680
 of tuff 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.490
 we are ready to sow or to 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.490
 transplant
