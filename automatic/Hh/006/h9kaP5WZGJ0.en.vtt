00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.060
 291 is so today we find ourselves 

00:00:16.359 --> 00:00:21.340
 for a video a bit special because 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.859
 it will not be like end will be a video 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 on cash flow as usual it will be 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.170
 rather a video about how to change his 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.309
 mass bagnères I do not know too much 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.090
 what is it called savagnières 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.980
 youtube actually because there is someone 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.410
 who asked me about a comment under 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:41.020
 sailors on my first video how 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.670
 change the profile picture and therefore not 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.510
 I showed you so it's a lot 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.989
 simpler than his photo gesture 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.300
 profile followed by so go on 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 Internet 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:59.890
 so here and go on youtube 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:04.000
 so you go on youtube you go 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.340
 on your youtube channel as if you 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 finally click you touch your 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.950
 banner like that and so up there at 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.920
 right 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.290
 you're going to have a little pencil 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.479
 cold that will appear 

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.600
 so you just have to click on that 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:24.189
 pencil and have the illustration modified 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:27.310
 of the chain so that's going to charge a 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:29.079
 little and so there you just have to click 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.210
 selected photos on your 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.500
 computer 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.020
 eagle go to offer you to take 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.130
 a photo or go in your 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.369
 photo library so you go into the 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.590
 photo library and so there you 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:49.390
 choose a photo so I 'm in 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:51.040
 skirt make the same so I do not know what 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.480
 I'm getting 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:59.920
 not sure in my film she has 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:02.410
 so once she's cut that 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.760
 is going to be imported so there you 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:09.369
 see that the recommended size is 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:13.360
 2560 x 1440 and maximum size of mo 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:15.340
 so two months ago the mayor photo on 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.860
 photoshop so I took the good 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.130
 measures including his pass so here is 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.840
 he will show you the different low 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:25.750
 the differences so preview on 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.810
 computer because that's going to render on 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.130
 television and mobile 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:35.650
 so here's after you can always re 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.970
 frame your your your text finally by 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.870
 example it's a text when your 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.220
 banner that's it and then just 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.050
 to his readings and I had the 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.300
 milk because it's useless that I 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.090
 put the same way there and advise 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.800
 Normally your banner will be changed 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.510
 here I hope that this tutorial will have you 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:57.100
 helped the ag release more videos than 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.010
 before because this is the holidays 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.989

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.310

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.920
 every two days 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.450
 so here on this put a comment 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.019
