00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.789
 Michael I do not know where the effect 

00:00:10.789 --> 00:00:12.210
 where and why

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.810
 Aarau 

00:02:12.509 --> 00:02:15.599

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.599
 MR 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:23.409
 and so on 

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:27.560
 you should not mind eating here with Meniar so more foods 

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:29.009
 would be ignored 

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.009
 no matter that I think it is again 

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:34.539
 because I myself 4 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:37.539
 Month 2 about 2 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.999
 BCGI Bahtiyar Monterrey

 the name says a low debt says 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.459
 the first question she asks is why I want to sell him 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.099
 on the one hand, of course, the same as in the last auction 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.659
 finally has some more of this hustle and bustle 2 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:57.629
 Jugene life 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:01.430
 that would be to stand then and here I bleed a bit 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.579
 the heart because this is not one of those where I want to be for this one plays 

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:05.849
 never, anyway 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.859
 but percent of love I actually hot and heartfelt 

00:04:08.859 --> 00:04:10.880
 but the Kirchweih this 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.179
 So the danger makes me ready 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.430
 that's not that bad, "reminds a bit of a door 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:17.819
 in Brussels 

00:04:17.819 --> 00:04:21.019
 just to be natural that with the left over may therefore be the latest 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.019
 Whisper it's a damn 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:26.800
 the lawyers 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.560
 If the IG also wants to be our client, it was the same with you as a player 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.830
 can look like 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.689
 It's not that bad either. It's just different from what it says on a large scale 

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.029
 all you can say 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:39.710
 there but her choice 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.830
 and market said Thiessen sound is Isilon Alberto deeper what is called here Feng 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.419
 practically that the arena and so on 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:50.389
 So everything has to play a little bit higher, which is not really the case 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.389
 bad is only 4 euros 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:57.770
 Commander BAG accustomed us and certain things like La Rocca for example or 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.639
 What else, where else, son of Philipp LÃ¶hles? 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:03.589
 I'm not going to go that way anymore - I'm now climbing this market 

00:05:03.589 --> 00:05:07.379
 and successful in German but also only plays because some opportunities 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.930
 and from the number I can not get out or contradict the riding 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:14.930
 and again Monfils Webber does not work for me 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:18.889
 and so that they are virtually zero and so slow by percent 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.909
 playing worn pieces is just too bad that hominids 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.850
 because so 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.780
 to the point the good piece were built model for the youth steel Lyon 

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.439
 Cheong Julio Cesar a praise 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:33.869

 the woman 

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:50.330
 Euro come together, but I think that one gives someone where to 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.020
 stands 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.419
 at that time, exactly 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:55.469
 as they reverse these bastards partners via YouTube 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:05:57.400
 that's all again 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.400
 reasonable 

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.900
 how can Thomsen Thumann sometimes get done?
