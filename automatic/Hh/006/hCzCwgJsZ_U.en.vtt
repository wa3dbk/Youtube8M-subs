and guys like I said what's neat about
this<00:06:35.810> game<00:06:36.110> is<00:06:36.439> not<00:06:36.860> only<00:06:37.509> that<00:06:38.509> you're<00:06:38.689> not

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:38.870 
this game is not only that you're not

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.869 
this game is not only that you're not
out<00:06:39.139> of<00:06:39.439> the<00:06:39.560> game<00:06:39.800> and<00:06:40.099> then<00:06:40.250> you<00:06:40.400> just<00:06:40.669> have

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:40.879 
out of the game and then you just have

00:06:40.879 --> 00:06:44.290 
out of the game and then you just have
to<00:06:41.060> watch<00:06:41.360> everybody<00:06:42.009> you<00:06:43.009> just<00:06:43.279> keep<00:06:43.610> on<00:06:43.849> play

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:44.300 
to watch everybody you just keep on play

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.019 
to watch everybody you just keep on play
until<00:06:44.719> the<00:06:44.779> very<00:06:45.500> end<00:06:45.680> and<00:06:46.370> try<00:06:46.580> to<00:06:46.639> get<00:06:46.879> back

00:06:47.019 --> 00:06:47.029 
until the very end and try to get back

00:06:47.029 --> 00:06:49.779 
until the very end and try to get back
on<00:06:47.089> and<00:06:47.750> then<00:06:48.409> when<00:06:48.589> this<00:06:48.740> game<00:06:48.979> is<00:06:49.039> over

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:49.789 
on and then when this game is over

00:06:49.789 --> 00:06:52.329 
on and then when this game is over
the<00:06:50.060> next<00:06:50.389> one<00:06:50.539> begins<00:06:50.750> so<00:06:51.649> there's<00:06:51.949> no

00:06:52.329 --> 00:06:52.339 
the next one begins so there's no

00:06:52.339 --> 00:06:55.779 
the next one begins so there's no
downtime<00:06:53.080> where<00:06:54.080> you<00:06:54.349> don't<00:06:54.740> get<00:06:55.009> to<00:06:55.189> play<00:06:55.460> and

00:06:55.779 --> 00:06:55.789 
downtime where you don't get to play and

00:06:55.789 --> 00:06:59.170 
downtime where you don't get to play and
I<00:06:56.330> think<00:06:56.360> that<00:06:56.870> makes<00:06:57.110> it<00:06:57.289> so<00:06:57.770> much<00:06:57.949> fun<00:06:58.180> for

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
I think that makes it so much fun for

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.829 
I think that makes it so much fun for
little<00:06:59.509> ones<00:06:59.719> that<00:06:59.899> don't<00:07:00.409> want<00:07:00.740> to<00:07:00.949> get<00:07:01.159> out

00:07:01.829 --> 00:07:01.839 
little ones that don't want to get out

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:08.499 
little ones that don't want to get out
so<00:07:02.839> this<00:07:03.259> game<00:07:03.909> without<00:07:04.909> a<00:07:05.180> doubt<00:07:06.939> gets<00:07:07.939> two

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509 
so this game without a doubt gets two

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:13.119 
so this game without a doubt gets two
