memorize and make sure that the student
learns<00:00:33.370> all<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:34.510> different<00:00:34.930> movements

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
learns all the different movements

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.280 
learns all the different movements
within<00:00:35.740> the<00:00:35.950> window<00:00:36.280> system<00:00:36.700> but<00:00:37.390> later<00:00:37.660> you

showing today 7 section is one you could

00:01:25.749 --> 00:01:28.709 
showing today 7 section is one you could
call<00:01:25.990> like<00:01:26.200> an<00:01:26.759> application<00:01:27.759> why<00:01:27.999> section<00:01:28.600> in

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:28.719 
call like an application why section in

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:32.989 
call like an application why section in
one<00:01:29.409> section<00:01:30.189> that<00:01:30.969> is<00:01:31.149> more<00:01:31.509> like<00:01:31.869> a<00:01:32.590> power

00:01:32.989 --> 00:01:32.999 
one section that is more like a power

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:38.039 
one section that is more like a power
training<00:01:34.469> section<00:01:36.389> for<00:01:37.389> the<00:01:37.479> people<00:01:37.840> out

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
training section for the people out

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:42.660 
training section for the people out
there<00:01:38.499> that<00:01:39.399> going<00:01:40.299> to<00:01:40.509> buy<00:01:40.869> also<00:01:41.399> later<00:01:42.399> on

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
there that going to buy also later on

there that going to buy also later on
the<00:01:42.819> tongue<00:01:43.060> equation<00:01:43.810> DVDs<00:01:44.350> because<00:01:45.310> I'm

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
the tongue equation DVDs because I'm

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.239 
the tongue equation DVDs because I'm
going<00:01:45.819> to<00:01:45.939> release<00:01:46.270> a<00:01:46.479> few<00:01:46.929> DVDs<00:01:47.740> on<00:01:47.950> the<00:01:48.039> tank

00:01:48.239 --> 00:01:48.249 
going to release a few DVDs on the tank

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:50.789 
going to release a few DVDs on the tank
equation<00:01:48.789> system<00:01:49.270> they're<00:01:50.170> going<00:01:50.380> to<00:01:50.499> see

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
equation system they're going to see

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.440 
equation system they're going to see
very<00:01:51.639> much<00:01:51.819> similarity<00:01:52.590> with<00:01:54.179> the<00:01:55.179> first

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
very much similarity with the first

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.099 
very much similarity with the first
section<00:01:55.749> of<00:01:56.139> the<00:01:56.979> venture<00:01:57.490> including<00:01:58.109> form

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
section of the venture including form

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:01.739 
section of the venture including form
and<00:01:59.350> that's<00:02:00.039> because<00:02:00.280> this<00:02:01.030> section<00:02:01.569> what

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
and that's because this section what

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:03.539 
and that's because this section what
you're<00:02:01.869> going<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.109> see<00:02:02.259> now<00:02:02.439> is<00:02:02.679> one<00:02:03.280> of<00:02:03.429> the

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
you're going to see now is one of the

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.120 
you're going to see now is one of the
things<00:02:03.880> the<00:02:04.329> lake<00:02:04.539> chrome<00:02:05.109> asleep<00:02:05.560> month<00:02:05.829> took

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
things the lake chrome asleep month took

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.919 
things the lake chrome asleep month took
away<00:02:06.490> from<00:02:06.549> tie<00:02:07.270> that<00:02:07.329> line<00:02:07.689> and<00:02:07.920> probably

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
away from tie that line and probably

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.070 
away from tie that line and probably
yeah<00:02:12.569> saw<00:02:13.569> it<00:02:13.780> there<00:02:14.140> or<00:02:14.410> trained<00:02:15.069> it<00:02:15.250> there

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
yeah saw it there or trained it there

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.310 
yeah saw it there or trained it there
from<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.470> people<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:17.720> Grand<00:02:18.720> Master<00:02:19.110> tan

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320

was<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> last<00:02:39.540> student<00:02:39.930> of<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:41.240> lake<00:02:42.240> from

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
was the last student of the lake from

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.700 
was the last student of the lake from
marcg<00:02:42.900> month<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:43.950> probably<00:02:44.640> he<00:02:44.730> received<00:02:45.710> most

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:46.710 
marcg month so probably he received most

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.650 
marcg month so probably he received most
of<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.010> knowledge<00:02:47.370> from<00:02:47.640> the<00:02:47.880> period<00:02:48.420> i

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
of the knowledge from the period i

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.990 
of the knowledge from the period i
decline<00:02:49.160> another<00:02:50.160> thing<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.730> make<00:02:50.910> clear

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
decline another thing up to make clear

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
lineages in the hip my lineage what I

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.160 
lineages in the hip my lineage what I
can<00:03:15.959> show<00:03:16.200> is<00:03:16.470> the<00:03:16.620> learning<00:03:16.770> system<00:03:17.430> and

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
can show is the learning system and

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.990 
can show is the learning system and
another<00:03:19.170> thing<00:03:19.440> is<00:03:19.620> that's<00:03:20.250> not<00:03:20.580> what<00:03:20.880> I'm

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
another thing is that's not what I'm

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.210 
another thing is that's not what I'm

monitoring<00:03:40.410> system<00:03:40.769> so<00:03:41.250> yeah<00:03:41.610> cut<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.510> out

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.800 
monitoring system so yeah cut that out
of<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.050> way<00:03:43.080> let's<00:03:43.230> start
