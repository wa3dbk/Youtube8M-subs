00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.419 

okay<00:00:00.840> so<00:00:00.900> in<00:00:01.140> this<00:00:01.290> lesson<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:02.280> going<00:00:02.310> to

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
okay so in this lesson we're going to

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.680 
okay so in this lesson we're going to
learn<00:00:02.520> how<00:00:02.669> to<00:00:02.850> factor<00:00:03.449> a<00:00:03.480> whole<00:00:04.230> number<00:00:04.770> so

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:05.690 
learn how to factor a whole number so

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:08.059 
learn how to factor a whole number so
let's<00:00:06.690> start<00:00:06.990> out<00:00:07.080> by<00:00:07.109> talking<00:00:07.680> about<00:00:07.890> the

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
let's start out by talking about the

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.000 
let's start out by talking about the
difference<00:00:08.519> between<00:00:08.580> a<00:00:08.880> prime<00:00:09.420> number<00:00:09.450> and<00:00:10.230> a

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010 
difference between a prime number and a

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.610 
difference between a prime number and a
composite<00:00:11.910> number<00:00:11.960> okay<00:00:12.960> so<00:00:13.019> some<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.380> you

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
composite number okay so some of you

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.039 
composite number okay so some of you
know<00:00:13.799> what<00:00:13.950> a<00:00:13.980> prime<00:00:14.250> number<00:00:14.280> is<00:00:14.790> already<00:00:15.269> but

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
know what a prime number is already but

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.750 
know what a prime number is already but
others<00:00:16.379> will<00:00:16.560> not<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.070> let's<00:00:17.279> go<00:00:17.430> over<00:00:17.460> that

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
others will not so let's go over that

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.349 
others will not so let's go over that
definition<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.230> a<00:00:19.260> prime<00:00:19.800> number<00:00:19.830> is<00:00:20.580> a<00:00:20.850> whole

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
definition so a prime number is a whole

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.050 
definition so a prime number is a whole
number<00:00:22.220> remember<00:00:23.220> what<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.550> whole<00:00:23.730> numbers

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
number remember what the whole numbers

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.310 
number remember what the whole numbers
are<00:00:24.240> right<00:00:24.480> you<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.779> 0<00:00:25.230> 1<00:00:25.800> 2<00:00:26.400> 3<00:00:26.820> 4<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:28.199> know

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
are right you have 0 1 2 3 4 you know

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.929 
are right you have 0 1 2 3 4 you know
increasing<00:00:29.010> in<00:00:29.099> increments<00:00:29.310> of<00:00:29.519> 1<00:00:29.789> out

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
increasing in increments of 1 out

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.650 
increasing in increments of 1 out
indefinitely<00:00:30.410> okay<00:00:31.410> so<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> whole<00:00:32.009> number<00:00:32.660> that

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
indefinitely okay so a whole number that

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
indefinitely okay so a whole number that
is<00:00:34.110> larger<00:00:34.739> than<00:00:34.890> 1<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.020> is<00:00:37.020> only<00:00:37.530> divisible

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
is larger than 1 and is only divisible

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.869 
is larger than 1 and is only divisible
by<00:00:38.610> itself<00:00:39.270> or<00:00:39.570> one<00:00:39.870> ok<00:00:40.800> so<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.219> any<00:00:41.489> whole

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
by itself or one ok so it's any whole

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.270 
by itself or one ok so it's any whole
number<00:00:41.910> larger<00:00:42.570> than<00:00:42.780> 1<00:00:43.170> that<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.829> only

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
number larger than 1 that is only

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.869 
number larger than 1 that is only
divisible<00:00:44.820> by<00:00:45.149> itself<00:00:45.719> or<00:00:46.020> one<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.520> let's<00:00:47.700> take

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
divisible by itself or one so let's take

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.850 
divisible by itself or one so let's take
a<00:00:47.910> look<00:00:48.239> at<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:50.730> first<00:00:51.059> few<00:00:51.239> primes<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.989> we

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
a look at the first few primes here we

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:01.220 
a look at the first few primes here we
have<00:00:53.039> 2<00:00:53.430> 3<00:00:54.420> 5<00:00:55.280> 7<00:00:56.280> 11<00:00:56.640> 13<00:00:57.390> 17<00:00:58.140> 19<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.940> 23<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:01.020> and

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
have 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 and 23 here and

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.090 
have 2 3 5 7 11 13 17 19 and 23 here and
then<00:01:01.980> 23<00:01:02.340> is<00:01:02.640> not<00:01:02.820> our<00:01:03.120> last<00:01:03.420> prime<00:01:04.170> number<00:01:04.769> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
then 23 is not our last prime number so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.700 
then 23 is not our last prime number so
after<00:01:05.250> 23<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.630> next<00:01:06.930> prime<00:01:07.140> number<00:01:07.170> would<00:01:07.680> be

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
after 23 the next prime number would be

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.140 
after 23 the next prime number would be
29<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.760> then<00:01:09.180> 31<00:01:10.400> there<00:01:11.400> are<00:01:11.520> an<00:01:11.580> infinite

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
29 and then 31 there are an infinite

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.469 
29 and then 31 there are an infinite
number<00:01:12.180> of<00:01:12.600> prime<00:01:13.020> numbers<00:01:13.049> okay<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.040> after<00:01:14.909> 31

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
number of prime numbers okay so after 31

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.249 
number of prime numbers okay so after 31
there's<00:01:16.159> 37<00:01:17.159> okay<00:01:17.820> so<00:01:17.880> you<00:01:18.390> can<00:01:18.570> continue<00:01:18.869> on

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
there's 37 okay so you can continue on

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.499 
there's 37 okay so you can continue on
forever<00:01:19.530> never<00:01:19.920> it's<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:21.000> important<00:01:21.450> at

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
forever never it's just important at

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.270 
forever never it's just important at
this<00:01:21.630> point<00:01:21.720> to<00:01:21.960> realize<00:01:22.409> what<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> prime

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
this point to realize what a prime

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.609 
this point to realize what a prime
number<00:01:23.310> is<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.259> know<00:01:25.409> that

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
number is because we need to know that

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.249 
number is because we need to know that
when<00:01:25.860> we<00:01:25.950> start<00:01:26.189> factoring<00:01:26.430> whole<00:01:26.790> numbers

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
when we start factoring whole numbers

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.810 
when we start factoring whole numbers
now<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.290> have<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.530> special<00:01:28.829> little<00:01:29.009> point<00:01:29.460> here

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
now I have a special little point here

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.850 
now I have a special little point here
that<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:30.119> need<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.390> remember<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.650> that

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
that you need to remember and it's that

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.660 
that you need to remember and it's that
too<00:01:32.280> is<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.000> only<00:01:33.210> prime<00:01:34.170> number<00:01:34.860> that<00:01:35.490> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
too is the only prime number that is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.410 
too is the only prime number that is
even<00:01:36.170> okay<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.400> only<00:01:38.579> prime<00:01:39.000> number

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
even okay to is the only prime number

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.359 
even okay to is the only prime number
that<00:01:39.570> is<00:01:39.720> even<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.740> why<00:01:40.920> is<00:01:40.979> that<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.220> case

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that is even and why is that the case

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.460 
that is even and why is that the case
well<00:01:42.270> if<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.450> watch<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.899> lesson<00:01:43.259> with<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
well if you watch the lesson with the

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.340 
well if you watch the lesson with the
visibility<00:01:44.070> rules<00:01:44.310> you<00:01:45.030> know<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.420> any<00:01:45.780> even

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
visibility rules you know that any even

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.060 
visibility rules you know that any even
number<00:01:46.729> that<00:01:47.729> is<00:01:47.939> larger<00:01:48.509> than<00:01:48.630> to

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
number that is larger than to

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.910 
number that is larger than to
automatically<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.310> divisible<00:01:50.640> by<00:01:50.909> 2<00:01:51.320> okay<00:01:52.320> so

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
automatically be divisible by 2 okay so

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.389 
automatically be divisible by 2 okay so
it<00:01:53.070> cannot<00:01:53.640> be<00:01:53.939> a<00:01:54.149> prime<00:01:54.509> number<00:01:55.280> all<00:01:56.280> right

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
it cannot be a prime number all right

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.179 
it cannot be a prime number all right
now<00:01:56.610> alternatively<00:01:57.680> anything<00:01:58.680> that's<00:01:58.890> not<00:01:59.130> a

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
now alternatively anything that's not a

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
now alternatively anything that's not a
prime<00:01:59.640> number<00:01:59.719> but<00:02:00.719> we're<00:02:00.869> talking<00:02:00.960> about

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
prime number but we're talking about

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.920 
prime number but we're talking about
whole<00:02:01.469> numbers<00:02:01.890> will<00:02:02.579> be<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.969> composite<00:02:03.899> number

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
whole numbers will be a composite number

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.830 
whole numbers will be a composite number
okay<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> composite<00:02:05.700> number<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.180> this<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.630> a

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
okay a composite number and this is a

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.830 
okay a composite number and this is a
whole<00:02:07.229> number<00:02:07.560> that<00:02:08.280> is<00:02:08.459> larger<00:02:09.000> than<00:02:09.119> 1<00:02:09.479> and

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
whole number that is larger than 1 and

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.460 
whole number that is larger than 1 and
is<00:02:10.110> divisible<00:02:10.500> by<00:02:10.800> some<00:02:11.340> number

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
is divisible by some number

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.300 
is divisible by some number
other<00:02:12.680> than<00:02:12.830> itself<00:02:13.220> or<00:02:13.610> one<00:02:14.710> okay<00:02:15.710> so<00:02:15.770> when<00:02:16.220> we

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
other than itself or one okay so when we

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.460 
other than itself or one okay so when we
talk<00:02:16.460> about<00:02:16.490> whole<00:02:16.910> numbers<00:02:17.420> they're<00:02:18.290> either

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
talk about whole numbers they're either

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.950 
talk about whole numbers they're either
going<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.800> be<00:02:19.040> a<00:02:19.280> prime<00:02:19.670> number<00:02:19.700> or<00:02:20.690> they're

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
going to be a prime number or they're

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.720 
going to be a prime number or they're
going<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:21.110> be<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.230> composite<00:02:21.800> number<00:02:21.830> ok<00:02:22.520> just

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
going to be a composite number ok just

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.030 
going to be a composite number ok just
don't<00:02:22.850> worry<00:02:23.060> about<00:02:23.240> 0<00:02:23.540> or<00:02:23.780> 1<00:02:24.020> okay<00:02:24.620> we're

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
don't worry about 0 or 1 okay we're

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.380 
don't worry about 0 or 1 okay we're
talking<00:02:25.130> about<00:02:25.370> whole<00:02:25.640> numbers<00:02:26.030> that<00:02:26.240> are

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
talking about whole numbers that are

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.660 
talking about whole numbers that are
larger<00:02:27.230> than<00:02:27.260> 1<00:02:27.530> so<00:02:27.710> starting<00:02:28.070> at<00:02:28.190> two<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
larger than 1 so starting at two and

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.080 
larger than 1 so starting at two and
moving<00:02:29.420> upwards<00:02:29.780> okay<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:30.950> anything<00:02:31.670> to<00:02:31.940> or

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
moving upwards okay so anything to or

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.580 
moving upwards okay so anything to or
larger<00:02:32.300> is<00:02:32.690> either<00:02:32.840> going<00:02:33.050> to<00:02:33.110> be<00:02:33.170> a<00:02:33.260> prime

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
larger is either going to be a prime

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.100 
larger is either going to be a prime
number<00:02:33.670> or<00:02:34.670> composite<00:02:35.030> number<00:02:35.540> okay<00:02:35.870> and

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
number or composite number okay and

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.540 
number or composite number okay and
again<00:02:36.290> we're<00:02:36.590> talking<00:02:36.620> about<00:02:36.980> just<00:02:37.160> whole

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
again we're talking about just whole

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.220 
again we're talking about just whole
numbers<00:02:37.970> either<00:02:38.120> okay<00:02:38.690> we're<00:02:38.840> not<00:02:38.900> talking

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
numbers either okay we're not talking

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.290 
numbers either okay we're not talking
about<00:02:39.700> anything<00:02:40.700> else<00:02:41.290> all<00:02:42.290> right<00:02:42.470> so<00:02:43.120> we<00:02:44.120> have

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:44.300 
about anything else all right so we have

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.210 
about anything else all right so we have
our<00:02:44.330> definitions<00:02:45.050> down<00:02:45.320> let's<00:02:45.860> look<00:02:46.040> at<00:02:46.190> a

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
our definitions down let's look at a

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.760 
our definitions down let's look at a
quick<00:02:46.459> example<00:02:46.660> and<00:02:48.730> we'll<00:02:49.730> see<00:02:50.030> if<00:02:50.180> we<00:02:50.770> can

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
quick example and we'll see if we can

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:54.010 
quick example and we'll see if we can
test<00:02:51.950> our<00:02:52.100> knowledge<00:02:52.280> here<00:02:52.750> all<00:02:53.750> right<00:02:53.900> for

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
test our knowledge here all right for

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.870 
test our knowledge here all right for
our<00:02:54.080> first<00:02:54.350> example<00:02:54.530> the<00:02:55.190> objective<00:02:55.670> is<00:02:55.730> to

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
our first example the objective is to

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.750 
our first example the objective is to
identify<00:02:56.000> each<00:02:56.630> as<00:02:56.900> prime<00:02:57.580> composite<00:02:58.580> or

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
identify each as prime composite or

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.740 
identify each as prime composite or
neither<00:03:00.310> all<00:03:01.310> right<00:03:01.459> so<00:03:01.640> for<00:03:01.820> part<00:03:02.060> one<00:03:02.360> here

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
neither all right so for part one here

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.580 
neither all right so for part one here
we<00:03:02.959> have<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.200> number<00:03:03.500> 19<00:03:04.270> so<00:03:05.270> is<00:03:05.480> 19<00:03:06.020> divisible

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
we have the number 19 so is 19 divisible

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.610 
we have the number 19 so is 19 divisible
by<00:03:06.650> anything<00:03:07.520> other<00:03:07.730> than<00:03:08.150> 19<00:03:09.080> which<00:03:09.380> would<00:03:09.500> be

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
by anything other than 19 which would be

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.390 
by anything other than 19 which would be
itself<00:03:09.950> or<00:03:10.310> one<00:03:11.860> well<00:03:12.860> think<00:03:13.070> back<00:03:13.190> through

itself or one well think back through

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.550 
itself or one well think back through
your<00:03:13.459> divisibility<00:03:13.940> rules<00:03:14.380> 19<00:03:15.380> is<00:03:15.440> not

or<00:03:33.560> 10<00:03:34.130> so<00:03:34.880> at<00:03:35.300> this<00:03:35.810> point<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.140> would<00:03:36.260> say

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
or 10 so at this point you would say

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.800 
or 10 so at this point you would say
that<00:03:36.530> this<00:03:36.920> is<00:03:37.130> a<00:03:37.160> prime<00:03:37.519> number<00:03:37.720> all<00:03:38.720> right

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 
that this is a prime number all right

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.949 
that this is a prime number all right
it's<00:03:38.959> only<00:03:39.260> divisible<00:03:39.560> by<00:03:41.530> itself<00:03:42.530> or<00:03:42.860> one

it's only divisible by itself or one

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.070 
it's only divisible by itself or one
what<00:03:44.959> about<00:03:45.049> zero<00:03:45.560> is<00:03:45.830> zero<00:03:46.070> a<00:03:46.400> prime<00:03:46.670> number

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
what about zero is zero a prime number

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:53.680 
what about zero is zero a prime number
well<00:03:48.080> no<00:03:48.200> it's<00:03:48.380> not<00:03:48.590> we<00:03:48.799> put<00:03:49.040> neither<00:03:49.310> here<00:03:52.690> 0

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
well no it's not we put neither here 0

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.580 
well no it's not we put neither here 0
or<00:03:54.140> 1<00:03:54.560> are<00:03:54.950> both<00:03:55.340> going<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.610> be<00:03:55.670> an<00:03:55.970> eater<00:03:56.590> all

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:57.590 
or 1 are both going to be an eater all

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:59.320 
or 1 are both going to be an eater all
right<00:03:57.680> what<00:03:58.010> about<00:03:58.040> for<00:03:58.340> part<00:03:58.549> 3<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:58.880> have<00:03:58.970> 21

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
right what about for part 3 we have 21

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:02.410 
right what about for part 3 we have 21
he's<00:04:00.230> 21<00:04:00.799> divisible<00:04:01.250> by<00:04:01.310> anything<00:04:02.000> other<00:04:02.150> than

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
he's 21 divisible by anything other than

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:06.670 
he's 21 divisible by anything other than
itself<00:04:02.780> 21<00:04:03.470> or<00:04:04.130> the<00:04:04.370> number<00:04:04.519> one<00:04:05.230> well<00:04:06.230> i<00:04:06.470> can

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
itself 21 or the number one well i can

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.550 
itself 21 or the number one well i can
divide<00:04:06.860> 21<00:04:07.340> by<00:04:07.489> three<00:04:07.760> right<00:04:08.150> 21/3<00:04:09.140> would<00:04:09.470> give

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
divide 21 by three right 21/3 would give

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:12.729 
divide 21 by three right 21/3 would give
me<00:04:09.650> 7<00:04:10.190> all<00:04:11.060> right<00:04:11.150> so<00:04:11.330> 21<00:04:11.810> is<00:04:12.170> divisible<00:04:12.500> by

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
me 7 all right so 21 is divisible by

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.100 
me 7 all right so 21 is divisible by
something<00:04:13.160> other<00:04:13.459> than<00:04:13.730> itself<00:04:14.000> or<00:04:14.239> one<00:04:14.450> so

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
something other than itself or one so

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.599 
something other than itself or one so
this<00:04:15.320> is<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> composite<00:04:16.010> number<00:04:18.340> okay<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:19.430> what

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
this is a composite number okay so what

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.810 
this is a composite number okay so what
about<00:04:19.700> part<00:04:20.060> 4<00:04:20.330> here<00:04:20.539> we<00:04:20.660> have<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:20.870> number<00:04:21.140> 5

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
about part 4 here we have the number 5

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
five is going to be a prime number okay

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.900 
five is going to be a prime number okay
what<00:04:31.610> about<00:04:31.699> part<00:04:32.000> 5<00:04:32.270> we<00:04:33.110> have<00:04:33.229> the<00:04:33.350> number<00:04:33.590> 12

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
what about part 5 we have the number 12

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.760 
what about part 5 we have the number 12
well<00:04:34.910> I<00:04:34.940> know<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.270> 12/6<00:04:36.199> would<00:04:36.350> give<00:04:36.440> me<00:04:36.530> too

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
well I know that 12/6 would give me too

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.159 
well I know that 12/6 would give me too
so<00:04:37.520> that's<00:04:37.699> something<00:04:38.000> other<00:04:38.360> than<00:04:38.600> itself<00:04:38.930> or

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:39.169 
so that's something other than itself or

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.610 
so that's something other than itself or
one<00:04:39.380> so<00:04:39.590> this<00:04:39.680> is<00:04:39.800> going<00:04:39.889> to<00:04:39.979> be<00:04:40.039> composite
