00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 and good if all that commenting and you 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.290
 I bring new black ops gameplay like 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.420
 not to talk about black ops 2 and all the 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.450
 new information in which they have been taking 

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:14.490
 zombies weapons a lot of things and about 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.800
 all thank angel but have 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:21.300
 passed a lot of information and 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.070
 we will also confirm a lot of things 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.779
 the first thing that is confirmed is treated 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.810
 of zombie game mode that we 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.279
 I was saying days ago that I was going to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.560
 have supposedly a mode of 2004 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.570
 against 4 well confirmed one hundred percent 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.520
 do not ask anymore, you do not know anything else nor 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.250
 how is it going to be with 4 against 4 I do not even have 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.809
 idea if it's going to be competitive good 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.110
 obviously it will be competitive from 4 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.879
 to 4 but do not know do not know I have no 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.590
 idea does not even fit me in my 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.739
 head how to see ones with some zombies 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.010
 competitive but not good there is that 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.780
 one more doubt that is clear and the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.550
 time another one that we have left for 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.030
 clear not knowing how it's really going to 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.980
 be this game mode is also 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.530
 confirmed in campaign mode a look 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.489
 of x-ray ie with which you can 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.460
 watch 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.490
 through the walls and so on will be a 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.100
 measured only for campaign mode 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.560
 it will be a measure for the mode 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.909
 multiplayer also personally I think 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.759
 which will be only for when campaign 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.110
 is personally I believe and I hope for the 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.570
 game go too well on track 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.130
 as for the fool with one of these 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.340
 measures the truth I do not think it's 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.350
 necessary so good they said that a 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.679
 confirmed x-ray mile well 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:36.630
 confirmed they said that the 395 you know 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.320
 that in this game is a leftover 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.500
 say in this game can and 95 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.140
 buff is scary on the moll woofer 3 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.670
 and yet in the white flower they are going to 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.800
 but nevertheless put in to put a 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.270
 true 35 balanced all areas go 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.820
 to be balanced there are no patches 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.100
 to balance the weapons and prevent 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.940
 some that in sobre powered although 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.740
 here I must emphasize that we 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:04.550
 we have a weapon for example by rule of 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:07.160
 bursts do not put 2016 was which killed 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.690
 a burst let's say for example and without 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.429
 however good data 95 kills a 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.590
 burst and we complain our kills one 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.720
 burst we have the 1016 that kills 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.310
 two or three good kills two or 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.690
 three but let's say it kills more than one 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.910
 burst and we complain that it is 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.380
 too bad but when they put one that 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.800
 Kills a burst we really complain 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:26.870
 It is quite absurd that I have not 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.220
 given by thinking I will prove it is that if 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.769
 we say that disgust killed a burst 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.230
 some complain and if we say that there is no 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.780
 cases that jugs on average and by 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 nature we complain so good not 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.590
 I know what you see going out but it's something 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.390
 quite curious in fact is that this 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.420
 it seems funny is against us 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:45.360
 let's say with ourselves go so 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.160
 good 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.810
 also in the campaign for all 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:52.170
 fans of the campaigns of the saga 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:53.670
 known you well we were not going to fight 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.780
 too much against robots everything 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.730
 we see in the trailer good was going to be 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.860
 practically everything against soldiers 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 enemies and so on is not going to have 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.390
 the super cosmic robots that from the 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.280
 killzone for example not just not 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.630
 they will be the same as sometimes it did not come out yet 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.240
 go to some modern mission 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:10.860
 warfare2 well here you can take us 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:13.080
 a hand let's say a robot or any 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.120
 another thing but it's not going to be 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.250
 fighting all the time against assets and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.560
 Ten things is not for nothing that they have 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.020
 discarded one hundred percent and in addition 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.370
 says treyarch good stars no 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:31.120
 discards a single game of zombies is 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.130
 say that if in a future if in a 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.480
 expansion or do not know do not know 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:40.840
 exactly but do not rule out doing 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.879
 let's say something something that is only 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.459
 zombies a game that we say has been 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.959
 characterized a lot the room 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.140
 crashing games by faces meals 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:51.970
 on wheels zombies and get to the point and 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.360
 limit let's say good to an opposite pole 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:58.080
 in which it would be only no longer online 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.140
 with competitive people but only 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:04.690
 play zombies not inside zombies 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:07.150
 man imagine it is a 15 maps of 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.500
 zombies do not and every month he takes you out every 3 or 4 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.989
 months you get three or four maps 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.990
 new would not be bad at all but I think 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:15.460
 what 

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:17.410
 they would not have so many people of those 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.959
 typical casual players 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.500
 John 15 minutes at a time sometimes once 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.180
 a week 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:24.490
 so if you want to play in zombies 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.440
 you really are not going to play 15 minutes and in 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.960
 half of the game does not annoy your 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.060
 three other classmates do not think that what 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.130
 do so would be pretty absurd but not 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:35.110
 is discarded so maybe it is not 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.710
 foolishness may need to be polished 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.760
 enough but it is not ruled out so 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.110
 enough information about everything 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.480
 related to the zombies that is I have 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.460
 enough desire 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.660
 let's say that but a lot of medium information 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.080
 I do not know what you think 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.690
 but good with this I say goodbye I hope 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.060
 that you liked this example and a 37 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:57.220
 0 if I'm not wrong a big game in 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.960
 the black ops as I tell you nothing we 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.300
 or all for the video I like favorites 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.300
 if it has served you and is close to God
