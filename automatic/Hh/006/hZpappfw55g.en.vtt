00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
with the line sight which is a Awad on

with the line sight which is a Awad on
the<00:01:07.799> inside<00:01:08.190> with<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:09.080> little<00:01:10.080> fingers<00:01:10.440> that

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
the inside with the little fingers that

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.660 
the inside with the little fingers that
open<00:01:10.920> up<00:01:11.040> only<00:01:11.220> it's<00:01:11.520> not<00:01:11.610> nearly<00:01:12.240> as<00:01:13.310> rigid<00:01:14.310> as

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
open up only it's not nearly as rigid as

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.760 
open up only it's not nearly as rigid as
what<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.060> federal<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> okay<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> federal<00:01:16.680> is

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
what the federal is okay the federal is

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.279 
what the federal is okay the federal is
a<00:01:16.799> very<00:01:17.130> very<00:01:17.460> rigid<00:01:17.700> wad<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.390> there<00:01:18.630> and

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:19.289 
a very very rigid wad in there and

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:21.590 
a very very rigid wad in there and
that's<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.159> reason<00:01:20.460> that<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.729> thought<00:01:20.969> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
that's the reason that we thought we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.260 
that's the reason that we thought we
probably<00:01:21.930> shouldn't<00:01:22.530> be<00:01:22.680> shooting<00:01:22.859> it<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
probably shouldn't be shooting it to

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.810 
probably shouldn't be shooting it to
better<00:01:24.270> master<00:01:24.600> chokes<00:01:25.219> now<00:01:26.219> we<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.549> calls

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
better master chokes now we get calls

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.999 
better master chokes now we get calls
from<00:01:27.030> customers<00:01:27.299> all<00:01:27.719> the<00:01:27.750> time<00:01:27.899> and<00:01:28.350> I<00:01:28.500> guess

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
from customers all the time and I guess

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.349 
from customers all the time and I guess
they<00:01:29.189> didn't<00:01:29.429> get<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.640> word<00:01:29.789> because<00:01:30.179> they've

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:30.359 
they didn't get the word because they've

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:33.230 
they didn't get the word because they've
been<00:01:30.450> doing<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.840> years<00:01:31.100> but<00:01:32.100> we've<00:01:33.060> never

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
been doing it for years but we've never

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.669 
been doing it for years but we've never
had<00:01:33.509> an<00:01:33.659> incident<00:01:34.020> with<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:34.679 
had an incident with it

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.440 
had an incident with it
but<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:36.500> just<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.649> be<00:01:37.799> cautious<00:01:38.070> we<00:01:38.490> advise

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
but just just to be cautious we advise

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.190 
but just just to be cautious we advise
not<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.929> shoot<00:01:40.109> it<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.289> that<00:01:40.619> now<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.340> have<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:42.200 
not to shoot it to that now we have the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.139 
not to shoot it to that now we have the
the<00:01:43.200> black<00:01:44.009> cloud<00:01:44.310> choke<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:44.999> can

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
the black cloud choke that they can

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.109 
the black cloud choke that they can
shoot<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.630> him<00:01:45.749> the<00:01:46.350> Winchester<00:01:47.119> in

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
shoot it to him the Winchester in

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.310 
shoot it to him the Winchester in
cooperation<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.520> we<00:01:50.520> did<00:01:50.729> design<00:01:51.149> a

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
cooperation with them we did design a

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.959 
cooperation with them we did design a
blindside<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.740> form

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:54.969 
blindside to form

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:58.950 
blindside to form
and<00:01:55.869> it<00:01:56.020> shoots<00:01:56.259> very<00:01:56.530> well<00:01:56.770> and<00:01:57.219> I<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.960> all

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
and it shoots very well and I think all

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.779 
and it shoots very well and I think all
the<00:01:59.140> people<00:01:59.289> that<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.950> like<00:02:00.159> The<00:02:00.310> Blind<00:02:00.490> Side

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:00.789 
the people that that like The Blind Side

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:04.289 
the people that that like The Blind Side
animal<00:02:01.179> is<00:02:01.329> going<00:02:01.509> to<00:02:01.600> like<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:02.049> choke<00:02:03.299> we

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
animal is going to like this choke we

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.949 
animal is going to like this choke we
make<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:04.659> into<00:02:04.929> the<00:02:05.649> full<00:02:05.890> and<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.189> modified
