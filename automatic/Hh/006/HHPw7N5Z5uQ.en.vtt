00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.879

 the varianta 37 is simply he of our 44 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:13.240
 it is a lot of boat for little money 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.110
 only there is 37 more complete standard 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.590
 Delivered 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 then 44 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.880
 we have set and almost the ideal 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.950
 circumstances how could well with 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:25.780
 vehicles sail and then they miss them 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.520
 Kings come with the two options 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.850
 those on the boat are in good hands 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.799
 the fame of the varianta 37 has itself 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.380
 has already proven itself on the hanse 370 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.880
 seated and we noticed that when sailing 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.700
 it is a very light boat 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.810
 accelerates quickly and holds itself 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 also very good on course 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.940
 the interior of the boat is simple 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.900
 but nicely finished and also very 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.820
 complete 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.050
 the 2 sleeping places in the tip with considerable 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.720
 cupboard space 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.250
 enough people in the living room 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:04.770
