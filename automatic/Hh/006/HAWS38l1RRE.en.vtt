will draw a knife with colored pencils
and<00:00:15.330> pastel<00:00:16.460> we<00:00:17.460> start<00:00:17.789> with<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.060> guideline

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and pastel we start with a guideline

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.859 
and pastel we start with a guideline
slightly<00:00:19.439> tilted<00:00:20.359> remember<00:00:21.359> that<00:00:21.510> the<00:00:21.630> part

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
slightly tilted remember that the part

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410 
slightly tilted remember that the part
of<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.080> eye<00:00:22.230> that<00:00:22.320> is<00:00:22.769> toward<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.699> center<00:00:24.390> of

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420

of the eye that is toward the center of
the<00:00:24.539> face<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.590> little<00:00:25.920> bit<00:00:26.070> lower<00:00:27.320> then<00:00:28.320> we

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
the face is a little bit lower then we

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.380 
the face is a little bit lower then we
sketch<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.800> shape

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
sketch the shape

we<00:02:11.620> smudged<00:02:11.950> to<00:02:12.250> soften

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.750 

in<00:02:17.290> this<00:02:17.500> drawing<00:02:17.800> I'm<00:02:18.069> using<00:02:18.340> a<00:02:18.550> combination

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
in this drawing I'm using a combination

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.500 
in this drawing I'm using a combination
of<00:02:19.300> color<00:02:20.140> pencils<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:21.150> pastel<00:02:22.150> pencils

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
of color pencils and pastel pencils

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.180 
of color pencils and pastel pencils
color<00:02:25.510> pencils<00:02:26.080> are<00:02:26.230> great<00:02:26.500> for<00:02:26.739> the<00:02:26.860> detail

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
color pencils are great for the detail

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.059 
color pencils are great for the detail
however<00:02:28.120> they<00:02:28.599> don't<00:02:28.660> smudge<00:02:29.140> hardly<00:02:29.650> at<00:02:29.860> all

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
however they don't smudge hardly at all

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.059 
however they don't smudge hardly at all
therefore<00:02:31.000> when<00:02:31.540> I<00:02:31.660> when<00:02:31.870> smudging<00:02:32.440> I<00:02:32.620> use<00:02:33.040> a

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 
therefore when I when smudging I use a

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.010 
therefore when I when smudging I use a
pastel<00:02:33.670> pencils<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:37.180> complete<00:02:37.569> list<00:02:37.870> of

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.330 

we<00:02:55.510> continue<00:02:55.990> working<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.530> chorus<00:02:56.920> and

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
we continue working the chorus and

I<00:03:02.730> said<00:03:03.730> no

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:22.429 

let's<00:03:20.290> storm<00:03:20.650> the<00:03:20.709> background<00:03:21.280> with<00:03:21.459> pencil

00:03:22.429 --> 00:03:22.439 
let's storm the background with pencil

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:25.559 
let's storm the background with pencil
we<00:03:23.439> smudge<00:03:23.709> it<00:03:23.890> with<00:03:24.099> a<00:03:24.129> brush<00:03:24.459> so<00:03:25.030> then<00:03:25.209> we<00:03:25.360> can

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
we smudge it with a brush so then we can

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:30.270 
we smudge it with a brush so then we can
pull<00:03:25.780> lights<00:03:26.049> with<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> kneaded<00:03:26.890> eraser<00:03:29.280> the

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
pull lights with a kneaded eraser the

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.550 
pull lights with a kneaded eraser the
lights<00:03:30.519> are<00:03:30.730> hardly<00:03:31.000> visible<00:03:31.239> so<00:03:31.840> we<00:03:32.230> have<00:03:32.409> to

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
lights are hardly visible so we have to

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.979 
lights are hardly visible so we have to
darken<00:03:33.010> a<00:03:33.099> little<00:03:33.400> bit<00:03:33.519> more<00:03:35.190> that's<00:03:36.190> better

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
darken a little bit more that's better

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.259 
darken a little bit more that's better
we<00:03:37.989> may<00:03:38.170> also<00:03:38.530> pull<00:03:38.980> some<00:03:39.159> reflections<00:03:39.730> which

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
we may also pull some reflections which

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:48.420 
we may also pull some reflections which
give<00:03:40.870> life<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:45.930> don't<00:03:46.930> like<00:03:47.290> the<00:03:47.470> upper<00:03:47.889> eyelids

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
give life I don't like the upper eyelids

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.000 
give life I don't like the upper eyelids
so<00:03:48.730> blue<00:03:49.000> so<00:03:49.450> I'll<00:03:49.540> put<00:03:49.750> some<00:03:49.989> skin<00:03:50.440> color<00:03:50.739> on
