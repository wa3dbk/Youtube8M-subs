00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.430
 Arseny Arseny Yatsenyuk likes to talk 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:07.470
 but it can go sideways because 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.540
 as we will show you now 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.540
 inconsistent in almost all matters 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.650
 they created such a financial pyramid 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.539
 starting with the bretton woods agreement 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.939
 only brilliant people can do it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.760
 put the whole world on a single injection 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.990
 us dollars and print them yes they are great 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.580
 financial pyramid he decides interesting 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.439
 did he share these thoughts with 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.450
 US President Barrack Obama 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.489
 when talking to him in the white house on 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.210
 what is more interesting Yatsenyuk said that 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.579
 America 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.690
 made Russia a victim of its financial 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.850
 fraud remember i told you that 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.640
 Russia earned a lot of money but also where 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.260
 they they were lowered for a year central bank 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.079
 Russia spent 300 billion dollars 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.180
 I'll tell you what happened Russia 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.010
 again developed her kind of allowed 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.899
 earn and then took away everything 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.940
 she was simply not allowed to use 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.750
 the money she received the sale 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.550
 oil and gas 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.090
 all the money went to maintain the course 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:08.310
 the ruble and now this money is not there but 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.040
 According to Yatsenyuk, Russia has a very good 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.380
 President to hell or something like Putin 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.600
 with his changes the way he performed his 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.850
 historical mission to save Russia 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.650
 where was the big gap between the classes 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.049
 and clans between the common people and 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.850
 oligarchs as in Ukraine in Russia 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.159
 there were five oligarchs who were tearing 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.530
 country apart with loyal to them 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.119
 MPs, we see that Putin chose 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.619
 certain way and i can't 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.450
 compete with him by quantity 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.579
 great decisions that he made 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.619
 Yesterday I realized that it is not known that I 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.549
 did i lead so big and 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:44.970
 unmanaged country I let kolis 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:47.100
 incredible verse 9 sorry that Arseny 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.680
 Yatsenyuk does not want to cooperate with a man 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 about which he has such a high opinion in 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.770
 certain moment cave hotel 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.939
 partnership with nato but surprisingly 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.310
 Yatsenyuk has his own scores with alliance 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.079
 you don't know the plague know why they are over 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.360
 are buying our military transport 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.219
 airplanes are interesting to me 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.500
 we are supposed to be partners 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.649
 I would like us to sell ours 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.880
 NATO airplanes on the country but they buy 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.620
 airbus boeing and embraer 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.540
 but NATO will not use their 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.730
 helicopters and you enjoy our 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.090
 Of course much more profitable to send in 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.090
 Darfur Ukrainian helicopters 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.860
 5 some modernization they act and so 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.140
 Yatsenyuk changed his decision about 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.300
 membership in nato but what about his favorite 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:36.010
 the European Union because of which the whole began 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.950
 this chaos in Ukraine we will be part 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.690
 great europe because we are europeans and 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.660
 I put this to our top priority 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:48.820
 the task is to make us part of europe and 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:50.890
 tse our task great honor enter in 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.660
 the composition with which he glorifies many 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.580
 years making a regular move on chess 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.410
 blackboard and declare that it is the only 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:58.210
 way for his country and all this for 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:01.150
 to finally recognize that this never 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.370
 won't bannigan nobody's gonna 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.710
 there is nobody else to take we have it already 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.170
 understood and moreover nobody will accept 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.880
 Ukraine in which 46 million inhabitants and 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.630
 which is approximately equal in area 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.580
 france 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.070
 Ukraine acts as a kind of 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.650
 border area large border 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.320
 lanes between the European Union and Russia between 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:24.700
 democracy and the axis of evil from taking the path 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:26.170
 forming a safety belt and again 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.480
 impartial remarks about 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.070
 Russia but the point is not in these statements and 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.770
 does not even support anyone 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:34.780
 or not Yatsenyuk matter in the presence of his plan 

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:36.580
 lack of concern for many including even 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.440
 those who supported Yatsenyuk during 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.180
 coup d'Ã©tat why 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.670
 because they no longer know what 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.940
 they support marina Kosarev 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.940
