well detailed they're well made they're

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.380 
well detailed they're well made they're
kind<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.829> made<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.280> I'm<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.820> sure<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.180> Doug

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
kind of made of I'm not sure what Doug

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
kind of made of I'm not sure what Doug
material<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.079> a<00:01:40.110> clay<00:01:40.470> material<00:01:41.220> actually

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
material like a clay material actually

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.139 
material like a clay material actually
and<00:01:42.140> right<00:01:43.140> now<00:01:43.290> this<00:01:43.829> one<00:01:44.159> is<00:01:44.460> very<00:01:44.670> expensive

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
and right now this one is very expensive

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.200 
and right now this one is very expensive
they're<00:01:45.270> usually<00:01:45.360> thirty<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.200> forty<00:01:46.500> dollars

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
they're usually thirty to forty dollars

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.190 
they're usually thirty to forty dollars
so<00:01:48.210> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.329> can<00:01:48.420> buy<00:01:48.509> them<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.720> a<00:01:48.810> set<00:01:49.020> usually

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
so if you can buy them in a set usually

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
so if you can buy them in a set usually
it's<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> bit<00:01:49.560> better<00:01:49.680> but<00:01:50.490> usually<00:01:51.030> they're<00:01:51.180> in

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
it's a bit better but usually they're in

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.609 
it's a bit better but usually they're in
half<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:51.840> you<00:01:51.930> have<00:01:52.020> to<00:01:52.079> put<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:52.380> top<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
half and you have to put on the top and

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.080 
half and you have to put on the top and
the<00:01:52.890> bottom<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.189> the<00:01:53.310> base<00:01:53.460> so<00:01:53.850> there's<00:01:54.000> not

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the bottom and the base so there's not

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.219 
the bottom and the base so there's not
that<00:01:54.149> much<00:01:54.360> to<00:01:54.540> put<00:01:54.659> them<00:01:54.750> together<00:01:54.869> they're

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
that much to put them together they're

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:56.780 
that much to put them together they're
pretty<00:01:55.380> awesome<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:56.130> do<00:01:56.189> have<00:01:56.399> some<00:01:56.549> have<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.069 
pretty awesome they do have some have to
them<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.000> they<00:01:57.060> do<00:01:57.180> have<00:01:57.270> some<00:01:57.420> weight<00:01:57.600> so

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
them but they do have some weight so

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.679

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.160 
I didn't actually unbox them in this
video<00:02:59.580> but<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.120> did<00:03:00.330> have<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.750> that<00:03:00.960> looked

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
video but I did have one that looked

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.810 
video but I did have one that looked
like<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> was<00:03:01.470> sealed<00:03:01.770> and<00:03:02.130> what<00:03:02.370> turned<00:03:02.640> out

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
like it was sealed and what turned out

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:04.580 
like it was sealed and what turned out
happening<00:03:03.300> is<00:03:03.510> this<00:03:03.960> looks<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.350> it's<00:03:04.530> a

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
happening is this looks like it's a

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:06.590 
happening is this looks like it's a
reseal<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:05.700> by<00:03:05.820> the<00:03:05.880> seller<00:03:06.180> so<00:03:06.480> when

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
reseal actually by the seller so when

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.720 
reseal actually by the seller so when
you<00:03:06.690> buy<00:03:06.840> them<00:03:07.050> they<00:03:07.530> won't<00:03:07.710> be<00:03:07.890> sealed<00:03:08.190> they

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
you buy them they won't be sealed they

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.610 
you buy them they won't be sealed they
should<00:03:08.940> just<00:03:09.060> come<00:03:09.270> in<00:03:09.510> a<00:03:09.600> black<00:03:09.750> box<00:03:10.110> in<00:03:10.500> a

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
should just come in a black box in a

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.980 
should just come in a black box in a
black<00:03:10.830> box<00:03:11.040> in<00:03:11.190> a<00:03:11.280> red<00:03:11.430> box<00:03:11.610> like<00:03:11.880> this<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.420> if

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:12.990 
black box in a red box like this and if

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:14.390 
black box in a red box like this and if
you<00:03:13.080> do<00:03:13.200> find<00:03:13.350> them<00:03:13.530> sealed<00:03:13.710> usually<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.370> a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
you do find them sealed usually it's a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.550 
you do find them sealed usually it's a
reset<00:03:14.790> seal<00:03:15.210> by<00:03:15.540> someone<00:03:15.990> who's<00:03:16.110> selling<00:03:16.440> it

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:20.640 
from my experience I don't think they

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.520 
from my experience I don't think they
came<00:03:20.790> sealed<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.390> where<00:03:21.810> they<00:03:22.020> come<00:03:22.140> from<00:03:22.200> in

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:26.060 
Japan they were actually from the crane
game<00:03:24.600> machines<00:03:25.080> that<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:25.500> came<00:03:25.709> down<00:03:25.920> with

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:26.070 
game machines that you came down with

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.470 
game machines that you came down with
the<00:03:26.160> crane<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:26.610> tried<00:03:26.730> to<00:03:26.820> pick<00:03:26.970> up<00:03:27.120> something

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
the crane and tried to pick up something

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.910 
the crane and tried to pick up something
and<00:03:27.600> everything<00:03:27.750> like<00:03:27.990> that<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.380> if<00:03:28.680> you<00:03:28.770> won

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
and everything like that and if you won

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.990 
and everything like that and if you won
the<00:03:29.040> game<00:03:29.160> then<00:03:29.370> you<00:03:29.430> could<00:03:29.550> get<00:03:29.670> one<00:03:29.820> of<00:03:29.910> these

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
the game then you could get one of these

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.360 
the game then you could get one of these
so<00:03:30.959> back<00:03:31.110> then<00:03:31.350> they<00:03:31.530> weren't<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:32.040> expensive

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so back then they weren't that expensive

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.980 
so back then they weren't that expensive
