00:00:06.617 --> 00:00:13.517
Heavenly Father, I know I am close to despair. 

00:00:13.517 --> 00:00:21.477
I feel so tempted to give up, to withdraw from live and religion

00:00:21.477 --> 00:00:29.297
and let the world simply carry me along.

00:00:29.297 --> 00:00:36.817
Everything seems so meaningless and nothing appeals to my better instincts.

00:00:36.817 --> 00:00:43.677
Help me to remember that Jesus gave meaning to everything in the world.

00:00:43.677 --> 00:00:50.057
Let me bank on that fact and get over this time of despair,

00:00:50.057 --> 00:00:57.417
to really believe in the depths of my being, that there is a reason for living.

00:00:57.417 --> 00:01:06.057
Show me the reason for my life and tell me what I must do.

00:01:06.057 --> 00:01:12.517
Bring home to me that I am never alone, but that You are with me

00:01:12.517 --> 00:01:17.957
even in the depths of despair.

00:01:17.957 --> 00:01:23.317
Remind me that no matter what I may endure now, 

00:01:23.317 --> 00:01:29.757
an unending joy awaits me in the future if I but cling

00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:34.877
tightly to You and your Son Jesus

00:01:34.877 --> 00:01:39.117
in the unity of the Holy Spirit. 

00:01:39.117 --> 00:01:41.257
AMEN

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:46.557
PRAYER IN TIMES OF NEED!

00:01:46.557 --> 00:01:52.817
Heavenly Father, in my present need, help me

00:01:52.817 --> 00:01:58.057
to believe that you aware of my anxiety 

00:01:58.057 --> 00:02:03.797
and will do what is best for me.

00:02:03.797 --> 00:02:08.177
Give me stength to trust You

00:02:08.177 --> 00:02:13.577
and put the present and future in Your Hands.

00:02:13.577 --> 00:02:19.997
Grant this through Christ, our Lord. AMEN

00:02:19.997 --> 00:02:26.337
PRAYER IN HOPELESS DESPERATION!

00:02:26.337 --> 00:02:31.017
Almighty, ever-living God, 

00:02:31.017 --> 00:02:36.817
You give me strength to the weary and new courage

00:02:36.817 --> 00:02:41.857
to those who have lost heart.

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:48.057
Hear the prayers of all who call on You in any trouble

00:02:48.057 --> 00:02:54.317
that they may have the joy of receiving Your help

00:02:54.317 --> 00:03:00.797
in their need. AMEN
