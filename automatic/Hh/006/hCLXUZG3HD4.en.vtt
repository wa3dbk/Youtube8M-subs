you<00:01:18.000> know<00:01:18.119> however<00:01:18.900> the<00:01:19.350> other<00:01:19.530> issue<00:01:19.799> is

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
you know however the other issue is

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.920 
you know however the other issue is
called<00:01:20.250> confrontation<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.420> we're<00:01:21.570> expecting

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
called confrontation so we're expecting

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.660 
called confrontation so we're expecting
a<00:01:22.229> confrontation<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:23.040> most<00:01:23.310> likely<00:01:23.430> should

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
a confrontation we most likely should

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.750 
a confrontation we most likely should
but<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.510> said<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> it's<00:01:25.020> not<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.290> whisper

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
but like I said if it's not a whisper

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.980 
but like I said if it's not a whisper
confrontation<00:01:26.760> they<00:01:26.909> could<00:01:27.180> actually<00:01:27.659> sneak

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
confrontation they could actually sneak

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.320 
confrontation they could actually sneak
in<00:01:28.350> and<00:01:28.619> get<00:01:28.890> Lydia<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.549> escape<00:01:29.970> but<00:01:30.150> what

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
in and get Lydia and escape but what

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:31.999 
in and get Lydia and escape but what
good<00:01:30.479> does<00:01:30.659> that<00:01:30.720> do<00:01:31.110> where<00:01:31.439> does<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.710> story

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
good does that do where does the story

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.340 
good does that do where does the story
go<00:01:32.130> from<00:01:32.580> there<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:33.060> they<00:01:33.210> run<00:01:33.450> away<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.990> mean

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
go from there do they run away I mean

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.359 
go from there do they run away I mean
they<00:01:34.860> could<00:01:35.100> leave<00:01:35.570> Dante<00:01:36.570> Dante<00:01:37.020> could<00:01:37.799> tell

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
they could leave Dante Dante could tell

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.039 
they could leave Dante Dante could tell
what<00:01:38.670> happens<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.479> then<00:01:39.600> they<00:01:39.750> could<00:01:39.930> go

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
what happens and then they could go

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.929 
what happens and then they could go
after<00:01:40.290> him<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.740> mean<00:01:40.920> they<00:01:41.070> could<00:01:41.250> extend<00:01:41.700> this

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
after him I mean they could extend this

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.359 
after him I mean they could extend this
storyline<00:01:42.330> further<00:01:42.869> and<00:01:43.110> further<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.650> think<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
storyline further and further I think a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.999 
storyline further and further I think a
small<00:01:45.119> little<00:01:45.479> skirmish<00:01:46.079> could<00:01:46.530> work<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
small little skirmish could work and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.160 
small little skirmish could work and
then<00:01:47.369> they<00:01:47.520> flee<00:01:47.939> and<00:01:48.240> they<00:01:48.390> gotta<00:01:48.600> go<00:01:48.810> looking

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
then they flee and they gotta go looking

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
then they flee and they gotta go looking
for<00:01:49.200> him<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.740> mean<00:01:50.009> that's<00:01:50.189> got<00:01:50.430> to<00:01:50.460> be<00:01:50.610> a<00:01:50.640> scary

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
this it could be just

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.500 
this it could be just
another<00:02:14.160> tease<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.000> boys<00:02:15.180> could

trial and have a little mini trial and

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.890 
trial and have a little mini trial and
say<00:02:32.130> listen<00:02:32.340> Carl<00:02:32.730> was<00:02:32.910> justified<00:02:33.450> he<00:02:33.750> was

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
say listen Carl was justified he was

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.540 
say listen Carl was justified he was
trying<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.230> help<00:02:34.410> his<00:02:34.590> friend<00:02:34.890> and<00:02:35.160> the<00:02:35.250> statin

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.930 
trying to help his friend and the statin
a<00:02:35.610> third<00:02:35.820> but<00:02:36.240> I<00:02:36.270> am<00:02:36.660> betting<00:02:37.140> that<00:02:37.520> 140<00:02:38.520> might

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
a third but I am betting that 140 might

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.880 
a third but I am betting that 140 might
just<00:02:39.300> be<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.750> huge<00:02:40.410> issue

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
just be a huge issue

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.070 
just be a huge issue
it's<00:02:41.130> hinting<00:02:41.489> to<00:02:41.730> a<00:02:41.970> death<00:02:42.300> so<00:02:42.720> we<00:02:42.750> might<00:02:43.050> just

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
it's hinting to a death so we might just

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.780 
it's hinting to a death so we might just
get<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:43.470> death<00:02:43.770> there<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:44.190> like<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.489> said<00:02:44.550> I

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
get a death there and like I said I

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.699 
get a death there and like I said I
truly<00:02:45.300> believe<00:02:45.600> that<00:02:45.630> we'll<00:02:46.110> get<00:02:46.290> a<00:02:46.350> big

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
truly believe that we'll get a big

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.220 
truly believe that we'll get a big
cliffhanger<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.580> issue<00:02:47.850> 138<00:02:48.630> that<00:02:48.870> we<00:02:49.020> won't

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
cliffhanger in issue 138 that we won't

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.979 
cliffhanger in issue 138 that we won't
even<00:02:49.350> get<00:02:49.560> resolved<00:02:50.160> until<00:02:50.489> issue<00:02:50.850> 140<00:02:51.720> you

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
even get resolved until issue 140 you

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:53.660 
even get resolved until issue 140 you
know<00:02:52.110> which<00:02:52.500> that's<00:02:52.769> another<00:02:53.070> thing<00:02:53.310> maybe<00:02:53.459> I

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
know which that's another thing maybe I

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.460 
know which that's another thing maybe I
shouldn't<00:02:54.269> think<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.750> because<00:02:55.170> we're

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
shouldn't think that because we're

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.280 
shouldn't think that because we're
getting<00:02:55.650> issue<00:02:55.950> 138<00:02:56.670> an<00:02:56.850> issue<00:02:57.030> 139<00:02:57.720> back<00:02:58.080> to

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.140 
getting issue 138 an issue 139 back to
back<00:02:58.500> maybe<00:02:58.950> they<00:02:59.190> do<00:02:59.250> resolve<00:02:59.940> that

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
back maybe they do resolve that

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.060 
back maybe they do resolve that
