00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:43.220
 shed but to open the shed 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.460
 we need the key that is in the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.850
 first floor of the hotel to enter the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.550

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.290
 green trash after we jump to the thing 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.410
 in front of us and once again we jump to the 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.830
 cornice of the building and so we climb to the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.830
 rooftop 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.670
 then we advance to the edge of 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.210
 building to jump towards the railing 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:17.580

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.290
 of the shed 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:53.470
 already with the key in our hands we 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:56.409
 we headed to the shed so we go back 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:59.700
 where we enter we jump the railing 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:02.860
 and then we jump to the opposite building 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.950
 we go to the shore and we leave 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.720
 fall on the ledge on the left 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.810
 we walked to the wall and climbed the 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.420
 roof of the other building we turn to the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.629
 left and we drop in the 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:19.659
 trap of the ground already being inside in 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:22.510
 the entrance there are some swords we grab 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:24.970
 one but we do not use it since it's going 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:27.389
 to serve to get the last piece of 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.389
 the motorcycle 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.870
 Now all ready and headed 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.319
 to the shed 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.420
 being there we open it and inside is the 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.840
 fourth part of the motorcycle 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.840
 The fork 

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.940
 now we only need the last 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.070
 part that is the handlebar of the motorbike for 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:01.380
 get it we need to go talk to 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:05.070
 which is the one that tells us where they are 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:07.470
 the survivors if they are lucky in 

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:10.140
 the first attempt is going to tell you that there 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:12.960
 two culeras in the mall that 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.610
 you have to rescue if you are not going to have to 

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:17.340
 start helping all 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:19.920
 survivors until it's the turn of 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:22.350
 those two are the third in order of 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.230
 appearance or in case it gets 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.540
 asshole voice when they give between six and 

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.170
 six thirty already tells us that there are those 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.170
 two guys 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:39.980
 when he tells us that we have them 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:41.690
 rescue we got off the building and we 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:43.320
 we headed to the mall 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.900
 weak 

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:48.900
 remember that they need the broadsword that 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:51.570
 We grabbed a while ago if they do not have it 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:54.300
 just enter the store again 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:57.290
 that has the door open and take a 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.290
 been a new 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.510
 since we have everything ready we enter 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.330
 shopping center and in the background in a 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.590
 window looks at a pair of assholes that 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:18.090
 they are fighting for their miserable lives 

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.430
 we went out to help them kill those 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:23.340
 zombie bastards and when they're not 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:26.130
 fighting we talk to Jason he has the 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:28.020
 handlebar of the bike will tell us that 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.500
 you can give it to us if we change it for 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.990
 a broadsword and since we already have one 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:37.590
 we change by the handlebar and so 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:39.990
 we get the last piece of the bike and 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.030
 with all the parts of the bike only 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:44.610
 we return to the refuge to put the last 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:47.960
 and unlock the achievement 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:51.389
