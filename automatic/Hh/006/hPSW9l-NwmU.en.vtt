with the solid metal it's kind of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.340

retarded<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.539> make<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.690> look<00:00:57.840> like<00:00:57.989> it's<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.289> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
retarded to make it look like it's got a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.720 
retarded to make it look like it's got a
grill<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.859> then<00:00:59.010> just<00:00:59.219> fill<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> in<00:00:59.670> with

grill but then just fill it in with
metal<00:01:00.210> it's<00:01:00.390> kind<00:01:00.840> of<00:01:00.899> stupid<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:02.100> I'm<00:01:02.399> gonna

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
metal it's kind of stupid so I'm gonna

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.240 
metal it's kind of stupid so I'm gonna
sawzall<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.530> out<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:05.479> then<00:01:06.479> I've<00:01:06.689> already

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250

and<00:01:41.159> down<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.729> angle<00:01:42.240> them<00:01:42.450> they'll<00:01:42.810> be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
and down I can angle them they'll be

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.230 
and down I can angle them they'll be
brighter<00:01:43.290> and<00:01:43.590> they'll<00:01:44.100> be<00:01:44.220> rigged<00:01:44.460> strictly

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
brighter and they'll be rigged strictly

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.530 
brighter and they'll be rigged strictly

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
to the battery and not the alternator so

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.319 
to the battery and not the alternator so
they<00:01:48.810> won't<00:01:48.960> go<00:01:49.350> dim<00:01:49.619> when<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.119> lower<00:01:51.119> the

they won't go dim when I lower the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.039 
they won't go dim when I lower the
throttle<00:01:51.780> that<00:01:51.869> they'll<00:01:52.140> always<00:01:53.570> be<00:01:54.570> nice<00:01:54.810> and

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049

night<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> battery<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:33.350> it<00:02:33.470> and<00:02:33.709> it<00:02:33.800> works

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
night with a battery in it and it works

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.080 
night with a battery in it and it works
pretty<00:02:34.130> well<00:02:34.280> I'm<00:02:34.520> gonna<00:02:34.640> mount<00:02:34.790> it<00:02:34.880> right

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
pretty well I'm gonna mount it right

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.120 
pretty well I'm gonna mount it right
here<00:02:35.510> and<00:02:35.780> at<00:02:36.650> night

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
here and at night

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
here and at night
this<00:02:37.340> entire<00:02:37.810> area<00:02:38.980> shifter<00:02:40.150> throttle

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
this entire area shifter throttle

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.710 
this entire area shifter throttle
ignition<00:02:41.600> all<00:02:41.750> this<00:02:41.959> lights<00:02:42.470> up<00:02:42.709> with<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.010> nice

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
ignition all this lights up with a nice

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.040 
ignition all this lights up with a nice
yellow<00:02:44.720> yellowish<00:02:45.709> tint<00:02:46.010> light<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:47.810> that

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
yellow yellowish tint light and that

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.110 
yellow yellowish tint light and that
allowed<00:02:48.320> me<00:02:48.350> when<00:02:49.220> I'm<00:02:49.340> driving<00:02:49.610> at<00:02:49.850> night<00:02:49.880> I

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
allowed me when I'm driving at night I

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.490 
allowed me when I'm driving at night I
can<00:02:50.480> actually<00:02:50.860> see<00:02:51.860> what<00:02:52.720> speed<00:02:53.720> I'm<00:02:53.989> at<00:02:54.200> you

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
can actually see what speed I'm at you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.770 
can actually see what speed I'm at you
know<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.650> can<00:02:54.920> see<00:02:55.100> where<00:02:55.280> my<00:02:55.510> mission<00:02:56.510> switch

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
know I can see where my mission switch

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.030 
know I can see where my mission switch
is<00:02:57.080> and<00:02:57.800> all<00:02:58.520> that<00:02:58.730> jazz<00:02:59.060> so<00:02:59.360> that<00:02:59.510> would<00:02:59.630> be

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
is and all that jazz so that would be

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:05.199 
is and all that jazz so that would be
that'd<00:03:01.040> be<00:03:01.070> pretty<00:03:01.280> cool<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.940> when<00:03:04.940> we<00:03:05.090> have

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:05.209 
that'd be pretty cool but when we have

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:06.400 
that'd be pretty cool but when we have
to<00:03:05.269> do<00:03:05.390> is<00:03:05.540> I'm<00:03:05.630> gonna<00:03:05.750> have<00:03:05.900> to<00:03:06.019> drill<00:03:06.260> some

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
to do is I'm gonna have to drill some

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.280 
to do is I'm gonna have to drill some
pilot<00:03:06.470> holes<00:03:07.150> in<00:03:08.150> the<00:03:08.390> corner<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:08.959> can<00:03:09.170> get

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
pilot holes in the corner so I can get

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.229 
pilot holes in the corner so I can get
my<00:03:09.410> sawzall<00:03:09.950> blade<00:03:10.250> in<00:03:10.430> there<00:03:10.610> and<00:03:10.820> so<00:03:11.030> I<00:03:11.090> can

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
my sawzall blade in there and so I can

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.840 
my sawzall blade in there and so I can
cut<00:03:11.480> that<00:03:11.510> out<00:03:11.690> and<00:03:12.110> then<00:03:13.040> with<00:03:13.370> this<00:03:13.580> I'll

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
cut that out and then with this I'll

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.470 
cut that out and then with this I'll
just<00:03:13.880> have<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.269> use<00:03:15.010> salt<00:03:16.010> salt<00:03:16.700> salt<00:03:16.820> air<00:03:17.209> does

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
just have to use salt salt salt air does

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.009 
just have to use salt salt salt air does
I'll<00:03:17.720> probably<00:03:17.900> use<00:03:18.350> a<00:03:18.430> grinder<00:03:19.780> cutoff<00:03:20.780> wheel

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
I'll probably use a grinder cutoff wheel

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:25.539 
I'll probably use a grinder cutoff wheel
and<00:03:21.709> cut<00:03:22.700> that<00:03:22.880> out<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:24.250> then<00:03:25.250> I'll<00:03:25.340> go<00:03:25.519> from

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
and cut that out and then I'll go from

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:54.050 
and cut that out and then I'll go from
there

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.180 

okay<00:03:55.060> I<00:03:55.360> got<00:03:55.930> a<00:03:56.200> couple<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.620> holes<00:03:56.860> drilled

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
okay I got a couple of holes drilled

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.480 
okay I got a couple of holes drilled
there<00:03:57.430> so<00:03:57.940> I<00:03:58.000> get<00:03:58.180> my<00:03:58.300> saws<00:03:58.540> on<00:03:59.220> and<00:04:00.220> I<00:04:00.310> got

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:00.490 
there so I get my saws on and I got

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:06.960 
there so I get my saws on and I got
another<00:04:00.700> one<00:04:00.910> up<00:04:01.390> there<00:04:02.280> and<00:04:05.610> I've<00:04:06.610> got<00:04:06.670> these

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
another one up there and I've got these

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:09.330 
another one up there and I've got these
shorter<00:04:07.810> blades<00:04:08.410> that<00:04:08.740> I'm<00:04:08.860> probably<00:04:09.070> gonna

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
shorter blades that I'm probably gonna

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.449 
shorter blades that I'm probably gonna
use<00:04:09.730> for<00:04:10.270> the<00:04:10.330> majority<00:04:10.600> of<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:10.870> work<00:04:11.459> but

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
use for the majority of the work but

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.770 
use for the majority of the work but
just<00:04:12.610> in<00:04:12.760> case<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.150> have<00:04:13.330> these<00:04:13.570> awesome

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:13.780
