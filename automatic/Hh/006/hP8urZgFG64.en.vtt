Fantastic Four for people I know instead

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.750 
Fantastic Four for people I know instead
of<00:00:36.390> going<00:00:36.600> in<00:00:36.719> space<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.500> cosmic<00:00:38.040> rays<00:00:38.280> it<00:00:38.610> was

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
of going in space and cosmic rays it was

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.020 
of going in space and cosmic rays it was
a<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.649> teleportation<00:00:40.649> thing<00:00:41.100> into<00:00:41.399> dimension

a I teleportation thing into dimension

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.630 
a I teleportation thing into dimension
that's<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> going<00:00:42.840> would<00:00:43.460> and<00:00:44.460> this

like the final image which the thing

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.340 
like the final image which the thing
that<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> definitely<00:01:47.369> CGI<00:01:48.000> and<00:01:48.360> he's<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.689> SB

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
