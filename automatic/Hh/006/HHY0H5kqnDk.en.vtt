00:00:28.899 --> 00:00:32.449
 Jo because here is very easy music editing in Frankfurt and today I show you 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:36.690
 Kunert 80 watts of clenched tubes Power Media Germany namely the 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.960
 Diezel 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.770
 * this is about 180 watts of powerful nofollow an amplifier 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.550
 the company Dietzel and Metin Germany 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.070
 the amplifier is 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.720
 very far hand built 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.329
 yes there is still value I put on quality 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.880
 in the workshop to hear from the phone 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:56.859
 we have 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:02.539
 To principle first a subdivision of three channels yes Germany completely 

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.720
 three channel Egger amplifier 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.090
 CERN second row 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.590
 where Cell 2 has been going very much since there's already really the matter 

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.200
 inter-star yellow 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.480
 second channel had on this little plus switch he had tried one 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.620
 little the fence character in the second channel 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.530
 Canal 3 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.310
 Give a lot of work then solos respectively early 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.289
 sooner after having his 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:32.200
 second building block might still want to write and you can 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.450
 and secondly also and options 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.930
 the highlight of the reception there is no other fisherman in the world is this one 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.800
 Kath yes that is unique because it is really brutal that I show 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.330
 first of all 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.659
 yes, it plays now 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:50.409
 You can stick without using Cat and then Scholz with CAD 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.620
 No, that's pretty brutal what this little one is doing with Keith here 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.620
 Really Metal Mesic Water No coming out of it 

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:31.229
 then we still take the Master Section 

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:34.699
 There he has the option of two different reasons, according to Stern 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:38.000
 set the purely on the complete setting of the amplifier 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.310
 access year that is called Solo Switch Parker Beijing channel times a bit 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.799
 make louder depending on what you want 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.229
 the country singer sbe moves to the final stage 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.639
 There you can then find the best and the founder stages rules of Eislinger 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.899
 three-dimensionality 

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:56.259
 You can practically have to follow rules 

00:02:56.259 --> 00:02:59.599
 the amp until completely missing me that means they can be there like that 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.729
 Connecting baseboards Age what the stent can also write in Edi 

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:05.259
 switch 

00:03:05.259 --> 00:03:08.259
 for example, here is a switchable bug 

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.989
 to express more respect for the MEDISTAR at the same time 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.260
 At the counters very fine thing that you can then give, for example 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.769
 the fight Uma Thurman Uta numbers on the march of votes or would like 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:22.039
 Karl has to move out or whatever 

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:25.109
 and of course there raced to save the respective Freezers 

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:31.549
 and then I'll just show you a few clicks from the Herbert 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.149
 this was found with the clean channel 

00:03:34.149 --> 00:03:37.359
 although most of you probably will not use that often but 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:40.359
 nevertheless must be heard times 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.129
 can hear 

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:48.129
 Ben Maher 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.499
 flow 

00:03:52.499 --> 00:03:53.879
 7 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.879
 long 

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.649
 to have 

00:03:59.649 --> 00:04:02.649
 Sign in 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.279
 Now it's time for the second channel or there were already need 

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:12.479
 on the road with just once again out and I say that time now 

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:15.479
 Difference between in plus and minus 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.680
 on 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:01.629
 1 no 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:23.429
 and sometimes that they get a glimpse of the auction 

00:05:23.429 --> 00:05:27.789
 ask what he saw and Mesic has it on it is a really brutal box so 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.789
 every metal fan of this world if 

00:05:30.789 --> 00:05:33.909
 who is looking for good Madlen really 

00:05:33.909 --> 00:05:35.010
 he stands by that too 

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.789
 the title of Herrmann 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:41.800
 what is still good is of course 4 8 16 ohm box connection us series parallel 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.550
 eleven Aquitaine is all on the back there he has all 

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.550
 Connection options this still needs 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.120
 and a nice missing the good piece to try 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:54.210
 in Frankfurt 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:57.780
 on the Hanauer highway with music Schmidt stands the MP currently board 

00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:00.520
 as a rider comes by any time you can at any time 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:04.030
 Of course, just call or e-mail like men 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.949
 Best inquiries answer to the amplifier 

00:06:06.949 --> 00:06:09.020
 of course the possibility 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.190
 good amper easy to order online there you have 33 Hagemann the 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:15.949
 Mountains and lizards 16 but right of exchange 

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.960
 and yes, what I take off sooner shocked by a little boost 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:21.159
 brought more 

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.929
 in that sense or
