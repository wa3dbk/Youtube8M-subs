00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:06.840
 hello how about my name is ramiro curiel 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.930
 and I'm going to 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.520
 to help them with the melody of this song 

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:13.610
 which says we want to see jesus christ as 

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:15.410
 king 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.590
 it is a very simple song that is in the 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:22.480
 sun scale the sun scale the sun the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.400
 It has been re my F sharp sun 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.740
 is on a larger scale the chords are 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.250
 very basic in what we're going to 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.270
 focus is going to be the introduction 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:35.730
 Let's explain step by step so 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.950
 very very simple since he only has 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.870
 some other things that 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.510
 and they help make it much better obvious 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.310
 but there are those who by their level that barely 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.370
 they are starting they want to touch it but of 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.260
 a very simple way then this 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.210
 this one is just like for people a 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.120
 little between beginners and between 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.500
 beginners and intermediates then 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.600
 I hope you help them, let's start with the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.489
 finger two the middle finger we're going to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.200
 start the second fret eight string 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.700
 which is precisely a sun we can 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.800
 start through a slip we can 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.520
 start on the fifth five maybe five 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.520
 fret 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.729
 7 we are going to address the fret 8 that is 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.729
 a sun 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.830
 has more strength is not the same to start 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.170
 much more more 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.680
 it gives much better impression good we started 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.680
 in this sun 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.290
 we have here the one finger prepared for 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.980
 go to a king who is on the fifth fret 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.980
 on the third string 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.890
 to the sun of the second string 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.890
 and we slide 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:48.470
 aside that is the tenth after him 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.470
 louis 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.850
 I am again 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.610
 Sun 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:03.560
 because the first part the next 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.380
 part 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.479
 and we can start again a slip to 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.750
 through the sun but now with your finger 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.750
 one 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:18.230
 it is the second part 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.230
 we return with finger 3 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.129
 we perform the 12th fret which is a 5 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:32.680
 after all same second string 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.880
 we go with the little finger we go to 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.880
 fret 13 that is a natural gift 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:47.680
 and we come back and laila sun and slip 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.340
 good 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.670
 if you can put a little delay to 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:03.040
 your guitar and its distortion will sound 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:06.510
 much better because leaves leaves a bit of 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.510
 of corporation say it 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.560
 it is not based on the sky 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.829
 it's not a little bit of law, it's almost nothing 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.459
 but it helps pretty good the first 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.459
 part would be 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:25.550
 we can with the second part again at 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.550
 sun but now with your finger 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.260
 twice at the gala 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:37.580
 and again we start 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.580
 and we can do this 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.799
 and we started 

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:49.200
 about the king to start 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.830
 but no 

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:14.540
 and the clouds end to do the same 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.540
 only that the end would be 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.230
 note that comes along with voice 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.360
 because they want to use Christ 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:25.900
 there it would enter already is listening the song 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:28.510
 originals is not exactly the same but 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:31.660
 it's very similar then we are not in 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:33.760
 a very simple way but I'm 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.440
 I'm sure it's going to be very useful 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.440
 when they listen to it with the chords 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.280
 how well you listen and could assimilate 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:47.380
 the melody 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.380
 with my voice and playing the chords would be 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.090
 for for 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:59.800
 but it can not happen 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:08.610
 the good melody I hope you have them 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.990
 served much any question not 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.879
 You can write if you liked the video 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.360
 of like any comment is 

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.360
 you are welcome 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.009
 and here we are at your orders to 

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:19.009
 anything that 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.730
 I do not have tabs of this but I could 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.730
 help them in some way
