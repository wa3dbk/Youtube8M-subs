00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:07.000
 by friends of youtube my name is 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:09.429
 string man 1.350 this is my first video 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.990
 tutorial and I hope you like it and in 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.900
 this time I come to teach you how 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.110
 download and install wrestling in core 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.330
 for pc the first thing we have to do 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.820
 is to go to the next link credit bar in the 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.220
 description 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.100
 we copy it and paste it into our 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.030
 browser 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.160
 as you will see it went up on mediafire 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:33.650
 and you give it here in download 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:37.390
 Once downloaded they left us file 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.390
 We extract it 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.730
 and leave us a folder and in the folder 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.890
 will be in what is the installer and the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.890
 crack we left the installer 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.620
 and here on the board in this box that 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:54.989
 appears here is where we want to install 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.149
 our game seemed like a mistake to me 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.670
 I do not know if you will appear it is 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.550
 when you installed the game you do not create the 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.440
 folder in program files and 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.920
 solve this error by doing 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 following 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.360
 I created a folder in downloads called 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.540
 wrestling in color or as you 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.540
 want 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.979
 and that tells what works 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.380
 correctly that the folder that from here 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.880
 in here the game will be installed 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:34.520
 correctly we go in the welfare 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:36.470
 vision is to start installing the game yo 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.830
 will own the video so as not to do so 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.830
 long 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.750
 here as you will see the game has already been installed and 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.750
 they have put it 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.300
 this once installed they will not do the 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.820
 game since it is a trial version the 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.000
 which can only be one can only be 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.460
 used three times 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.450
 for a single to see how many times 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.520
 you want us to do the following 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.109
 we opened this folder where the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.660
 installer 

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:11.740
 we paste this file here where 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:14.920
 we installed our lincoln thickness 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.720
 we give it to move and replace and we can already 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.810
 play our game how many times 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.490
 We want good friends this was my first 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.090
 video tutorial and I hope you have 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:27.090
 liked the 1350 triman
