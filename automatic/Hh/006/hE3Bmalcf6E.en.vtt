I<00:01:19.659> think<00:01:20.409> he<00:01:20.470> has<00:01:20.560> more<00:01:20.830> than<00:01:20.950> one<00:01:21.130> bike<00:01:21.340> but

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.940 

right<00:01:25.150> now<00:01:25.270> he's<00:01:25.479> been<00:01:25.720> riding<00:01:26.049> his<00:01:26.970> dirt<00:01:27.970> bike

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
right now he's been riding his dirt bike

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.600 
right now he's been riding his dirt bike
which<00:01:29.950> is<00:01:30.100> just<00:01:30.340> another<00:01:30.579> view<00:01:31.270> you<00:01:31.540> know

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
which is just another view you know

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.520 
which is just another view you know
because<00:01:33.610> we<00:01:33.880> all<00:01:34.030> most<00:01:34.720> few<00:01:34.930> loggers<00:01:35.110> are<00:01:35.380> on

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
because we all most few loggers are on

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.740 
because we all most few loggers are on
the<00:01:35.619> streets<00:01:35.950> now<00:01:36.580> they<00:01:36.790> see<00:01:36.850> his<00:01:37.060> cars<00:01:37.330> but

the streets now they see his cars but

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.870 
the streets now they see his cars but

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:51.929 
routes
like<00:04:50.080> at<00:04:50.289> least<00:04:50.860> I<00:04:51.219> want<00:04:51.340> to<00:04:51.430> say<00:04:51.490> five<00:04:51.699> miles

00:04:51.929 --> 00:04:51.939 
like at least I want to say five miles

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:54.059 
like at least I want to say five miles
ahead<00:04:52.120> so<00:04:52.629> he<00:04:52.779> had<00:04:52.900> gotten<00:04:53.080> into<00:04:53.469> the<00:04:53.860> lane

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:54.069 
ahead so he had gotten into the lane

00:04:54.069 --> 00:04:57.420
