00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.449
 car 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:34.150
 Yes it started part 9 is last time 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:35.829
 I said that I will graduate slowly, but maybe I will still graduate slowly 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.160
 I will stop 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:43.640
 Well after I graduated slowly 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:49.760
 Up in the way of channel different from the long, it comes to be up 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:50.629
 I'm going to load Well I'm relieved from reporting when it 's up 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:57.260
 Please give me 

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:59.000
 I think that from this later varies the frequency to up the video from up to only a little now 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.030
 It's here. 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.100
 Please note that there is a convenience for the other day 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.390
 Hmm 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.300
 Hmm 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.880
 Last time I went to the Nether and I am a couple 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.050
 ni 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.660
 There is no profession without and only if Moon 10% growth 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.660
 In this way it may die unnaturally 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:26.240
 Wooper Cooper 4 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.320
 there is no 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.010
 When it says something, it changed the savings 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.150
 arm 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:40.660
 I made this skin myself, but I imagined it in summer 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.660
 It is peeled off to the shorts I made into a running figure 

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:48.370
 This wonder if was not this introduction is the egg pack apparatus of chicken 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.260
 Good now 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.260
 I I do not only tree You have to stand in it to start count to some extent 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.890
 Year cultivation this time of mushroom by Tteyuu 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:11.300
 I want to make so the mushroom does not face the sky 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:15.840
 If it is space below 12 brightness, it takes time to reach the surrounding area regardless of the planted block 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:18.959
 We will multiply at random but in the product version there are three 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:25.260
 Because it becomes difficult to grow when the degree is high 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:27.030
 In wikipedia, it is efficient to set up space and install rather than close 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.770
 It was written 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.770
 me 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.770
 Hmm 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:42.080
 In this time of mushroom cultivation room than usual for a visual-shaped house 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.560
 I want to make a mushroom cultivation room with a shape like a garden 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.860
 An ordinary child cultivation room 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.950
 And I'm going to fail, but this time is okay 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.810
 me 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.680
 me 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:58.680
 For now I 'm working a little so let's go to bed already tonight 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.620
 My husband somehow got slime 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:04.180
 I'll kill you later 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.180
 Let's take out the lime ball 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.890
 Sticky and sticky piston 2 items 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.220
 Wow meeting 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:19.670
 And is useless Gane honest 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.670
 It is he had received the amount of times the lock 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.930
 It's called a futon door 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:25.930
 It takes about to go weeks 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:38.980
 I took a picture, but it will not grow unless the mushroom brightness is 12 or less 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:45.130
 A I think you aside, but of course it had not been for lights monster 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:48.050
 Still, it's awkward if a creeper crawls and explodes while you 're in it 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:53.180
 Why do I want to turn on the lights below 10% 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:56.870
 I think this red stone torch is used this time 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:04:00.080
 This red stone torch has a light level of 7 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:03.130
 If Also Once it got dwarf monster 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.130
 Correct 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.430
 Hmm 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:08.569
 Oh 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:22.580
 Well then I 'm wearing a hair but the roof is up the stairs block so far 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:26.980
 This roof looks like the same building if it is a stair block , so this roof is 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.980
 I will use the half block 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:38.180
 I will finish it a little later, but I still haven't seen if I have finished it myself 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:38.180
 It is exciting at 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:45.139
 Well then it's finished 

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:52.139
 Let's turn on lights and see 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:53.289
 It is Tan came down Yes to confirm the brightness in than is First seen eye 

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.210
 People Ah ah came 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:56.990
 Correspondence from 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.990
 Understandable 

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:02.560
 A little one cup of red stone 

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:08.710
 I let Oite 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:09.340
 And shutout the roof I seem to contain the light of the sun, but I half block So 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:14.520
 right 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:17.789
 I do not know I 'm glad if someone can tell me in the comments 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.180
 A little bit of sunshine from the door 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:24.300
 I will change the piston door without 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:32.150
 At this time the two are Cairo 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:35.710
 I did not know that it took more time than expected to come 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.710
 Well then cut 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:45.260
 me 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:51.919
 Yes It's been an hour, it's been an hour since I was thinking for myself 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:58.830
 I have a video of other people in reference to give up to think anymore yourself 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:59.980
 Oh totally ignorant formula Desunmasen sister about his circuit 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.880
 me 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.950
 Let's get in right away 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:07.330
 me 

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:12.490
 me 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:14.310
 Oh my God I want to make cool Ow more 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.340

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:16.340
 Oh 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.250

 Oh cool I want to make more 

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:43.490
 In saying 

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:43.490
 I think that I will finish in this area this time 

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:52.060
 If you do not want mushrooms to grow, I'm thinking about measures so you can try it 

00:06:50.999 --> 00:06:56.910
 ani 

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:56.910
 Well then look forward to part 10 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.770
