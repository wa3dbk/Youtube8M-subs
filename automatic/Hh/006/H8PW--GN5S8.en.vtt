00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
this level of play though I can't

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.869 
this level of play though I can't
imagine<00:00:51.150> that<00:00:52.010> I'd<00:00:53.010> want<00:00:53.190> to<00:00:53.220> do<00:00:53.339> that<00:00:55.820> okay<00:00:56.820> so

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
imagine that I'd want to do that okay so

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.700 
imagine that I'd want to do that okay so
this<00:00:57.269> is<00:00:57.390> a<00:00:57.420> really<00:00:57.600> good<00:00:57.809> example<00:00:57.869> of<00:00:58.500> how<00:00:58.680> a

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
this is a really good example of how a

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.609 
this is a really good example of how a
screen<00:00:59.489> should<00:00:59.699> work<00:01:00.260> imagine<00:01:01.260> that<00:01:01.409> these

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
screen should work imagine that these

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:04.160 
screen should work imagine that these
rats<00:01:02.250> weren't<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:02.610> principles<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.989> want

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
rats weren't here principles you want

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.950 
rats weren't here principles you want
two<00:01:04.409> spaces<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.979> between<00:01:05.010> every<00:01:05.729> every<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.840> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
two spaces in between every every one of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.789 
two spaces in between every every one of
your<00:01:07.110> players<00:01:09.049> basically<00:01:10.049> what<00:01:10.409> happens<00:01:10.710> is

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
your players basically what happens is

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.260 
your players basically what happens is
the<00:01:10.950> person<00:01:11.280> always<00:01:11.460> like<00:01:11.850> we'll<00:01:12.030> have<00:01:12.060> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
the person always like we'll have to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.820 
the person always like we'll have to
make<00:01:12.360> two<00:01:12.600> Dodgers<00:01:12.960> get<00:01:13.170> through<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.619> they're

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
make two Dodgers get through and they're

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.969 
make two Dodgers get through and they're
always<00:01:13.979> on<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> three<00:01:14.460> plus<00:01:15.740> even<00:01:16.740> add<00:01:16.860> agility

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
always on a three plus even add agility

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.910 
always on a three plus even add agility
form<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:17.970> for<00:01:18.450> instance<00:01:18.510> like<00:01:18.900> if<00:01:19.140> this

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
form so for instance like if this

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.050 
form so for instance like if this
weren't<00:01:20.159> answers<00:01:20.460> they<00:01:20.580> wanted<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.880> get<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
weren't answers they wanted to get it

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
weren't answers they wanted to get it
he'd<00:01:21.840> come<00:01:22.049> here<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.470> then<00:01:22.650> you'd<00:01:22.740> have<00:01:22.799> the

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
he'd come here and then you'd have the

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.679 
he'd come here and then you'd have the
dodge<00:01:23.130> here<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.759> they<00:01:24.180> need<00:01:24.330> have<00:01:24.450> to<00:01:24.570> dodge

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
dodge here and they need have to dodge

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.230 
dodge here and they need have to dodge
again<00:01:24.840> up<00:01:25.110> here<00:01:25.259> or<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.619> here<00:01:25.650> I<00:01:25.830> suppose<00:01:26.240> so

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
again up here or up here I suppose so

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.910 
again up here or up here I suppose so
this<00:01:27.570> would<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.840> three<00:01:28.290> plus<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.530> then<00:01:28.890> a

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
this would be a three plus and then a

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.830 
this would be a three plus and then a
two<00:01:29.100> plus<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.760> then<00:01:30.030> he<00:01:30.120> still<00:01:30.330> has<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.600> work

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
two plus and then he still has to work

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.670 
two plus and then he still has to work
through<00:01:31.050> this<00:01:31.170> mountains

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.580 

but<00:01:36.680> a<00:01:36.710> quick<00:01:36.890> recap<00:01:37.550> on<00:01:37.700> the<00:01:37.760> rules<00:01:38.260> there<00:01:39.260> are

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
you get to choose one scale at the end

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.990 
you get to choose one scale at the end
of<00:01:44.690> the<00:01:44.810> the<00:01:45.650> game<00:01:45.830> and<00:01:46.460> give<00:01:46.730> it<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.910> any

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.090 

okay<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.600> you<00:02:23.200> see<00:02:23.350> here<00:02:23.470> this<00:02:23.620> isn't<00:02:23.770> a<00:02:23.920> full

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
okay so you see here this isn't a full

I<00:02:54.959> was<00:02:55.500> rather<00:02:55.620> high<00:02:55.830> risk<00:02:56.069> play<00:02:56.340> I<00:02:56.519> don't<00:02:56.730> know

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
I was rather high risk play I don't know

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:16.350 
I was rather high risk play I don't know
why<00:02:56.910> it<00:02:56.970> took<00:02:57.090> it

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:16.360

you can look here the Alps can't really
come<00:03:33.150> in<00:03:33.270> this<00:03:33.390> direction<00:03:33.570> because<00:03:33.900> there's

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.480

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
else can score so quickly that stalling

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.470 
else can score so quickly that stalling
is<00:03:49.640> not<00:03:49.880> necessary<00:03:50.920> so<00:03:51.920> this<00:03:52.310> is<00:03:52.610> good<00:03:53.090> as<00:03:53.330> well

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 
is not necessary so this is good as well

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.320 
is not necessary so this is good as well
run<00:03:53.720> offense<00:03:54.050> and<00:03:54.880> here<00:03:55.880> is<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.150> most

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:56.330 
run offense and here is the most

sad<00:04:42.800> day<00:04:42.980> okay<00:04:43.490> looking<00:04:43.820> in<00:04:43.880> his<00:04:43.940> defense<00:04:48.130> this

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130

sad day okay looking in his defense this
is<00:04:49.310> a<00:04:49.340> really<00:04:50.230> good<00:04:51.230> defense<00:04:51.680> in<00:04:51.830> my<00:04:51.980> opinion

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
is a really good defense in my opinion

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.720 
is a really good defense in my opinion
especially<00:04:53.000> for<00:04:53.510> skaven<00:04:54.100> these<00:04:57.430> it's<00:04:58.430> hard<00:04:58.670> to

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
especially for skaven these it's hard to

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:02.500 
especially for skaven these it's hard to
poke<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> hole<00:04:59.060> through<00:04:59.240> this<00:05:01.060> can't<00:05:02.060> just<00:05:02.330> like

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:02.510 
poke a hole through this can't just like

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:04.990 
poke a hole through this can't just like
rush<00:05:02.990> up<00:05:03.200> and<00:05:03.380> blitz<00:05:03.620> down<00:05:03.890> say<00:05:04.580> this<00:05:04.790> gutter

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:05.000 
rush up and blitz down say this gutter

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.840 
rush up and blitz down say this gutter
runner<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:05.450> then<00:05:06.220> you<00:05:07.220> just<00:05:07.370> have<00:05:07.520> an<00:05:07.610> open

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
runner and then you just have an open

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:09.130 
runner and then you just have an open
lane<00:05:08.030> like<00:05:08.270> there's<00:05:08.419> nowhere<00:05:08.720> you<00:05:08.840> can<00:05:08.870> really

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
lane like there's nowhere you can really

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.760 
lane like there's nowhere you can really
blitz<00:05:09.440> and<00:05:09.560> open<00:05:09.800> up<00:05:09.860> Elaine<00:05:10.180> except<00:05:11.180> for

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:11.770 
blitz and open up Elaine except for

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.830 
blitz and open up Elaine except for
these<00:05:12.770> sideline<00:05:13.220> guys<00:05:13.400> and<00:05:13.669> then<00:05:14.390> even<00:05:14.660> then

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
these sideline guys and then even then

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.620 
these sideline guys and then even then
you're<00:05:14.990> holding<00:05:15.230> them<00:05:15.320> to<00:05:15.440> a<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:15.710> died<00:05:15.860> block

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
you're holding them to a one died block

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.010 
you're holding them to a one died block
also<00:05:17.630> because<00:05:18.560> it's<00:05:19.190> not<00:05:19.370> columns<00:05:19.760> it's<00:05:20.090> it's

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
also because it's not columns it's it's

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.290 
also because it's not columns it's it's
kind<00:05:21.410> of<00:05:21.470> side<00:05:21.680> to<00:05:21.800> side<00:05:21.919> like<00:05:22.100> this<00:05:22.300> this

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
kind of side to side like this this

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.190 
kind of side to side like this this
opens<00:05:23.690> up<00:05:23.780> the<00:05:23.990> possibility<00:05:24.830> for<00:05:25.190> on<00:05:25.460> a<00:05:25.490> blitz

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
opens up the possibility for on a blitz

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.020 
opens up the possibility for on a blitz
this<00:05:27.200> character<00:05:27.580> they're<00:05:28.580> all<00:05:28.700> your<00:05:28.850> gutter

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
this character they're all your gutter

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:32.970 
this character they're all your gutter
runners<00:05:29.360> are<00:05:30.010> free<00:05:31.010> to<00:05:31.130> fly<00:05:31.160> on<00:05:31.520> to<00:05:31.550> the<00:05:31.730> ball

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:32.980 
runners are free to fly on to the ball

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:38.380 
runners are free to fly on to the ball
so<00:05:33.980> this<00:05:34.190> is<00:05:34.220> a<00:05:34.370> very<00:05:34.760> good<00:05:36.610> defense<00:05:37.610> you<00:05:38.240> could

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
so this is a very good defense you could

00:05:38.390 --> 00:06:00.070 
so this is a very good defense you could
do<00:05:38.479> a<00:05:38.510> lot<00:05:38.630> worse<00:05:38.810> than<00:05:39.550> set<00:05:40.550> up<00:05:40.640> like<00:05:40.790> this

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.749 

looking<00:06:01.080> at<00:06:01.199> the<00:06:01.259> wood<00:06:01.380> elves<00:06:01.530> offense<00:06:04.759> and

looking at the wood elves offense and

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:10.629 
looking at the wood elves offense and
this<00:06:05.940> is<00:06:06.120> I<00:06:08.150> guess<00:06:09.150> pretty<00:06:09.360> standard<00:06:09.750> stuff

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:10.639 
this is I guess pretty standard stuff

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:15.680 
this is I guess pretty standard stuff
she<00:06:11.639> has<00:06:11.759> catchers<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:14.210> positions<00:06:15.210> do<00:06:15.419> so<00:06:15.570> I

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:15.690 
she has catchers and positions do so I

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:16.760 
she has catchers and positions do so I
don't<00:06:15.840> know<00:06:15.900> why<00:06:16.020> this<00:06:16.080> guy's<00:06:16.410> over<00:06:16.650> here
