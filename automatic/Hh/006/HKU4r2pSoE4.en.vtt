00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.269
 hey 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.070
 Welcome back to Pixel Kitsch today 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.960
 after a long time again with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.869
 useless hardware and we look 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:49.350
 Today, a small post out 

00:00:45.869 --> 00:00:52.500
 has the red rich china reached at 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.570
 me in the gbb coal from the home 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.760
 The device comes and is sold 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:03.059
 mainly via aliexpress 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.640
 about 20 to 30 euros to europe 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.090
 to your home is found in this 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:12.000
 beautiful shapely packaging and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.439
 includes something right first 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.230
 unattractive and whether from foil the 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.260
 gbb choir is packed in the portfolio and 

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.080
 is delivered with a two-piece 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:27.420
 black and white user manual resp 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.390
 warranty card this instruction needs 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.820
 Of course no one ever does one 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.480
 original nintendo gameboy color used 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.290
 but as a side dish that's okay 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:41.790
 yes then we see everything in here 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.950
 Of course, beautiful black and white does not 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.550
 great readable for people without 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:50.580
 Chinese is familiar but we pick 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:56.280
 in the device times out of his film and 

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:59.280
 seeing as it is actually almost 1 to 1 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.780
 1 clone of the original from nintendo is 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.299
 also available in different 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.090
 colors and also has the same 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.060
 Controls are mounted in the coarse 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 standard 188 games loud packaging 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.680
 but in reality they are far behind 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.720
 less so some titles are double 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 As you can see here the great 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.519
 spelling 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.709
 marco I am fascinating how to get 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.299
 something just adapted and still 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.489
 at the same time a completely new one 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:28.590
 So product can create Chinese 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.930
 Engineering at the highest level 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.000
 the pressure points of the steering wheel in the 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.409
 Railway are not bad so often 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.329
 will be a little about the crossbar 

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:38.670
 But I found it a total to 

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:41.040
 play very well all the modules were 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.500
 By the way, also recognized tetris duck 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.750
 Tales service and what I have in the last one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.690
 Time has played everything easily 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.700
 works on the device what you 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.440
 of course, here is the 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.840
 volume control one side of the power 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.150
 button of another page and also the one 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.310
 link connection this works too 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.519
 actually with the original nintendo 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.489
 Gameboy color is connected as you can find here 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.440
 see tetris one- shot and the clou 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.390
 On the device the display is simple 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.220
 This is also light for many 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.090
 certainly the main reason for this 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:15.299
 device to buy 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.190
 without modification you can do that too 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:19.260
 play in the dark under the comforter 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.209
 Fantastic about it now once in the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.150
 Compare the original from the house 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:25.380
 Nintendo has a similar form 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.150
 maybe a chicken and a title 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.730
 Otherwise, the construction is but in total 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.130
 very very identical 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.049
 can see in him is the link 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.400
 connection also a same place and 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:37.079
 the original cable from home 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:40.769
 nintendo is here to be perfect 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:43.139
 purpose the display of the gb balco lohr is 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:45.150
 a little compressed so the picture is 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:46.889
 a little bit compressed 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.379
 now in operation but not so much 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.090
 the direct comparison 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:54.590
 many have also mocked that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:56.450
 or complains that forgive 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.950
 the device and probably play a tick too 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.480
 This is happening quickly 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.330
 do not play great negative 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.980
 noticed and link mode drops the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.319
 apparently not at all anymore 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.720
 great on the link 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.430
 makes for a reasonable 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.620
 Synchronization with the original device 

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.680
 there no longer falls on the tempo then 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.200
 I think the gwb polo is from the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:22.010
 home comes for 20 to a maximum of 30 euros 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:24.770
 porto a good investment who on the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:27.320
 looking for a good game boy clown 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:29.030
 is backlit is using 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:30.470
 the link of my opinion after really 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:32.930
 happy i already have some 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.490
 time gambled and am for a copied 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:37.030
 gets very satisfied with it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:37.030
 have fun with it 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.000
