if the shifter on your car has gotten
loose<00:00:02.610> or<00:00:03.090> if<00:00:03.120> it<00:00:03.659> won't<00:00:04.140> shift<00:00:04.380> at<00:00:04.650> all<00:00:04.799> into

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
loose or if it won't shift at all into

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.579 
loose or if it won't shift at all into
gear<00:00:05.940> you<00:00:06.450> can<00:00:06.480> see<00:00:06.750> inside<00:00:07.049> of<00:00:07.109> that<00:00:07.319> white

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
gear you can see inside of that white

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.200 
gear you can see inside of that white
hole<00:00:07.890> it<00:00:08.490> looks<00:00:08.550> like<00:00:08.790> there<00:00:08.940> should<00:00:09.120> be

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
hole it looks like there should be

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.850 
hole it looks like there should be
something<00:00:09.450> between<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:10.139> white<00:00:10.320> piece<00:00:10.590> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
something between the white piece and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.070 
something between the white piece and
the<00:00:11.130> stick<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.179> actually<00:00:12.540> shifts<00:00:12.840> the<00:00:12.900> gears

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
the stick that actually shifts the gears

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.959 
the stick that actually shifts the gears
and<00:00:13.380> that's<00:00:13.500> called<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.860> collet<00:00:14.340> so<00:00:14.730> if<00:00:14.820> your

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
and that's called a collet so if your

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.689 
and that's called a collet so if your
shift<00:00:15.179> collet<00:00:15.509> has<00:00:15.630> gone<00:00:15.839> bad<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.550> you<00:00:17.550> go<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
shift collet has gone bad and you go to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:18.680 
shift collet has gone bad and you go to
the<00:00:17.820> auto<00:00:17.940> parts<00:00:18.029> store<00:00:18.240> they're<00:00:18.480> going<00:00:18.510> to

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
the auto parts store they're going to

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.640 
the auto parts store they're going to
say<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:18.930> want<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.140> sell<00:00:19.320> you<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.470> whole

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
say they want to sell you the whole

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.040 
say they want to sell you the whole
cable<00:00:19.890> for<00:00:20.279> $200<00:00:20.939> rather<00:00:21.539> than<00:00:21.750> sell<00:00:21.930> you<00:00:22.020> a

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
cable for $200 rather than sell you a

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.599 
cable for $200 rather than sell you a
little<00:00:22.289> tiny<00:00:22.439> piece<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.920> hold<00:00:23.100> it<00:00:23.220> back<00:00:23.430> in

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
little tiny piece to hold it back in

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.640 
little tiny piece to hold it back in
place<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.060> what<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.539> like<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:25.050> is<00:00:25.260> build<00:00:25.439> my

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
place so what I like to do is build my

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.490 
place so what I like to do is build my
own<00:00:26.119> step<00:00:27.119> one<00:00:27.420> of<00:00:27.449> course<00:00:27.900> is<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.260> want<00:00:28.439> to

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
own step one of course is you want to

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.259 
own step one of course is you want to
measure<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.859> out<00:00:29.070> make<00:00:29.609> sure<00:00:29.640> that<00:00:29.939> you<00:00:30.090> know

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
measure it out make sure that you know

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.849 
measure it out make sure that you know
exactly<00:00:30.449> what<00:00:30.929> size<00:00:30.960> you're<00:00:31.320> getting<00:00:31.410> and

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
exactly what size you're getting and

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.940 
exactly what size you're getting and
also<00:00:32.099> look<00:00:32.279> at<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> pin<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.149> the

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
also look at the pin that the the

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.290 
also look at the pin that the the
bushing<00:00:34.950> is<00:00:35.040> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.250> go<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> to<00:00:35.910> because<00:00:36.210> it

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
bushing is going to go on to because it

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.119 
bushing is going to go on to because it
might<00:00:36.480> have<00:00:36.690> a<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:37.110> groove<00:00:37.350> in<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.950> this

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
might have a little groove in it in this

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.010 
might have a little groove in it in this
case<00:00:38.309> you<00:00:38.489> can<00:00:38.610> put<00:00:38.640> a<00:00:38.790> little<00:00:39.239> circle<00:00:39.629> clip<00:00:39.840> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
case you can put a little circle clip on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.360 
case you can put a little circle clip on
it<00:00:40.050> some<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.440> them<00:00:40.530> have<00:00:40.680> more<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> ball<00:00:41.160> and

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
it some of them have more of a ball and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.830 
it some of them have more of a ball and
socket<00:00:41.700> joint<00:00:41.730> in<00:00:42.270> which<00:00:42.450> case<00:00:42.629> you'll<00:00:42.809> have

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
socket joint in which case you'll have

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.440 
socket joint in which case you'll have
to<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.110> more<00:00:43.320> creative<00:00:43.559> I've<00:00:44.520> had<00:00:45.090> success

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
to be more creative I've had success

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.100 
to be more creative I've had success
using<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:47.030> removable<00:00:48.030> fuel<00:00:48.239> line<00:00:48.539> fitting<00:00:48.960> for

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
using a removable fuel line fitting for

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.600 
using a removable fuel line fitting for
that<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.500> get<00:00:49.680> shock<00:00:49.890> absorber<00:00:50.280> bushings

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
that so I get shock absorber bushings

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
that so I get shock absorber bushings
from<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.820> help<00:00:50.969> section<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.539> store<00:00:51.870> where

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
from the help section of the store where

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.720 
from the help section of the store where
you<00:00:52.440> can<00:00:52.559> find<00:00:52.710> just<00:00:52.890> about<00:00:53.039> anything<00:00:53.520> you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
you can find just about anything you

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.770 
you can find just about anything you
need<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.300> then<00:00:55.760> get<00:00:56.760> some<00:00:56.969> washers<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.600> there

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
need and then get some washers in there

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.970 
need and then get some washers in there
I'm<00:00:57.930> going<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.109> put<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.230> washer<00:00:58.559> on<00:00:58.649> each<00:00:58.800> side

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
I'm going to put a washer on each side

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.049 
I'm going to put a washer on each side
so<00:00:59.010> it<00:00:59.190> kind<00:00:59.340> of<00:00:59.430> sandwich<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> rubber

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
so it kind of sandwich the rubber

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.299 
so it kind of sandwich the rubber
bushing<00:01:00.480> over<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:00.780> plastic<00:01:01.230> end<00:01:01.800> piece<00:01:02.100> to

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
bushing over the plastic end piece to

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:03.650 
bushing over the plastic end piece to
keep<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.670> in<00:01:02.789> there<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.059> keep<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.300> safe<00:01:03.570> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
keep it in there and keep it safe and

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.509 
keep it in there and keep it safe and
then<00:01:04.170> put<00:01:04.350> some<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.559> these<00:01:04.680> little<00:01:04.949> e<00:01:05.010> clips<00:01:05.309> on

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
then put some of these little e clips on

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.570 
then put some of these little e clips on
the<00:01:05.610> end<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.890> hold<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.130> place<00:01:08.280> and

the end of it to hold it in place and

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.190 
the end of it to hold it in place and
just<00:01:08.640> permanently<00:01:09.270> affixed<00:01:09.659> it<00:01:09.930> you<00:01:10.049> might

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
just permanently affixed it you might

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.719 
just permanently affixed it you might
have<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.409> get<00:01:10.500> creative<00:01:10.710> with<00:01:10.979> zip<00:01:11.159> ties<00:01:11.189> or

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
have to get creative with zip ties or

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.000 
have to get creative with zip ties or
duct<00:01:11.909> tape<00:01:11.939> or<00:01:12.330> baling<00:01:12.600> wire<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.080> something<00:01:13.290> to

make it work on your car depending on

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.620 
make it work on your car depending on
how<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.930> works<00:01:16.310> this<00:01:17.310> is<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.549> Ford<00:01:17.909> Focus<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.479> as

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
how it works this is a Ford Focus so as

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.070 
how it works this is a Ford Focus so as
you<00:01:18.750> take<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:20.270> shock<00:01:21.270> absorber<00:01:21.600> bushing<00:01:21.960> and

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
you take the shock absorber bushing and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170 
you take the shock absorber bushing and
an<00:01:22.619> exacto<00:01:23.130> knife<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:23.490> want<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.880> use<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.000> really

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
an exacto knife we want to use a really

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.179 
an exacto knife we want to use a really
sharp<00:01:24.479> blade<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.990> just<00:01:25.380> cut<00:01:25.530> it<00:01:25.560> down<00:01:25.799> until

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
sharp blade and just cut it down until

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.590 
sharp blade and just cut it down until
you've<00:01:26.280> got<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> circle<00:01:26.970> or<00:01:27.150> in<00:01:27.270> this<00:01:27.390> case<00:01:27.540> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
you've got a circle or in this case a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.469 
you've got a circle or in this case a
kind<00:01:27.840> of<00:01:27.869> a<00:01:27.960> crappy<00:01:28.290> semicircle<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.610> close<00:01:30.450> to

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
kind of a crappy semicircle but close to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.950 
kind of a crappy semicircle but close to
the<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.900> shape<00:01:31.229> then<00:01:31.829> you<00:01:31.920> put<00:01:32.070> a<00:01:32.250> washer<00:01:32.670> on

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:32.960 
the right shape then you put a washer on

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.359 
the right shape then you put a washer on
make<00:01:33.960> sure<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.200> put<00:01:34.380> a<00:01:34.409> lot<00:01:34.650> of<00:01:34.799> grease<00:01:35.070> on<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
make sure you put a lot of grease on it

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.080 
make sure you put a lot of grease on it
I<00:01:35.670> think<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> give<00:01:36.930> it<00:01:36.960> some<00:01:37.170> long<00:01:37.350> life

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
I think just to give it some long life

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.700 
I think just to give it some long life
then<00:01:39.090> we<00:01:39.299> grease<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.020> rubber<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> shove<00:01:40.619> it

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
then we grease the rubber and shove it

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.590 
then we grease the rubber and shove it
in<00:01:40.799> the<00:01:40.890> hole<00:01:40.939> that's<00:01:41.939> what<00:01:42.060> she<00:01:42.210> said<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
in the hole that's what she said and

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.520 
in the hole that's what she said and
then<00:01:43.200> we<00:01:43.380> put<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.770> in<00:01:43.979> place<00:01:44.159> and<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:45.530> one

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
then we put that in place and then one

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.020 
then we put that in place and then one
more<00:01:46.680> washer<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.250> top<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.729> that<00:01:48.920> and<00:01:50.030> after

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
more washer on top of that and after

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730 
more washer on top of that and after
that<00:01:51.240> we're<00:01:51.630> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.840> use<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.079> pliers<00:01:52.350> and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
that we're going to use the pliers and

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.260 
that we're going to use the pliers and
clip<00:01:53.040> the<00:01:53.189> little<00:01:53.430> snap<00:01:53.610> clip<00:01:53.850> on<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.060> end<00:01:54.090> of

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
clip the little snap clip on the end of

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.630 
clip the little snap clip on the end of
its<00:01:54.420> snap<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.070> my<00:01:56.130> case<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.579> is

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
its snap and now in my case this is

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.920 
its snap and now in my case this is
perfect<00:01:57.119> this<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.270> probably<00:01:57.600> better<00:01:57.780> than

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
perfect this is probably better than

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.810 
perfect this is probably better than
whatever<00:01:58.290> came<00:01:58.560> from<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> factory<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.399> your

case<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.719> might<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.930> to<00:02:01.049> use<00:02:01.170> some<00:02:01.200> more

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
case you might have to use some more

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.590 
case you might have to use some more
creative<00:02:01.890> methods<00:02:02.250> of<00:02:02.430> duct<00:02:03.090> tape<00:02:03.180> baling
