power<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:06.250> the<00:02:06.369> last<00:02:06.670> thing<00:02:07.060> is<00:02:07.660> underneath

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:08.320 
power and the last thing is underneath

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.280 
power and the last thing is underneath
this<00:02:08.560> big<00:02:08.890> fan<00:02:09.310> and<00:02:09.610> vent<00:02:09.880> system<00:02:10.300> here<00:02:10.509> is<00:02:11.020> a

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
this big fan and vent system here is a

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.949 
this big fan and vent system here is a
special<00:02:11.890> thing<00:02:12.130> for<00:02:12.550> the<00:02:12.700> slim<00:02:13.420> version<00:02:13.900> of

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
special thing for the slim version of

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.940 
special thing for the slim version of
the<00:02:14.050> 360<00:02:14.709> they<00:02:15.610> provide<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.330> GPU<00:02:16.959> and<00:02:17.560> the<00:02:17.770> CPU

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
the 360 they provide the GPU and the CPU

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.570 
the 360 they provide the GPU and the CPU
under<00:02:18.880> one<00:02:19.120> single<00:02:19.570> die<00:02:19.989> in<00:02:20.380> there<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.890> they

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
under one single die in there and they

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.190 
under one single die in there and they
shrunk<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.030> down<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.420> it's<00:02:22.540> only<00:02:22.630> 65

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
shrunk it down so it's only 65

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.280 
shrunk it down so it's only 65
nanometers<00:02:23.830> so<00:02:24.370> that<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.790> theory<00:02:25.150> should<00:02:26.140> keep

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
nanometers so that in theory should keep

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
nanometers so that in theory should keep
everything<00:02:26.590> nice<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.280> cool<00:02:27.519> and<00:02:27.910> easily
