00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
features of the Kinect and gave us the

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.840 
features of the Kinect and gave us the
answer<00:02:01.870> which<00:02:02.560> was<00:02:02.860> what<00:02:03.190> he<00:02:03.280> said<00:02:03.310> and<00:02:03.760> I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850

way now spawns a pretty big question

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.589 
way now spawns a pretty big question
that<00:03:39.400> and<00:03:39.639> a<00:03:39.700> lot<00:03:40.000> of<00:03:40.150> people<00:03:40.329> are<00:03:40.420> probably

that and a lot of people are probably

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:42.270 
that and a lot of people are probably
gonna<00:03:40.810> be<00:03:40.959> begging<00:03:41.379> Microsoft<00:03:41.829> to<00:03:41.980> do<00:03:42.099> this

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
gonna be begging Microsoft to do this

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.729 
gonna be begging Microsoft to do this
will<00:03:42.730> they<00:03:42.909> put<00:03:43.120> out<00:03:43.239> an<00:03:43.389> Xbox<00:03:43.840> one<00:03:44.019> bundle<00:03:44.440> at

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
will they put out an Xbox one bundle at

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.039 
will they put out an Xbox one bundle at
a<00:03:44.769> cheaper<00:03:45.280> price<00:03:45.669> without<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.540> Kinect<00:03:46.900> in

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
a cheaper price without the Kinect in

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:48.659 
a cheaper price without the Kinect in
the<00:03:47.290> bundle<00:03:47.590> because<00:03:47.889> now<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.129> connects

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:48.669 
the bundle because now the connects

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:51.330 
the bundle because now the connects
really<00:03:48.910> isn't<00:03:49.329> a<00:03:49.690> requirement<00:03:50.169> well<00:03:50.889> with

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
really isn't a requirement well with

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.009 
really isn't a requirement well with
that<00:03:51.519> being<00:03:51.699> said<00:03:51.910> I<00:03:52.150> don't<00:03:52.419> think<00:03:52.629> that<00:03:52.840> this

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:53.019 
that being said I don't think that this

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:55.379 
that being said I don't think that this
is<00:03:53.230> going<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.620> happen<00:03:54.099> or<00:03:54.280> see<00:03:54.669> it<00:03:54.730> in<00:03:55.000> Acer

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:55.389 
is going to happen or see it in Acer

is going to happen or see it in Acer
foreseeable<00:03:56.230> future<00:03:56.680> because<00:03:57.310> they've

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 
foreseeable future because they've

00:03:57.819 --> 00:03:59.309 
foreseeable future because they've
always<00:03:58.060> said<00:03:58.389> in<00:03:58.540> the<00:03:58.659> past<00:03:58.900> that<00:03:59.109> their

00:03:59.309 --> 00:03:59.319 
always said in the past that their

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:01.589 
always said in the past that their
connects<00:03:59.709> major<00:04:00.250> flaw<00:04:00.669> was<00:04:00.879> the<00:04:01.030> fact<00:04:01.269> that<00:04:01.389> it

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:01.599 
connects major flaw was the fact that it

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.659 
connects major flaw was the fact that it
didn't<00:04:01.900> comes<00:04:02.169> standard<00:04:02.590> developers<00:04:03.400> don't

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
want to waste resources on something

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.069 
want to waste resources on something
that<00:04:05.829> very<00:04:06.280> few<00:04:06.519> people<00:04:06.579> have<00:04:06.879> and<00:04:07.359> very<00:04:07.840> few

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:08.079 
that very few people have and very few

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.439 
that very few people have and very few
people<00:04:08.260> use<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.159> with<00:04:09.430> the<00:04:09.669> Kinect<00:04:10.090> being

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:10.449 
people use so with the Kinect being

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.020 
people use so with the Kinect being
bundled<00:04:10.959> into<00:04:11.169> the<00:04:11.560> Xbox<00:04:11.769> one<00:04:12.099> bundle<00:04:12.340> every

bundled into the Xbox one bundle every

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.000 
bundled into the Xbox one bundle every
developer<00:04:13.540> can<00:04:13.720> say<00:04:13.930> every<00:04:14.440> household<00:04:14.889> that

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
developer can say every household that

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.399 
developer can say every household that
has<00:04:15.310> an<00:04:15.519> Xbox<00:04:15.909> one<00:04:16.060> has<00:04:16.599> a<00:04:16.659> Kinect<00:04:17.229> and

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
has an Xbox one has a Kinect and

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:18.990 
has an Xbox one has a Kinect and
therefore<00:04:17.829> they<00:04:18.010> can<00:04:18.190> choose<00:04:18.489> whether<00:04:18.729> or<00:04:18.880> not

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
therefore they can choose whether or not

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.569 
therefore they can choose whether or not
to<00:04:19.090> use<00:04:19.750> it<00:04:19.780> in<00:04:20.109> their<00:04:20.289> video<00:04:20.590> game<00:04:20.799> or<00:04:21.130> not<00:04:21.370> and

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
to use it in their video game or not and

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:23.460 
to use it in their video game or not and
develop<00:04:22.030> the<00:04:22.150> games<00:04:22.389> with<00:04:22.720> it<00:04:22.870> connect<00:04:23.229> in

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
develop the games with it connect in

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.140 
develop the games with it connect in
mind<00:04:23.740> that<00:04:24.070> was<00:04:24.159> their<00:04:24.280> biggest<00:04:24.490> fault<00:04:24.880> worth

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
mind that was their biggest fault worth

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.490 
mind that was their biggest fault worth
to<00:04:25.270> connect<00:04:25.570> the<00:04:25.659> first<00:04:25.840> time<00:04:26.110> around<00:04:26.260> because

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
to connect the first time around because

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.770 
to connect the first time around because
it<00:04:26.979> was<00:04:27.130> an<00:04:27.250> optional<00:04:27.760> purchase<00:04:28.240> and<00:04:28.419> not<00:04:28.659> too

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
it was an optional purchase and not too

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.450 
it was an optional purchase and not too
many<00:04:28.870> people<00:04:29.080> did<00:04:29.349> purchase<00:04:29.530> it<00:04:29.830> so<00:04:30.010> why<00:04:30.220> would

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
many people did purchase it so why would

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.850 
many people did purchase it so why would
one<00:04:30.669> waste<00:04:31.150> resources<00:04:31.810> on<00:04:32.080> something<00:04:32.500> that's

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860
