00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.610
 most summer houses 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 but on any of the archer complementary 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.310
 display except where it is necessary and a 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:24.449
 between ipod mobile device and 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:28.199
 iphone on other devices I donâ€™t know 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:31.199
 there is anxiety so how to do such 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.920
 we need this program in your 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.530
 designer 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.600
 inteko designer so there are free 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 programs it is not optimized for 5 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:46.170
 iphone and has a few of these intro ie 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:48.210
 one page and here will be oh what have they 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.960
 very much stick in this thing which he 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.960
 came here 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:59.280
 we introduce but I will use in principle 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.829
 I can do this only 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.210
 next program but i will 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.949
 enjoy the paid version of net 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:08.460
 found it will be better seen that she 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.860
 optimized how to make such 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.869
 so here you will have a list of control 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.689
 if you bought a paid or free one 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 the same push plus you will have zero 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.119
 most likely not not exactly nothing will 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:23.850
 Click plus so here in my paid 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.780
 version is the bottom such a thing is all 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.600
 by parameter 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:32.820
 and here it is by category so I choose 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:35.729
 simple and make the skin like mine this 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.790
 need to express your paid blindness she 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:43.020
 template libanova will already be downloaded 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.329

 select entries here write title 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.540
 channel for example like mine here 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.540
 in Russian hour 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:59.490
 how many crosses 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.860
 it's kind of weird at Google 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.709
 if you subscribe subscribe with 0 0 0 

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:10.090
 0 well, nothing comes and then those 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.760
 who subscribed for the whole 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:20.560
 this hour here we write represent 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:24.880
 for example represents and then come 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:32.709
 these are all pis pis ma so everything is ready so 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:37.290
 let's see what happened next 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:40.989
 show you how to replace music on your computer 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.790
 program as well as the background I am only one 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.390
 free video editor is him and he 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.519
 free 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.100
 just one he paid costs $ 5 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.959
 if I'm not mistaken but good program I 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.790
 I advise you to buy 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:03:08.650
 you will do this pretty 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:03:11.500
 serious kind of mantra steel and because 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:15.270
 that you do not hold the limit should not 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:21.840
 fall is not the other way around 

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:24.180
 Launch it and so here look 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.830
 what happened next we can 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.300
 change the position of the text for example here 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.430
 a half friends we can change for example 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.850
 here you can reset 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.440
 further the text color has limits this 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:41.220
 the most gentle white seems to me 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:48.750
 decides the font and audio here you can turn on 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.500
 music from the most defects, too, and he breathe 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.500
 here is the type 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:03.319
 I did not get here it will sante 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:08.480
 fx and so on we press export here 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:11.360
 you can have minutes and then choose 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.239
 1280 to 720 format connect 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.180
 here we select again the settings and you can 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:19.120
 whether to keep this 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.970
 in the camera in the camera roll that is 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.770
 film press export then write 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.680
 opponent paul wait 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:30.370
 or close the apple console 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:36.890

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:45.290
 Export to abruptly leave and open our 

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:54.919

 Well, here we have this and that 

00:04:54.919 --> 00:05:01.430

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:23.920
 how is he different music here and we choose 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:26.200

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:30.400
