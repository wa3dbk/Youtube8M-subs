00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.299
 good staff is the game is teaching how 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:09.510
 is to create no application so that the 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.820
 computer shut down alone for a while 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.889
 is programmed by you 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.300
 there are two ways to do this is 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:20.130
 make application sp and the other by cm 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.529
 first goal he teaches how to do 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.779
 application is that using the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.990
 notes with the first you open the block 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.429
 of notes 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.429
 here you will write the following 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:40.239
 the shot down beauty after you 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.010
 type - s which means that the 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:45.820
 computer is going to be turned off is to 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.519
 turning off the computer is less effective than 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:52.930
 means that any application that 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:55.210
 is open and going to close in the 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.670
 computer will shut down it will force it 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.469
 shutting down even while having applications 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.479
 open and less having what is the time in 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.909
 case in seconds in case I'm going to create 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.100
 so here equivalent to 10 minutes it 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:12.399
 noticed that they were off 10 minutes 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:18.240
 so I'm going to plant 600 seconds 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:18.240
 done that you're coming to save file right 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:30.100
 Then you 'll put the name on my 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:36.740
 case example I'll put with a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:39.290
 off at 10 hit point at the end has 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.890
 to be barcita to create and apply the 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:46.040
 apps made this wine you save 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.430
 He already saved 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:53.540
 here is the application hang up 10 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.310
 clicks it's clicking every time i 

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:57.860
 I saw what I said that the computer 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.850
 in 10 minutes you can put in 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.740
 in 15 minutes in an hour you put the 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.800
 amount of time you want 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.850
 in case here the button 10 minutes by clicking 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.970
 on here 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:13.040
 the message will appear saying 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.120
 that windows will be shut down in 10 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.060
 minutes 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.110
 this is a way of doing the other way 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.640
 to do is by the cm of that you come 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:28.090
 here you will open type here by car 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.090
 Internet 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.170
 You're going to dictate the same thing as me. 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.500
 I explained to make the application there 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.500
 alone 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.130
 and will put the time here also in the 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.380
 if I'm going to count the 60 seconds here 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:56.250
 that is equivalent to one minute and it is only 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.900
 press enter it will already show the 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.680
 message that will be turned off in a 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.580
 minute 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:07.160
 Good people, I would hope so. 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.160
 I liked it and for today it's just
