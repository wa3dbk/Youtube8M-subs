00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.500
 In the empty space all echoes 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.440
 Silence a stingray breaks through 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.080
 Shadows on the wall are undiscovered 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.840
 Ever since I removed my memories 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.540
 On the empty road all wet 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.760
 Love with rain is washed away 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.220
 I do not expect anything 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.260
 I'm just looking forward to a new day 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.800
 How many times have I spoken? 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.780
 that I'm okay, that I've forgotten you 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.800
 but the truth is undeniable 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 and, really, really, you really do me a favor 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.120
 And the empty bed now calls me 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.500
 al 'I dream of my dreams 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.120
 because my dreams brought me here 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.460
 and the only society has become to me 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.000
 How many times have I been deceived 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.640
 with the guilty I replaced you 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.760
 because you are the only one you are right 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.340
 and really, they did, you really forgive me 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.160
 How many times have I asked for you? 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.620
 hoping to meet you accidentally 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.820
 but the truth is invincible 

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.740
 and really, really, really does not have you 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.820
 and really, really, really does not have you 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.460
 ... You're not here ... 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.540
 How many times have I spoken? 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.020
 that I'm okay, that I've forgotten you 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.740
 al 'istitna is undeniable 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.140
 and you really, really, really do me a favor 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.400
 How many times have I asked for you? 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.940
 hoping to meet you accidentally 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.120
 but the truth is invincible 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.080
 and really, really, really does not have you 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.880
 and really, really, really does not have you 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.100
 and really 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.140
 really does not have you
