00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.229

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.850
 spend and spend the most 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.859
 quickly to be able to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170
 continue to bring this series 

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:37.340
 however I will start with a series of 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.219
 minecraft that will be with modes in 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.640
 single player and another as a player that 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.829
 will be in principle my sister 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.600
 Then you'll see we get into 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.299
 principle so you go to the streets 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:02:01.899
 see but in principle I will start with a 

00:01:50.299 --> 00:02:01.899
 series of mote thrown day 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.750
 in principle I will start a series of 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.210
 of minecraft modes after we go 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.150
 show the mote thani you will choose 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.550
 what is the way you want to come today less 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.700
 from what is beach fashion outside because it is 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.390
 fashion that is for you as you have seen and 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.940
 off but not responsible then biato 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.820
 party that says it all 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:41.840
 It starts there, because it will make us sick. 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:46.790
 here this is what here do you think 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:51.640
 here's our fifth line of scream here 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:54.700
 with the branches we have that is always good 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.290
 then we have here these magnificent works 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.160
 However, I did not change the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.390
 View 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.070
 They know that women is that they are good 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:03.470
 so pay and culture 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.250
 I basically help the interior of the 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:09.590
 home and will then have a stone and 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.040
 exactly this made these 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.170
 pebbles these flowers inhabited this 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.900
 here came home the house have done 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.600
 this morality here was simply to 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:22.070
 close and this of the outside world does not 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.900
 I knew a good idea is in 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.820
 This is where the yard will be . 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.060
 Our animals, people, let's get 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:33.700
 then do creation and plant let's 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:39.700
 show our rescuing our house 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:42.799
 Let's show the happiness of me. 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.140
 How can you see our house is like this? 

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:47.150
 you hold out so the athlete will do as he is 

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:51.019
 Do you go home? 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.840
 if you do not have a personal entrance and calm 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.600
 We have an entrance here, we walked. 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.610
 playing with the pistons then it loads 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:05.150
 this one and take a driveway home 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:11.930
 underground and has built the buraka 

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:14.459
 trump together then you can come in 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.660
 alexandre who will be there with you no 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.699
 being nothing and now that a very touch 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.530
 Wonderful at midnight because it was not 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.470
 we see nothing takes away the houses because it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:28.530
 very dark we made here what 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.430
 makes the entrance and being here alone date 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.050
 was not 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.789
 I did not ask how I did it says 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.280
 no longer remember 

00:04:32.789 --> 00:04:37.620
 already no longer well done that I did this 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:44.250
 but it was funny but to watch 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:45.900
 So you 're so dark now, have you? 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.009
 calm our classes must be able to do 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.169
 that counts 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:50.729
 so there are still many lines missing here 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:52.470
 down the stairs 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.930
 we are thinking of doing these 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:57.660
 little things and we plant here in our house 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:05.340
 it's all dark however byasen there was 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:06.750
 not so great said that he observed in this 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.330
 long 

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.849
 this was one more invention of mine 

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:14.940
 I remembered the step because we do not have 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:17.490
 so until all lit up and made 

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:19.020
 these links all behind the 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:27.630
 walls you do not even want to know what's going on. 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:28.949
 going back and the huge are 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.590
 scattered on the floor to make the 

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.650
 Links but we have more magic 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.690
 we forgot to show this but we 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.080
 we have up there just us 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:45.150
 Assembly is zinha giving a bath 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:47.360
 in the green house already by the milan that is the 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.009
 bar 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.220
 We have the surprise and I'll leave the 

00:05:50.009 --> 00:05:55.889
 should present the surprise that was 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.710
 she practically did everything this 

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:05.360
 surprise then I will want to delete the 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:05.360
 light should of white ale 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:14.970
 a review is imagine what we went through 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:18.240
 Last night after building list 

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:23.100
 the time we spent doing just that only 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:27.650
 to do this was only this construction 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:30.180
 wonderful cab brought it to us that 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:38.250
 light a light anyone know what 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:41.360
 I was here with external paver 

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:44.910
 implements that these two stones 

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.790
 In fact it was everything, but we decided 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:50.490
 so here's one thing to do but the pan 

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:52.230
 was to wash and then we did this 

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:56.730
 building alone 

00:06:52.230 --> 00:06:59.910
 we carry and leave here a little hand 

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:01.620
 soon as the argument goes that we go by 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:04.080
 a stove that was supposed to look more like 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:06.420
 with real life usually hands on 

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.210
 top of the end but football does not 

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:12.240
 work that we and the weight of the stove I 

00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.780
 Well, we know why it does not work. 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:22.340
 with the stove but for what matters here 

00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.340
 in Tabuba and also did not say 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.240
 So it was 

00:07:29.630 --> 00:07:36.420
 It's a lot of things you can not try 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:41.940
 to gather lots of things but for the 

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:44.040
 sec and for salt it was only for 

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:45.620
 the orange moves before the show 

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.000
 channel 

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:50.700
 I hope you have been there and do it. 

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:54.420
 the favorite of advocating the channel 

00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:58.310
 Who is always important to me and to 

00:07:54.420 --> 00:07:58.310
 Where they just stay, vai va pis
