coverage I got it in ivory they have
light<00:02:05.100> ivory<00:02:05.399> and

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
light ivory and

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.700 
light ivory and

they have afraid I got it in ivory

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.800 
they have afraid I got it in ivory
because<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> think<00:02:08.970> it<00:02:09.060> was<00:02:09.179> that<00:02:09.330> light<00:02:09.539> ivory

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
because I think it was that light ivory

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.970 
because I think it was that light ivory
matched<00:02:10.259> my<00:02:10.730> skin<00:02:11.730> when<00:02:11.970> i<00:02:12.209> swatched<00:02:12.660> it<00:02:13.080> but

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
matched my skin when i swatched it but

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.309 
matched my skin when i swatched it but
it<00:02:14.940> really<00:02:15.120> didn't<00:02:15.480> match<00:02:15.629> my<00:02:15.870> neck<00:02:16.110> and

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
it really didn't match my neck and

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.460 
it really didn't match my neck and
everything<00:02:16.680> else<00:02:16.860> and<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.489> I<00:02:17.940> tried<00:02:18.510> out<00:02:18.840> ivory

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
everything else and so I tried out ivory

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.960 
everything else and so I tried out ivory
and<00:02:19.739> even<00:02:19.980> when<00:02:20.099> I<00:02:20.190> was<00:02:20.280> applying<00:02:20.459> it<00:02:20.730> today<00:02:20.940> I

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.240 
and even when I was applying it today I
was<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.360> looks<00:02:21.420> really<00:02:21.870> yellow<00:02:22.290> but<00:02:23.220> I

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
was like this looks really yellow but I

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.440 
was like this looks really yellow but I
think<00:02:23.640> that<00:02:23.790> it<00:02:23.879> actually<00:02:24.450> works<00:02:25.200> so<00:02:26.120> for<00:02:27.120> my
