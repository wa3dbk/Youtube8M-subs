00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
there I was doing a much more physical

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.719 
there I was doing a much more physical
job<00:01:43.610> physical<00:01:44.610> labor<00:01:45.380> use<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.409> lot<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> like

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
job physical labor use a lot of like

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.179 
job physical labor use a lot of like
heavy<00:01:48.119> impact<00:01:49.460> guns<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.840> heavy<00:01:52.229> malls

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
heavy impact guns and like heavy malls

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.990 
heavy impact guns and like heavy malls
happen<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.030> smash<00:01:54.500> pins<00:01:55.500> through<00:01:56.000> equipment

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
happen to smash pins through equipment

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.429 
happen to smash pins through equipment
and<00:01:57.119> stuff<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.420> so<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.259> was<00:01:58.380> very

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and stuff like that so it was very

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.999 
and stuff like that so it was very
physical<00:01:59.219> and<00:02:00.259> I<00:02:01.259> think<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.590> has<00:02:01.770> something

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
physical and I think that has something

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.670 
physical and I think that has something
to<00:02:02.520> do<00:02:02.700> with<00:02:02.909> a<00:02:03.180> lot<00:02:03.750> of<00:02:03.780> my<00:02:03.960> little<00:02:04.170> tweaks<00:02:04.439> and

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
to do with a lot of my little tweaks and

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.560 
to do with a lot of my little tweaks and

injuries that I had throughout this

approaching nationals from a different
standpoint<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:52.699> we're<00:03:53.699> gonna<00:03:53.790> see<00:03:53.879> what

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
standpoint and we're gonna see what

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.569 
standpoint and we're gonna see what
happens<00:03:54.540> but<00:03:54.780> I<00:03:55.109> mean<00:03:55.590> like<00:03:56.190> I<00:03:56.310> said<00:03:56.340> before

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
happens but I mean like I said before

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.659 
happens but I mean like I said before
this<00:03:57.479> whole<00:03:57.750> one<00:03:58.650> show<00:03:58.919> thing<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.340> gonna<00:03:59.459> make

00:03:59.659 --> 00:03:59.669 
this whole one show thing is gonna make

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:03.589 
this whole one show thing is gonna make
a<00:03:59.909> difference<00:04:00.359> I<00:04:00.449> think<00:04:00.479> for<00:04:01.349> me<00:04:02.599> mostly

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
a difference I think for me mostly

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.990 
a difference I think for me mostly
because<00:04:03.720> I<00:04:04.310> usually<00:04:05.310> hit<00:04:05.400> my<00:04:05.549> peak<00:04:05.790> in<00:04:05.909> the

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
because I usually hit my peak in the

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.240 
because I usually hit my peak in the
evening<00:04:06.299> show<00:04:06.479> so<00:04:06.840> whenever<00:04:07.169> I<00:04:07.319> can<00:04:07.500> only<00:04:07.620> now

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
evening show so whenever I can only now

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.099 
evening show so whenever I can only now
that<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.519> can<00:04:08.669> only<00:04:08.790> focus<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.269> the<00:04:09.479> one<00:04:09.629> show<00:04:09.870> or

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
that I can only focus on the one show or

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:11.780 
that I can only focus on the one show or
or<00:04:10.440> can<00:04:10.620> get<00:04:10.739> away<00:04:10.829> with<00:04:11.010> only<00:04:11.129> focusing<00:04:11.669> on

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
or can get away with only focusing on

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.670 
or can get away with only focusing on
the<00:04:11.909> one<00:04:12.030> show<00:04:12.299> I<00:04:12.540> think<00:04:13.109> it's<00:04:13.260> gonna<00:04:13.379> it's

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
the one show I think it's gonna it's

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.729 
the one show I think it's gonna it's
going<00:04:13.889> to<00:04:13.949> benefit<00:04:14.280> me<00:04:14.479> significantly<00:04:15.739> since

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:47.670 
myself this show it's a totally

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:48.890 
myself this show it's a totally
different<00:06:47.700> approach<00:06:48.000> that<00:06:48.330> I've<00:06:48.420> ever<00:06:48.480> taken

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
different approach that I've ever taken

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:52.310 
different approach that I've ever taken
before<00:06:49.170> but<00:06:50.150> it's<00:06:51.150> what<00:06:51.360> I<00:06:51.390> think<00:06:51.660> that's<00:06:51.840> it

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.320 
before but it's what I think that's it

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.320 
before but it's what I think that's it
could<00:06:52.710> make<00:06:52.800> the<00:06:52.860> difference<00:06:52.980> so<00:06:53.490> we're<00:06:54.210> going

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:54.330 
could make the difference so we're going

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:56.690 
could make the difference so we're going
to<00:06:54.390> give<00:06:54.480> it<00:06:54.570> a<00:06:54.660> try<00:06:54.840> and<00:06:55.050> really<00:06:55.400> do<00:06:56.400> our<00:06:56.520> best
