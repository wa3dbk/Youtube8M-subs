00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 hello people as they are there has not been 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.170
 tutorial on how to install the sql server 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.060
 2000 on windows 7 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:15.950
 good and as you will see 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.950
 I just leave in the description 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.470
 this file 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.280
 you extract it where you want it 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.060
 do 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:33.529
 and extract in my personal disk 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.529
 but before I go to 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.129
 has a folder 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.859
 we go to blogs 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.270
 let's accept good 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.350
 there we give it to finish as you will see 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.350
 I started to extract 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.810
 I have it extracted here 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.790
 while this extracts I'm going 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.660
 showing what yes as 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.570
 it's windows 7 they 're not going to give author if 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:26.420
 they will not give you directly to the point 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.690
 bat the executable this is called 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.690
 top 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.189
 will open us in this poster we are going to 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.050
 execute the program 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:39.450
 please run the program 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.750
 and we will jump directly to this 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.750
 part 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.500
 the local computer 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.110
 next 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.990
 we put some password 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:32.100
 next next and here will start to install 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.250
 this will take a few minutes 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:38.250
 yes 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:44.480
 have patience because being a 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.269
 program will not be a 100% program 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:51.410
 compatible with windows 7 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.450
 it takes a few small minutes later 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.550
 inconveniences but as you can see you can 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.710
 install there is no problem 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.770
 I'm going to pose the video and I'll come back when 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:06.050
 the injured ones we went back as you will see 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.050
 it's already finished and it's over 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.430
 be a while have the patience 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:23.329
 but the truth is that one of the best 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.019
 sqlserver that you use 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:28.219
 it helped me a lot and I installed it again 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:31.440
 because he lived in his beginning he had already 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:36.420
 done a server is far pirates 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:39.420
 and for quite some time there was already in that 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.160
 then the videos still existed my 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.230
 classroom for those who do not know was a 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:46.490
 page where a server where we could 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:49.850
 upload and download files 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:54.280
 and at that time it still worked 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:56.170
 better in the videos 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.480
 they were valid because the links 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.510
 they worked more 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:05.659
 as we see already finished 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.040
 and good and I had always used sql 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:09.799
 server 2000 and it had not worked 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.200
 then try to use again 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.100
 I could see 2000 I hope there was 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:18.919
 liked the video if there was any problem 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:22.160
 come back to watch the video delaying some 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.680
 doubt consult do not be afraid I am going to 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.860
 try to answer them if I do not have the 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:30.020
 answer I will try to see if I can 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.680
 get it in one way or another 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.780
 try to answer the questions 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:40.770
