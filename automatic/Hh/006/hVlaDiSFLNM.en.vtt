00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi to all his high tone you then 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.069
 today I present you and a 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.490
 little video on a cydia application 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:13.440
 who's called agwai who's here and who 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.870
 is very handy since there is 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.190
 especially could maybe because the 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.670
 iphone but sometimes bad memory 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:22.650
 and I think you've posted since gigabyte 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.750
 and iphone cjga also motivates me 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.869
 a lot of things well that's okay 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.740
 in fact to free him from the memory that 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.989
 used by binary codes and everything 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.460
 while they are not even used so 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.320
 basically it not tell you from memory 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.660
 it is useless so it's perfect 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.660
 but you can in this app 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:47.010
 that's it then you still ask yourself 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.469
 will just cause one question that I 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.190
 continue after you wait that this nor 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.140
 this the loading bar and after 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.270
 more important and it happens in the 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.579
 arms at all they only use you 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:02.090
 do not use so I will show you 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:10.320
 how to download this application 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:13.260
 so v1 cydia this is more of what 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:19.159
 source it is but I owe it to you 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:21.659
 prompt inserted into practice because 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.729
 when you are a lot of room and 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.290
 all my applications it's very 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.869
 bothering to see delete the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.520
 apps one every time and everything 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:38.930
 so it's rather reacted 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.930
 we are looking for yailles 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.950
 we wait 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:51.930
 at 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.730
 like me I turn on one side I am 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.230
 says gallas and they serve me to 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.960
 costumes because I do not have a lot of 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.580
 memory so that's often it's 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:10.950
 are worth of memory here is his charge this 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:17.010
 very very long unless connected 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:19.080
 no voila so you suddenly have 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.720
 strongly it depends on the sources 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.510
 that you normally have it is 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:27.020
 Pay here but of course it can be 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.720
 see free with and source 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:34.650
 but on this crash is for example low the 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.330
 source x elise i will show you the 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.180
 source like that for her added if 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.150
 so you do not have to add it 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 I think you put them a go 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:54.540
 in the winged down to the bear dance 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:01.850
 modified added and you type if there is 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:05.240
 point here live.com 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:08.740
 the party added the source but that this 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:12.580
 was everything to believe the source 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.580
 who will be this one 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.930
 here you go in the sauce there you go 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:26.829
 in tizi ouzou associates not far to seek 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.269
 like that it's pretty boring I you 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:31.750
 advise to go their search rather 

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:34.989
 and the troops and to Taiwan so you go 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.769
 this was it little tutorial on how this 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:40.329
 winter he negotiated his sleep device 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.700
 bulging for one ever to subscribe 

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:44.499
 on this video you liked and I you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.709
 say to + a plus everyone
