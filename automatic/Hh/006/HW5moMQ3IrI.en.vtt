it's an old high our panel it's well and
truly<00:00:11.670> used<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:13.019> we're<00:00:13.290> gonna<00:00:13.380> put<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.620> out<00:00:13.740> of

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
truly used so we're gonna put it out of

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.359 
truly used so we're gonna put it out of
its<00:00:13.860> misery<00:00:15.619> once<00:00:16.619> again<00:00:16.859> don't<00:00:17.070> try<00:00:17.310> this

its misery once again don't try this

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.269 
its misery once again don't try this
 at<00:00:17.760> home<00:00:18.170> the<00:00:19.189> transformer<00:00:20.189> and

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
 at home the transformer and

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:21.769 
 at home the transformer and
everything<00:00:20.550> I'm<00:00:20.640> using<00:00:20.850> here<00:00:21.180> will<00:00:21.420> kill<00:00:21.630> you

viewers so without further ado let's

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.479 
viewers so without further ado let's
turn<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:33.989> power<00:00:34.230> on<00:00:34.320> I'm<00:00:34.620> using<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> very<00:00:35.160> act

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
turn the power on I'm using a very act

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.400 
turn the power on I'm using a very act
to<00:00:35.700> bring<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> microwave<00:00:36.450> transformer<00:00:37.140> up<00:00:37.260> to

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
to bring the microwave transformer up to

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.830 
to bring the microwave transformer up to
voltage<00:00:37.739> gradually<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.730> I'm<00:00:39.300> also<00:00:39.450> wearing<00:00:39.690> a

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
voltage gradually and I'm also wearing a

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
voltage gradually and I'm also wearing a
full-face<00:00:40.050> visors<00:00:40.920> I've<00:00:41.040> just<00:00:41.280> in<00:00:41.399> case<00:00:41.610> this

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
full-face visors I've just in case this

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.810 
full-face visors I've just in case this
panel<00:00:42.149> decides<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.750> critical<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.379> rupture

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
panel decides to go critical and rupture

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.520 
panel decides to go critical and rupture
there<00:00:44.820> is<00:00:44.940> no<00:00:45.149> safety<00:00:45.570> front<00:00:45.989> on<00:00:46.170> it<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.379> just

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
there is no safety front on it it's just

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:53.779 
there is no safety front on it it's just
plate<00:00:46.860> glass<00:00:51.020> yeah<00:00:52.020> five<00:00:52.350> percent<00:00:52.890> if<00:00:53.550> your

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
plate glass yeah five percent if your

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:02.959 
plate glass yeah five percent if your
brightness<00:00:56.090> 10%<00:01:00.710> whoops<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:02.609> give<00:01:02.850> it

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
brightness 10% whoops don't give it

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:35.039 
brightness 10% whoops don't give it
Benny

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.480 

mm-hmm

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 

we've<00:01:39.000> let<00:01:39.150> us<00:01:39.270> sit<00:01:39.360> about<00:01:39.540> five<00:01:39.870> amps<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.410> the

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
we've let us sit about five amps on the

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:58.639 
we've let us sit about five amps on the
secondary

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.139 

whoops<00:01:59.649> I'm<00:01:59.799> going<00:01:59.950> to<00:02:00.009> lose<00:02:00.250> my<00:02:00.609> connection

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
whoops I'm going to lose my connection

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:09.779 
whoops I'm going to lose my connection
through<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> panel<00:02:04.200> powers<00:02:05.200> down<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.729> I

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:09.789 
through the panel powers down and I

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.900 
through the panel powers down and I
carefully<00:02:10.119> remove<00:02:10.599> the<00:02:10.629> y-sustain<00:02:10.989> wires<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
carefully remove the y-sustain wires and

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.670 
carefully remove the y-sustain wires and
exceed<00:02:13.239> burning<00:02:13.629> through<00:02:13.870> down<00:02:14.080> there<00:02:14.110> I

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
exceed burning through down there I

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.150 
exceed burning through down there I
don't<00:02:15.040> want<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.370> lose<00:02:15.580> the<00:02:16.480> envelope<00:02:17.379> just<00:02:17.799> yet

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
don't want to lose the envelope just yet

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:23.630 
don't want to lose the envelope just yet
I<00:02:19.560> think<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.830> might<00:02:21.160> have<00:02:21.310> already<00:02:21.489> done<00:02:21.940> so

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
I think I might have already done so

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.289 
I think I might have already done so
it's<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.760> thing<00:02:25.030> once<00:02:25.269> you<00:02:25.390> break<00:02:25.569> the<00:02:25.750> glass

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
it's the thing once you break the glass

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.870 
it's the thing once you break the glass
it's<00:02:28.299> game<00:02:28.510> over

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
it's game over

00:02:29.880 --> 00:03:24.280 
it's game over
go<00:02:30.880> hot<00:02:35.400> get<00:02:36.400> that

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.830 

that<00:03:25.290> class<00:03:25.530> is<00:03:25.560> broken<00:03:26.099> right<00:03:26.750> down<00:03:27.750> the

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
that class is broken right down the

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:36.330 
that class is broken right down the
bottom<00:03:27.959> corner

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:43.750 

damn<00:03:37.340> glass<00:03:37.700> broke<00:03:40.540> going<00:03:41.540> cold<00:03:41.840> again<00:03:42.760> I'll

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:43.760 
damn glass broke going cold again I'll

00:03:43.760 --> 00:04:06.220 
damn glass broke going cold again I'll
take<00:03:44.000> off<00:03:44.150> one<00:03:44.329> of<00:03:44.359> the<00:03:44.480> x-sustain<00:03:45.469> wise

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.230 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.080 

yeah

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
yeah

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:15.140 
yeah
she's<00:04:08.660> dead

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:24.060 

it'll<00:04:16.150> crack<00:04:16.420> down<00:04:16.630> at<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.840> very<00:04:16.959> bottom<00:04:23.070> now

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
it'll crack down at the very bottom now

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:26.100 
it'll crack down at the very bottom now
let's<00:04:24.430> see<00:04:24.550> enter<00:04:24.700> that<00:04:24.850> one<00:04:25.030> thanks<00:04:25.960> for

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
let's see enter that one thanks for

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.380 
let's see enter that one thanks for
watching
