ok guys so something was telling me to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.670 
ok guys so something was telling me to
get<00:00:06.210> up<00:00:06.240> earlier<00:00:06.660> than<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.870> normally<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.440> and<00:00:07.620> I

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
get up earlier than I normally do and I

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.200 
get up earlier than I normally do and I
popped<00:00:07.919> in<00:00:08.130> college<00:00:08.460> ooty<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:08.790> there<00:00:08.880> was<00:00:09.059> an

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:09.210 
popped in college ooty and there was an

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:10.910 
popped in college ooty and there was an
update<00:00:09.450> i<00:00:09.690> was<00:00:09.960> hoping<00:00:10.230> it<00:00:10.349> was<00:00:10.469> something<00:00:10.500> for

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
update i was hoping it was something for

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.190 
update i was hoping it was something for
buried<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.490> like<00:00:12.330> the<00:00:12.450> leaderboards<00:00:12.990> and<00:00:13.080> it

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
buried and like the leaderboards and it

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.499 
buried and like the leaderboards and it
wasn't<00:00:13.650> but<00:00:14.250> someone<00:00:14.790> some<00:00:15.089> people<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.420> been

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
wasn't but someone some people have been

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.519 
wasn't but someone some people have been
saying<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.839> they've<00:00:15.960> been<00:00:15.990> able<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.289> get<00:00:16.410> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
saying that they've been able to get the

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.170 
saying that they've been able to get the
ray<00:00:16.680> gun<00:00:16.890> mark<00:00:17.100> 2<00:00:17.160> in<00:00:17.430> some<00:00:17.580> of<00:00:17.670> the<00:00:17.730> older<00:00:18.029> maps

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
ray gun mark 2 in some of the older maps

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.279 
ray gun mark 2 in some of the older maps
so<00:00:18.449> i<00:00:18.480> think<00:00:18.630> they<00:00:18.840> probably<00:00:18.990> did<00:00:19.260> something

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
so i think they probably did something

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.890 
so i think they probably did something
for<00:00:19.710> buried<00:00:19.980> as<00:00:20.100> well<00:00:20.340> but<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.359> what<00:00:21.630> they<00:00:21.779> are

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
for buried as well but on what they are

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.509 
for buried as well but on what they are
saying<00:00:22.080> that<00:00:22.289> it<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> that<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.279> patch

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
saying that it was is that it was patch

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.760 
as well that's all the global stuff now
weird<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.020> fixes<00:00:52.379> that<00:00:52.500> are<00:00:52.590> just

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
weird to the fixes that are just

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:54.380 
weird to the fixes that are just
specifically<00:00:53.280> just<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.640> mob<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.149> dead

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
specifically just for mob and the dead

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.540 
specifically just for mob and the dead
and<00:00:54.629> they<00:00:55.379> had<00:00:55.500> just<00:00:55.530> an<00:00:55.829> issue<00:00:55.980> reported<00:00:56.430> by

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
and they had just an issue reported by

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.010 
and they had just an issue reported by
the<00:00:56.610> community<00:00:56.850> where<00:00:57.239> players<00:00:57.449> could<00:00:57.719> avoid

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
the community where players could avoid

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.959 
the community where players could avoid
zombie<00:00:58.469> attacks<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:58.980> quarters<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.699> near

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
zombie attacks and quarters and near

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.240 
zombie attacks and quarters and near
perk<00:01:00.270> machines<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:01.500> I'm<00:01:01.680> guessing<00:01:01.859> there's<00:01:02.190> no

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
perk machines so I'm guessing there's no

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
perk machines so I'm guessing there's no
more<00:01:02.579> like<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:03.059> corner<00:01:03.359> glitches<00:01:03.719> or

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
more like little corner glitches or

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.990 
more like little corner glitches or
anything<00:01:04.140> like<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.159> also<00:01:05.309> fixed<00:01:05.820> where

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
anything like that they also fixed where

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.640 
anything like that they also fixed where
players<00:01:06.420> could<00:01:06.689> activate<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.290> electric

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
players could activate the electric

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.050 
players could activate the electric
chair<00:01:07.860> on<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.070> bridge<00:01:08.369> while<00:01:08.580> being<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.880> last

chair on the bridge while being in last

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.969 
chair on the bridge while being in last
stand<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.750> didn't<00:01:10.500> know<00:01:10.530> you<00:01:10.590> could<00:01:10.830> do<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.830 
stand I didn't know you could do that
they<00:01:11.700> also<00:01:11.850> fixed<00:01:12.270> where<00:01:12.360> you<00:01:12.540> could<00:01:12.659> reach

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840

that or you know dying by that so that's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.289 
that or you know dying by that so that's
good<00:01:49.380> that<00:01:49.409> they<00:01:49.649> fixed<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.009> they<00:01:50.970> fixed<00:01:51.240> an

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
good that they fixed that they fixed an

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.670 
good that they fixed that they fixed an
issue<00:01:51.390> where<00:01:51.750> screenshots<00:01:52.350> would<00:01:52.530> be

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
issue where screenshots would be

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.499 
issue where screenshots would be
distorted<00:01:53.159> or<00:01:53.250> corrupted<00:01:53.670> when<00:01:53.850> saved<00:01:54.180> and

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
distorted or corrupted when saved and

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.020 
distorted or corrupted when saved and
they<00:01:55.170> fix<00:01:55.500> several<00:01:55.829> map<00:01:56.159> holes<00:01:56.520> where<00:01:56.790> players

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
they fix several map holes where players

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940 
they fix several map holes where players
can<00:01:57.180> enter<00:01:57.659> unplayable<00:01:58.079> sections<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.770> map

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
can enter unplayable sections of the map

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
so that's good there's no more I guess

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.450 
so that's good there's no more I guess
glitching<00:02:00.899> or<00:02:01.020> anything<00:02:01.259> like<00:02:01.290> that<00:02:01.469> so<00:02:02.310> there
