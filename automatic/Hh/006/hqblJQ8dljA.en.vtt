dropped<00:01:47.980> it<00:01:48.190> drives<00:01:48.610> at<00:01:49.150> some<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.750> other

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:49.870 
dropped it drives at some of the other

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.420 
dropped it drives at some of the other
cars<00:01:50.080> and<00:01:50.320> you're<00:01:50.560> a<00:01:50.590> little<00:01:50.920> bit<00:01:51.070> more<00:01:51.280> in

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:51.430 
cars and you're a little bit more in

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.420 
cars and you're a little bit more in
tune<00:01:51.760> with<00:01:51.790> yeah<00:01:52.540> particular<00:01:53.140> car<00:01:53.380> I<00:01:53.680> think

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
tune with yeah particular car I think

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.640 
tune with yeah particular car I think
it's<00:01:54.580> it<00:01:54.820> feels<00:01:54.850> like<00:01:55.420> a<00:01:55.450> much<00:01:55.750> bigger<00:01:55.960> care<00:01:56.320> it

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
it's it feels like a much bigger care it

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's it feels like a much bigger care it
makes<00:01:56.860> oh<00:01:57.040> yeah<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.460> steering<00:01:57.880> is<00:01:57.940> quite

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
makes oh yeah the steering is quite

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.770 
makes oh yeah the steering is quite
heavy

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
heavy

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.609 
heavy
the<00:02:00.060> controls<00:02:01.060> are<00:02:01.240> quite<00:02:01.330> heavy<00:02:01.720> you've<00:02:02.440> got

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
the controls are quite heavy you've got

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.859 
the controls are quite heavy you've got
that<00:02:02.800> solid<00:02:03.369> feel<00:02:03.670> that<00:02:03.970> you<00:02:04.119> probably<00:02:04.479> would

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
that solid feel that you probably would

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:07.200 
that solid feel that you probably would
get<00:02:05.140> with<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.470> you<00:02:05.680> know<00:02:05.860> Kara<00:02:06.850> from<00:02:07.090> this

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
get with it you know Kara from this

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.060 
get with it you know Kara from this
manufacturer<00:02:07.660> so<00:02:08.080> this<00:02:08.380> is<00:02:08.530> perfect<00:02:09.039> for

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
manufacturer so this is perfect for

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.680 
manufacturer so this is perfect for
going<00:02:09.580> up<00:02:09.670> without<00:02:09.880> the<00:02:09.970> motor<00:02:10.119> but<00:02:10.420> I<00:02:10.509> don't

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 
going up without the motor but I don't

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.960 
going up without the motor but I don't
know<00:02:10.869> how<00:02:11.050> good<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.380> would<00:02:11.530> be<00:02:11.790> around<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
know how good it would be around the

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.850 
know how good it would be around the
windy<00:02:13.390> twisty<00:02:13.540> bends<00:02:13.959> it's<00:02:14.200> not<00:02:14.350> quite<00:02:14.650> as

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
windy twisty bends it's not quite as

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.979 
windy twisty bends it's not quite as
good<00:02:15.040> to<00:02:15.190> drive<00:02:15.220> on<00:02:15.670> the<00:02:15.940> on<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.630> country

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
good to drive on the on the country

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.750 
good to drive on the on the country
circuit<00:02:17.350> which<00:02:17.470> is<00:02:17.650> what<00:02:17.800> I<00:02:17.830> tend<00:02:18.310> to<00:02:18.400> do<00:02:18.550> more

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
circuit which is what I tend to do more

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:35.370 
circuit which is what I tend to do more
stuff<00:02:19.030> yeah

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.440
