what<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:51.899> thinking<00:00:52.079> at<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.500> point<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
what we're thinking at this point is

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
what we're thinking at this point is
that<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.969> fire<00:00:54.960> was<00:00:55.829> most<00:00:56.730> likely<00:00:56.969> not<00:00:57.480> caused

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that the fire was most likely not caused

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.650 
that the fire was most likely not caused
by<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:59.160> inmate<00:00:59.550> who<00:00:59.760> escaped<00:01:00.300> we're<00:01:00.539> not

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
by the inmate who escaped we're not

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:01.760 
by the inmate who escaped we're not
we're<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:00.899> seeing<00:01:01.170> a<00:01:01.260> connection<00:01:01.649> between

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
we're not seeing a connection between

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.889 
we're not seeing a connection between
them<00:01:02.129> obviously<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:02.760> very<00:01:02.940> suspicious<00:01:03.120> that

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
them obviously it's very suspicious that

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.380 
them obviously it's very suspicious that
the<00:01:04.049> two<00:01:04.170> occurred<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.650> same<00:01:04.830> time<00:01:05.390> we're

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
the two occurred at the same time we're

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
the two occurred at the same time we're
going<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.570> look<00:01:06.659> into<00:01:06.960> that<00:01:06.990> but<00:01:07.320> at<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
going to look into that but at this

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.530 
going to look into that but at this
point<00:01:08.159> we're<00:01:08.400> still<00:01:08.610> investigating<00:01:08.850> it<00:01:09.299> as<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
point we're still investigating it as a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.210 
point we're still investigating it as a
fire<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> what<00:01:10.590> we're<00:01:10.710> thinking<00:01:10.830> is<00:01:11.159> that

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
fire and what we're thinking is that

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
fire and what we're thinking is that
this<00:01:11.460> inmate<00:01:11.820> took<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.240> opportunity<00:01:12.860> while

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
this inmate took the opportunity while

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.469 
this inmate took the opportunity while
the<00:01:13.979> hustle-bustle<00:01:14.280> was<00:01:14.729> going<00:01:14.939> on<00:01:15.090> by<00:01:15.240> moving

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
the hustle-bustle was going on by moving

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.850 
the hustle-bustle was going on by moving
these<00:01:15.659> inmates<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.320> them<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.650> safe

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
these inmates to get them to a safe

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.609 
these inmates to get them to a safe
location<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.880> to<00:01:18.240> make<00:01:18.390> an<00:01:18.509> exit<00:01:18.840> that's<00:01:19.470> a

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
location to to make an exit that's a

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.109 
location to to make an exit that's a
brand-new<00:01:19.950> charge<00:01:20.310> and<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:20.640> escape<00:01:20.970> be
