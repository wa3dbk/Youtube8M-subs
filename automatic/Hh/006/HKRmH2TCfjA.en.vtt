about<00:04:26.750> things<00:04:26.930> that<00:04:27.020> were<00:04:27.139> going<00:04:27.290> on<00:04:27.500> so<00:04:27.770> we

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
about things that were going on so we

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.710 
about things that were going on so we
had<00:04:28.160> nothing<00:04:28.340> that<00:04:28.760> was<00:04:29.120> that<00:04:29.330> much<00:04:29.479> of<00:04:29.660> a

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
had nothing that was that much of a

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:30.070
