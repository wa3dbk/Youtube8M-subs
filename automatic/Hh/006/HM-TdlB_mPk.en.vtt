00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.480
 Hello people, welcome to one more 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.340
 video from windows 8.1 pro site ms o 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.349
 geek.com br br 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:24.110
 the ntv channel on youtube also for the whole 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.939
 the microsoft technet community 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.869
 In this video here I'll show you 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:33.290
 like we disabled the installation 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.930
 of drivers using windows update 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.620
 so when you install a 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:42.920
 driver you have the option to make 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.960
 windows search the latest drive 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.760
 through windows update 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.860
 So, how do you disable this? 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.220
 option also for suddenly you 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.699
 install the driver you downloaded directly 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.220
 The manufacturer is fine, so I'll show you 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.659
 For you, this is where this option is. 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.650
 reminding me that I made a video too 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.670
 showing how we disabled the 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:07.939
 windows install a driver option 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.770
 automatically 

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:12.469
 then we can not confuse the 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.439
 videos that are different in that 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.020
 video shows how to disable that 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:19.810
 windows install driver option 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.869
 automatically so that you can 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.789
 insert or driver is different from that 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.369
 what windows is proposing to you 

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:29.679
 and this video here is about that 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:31.909
 option to install the driver 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.640
 automatically using windows update 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:37.159
 are are different things 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.749
 I here on the desktop the button 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.450
 right on my computer properties 

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:47.119
 here on properties on the left 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.609
 here are the advanced settings of the 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.009
 system 

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:56.149
 I'm going to click the hardware tab 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:59.240
 I have the settings button here 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:00.170
 device installation who clicks 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.780
 in him 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.499
 note that by default it has been set 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.929
 here yes do automatically want 

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:12.080

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.640
 realistic icons for your devices 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.910
 so what are you going to do, will you come? 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.210
 Here, do not let me choose what to do. 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.710
 even then you have the option that always 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.270
 installed 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.180
 ndrive software using windows 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:29.060
 update and selecting this option 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.310
 disable this update this 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.860
 installation using windows update does not 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:37.180
 install the drive software using the 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:40.730
 windows update ok here 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.010
 save changes ready from 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.260
 now that installation option 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.900
 windows update driver is not 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.590
 enabled and you can use the 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:54.410
 driver you got from your manufacturer 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.990
 whether it is more current or an earlier version 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.900
