00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:50.749 
to spawn it and it got really

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:52.450

they work but every time I thought every

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
the new spawns are and one thing i want

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.069 
the new spawns are and one thing i want
to<00:02:46.310> add<00:02:46.430> about<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.879> spawns<00:02:47.209> their<00:02:47.629> self<00:02:47.870> is

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:48.079 
to add about the spawns their self is

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.929 
to add about the spawns their self is
they<00:02:48.739> kind<00:02:48.950> of<00:02:49.010> going<00:02:49.189> to<00:02:49.280> lend<00:02:49.430> yourself<00:02:49.519> more

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
they kind of going to lend yourself more

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:52.360 
they kind of going to lend yourself more
to<00:02:50.060> marksman<00:02:50.540> than<00:02:50.659> ever<00:02:50.870> before<00:02:51.319> i'm<00:02:51.980> using

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
to marksman than ever before i'm using

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.740 
to marksman than ever before i'm using
dead<00:02:52.519> silence<00:02:52.970> here<00:02:53.180> and<00:02:53.359> I've<00:02:53.629> actually

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
dead silence here and I've actually

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.330 
dead silence here and I've actually
started<00:02:54.049> using<00:02:54.319> that<00:02:54.440> sounds<00:02:54.829> more<00:02:55.069> and<00:02:55.099> more

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
started using that sounds more and more

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.339 
started using that sounds more and more
and<00:02:55.459> more<00:02:55.489> because<00:02:55.909> I<00:02:55.940> realized<00:02:56.810> that<00:02:57.019> you<00:02:57.200> can

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
and more because I realized that you can

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:00.520 
and more because I realized that you can
sound<00:02:57.590> war<00:02:57.829> on<00:02:57.920> TDM<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.959> but<00:02:59.959> marksman<00:03:00.440> is

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
sound war on TDM and but marksman is

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:01.390 
sound war on TDM and but marksman is
going<00:03:00.680> to<00:03:00.739> be<00:03:00.829> something<00:03:01.040> that's<00:03:01.159> more

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
going to be something that's more

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.220 
going to be something that's more
prevalent<00:03:01.879> which<00:03:02.060> would<00:03:02.269> make<00:03:02.420> assassin<00:03:03.079> more

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
prevalent which would make assassin more

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.629 
prevalent which would make assassin more
prevalent<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:03.799> I<00:03:03.829> can<00:03:04.069> see<00:03:04.220> it<00:03:04.340> kind<00:03:04.489> of

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:04.639 
prevalent so I can see it kind of

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:06.039 
prevalent so I can see it kind of
slowing<00:03:05.000> the<00:03:05.120> game<00:03:05.239> down<00:03:05.299> a<00:03:05.540> little<00:03:05.840> bit

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:06.049 
slowing the game down a little bit

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:08.050 
slowing the game down a little bit
because<00:03:06.470> I<00:03:06.650> had<00:03:06.829> a<00:03:06.859> couple<00:03:07.159> really<00:03:07.670> really

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
because I had a couple really really

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.369 
because I had a couple really really
slow<00:03:08.239> gains<00:03:08.480> actually<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.900> first<00:03:09.019> couple

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:09.379 
slow gains actually the first couple

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.830 
slow gains actually the first couple
games<00:03:09.409> we<00:03:09.680> played<00:03:09.920> really<00:03:10.700> super<00:03:11.329> slow<00:03:11.569> and

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:11.840 
games we played really super slow and

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.720 
games we played really super slow and
the<00:03:12.500> whole<00:03:12.650> reason<00:03:12.859> that<00:03:13.010> is<00:03:13.340> the<00:03:13.489> people

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730 
the whole reason that is the people

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.420 
the whole reason that is the people
sitting<00:03:13.939> in<00:03:14.120> corners<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:14.750> assassin<00:03:15.290> and<00:03:15.439> you

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
sitting in corners with assassin and you

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.949 
sitting in corners with assassin and you
know<00:03:16.549> marks<00:03:17.209> was<00:03:17.329> gonna<00:03:17.480> be<00:03:17.540> such<00:03:17.720> a<00:03:17.750> bigger

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
know marks was gonna be such a bigger

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:18.910 
know marks was gonna be such a bigger
deal<00:03:18.109> because<00:03:18.290> they're<00:03:18.470> going<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.650> be<00:03:18.709> a<00:03:18.739> whole

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:18.920 
deal because they're going to be a whole

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:20.589 
deal because they're going to be a whole
lot<00:03:18.950> more<00:03:19.220> standoff<00:03:19.760> since<00:03:20.150> people<00:03:20.420> know

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
lot more standoff since people know

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:22.179 
lot more standoff since people know
which<00:03:20.840> way<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.079> point<00:03:21.439> out<00:03:21.590> which<00:03:21.799> way<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:21.980> aim

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
which way to point out which way the aim

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:24.099 
which way to point out which way the aim
is<00:03:22.220> going<00:03:22.549> to<00:03:22.639> put<00:03:22.970> more<00:03:23.150> direct<00:03:23.569> gun<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:23.900> guns

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:24.109 
is going to put more direct gun on guns

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.939 
is going to put more direct gun on guns
you<00:03:24.560> know<00:03:24.790> standoffs<00:03:25.790> and<00:03:26.030> you<00:03:26.810> know<00:03:26.959> like

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
you know standoffs and you know like

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.559 
you know standoffs and you know like
beforehand<00:03:28.639> the<00:03:28.760> spawns<00:03:29.030> of<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.209> ravine

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
beforehand the spawns of the ravine

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:31.449 
beforehand the spawns of the ravine
system<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.049> kill<00:03:30.319> somebody<00:03:30.560> then<00:03:31.190> you<00:03:31.280> go<00:03:31.400> to

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
system you kill somebody then you go to

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.309 
system you kill somebody then you go to
fight<00:03:31.730> his<00:03:31.879> buddy<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.209> that<00:03:32.419> guy<00:03:32.569> but<00:03:32.810> spawn<00:03:33.079> so

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
fight his buddy in that guy but spawn so

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:34.629 
fight his buddy in that guy but spawn so
close<00:03:33.560> to<00:03:33.739> you<00:03:33.829> that<00:03:33.980> you<00:03:34.099> know<00:03:34.250> fighting<00:03:34.430> your

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:34.639 
close to you that you know fighting your

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:36.339 
close to you that you know fighting your
him<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.150> his<00:03:35.329> buddy<00:03:35.540> at<00:03:35.690> the<00:03:35.780> same<00:03:35.959> time<00:03:36.169> you

00:03:36.339 --> 00:03:36.349 
him and his buddy at the same time you

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:37.899 
him and his buddy at the same time you
end<00:03:36.470> up<00:03:36.530> getting<00:03:36.650> killed<00:03:36.949> on<00:03:37.129> to<00:03:37.340> kill<00:03:37.609> streak

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
end up getting killed on to kill streak

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.879 
end up getting killed on to kill streak
like<00:03:38.659> I<00:03:38.780> said<00:03:38.989> before<00:03:39.139> one<00:03:39.470> of<00:03:39.500> my<00:03:39.590> earlier

00:03:39.879 --> 00:03:39.889 
like I said before one of my earlier

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:41.199 
like I said before one of my earlier
videos<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.340> seems<00:03:40.519> like<00:03:40.609> modern<00:03:40.849> warfare<00:03:41.000> 3

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
videos it seems like modern warfare 3

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:43.569 
videos it seems like modern warfare 3
thinks<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:41.900> ungodly<00:03:42.440> sin<00:03:43.099> for<00:03:43.280> somebody<00:03:43.549> to

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:43.579 
thinks it's ungodly sin for somebody to

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:45.759 
thinks it's ungodly sin for somebody to
get<00:03:43.730> a<00:03:43.790> UAV<00:03:44.150> and<00:03:44.540> that<00:03:45.139> that<00:03:45.319> was<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.620> case

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
get a UAV and that that was the case

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:47.199 
get a UAV and that that was the case
because<00:03:46.159> of<00:03:46.280> the<00:03:46.340> way<00:03:46.430> the<00:03:46.519> maps<00:03:46.730> are<00:03:46.879> designed

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
because of the way the maps are designed

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.759 
because of the way the maps are designed
and<00:03:47.419> the<00:03:47.510> revenge<00:03:47.840> spawn<00:03:48.079> system<00:03:48.319> since<00:03:48.680> they

00:03:48.759 --> 00:03:48.769 
and the revenge spawn system since they

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:50.229 
and the revenge spawn system since they
took<00:03:48.889> the<00:03:49.040> revenge<00:03:49.370> spawn<00:03:49.579> system<00:03:49.729> out<00:03:50.030> of<00:03:50.150> the

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
took the revenge spawn system out of the

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.809 
took the revenge spawn system out of the
game<00:03:50.829> not<00:03:51.829> the<00:03:51.979> case<00:03:52.099> no<00:03:52.310> more<00:03:52.459> you<00:03:52.549> get<00:03:52.639> a<00:03:52.669> lot

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
game not the case no more you get a lot

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.159 
game not the case no more you get a lot
more<00:03:52.849> one-on-one<00:03:53.419> engagements<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:53.989> you<00:03:54.109> get

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
more one-on-one engagements but you get

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
right side of it there's like a cash

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:13.390 
right side of it there's like a cash
register<00:04:11.690> and<00:04:12.079> like<00:04:12.560> a<00:04:12.590> little<00:04:12.799> thing<00:04:13.099> that

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
bumps out in the middle where the B flag

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:17.259 
bumps out in the middle where the B flag
you<00:04:15.169> normally<00:04:15.470> would<00:04:15.650> be<00:04:15.829> if<00:04:16.489> you<00:04:16.609> stand<00:04:16.880> in

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
you normally would be if you stand in

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.120 
you normally would be if you stand in
the<00:04:17.630> cash<00:04:17.870> register<00:04:18.109> area<00:04:18.620> you<00:04:18.799> cover<00:04:19.010> the

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
the cash register area you cover the

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.069 
the cash register area you cover the
right<00:04:19.370> middle<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.120> left<00:04:20.389> of<00:04:20.539> the<00:04:20.630> map<00:04:20.840> and

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
right middle and left of the map and

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.300 
right middle and left of the map and
they're<00:04:21.229> always<00:04:21.380> going<00:04:21.590> to<00:04:21.680> spawn<00:04:21.919> somewhere

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
they're always going to spawn somewhere

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.279 
they're always going to spawn somewhere
in<00:04:22.400> that<00:04:22.490> vicinity<00:04:22.580> and<00:04:23.270> flow<00:04:23.900> through<00:04:24.199> the

00:04:24.279 --> 00:04:24.289 
in that vicinity and flow through the

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.110 
in that vicinity and flow through the
middle<00:04:24.590> so<00:04:25.039> you<00:04:25.099> don't<00:04:25.460> have<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.760> move<00:04:25.909> in<00:04:26.090> that

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
middle so you don't have to move in that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.180 
middle so you don't have to move in that
in<00:04:26.360> that<00:04:26.389> kind<00:04:26.750> of<00:04:26.810> instance<00:04:27.650> and<00:04:27.860> you<00:04:28.039> can

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
in that kind of instance and you can

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.490 
in that kind of instance and you can
still<00:04:28.250> get<00:04:28.520> a<00:04:28.580> really<00:04:28.849> good<00:04:28.880> game<00:04:29.240> it<00:04:29.960> kind<00:04:30.440> of

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
still get a really good game it kind of

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.200 
still get a really good game it kind of
