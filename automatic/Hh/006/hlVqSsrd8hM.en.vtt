looks<00:01:37.200> like<00:01:37.290> in<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> middle<00:01:37.770> of<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.890> field

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
looks like in the middle of the field

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.069 
looks like in the middle of the field
against<00:01:38.820> cover<00:01:39.000> for<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> actually<00:01:39.540> works<00:01:40.020> a

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
against cover for it actually works a

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.480 
against cover for it actually works a
little<00:01:40.170> bit<00:01:40.320> better<00:01:40.500> off<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:40.950> wide<00:01:41.189> side

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
little bit better off to the wide side

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.069 
little bit better off to the wide side
of<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> field<00:01:41.759> rather<00:01:42.240> than<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> short<00:01:42.869> side

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
of the field rather than the short side

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:45.230 
of the field rather than the short side
so<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:43.680> want<00:01:43.799> to<00:01:43.890> do<00:01:44.009> in<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> middle<00:01:44.310> or<00:01:44.640> you

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
so you want to do in the middle or you

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.179 
so you want to do in the middle or you
want<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.420> put<00:01:45.600> that<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.770> wide<00:01:46.920> side<00:01:47.130> of

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
want to put that in the the wide side of

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.380 
want to put that in the the wide side of
the<00:01:47.310> field<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.700> it's<00:01:47.820> run<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.030> one<00:01:48.180> more<00:01:48.299> time

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
the field so it's run this one more time

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.120 
the field so it's run this one more time
against<00:01:48.659> cover<00:01:48.869> for

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.270 

all<00:01:54.130> right<00:01:54.310> here<00:01:54.520> we<00:01:54.550> go<00:01:54.760> and<00:01:55.650> here's<00:01:56.650> her<00:01:56.800> play

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:02.770 
and you don't have to do the spectacular

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.680 
and you don't have to do the spectacular
catch<00:02:02.979> I<00:02:03.130> just<00:02:03.310> do<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.729> out<00:02:03.850> of<00:02:03.880> habit<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.600> the

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
catch I just do it out of habit with the

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.630 
catch I just do it out of habit with the
why<00:02:04.840> that's<00:02:05.380> basically<00:02:05.530> how<00:02:05.800> that<00:02:05.979> works<00:02:06.160> now

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
why that's basically how that works now

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
why that's basically how that works now
let's<00:02:06.790> go<00:02:06.880> ahead<00:02:07.090> and<00:02:07.210> put<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.390> back<00:02:07.479> in<00:02:07.630> the

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 
let's go ahead and put it back in the

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.440 
let's go ahead and put it back in the
middle<00:02:07.870> of<00:02:07.900> the<00:02:07.960> field<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.619> let's<00:02:08.800> go<00:02:09.450> against

middle of the field and let's go against

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.720 
middle of the field and let's go against
cover<00:02:10.660> three<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.340> there's<00:02:12.340> money<00:02:12.520> to<00:02:12.550> cover

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
cover three and there's money to cover

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.100 
cover three and there's money to cover
for<00:02:12.880> because<00:02:13.090> it's<00:02:13.180> easier<00:02:13.450> with<00:02:13.510> controllers

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110

field and what's a nice let's see about

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.340 
field and what's a nice let's see about
this<00:02:45.910> I'll<00:02:46.360> go<00:02:46.450> ahead<00:02:46.660> I'll<00:02:46.780> show<00:02:46.959> this<00:02:47.110> one

this I'll go ahead I'll show this one

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:48.420 
this I'll go ahead I'll show this one
more<00:02:47.470> time<00:02:47.560> and<00:02:47.680> I'll<00:02:47.770> make<00:02:47.890> my<00:02:48.010> point<00:02:48.190> here<00:02:48.340> in

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
a second so this is just the wide side

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.740 
a second so this is just the wide side
of<00:02:49.930> the<00:02:49.989> field<00:02:50.580> all<00:02:51.580> right<00:02:51.790> now<00:02:54.450> same<00:02:55.450> route

of the field all right now same route
combination<00:02:56.260> here<00:02:56.470> let's<00:02:56.799> put<00:02:56.980> the<00:02:57.100> X<00:02:57.280> on<00:02:57.459> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
combination here let's put the X on a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.020 
combination here let's put the X on a
smart<00:02:58.570> route<00:02:58.750> and<00:02:59.519> you're<00:03:00.519> going<00:03:00.610> to<00:03:00.670> see<00:03:00.850> that

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
smart route and you're going to see that

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.090 
smart route and you're going to see that
it<00:03:01.150> does<00:03:01.330> kill<00:03:01.690> cover<00:03:02.019> three<00:03:02.260> as<00:03:02.380> well<00:03:02.590> you're

when they base online or setting up a

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.949 
when they base online or setting up a
blitz<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:35.860> just<00:03:36.070> one<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.250> those<00:03:36.340> things<00:03:36.430> that

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
blitz it's just one of those things that

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.210 
blitz it's just one of those things that
they<00:03:37.959> learn<00:03:38.140> alot<00:03:38.380> ablates<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.829> through

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220 
they learn alot ablates is through

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:40.770 
they learn alot ablates is through
youtube<00:03:39.610> and<00:03:39.850> what<00:03:39.970> not<00:03:40.150> a<00:03:40.180> lot<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.420> the<00:03:40.540> first

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
youtube and what not a lot of the first

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:42.270 
youtube and what not a lot of the first
thing<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.110> the<00:03:41.260> baseline<00:03:41.739> so<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.010> always<00:03:42.160> have

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
thing is the baseline so you always have

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.069 
thing is the baseline so you always have
your<00:03:42.430> players<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.030> same<00:03:43.239> position<00:03:43.660> to

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:44.079 
your players in the same position to

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.680 
your players in the same position to
make<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.260> blitz<00:03:44.590> work<00:03:44.799> so<00:03:45.549> just<00:03:45.790> know<00:03:45.970> that<00:03:46.000> if

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
make the blitz work so just know that if

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.840 
make the blitz work so just know that if
somebody<00:03:46.989> doesn't<00:03:47.410> follow<00:03:47.980> that<00:03:48.280> guy<00:03:48.459> most

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
somebody doesn't follow that guy most

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.370 
somebody doesn't follow that guy most
likely<00:03:48.970> it's<00:03:49.390> going<00:03:49.630> to<00:03:49.720> be<00:03:49.810> a<00:03:49.840> blitz<00:03:50.140> so<00:03:50.290> you

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380 
likely it's going to be a blitz so you

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.130 
likely it's going to be a blitz so you
want<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.590> make<00:03:50.620> sure<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:52.140> know

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
want to make sure that you know

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.140 
want to make sure that you know
accordingly<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.920> kind<00:03:54.340> of<00:03:54.370> give<00:03:54.519> yourself<00:03:54.970> a

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
accordingly and kind of give yourself a

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:56.940 
accordingly and kind of give yourself a
little<00:03:55.180> bit<00:03:55.540> better<00:03:55.720> opportunity<00:03:56.560> to<00:03:56.769> have<00:03:56.920> a

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
little bit better opportunity to have a

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.920 
little bit better opportunity to have a
hot<00:03:57.280> route<00:03:57.549> if<00:03:57.790> it<00:03:58.390> comes<00:03:58.480> to<00:03:58.630> the<00:03:58.720> blitz

00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:58.930 
hot route if it comes to the blitz

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.360 
hot route if it comes to the blitz
because<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.230> is<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.380> play<00:03:59.829> that<00:03:59.860> has<00:04:00.099> a<00:04:00.129> little

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370 
because this is a play that has a little

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.600 
because this is a play that has a little
bit<00:04:00.959> longer<00:04:02.010> development<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.160> play<00:04:03.370> and

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
bit longer development of a play and

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.020 
bit longer development of a play and
that<00:04:03.879> type<00:04:04.090> play<00:04:04.239> I'd<00:04:04.360> put<00:04:04.510> the<00:04:04.599> beat

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
that type play I'd put the beat

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.480 
that type play I'd put the beat
a<00:04:05.060> slant<00:04:06.020> whatever<00:04:06.620> the<00:04:06.740> case<00:04:06.890> is<00:04:07.069> but<00:04:07.250> this<00:04:07.340> is

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
a slant whatever the case is but this is

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.190 
a slant whatever the case is but this is
the<00:04:07.610> route<00:04:08.209> combination<00:04:08.750> right<00:04:08.840> now<00:04:08.990> so<00:04:09.140> I

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
the route combination right now so I

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.320 
the route combination right now so I
leave<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.500> that<00:04:09.560> way<00:04:09.709> okay<00:04:09.830> so<00:04:10.490> even<00:04:10.880> with<00:04:11.090> base

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
leave it that way okay so even with base

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:13.510 
leave it that way okay so even with base
the<00:04:11.480> line<00:04:11.660> you're<00:04:12.350> going<00:04:12.470> to<00:04:12.560> see<00:04:12.740> that<00:04:13.400> it

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
the line you're going to see that it

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.060 
the line you're going to see that it
still<00:04:13.760> works<00:04:14.030> are<00:04:15.020> just<00:04:15.230> a<00:04:15.350> reportable<00:04:15.800> past

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
still works are just a reportable past

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.150 
still works are just a reportable past
their<00:04:16.720> baseline<00:04:17.720> doesn't<00:04:18.139> affect<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:18.980> way

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
their baseline doesn't affect the way

exact setup and it's going to work just
the<00:05:02.810> same<00:05:02.840> as<00:05:03.320> it<00:05:03.350> did<00:05:03.590> in<00:05:05.620> cover<00:05:06.639> two<00:05:07.639> and

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
the same as it did in cover two and

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:14.310 
the same as it did in cover two and
three<00:05:08.150> and<00:05:08.330> you're<00:05:09.110> going<00:05:09.200> to<00:05:09.260> see<00:05:09.470> basically

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.380 

the<00:05:14.890> way<00:05:15.010> it<00:05:15.130> heads<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.430> they're<00:05:15.640> not<00:05:15.820> sure

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 
the way it heads up they're not sure

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:17.970 
the way it heads up they're not sure
what<00:05:16.510> like<00:05:16.600> I<00:05:16.720> traveled<00:05:17.350> with<00:05:17.380> him<00:05:17.530> let<00:05:17.650> me<00:05:17.710> see

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:17.980 
what like I traveled with him let me see

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.920 
what like I traveled with him let me see
what<00:05:18.130> i<00:05:18.160> did<00:05:18.220> there<00:05:18.400> wrong<00:05:18.730> there<00:05:18.940> normally

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:19.930 
what i did there wrong there normally

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.330 
what i did there wrong there normally
this<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.080> wide<00:05:20.470> open<00:05:20.500> with<00:05:20.830> cover<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.310> its

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
this is wide open with cover to its

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.890 
this is wide open with cover to its
actually<00:05:21.730> usually<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.150> best<00:05:22.360> way<00:05:22.510> to<00:05:22.660> beat

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
actually usually the best way to beat

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.310 
actually usually the best way to beat
cover<00:05:23.110> two<00:05:23.350> um<00:05:24.750> let's<00:05:25.750> see<00:05:25.870> what<00:05:26.020> happened

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:26.320 
cover two um let's see what happened

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:30.290 
cover two um let's see what happened
with<00:05:26.470> that<00:05:26.500> play<00:05:27.190> there<00:05:27.840> go<00:05:28.840> ahead<00:05:29.080> here<00:05:29.440> oh

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
with that play there go ahead here oh

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.390 
with that play there go ahead here oh
yeah<00:05:31.300> so<00:05:31.660> that's<00:05:32.380> how<00:05:33.040> it's<00:05:33.160> going<00:05:33.250> to<00:05:33.340> work

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
yeah so that's how it's going to work

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.190 
yeah so that's how it's going to work
against<00:05:33.670> cover<00:05:33.880> too<00:05:34.120> just<00:05:34.510> as<00:05:34.660> well<00:05:34.870> as<00:05:35.050> it

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:35.200 
against cover too just as well as it

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.100 
against cover too just as well as it
does<00:05:35.350> against<00:05:35.620> cover<00:05:35.830> three<00:05:36.130> and<00:05:36.220> cover<00:05:36.370> for

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.110 
does against cover three and cover for

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.660 
does against cover three and cover for
so<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.800> last<00:05:38.950> thing<00:05:39.070> when<00:05:39.280> I<00:05:39.340> show<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.580> is

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 
so the last thing when I show you is

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.430 
so the last thing when I show you is
against<00:05:39.940> man<00:05:40.150> coverage<00:05:40.390> they<00:05:40.960> can<00:05:41.140> see<00:05:41.320> how

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:41.440 
against man coverage they can see how

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.180 
against man coverage they can see how
this<00:05:41.590> beats<00:05:41.980> all<00:05:43.230> coverages<00:05:44.230> I<00:05:44.500> like<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:44.890> use

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:45.190 
this beats all coverages I like to use

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:50.610 
this beats all coverages I like to use
