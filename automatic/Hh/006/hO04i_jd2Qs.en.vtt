I<00:01:58.860> also<00:01:59.369> don't<00:01:59.790> think<00:01:59.939> that<00:02:00.270> there<00:02:00.570> should<00:02:00.810> be

with it

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.859 
with it
I<00:02:05.219> think<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:05.700> an<00:02:05.820> antiquated<00:02:06.119> system<00:02:06.420> that's

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
I think it's an antiquated system that's

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.410 
I think it's an antiquated system that's
based<00:02:07.079> on<00:02:07.380> alpha<00:02:08.220> male<00:02:08.429> chimpanzee<00:02:09.239> behavior

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

based on alpha male chimpanzee behavior
I<00:02:09.869> really<00:02:10.170> do<00:02:10.319> I<00:02:10.530> think<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.920> idea<00:02:11.220> of<00:02:11.310> one<00:02:11.610> guy

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
I really do I think the idea of one guy

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.809 
I really do I think the idea of one guy
like<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> president<00:02:13.319> or<00:02:13.379> what

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
like a president or what

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.630 
like a president or what
one<00:02:14.239> alpha<00:02:14.510> that<00:02:15.200> rules<00:02:15.829> the<00:02:16.189> whole<00:02:16.340> it's

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
one alpha that rules the whole it's

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.819 
one alpha that rules the whole it's
ridiculous<00:02:17.329> we<00:02:17.540> have<00:02:17.750> the<00:02:17.959> internet<00:02:18.349> now<00:02:18.530> and

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:18.829 
ridiculous we have the internet now and

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:20.380 
ridiculous we have the internet now and
I<00:02:19.069> honestly<00:02:19.400> think<00:02:19.670> that<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.939> internet<00:02:20.239> is

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
I honestly think that the internet is

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.630 
I honestly think that the internet is
the<00:02:20.420> best<00:02:20.569> way<00:02:21.049> to<00:02:21.109> govern<00:02:21.680> things<00:02:21.859> I<00:02:22.159> think<00:02:22.489> it

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
the best way to govern things I think it

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.699 
the best way to govern things I think it
just<00:02:22.790> has<00:02:22.939> to<00:02:23.090> be<00:02:23.120> figured<00:02:23.480> out<00:02:23.629> how<00:02:24.140> people

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
just has to be figured out how people

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.830 
just has to be figured out how people
can<00:02:25.010> have<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> say<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:25.969> representative

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
can have a say like representative

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.959 
can have a say like representative
government<00:02:27.379> is<00:02:27.469> not<00:02:27.620> necessary<00:02:28.280> anymore<00:02:28.549> the

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:28.969 
government is not necessary anymore the

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.780 
government is not necessary anymore the
idea<00:02:29.599> of<00:02:29.780> it<00:02:29.959> being<00:02:30.530> like<00:02:30.920> you<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:31.220> a<00:02:31.250> senator

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
idea of it being like you need a senator

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.009 
idea of it being like you need a senator
you<00:02:31.819> need<00:02:32.060> a<00:02:32.120> congressman<00:02:32.810> your

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
you need a congressman your

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.780 
you need a congressman your
representative<00:02:33.680> of<00:02:33.799> your<00:02:33.920> state<00:02:34.189> I<00:02:34.400> don't

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
representative of your state I don't

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.640 
representative of your state I don't
think<00:02:35.209> that's<00:02:35.390> necessary<00:02:35.959> anymore<00:02:36.260> I<00:02:36.439> don't

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
think that's necessary anymore I don't

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.800 
think that's necessary anymore I don't
like<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.250> idea<00:02:37.609> of<00:02:37.670> it<00:02:37.819> I<00:02:37.879> think<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.359> idea<00:02:38.720> of

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
like the idea of it I think the idea of

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.390 
like the idea of it I think the idea of
it<00:02:38.989> was<00:02:39.019> based<00:02:39.379> on<00:02:39.560> when<00:02:39.769> there<00:02:39.920> was<00:02:40.010> was

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
it was based on when there was was

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.129 
it was based on when there was was
impossible<00:02:41.120> to<00:02:41.150> communicate<00:02:41.389> with<00:02:41.780> people

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:42.139 
impossible to communicate with people

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:43.420 
impossible to communicate with people
there<00:02:42.319> were<00:02:42.409> thousands<00:02:42.889> of<00:02:42.980> miles<00:02:43.159> away

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
there were thousands of miles away

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.640 
there were thousands of miles away
that's<00:02:43.939> not<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.269> case<00:02:44.450> anymore<00:02:44.719> now<00:02:45.109> you<00:02:45.530> can

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
that's not the case anymore now you can

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.410 
that's not the case anymore now you can
have<00:02:45.739> instantaneous<00:02:46.639> communication<00:02:47.329> with

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
people all over the world and I just

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.030 
people all over the world and I just
think<00:02:49.609> this<00:02:49.700> idea<00:02:49.909> of<00:02:50.950> presidents<00:02:51.950> and

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
think this idea of presidents and

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.830 
think this idea of presidents and
congressmen<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.879> that<00:02:53.329> that<00:02:53.480> that<00:02:53.510> that's

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
congressmen and that that that that's

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.569 
congressmen and that that that that's
how<00:02:54.079> we<00:02:54.139> should<00:02:54.349> dictate<00:02:54.680> laws<00:02:55.189> and<00:02:55.489> that's

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:55.579 
how we should dictate laws and that's

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:57.069 
how we should dictate laws and that's
how<00:02:55.760> we<00:02:55.819> should<00:02:55.970> figure<00:02:56.450> out<00:02:56.629> how<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.810> govern

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
how we should figure out how to govern

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.869 
how we should figure out how to govern
an<00:02:57.290> ethical<00:02:57.799> society<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.370> think<00:02:58.519> it's

00:02:58.869 --> 00:02:58.879 
an ethical society I think it's

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:00.909 
an ethical society I think it's
antiquated<00:02:59.359> interesting<00:03:00.260> so<00:03:00.470> how<00:03:00.650> would<00:03:00.709> you

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:00.919 
antiquated interesting so how would you

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.220 
antiquated interesting so how would you
govern<00:03:01.489> a<00:03:01.879> country<00:03:02.090> like<00:03:02.720> the<00:03:02.870> United<00:03:02.900> States

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
govern a country like the United States

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.720 
govern a country like the United States
if<00:03:03.560> you<00:03:03.650> don't<00:03:03.829> have<00:03:04.010> the<00:03:04.159> system<00:03:04.489> that<00:03:04.609> we

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
if you don't have the system that we

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.729 
if you don't have the system that we
have<00:03:04.760> set<00:03:05.090> up<00:03:05.239> and<00:03:05.419> by<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.569> way<00:03:05.750> I<00:03:05.780> mean<00:03:06.139> to<00:03:06.590> say

00:03:06.729 --> 00:03:06.739 
have set up and by the way I mean to say

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.140 
have set up and by the way I mean to say
that<00:03:06.919> there's<00:03:07.099> one<00:03:07.159> person<00:03:07.549> who<00:03:07.760> calls<00:03:07.970> the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
that there's one person who calls the

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.819 
that there's one person who calls the
shots<00:03:08.180> is<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.750> little<00:03:08.989> unfair<00:03:09.319> because<00:03:09.590> we<00:03:09.709> do

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
shots is a little unfair because we do

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.530 
shots is a little unfair because we do
have<00:03:09.919> a<00:03:09.980> system<00:03:10.340> of<00:03:10.459> checks<00:03:10.730> and<00:03:10.819> balances<00:03:11.329> of

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
it based on this system that we already

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.860 
it based on this system that we already
have<00:03:37.099> in<00:03:37.190> place<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.519> try<00:03:37.609> to<00:03:37.639> fix<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.209> I<00:03:38.359> think

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
have in place to try to fix it I think

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.420 
have in place to try to fix it I think
the<00:03:39.079> system<00:03:39.409> that<00:03:39.500> we<00:03:39.590> have<00:03:39.620> in<00:03:39.829> place<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.190> just

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
the system that we have in place is just

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.509 
the system that we have in place is just
it's<00:03:41.180> so<00:03:41.449> crazy<00:03:41.750> it's<00:03:42.079> so<00:03:42.199> ridiculous<00:03:42.799> that

00:03:43.509 --> 00:03:43.519 
it's so crazy it's so ridiculous that

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:45.520 
it's so crazy it's so ridiculous that
you<00:03:44.060> would<00:03:44.180> have<00:03:44.329> to<00:03:44.510> start<00:03:44.569> from<00:03:44.780> scratch<00:03:45.079> and

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
you would have to start from scratch and

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:47.860 
you would have to start from scratch and
you<00:03:46.010> would<00:03:46.129> have<00:03:46.250> to<00:03:46.459> fit<00:03:46.669> it<00:03:46.790> figure<00:03:47.209> out<00:03:47.239> some

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
you would have to fit it figure out some

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.270 
you would have to fit it figure out some
sort<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.799> an<00:03:49.129> ethical<00:03:49.729> honest<00:03:50.510> way<00:03:51.409> to<00:03:51.440> handle

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
sort of an ethical honest way to handle

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.430 
sort of an ethical honest way to handle
everything<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:52.940> I<00:03:53.000> just<00:03:53.299> I<00:03:53.599> don't<00:03:54.019> know<00:03:54.169> I'm

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
everything and I just I don't know I'm

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.369 
everything and I just I don't know I'm
not<00:03:54.620> qualified<00:03:54.889> not<00:03:55.879> quite<00:03:56.150> qualified<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.079> to

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
not qualified not quite qualified to to

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:59.619 
not qualified not quite qualified to to
manage<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:57.949> not<00:03:58.280> qualified<00:03:58.819> to<00:03:59.090> engineer

00:03:59.619 --> 00:03:59.629 
manage that not qualified to engineer

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:01.719 
manage that not qualified to engineer
that<00:03:59.659> but<00:04:00.470> I<00:04:00.500> think<00:04:00.739> there's<00:04:00.919> there's<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:01.519> way

00:04:01.719 --> 00:04:01.729 
that but I think there's there's a way

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:03.039 
that but I think there's there's a way
better<00:04:01.939> way<00:04:02.150> to<00:04:02.180> do<00:04:02.479> it<00:04:02.510> than<00:04:02.780> what<00:04:02.900> we're

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
better way to do it than what we're

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.229 
better way to do it than what we're
doing<00:04:03.319> now<00:04:03.500> what<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.159> love<00:04:04.519> about<00:04:04.639> you<00:04:04.970> is<00:04:05.000> the

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
doing now what I love about you is the

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.839 
doing now what I love about you is the
fact<00:04:05.479> that<00:04:05.599> you're<00:04:06.049> so<00:04:06.530> real<00:04:06.949> about<00:04:07.129> who<00:04:07.519> you

00:04:07.839 --> 00:04:07.849 
fact that you're so real about who you

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:09.580 
fact that you're so real about who you
are<00:04:07.879> right<00:04:08.299> I<00:04:08.329> think<00:04:08.449> people<00:04:08.989> who<00:04:09.199> are<00:04:09.229> public

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:09.590 
are right I think people who are public

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:11.710 
are right I think people who are public
figures<00:04:09.919> have<00:04:10.159> to<00:04:10.280> pretend<00:04:10.639> or<00:04:11.000> feel<00:04:11.359> the<00:04:11.540> need

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
figures have to pretend or feel the need

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.539 
figures have to pretend or feel the need
to<00:04:11.750> pretend<00:04:12.169> as<00:04:12.259> though<00:04:12.290> they're<00:04:13.069> the<00:04:13.220> best<00:04:13.400> at

00:04:13.539 --> 00:04:13.549 
to pretend as though they're the best at

to pretend as though they're the best at
everything<00:04:13.669> they<00:04:14.150> know<00:04:14.389> everything<00:04:14.750> and<00:04:15.290> they

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
everything they know everything and they

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.770 
everything they know everything and they
don't<00:04:16.280> like<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:16.759> admit<00:04:16.909> when<00:04:17.090> they<00:04:17.389> don't<00:04:17.509> know

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
don't like to admit when they don't know

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.569 
don't like to admit when they don't know
something<00:04:18.049> right<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.799> I<00:04:18.889> feel<00:04:18.919> like<00:04:19.280> you<00:04:19.489> know

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
something right and I feel like you know

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.129 
something right and I feel like you know
through<00:04:19.820> your<00:04:19.909> podcasts<00:04:20.539> really<00:04:20.810> clear<00:04:21.049> about

00:04:21.129 --> 00:04:21.139 
through your podcasts really clear about

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.890 
through your podcasts really clear about
things<00:04:21.829> that<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:22.039> don't<00:04:22.070> know<00:04:22.310> about<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:22.820> you

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
things that you don't know about and you

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.760 
things that you don't know about and you
want<00:04:23.900> more<00:04:24.200> information<00:04:24.469> about<00:04:24.979> it<00:04:25.190> and

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
want more information about it and

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:27.469 
want more information about it and
I think<00:04:25.979> that<00:04:26.099> intellectual<00:04:26.729> curiosity<00:04:26.940> is

00:04:27.469 --> 00:04:27.479 
I think that intellectual curiosity is

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:29.330 
I think that intellectual curiosity is
important<00:04:27.960> and<00:04:28.110> that<00:04:28.169> self-awareness<00:04:28.830> is

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
important and that self-awareness is

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.439 
important and that self-awareness is
important<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:29.789> know<00:04:29.879> pretend<00:04:30.210> like<00:04:30.270> you're

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:30.449 
important you know pretend like you're

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:32.719 
important you know pretend like you're
freaking<00:04:30.810> superpower<00:04:31.259> uh<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.310> that's<00:04:32.460> good

00:04:32.719 --> 00:04:32.729 
freaking superpower uh and that's good

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:34.670 
freaking superpower uh and that's good
but<00:04:33.509> the<00:04:33.569> one<00:04:33.750> thing<00:04:33.930> that<00:04:34.050> I<00:04:34.080> do<00:04:34.169> want<00:04:34.500> to<00:04:34.530> ask

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:34.680 
but the one thing that I do want to ask

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.279 
but the one thing that I do want to ask
you<00:04:34.830> about<00:04:35.039> is<00:04:35.370> you<00:04:35.699> know<00:04:35.729> how<00:04:36.300> do<00:04:36.360> you<00:04:36.659> kind<00:04:37.169> of

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
you about is you know how do you kind of

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:40.369 
you about is you know how do you kind of
recreate<00:04:38.009> a<00:04:38.039> system<00:04:38.580> when<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.629> have<00:04:39.900> such

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:40.379 
recreate a system when you have such

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.320 
recreate a system when you have such
severe<00:04:40.860> political<00:04:41.400> apathy<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:41.940> country

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
severe political apathy in the country

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.480 
severe political apathy in the country
so<00:04:42.750> let's<00:04:42.990> look<00:04:43.169> at<00:04:43.289> Los<00:04:43.470> Angeles<00:04:44.039> as<00:04:44.250> as<00:04:44.460> a

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
so let's look at Los Angeles as as a

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.279 
so let's look at Los Angeles as as a
case<00:04:44.759> study<00:04:44.789> right<00:04:45.629> now<00:04:45.780> in<00:04:45.900> Los<00:04:46.050> Angeles

00:04:46.279 --> 00:04:46.289 
case study right now in Los Angeles

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:48.920 
case study right now in Los Angeles
officials<00:04:47.250> just<00:04:47.430> voted<00:04:47.849> to<00:04:48.030> do<00:04:48.180> like<00:04:48.449> a<00:04:48.599> cash

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:48.930 
officials just voted to do like a cash

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.219 
officials just voted to do like a cash
lottery<00:04:49.590> uh<00:04:50.220> to<00:04:50.669> incentivize<00:04:51.449> voting<00:04:52.020> because

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
lottery uh to incentivize voting because

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:54.890 
lottery uh to incentivize voting because

think they believe in a system I think

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.379 
think they believe in a system I think
there's<00:05:09.000> a<00:05:09.090> lot<00:05:09.240> of<00:05:09.270> people<00:05:09.509> that<00:05:09.720> believe<00:05:10.050> in

there's a lot of people that believe in

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.159 
there's a lot of people that believe in
exactly<00:05:12.389> what<00:05:12.509> we've<00:05:12.599> been<00:05:12.690> talking<00:05:12.900> about

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:13.169 
exactly what we've been talking about

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:15.529 
exactly what we've been talking about
that<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.800> system<00:05:14.190> is<00:05:14.310> so<00:05:14.550> corrupted<00:05:15.210> and<00:05:15.360> so

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:15.539 
that the system is so corrupted and so

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:17.390 
that the system is so corrupted and so
manipulated<00:05:16.259> that<00:05:16.740> what's<00:05:16.949> the<00:05:17.039> point<00:05:17.250> in

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
manipulated that what's the point in

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.820 
manipulated that what's the point in
showing<00:05:17.669> up<00:05:17.759> and<00:05:17.880> wasting<00:05:18.240> your<00:05:18.419> time<00:05:18.750> if<00:05:19.139> all

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
showing up and wasting your time if all

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.689 
showing up and wasting your time if all
these<00:05:20.330> political<00:05:22.310> decisions<00:05:23.310> are<00:05:23.490> being

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:23.699 
these political decisions are being

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:25.939 
these political decisions are being
essentially<00:05:24.300> made<00:05:24.449> by<00:05:24.629> corporations<00:05:25.259> and<00:05:25.620> I

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
essentially made by corporations and I

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:27.980 
essentially made by corporations and I
think<00:05:26.250> there's<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.120> lot<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.419> validity<00:05:27.599> to<00:05:27.960> that

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
think there's a lot of validity to that

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.170 
think there's a lot of validity to that
if<00:05:28.500> your<00:05:28.740> time<00:05:29.099> is<00:05:29.129> very<00:05:29.400> valuable<00:05:29.520> if<00:05:30.090> you

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
if your time is very valuable if you

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.749 
if your time is very valuable if you

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770

that that was also indicative of a

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:13.159 
that that was also indicative of a
larger<00:07:11.849> issue<00:07:12.150> that<00:07:12.569> we<00:07:12.659> have<00:07:12.779> in<00:07:12.900> the<00:07:12.990> country
