00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.329
 do not 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.940
 good people here that my house recording 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.880
 and good today I bring you a new review 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.189
 about a minecraft mold called macro 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.300
 that I do not know to see many of you already 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.910
 I suppose you have played a world of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.460
 warcraft that blizzard game very 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:32.730
 famous one in mpg online a mmr 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.190
 small and it serves for good that 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.220
 you put the web to me I was wrong to see 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.050
 called the mod is called basic macro and a 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:42.269
 see is useful for when you give a 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.070
 key is executed a command from 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.680
 minecraft or for example we can give a 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 message on screen and good is configured 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.040
 in the following way as follows 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.129
 Once I had it installed you give it to 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:56.070
 options to controls and here you have a 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.049
 new window called macro settings 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.280
 we give him and well here we have everything 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:05.549
 which is the east the computer keyboard 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.320
 the ipad and for example let's try to 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.380
 sign to see in one thing before continuing 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.110
 the 'red numbers' you can not assign 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.310
 but if anything good can assign it is 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.590
 you are going to load it because for example if 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.630
 we put it in the left click when 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.030
 we try to nibble it will not sting for 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
 do it that what we put here by 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.120
 example if we put the pound network to more 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.580
 give left click dance pound 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:29.310
 this mod 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.610
 I'm telling you, it works online and 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.090
 let's try putting on the p 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.090
 hello how 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.910
 because when we put it to enter 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.680
 a being for example we give to the rock 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.440
 we greet the most enter you see him putting 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.510
 the button above also tells you what 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.550
 is assigned and for example air 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:57.260
 let's assign spam 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:59.680
 you know we have spawn so let's see 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.680
 enter the game 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.800
 well we are here in minecraft and 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:11.170
 we press the p 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:14.110
 hello how do you see it not written or anything 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.550
 not written in the chat you can follow 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.890
 putting pe that nothing happens while 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.620
 you are in writing mode we give you another 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.970
 once to the ape and put that and good now 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.460
 you remember that we put bars 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.050
 pound let's see what happens 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.360
 as you see, spam has brought us here 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.170
 well, far away we go, we're going to 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.170
 go a little bit far 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.540
 a little damage does not hurt anyone 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:40.170
 after we are enough 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:44.840
 far telesp is still there because we give it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.910
 to the pink l back to response 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.140
 it's quite interesting as you see me 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.000
 at least I had been waiting for a long time 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.280
 This is one of the few things that 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.190
 lack was missing to minecraft enzymes 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.560
 online luxury now another thing that you 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.150
 I wanted to teach is macro controls 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.590
 settings vale you see that we have everything here 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.840
 the keyboard we can not assign to 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.819
 any to any letter this is 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.379
 saves everything in a file called is 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.959
 here with fit default if we click 

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.170
 we see that we have the to see we have the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.670
 default config is worth this options already 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.340
 in passing do not touch them because they are good 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:17.110
 all configured 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:21.599
 ok let's add a new file 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.599
 custom call 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.690
 here is a h a new vais to see look 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.580
 we give it to ok and now we do not have a the 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.130
 peni the assigned l because it is a file 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.540
 totally different configuration 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.950
 ok if we give it back to the default 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:39.730
 config ok 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.050
 we have the battery l worth that is what 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.820
 I wanted to mention this we're going to 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.550
 deleted because it was good will 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.230
 assign one for you to see it we are going to 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.810
 assign to the tail 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:56.970
 and now he has something assigned hello 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.970
 and the default combi that has the l and the p 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.500
 now what do you want to teach in 

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:05.090
 principle that he wanted from his passing life 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.940
 that is, this is 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.260
 you see here macro billings case if you see 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.120
 you have here in the option to go to the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.549
 right and you open a new menu 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.410
 what does it mean that it shows something in 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:20.660
 screen or even make a command when 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:23.560
 some of this is true for example 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.560
 whatever is 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:30.260
 when when oxygen changes 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.260
 help drown me 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:37.550
 I'm dying 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:40.250
 ok it 's in yellow and you put it 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:44.290
 help me die I'm dying look when the 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.290
 life also helps 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:49.289
 this for a pvp server would be very 

00:04:47.759 --> 00:04:53.120
 well the truth I at least see it 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.660
 so now we go again to the game 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.660
 wrong 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.849
 here down there is water let's throw ourselves 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:04.940
 alauita much zone 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.300
 wish for a little bit me wrong 

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:10.580
 well this was not expected people to 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.730
 see that I do not know what has happened 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.040
 good is worth that option is still a 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:20.580
 little buff 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:22.919
 my mother see a moment they kill me son 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.319

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:28.669
 that I see is still very low do not touch 

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:28.669
 a lot that option of water 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:34.600
 if we leave it empty better if it's going to be 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:34.600
 best 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.729
 multiplayer klaus eder 

00:05:40.129 --> 00:05:44.199
 you have to wait for the moment with this 

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:50.900
 several so much 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.080
 let's go up we're already here another 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.580
 time 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.260
 Well now let's do a little bit 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:06:01.290
 of damage so you can see how it is shown 

00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:01.290
 on the screen we remove the carmen morte 

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:09.440
 and well we are like any player 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:11.389
 main of minecraft as we fall and 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:14.120
