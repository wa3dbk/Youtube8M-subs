and just push see where I can push it on
the<00:02:10.129> back<00:02:11.769> so<00:02:12.769> probably<00:02:13.160> about<00:02:13.340> right<00:02:13.549> there

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
the back so probably about right there

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:17.020

and push the front same way back just
rolling<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.829> to<00:02:22.069> probably<00:02:22.519> about<00:02:22.760> right<00:02:22.970> there

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:23.269

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
is extremely thick it doesn't that be

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.150 
is extremely thick it doesn't that be
tangled<00:04:09.360> so<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:09.900> not<00:04:10.230> going<00:04:10.530> to<00:04:10.650> go<00:04:10.770> all<00:04:11.010> the

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
tangled so it's not going to go all the

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.840 
tangled so it's not going to go all the
way<00:04:11.190> in<00:04:12.290> unfortunately<00:04:13.310> so<00:04:14.310> I'm<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.640> pushing

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
way in unfortunately so I'm just pushing

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:19.640 
way in unfortunately so I'm just pushing
it<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.270> there<00:04:15.450> ah<00:04:17.840> and<00:04:18.840> as<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.080> can<00:04:19.230> see<00:04:19.410> I<00:04:19.440> have

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:19.650 
it to there ah and as you can see I have

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:21.259 
it to there ah and as you can see I have
my<00:04:19.799> little<00:04:19.830> pump<00:04:20.430> right<00:04:20.580> there<00:04:20.820> it<00:04:20.910> actually

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
my little pump right there it actually

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.900 
my little pump right there it actually
looks<00:04:21.480> pretty<00:04:21.600> good<00:04:21.900> I<00:04:22.109> do<00:04:22.260> like<00:04:22.590> it<00:04:22.830> but<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.670> do

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
looks pretty good I do like it but I do

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.470 
looks pretty good I do like it but I do
take<00:04:24.390> also<00:04:24.660> just<00:04:25.110> because<00:04:26.090> to<00:04:27.090> give<00:04:27.240> a<00:04:27.270> little

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
take also just because to give a little

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.150 
take also just because to give a little
more<00:04:27.630> security<00:04:28.050> since<00:04:28.290> it<00:04:28.440> is<00:04:28.530> that<00:04:28.680> comb<00:04:28.950> and

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
more security since it is that comb and

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.010 
more security since it is that comb and
it's<00:04:29.280> not<00:04:29.430> going<00:04:29.670> all<00:04:29.760> the<00:04:29.880> way<00:04:29.910> in<00:04:30.180> and<00:04:30.840> I'll

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
it's not going all the way in and I'll

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.320 
it's not going all the way in and I'll
take<00:04:31.290> a<00:04:31.320> piece<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:31.860> actually<00:04:32.160> at<00:04:32.580> the<00:04:32.850> edges

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330
