00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
spring first this thing the spring is

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.109 
spring first this thing the spring is
pretty<00:01:13.200> strong<00:01:13.530> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.369> see<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.580> bent<00:01:14.820> all

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
pretty strong you can see it bent all

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.240 
pretty strong you can see it bent all
the<00:01:15.420> way<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.290> as<00:01:16.409> much<00:01:16.439> as<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> should

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the way this is as much as it should

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
ever Bend because that's where the table

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.590 
ever Bend because that's where the table
usually<00:01:19.560> will<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.909> right<00:01:20.909> on<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> suction<00:01:21.360> cup

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.380 
gonna punch it lightly let's say when
you<00:01:28.560> punch<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:28.920> doesn't<00:01:29.220> always<00:01:29.400> go<00:01:29.670> directly

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390

straight you see when you punch it like
this<00:01:34.020> at<00:01:34.259> least<00:01:35.299> you<00:01:36.299> know<00:01:36.390> expert<00:01:36.810> but<00:01:37.140> yeah

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
this at least you know expert but yeah

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.490 
this at least you know expert but yeah
and<00:01:38.119> you<00:01:39.119> can<00:01:39.299> punch<00:01:39.509> it<00:01:39.659> pretty<00:01:39.900> hard<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
and you can punch it pretty hard and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.810 
and you can punch it pretty hard and
just<00:01:41.009> gonna<00:01:41.220> do<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.400> now

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
just gonna do that now

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:48.230 
just gonna do that now
I'm<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.780> strongest<00:01:43.619> person<00:01:44.060> yeah<00:01:47.000> you<00:01:48.000> punch

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
I'm not strongest person yeah you punch

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.080 
I'm not strongest person yeah you punch
it<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:48.630> hard<00:01:49.399> so<00:01:52.130> you<00:01:53.130> think<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.579> suction

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it really hard so you think the suction

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.139 
it really hard so you think the suction
cup<00:01:54.270> though<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.380> it<00:01:55.740> doesn't<00:01:56.070> stand<00:01:56.820> wall

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
cup though is that it doesn't stand wall

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.370 
cup though is that it doesn't stand wall
as<00:01:57.390> well<00:01:58.430> because<00:01:59.430> gravity<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.390> know<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.229> already

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
as well because gravity I know I already

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
as well because gravity I know I already
said<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.860> won't<00:02:01.950> stick<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:02.310> paint<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
said it won't stick to paint and

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.100 
said it won't stick to paint and
wallpaper<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.270> gravity<00:02:03.659> will<00:02:03.750> pull<00:02:03.780> this

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
wallpaper but gravity will pull this

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.510 
wallpaper but gravity will pull this
thing<00:02:04.409> down<00:02:04.439> cuz<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:04.979> gets<00:02:05.070> pretty<00:02:05.280> heavy

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
thing down cuz it gets pretty heavy

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.760 
thing down cuz it gets pretty heavy
