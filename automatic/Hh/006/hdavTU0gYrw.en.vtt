00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:15.220 

ok<00:00:10.349> this<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.740> a<00:00:10.889> smaller<00:00:11.309> bodice<00:00:12.059> that<00:00:12.389> I<00:00:13.380> have

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
ok this is a smaller bodice that I have

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.439 
ok this is a smaller bodice that I have
and<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.500> included<00:00:18.980> my<00:00:19.980> going<00:00:20.880> books<00:00:21.150> in<00:00:21.330> my

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
and it's included my going books in my

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.070 
and it's included my going books in my
pattern<00:00:21.869> making<00:00:22.080> bit<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:23.630> I'm<00:00:24.630> gonna<00:00:24.810> trace

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
pattern making bit so I'm gonna trace

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.599 
pattern making bit so I'm gonna trace
this<00:00:25.350> just<00:00:25.740> as<00:00:25.949> an<00:00:26.160> example<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.970> to<00:00:27.029> really

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
this just as an example not to really

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.120 
this just as an example not to really
raise<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.359> know<00:00:30.510> this<00:00:31.380> is<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.679> big<00:00:31.949> your

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
raise that you know this is how big your

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.410 
raise that you know this is how big your
bodice<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> but<00:00:33.140> just<00:00:34.140> as<00:00:34.320> an<00:00:34.530> example<00:00:35.210> this<00:00:36.210> is

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
bodice is but just as an example this is

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.200 
bodice is but just as an example this is
what<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.829> even<00:00:37.829> when<00:00:37.950> I'm<00:00:38.100> not<00:00:38.210> interfacing

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
what I do even when I'm not interfacing

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.450 
what I do even when I'm not interfacing
a<00:00:39.390> piece<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> fabric<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:40.350> always<00:00:40.620> trace<00:00:41.129> around

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
a piece of fabric I always trace around

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.190 
a piece of fabric I always trace around
my<00:00:42.300> pattern<00:00:42.750> piece<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.739> can<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.399> better

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
my pattern piece you can get a better

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.880 
my pattern piece you can get a better
cut<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> pattern<00:00:47.610> piece<00:00:48.079> by<00:00:49.079> tracing<00:00:49.530> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
cut of the pattern piece by tracing it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.420 
cut of the pattern piece by tracing it
then<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.670> can<00:00:50.969> if<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.629> pin<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.320> then<00:00:53.190> cut

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
then you can if you pin it and then cut

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.670 
then you can if you pin it and then cut
it<00:00:53.989> so<00:00:54.989> that's<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.789> little<00:00:56.789> tip<00:00:57.680> for

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
it so that's just a little tip for

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.639 
it so that's just a little tip for
anybody<00:00:59.129> who's<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.730> starting<00:01:00.260> any<00:01:01.260> of<00:01:01.469> us

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
anybody who's just starting any of us

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.810 
anybody who's just starting any of us
who<00:01:01.859> aren't<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:03.000> sure<00:01:04.129> why<00:01:05.129> our<00:01:05.339> patterns

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
who aren't really sure why our patterns

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.050 
who aren't really sure why our patterns
keep<00:01:06.060> coming<00:01:06.360> out<00:01:06.450> funny-shaped<00:01:07.520> and<00:01:08.520> they

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
keep coming out funny-shaped and they

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.460 
keep coming out funny-shaped and they
don't<00:01:09.270> look<00:01:09.510> like<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:09.900> garment<00:01:12.049> so<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.229> this

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
don't look like the garment so do this

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:23.649 
don't look like the garment so do this
will<00:01:14.189> speed<00:01:14.369> up<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.850> little<00:01:14.880> bit

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:36.080 

this<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> a<00:01:24.869> perfect<00:01:33.710> okay<00:01:34.710> so<00:01:35.610> this<00:01:35.759> is<00:01:35.939> our

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
this is a perfect okay so this is our

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.179 
this is a perfect okay so this is our
pattern<00:01:36.509> shape<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:37.380> you<00:01:37.439> see<00:01:37.770> we've<00:01:37.979> already

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
pattern shape so you see we've already

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.899 
pattern shape so you see we've already
interfaced<00:01:39.090> it<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.289> we<00:01:40.500> don't<00:01:40.530> need<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.189> really

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
interfaced it so we don't need to really

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.809 
interfaced it so we don't need to really
do<00:01:42.090> anything<00:01:42.119> else<00:01:42.869> now<00:01:43.860> we<00:01:43.920> just<00:01:44.280> need<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.579> cut

00:01:44.809 --> 00:01:44.819 
do anything else now we just need to cut

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.830 
do anything else now we just need to cut
it<00:01:45.049> and<00:01:46.049> we<00:01:46.500> cut<00:01:46.679> all<00:01:46.950> right<00:01:47.100> all<00:01:47.220> right<00:01:47.250> now<00:01:48.030> if

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
it and we cut all right all right now if

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.330 
it and we cut all right all right now if
I<00:01:49.200> was<00:01:49.470> peace<00:01:49.799> interfacing<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.909> I<00:01:52.340> would

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I was peace interfacing this I would

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.859 
I was peace interfacing this I would
make<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.549> pattern<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.119> how<00:01:54.360> we<00:01:54.420> learned<00:01:54.720> in

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
make a pattern that's how we learned in

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.469 
make a pattern that's how we learned in
school<00:01:55.020> that<00:01:55.200> is<00:01:55.770> one-eighth<00:01:56.670> smaller<00:01:57.119> all

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
school that is one-eighth smaller all

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.940 
school that is one-eighth smaller all
the<00:01:57.659> way<00:01:57.780> around<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.759> pattern<00:02:00.950> would

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the way around so my pattern would

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.490 
the way around so my pattern would
actually<00:02:02.490> be<00:02:02.670> close<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.689> looking<00:02:04.020> like<00:02:04.229> this

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
actually be close to looking like this

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.289 
actually be close to looking like this
and<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.039> is<00:02:05.220> just<00:02:05.250> me<00:02:05.520> quick<00:02:05.759> drawing<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
and this is just me quick drawing it

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:14.569 
and this is just me quick drawing it
this<00:02:06.990> isn't<00:02:07.409> me<00:02:07.530> actually<00:02:07.770> done<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:14.220> most

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:14.579 
this isn't me actually done now most

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.890 
this isn't me actually done now most
times<00:02:14.940> on<00:02:15.540> your<00:02:16.079> father's<00:02:16.739> pattern<00:02:17.660> you<00:02:18.660> don't

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
times on your father's pattern you don't

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.490 
times on your father's pattern you don't
have<00:02:19.970> this<00:02:20.970> big<00:02:21.269> gap<00:02:21.599> right<00:02:21.870> here<00:02:21.930> it's

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
have this big gap right here it's

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.039 
have this big gap right here it's
usually<00:02:22.769> filled<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.760> you<00:02:24.599> have<00:02:24.810> seen

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
usually filled in or you have seen

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.099 
usually filled in or you have seen
allowances<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.190> either<00:02:27.180> way<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:27.989> to

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
allowances so either way it's going to

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:29.690 
allowances so either way it's going to
follow<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.470> edge<00:02:28.620> so<00:02:28.920> if<00:02:29.100> this<00:02:29.340> edge<00:02:29.640> is

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
follow the edge so if this edge is

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.080 
follow the edge so if this edge is
joined<00:02:30.480> then<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.890> will<00:02:32.280> actually<00:02:32.430> follow<00:02:32.790> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
joined then it will actually follow the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.009 
joined then it will actually follow the
edge<00:02:33.239> so<00:02:33.750> that's<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.260> difference<00:02:34.500> but<00:02:35.489> um

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
edge so that's the difference but um

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.920 
edge so that's the difference but um
let's<00:02:37.019> see<00:02:37.579> what<00:02:38.579> else<00:02:38.609> do<00:02:39.090> to<00:02:39.239> do<00:02:39.359> to<00:02:39.389> do<00:02:39.690> so

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
let's see what else do to do to do so

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.750 
let's see what else do to do to do so
that's<00:02:40.230> done<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:40.980> this<00:02:41.190> is<00:02:41.370> how<00:02:41.549> my

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
that's done but this is how my

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.640 
that's done but this is how my
interfacing<00:02:42.569> pattern<00:02:42.900> with<00:02:43.049> looks<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.470> would

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
interfacing pattern with looks I would

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.770 
interfacing pattern with looks I would
cut<00:02:43.829> those<00:02:43.980> exchange<00:02:44.489> off<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:45.150> would<00:02:45.389> just<00:02:45.420> be

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
cut those exchange off it would just be

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:49.340 
cut those exchange off it would just be
this<00:02:46.049> inner<00:02:46.440> area<00:02:47.180> now<00:02:48.180> and<00:02:48.630> when<00:02:48.780> I<00:02:48.810> put<00:02:49.079> it<00:02:49.200> on

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
this inner area now and when I put it on

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.640 
this inner area now and when I put it on
here<00:02:49.889> it's<00:02:50.579> going<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> be<00:02:51.030> smaller<00:02:51.440> so<00:02:52.440> when<00:02:52.620> I

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
here it's going to be smaller so when I

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.610 
here it's going to be smaller so when I
actually<00:02:52.950> go<00:02:53.459> and<00:02:53.870> try<00:02:54.870> to<00:02:54.900> interface<00:02:55.440> it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
actually go and try to interface it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.590 
actually go and try to interface it
interfaces<00:02:56.280> really<00:02:56.790> well<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.180> holds<00:02:57.600> good<00:02:57.840> ok

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
interfaces really well and holds good ok

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.809 
interfaces really well and holds good ok
so<00:03:00.600> that<00:03:00.959> is<00:03:00.989> it<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.859> then<00:03:02.100> all<00:03:02.280> I<00:03:02.370> have<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.670> do

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:02.819 
so that is it and then all I have to do

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.729 
so that is it and then all I have to do
this<00:03:03.450> cut<00:03:03.810> this<00:03:03.989> out<00:03:05.750> and<00:03:06.750> maybe<00:03:06.959> I<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.500> some

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
this cut this out and maybe I have some

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.410 
this cut this out and maybe I have some
other<00:03:07.859> pieces<00:03:08.690> it's<00:03:09.690> like<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.319> know

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
other pieces it's like you know

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.140 
other pieces it's like you know
something<00:03:12.420> that<00:03:12.630> looks<00:03:12.840> like<00:03:12.959> this<00:03:13.079> and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
something that looks like this and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.900 
something that looks like this and
another<00:03:15.150> piece<00:03:15.569> and<00:03:16.109> another<00:03:16.410> piece<00:03:16.760> so<00:03:17.760> all

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
another piece and another piece so all

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.390 
another piece and another piece so all
these<00:03:18.060> other<00:03:18.299> pieces<00:03:18.600> are<00:03:19.440> being<00:03:19.799> blackfuse

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
these other pieces are being blackfuse

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.670 
these other pieces are being blackfuse
at<00:03:20.730> the<00:03:20.849> same<00:03:21.090> time<00:03:21.359> then<00:03:21.989> I'll<00:03:22.109> just<00:03:22.290> cut<00:03:22.530> my

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
at the same time then I'll just cut my

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.580 
at the same time then I'll just cut my
pieces<00:03:22.980> out<00:03:23.310> and<00:03:23.900> basically<00:03:24.900> this<00:03:25.200> will<00:03:25.440> be

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
pieces out and basically this will be

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.229 
pieces out and basically this will be
fused<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.280> to<00:03:26.459> the<00:03:26.579> edge<00:03:26.730> of<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.030> garment

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
fused right to the edge of the garment

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.330 
fused right to the edge of the garment
but<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:27.750> how<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:27.989> get<00:03:28.200> around<00:03:28.380> that<00:03:28.799> if

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
but that's how you get around that if

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.249 
but that's how you get around that if
you<00:03:29.790> like<00:03:30.000> your<00:03:30.030> piece<00:03:30.389> of<00:03:30.569> fuse<00:03:30.780> all<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.139> way

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:31.259 
you like your piece of fuse all the way

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.289 
you like your piece of fuse all the way
to<00:03:31.320> the<00:03:31.530> edge<00:03:31.680> then<00:03:32.220> block<00:03:32.820> Steve's<00:03:33.150> your

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
to the edge then block Steve's your

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.850 
to the edge then block Steve's your
pieces<00:03:33.509> so

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
pieces so

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.000 
pieces so
anyway<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.790> is
