00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello to all and nono 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.029
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.040
 video of three very nice traps on 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.380
 minecraft so the first one will consist 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.210
 to make a trap that opens a door 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.219
 and we fall into a hole what you 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.800
 want hole in the layer of soil or 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.900
 just hole that can be locked up then 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.830
 we are going to start we are putting ourselves on a 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.490
 flat surface 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.769
 here we are going to dig one two three four 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.010
 here and in this hole we will put the 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.109
 sticky pistols here and right behind 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.520
 the tracks in sticky one will dig 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.640
 again and we'll put some 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.040
 Redstone torches and there there there there there 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.000
 no sorry here it is you see there 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.520
 here for example here I push in 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.149
 games but lara stone behind finally l 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.010
 inverter if I press it does nothing and if 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.750
 swore then sees the workers of a class 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.879
 would push for demonstrations for crazy 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.020
 here we are going to try like that it makes a 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.670
 hole now we will redo the same I 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.449
 do not know I think it's on this side 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.040
 that's it 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.950
 wait wait 2 3 that's how 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.119
 like that and I think it's going to be 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:21.030
 as was waiting a little bit here we are 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:24.390
 done like that normally will cease and not 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.159
 I was wrong so wait this is 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.549
 just one more than it takes 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.090
 dig 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.970
 here we put our stuff that 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.450
 quietly 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:38.900
 this is momentum but the standard watch but 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.840
 a little bit of redstone there the inverter 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.649
 and there we will put stone there and 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.130
 wait and I believe I still 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:52.130
 deceived wait what to do a test 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.640
 Not here it's good I'm not 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.130
 deceived so now you have 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.410
 your thing if not simple here is there 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.390
 on top you see a hole then the hole 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.690
 we will dig up to 3 here you are 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.210
 here 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.390
 and here you go, see enough to 3 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:19.240
 quay quietly here now if 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.820
 I close and I look at you and 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:27.040
 you see a hole in this hole on 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:28.480
 is going to put water here I had so 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.420
 I'm a little it says you're going 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.670
 see that it's going to give to cut 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.440
 excuse me a little bug here 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.530
 now before we'll put two 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.330
 iron doors were going to have and on the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.420
 sides we'll go around like that 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.380
 fake 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.700
 and there you see it's done a trick 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:48.940
 close need 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.300
 there we will put like that two things 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:57.060
 behind at 2 here and there we will put a 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:59.650
 lever and then here are some news 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.140
 remove the levers and now we're going 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.840
 connect the red stone to the lever lever 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.660
 lavender put it like that as 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.340
 it like that like that and that's it 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.290
 there as you see it is to connect everything 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.830
 is connected quietly we will see if 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.680
 it works 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.190
 here and if I activate the door it goes 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.290
 open 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.450
 and here you see that it's okay 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.030
 fall into a hole 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.730
 as you can see by 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:25.959
 example I'm nice without it big 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.680
 that he was expecting me I put myself in 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:35.230
 survival voice the voice help the survival 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:39.010
 I advance I advance and a door here I 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:40.810
 will open and poop the chips and I do not 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.920
 can no longer come back here after you 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.090
 can put the beautiful dress for not 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.780
 that the mes going back 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.900
 that's wait, I'm going back to fashion 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.959
 here 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.980
 and that was the first trap that 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:53.950
 I show you 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.470
 it's the trap of the fall months that 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.360
 I call it after another trap well 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:03.340
 nice funny here I like 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:05.139
 then you need sand a plate 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.080
 of pressure in my opinion I believe it 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:11.769
 is known this trap and tnt 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:14.629
 so if I remember well it's them 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:17.870
 that's it you dig a hole here 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:22.250
 big like that the cellars not me you 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.860
 go put here you put tnt 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:28.190
 sand and a pressure plate is 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.970
 there since sand is and it's risky 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.910
 not gravity 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.789
 so that's it, then that's it 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:38.570
 bother you for the tnt with and poor 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:40.760
 I explode that's another trap so he 

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.550
 you just need to show yourself well the 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.840
 trap so wait I'm riding next door 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:49.460
 you dig a hole any 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:53.690
 greatness here's finally here you put 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.340
 the tnt to the second is put sand 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:56.449
 and a pressure plate but that's it 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.940
 when you walk you will fall 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:02.000
 on it you will fall it will fall and 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.639
 you are going to die here now a 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.910
 another trap the trap for locking up the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:10.900
 people so wait five seconds I 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:10.900
 look at something 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:19.520
 excuse me for the little bug then 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.250
 it's okay I'm coming back so I'll go 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:25.460
 show then already you need pistons 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:27.500
 sticky you put some you put some 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.760
 color stone you put abroad 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:33.380
 2.5 out of seven rows of five 

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.300
 the first one you put not put you 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:38.930
 on the second one here and you put on 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:43.400
 this is just like that 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:46.430
 ah yeah here and in front you go 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:51.020
 put a comberton thing you was 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.030
 that's good now here 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.010
 we have our thing good if you want 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:00.860
 I put you like that like we know 

00:05:55.010 --> 00:06:03.380
 that the piston here is now here we go 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.370
 put a pressure plate underneath 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:07.460
 of this pressure joke we're going 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.620
 dig and we'll put art ti 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:13.300
 tons and the red stone we're going there connected 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:19.150
 with this little trick 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:23.870
 here we connect so that's good 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.870
 but this wali here you are 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.560
 and that's it when you can see if 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:33.560
 although I expected and supports up bin 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.010
 this is a little bug if I support sama 

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.290
 year fixed 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:38.990
 here I am now close to 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:41.000
 do the same for the other side then 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:45.050
 the other side it's going to be the same 

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:52.610
 like that we're going well fair then 

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:54.110
 that they have to do here you can 

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:58.010
 see it and now we will connect 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:01.010
 like this again now 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:04.040
 we read again and here we still have the red 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:07.430
 stone we take we put a block of 

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:09.740
 coubertin for charlie faster here 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:11.960
 as you can see that it's good 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:13.640
 now makes wood turn 

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:21.860
 to see where they are the pistons 

00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:23.240
 of that then there there there there and there 

00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:28.639
 that's it's good 

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:31.030
 do it like that I'm going to do a 

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:31.030
 small roof 

00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:39.840
 so here you can see I have two 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:41.900
 blocks flop when I put myself and there I 

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:43.860
 can not go out anymore 

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:44.970
 afterwards if you want for example on the 

00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:46.710
 side you can put rock label 

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.600
 it's even better because like that 

00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:50.090
 it can stop him from going out if the guy 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:52.919
 he is in survival mode 

00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:54.690
 so that was nono for a 

00:07:52.919 --> 00:07:57.960
 presentation of three small traps the 

00:07:54.690 --> 00:08:01.440
 trap of the fall trap of the fall 

00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:02.820
 also but that you die and and the trap 

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:07.520
 leaving firm 

00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:07.520
 so that was nono at the next
