00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:07.529 
new computer setup that I used mostly

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.339 
new computer setup that I used mostly
for<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:08.340> my<00:00:09.000> web<00:00:09.210> design<00:00:09.570> and<00:00:09.780> business<00:00:09.960> stuff

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
for I my web design and business stuff

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.560 
for I my web design and business stuff
but<00:00:10.580> they<00:00:11.580> could<00:00:11.759> tear<00:00:12.000> through<00:00:12.269> pretty<00:00:12.480> much

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
but they could tear through pretty much

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.039 
but they could tear through pretty much
any<00:00:12.960> game<00:00:13.259> pretty<00:00:13.679> easily<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.809> here's<00:00:15.809> what<00:00:15.990> I

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
any game pretty easily so here's what I

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859 
any game pretty easily so here's what I
got<00:00:16.400> it's<00:00:17.400> actually<00:00:17.760> not<00:00:17.880> a<00:00:17.940> desktop<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:18.779> a

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
got it's actually not a desktop it's a

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.250 
got it's actually not a desktop it's a
my<00:00:19.800> laptop<00:00:20.369> that<00:00:20.699> supports<00:00:21.180> off<00:00:21.420> for<00:00:21.840> all

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
my laptop that supports off for all

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.609 
my laptop that supports off for all
monitors<00:00:23.010> simultaneously<00:00:24.560> absolutely<00:00:25.560> if

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
monitors simultaneously absolutely if

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.259 
monitors simultaneously absolutely if
our<00:00:25.800> daisy<00:00:26.039> chain<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.490> disciplic<00:00:26.699> or<00:00:27.090> i<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
our daisy chain of disciplic or i can

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:33.229 
our daisy chain of disciplic or i can
get<00:00:27.769> five<00:00:28.769> monitors<00:00:29.340> at<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.609> same<00:00:29.820> time<00:00:32.239> have

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
get five monitors at the same time have

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.170 
get five monitors at the same time have
an<00:00:34.200> asus<00:00:35.690> g75vw<00:00:37.640> this<00:00:38.640> thing's<00:00:38.879> pretty<00:00:39.059> cool

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
an asus g75vw this thing's pretty cool

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.530 
an asus g75vw this thing's pretty cool
because<00:00:40.219> the<00:00:41.219> main<00:00:41.399> reason<00:00:41.670> i<00:00:41.760> like<00:00:42.000> is<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.360> has

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
because the main reason i like is it has

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.279 
because the main reason i like is it has
three<00:00:43.200> video<00:00:43.879> outputs<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> hdmi<00:00:45.809> vga

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
three video outputs which is hdmi vga

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.630 
three video outputs which is hdmi vga
and<00:00:47.660> DisplayPort<00:00:49.039> and<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.129> can<00:00:50.280> daisy-chain

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
and DisplayPort and you can daisy-chain

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.760 
and DisplayPort and you can daisy-chain
the<00:00:50.969> display<00:00:51.360> for<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> to<00:00:51.840> get<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.440> monitors

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
the display for it to get two monitors

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.760 
the display for it to get two monitors
out<00:00:53.039> of<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.309> but<00:00:54.030> uh<00:00:54.090> if<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:55.050> want<00:00:55.230> to<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.620> you

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
out of it but uh if you want to if you

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.880 
out of it but uh if you want to if you
want<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:55.980> be<00:00:56.070> able<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.309> use<00:00:56.520> all<00:00:57.500> four<00:00:58.500> displays

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
want to be able to use all four displays

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.349 
want to be able to use all four displays
at<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.129> same<00:00:59.340> time<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.760> have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.940> make<00:01:00.180> sure

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
at the same time you have to make sure

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.889 
at the same time you have to make sure
you<00:01:00.449> get<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.980> gtx<00:01:01.980> 660m<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:03.120> not<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> six<00:01:03.660> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
you get the gtx 660m and not the six of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.950 
you get the gtx 660m and not the six of
670m<00:01:04.890> because<00:01:05.400> of<00:01:05.580> 670m<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.450> based<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.840> the

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
670m because of 670m is based on the

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
670m because of 670m is based on the
older<00:01:07.260> Fermi<00:01:07.590> architecture<00:01:08.340> um<00:01:10.159> so<00:01:11.159> here's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
older Fermi architecture um so here's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.490 
older Fermi architecture um so here's
the<00:01:11.549> specs<00:01:11.820> on<00:01:12.030> computer<00:01:13.760> see<00:01:14.930> it's<00:01:15.930> got<00:01:16.229> a

identical<00:01:43.770> monitors<00:01:44.310> but<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.880> don't<00:01:45.869> you<00:01:46.020> can't

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
identical monitors but i don't you can't

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.899 
identical monitors but i don't you can't
tell<00:01:46.530> what<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> camera<00:01:47.369> but<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.700> color

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
tell what the camera but the color

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.450 
tell what the camera but the color
profiles<00:01:48.420> are<00:01:48.630> very<00:01:49.350> slightly<00:01:49.860> off<00:01:50.159> which

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
profiles are very slightly off which

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.160 
profiles are very slightly off which
kind<00:01:50.729> of<00:01:50.759> makes<00:01:50.939> up<00:01:51.149> pain<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.600> ass<00:01:51.720> we're
