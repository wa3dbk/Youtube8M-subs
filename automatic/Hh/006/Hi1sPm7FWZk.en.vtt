00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.850
 not in fact the solar system has been decided by union scientists 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.000
 astronomical international meeting in prague only eight pastures will have the 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.139
 category of the planet, which will force the revision of textbooks 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.489
 change little by little what many of us learned 

00:00:13.489 --> 00:00:17.320
 the sellers and they have agreed on what is a planet 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.789
 and the great harmed has been pluton that after 76 years among the 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.819
 big has dropped category 

00:00:23.819 --> 00:00:28.069
 the scientists already knew that he was a different teacher to the rest but everything 

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:29.080
 the latter 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 highlights an area in which there are gaseous rocky planets instructor and that's why 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.490
 sometimes people suspect that they really were not born there now there will be three 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.200
 families of planets the eight classic mercury venus earth mars jupiter 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.400
 saturn urano inept 1 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.490
 the asteroids and the dwarfs like pluton and dinner 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:54.230
 The main advantage of this classification is that it makes the 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 requirements to be a planet be big round my turn around the 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.980
 Sun of the problem you're going to have this 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 he is discovering new ports poles of ascÃ³ almost all the 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.340
 days 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.000
 the list of planets and will continue to increase the little brother of the 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.650
 smaller solar system even than our moon 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.000
 will continue to orbit around the sun oblivious to its new category that 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.430
 we will have to revise textbooks and we will not have to exclude pluton from 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 that list of planets that we memorized when we were children 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.290
 in our land to Mars Jupiter Saturn Uranus Neptune 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:35.300
 the apostles and almost by boat even in the city of prague 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.820
 in the Czech capital today the members of the international astronomical union of 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.560
 cinemas and pluton ceases to be considered a planet because of its reduced 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.860
 proportions that is for its critics of the solar system it seems that 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.810
 the size does matter 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.299
 It has 2 thousand 300 kilometers in diameter over 70 years of history 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.179
 and even his own moon but in the casting of planets all this is not enough 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.650
 Pluto could stop being a planet this afternoon 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.910
 the international astronomical union debates these days in prague a new 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.460
 definition of planet 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.500
 the solar system could be reduced other members the slaughtered 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:19.189
 the problem has been that it has been discovered 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.719
 more bodies 

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:26.180
 greater than pluton for which they had more right to be planets than it exploded 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.309
 had to make a determination 

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:33.329
 and put the fence dividing planets from the planets somewhere a 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.419
 change that will bring important consequences will have to change manuals 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:40.259
 encyclopedias and thousands of school books 

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:44.109
 but it also means a step forward has universal knowledge 

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:50.829
 this afternoon we will know the final decision already in 1999 pluton exceeded a 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:55.599
 similar crisis in which he was about to become an asteroid this time not 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.219
 will have more difficult everything seems to indicate that it will be condemned to be a 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:00.879
 dwarf planet
