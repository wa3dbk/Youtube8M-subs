today we're going to answer some of the

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.370 
today we're going to answer some of the
questions<00:00:10.730> technically<00:00:11.300> speaking<00:00:11.540> as<00:00:11.870> far<00:00:12.110> as

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
questions technically speaking as far as

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.330 
questions technically speaking as far as
some<00:00:13.040> look

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
some look

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.100 
some look
frequently<00:00:14.910> asked<00:00:15.120> us<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:15.630> one<00:00:15.960> of<00:00:16.050> the

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:16.110 
frequently asked us and one of the

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.860 
frequently asked us and one of the
questions<00:00:16.470> that<00:00:16.590> we<00:00:16.680> get<00:00:16.860> is<00:00:17.420> what<00:00:18.420> kind<00:00:18.720> of

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:18.870 
questions that we get is what kind of

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.280 
questions that we get is what kind of
hydraulic<00:00:19.410> fluid<00:00:19.530> do<00:00:19.860> I<00:00:19.920> put<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.430> my<00:00:20.580> machine

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:21.290 
hydraulic fluid do I put in my machine

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:24.790 
hydraulic fluid do I put in my machine
that's<00:00:22.290> a<00:00:22.380> great<00:00:22.619> question<00:00:23.130> because<00:00:23.779> people

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:24.800 
that's a great question because people

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.760 
that's a great question because people
in<00:00:25.800> the<00:00:25.890> past<00:00:26.100> have<00:00:26.400> asked<00:00:26.640> me<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.119> lot<00:00:27.390> and

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
in the past have asked me that a lot and

in the past have asked me that a lot and
they<00:00:28.770> typically<00:00:29.369> think<00:00:29.580> hydraulic<00:00:30.060> oil<00:00:30.270> is

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:30.450 
they typically think hydraulic oil is

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.120 
they typically think hydraulic oil is
hydraulic<00:00:30.960> oil<00:00:31.259> right<00:00:31.439> so<00:00:31.770> I<00:00:31.800> can<00:00:31.919> put

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
hydraulic oil right so I can put
