00:02:05.379 --> 00:02:05.389 
here's the center here so let's just get

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:09.790 
here's the center here so let's just get
out<00:02:05.539> of<00:02:05.569> fly<00:02:05.749> mode<00:02:06.969> you<00:02:07.969> can<00:02:07.999> see<00:02:08.420> how<00:02:08.600> tall<00:02:08.800> is

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
out of fly mode you can see how tall is

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:10.960 
out of fly mode you can see how tall is
creation<00:02:10.100> is<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.459> now<00:02:10.550> we're<00:02:10.700> going<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:10.880> go

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
creation is and now we're going to go

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.000 
creation is and now we're going to go
back<00:02:11.000> into<00:02:11.150> fly<00:02:11.630> mode<00:02:11.840> if<00:02:12.200> I<00:02:12.350> straight<00:02:12.830> through

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
back into fly mode if I straight through

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.630 
back into fly mode if I straight through
the<00:02:13.100> center<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.430> this<00:02:13.640> creation<00:02:15.459> which<00:02:16.459> is

light off right now this is what it
would<00:02:26.480> look<00:02:26.540> like<00:02:26.689> so<00:02:27.170> that's<00:02:27.349> just<00:02:27.470> really

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
would look like so that's just really

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.490 
would look like so that's just really
how<00:02:27.950> big<00:02:28.129> this<00:02:28.250> creation<00:02:28.519> is

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500 
how big this creation is

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:34.760 
how big this creation is
and<00:02:31.500> sort<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.430> top<00:02:33.110> to<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.260> to<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> top<00:02:34.590> and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
and sort of top to get to the top and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:36.890 
and sort of top to get to the top and
then<00:02:35.310> yeah<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.610> see<00:02:35.850> so<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.090> leads<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.630> the

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
then yeah you see so this leads to the

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.080 
then yeah you see so this leads to the
drill<00:02:37.560> which<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.830> powered<00:02:38.010> by<00:02:38.190> Hera<00:02:38.790> wine

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
drill which is powered by Hera wine

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.980 
drill which is powered by Hera wine
which<00:02:39.450> is<00:02:39.770> where<00:02:40.770> Sarah<00:02:41.070> brine<00:02:41.840> where<00:02:42.840> is

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
which is where Sarah brine where is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:46.490 
which is where Sarah brine where is
herobrine<00:02:43.970> start<00:02:44.970> right<00:02:45.120> up<00:02:45.150> here<00:02:45.420> at<00:02:46.320> the<00:02:46.350> top

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
herobrine start right up here at the top

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000 
herobrine start right up here at the top
of<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.860> creation<00:02:47.100> I<00:02:47.250> believe<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> top<00:02:49.860> of

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
of the creation I believe as the top of

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.310 
of the creation I believe as the top of
the<00:02:50.070> creation<00:02:50.310> like<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.940> vent<00:02:51.150> system<00:02:51.540> this

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:52.320 
the creation like the vent system this

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.400 
the creation like the vent system this
is<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.590> wheel<00:02:52.800> so<00:02:53.070> where's<00:02:53.250> Hera<00:02:53.490> brine

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.500 

there's<00:02:58.410> hair<00:02:58.650> run<00:02:58.830> okay<00:02:59.160> so<00:03:00.000> he<00:03:00.120> runs<00:03:00.300> over

there's hair run okay so he runs over
there<00:03:00.690> and<00:03:01.170> here's<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.100> wheel<00:03:02.310> would<00:03:02.580> sleep

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
there and here's the wheel would sleep

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.960 
there and here's the wheel would sleep
