these are the new si regulation Real

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.799 
these are the new si regulation Real
Steel<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.820> basically<00:01:02.820> makes<00:01:03.420> it<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.660> little

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
Steel which basically makes it a little

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.299 
Steel which basically makes it a little
bit<00:01:03.960> more<00:01:04.110> powerful<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.890> that's<00:01:04.979> what<00:01:05.189> these

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
bit more powerful and that's what these

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
bit more powerful and that's what these
are<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.729> even<00:01:05.939> as<00:01:06.780> good<00:01:06.960> as<00:01:07.110> these<00:01:07.290> were<00:01:07.470> but

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
are that even as good as these were but

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.539 
are that even as good as these were but
even<00:01:08.100> better

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
even better

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.320 
even better
we've<00:01:09.330> moved<00:01:09.510> up<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.810> level<00:01:10.100> from<00:01:11.150> 2017<00:01:12.150> all

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
we've moved up a level from 2017 all

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
we've moved up a level from 2017 all
fireworks<00:01:12.630> up<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.049> see<00:01:13.229> approved<00:01:13.590> these<00:01:13.799> are

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
fireworks up to see approved these are

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.789 
fireworks up to see approved these are
the<00:01:14.250> cheaper<00:01:14.670> ones<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.240> they're<00:01:15.630> amazing<00:01:16.110> um

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
the cheaper ones and they're amazing um

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.219 
the cheaper ones and they're amazing um
and<00:01:17.310> this<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:17.909> weird<00:01:18.119> thing<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.420> don't

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
and this is in the weird thing is don't

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.749 
and this is in the weird thing is don't
you<00:01:19.350> bring<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.590> kid<00:01:19.920> with<00:01:20.100> three<00:01:20.340> fires<00:01:20.729> in

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
you bring a kid with three fires in

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.310 
you bring a kid with three fires in
which<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.150> could<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.810> could<00:01:21.990> actually<00:01:22.110> buy

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
which you could you could actually buy

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.649 
which you could you could actually buy
this<00:01:22.380> kids<00:01:22.740> they<00:01:22.860> don't<00:01:23.009> like<00:01:23.250> that<00:01:23.430> one

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
this kids they don't like that one

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.960 
this kids they don't like that one
light<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> separate<00:01:25.680> but<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> ideas<00:01:26.640> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
light and separate but the ideas and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.390 
light and separate but the ideas and
this<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.299> principle<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:28.220> we've<00:01:29.220> got

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
this is the principle of is we've got

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
this is the principle of is we've got
five<00:01:29.640> fuses<00:01:30.090> so<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.420> connect<00:01:30.720> them

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
five fuses so we can connect them

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.020 
five fuses so we can connect them
together<00:01:31.110> so<00:01:31.740> ever<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.009> first<00:01:32.400> fuse<00:01:32.700> here

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
together so ever the first fuse here

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.270 
together so ever the first fuse here
again<00:01:33.840> there's<00:01:34.290> your<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.560> fuse<00:01:34.829> that<00:01:35.070> would

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
again there's your first fuse that would

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.730 
again there's your first fuse that would
not<00:01:35.490> would<00:01:35.549> be<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.759> Fugit<00:01:36.150> you're<00:01:36.329> just

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
not would be the Fugit you're just

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
not would be the Fugit you're just
exposing<00:01:37.740> your<00:01:38.070> like<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.310> fire<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.240> is

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
exposing your like the fire and this is

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.469 
exposing your like the fire and this is
the<00:01:39.450> stratum<00:01:39.930> of<00:01:39.990> our<00:01:40.170> second<00:01:40.560> fuels<00:01:41.479> which

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the stratum of our second fuels which

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.749 
the stratum of our second fuels which
comes<00:01:42.720> out<00:01:42.960> of<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.380> firework<00:01:43.860> which<00:01:44.520> goes

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
comes out of that firework which goes

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.609 
comes out of that firework which goes
into<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.119> fight<00:01:45.360> hood<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.840> as<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.409> can<00:01:46.560> see

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
into this fight hood so as you can see

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.469 
into this fight hood so as you can see
and<00:01:47.130> these<00:01:47.310> have<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> be<00:01:47.700> inserted

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and these have to be inserted

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.170 
and these have to be inserted
Pulliam<00:01:49.110> like<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.670> fall<00:01:50.670> into<00:01:50.820> that<00:01:50.939> allow

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
Pulliam like that fall into that allow

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
Pulliam like that fall into that allow
