00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
boot and stuff like that so we can see

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.569

we've<00:00:49.230> got<00:00:49.260> an<00:00:49.500> infection<00:00:49.770> on<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.309> want<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
we've got an infection on it I want to

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.450 
we've got an infection on it I want to
remove<00:00:50.910> this<00:00:51.149> on<00:00:52.050> reboot<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:53.070> we're<00:00:53.219> going<00:00:53.340> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
remove this on reboot so we're going to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.360 
remove this on reboot so we're going to
do<00:00:53.550> is<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> look<00:00:54.149> at<00:00:54.930> our<00:00:54.989> program<00:00:55.620> so<00:00:56.340> far

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
do is have a look at our program so far

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.459 
do is have a look at our program so far
governor's<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.090> portable<00:00:57.570> program<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
governor's a portable program that

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.830 
governor's a portable program that
allows<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.010> kill<00:00:59.940> this<00:01:00.090> process<00:01:00.660> and

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
allows you to kill this process and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.590 
allows you to kill this process and
delete<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.410> on<00:01:01.559> reboot<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.609> ideal<00:01:02.850> for

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
delete it on reboot which is ideal for

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.990 
delete it on reboot which is ideal for
malicious<00:01:04.080> files<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.430> these<00:01:05.610> roads

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
malicious files just like these roads

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.030 
malicious files just like these roads
and<00:01:06.270> stuff<00:01:06.479> so<00:01:07.080> let's<00:01:07.260> have<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.439> look<00:01:07.530> at<00:01:07.799> how<00:01:07.979> we

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
and stuff so let's have a look at how we

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
and stuff so let's have a look at how we
can<00:01:08.189> run<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.659> see<00:01:09.869> here<00:01:10.140> we've<00:01:10.320> got

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
can run this you can see here we've got

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.580 
can run this you can see here we've got
a<00:01:10.560> 32-bit<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.310> 64-bit<00:01:11.960> first<00:01:12.960> off<00:01:13.200> I'm<00:01:13.380> going

and drives also take the tick out of
high<00:01:21.390> distinction<00:01:22.549> now<00:01:23.549> once<00:01:23.790> we've<00:01:23.970> done

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
high distinction now once we've done

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.960 
high distinction now once we've done
that<00:01:24.210> I'm<00:01:24.750> going<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.229> try<00:01:25.439> to<00:01:25.470> click<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.100> file

governor<00:01:27.479> underscore<00:01:28.409> x<00:01:28.740> 86<00:01:29.310> that's<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
governor underscore x 86 that's the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.390 
governor underscore x 86 that's the
32-bit<00:01:30.360> version<00:01:30.750> now<00:01:31.530> sometimes<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> will

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
32-bit version now sometimes it will

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.609 
32-bit version now sometimes it will
stop<00:01:32.729> it<00:01:32.880> will<00:01:33.119> block<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.390> but<00:01:34.140> if<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.380> does

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
stop it will block it but if it does

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.429 
stop it will block it but if it does
then<00:01:35.280> you<00:01:35.520> need<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.820> rename<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:36.420> file<00:01:36.720> but

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
then you need to rename this file but

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.200 
then you need to rename this file but
first<00:01:37.740> off<00:01:37.920> this<00:01:38.070> try<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:38.850> we<00:01:38.970> can<00:01:39.090> get

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
first off this try and see if we can get

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.080 
first off this try and see if we can get
aware<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.659> where<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:39.900> can<00:01:40.229> that's<00:01:40.530> good<00:01:41.090> so

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
aware of it where we can that's good so

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.940 
aware of it where we can that's good so
now<00:01:42.240> we've<00:01:42.420> got<00:01:42.570> this<00:01:42.689> open<00:01:43.140> as<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.560> can<00:01:43.710> see

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
now we've got this open as you can see

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.859 
now we've got this open as you can see
here<00:01:44.280> it<00:01:44.399> gives<00:01:44.610> you<00:01:44.820> access<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.390> all<00:01:45.570> these

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
here it gives you access to all these

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.200 
here it gives you access to all these

system restore and so on so with that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.929 
system restore and so on so with that
said<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.560> can<00:01:52.979> actually<00:01:53.310> run<00:01:53.490> some<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:53.790> these

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
said we can actually run some of these

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.639 
said we can actually run some of these
here<00:01:54.270> we<00:01:54.509> can't<00:01:54.810> do<00:01:55.020> it<00:01:55.110> at<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.290> moment

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
here we can't do it at the moment

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.859 
here we can't do it at the moment
because<00:01:55.740> the<00:01:56.399> actual<00:01:56.700> program<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.420> blocking

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
because the actual program is blocking

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.469 
because the actual program is blocking
them<00:01:58.009> okay<00:01:59.009> as<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.640> see<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.149> it<00:02:00.240> shuts

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
them okay as you can see here it shuts

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
them okay as you can see here it shuts
them<00:02:00.600> down<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.439> what<00:02:01.619> we<00:02:01.770> can<00:02:02.040> do<00:02:02.280> is<00:02:02.640> use<00:02:03.149> the

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
them down but what we can do is use the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.050 
them down but what we can do is use the
actual<00:02:03.479> delete<00:02:04.469> facility<00:02:05.159> in<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> that's<00:02:05.790> got

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
actual delete facility in it that's got

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.150 
actual delete facility in it that's got
a<00:02:06.090> false<00:02:06.420> delete<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.439> it's<00:02:07.560> also<00:02:07.740> got<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
a false delete and it's also got a

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.609 
a false delete and it's also got a
reboot<00:02:08.700> delete<00:02:09.450> file<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:10.200> we're<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.500> do

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
reboot delete file so we're going to do

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680 
reboot delete file so we're going to do
that<00:02:10.830> or<00:02:11.009> you<00:02:11.039> can<00:02:11.280> rename<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.790> file<00:02:12.030> so<00:02:12.510> let's

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
that or you can rename the file so let's

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.550 
that or you can rename the file so let's
do<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.900> reboot

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
do a reboot

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.740 
do a reboot
delete<00:02:13.770> file<00:02:14.030> its<00:02:15.030> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.239> ask<00:02:15.420> for<00:02:15.660> the

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
delete file its going to ask for the

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.470 
delete file its going to ask for the
location<00:02:16.440> now<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:16.950> location<00:02:17.610> for<00:02:17.819> this<00:02:17.910> is<00:02:18.150> on

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
location now the location for this is on

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.970 
location now the location for this is on
this<00:02:18.660> icon<00:02:19.050> here<00:02:19.080> I<00:02:19.290> know<00:02:19.470> where<00:02:19.680> it<00:02:19.800> is

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
this icon here I know where it is

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.089 
this icon here I know where it is
they'll<00:02:20.849> go<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.030> properties<00:02:21.330> here<00:02:21.900> and<00:02:22.080> as<00:02:23.040> you

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
they'll go to properties here and as you

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.940 
they'll go to properties here and as you
can<00:02:23.340> see<00:02:23.370> we<00:02:23.730> know<00:02:23.940> it<00:02:24.090> is<00:02:24.270> in<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.500> program

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
can see we know it is in the program

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.000 
can see we know it is in the program
data<00:02:26.160> file<00:02:28.459> so<00:02:29.459> we<00:02:29.489> can<00:02:29.760> see<00:02:29.910> this<00:02:30.060> file<00:02:30.360> here

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
data file so we can see this file here

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.770 
data file so we can see this file here
what<00:02:32.010> we're<00:02:32.099> going<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.280> do<00:02:32.430> is<00:02:32.610> browse<00:02:35.720> go<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
what we're going to do is browse go to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.100 
what we're going to do is browse go to
the<00:02:37.769> c<00:02:38.010> drive<00:02:38.190> here<00:02:38.610> and<00:02:38.790> inside<00:02:39.599> here<00:02:39.930> there's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the c drive here and inside here there's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.780 
the c drive here and inside here there's
a<00:02:40.200> folder<00:02:40.470> now<00:02:40.769> that's<00:02:41.040> visible<00:02:41.370> called

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
a folder now that's visible called

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.400 
a folder now that's visible called
program<00:02:42.269> data<00:02:42.510> and<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.810> reason<00:02:43.140> why<00:02:43.260> it's

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
program data and the reason why it's

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.400 
program data and the reason why it's
hidden<00:02:44.300> visible<00:02:45.300> is<00:02:45.480> because<00:02:45.930> we're<00:02:46.110> shown

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
hidden visible is because we're shown

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.340 
hidden visible is because we're shown
that<00:02:47.160> folder<00:02:47.730> inside<00:02:48.390> search<00:02:48.690> options<00:02:49.170> okay

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
that folder inside search options okay

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.259 
that folder inside search options okay
so<00:02:49.530> we're<00:02:49.709> going<00:02:49.799> to<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:49.980> inside<00:02:50.310> here<00:02:50.730> and<00:02:50.880> it

00:02:51.259 --> 00:02:51.269 
so we're going to go inside here and it

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:54.229 
so we're going to go inside here and it
will<00:02:51.299> be<00:02:51.600> inside<00:02:52.170> here<00:02:52.739> need<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.489> go<00:02:53.760> in<00:02:53.910> here

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
will be inside here need to go in here

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.870 
will be inside here need to go in here
and<00:02:54.330> there<00:02:55.080> you<00:02:55.200> can<00:02:55.230> see<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.709> culprit<00:02:56.190> now

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
and there you can see the culprit now

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.180 
and there you can see the culprit now
the<00:02:57.450> reason<00:02:57.600> why<00:02:57.870> I've<00:02:57.989> showed<00:02:58.019> extensions<00:02:58.950> is

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
the reason why I've showed extensions is

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:02.300 
the reason why I've showed extensions is
so<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.730> see<00:02:59.940> the<00:03:00.090> dot<00:03:00.299> exe<00:03:00.510> file<00:03:01.310> extension

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
so I can see the dot exe file extension

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.789 
so I can see the dot exe file extension
and<00:03:02.430> that's<00:03:02.610> the<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.120> want<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.420> kill<00:03:03.799> so

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
and that's the one we want to kill so

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.940 
and that's the one we want to kill so
I'm<00:03:04.890> going<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.069> open<00:03:05.459> this<00:03:05.540> and<00:03:06.540> now<00:03:07.440> we've<00:03:07.709> got

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
I'm going to open this and now we've got

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.100 
I'm going to open this and now we've got
this<00:03:08.160> open<00:03:09.120> what<00:03:09.330> I'm<00:03:09.420> going<00:03:09.540> to<00:03:09.569> do<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.810> delete

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
this open what I'm going to do is delete

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.039 
this open what I'm going to do is delete
and<00:03:10.739> it<00:03:10.860> says<00:03:11.130> file<00:03:11.849> will<00:03:12.030> be<00:03:12.180> deleted<00:03:12.420> on<00:03:12.750> next

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
and it says file will be deleted on next

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.860 
and it says file will be deleted on next
reboot<00:03:13.380> so<00:03:14.010> let's<00:03:14.190> try<00:03:14.640> that<00:03:14.849> I'm<00:03:15.510> just<00:03:15.690> going

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
reboot so let's try that I'm just going

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.860 
reboot so let's try that I'm just going
to<00:03:15.930> quickly<00:03:16.170> reboot<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> system<00:03:17.099> and

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
to quickly reboot the system and

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:27.180 
to quickly reboot the system and
hopefully<00:03:18.870> that<00:03:19.019> will<00:03:19.079> be<00:03:19.140> the<00:03:19.350> end<00:03:19.380> up

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.790 

so<00:03:27.970> we<00:03:28.090> let<00:03:28.240> this<00:03:28.360> reboot<00:03:28.780> there<00:03:29.110> and<00:03:29.380> see<00:03:29.680> if

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
so we let this reboot there and see if

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:40.800 
so we let this reboot there and see if
we<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.100> there<00:03:30.310> remove<00:03:30.760> this<00:03:30.970> virus

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:40.810 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.610 

and<00:03:41.080> there<00:03:41.560> we<00:03:41.680> are<00:03:41.800> back<00:03:41.980> at<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.220> desktop<00:03:43.620> the

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:44.620 
and there we are back at the desktop the

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.500 
and there we are back at the desktop the
rogue<00:03:44.830> is<00:03:45.010> now<00:03:45.190> not<00:03:45.430> running<00:03:45.819> we<00:03:46.150> should<00:03:46.390> have

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
rogue is now not running we should have

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.990 
rogue is now not running we should have
full<00:03:46.750> access<00:03:46.780> to<00:03:47.140> our<00:03:47.560> system<00:03:48.099> as<00:03:48.430> you<00:03:48.670> can<00:03:48.790> see

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:49.000 
full access to our system as you can see

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.300 
full access to our system as you can see
here<00:03:49.270> and<00:03:51.180> now<00:03:52.180> what<00:03:52.420> I<00:03:52.450> would<00:03:52.569> do<00:03:52.870> is<00:03:53.140> run<00:03:53.620> my

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
here and now what I would do is run my

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.760 
here and now what I would do is run my
cleaning<00:03:54.580> program<00:03:55.270> I<00:03:55.530> malwarebytes<00:03:56.530> or

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:56.770 
cleaning program I malwarebytes or

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.979 
cleaning program I malwarebytes or
something<00:03:57.190> like<00:03:57.310> that<00:03:57.370> to<00:03:57.849> to<00:03:58.450> remove<00:03:58.810> the

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
something like that to to remove the

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.720 
something like that to to remove the
rest<00:03:59.230> of<00:03:59.410> the<00:03:59.530> remnants<00:03:59.950> that's<00:04:00.280> left<00:04:00.550> behind

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
rest of the remnants that's left behind

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.870 
rest of the remnants that's left behind
okay<00:04:01.800> let's<00:04:02.800> try<00:04:03.010> that<00:04:03.160> once<00:04:03.370> more<00:04:03.670> with

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:03.880 
okay let's try that once more with

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.510 
okay let's try that once more with
something<00:04:04.300> else

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.210 

infected<00:04:09.060> again<00:04:09.380> so<00:04:10.380> what<00:04:10.560> would<00:04:10.650> do<00:04:10.800> again<00:04:11.040> is

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
infected again so what would do again is

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.270 
infected again so what would do again is
we'll<00:04:11.430> try<00:04:11.700> our<00:04:12.170> program<00:04:13.170> once<00:04:13.410> more<00:04:13.680> I'm

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
we'll try our program once more I'm

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.910 
we'll try our program once more I'm
going<00:04:14.400> to<00:04:14.490> open<00:04:14.760> it<00:04:14.850> up<00:04:15.380> going<00:04:16.380> to<00:04:16.470> try<00:04:16.620> file

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
going to open it up going to try file

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
going to open it up going to try file
governor<00:04:17.750> again<00:04:22.010> okay<00:04:23.010> now<00:04:23.250> you<00:04:23.310> can<00:04:23.430> see<00:04:23.760> it's

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
governor again okay now you can see it's

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
something like that we're going to

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
running as you can see so we've got that

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.030 
running as you can see so we've got that
running<00:04:49.110> again<00:04:49.620> what<00:04:49.830> we<00:04:49.950> can<00:04:50.130> do<00:04:50.280> is<00:04:52.040> reboot

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.040 
running again what we can do is reboot

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.410 
running again what we can do is reboot
delete<00:04:53.370> file<00:04:55.250> browse<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.520> the<00:04:56.610> location<00:04:56.640> and

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
delete file browse to the location and

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:59.750 
delete file browse to the location and
there's<00:04:57.810> no<00:04:57.930> icon<00:04:58.470> here<00:04:58.890> so<00:04:59.220> you'd<00:04:59.400> have<00:04:59.610> to

00:04:59.750 --> 00:04:59.760 
there's no icon here so you'd have to

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.900 
there's no icon here so you'd have to
hunt<00:05:00.000> for<00:05:00.090> it<00:05:00.330> but<00:05:00.600> i'm<00:05:01.320> pretty<00:05:01.560> sure<00:05:01.910> you've

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
hunt for it but i'm pretty sure you've

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.190 
hunt for it but i'm pretty sure you've
been<00:05:03.030> watching<00:05:03.180> my<00:05:03.360> videos<00:05:03.390> for<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> while<00:05:03.930> you

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:04.200 
been watching my videos for a while you

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.780 
been watching my videos for a while you
you<00:05:04.500> can<00:05:04.710> sort<00:05:04.890> of<00:05:04.980> guess<00:05:05.190> where<00:05:05.430> they<00:05:05.580> are

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
you can sort of guess where they are

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.650 
you can sort of guess where they are
roughly<00:05:06.210> in<00:05:06.510> these<00:05:06.960> sort<00:05:07.200> of<00:05:07.260> areas<00:05:07.650> here<00:05:08.660> so

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
roughly in these sort of areas here so

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.010 
roughly in these sort of areas here so
we're<00:05:09.810> going<00:05:09.900> to<00:05:09.990> delete<00:05:10.200> this<00:05:10.440> file<00:05:10.800> and<00:05:12.020> then

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:13.020 
we're going to delete this file and then

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:16.520 
we're going to delete this file and then
delete<00:05:13.350> that<00:05:13.530> on<00:05:13.740> reboot<00:05:14.900> click<00:05:15.900> ok<00:05:16.320> and

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:35.760 

okay<00:05:27.020> we<00:05:27.140> let<00:05:27.290> this<00:05:27.410> boot<00:05:27.740> back<00:05:27.980> up
