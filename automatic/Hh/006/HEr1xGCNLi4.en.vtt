die-hard basketball fan if you're not
into<00:00:54.149> simulation<00:00:54.750> basketball<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:56.039> might

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
into simulation basketball this might

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.729 
into simulation basketball this might
not<00:00:56.430> be<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.699> video<00:00:57.180> for<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.710> are

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
again some great news now I figured out

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.670 
again some great news now I figured out
exactly<00:01:04.580> how<00:01:05.580> to<00:01:05.640> eliminate<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.659> lot<00:01:07.470> of<00:01:07.530> the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
exactly how to eliminate a lot of the

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.320 
exactly how to eliminate a lot of the
sliding<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.490> lot<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.570> motion<00:01:10.080> shifting<00:01:11.330> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
sliding a lot of the motion shifting the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.850 
sliding a lot of the motion shifting the
more<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> little<00:01:12.990> bit<00:01:13.080> of<00:01:13.229> morph<00:01:13.470> is<00:01:13.650> still

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
more a little bit of morph is still

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.490 
more a little bit of morph is still
there<00:01:14.130> because<00:01:14.310> that's<00:01:14.490> in<00:01:14.700> the<00:01:14.790> game<00:01:15.110> but<00:01:16.110> the

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
there because that's in the game but the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.039 
there because that's in the game but the
invisible<00:01:17.009> walls<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.490> stuff<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.049> virtually

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
invisible walls and stuff is virtually

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.270 
invisible walls and stuff is virtually
gone<00:01:19.670> gone<00:01:20.670> and<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.689> get<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.110> great<00:01:22.409> difficulty

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
gone gone and you get a great difficulty

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.030 
gone gone and you get a great difficulty
setting<00:01:24.210> now<00:01:24.840> again<00:01:25.170> I'm<00:01:25.439> going<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> lot

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:26.040 
setting now again I'm going to do a lot

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.620 
setting now again I'm going to do a lot
of<00:01:26.070> talking<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.729> lot<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> explaining

difficulty setting and you have the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.719 
difficulty setting and you have the
sliders<00:01:42.390> at<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.110> bottom<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:44.220> problem<00:01:44.610> what

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
sliders at the bottom the problem what

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.700

gameplay a great difficulty and you know
great<00:01:51.960> defense<00:01:52.409> and<00:01:52.560> stuff<00:01:52.770> by<00:01:53.130> using<00:01:53.399> both<00:01:54.270> of

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
great defense and stuff by using both of

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.459 
great defense and stuff by using both of
these<00:01:55.009> the<00:01:56.009> problem<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.670> you<00:01:56.939> can't<00:01:57.659> use<00:01:58.140> both

perfectly weeks or not the further you

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.630 
perfectly weeks or not the further you
turn<00:04:16.320> it<00:04:16.440> down<00:04:16.560> obviously<00:04:17.100> is<00:04:17.220> going<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.489> be

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
turn it down obviously is going to be

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.510 
turn it down obviously is going to be
more<00:04:18.299> difficult<00:04:18.630> for<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.260> so<00:04:19.830> don't<00:04:20.040> consider

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:20.520 
more difficult for you so don't consider

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.940 
more difficult for you so don't consider

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
does this mean is that the computer is

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.700 
does this mean is that the computer is

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:13.030 
do that's why it appears very easy to

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.490 
do that's why it appears very easy to
defeat<00:05:14.030> the<00:05:14.180> computer<00:05:14.600> is<00:05:14.930> because<00:05:15.230> these<00:05:15.350> are

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:15.500 
defeat the computer is because these are

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.840 
defeat the computer is because these are
on<00:05:15.620> 50<00:05:16.010> and<00:05:16.190> they're<00:05:16.310> just<00:05:16.430> standing<00:05:16.670> there

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.130 
they don't know what to do because you

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:21.250 
they don't know what to do because you
know<00:05:19.250> they're<00:05:19.430> 50<00:05:19.730> 50<00:05:20.090> tourneys<00:05:20.660> up<00:05:20.870> which

to do it immediately i'm going to show

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.490 
to do it immediately i'm going to show
you<00:05:27.200> examples<00:05:27.890> again<00:05:28.120> these<00:05:29.120> you<00:05:29.420> want<00:05:29.600> a<00:05:29.690> 75

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
you examples again these you want a 75

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.560 
you examples again these you want a 75
you<00:05:30.920> want<00:05:31.100> the<00:05:31.190> computer<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.760> shoot<00:05:32.240> a<00:05:32.270> better

you want the computer to shoot a better

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.110 
you want the computer to shoot a better
percentage<00:05:33.020> than<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.500> again<00:05:34.190> because<00:05:34.790> the
