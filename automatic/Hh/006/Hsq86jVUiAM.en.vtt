bright<00:03:52.250> colors<00:03:52.580> when<00:03:53.239> first<00:03:53.540> I<00:03:53.750> saw<00:03:53.989> this

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
bright colors when first I saw this

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.550 
bright colors when first I saw this
palette<00:03:54.560> I<00:03:54.680> thought<00:03:54.890> this<00:03:55.070> was<00:03:55.370> actually<00:03:55.670> the

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
palette I thought this was actually the

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.050 
palette I thought this was actually the
Curacao<00:03:57.560> palette<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:58.190> they<00:03:58.580> had<00:03:58.700> just<00:03:58.910> kind

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
Curacao palette and they had just kind

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.960 
Curacao palette and they had just kind
of<00:03:59.150> renamed<00:03:59.570> it<00:03:59.750> but<00:04:00.050> no<00:04:00.350> this<00:04:00.650> is<00:04:00.830> not<00:04:01.100> at<00:04:01.760> all

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
of renamed it but no this is not at all

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:03.610 
of renamed it but no this is not at all
I<00:04:02.090> think<00:04:02.239> your<00:04:02.570> separate<00:04:03.050> the<00:04:03.140> colors<00:04:03.320> are

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:03.620 
I think your separate the colors are

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.890 
I think your separate the colors are
bright<00:04:03.830> like<00:04:04.190> the<00:04:04.610> one<00:04:04.790> in<00:04:05.060> purest<00:04:05.540> like<00:04:05.750> the

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
bright like the one in purest like the

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.840 
bright like the one in purest like the
ones<00:04:06.050> in<00:04:06.140> the<00:04:06.230> Curacao<00:04:06.650> color<00:04:06.920> but<00:04:07.520> this<00:04:07.670> is

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
ones in the Curacao color but this is

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:09.220 
ones in the Curacao color but this is
the<00:04:08.060> completely<00:04:08.420> different<00:04:08.480> palette<00:04:09.050> and
