00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
for everyone even though I probably

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:20.210 
for everyone even though I probably
could<00:04:17.850> and<00:04:18.150> get<00:04:18.239> rid<00:04:18.419> of<00:04:18.450> things<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:19.709> you'll

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
could and get rid of things now you'll

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:21.620 
could and get rid of things now you'll
see<00:04:20.310> here<00:04:20.820> that<00:04:20.850> we<00:04:21.150> had<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.359> get<00:04:21.479> rid<00:04:21.570> of

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
see here that we had to get rid of

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.899 
see here that we had to get rid of
Marvin<00:04:21.840> Williams<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.560> in<00:04:23.250> our<00:04:23.400> starting

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
Marvin Williams and in our starting

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:25.909 
Marvin Williams and in our starting
lineup<00:04:23.940> he<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.510> actually<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.289> power<00:04:25.500> forward

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
lineup he is actually the power forward

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.740 
lineup he is actually the power forward
and<00:04:26.250> Derrick<00:04:26.970> Favors<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.450> a<00:04:27.479> sin

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
and Derrick Favors is a sin

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.770 
and Derrick Favors is a sin
Center<00:04:28.820> so<00:04:29.820> it's<00:04:30.270> interesting<00:04:31.200> we<00:04:32.070> can<00:04:32.220> move

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
Center so it's interesting we can move

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:35.210 
Center so it's interesting we can move
Derrick<00:04:33.780> Favors<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.290> power<00:04:34.530> forward<00:04:34.860> and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
Derrick Favors to the power forward and

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:40.010
