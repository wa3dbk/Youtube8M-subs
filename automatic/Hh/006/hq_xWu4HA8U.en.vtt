00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:09.769
 today we will see the recipe for 

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:11.509
 fruit tart 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.820
 it would not be a pie recipe 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.450
 classic made with a sweet dough or 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.250
 sanded but a pie made with a 

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:20.180
 sponge cake that we are going to cook in 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.060
 pie molds 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.529
 so I start to prepare the sponge cake 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.779
 I'm going yellow bins 2 the sugar and the 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:36.739
 vanilla until I have a mixture 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:38.390
 clear and light station now he 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:42.250
 will have to add the sifted flour with 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:42.250
 yeast and mix well 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.750
 add a pinch of salt to the whites 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.750
 before putting them in the snow 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:10.590
 incorporate the white age at the dough into 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.510
 taking care not to break them 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.790
 at the beginning you put a little bit of 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.440
 relax the dough and then add the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.440
 remains by gently incorporating 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.049
 in the end you get a paw 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:43.710
 frothy and light that we will pour into 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.710
 pie molds 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.060
 cook in a preheated oven 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.330
 180 Â° for 15 to 20 minutes 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.550
 we 'll let it cool a bit before 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.050
 to unmold them loved put the bottom of 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.100
 pie on a rack to let them 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.350
 cool completely 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.450
 so we can use them right away 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.480
 so we will garnish them with a cream and 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.610
 the fluids as we can leave them at 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.610
 fresh enough to put them in a 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.130
 box or in a plastic bag the 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.200
 leave in the fridge until the next day at 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.590
 even holidays until the day we have them 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.530
 need 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.709
 so we'll go to the preparation of the 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.240
 cream it would be a pastry cream I 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:34.340
 me milk to boil in a saucepan 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.070
 with a vanilla pod and half 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.010
 sugar in a game container but the 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:42.200
 2 egg yolks with the rest of the sugar 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.380
 and I mix Julian to make them 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.380
 whitewash 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:58.530
 now the game is the starch of 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:00.000
 corn or flour and mixed with it 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.129
 newspaper mix plays very ugly one has 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.129
 boil with the sugar and the 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.069
 vanilla then we'll put everything back into 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.689
 the pan on the fire 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:15.750
 without stopping stirring until you 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:17.459
 to have a thick cream was this 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.049
 cream in a container where you 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.989
 cover with a food film at 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.239
 contact to prevent the couple from 

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:26.599
 shape we'll leave it cool for 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.829
 well cool forward in use 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.530
 now I'm going to soak up the funds from 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:33.450
 pie who have full we believe said with a 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.010
 Strawberry syrup is simply 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.799
 strawberry jam you 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.480

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.510
 will soon have a baby for it to be 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.849
 not is that the tasting cream 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.409
 well cooled becomes harder it will take 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:48.930
 the forest you are a little to make it 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.060
 more anxious before putting it in 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:53.609
 a pocket to be able to garnish funds 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.919
 pie with one can also use a 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:58.319
 spoon for the filling if we do not have 

00:03:55.919 --> 00:04:00.150
 pocket we still have that she has 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.500
 she is fuzzy on top not to forget 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.019
