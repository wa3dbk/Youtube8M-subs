here<00:01:25.789> if<00:01:25.909> I<00:01:26.060> just<00:01:26.240> pull<00:01:26.420> up<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:26.749> them<00:01:26.899> they

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
here if I just pull up on them they

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.349 
here if I just pull up on them they
easily<00:01:27.829> unlatch<00:01:28.340> and<00:01:28.670> that<00:01:28.909> takes<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.209> side

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
easily unlatch and that takes the side

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:30.760 
easily unlatch and that takes the side
panel<00:01:29.659> off<00:01:29.780> when<00:01:30.109> I'm<00:01:30.200> ready<00:01:30.380> to<00:01:30.469> put<00:01:30.590> it<00:01:30.679> back

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:30.770 
panel off when I'm ready to put it back

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.249 
panel off when I'm ready to put it back
on<00:01:30.799> I<00:01:31.189> just<00:01:31.639> push<00:01:31.819> it<00:01:31.850> closed<00:01:32.209> latch<00:01:33.020> down

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
on I just push it closed latch down

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.349 
on I just push it closed latch down
latch<00:01:33.979> down<00:01:34.219> that's<00:01:34.670> going<00:01:34.819> to<00:01:34.909> hold<00:01:34.999> it<00:01:35.149> nice

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
latch down that's going to hold it nice

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:36.669 
latch down that's going to hold it nice
and<00:01:35.569> securely<00:01:35.869> it's<00:01:36.139> not<00:01:36.319> going<00:01:36.529> anywhere

00:01:36.669 --> 00:01:36.679 
and securely it's not going anywhere

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:38.980 
and securely it's not going anywhere
it's<00:01:37.429> very<00:01:37.639> easy<00:01:37.819> to<00:01:38.029> get<00:01:38.119> in<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:38.509> these<00:01:38.840> have

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
it's very easy to get in and these have

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.330 
it's very easy to get in and these have
a<00:01:39.049> really<00:01:39.350> cool<00:01:39.560> aesthetic<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.189> don't

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
a really cool aesthetic that you don't

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.010 
a really cool aesthetic that you don't
see<00:01:40.459> in<00:01:40.490> a<00:01:40.579> lot<00:01:40.639> of<00:01:40.759> cases<00:01:41.029> so<00:01:41.749> let<00:01:41.840> me<00:01:41.899> go<00:01:41.990> ahead

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
see in a lot of cases so let me go ahead

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:43.179 
see in a lot of cases so let me go ahead
and<00:01:42.170> pop<00:01:42.350> this<00:01:42.380> off<00:01:42.649> and<00:01:42.889> I'll<00:01:42.979> show<00:01:43.159> you

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
and pop this off and I'll show you

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.910 
and pop this off and I'll show you
inside<00:01:43.520> of<00:01:43.639> the<00:01:43.700> computer

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.169 

so<00:01:50.920> once<00:01:51.070> we<00:01:51.159> have<00:01:51.250> the<00:01:51.340> side<00:01:51.490> panel<00:01:51.789> off<00:01:51.909> you

00:01:52.169 --> 00:01:52.179 
so once we have the side panel off you

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:53.849 
so once we have the side panel off you
can<00:01:52.299> see<00:01:52.450> that<00:01:52.479> our<00:01:52.719> OD<00:01:53.049> green<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.560> black

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
can see that our OD green and black

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:55.169 
can see that our OD green and black
finish<00:01:54.250> has<00:01:54.460> contained<00:01:54.759> it<00:01:54.850> on<00:01:54.939> the<00:01:55.030> inside

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179 
finish has contained it on the inside

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:57.240 
finish has contained it on the inside
this<00:01:55.929> is<00:01:56.109> nice<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.560> always<00:01:56.829> find<00:01:56.950> it<00:01:57.070> kind<00:01:57.219> of

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
this is nice I always find it kind of

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.679 
this is nice I always find it kind of
disappointing<00:01:57.759> if<00:01:57.820> I<00:01:57.880> take<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> side<00:01:58.270> panel<00:01:58.479> off

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
disappointing if I take a side panel off

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.149 
disappointing if I take a side panel off
especially<00:01:58.960> on<00:01:59.289> a<00:01:59.320> theme<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.560> chassis<00:02:00.009> like

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
especially on a theme to chassis like

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:02.219 
especially on a theme to chassis like
this<00:02:00.340> and<00:02:00.549> I<00:02:01.149> met<00:02:01.360> with<00:02:01.509> a<00:02:01.539> sea<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.810> bland

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
this and I met with a sea of bland

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.139 
this and I met with a sea of bland
unpainted<00:02:02.740> metal<00:02:02.920> that<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:03.700> kind<00:02:03.819> of<00:02:03.880> ruins

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
unpainted metal that just kind of ruins

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.029 
unpainted metal that just kind of ruins
it<00:02:04.270> for<00:02:04.299> me<00:02:04.450> so<00:02:04.719> for<00:02:04.929> this<00:02:05.049> you<00:02:05.530> have<00:02:05.649> this<00:02:05.740> nice

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
it for me so for this you have this nice

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.649 
it for me so for this you have this nice

theming all throughout the entire

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:09.330 
theming all throughout the entire
computer<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.560> while<00:02:08.679> we're<00:02:08.799> inside<00:02:08.979> the

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:09.340 
computer so while we're inside the

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.979 
computer so while we're inside the
system<00:02:09.640> I'd<00:02:09.879> like<00:02:10.090> to<00:02:10.119> show<00:02:10.360> you<00:02:10.450> the<00:02:10.599> airflow

that's<00:02:38.709> going<00:02:38.860> to<00:02:38.920> make<00:02:39.010> upgrading<00:02:39.549> or<00:02:39.700> adding

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
that's going to make upgrading or adding

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.120 
that's going to make upgrading or adding
new<00:02:40.060> storage<00:02:40.360> very<00:02:40.959> easy<00:02:41.200> these<00:02:41.860> are<00:02:42.010> also

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
new storage very easy these are also

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.430 
new storage very easy these are also
very<00:02:42.430> easy<00:02:42.489> to<00:02:42.790> take<00:02:43.000> out<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.900> put<00:02:44.079> back<00:02:44.230> in

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.289 
now but there's still a great feature
because<00:02:54.519> they're<00:02:54.730> going<00:02:54.819> to<00:02:54.910> make<00:02:55.000> sure<00:02:55.120> your

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
because they're going to make sure your

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:56.729 
because they're going to make sure your
airflow<00:02:55.660> is<00:02:55.959> clean<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.440> unobstructed

airflow is clean and unobstructed

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.379 
airflow is clean and unobstructed
they're<00:02:57.609> also<00:02:57.730> going<00:02:57.910> to<00:02:57.970> make<00:02:58.090> the<00:02:58.180> computer

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389 
they're also going to make the computer

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.360 
they're also going to make the computer
look<00:02:58.690> more<00:02:58.840> visually<00:02:59.230> appealing<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.769> make<00:03:00.220> it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
look more visually appealing and make it

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.309 
look more visually appealing and make it
easier<00:03:00.639> to<00:03:00.700> upgrade<00:03:00.880> his<00:03:01.120> time<00:03:01.329> goes<00:03:01.540> on<00:03:01.660> now

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
easier to upgrade his time goes on now

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.110 
easier to upgrade his time goes on now
speaking<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.709> upgradability<00:03:03.489> that's<00:03:03.910> one
