00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
planning on using him but I guess I

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.110 
planning on using him but I guess I
didn't<00:02:52.770> know<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.100> do<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.310> him<00:02:53.520> or<00:02:53.850> it

strong<00:03:33.000> like<00:03:33.150> I<00:03:33.240> said<00:03:33.390> before<00:03:33.510> he<00:03:33.810> kept<00:03:34.050> two

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
strong like I said before he kept two

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.660 
strong like I said before he kept two
earths<00:03:34.500> from<00:03:34.890> colliding<00:03:35.280> with<00:03:35.370> each<00:03:35.490> other

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
earths from colliding with each other

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.660 
earths from colliding with each other
which<00:03:36.540> arguably<00:03:37.500> takes<00:03:37.770> a<00:03:37.920> lot<00:03:38.190> of<00:03:38.220> strength

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
which arguably takes a lot of strength

now<00:03:39.620> with<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.740> being<00:03:40.920> said<00:03:41.070> also<00:03:41.790> as<00:03:42.180> you<00:03:42.330> can

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
now with that being said also as you can

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.790 
now with that being said also as you can
see<00:03:42.510> in<00:03:42.570> left<00:03:42.780> panel<00:03:42.990> that's<00:03:43.230> him<00:03:43.410> punching

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:43.800 
see in left panel that's him punching

a<00:03:55.350> little<00:03:55.770> you<00:03:56.130> know<00:03:56.190> keep<00:03:56.460> in<00:03:56.610> thought<00:03:56.850> that's

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
a little you know keep in thought that's

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.950 
a little you know keep in thought that's
very<00:03:57.960> very<00:03:58.080> strong<00:03:58.530> obviously<00:03:59.330> now<00:04:00.330> speed<00:04:00.840> is

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:00.960 
very very strong obviously now speed is

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.350 
very very strong obviously now speed is
very<00:04:01.110> fast<00:04:01.230> he's<00:04:01.740> been<00:04:02.640> claimed<00:04:02.880> to<00:04:02.910> possibly

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
very fast he's been claimed to possibly

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.720 
very fast he's been claimed to possibly
be<00:04:03.540> faster<00:04:03.990> and<00:04:04.080> light<00:04:04.320> um<00:04:04.590> it's<00:04:05.430> know<00:04:05.580> he's

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
be faster and light um it's know he's

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:08.000 
be faster and light um it's know he's
faster<00:04:06.120> than<00:04:06.240> lightning<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.870> other<00:04:07.680> very

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
faster than lightning and other very

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.410 
faster than lightning and other very
quick<00:04:08.460> things<00:04:08.760> such<00:04:09.300> as<00:04:09.420> that<00:04:09.740> durability

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
quick things such as that durability

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.350 
quick things such as that durability
he's<00:04:12.420> pretty<00:04:12.840> much<00:04:13.370> indestructible<00:04:14.370> in<00:04:14.880> terms

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:15.360 
he's pretty much indestructible in terms

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.530 
he's pretty much indestructible in terms
of<00:04:15.859> anything<00:04:16.859> killing<00:04:17.459> him<00:04:17.609> I<00:04:17.820> think<00:04:18.359> that's

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:18.540 
of anything killing him I think that's

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:20.000 
of anything killing him I think that's
pretty<00:04:18.780> obvious<00:04:19.260> from<00:04:19.380> anything<00:04:19.650> about<00:04:19.859> the

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
pretty obvious from anything about the

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.240 
pretty obvious from anything about the
fact<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.400> he<00:04:21.120> survived<00:04:21.590> two<00:04:22.590> universes

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
fact that he survived two universes

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.430 
fact that he survived two universes
colliding<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
colliding and

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.890 
colliding and
destruction<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.040> both<00:04:25.190> universes<00:04:25.820> he<00:04:26.720> was<00:04:26.810> the

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
destruction of both universes he was the

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.660 
destruction of both universes he was the
only<00:04:27.020> thing<00:04:27.140> in<00:04:27.470> either<00:04:27.800> university<00:04:28.370> survived

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:28.670 
only thing in either university survived

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:31.240 
only thing in either university survived
that<00:04:28.880> so<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.210> pretty<00:04:29.240> impressive<00:04:30.250> healing

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
that so it's pretty impressive healing

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.220 
that so it's pretty impressive healing
senses<00:04:31.670> you<00:04:31.880> know<00:04:31.910> telescopic<00:04:32.660> vision<00:04:32.810> things

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
senses you know telescopic vision things

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.800 
senses you know telescopic vision things
such<00:04:33.410> as<00:04:33.440> that<00:04:33.560> hearing<00:04:34.460> all<00:04:35.090> that<00:04:35.150> stuff<00:04:35.570> a

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
such as that hearing all that stuff a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:38.260 
such as that hearing all that stuff a
flight<00:04:36.530> he<00:04:36.740> could<00:04:36.890> fly<00:04:37.100> at<00:04:37.400> unknown<00:04:37.940> speeds

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.270 
flight he could fly at unknown speeds

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.840 
flight he could fly at unknown speeds
stamina<00:04:39.050> atomic<00:04:39.980> fission<00:04:40.130> I<00:04:40.400> think<00:04:40.520> it<00:04:40.610> Tomic

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:40.850 
stamina atomic fission I think it Tomic

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:42.550 
stamina atomic fission I think it Tomic
visions<00:04:41.180> kind<00:04:41.360> of<00:04:41.450> self-explanatory

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
visions kind of self-explanatory

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.890 
visions kind of self-explanatory
it's<00:04:43.190> basically<00:04:43.550> heat<00:04:43.700> vision<00:04:44.030> but<00:04:44.570> he<00:04:44.780> could

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
it's basically heat vision but he could

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.320 
it's basically heat vision but he could
focus<00:04:45.050> it<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.560> you<00:04:46.460> know<00:04:46.580> two<00:04:46.640> different

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
focus it and you know two different

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
focus it and you know two different
different<00:04:48.080> degrees<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:49.040> all<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.700> stuff<00:04:50.000> so

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
different degrees and all that stuff so

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:52.540 
different degrees and all that stuff so
that's<00:04:51.350> really<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.650> for<00:04:51.740> this<00:04:51.830> character<00:04:52.130> um

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:52.550
