00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.540
 you heard 

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.399
 it in 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:12.339
 it is a shame 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:13.389
 the special year 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:15.229
 this arose 

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:18.070
 61 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:19.060
 it's very simple 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.220
 according to but this year is not through 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 christian eriksen 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.380
 only the facade i have done 

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.970
 it won't go off then 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.780
 the vvd but not everyone still considering an offer 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.510
 what is striking is all I can do now and why do you think you are speaking 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.170
 not posted 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.559
 9 but what I did just woke up completely smeared with desires like 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.020
 someone the truth discovers the board surely from school 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.030
 and sent from school like that 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.140
 when I see what if someone is less likely to start searching 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.690
 please just don't do it that way 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:09.980
 he was different than to grow at what I would never do, I will contact him 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.190
 with the doctor 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.590
 take a moment to catch up I'll see you later 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.630
 I got it yesterday 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:31.000
 isn't going to get Haarlem anything that was very sad how settled on the 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 back of the school 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.400
 all that 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.080
 but why should they be sure i have very sensitive subject 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.950
 I can't believe he did it from the industry 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.670
 I'm still not familiar with you 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.610
 we have to talk about hold i know he has the school beaten if you 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.810
 suspend innocence from the newspaper's pole 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 I had given a big order to shorten an hour of playing 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.870
 but he is not up 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:02.270
 I asked for it and apparently no longer could his music be turned off 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.750
 all of them 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.260
 this tunes jackson and if you don't mind I would like his work done 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:12.019
 sit now 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:12.079
 I
