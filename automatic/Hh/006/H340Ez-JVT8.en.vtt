00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:09.240
 iomega simons at jo find themselves for 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.650
 a tutorial on the strip stone so in 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.280
 this cheater 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.279
 we are going to combine cola clegg and 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.990
 normal stoll leader then the difference 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.020
 of the two is that for the neck has claim 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.510
 you have to climb to the side of the ladder 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 and with an end echoing the klein 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.289
 we fall back all the time on the failure 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:32.669
 canton until things are 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:35.430
 so obvious end for a normal leader 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:41.879
 down already we have in front then it's just 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.410
 bounce again a facebook is it 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:48.870
 often the simplest I do but 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:52.260
 well that's how it is then so in colas 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.960
 cries I show you what it is 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.539
 big it already consists mounted on the side 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.090
 of scale then when you're there 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.420
 you point your right joystick 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.010
 that is to say the one for the view towards the 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.880
 side of mine that is the wall 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:11.430
 and your scale drug here the list 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.320
 so the diu stick right we will point 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.409
 deep right so I know this plh 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:19.890
 little more plus and once that is 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.860
 do you're going to jump while keeping 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.240
 your joystick like that and doing that 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.350
 you have everything to catch up with you 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.390
 like these do not see there and so then 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.000
 how to combine with a leader 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.469
 store i will show what it looks like 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.990
 so that gives that 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:41.390
 alas right there I stop at two 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.539
 twists we do not care you can 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.759
 do more or less so there after when 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.850
 you want to go back to leader stoll 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:52.939
 normal what will have to do is 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.709
 it's instead of keeping your joystick 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.959
 caffe arm or to the right 

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:59.689
 you're going to leave it normal in 

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:01.939
 looking at the wall you look at the wall and 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:04.130
 jump like that by moving you a 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:07.579
 just a little bit to the left with your 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.420
 joystick left that is to say that there 

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:14.209
 we make colette lime and there hop on 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:17.569
 stop pointing a joystick and get 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.430
 head a little bit towards the 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.379
 left end towards the side of the ladder 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.019
 to be able to bounce in leader stone 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.879
 normal here after we can not hurt 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.519
 of variants and we just show it 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:29.810
 how does it make the video lafa you 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.750
 will have some small sequences 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.400
 private so there this time it's safe and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.349
 certain since I already have them on my 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.609
 pc and everything because last time 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.099
 it's true that I did not have time to 

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:42.349
 where and where would you say to have and 

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.910
 by brand so there you have it 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:47.000
 normally an aura two or three I 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.590
 believe so here I am I say hi 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.590
 guys and see you next time 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.310
 look for excuses
