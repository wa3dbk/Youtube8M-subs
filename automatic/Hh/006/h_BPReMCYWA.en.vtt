00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
accidentally hit a d instead of an F

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.280 
accidentally hit a d instead of an F
because<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.550> from<00:00:35.670> Japan<00:00:36.149> they<00:00:36.809> didn't<00:00:37.079> know

the English album that makes a lot of

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.299 
the English album that makes a lot of
food<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.719> they<00:00:39.930> were<00:00:40.050> probably<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:41.010> I

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
food so they were probably just like I

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.000
