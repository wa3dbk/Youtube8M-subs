00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 hello youtube friends we are again 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.330
 with the friend watch fields and in this 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:08.309
 new tutorial let's learn how to 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.980
 activate all commercial versions 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.650
 of microsoft office 2013 in my case I'm going 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 to activate the professional plus good 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.760
 before starting so that this and 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.619
 any activator of office 2013 them 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.529
 work have to have installed the 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.600
 net framework 4 full or superior which 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.939
 I'll leave the link in the description of 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.740
 video is downloaded and installed before 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.650
 to start this good tutorial 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.480
 let's start the first thing that I will do is 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.780
 show them that I do not have activated the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.780
 office 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.059
 well there are several ways to activate it 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.059
 clear online if you want to pay for it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.060
 by ignoring the activation box the 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.189
 from Microsoft this time they were a 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.290
 complete trash with us because 

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:22.360
 when the trial period expires 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.360
 you can not do anything 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:31.179
 Now good start with 

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:32.979
 tutorial the first thing we should do 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.820
 is to go to the link of the description 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.520
 of the video and download the rar file 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.200
 already when the following has been downloaded 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.680
 What we have to do is to extract the 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.680
 archive 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.110
 we opened the folder that was extracted and 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.610
 also those that are inside that 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:03.610
 until you get to the executable file 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.729
 and we execute it as administrator for 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.060
 that we do not find problems during the 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.060
 activation 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.510
 it will start to extract automatically 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.900
 until the interface of the 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.900
 activator 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.200
 First I will explain how 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.090
 activate it in windows 8 already in the console 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.670
 of activation we are shown a series 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.100
 of options we must choose 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.860
 the second option by pressing the s key 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:36.690
 and then we press enter and wait 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.380
 a few seconds for a 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.380
 new window 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:45.020
 the new window shows us a series 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:49.250
 of options to validate windows 7 and 8 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:53.180
 office 2010 and 2013 until server 2008 and 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:55.070
 2012 we return to the office tab and 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.160
 we press the button actÃ­vate office 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:59.870
 2013 we waited a few seconds and we were ready 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.560
 will give another window that will tell us that 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:05.360
 our office is activated correctly 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.430
 this method that we just saw works 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.800
 in windows 7 and in 8 but sometimes 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.600
 tends to fail in windows 7 for certain 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.910
 reasons why I will show you how 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.290
 activate it if you get error in windows 7 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.290
 this first procedure 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.300
 we run again as administrator 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.130
 the file that we unzip and when 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.660
 we see the activation console 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.980
 we select the first option 

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.980
 pressing the key 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.660
 when we have already selected the first 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.240
 option by pressing the key we give enter 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.630
 and we let the program do everything for 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.630
 If only 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:57.590
 to check that everything is working 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.300
 correctly I went to the administrator 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.850
 tasks and there I realized that there are several 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.430
 processes with the name of kms good 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:06.500
 now we only have to wait from 15 to 25 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.390
 minutes let the program do its 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.170
 work and better say a relax in 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:11.170
 facebook or on twitter 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.769
 when enough time has passed 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:18.199
 open any office product and 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.199
 you will see that the office has been activated 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.199
 correctly 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.250
 All menus are activated 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.119
 the next thing we should do to 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.979
 know if it's really activated is from 

00:04:51.119 --> 00:04:55.259
 go to the file menu and there 

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:57.240
 we select the option account and there it is 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.759
 where he will show us all the information 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.229
 of our product good kind people 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.240
 I think this has been all 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.430
 remember try the first option is 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.589
 the easiest but if that gives them error 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.319
 must resort to the second option is 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:12.180
 the safest one is not going to fail them and 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:13.889
 also everything they will need is 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:16.259
 I leave you in the description of the video 

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.959
