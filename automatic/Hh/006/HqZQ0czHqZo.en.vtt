slicing<00:01:07.350> a<00:01:07.409> cucumber<00:01:07.680> doesn't<00:01:08.040> seem<00:01:08.159> very

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
slicing a cucumber doesn't seem very

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.800 
slicing a cucumber doesn't seem very
high-tech<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.880> it's<00:01:09.060> really<00:01:09.390> not<00:01:09.570> but

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
high-tech and it's really not but

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.570 
high-tech and it's really not but
there's<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.439> few<00:01:10.680> different<00:01:11.010> ways<00:01:11.159> that<00:01:11.430> you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
can do this and it really affects the

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.899 
can do this and it really affects the
flavor<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.380> the<00:01:13.470> salad<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.280> way<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.700> do<00:01:14.760> it

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
flavor of the salad the way that I do it

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.840 
flavor of the salad the way that I do it
most<00:01:15.299> of<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.600> time<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:16.380> very<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:17.280> very<00:01:17.549> very

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
most of the time is very very very very

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.570 
most of the time is very very very very
very<00:01:17.970> paper-thin<00:01:20.600> slices<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.020> cucumber

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
very paper-thin slices of the cucumber

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.219 
very paper-thin slices of the cucumber
these<00:01:23.580> absorb<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.659> bit<00:01:24.750> more<00:01:24.930> gives<00:01:25.140> you

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
these absorb a little bit more gives you

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.109 
these absorb a little bit more gives you
more<00:01:25.380> surface<00:01:25.890> area<00:01:26.070> I<00:01:26.490> hope<00:01:26.700> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:26.970> see

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
more surface area I hope you can see

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.480 
more surface area I hope you can see
that<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.630> but<00:01:28.470> they<00:01:28.560> are<00:01:28.680> very<00:01:28.829> very<00:01:29.130> thin

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
that and but they are very very thin

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.630 
that and but they are very very thin
that's<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.540> way<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.780> do<00:01:31.049> it<00:01:31.170> and<00:01:31.530> it<00:01:32.310> creates

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
that's one way to do it and it creates

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.300 
that's one way to do it and it creates
one<00:01:32.909> type<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.210> flavor

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
one type of flavor

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.950 
one type of flavor
another<00:01:35.310> way<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.840> bit

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
another way to do it is a little bit

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.230 
another way to do it is a little bit
thicker<00:01:37.259> now<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.979> gives<00:01:38.189> more<00:01:38.670> cucumber

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
thicker now this gives more cucumber

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.940 
thicker now this gives more cucumber
taste<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.960> more<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.380> these<00:01:40.619> something

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
taste and it's more like these something

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.620 
taste and it's more like these something
on<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.369> cucumber<00:01:41.850> rather<00:01:42.180> than<00:01:42.509> an

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
on the cucumber rather than an

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.620 
on the cucumber rather than an
integrated<00:01:43.229> flavor<00:01:43.640> the<00:01:44.640> next<00:01:44.880> way<00:01:45.060> to<00:01:45.090> do<00:01:45.390> it

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
integrated flavor the next way to do it

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.410 
integrated flavor the next way to do it
and<00:01:45.990> it's<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.320> little<00:01:46.530> bit<00:01:46.740> more<00:01:47.180> little<00:01:48.180> easier

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
and it's a little bit more little easier

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.280 
and it's a little bit more little easier
to<00:01:48.509> eat<00:01:48.659> with<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> fork<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.130> chunk<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:51.290> like

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
to eat with a fork is to chunk it like

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.840 
to eat with a fork is to chunk it like
this<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.979> gives<00:01:53.100> something<00:01:53.520> that's<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this and it gives something that's a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
this and it gives something that's a
little<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> little<00:01:54.450> different<00:01:54.810> look<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> every

little a little different look and every

and the cucumbers are there we are going
to<00:04:03.379> put<00:04:03.739> a<00:04:04.750> little<00:04:05.750> bit<00:04:06.049> of<00:04:06.470> vinegar<00:04:07.310> we're

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:08.090 
to put a little bit of vinegar we're

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.119 
to put a little bit of vinegar we're
gonna<00:04:08.209> carefully<00:04:08.690> measure<00:04:08.900> out<00:04:09.079> about<00:04:09.129> two

00:04:10.119 --> 00:04:10.129 
gonna carefully measure out about two

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:12.069 
gonna carefully measure out about two
tablespoons<00:04:10.549> we<00:04:11.000> don't<00:04:11.180> want<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.389> do<00:04:11.479> too<00:04:11.810> high

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
tablespoons we don't want to do too high

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.430 
tablespoons we don't want to do too high
too<00:04:12.560> much<00:04:12.769> of<00:04:12.919> any

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
too much of any

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:17.979 
too much of any
that<00:04:14.010> a<00:04:14.810> little<00:04:15.810> bit<00:04:15.930> of<00:04:16.019> salt

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
that a little bit of salt

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.210 
that a little bit of salt
carefully<00:04:18.989> measure<00:04:21.620> that<00:04:22.620> looks<00:04:22.830> like<00:04:23.010> a<00:04:23.040> lot

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
carefully measure that looks like a lot

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.250 
carefully measure that looks like a lot
of<00:04:23.250> salt<00:04:23.520> it<00:04:23.850> is<00:04:24.000> a<00:04:24.030> lot<00:04:24.240> of<00:04:24.270> salt<00:04:24.570> but<00:04:25.110> we're

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
of salt it is a lot of salt but we're

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.200 
of salt it is a lot of salt but we're
solving<00:04:25.500> all<00:04:25.830> the<00:04:25.950> cucumbers<00:04:26.460> and<00:04:26.610> the<00:04:26.670> sour

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
solving all the cucumbers and the sour

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.660 
solving all the cucumbers and the sour
cream<00:04:27.330> both<00:04:27.960> of<00:04:28.140> which<00:04:28.260> needs<00:04:28.560> so<00:04:28.740> we're<00:04:29.550> gonna

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
cream both of which needs so we're gonna
