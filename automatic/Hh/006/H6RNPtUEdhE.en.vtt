00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
put in automated traffic but the key

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.730 
put in automated traffic but the key

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
for links etc so since she's gonna take

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.210 
for links etc so since she's gonna take
a<00:02:43.019> little<00:02:43.230> while<00:02:43.440> I'll<00:02:43.620> see<00:02:43.769> for<00:02:43.889> it<00:02:43.950> to<00:02:44.069> go

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
a little while I'll see for it to go

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.879 
a little while I'll see for it to go
through<00:02:44.549> some<00:02:45.139> signs<00:02:46.139> don't<00:02:46.319> let<00:02:46.500> me<00:02:46.680> just

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:46.889 
through some signs don't let me just

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:48.920 
through some signs don't let me just
leave<00:02:47.040> it<00:02:47.190> running<00:02:47.310> overnight<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.780> can

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
leave it running overnight but you can

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.390 
leave it running overnight but you can
see<00:02:49.079> here<00:02:49.290> is<00:02:49.380> really<00:02:49.590> quick<00:02:49.859> list<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.130> time

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
see here is really quick list of time

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.860 
see here is really quick list of time
delay<00:02:50.700> there<00:02:50.940> too<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.209> it'll<00:02:51.389> swam<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.840> the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
delay there too so it'll swam in the

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.780 
delay there too so it'll swam in the
search<00:02:52.109> engines<00:02:52.530> per<00:02:53.250> se<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.519> see<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
search engines per se you see it

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.339 
search engines per se you see it
tickling<00:02:54.239> over<00:02:54.540> quite<00:02:54.780> nicely<00:02:54.959> there's<00:02:55.290> a

00:02:55.339 --> 00:02:55.349 
tickling over quite nicely there's a

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:57.500 
tickling over quite nicely there's a
random<00:02:55.829> time<00:02:56.400> here<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:56.760> sometimes<00:02:57.359> you'll

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
random time here so sometimes you'll

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:58.699 
random time here so sometimes you'll
find<00:02:57.750> it'll<00:02:57.900> go<00:02:58.049> through<00:02:58.290> a<00:02:58.319> couple<00:02:58.530> of

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
find it'll go through a couple of

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.530 
find it'll go through a couple of
seconds<00:02:59.010> over<00:02:59.190> time<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.549> may<00:02:59.669> take<00:02:59.880> 10<00:03:00.120> seconds

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
seconds over time it may take 10 seconds

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.540 
seconds over time it may take 10 seconds
just<00:03:01.109> to<00:03:01.230> make<00:03:01.410> sure<00:03:01.440> we<00:03:01.680> don't<00:03:01.709> get

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
just to make sure we don't get

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.820 
just to make sure we don't get
a<00:03:02.810> certain<00:03:03.810> point<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.260> view<00:03:04.410> but<00:03:04.560> you'll<00:03:04.680> see

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
a certain point of view but you'll see

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:07.130 
a certain point of view but you'll see
that<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.160> take<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.550> away<00:03:05.670> get<00:03:06.660> more<00:03:06.900> more

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
that you take it away get more more

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:09.170 
that you take it away get more more
links<00:03:07.410> back<00:03:07.530> to<00:03:07.590> your<00:03:07.800> website<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.880> how<00:03:09.030> do<00:03:09.090> we
