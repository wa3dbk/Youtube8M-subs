price on the price tag there and it said
$30<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.550> I<00:00:32.730> was<00:00:32.910> like<00:00:33.149> why<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:35.149> annual

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
$30 and I was like why is this annual

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.000 
$30 and I was like why is this annual
going<00:00:37.890> for<00:00:38.510> $30<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.260> I<00:00:40.290> looked<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.739> in<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
going for $30 so I looked it up in the

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.389 
going for $30 so I looked it up in the
price<00:00:41.670> guide<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.530> sure<00:00:43.530> enough<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.890> goes<00:00:44.070> for

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
price guide and sure enough it goes for

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.209 
price guide and sure enough it goes for
$30<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.480> they're<00:00:45.870> like<00:00:46.050> 32<00:00:46.530> in<00:00:46.739> near-mint<00:00:47.070> or

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
$30 and they're like 32 in near-mint or

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:49.490 
$30 and they're like 32 in near-mint or
something<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.550> that<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:49.050> reason<00:00:49.320> why

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
something like that and the reason why

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.430 
something like that and the reason why
is<00:00:49.559> because<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:50.160> has<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:51.239> first<00:00:51.539> brief

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
is because this has the first brief

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.360 
is because this has the first brief
appearance<00:00:53.190> of<00:00:54.020> gambit<00:00:55.020> which<00:00:56.010> I<00:00:56.129> didn't<00:00:56.340> know
