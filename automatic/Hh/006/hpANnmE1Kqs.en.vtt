00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:27.590
 Hi everyone 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:31.669
 And this time , I'm thinking of playing a mini game with a piece of graph, and I want to play a server this time 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.510
 But once again I'm playing server Dema their own well that The Five 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:37.829
 It's called a new milli game block party here 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:45.199
 Oh, it's better to be a girl 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.199
 A game has been added, so I hope to play it this time 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:56.730
 How to play the game is the same color as it comes with a comfort block on your hand 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.400
 The purpose is to stand on the ground block and survive 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.460
 Up 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.350
