00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
basically comes down to a couple of

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.810 
basically comes down to a couple of
things<00:00:37.120> the<00:00:37.360> forefoot<00:00:37.840> is<00:00:38.050> is<00:00:39.040> pretty<00:00:39.550> bulky

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:39.820 
things the forefoot is is pretty bulky

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.610 
things the forefoot is is pretty bulky
so<00:00:40.270> it<00:00:40.390> gives<00:00:40.570> you<00:00:40.690> some<00:00:40.930> room<00:00:41.410> and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
so it gives you some room and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.010 
so it gives you some room and
flexibility<00:00:42.130> for<00:00:42.400> your<00:00:42.880> toes<00:00:43.120> that<00:00:43.540> is<00:00:43.690> also<00:00:43.990> a

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
flexibility for your toes that is also a

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.080 
flexibility for your toes that is also a
little<00:00:44.230> bit<00:00:44.350> higher<00:00:44.650> than<00:00:45.010> anything<00:00:45.550> else<00:00:45.850> we

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
little bit higher than anything else we

and a customer to show me where you know
an<00:01:23.680> army<00:01:24.040> green<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:24.880> shoelace<00:01:25.630> is<00:01:25.870> also<00:01:26.320> being

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
an army green the shoelace is also being

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.100 
an army green the shoelace is also being
done<00:01:26.890> with<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.670> same<00:01:27.880> color<00:01:28.180> so<00:01:28.630> yet<00:01:28.840> quite<00:01:29.080> a

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
done with the same color so yet quite a

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.020 
done with the same color so yet quite a
strong<00:01:29.470> look<00:01:29.740> here<00:01:29.979> it<00:01:30.159> matched<00:01:30.400> is<00:01:30.640> obviously

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
strong look here it matched is obviously

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:33.960 
strong look here it matched is obviously
the<00:01:31.270> Harris<00:01:31.870> Tweed<00:01:32.140> inside<00:01:32.590> what<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.610> truly

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:33.970 
the Harris Tweed inside what is truly

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.359 
the Harris Tweed inside what is truly
unique<00:01:34.180> about<00:01:34.450> this<00:01:34.690> outsole<00:01:35.440> is<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:35.979> the

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
unique about this outsole is is the

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:38.580 
unique about this outsole is is the
extra<00:01:36.760> layer<00:01:36.970> here<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.510> in<00:01:37.960> this<00:01:38.049> case<00:01:38.320> it's

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
extra layer here so in this case it's

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.710 
extra layer here so in this case it's
actually<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:38.979> double<00:01:39.400> layer<00:01:39.729> outsole

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
construction which makes it extremely

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:45.060 
construction which makes it extremely
thick<00:01:42.820> this<00:01:43.330> is<00:01:43.540> a<00:01:43.570> heavy<00:01:43.869> strong<00:01:44.350> boot<00:01:44.680> and
