00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
races that's just what it sounds like

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.370 
races that's just what it sounds like
two<00:01:43.490> or<00:01:43.640> three<00:01:43.670> lap<00:01:43.970> races<00:01:44.360> across<00:01:44.600> all<00:01:45.080> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
different levels of that were showing

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.790 
different levels of that were showing
off<00:01:47.450> including<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:47.990> airport<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.649> the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
off including the airport and the

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.980

line<00:01:51.229> was<00:01:51.590> the<00:01:51.740> winner<00:01:51.920> with<00:01:52.729> survival<00:01:53.180> mode

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:53.330 
line was the winner with survival mode

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.930 
line was the winner with survival mode
the<00:01:53.479> idea<00:01:53.780> is<00:01:54.050> to<00:01:54.530> pass<00:01:54.740> as<00:01:54.950> many<00:01:55.220> huge<00:01:55.550> tanker

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:55.940 
the idea is to pass as many huge tanker

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.060 
the idea is to pass as many huge tanker
trucks<00:01:56.180> as<00:01:56.330> you<00:01:56.450> can<00:01:56.690> the<00:01:57.200> more<00:01:57.380> tanker<00:01:57.830> trucks

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
trucks as you can the more tanker trucks

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.190 
trucks as you can the more tanker trucks
you<00:01:58.220> pass<00:01:58.429> in<00:01:58.700> a<00:01:58.789> row<00:01:58.940> the<00:01:59.360> higher<00:01:59.569> your<00:01:59.750> combo

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
you pass in a row the higher your combo

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.630 
you pass in a row the higher your combo
