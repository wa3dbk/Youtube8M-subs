the win out we had to work for it at the
end<00:02:10.769> with<00:02:10.950> about<00:02:11.159> I<00:02:11.189> think<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.489> was<00:02:11.610> about<00:02:11.700> five

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
end with about I think it was about five

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.730 
end with about I think it was about five
laps<00:02:12.240> left<00:02:12.599> they<00:02:12.810> had<00:02:12.900> another<00:02:13.170> caution<00:02:13.620> you

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
laps left they had another caution you

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.410 
laps left they had another caution you
were<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:14.220> have<00:02:14.400> the<00:02:14.580> lead<00:02:14.730> and<00:02:14.760> I<00:02:15.060> thought<00:02:15.240> for

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
were you have the lead and I thought for

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.339 
were you have the lead and I thought for
sure<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.720> were<00:02:15.780> just<00:02:15.840> gonna<00:02:16.020> take<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
sure you were just gonna take the

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.250 
sure you were just gonna take the
checkers<00:02:16.680> and<00:02:16.830> yet<00:02:16.950> another

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
checkers and yet another

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.960 
checkers and yet another

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
restart and had to get by Tim yeah I

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.940 
restart and had to get by Tim yeah I
mean<00:02:19.269> this<00:02:19.420> is<00:02:19.689> this<00:02:20.110> is<00:02:20.170> one<00:02:20.470> of<00:02:20.560> those<00:02:20.650> things

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
mean this is this is one of those things

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.770 
mean this is this is one of those things
where<00:02:21.189> this<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:21.939> a<00:02:22.000> really<00:02:22.329> tough<00:02:22.510> racetrack

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
where this is a really tough racetrack

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.910 
where this is a really tough racetrack
to<00:02:23.200> to<00:02:24.159> be<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.579> leader<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.319> to<00:02:26.319> know<00:02:26.590> when<00:02:26.799> the

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
to to be the leader and to know when the

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:29.039 
to to be the leader and to know when the
trace<00:02:27.220> plays<00:02:27.459> out<00:02:27.670> 40<00:02:28.090> laps<00:02:28.239> here<00:02:28.510> it<00:02:28.629> changes

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:29.049 
trace plays out 40 laps here it changes

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.199 
trace plays out 40 laps here it changes
so<00:02:29.290> much<00:02:29.530> and<00:02:30.459> you<00:02:30.579> don't<00:02:30.730> know<00:02:30.849> if<00:02:30.939> you<00:02:31.030> should

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:31.209 
so much and you don't know if you should

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:32.670 
so much and you don't know if you should
be<00:02:31.510> restarting<00:02:31.989> on<00:02:32.079> the<00:02:32.140> bottom<00:02:32.470> at<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:32.620> top

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
be restarting on the bottom at the top

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.559 
be restarting on the bottom at the top
or<00:02:33.159> if<00:02:33.189> the<00:02:33.370> bottoms<00:02:33.700> come<00:02:33.970> in<00:02:34.120> and<00:02:34.299> the<00:02:34.360> top

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
or if the bottoms come in and the top

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.110 
or if the bottoms come in and the top
gets<00:02:34.810> too<00:02:34.989> technical<00:02:35.530> or<00:02:35.560> falls<00:02:35.860> off<00:02:36.069> so<00:02:36.459> you'd

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
gets too technical or falls off so you'd

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.789 
gets too technical or falls off so you'd
had<00:02:37.239> all<00:02:37.390> these<00:02:37.540> restarts<00:02:37.989> and<00:02:38.290> especially<00:02:38.530> in

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
had all these restarts and especially in

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:40.110 
had all these restarts and especially in
the<00:02:38.890> beginning<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.400> race<00:02:39.549> you<00:02:39.849> know<00:02:39.879> my

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
the beginning of the race you know my

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.330 
the beginning of the race you know my
first<00:02:40.390> start<00:02:40.659> went<00:02:40.870> not<00:02:41.500> so<00:02:41.709> well<00:02:41.890> and<00:02:42.129> we<00:02:42.220> got

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
first start went not so well and we got

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.550 
first start went not so well and we got
another<00:02:42.730> chance<00:02:43.030> and<00:02:43.329> I<00:02:43.390> had<00:02:43.780> good<00:02:43.989> restarts

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
another chance and I had good restarts

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.880 
another chance and I had good restarts
but<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:45.310> know<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:46.450> was<00:02:46.599> just<00:02:46.780> plagued<00:02:47.709> with

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
but you know it was just plagued with

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.099 
but you know it was just plagued with
restarts<00:02:48.549> which<00:02:48.670> was<00:02:48.909> kind<00:02:49.510> of<00:02:49.569> short<00:02:49.810> track

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
restarts which was kind of short track

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.190 
restarts which was kind of short track
which<00:02:50.379> made<00:02:50.590> it<00:02:50.709> exciting<00:02:51.129> for<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.400> fans<00:02:51.640> and

which made it exciting for the fans and
very<00:02:53.200> nerve-wracking<00:02:53.739> for<00:02:53.769> me<00:02:54.090> but<00:02:55.090> luckily

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
very nerve-wracking for me but luckily

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.270
