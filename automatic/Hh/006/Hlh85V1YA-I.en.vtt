00:03:22.509 --> 00:03:22.519 
something that that works and I've toyed

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.160 
something that that works and I've toyed
with<00:03:22.550> the<00:03:22.760> idea<00:03:22.790> of<00:03:23.150> doing<00:03:23.269> a<00:03:23.480> home<00:03:23.660> gym<00:03:23.870> thing

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
with the idea of doing a home gym thing

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.410 
with the idea of doing a home gym thing
but<00:03:24.410> it's<00:03:24.980> expensive<00:03:25.610> and<00:03:25.850> I<00:03:25.880> just<00:03:26.120> I<00:03:26.239> don't

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
but it's expensive and I just I don't

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.699 
but it's expensive and I just I don't
have<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.600> space<00:03:26.810> or<00:03:27.019> anything<00:03:27.200> for<00:03:27.500> it<00:03:27.530> right

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 
have the space or anything for it right

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:30.100 
have the space or anything for it right
now<00:03:27.739> so<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.430> spoke<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.239> gym<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:29.660> up<00:03:29.900> the

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
looking around for gyms that are

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.100 
looking around for gyms that are
somewhat<00:03:34.910> local<00:03:35.330> that<00:03:35.450> might<00:03:35.630> allow<00:03:35.900> me<00:03:36.019> to

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:36.110 
somewhat local that might allow me to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.110 
somewhat local that might allow me to
film<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.620> are<00:03:36.739> more<00:03:37.370> focused<00:03:37.610> around<00:03:37.880> my

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
film that are more focused around my

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910

first<00:04:27.120> day<00:04:27.300> there<00:04:27.330> but<00:04:27.810> maybe<00:04:28.560> I'll<00:04:28.770> sign<00:04:29.010> up

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
first day there but maybe I'll sign up

first day there but maybe I'll sign up
there<00:04:29.370> for<00:04:29.580> a<00:04:29.610> month<00:04:29.910> and<00:04:30.240> kind<00:04:31.050> of<00:04:31.140> see<00:04:31.320> where

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
there for a month and kind of see where

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.410 
there for a month and kind of see where
things<00:04:31.740> go<00:04:31.920> since<00:04:32.430> I<00:04:32.520> said<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.940> owners<00:04:33.300> on

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
things go since I said the owners on

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.180 
things go since I said the owners on
vacation<00:04:33.900> from<00:04:34.080> my<00:04:34.170> original<00:04:34.380> gym<00:04:34.800> for<00:04:34.980> a<00:04:35.040> week

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
vacation from my original gym for a week

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.320 
vacation from my original gym for a week
or<00:04:35.340> so<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:37.010> figured<00:04:38.010> and<00:04:38.400> I'm<00:04:38.910> still<00:04:39.090> under

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
or so I figured and I'm still under

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:40.940 
or so I figured and I'm still under
contract<00:04:39.810> at<00:04:39.930> that<00:04:39.960> gym<00:04:40.290> for<00:04:40.530> a<00:04:40.560> year<00:04:40.800> so<00:04:40.920> I

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:40.950 
contract at that gym for a year so I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.620 
contract at that gym for a year so I
have<00:04:41.160> to<00:04:41.280> see<00:04:41.430> what<00:04:41.670> the<00:04:41.820> owner<00:04:41.970> will<00:04:42.210> work<00:04:42.390> out

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
have to see what the owner will work out

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.690 
have to see what the owner will work out
if<00:04:42.840> I<00:04:43.230> decide<00:04:43.590> to<00:04:43.740> sign<00:04:43.890> up<00:04:44.040> at<00:04:44.160> this<00:04:44.280> new<00:04:44.460> gym

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
if I decide to sign up at this new gym

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.850 
if I decide to sign up at this new gym
can<00:04:45.180> I<00:04:45.300> somehow<00:04:45.690> get<00:04:45.960> out<00:04:46.110> of<00:04:46.230> that<00:04:46.290> contract

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
can I somehow get out of that contract

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.650 
can I somehow get out of that contract
so<00:04:47.130> these<00:04:47.550> are<00:04:47.760> things<00:04:47.940> I<00:04:48.000> need<00:04:48.060> to<00:04:48.180> figure<00:04:48.480> out

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
so these are things I need to figure out

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.690 
so these are things I need to figure out
but<00:04:48.840> I'll<00:04:49.110> probably<00:04:49.380> be<00:04:49.800> signing<00:04:50.220> up<00:04:50.310> for<00:04:50.640> a

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:50.700 
but I'll probably be signing up for a

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.790 
but I'll probably be signing up for a
month<00:04:51.120> at<00:04:51.360> this<00:04:51.840> gym<00:04:52.050> that's<00:04:52.260> close<00:04:52.530> to<00:04:52.680> my
