 hello how about greets them educationally and 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.980
 today we are going to talk about 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.570
 microsoft if a few days ago 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.469
 first the report was put that in the 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.690
 xbox 1 the indies developers were going to 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.490
 put your games 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.920
 themselves without the help of others 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.070
 great houses that support them and good 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.800
 a few hours later it was confirmed that 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.590
 Xbox 1 was to support all 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.020
 indies developers so all 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.300
 edition to be able to publish their own 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.750
 games in the xbox 1 and everything perfect 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.760
 everyone happy a great support for the 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.770
 videogames and not for independents 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.200
 good today a new report in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.800
 which says that microsoft is going to leave 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.770
 to the developers 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:53.690
 publish your own games on the xbox 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:57.170
 360 at the beginning of August 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.379
 if at the beginning of August or before 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.730
 index developers where I know 

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.220
 I think it has to stop like the 10,000 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.799
 dollars I think to publish your game and 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.220
 apart 15 thousand to patch only in the 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:12.259
 xbox 360 if it is confirmed because 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.790
 that's what a person who works for 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:17.060
 days and I wanted to put the mode of this 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.340
 beige and good of the weapon 3 the pot and 130 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.039
 but commented everything that Microsoft asked for 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.619
 but fine if this is to be true 

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:29.610
 already at the beginning of August we will see more 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:32.430
 indies games in the xbox 360 bazaar 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.590
 that image is not the box's going to 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.360
 support pretty much the indies games and 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.720
 because we have not 360 since a lot 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.310
 360 people will move to the Xbox 1 to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.560
 be the best way to keep a 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.930
 public that does not have access to the xbox 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.700
 one does not have good money are going to other 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.650
 games so that it stays is not very 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.790
 well and it's very good I applaud that so 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.790
 that the people of microsoft are 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.470

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.760
