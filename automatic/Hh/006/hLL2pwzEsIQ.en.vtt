00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:23.750 
actually see on the screen that there is

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.690 
actually see on the screen that there is
a<00:00:23.779> Wi-Fi<00:00:24.200> that<00:00:24.500> I<00:00:24.560> need<00:00:24.800> to<00:00:24.950> connect<00:00:25.189> to<00:00:25.369> which

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:25.700 
a Wi-Fi that I need to connect to which

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.040 
a Wi-Fi that I need to connect to which
is<00:00:25.849> predictor<00:00:26.660> to<00:00:26.869> five<00:00:27.140> 9s<00:00:28.449> so<00:00:29.449> I<00:00:29.480> will<00:00:29.869> see

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
is predictor to five 9s so I will see

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.070 
is predictor to five 9s so I will see
the<00:00:30.340> password<00:00:31.340> that<00:00:31.490> I<00:00:31.550> need<00:00:31.789> to<00:00:31.910> enter<00:00:32.239> so

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:33.080 
the password that I need to enter so

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:35.320 
the password that I need to enter so
basically<00:00:33.739> this<00:00:34.129> is<00:00:34.190> the<00:00:34.430> same<00:00:34.640> password<00:00:34.879> as<00:00:35.120> I

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:35.330 
basically this is the same password as I

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.729 
basically this is the same password as I
see<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:35.900> on<00:00:36.110> screen

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
see it on screen

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:46.030 
see it on screen
so<00:00:37.580> which<00:00:37.760> is<00:00:37.940> P<00:00:38.269> I<00:00:38.570> J<00:00:40.210> 2<00:00:41.210> 9<00:00:41.750> 3<00:00:42.440> 8<00:00:43.540> so<00:00:44.739> I'm<00:00:45.739> going

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
so which is P I J 2 9 3 8 so I'm going

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.360 
so which is P I J 2 9 3 8 so I'm going
to<00:00:46.100> quickly<00:00:46.309> just<00:00:46.579> enter<00:00:47.300> the<00:00:47.450> password<00:00:47.870> and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
to quickly just enter the password and

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:53.139 
to quickly just enter the password and
then<00:00:49.370> connect<00:00:50.180> go<00:00:50.480> to<00:00:50.540> my<00:00:51.140> projector<00:00:51.559> comm<00:00:52.160> or

00:00:53.139 --> 00:00:53.149 
then connect go to my projector comm or

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.410 
then connect go to my projector comm or
projector<00:00:53.719> comes<00:00:54.200> /downloads<00:00:55.000> to<00:00:56.000> download

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
projector comes /downloads to download

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.209 
projector comes /downloads to download
it<00:00:56.570> if<00:00:56.719> in<00:00:56.840> case<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:57.230> don't<00:00:57.379> have<00:00:57.500> the<00:00:57.829> app<00:00:58.010> as

00:00:58.209 --> 00:00:58.219 
it if in case you don't have the app as

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:01.240 
it if in case you don't have the app as
yet<00:00:58.660> so<00:00:59.660> I'm<00:00:59.780> going<00:01:00.020> to<00:01:00.079> quickly<00:01:00.289> just<00:01:00.440> double

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
yet so I'm going to quickly just double

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.060 
yet so I'm going to quickly just double
click<00:01:01.430> on<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.559> there's<00:01:03.559> a<00:01:03.649> little<00:01:03.890> app

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
click on this and there's a little app

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.310 
click on this and there's a little app
that<00:01:04.100> just<00:01:04.430> pops<00:01:05.420> up<00:01:05.660> and<00:01:06.020> you<00:01:06.140> can

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
that just pops up and you can

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.249 
that just pops up and you can
essentially<00:01:06.710> see<00:01:07.270> as<00:01:08.270> soon<00:01:08.509> as<00:01:08.660> it<00:01:08.780> opens<00:01:09.110> up

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
essentially see as soon as it opens up

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:12.540 
essentially see as soon as it opens up
as<00:01:09.530> you<00:01:09.680> see<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.160> it<00:01:10.430> has<00:01:11.090> recognized<00:01:11.780> that

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
as you see that it has recognized that

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.980 
as you see that it has recognized that
there<00:01:13.550> is<00:01:13.670> a<00:01:13.700> projector<00:01:14.539> that<00:01:14.780> it<00:01:14.899> is

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
there is a projector that it is

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.679 
there is a projector that it is
connected<00:01:15.470> to<00:01:15.790> all<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:16.850> need<00:01:17.150> to<00:01:17.299> essentially

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
connected to all I need to essentially

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.140 
connected to all I need to essentially
do<00:01:18.020> is<00:01:18.049> to<00:01:18.500> quickly<00:01:18.799> click<00:01:19.400> on<00:01:19.700> the<00:01:19.909> share

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:20.150

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
button to start sharing my entire screen

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.240 
button to start sharing my entire screen
so<00:01:24.189> then<00:01:25.189> you<00:01:25.310> go<00:01:25.490> I<00:01:25.670> quickly<00:01:26.299> clicked<00:01:27.070> as<00:01:28.070> soon

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
so then you go I quickly clicked as soon

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.950 
so then you go I quickly clicked as soon
as<00:01:28.369> you<00:01:28.460> do<00:01:28.610> that<00:01:28.640> it<00:01:28.939> takes<00:01:29.090> a<00:01:29.390> couple<00:01:29.840> of

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
as you do that it takes a couple of

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.920 
as you do that it takes a couple of
seconds<00:01:30.350> very<00:01:30.710> quickly<00:01:30.979> and<00:01:31.509> it<00:01:32.509> started

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
seconds very quickly and it started

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
seconds very quickly and it started
transmission<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.310> now<00:01:34.960> I'm<00:01:35.960> able<00:01:36.380> to<00:01:36.619> kind<00:01:36.799> of

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
transmission so now I'm able to kind of

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.190 
transmission so now I'm able to kind of
actually

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
actually

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.060 
actually
share<00:01:39.200> my<00:01:39.440> complete<00:01:39.830> screen<00:01:40.270> so<00:01:42.070> here

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.070 
share my complete screen so here

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.470 
share my complete screen so here
basically<00:01:43.310> in<00:01:43.880> case<00:01:44.060> I<00:01:44.240> want<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:45.310> start

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:46.480 
basically in case I want to start

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.860 
basically in case I want to start
sharing<00:01:47.480> some<00:01:47.720> stuff<00:01:48.230> then<00:01:48.890> basically<00:01:49.870> you

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
sharing some stuff then basically you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.380 
sharing some stuff then basically you
know<00:01:51.020> quickly<00:01:51.380> I<00:01:51.560> can<00:01:51.920> just<00:01:52.100> go<00:01:52.460> about<00:01:52.790> so<00:01:53.240> you

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
know quickly I can just go about so you

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:00.250 
know quickly I can just go about so you
can<00:01:53.570> see<00:01:55.870> look<00:01:56.870> at<00:01:57.050> the<00:01:57.170> speed<00:01:58.840> of<00:01:59.840> actually

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:00.260 
can see look at the speed of actually

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.770 
can see look at the speed of actually
accessing<00:02:03.400> and<00:02:04.400> that<00:02:04.700> essentially<00:02:05.300> is<00:02:05.510> being

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:05.780 
accessing and that essentially is being

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.550 
accessing and that essentially is being
shared<00:02:06.080> on<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.580> large<00:02:07.910> screen<00:02:08.180> as<00:02:08.420> well<00:02:08.600> so<00:02:09.410> if

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
shared on the large screen as well so if

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.820 
shared on the large screen as well so if
in<00:02:09.710> case<00:02:09.920> there<00:02:10.160> is<00:02:10.190> a<00:02:10.900> specific<00:02:11.900> presentation

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
in case there is a specific presentation

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.020 
in case there is a specific presentation
I<00:02:12.950> need<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.280> share<00:02:13.550> so<00:02:14.420> there<00:02:14.840> you<00:02:14.930> go<00:02:15.140> so<00:02:15.730> and<00:02:16.730> I

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
I need to share so there you go so and I

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.110 
I need to share so there you go so and I
can<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.930> go<00:02:18.170> from<00:02:18.610> this<00:02:19.610> mode<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:21.200> the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
can just go from this mode to the

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
can just go from this mode to the
complete<00:02:24.310> slideshow<00:02:25.310> mode<00:02:25.540> so<00:02:26.540> what<00:02:26.720> happens

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
complete slideshow mode so what happens

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.330 
complete slideshow mode so what happens
essentially

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
essentially

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.089 
essentially
you<00:02:28.550> know<00:02:28.640> he<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:28.790> goes<00:02:29.150> up<00:02:29.300> into<00:02:29.599> that<00:02:29.720> more

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:30.099 
you know he just goes up into that more

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.780 
you know he just goes up into that more
from<00:02:31.099> then<00:02:31.310> on<00:02:31.520> very<00:02:31.940> quickly<00:02:32.739> you<00:02:33.739> know<00:02:33.890> I<00:02:34.160> am

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
from then on very quickly you know I am

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.380 
from then on very quickly you know I am
able<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.800> move<00:02:36.800> over<00:02:37.130> and<00:02:37.489> kind<00:02:37.970> of<00:02:38.030> actually

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
able to move over and kind of actually

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.410 
able to move over and kind of actually
start<00:02:38.690> sharing<00:02:38.930> my<00:02:39.230> presentation<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.520> I<00:02:40.849> can

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:41.420 
start sharing my presentation so I can

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.070 
start sharing my presentation so I can
move<00:02:41.540> back<00:02:41.750> I<00:02:42.819> can<00:02:43.819> move<00:02:43.970> forward<00:02:44.030> so<00:02:44.930> I<00:02:45.410> mean

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
move back I can move forward so I mean

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.460 
move back I can move forward so I mean
it's<00:02:48.080> pretty<00:02:48.290> simple

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
it's pretty simple

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.030 
it's pretty simple
right

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.789 

so<00:02:53.640> that's<00:02:53.939> how<00:02:54.360> exactly<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.080> can<00:02:55.290> get<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.620> get

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
so that's how exactly you can get to get

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.869 
so that's how exactly you can get to get
smaller<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:58.489> literally<00:02:59.489> are<00:02:59.640> kind<00:02:59.849> of

00:02:59.869 --> 00:02:59.879 
smaller and literally are kind of

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.460 
smaller and literally are kind of
actually<00:03:00.269> finished<00:03:01.879> just<00:03:02.879> open<00:03:03.390> up<00:03:03.510> a<00:03:03.840> YouTube

video

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580

that few people in this world will
revolutionize<00:03:46.390> one<00:03:46.840> industry<00:03:47.350> Steve<00:03:47.920> Jobs
