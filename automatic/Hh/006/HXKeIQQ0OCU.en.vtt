00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
video we will cover the top 9 supercars

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.440 
video we will cover the top 9 supercars
because<00:00:54.890> there's<00:00:55.070> only<00:00:55.250> nine<00:00:55.550> supercars<00:00:56.300> on

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:56.450 
because there's only nine supercars on

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.210 
because there's only nine supercars on
the<00:00:56.540> game<00:00:56.750> which<00:00:57.020> isn't<00:00:57.350> enough<00:00:57.560> for<00:00:57.739> a<00:00:57.770> top<00:00:57.980> 10

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
the game which isn't enough for a top 10

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.370 
the game which isn't enough for a top 10
obviously<00:00:58.760> I<00:00:58.940> basically<00:00:59.390> just<00:00:59.690> ranked<00:01:00.260> the

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:00.380 
obviously I basically just ranked the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.500 
obviously I basically just ranked the
supercars<00:01:00.980> this<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:01.940> think<00:01:02.000> the<00:01:02.239> fourth

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
supercars this is I think the fourth

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.689 
supercars this is I think the fourth

looks kind of like a high-performance
racing<00:03:38.730> car<00:03:39.209> with<00:03:39.989> all<00:03:40.140> the<00:03:40.260> curves<00:03:40.560> it<00:03:40.829> has<00:03:41.010> to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
racing car with all the curves it has to

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.360 
racing car with all the curves it has to
it<00:03:41.489> it's<00:03:42.360> slightly<00:03:42.780> customizable<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:43.890> has

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
it it's slightly customizable and has

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.759 
it it's slightly customizable and has
good<00:03:44.640> speed<00:03:45.000> and<00:03:45.239> nice<00:03:45.450> handling<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> but

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:46.769 
good speed and nice handling to it but

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.449 
good speed and nice handling to it but
just<00:03:46.950> lacks<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.519> tad<00:03:47.880> in<00:03:48.329> speed<00:03:49.049> and<00:03:49.459> basically

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
just lacks a tad in speed and basically

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.759 
just lacks a tad in speed and basically
speed<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.480> deciding<00:03:51.900> factor<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.650> this

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
speed is the deciding factor in this

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:56.030 
speed is the deciding factor in this
supercar<00:03:53.310> category<00:03:53.910> as<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:54.930> see<00:03:55.170> the

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:56.040 
supercar category as you can see the

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.640 
supercar category as you can see the
handling<00:03:56.519> is<00:03:56.640> okay<00:03:57.480> on<00:03:57.660> all<00:03:57.810> these<00:03:57.989> cars<00:03:58.320> but

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
handling is okay on all these cars but

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.890 
handling is okay on all these cars but
it's<00:03:59.220> basically<00:03:59.459> the<00:03:59.790> speed<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.390> ranks<00:04:00.750> all

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
it's basically the speed that ranks all

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.840 
it's basically the speed that ranks all
these<00:04:01.049> cars<00:04:01.320> next<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.400> number<00:04:02.640> two<00:04:02.820> spot
