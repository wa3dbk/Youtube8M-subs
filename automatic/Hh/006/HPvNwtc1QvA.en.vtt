let's<00:04:21.350> see<00:04:21.500> if<00:04:21.560> we<00:04:21.650> can<00:04:21.830> try<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.490> install<00:04:23.330> this

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
let's see if we can try to install this

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.879 
let's see if we can try to install this
see<00:04:25.190> how<00:04:25.310> this<00:04:25.430> works<00:04:26.060> looks<00:04:26.870> like<00:04:27.020> goes<00:04:27.230> this

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
see how this works looks like goes this

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:38.140 
see how this works looks like goes this
way<00:04:29.320> so<00:04:30.320> you<00:04:31.280> got<00:04:31.460> this<00:04:36.520> looks<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.669> it<00:04:37.790> goes

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.150 
way so you got this looks like it goes

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:55.540 
way so you got this looks like it goes
here<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:41.000> push<00:04:53.590> do<00:04:54.590> something<00:04:55.010> look<00:04:55.160> slow

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
here you push do something look slow

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:08.250 
here you push do something look slow
we're<00:04:56.270> getting<00:04:56.570> off<00:05:03.130> now<00:05:04.130> there<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.400> go

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:08.260 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:15.360 

so<00:05:09.260> we've<00:05:09.380> got<00:05:10.060> that<00:05:11.060> secured<00:05:12.280> and<00:05:13.280> I<00:05:14.090> guess

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
so we've got that secured and I guess

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.740 
so we've got that secured and I guess
all<00:05:16.370> you<00:05:16.430> have<00:05:16.580> to<00:05:16.729> do<00:05:16.850> is<00:05:17.210> get<00:05:17.390> this<00:05:17.479> ball

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
all you have to do is get this ball

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:26.500 
all you have to do is get this ball
inside<00:05:18.050> the<00:05:18.110> hole<00:05:24.820> let's<00:05:25.820> not<00:05:25.970> work

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:26.510 
inside the hole let's not work

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:33.370 
inside the hole let's not work
I<00:05:26.540> want<00:05:27.470> to<00:05:27.530> force<00:05:27.830> it<00:05:28.010> and<00:05:28.130> break<00:05:28.490> it<00:05:30.910> up<00:05:32.380> this

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
I want to force it and break it up this

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.159 
I want to force it and break it up this
is<00:05:33.500> bad<00:05:33.740> mister<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:34.370> one<00:05:34.870> detach<00:05:35.870> it<00:05:36.140> from

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
is bad mister this one detach it from

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:52.200 
is bad mister this one detach it from
the<00:05:36.470> nose<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:45.200> know<00:05:45.320> what<00:05:45.440> safer<00:05:46.220> I<00:05:46.430> think<00:05:47.000> I

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:52.210 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:57.490 

think<00:05:53.210> it's<00:05:53.330> safer<00:05:53.600> to<00:05:53.630> take<00:05:53.780> off<00:05:56.380> we<00:05:57.380> don't

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
think it's safer to take off we don't

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.190 
think it's safer to take off we don't
want<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.800> damage<00:05:57.979> the<00:05:58.220> units<00:05:58.700> I<00:05:58.910> know<00:05:59.750> the<00:06:00.050> yeah

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:19.210 

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:23.730 

yeah<00:06:20.210> got<00:06:20.750> it<00:06:21.520> so<00:06:22.520> that's<00:06:22.700> what<00:06:22.850> it<00:06:22.910> looks<00:06:23.120> like
