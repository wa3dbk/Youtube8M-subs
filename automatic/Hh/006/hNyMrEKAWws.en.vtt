right<00:00:19.020> now<00:00:19.970> sink<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.060> you<00:00:21.390> see<00:00:21.689> faucet<00:00:22.590> that

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
right now sink that you see faucet that

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.000 
right now sink that you see faucet that
you<00:00:22.890> see<00:00:23.160> is<00:00:23.840> on<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> on<00:00:25.140> position<00:00:25.439> but

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
you see is on the on position but

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.450 
you see is on the on position but
there's<00:00:26.220> no<00:00:26.369> water<00:00:26.640> coming<00:00:27.300> through<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:28.460> this

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
there's no water coming through it this

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.150 
there's no water coming through it this
is<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.820> remote<00:00:30.210> control<00:00:30.660> similar<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.859> what<00:00:32.009> you

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
is a remote control similar to what you

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.160 
is a remote control similar to what you
have<00:00:32.309> in<00:00:32.430> your<00:00:32.550> car<00:00:32.820> it's<00:00:33.540> got<00:00:33.630> an<00:00:33.780> on/off

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
have in your car it's got an on/off

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:40.690 
have in your car it's got an on/off
switch<00:00:34.200> let's<00:00:34.920> turn<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.340> on

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:40.700 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:52.080 

and<00:00:41.300> we<00:00:41.600> could<00:00:41.780> turn<00:00:41.960> it<00:00:42.110> off

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.090 

probably<00:00:53.090> wondering<00:00:53.570> what<00:00:53.720> this<00:00:53.750> is<00:00:54.170> well

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
probably wondering what this is well

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.210

house and I'm going to then pour some
water<00:01:58.460> on<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.970> sponge<00:01:59.090> because<00:02:00.020> we<00:02:00.890> could

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
water on the sponge because we could

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.630 
water on the sponge because we could
imagine<00:02:02.560> locating<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.740> cannons<00:02:04.400> which

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
imagine locating this cannons which

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.229 
imagine locating this cannons which
anywhere<00:02:05.330> that<00:02:06.229> water<00:02:06.560> might<00:02:06.979> leak<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.580> when

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:08.239 
anywhere that water might leak and when

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.850 
anywhere that water might leak and when
i'm<00:02:08.630> going<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:08.840> show<00:02:08.989> you<00:02:09.019> what<00:02:09.260> happens<00:02:09.649> when

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
i'm going to show you what happens when

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.370 
i'm going to show you what happens when
that<00:02:09.890> sponge<00:02:10.459> it's<00:02:10.880> wet<00:02:11.269> so<00:02:12.019> i'm<00:02:12.170> going<00:02:12.260> to

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that sponge it's wet so i'm going to

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.040 
that sponge it's wet so i'm going to
turn<00:02:12.470> on<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.680> water

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.580 

a<00:02:18.170> little<00:02:18.830> water<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.100> a<00:02:19.220> cup<00:02:19.400> now<00:02:23.260> try<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.290> do<00:02:24.500> it

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
a little water in a cup now try to do it

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.780 
a little water in a cup now try to do it
from<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.830> back<00:02:25.040> so<00:02:25.220> you<00:02:25.310> can<00:02:25.460> see<00:02:25.670> what

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
from the back so you can see what

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:33.990 
from the back so you can see what
happens

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.949 

that's<00:02:35.000> all<00:02:35.180> it<00:02:35.299> takes<00:02:35.510> to<00:02:35.959> control<00:02:36.859> a<00:02:37.659> leak<00:02:38.659> in

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
that's all it takes to control a leak in

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.800 
that's all it takes to control a leak in
your<00:02:39.019> house<00:02:39.349> if<00:02:39.709> there's<00:02:40.400> no<00:02:40.640> pressure<00:02:41.480> you

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
your house if there's no pressure you

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.440 
your house if there's no pressure you
can't<00:02:42.079> have<00:02:42.260> a<00:02:42.290> leak<00:02:42.620> you'll<00:02:43.489> also<00:02:43.670> save<00:02:44.120> water

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:44.450 
can't have a leak you'll also save water

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.929 
can't have a leak you'll also save water
because<00:02:45.079> if<00:02:45.709> there's<00:02:46.010> no<00:02:46.219> pressure<00:02:46.519> during

00:02:46.929 --> 00:02:46.939 
because if there's no pressure during

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.589 
because if there's no pressure during
the<00:02:47.120> night<00:02:47.329> and<00:02:47.629> your<00:02:48.129> toilet<00:02:49.129> tank<00:02:50.030> empties
