 Search without a further follow five 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.110
 things in minecraft you do not have yet 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.670
 I knew did again a few 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.299
 and you are now 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.920
 turn it back on 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.170
 to write in the comments how many 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.869
 of the things you already knew and 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.300
 how many not so yet 10 525 3 out of 5 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.949
 and who also has ideas of things 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.359
 I inevitably everyone can do 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.519
 I like to write a pn 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.009
 Send a whole one when it's good 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.600
 you soon with the video so here 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.910
 another small note please really 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.079
 the playlist of watch the following 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.030
 which I have already uploaded 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.829
 because now half of the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.750
 things that I got sent 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.430
 I have not shown so well 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.170
 Therefore please put off for now because 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.789
 then I would show again 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.780
 Of course not then it works 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.719
 go with the first part of the 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.980
 first part is from my bot two and 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.840
 He gave me a little video about it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.520
 Cleverly explained the whole thing and indeed 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.840
 he would have something like that here 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.140
 were with the hidden box in the 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.700
 Another option is to ski 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.830
 crate the stink normal blocks 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.720
 hide in there so to press 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.580
 say and that blocks just as 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.780
 Pillows i can show off with it 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.760
 meant is the whole video shown 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.009
 moment and two weeks in the slopes 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.390
 Then we'll go to there 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.580
 here comes a track with one 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:22.770
 fixed mainka gate on and erased away 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.450
 on it but just have Christmas here 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.340
 we also have the christmas boxes 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.900
 and forgive me for knowing down here 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 proposes to change the track on 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.210
 lands and there sets my commission there 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.159
 an ear towards the example so the block 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.420
 The man should see as runways and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.170
 now we have practically this block 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.540
 be in the pushed my card yes 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.159
 that gone away and now we have 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.570
 handy in the block or that mine 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.430
 cold inside it is is now quite 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.470
 just hide in the wall with 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.119
 stink normal blocks and now have 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.930
 the wall and we can just 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.430
 Use this blog here as a box 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.100
 that's not bad just once 60 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.210
 then it works properly 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.770
 you have the mainka accordingly 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.840
 open and can my life say here 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.180
 is a perfect hideaway i was there 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.619
 If nobody comes on it then I would say 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.229
 It would also be the first thing 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.629
 it goes on to the next one 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.430
 the next thing is from philipp lÃ¶pfe 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:15.959
 he writes you know that if you 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 a block of ice is sitting in the air and the 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.349
 then degrades then no water comes out 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.500
 if placed on the floor then 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.640
 you have to be built out of water 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.180
 not tried anymore 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.250
 indeed 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.049
 usually block is yes blog us 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.330
 can destroy it and there comes water 

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.310
 out if the block but hovered 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.700
 the air is no water rushing 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:39.599
 will just destroy so question is where 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.280
 The sense is actually theoretical 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.930
 No matter how the blog has happened 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 the same effect comes but does 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.730
 unfortunately not okay 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.879
 The next thing is multi 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.790
 minecraft 753 is signing since 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.950
 update 17.2 there are so pack theis so 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.349
 pack ice and found out that I am 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.060
 his tackles as a tie to normal 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.359
 ice, which always exists, however 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.890
 not okay that you ask why 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.640
 why why stay open now 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:12.060
 on the one hand we have normal here 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:14.760
 pack ice then grabs ice and then the 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.650
 fences and asthma tomb from so on 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.630
 normal ice does not connect anything 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.220
 they do not in pact specifically to 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.230
 one side could then have a page 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.519
 at 2 max, of course, both again 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:28.530
 pages and yes it is a bit there yes 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.510
 the question is probably why 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.880
 because because this pack theis again 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.620
 as a somewhat solid block is considered that 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.750
 Normally, yes, I pack that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.230
 but compressed ice is complicated 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.150
 that he is a solid block 1 yes 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.700
 no matter it is usually both times 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.900
 heart of sales is compressed or not 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 That's the question my friends 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:54.269
 Anyway, okay, who comes up with something like that 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:56.940
 next thing is from calais 99 and he 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:01.319
 If you are in the end one night 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:03.209
 Drinking everything becomes very dark okay 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.109
 actually it would have to be bright but 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.150
 I also have a go at night I turn 

00:04:06.109 --> 00:04:11.419
 yes that's a very she so yes 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:14.970
 really then gets frank se 

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:19.799
 you do not see it here 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:22.470
 totally okay to know well never 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:24.320
 Tried and it is scary than 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:27.170
 otherwise his team will be ok 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.840
 works is true 

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:32.970
 and the last thing for today is from 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:34.950
 heckroth droid and he writes if you can 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.240
 At the edge of a stage stands a zombie 1 

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.810
 He can not pursue you then 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.550
 attack 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.470
 so may over the stage or beats 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.760
 a light and he has me still video 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.410
 Game went with screenshots to be short 

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:46.230
 to hold on and see was me 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.030
 Skeptical stands here on one level 

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:52.430
 Stones labs and have up to 20 times to bbi 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.660
 and he will not attack 

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.490
 here is good founder knew from the 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.320
 level in the graphic is easy 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.720
 I would like to understand here now 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.930
 go yes there's a lot going on then he goes 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.640
 Come on 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:07.440
 otherwise I will be questioned again 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.419
 Now, now I do not think so 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.400
 ass the dogs arrive I have that 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.200
 problem with the yet had here that 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.669
 that with left was yes it 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.350
 actually works on one level 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.510
 it's working out too 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.800
 if the vicar pursued but runs 

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.090
 so here on the edge put means 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:25.410
 happy and he does not do anything 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.730
