00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
the game and I kind of travel to stay

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:06.149 
the game and I kind of travel to stay
away<00:01:03.820> from<00:01:03.880> all<00:01:04.119> that<00:01:04.299> because<00:01:04.799> it's<00:01:05.799> mostly<00:01:06.070> a

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:06.159 
away from all that because it's mostly a

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.249 
away from all that because it's mostly a

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
load of CAC and that probably won't like
