00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
this is a pocket color wheel that you

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.919 
this is a pocket color wheel that you
can<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.780> at<00:00:09.929> any<00:00:10.050> art<00:00:10.440> supply<00:00:10.800> store<00:00:11.929> you're

probably<00:00:13.110> wondering<00:00:13.530> what<00:00:13.590> I'm<00:00:13.740> doing<00:00:13.769> with

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
probably wondering what I'm doing with

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.340 
probably wondering what I'm doing with
it<00:00:14.280> well<00:00:14.549> actually<00:00:14.700> this<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> very<00:00:15.870> important

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it well actually this is very important

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.279

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
because without this you really can't

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.620 
because without this you really can't
counteract<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.609> different<00:00:21.000> colors<00:00:21.330> that<00:00:21.510> are

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
mean at every level there is something

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.400 
mean at every level there is something
called<00:00:29.310> an<00:00:29.580> undertone<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> your<00:00:30.929> hair<00:00:31.199> in

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
other words at every level if I was to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.830 
other words at every level if I was to
put<00:00:34.590> bleach<00:00:35.399> straight<00:00:36.000> on<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.300> hair<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
put bleach straight on that hair and

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.500 
put bleach straight on that hair and
lift<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.770> your<00:00:37.950> level<00:00:38.190> what<00:00:39.120> would<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.390> the

color that would be remaining in the

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.090 
color that would be remaining in the
hair<00:00:41.520> so<00:00:42.059> if<00:00:42.180> I<00:00:42.270> took<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.320> outside<00:00:43.500> color

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
hair so if I took the the outside color

apply a corrective base I color that has
a<00:01:49.200> blue<00:01:49.590> base<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> for<00:01:51.509> example<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.560> range

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
a blue base so for example in this range

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.639 
a blue base so for example in this range
I<00:01:53.250> would<00:01:53.880> choose<00:01:54.180> something<00:01:54.810> more<00:01:55.140> in<00:01:55.350> this

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
I would choose something more in this

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.090 
I would choose something more in this
well<00:01:56.310> that's<00:01:56.460> red<00:01:56.729> violet<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.380> this<00:01:58.380> ash<00:01:58.560> blue

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
well that's red violet in this ash blue

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.060 
well that's red violet in this ash blue
over<00:01:59.759> here<00:02:00.060> so<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:00.930> would<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.530> apply<00:02:01.829> like

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
over here so I would have to apply like

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.789 
over here so I would have to apply like
a<00:02:02.130> level<00:02:02.520> six<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:02.939> B<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.659> that<00:02:04.469> would

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
a level six a B and that would

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.249 
a level six a B and that would
counteract<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.640> make<00:02:06.270> her<00:02:06.450> a<00:02:06.479> nice<00:02:06.840> neutral

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
counteract and make her a nice neutral

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.530 
counteract and make her a nice neutral
6n<00:02:08.840> so<00:02:09.840> whenever<00:02:10.379> you're<00:02:10.860> applying<00:02:11.250> color

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
wheel whatever color is across from the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.750 
wheel whatever color is across from the
color<00:03:12.870> you<00:03:13.079> want<00:03:13.260> to<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.530> that's<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.549> color

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
color you want to be that's the color

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.460 
color you want to be that's the color
that's<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.180> neutralize<00:03:15.359> it<00:03:15.840> so<00:03:16.290> this

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
that's going to neutralize it so this

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.649 
that's going to neutralize it so this
yellow<00:03:16.650> orange<00:03:17.190> blue<00:03:17.790> violet<00:03:18.329> is<00:03:18.449> going<00:03:18.599> to

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
yellow orange blue violet is going to

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.210 
yellow orange blue violet is going to
neutralize<00:03:18.810> that<00:03:19.319> and<00:03:19.530> make<00:03:19.650> a<00:03:19.680> nice<00:03:19.919> brown

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
neutralize that and make a nice brown

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.819 
neutralize that and make a nice brown
base<00:03:20.549> so<00:03:21.449> you<00:03:21.810> might<00:03:22.199> want<00:03:22.379> to<00:03:22.409> pick<00:03:22.560> one<00:03:22.739> of

base so you might want to pick one of

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:23.930 
base so you might want to pick one of
these<00:03:22.919> up<00:03:22.979> if<00:03:23.310> you're<00:03:23.430> going<00:03:23.519> to<00:03:23.609> be<00:03:23.669> doing<00:03:23.819> a
