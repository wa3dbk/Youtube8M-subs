Oklahoma<00:00:25.619> City<00:00:25.830> would<00:00:26.670> be<00:00:26.789> able<00:00:26.849> to<00:00:27.060> dominate

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
Oklahoma City would be able to dominate

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.419 
Oklahoma City would be able to dominate
as<00:00:27.660> they<00:00:27.840> did<00:00:27.990> in<00:00:28.019> quarters<00:00:28.410> one<00:00:28.680> two<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.369> four

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
about field goal percentage or i should

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.450 
about field goal percentage or i should
say<00:01:30.570> opposing<00:01:31.140> field<00:01:31.350> goal<00:01:31.590> opponent<00:01:32.280> field

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
say opposing field goal opponent field

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.580 
say opposing field goal opponent field
goal<00:01:32.640> percentage<00:01:33.090> and<00:01:33.350> you<00:01:34.350> know<00:01:34.470> they

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
goal percentage and you know they

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.800 
goal percentage and you know they
allowed<00:01:34.740> about<00:01:35.369> forty<00:01:35.759> three<00:01:35.939> percent<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.540> clip

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
allowed about forty three percent a clip

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.359 
allowed about forty three percent a clip
roughly<00:01:37.350> in<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.619> name<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.220> that

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
roughly in that name in that

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.460 
roughly in that name in that
neighborhood<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:38.970> the<00:01:39.659> grizzlies<00:01:40.200> shot

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
neighborhood and the grizzlies shot

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.980 
neighborhood and the grizzlies shot
nearly<00:01:40.979> fifty<00:01:41.520> percent<00:01:41.880> in<00:01:42.119> game<00:01:42.360> two<00:01:42.630> on<00:01:42.659> the

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
nearly fifty percent in game two on the

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.600 
nearly fifty percent in game two on the
road<00:01:43.110> so<00:01:43.290> i<00:01:43.320> don't<00:01:43.560> think<00:01:43.740> that<00:01:43.890> continues<00:01:44.490> on

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
road so i don't think that continues on

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
road so i don't think that continues on
the<00:01:45.060> flip<00:01:45.329> side<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.840> grizzlies<00:01:46.229> defense

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the flip side the grizzlies defense

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.710 
the flip side the grizzlies defense
really<00:01:47.220> did<00:01:47.490> them<00:01:47.640> well<00:01:47.820> in<00:01:47.850> Game<00:01:48.180> two<00:01:48.210> but<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
really did them well in Game two but the

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.450 
really did them well in Game two but the
Thunder<00:01:49.229> are<00:01:49.409> actually<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.280> of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> better

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
Thunder are actually one of the better

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.460 
Thunder are actually one of the better
offensive<00:01:51.329> teams<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.869> league<00:01:52.020> as<00:01:52.229> well

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
offensive teams in the league as well

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.560 
offensive teams in the league as well
there's<00:01:52.979> six<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.549> field<00:01:53.820> goal<00:01:54.000> percentage

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
there's six the field goal percentage

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.930 
there's six the field goal percentage
you<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.590> around<00:01:55.890> 47

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
you know around 47

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.780 
you know around 47
one<00:01:57.180> in<00:01:57.480> game<00:01:57.960> two<00:01:58.350> they<00:01:58.590> only<00:01:58.740> shot<00:01:59.220> about

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
one in game two they only shot about

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.330 
one in game two they only shot about
thirty<00:02:00.180> nine<00:02:00.510> percent<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.500> I<00:02:01.710> think<00:02:02.190> there's

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
thirty nine percent so I think there's

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.860 
thirty nine percent so I think there's
definitely<00:02:02.400> room<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.360> crew<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.750> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
definitely room for the crew for the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.350 
definitely room for the crew for the
Thunder<00:02:04.260> to<00:02:04.530> improve<00:02:05.070> as<00:02:05.520> far<00:02:05.820> as<00:02:05.910> their<00:02:06.090> field

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
Thunder to improve as far as their field

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.359 
Thunder to improve as far as their field
goal<00:02:06.540> percentage<00:02:06.960> goes<00:02:07.170> and<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.890> improve<00:02:08.130> as

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
goal percentage goes and to improve as

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
goal percentage goes and to improve as
far<00:02:08.640> as<00:02:08.729> their<00:02:08.910> defensive<00:02:09.450> field<00:02:10.110> goal

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
far as their defensive field goal

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.550 
far as their defensive field goal
percentage<00:02:10.800> goes<00:02:11.040> as<00:02:11.790> well<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.450> I<00:02:12.900> think<00:02:13.260> those

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
percentage goes as well so I think those

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.580 
percentage goes as well so I think those
numbers<00:02:14.010> sort<00:02:14.520> of<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:15.510> migrate<00:02:16.140> back<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
numbers sort of you know migrate back to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.350 
numbers sort of you know migrate back to
the<00:02:16.710> norm<00:02:16.920> as<00:02:17.100> far<00:02:17.340> as<00:02:17.430> what<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.700> saw<00:02:17.730> from<00:02:18.180> the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
the norm as far as what we saw from the

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720 
the norm as far as what we saw from the
thunder<00:02:19.050> in<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.260> regular<00:02:19.650> season<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.190> that

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
thunder in the regular season and that

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.360 
thunder in the regular season and that
helps<00:02:21.240> them<00:02:21.300> take<00:02:22.290> care<00:02:22.590> of<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.920> Grizzlies<00:02:23.340> in

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370
