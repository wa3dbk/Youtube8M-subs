00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.690 
and I don't want that into my amazement
when<00:02:05.750> I<00:02:05.810> use<00:02:06.020> some<00:02:06.200> metal<00:02:06.530> polish<00:02:06.890> actually

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
when I use some metal polish actually

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.100 
when I use some metal polish actually
took<00:02:07.820> all<00:02:08.030> of<00:02:08.060> the<00:02:08.240> red<00:02:08.420> off<00:02:08.540> as<00:02:08.720> well

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
took all of the red off as well

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.570 
took all of the red off as well
revealing<00:02:09.410> that<00:02:09.650> it<00:02:09.770> was<00:02:09.890> white<00:02:10.100> plastic

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
revealing that it was white plastic

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.400 
revealing that it was white plastic
underneath<00:02:10.910> after<00:02:11.600> put<00:02:11.840> sticking<00:02:12.260> the

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
underneath after put sticking the

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.500 
underneath after put sticking the
template<00:02:13.100> upside<00:02:13.550> down<00:02:13.730> on<00:02:13.910> the<00:02:14.000> back<00:02:14.210> so<00:02:14.480> I

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
template upside down on the back so I

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.030 
template upside down on the back so I
wouldn't<00:02:14.780> have<00:02:14.960> to<00:02:15.140> risk<00:02:15.320> trying<00:02:15.620> to<00:02:15.710> peel<00:02:15.890> it

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
wouldn't have to risk trying to peel it

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.520 
wouldn't have to risk trying to peel it
off<00:02:16.190> afterwards<00:02:16.580> I<00:02:17.000> cut<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.780> out<00:02:17.930> roughly<00:02:18.380> on

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
off afterwards I cut it out roughly on

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.830 
off afterwards I cut it out roughly on
my<00:02:18.800> band<00:02:18.980> I<00:02:19.310> then<00:02:19.490> used<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.820> flat<00:02:20.030> file<00:02:20.330> to<00:02:20.660> make

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:20.840 
my band I then used a flat file to make

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.080 
my band I then used a flat file to make
the<00:02:21.050> neck<00:02:21.230> it's<00:02:21.650> a<00:02:21.770> holographic<00:02:22.370> point<00:02:22.910> lit

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
the neck it's a holographic point lit

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.000 
the neck it's a holographic point lit
and<00:02:23.300> then<00:02:23.660> perfected<00:02:24.170> the<00:02:24.320> raw<00:02:24.470> shape<00:02:24.740> of<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
and then perfected the raw shape of the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.370 
and then perfected the raw shape of the
curves<00:02:25.280> on<00:02:25.550> my<00:02:25.730> bandsaw<00:02:25.940> I<00:02:26.450> could<00:02:26.810> use<00:02:26.960> a<00:02:26.990> small

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
curves on my bandsaw I could use a small

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.070 
curves on my bandsaw I could use a small
diamond<00:02:27.830> file<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.490> perfect<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.240> tiny<00:02:29.600> tiny

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
diamond file to perfect this tiny tiny

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.440 
diamond file to perfect this tiny tiny
part<00:02:30.380> here<00:02:30.770> and<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.490> finish<00:02:31.850> off<00:02:32.000> the<00:02:32.180> curves

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
part here and then finish off the curves

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.230 
part here and then finish off the curves
with<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.780> front<00:02:33.140> wheel<00:02:33.350> or<00:02:33.710> Emery<00:02:34.340> fan<00:02:34.700> mounted

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
with a front wheel or Emery fan mounted

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.160 
with a front wheel or Emery fan mounted
in<00:02:35.330> my<00:02:35.360> drill<00:02:35.720> press

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
in my drill press

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.590 
in my drill press
after<00:02:36.950> removing<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.430> burrs<00:02:37.730> and<00:02:37.760> smoothing

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
after removing the burrs and smoothing

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.720 
after removing the burrs and smoothing
over<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.960> corners<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.560> decided<00:02:40.340> that<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.700> best

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
over the corners I decided that the best

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.430 
over the corners I decided that the best
way<00:02:41.090> to<00:02:41.120> apply<00:02:41.450> it<00:02:41.570> would<00:02:41.840> use<00:02:42.050> double-sided

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
way to apply it would use double-sided

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:45.070 
way to apply it would use double-sided
tape<00:02:43.040> as<00:02:43.280> it's<00:02:43.880> likely<00:02:44.180> to<00:02:44.270> get<00:02:44.510> scratched<00:02:44.840> and

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
tape as it's likely to get scratched and

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.240 
tape as it's likely to get scratched and
destroyed<00:02:45.440> because<00:02:45.800> they<00:02:45.890> have<00:02:46.010> such<00:02:46.220> a

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
destroyed because they have such a

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.700 
destroyed because they have such a
strange<00:02:46.610> scrubbing<00:02:47.120> action<00:02:47.410> what<00:02:48.410> a<00:02:48.440> great

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
strange scrubbing action what a great

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.180 
strange scrubbing action what a great
phrase<00:02:49.040> I<00:02:49.840> stuck<00:02:50.840> it<00:02:50.959> down<00:02:51.080> tightly<00:02:51.410> rubbed<00:02:52.040> it

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
phrase I stuck it down tightly rubbed it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.010 
phrase I stuck it down tightly rubbed it
in<00:02:52.370> to<00:02:52.610> remove<00:02:52.880> all<00:02:53.090> of<00:02:53.209> the<00:02:53.300> high<00:02:53.420> spots<00:02:53.750> and

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
in to remove all of the high spots and

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.800 
in to remove all of the high spots and
here<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.800> the<00:02:54.950> finished<00:02:55.280> guitar<00:02:55.640> it<00:02:56.540> looks

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
here is the finished guitar it looks

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.830 
here is the finished guitar it looks
weird<00:02:57.200> and<00:02:57.680> fuss<00:02:58.520> concludes<00:02:59.090> Jake's<00:02:59.540> weird

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
weird and fuss concludes Jake's weird
