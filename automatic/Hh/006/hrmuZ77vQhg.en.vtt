00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.550
 good 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.910
 this is the video for people who 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:15.830
 they do not believe in the toilet equipment for 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.830
 unlock your ios devices 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:21.449
 for here 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.000
 do not trust people anymore when 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.880
 they tell him about a bring a thing so 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.070
 I would say but good 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.829
 Ok let's go 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:34.839
 I need we need to buy 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.460
 but what the iphone here are the 

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:38.829
 records 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.250
 that we have worked well 

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:44.960
 we not so much because our friend in 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.809
 USA with his friend Álex 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.820
 and here we are all the files 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.940
 needed to unlock the new ones 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.820
 apple security certificates and 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.440
 each of the devices with their 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.440
 respective operating systems 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.780
 for this we will need 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:08.360
 we are going to use this 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.420
 local server but actually you 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.480
 they're just going to need an ip because 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.910
 we do not give you the files and 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.040
 you do the same we will take 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.370
 our friend Alex who does not want 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.570
 nobody took the credit and told me 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.479
 exclusively that I was not going to do it 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.120
 whatever that is, they pay him a million 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:32.990
 of dollars 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:37.030
 here is the ip that you will have another 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.030
 time when the gentleman is buying 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.690
 the store 

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.810
 these files 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:54.689
 Some 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.729
 around new files later they were 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.320
 modified yesterday when the 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:04.110
 completion of everything we needed and 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.849
 well this is the procedure more 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.200
 now let's record the video of how 

00:02:07.849 --> 00:02:12.840
 of the groups this is like a 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.150
 introduction the truth is that I find 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.160
 that people understand us when they 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.349
 they say he seems to want to be given as a gift 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.019
 everything I do not know we're still doing 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:24.420
 the bypass is going to give it something that 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.580
 everything and if it has not done and sweet if it has 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.810
 the tool but I think that about the 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.450
 advertising on the site gives you a lot 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.060
 money for it from light asia and 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.190
 while the people now that the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.349
 people use our meter will be finished 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.910
 sweet and then maybe they deliver 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:41.530
 also your tool although I do not think 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.330
 that is necessary but good 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.860
 maybe to compete against us 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.890
 that has been all 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.260
 in a moment we are going to make the video that 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:54.090
 this memory base will also follow me 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.209
 human thanks 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.920
 well let's start with the bypass what 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.920
 we have to do is enter 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.340
 we always connect the device 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.540
 only on iTunes and that will be 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:18.069
 totally unlocked 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.069
 this simple method 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:29.550
 we just need this has been us 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:33.360
 difficult because I will do my step and good 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:36.860
 is to configure the device and we have 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:36.860
 an unlocked device thanks
