00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700

years<00:02:20.950> and<00:02:21.280> like<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:21.940> many<00:02:22.090> others<00:02:22.480> this<00:02:22.840> was

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
years and like so many others this was

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.530 
years and like so many others this was
the<00:02:23.470> opportunity<00:02:23.830> she'd<00:02:24.550> been<00:02:24.730> waiting<00:02:24.880> for<00:02:25.090> I

the opportunity she'd been waiting for I

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.390

think<00:02:25.959> people<00:02:26.260> are<00:02:26.380> buying<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.070> get<00:02:27.220> whatever

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:27.400 
think people are buying to get whatever

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.130 
think people are buying to get whatever
they<00:02:27.760> can<00:02:27.820> and<00:02:28.239> if<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:28.480> can<00:02:28.660> get<00:02:28.810> into<00:02:28.959> a

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
they can and if they can get into a

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.080 
they can and if they can get into a
really<00:02:29.590> good<00:02:29.830> place<00:02:30.100> like<00:02:30.340> the<00:02:30.489> casino<00:02:30.910> then

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
really good place like the casino then

really good place like the casino then
yeah<00:02:31.480> and<00:02:32.230> I<00:02:32.320> think<00:02:32.530> it<00:02:32.650> would<00:02:32.769> be<00:02:32.950> completely

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
yeah and I think it would be completely

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.520 
yeah and I think it would be completely
worth<00:02:33.880> the<00:02:34.090> wait<00:02:34.239> because<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.230> would<00:02:35.410> be

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
worth the wait because it would be

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.350 
worth the wait because it would be
life-changing<00:02:35.880> that<00:02:36.880> would<00:02:37.060> be<00:02:37.209> able<00:02:37.269> to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
life-changing that would be able to

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.490 
life-changing that would be able to
provide<00:02:37.690> better<00:02:37.900> for<00:02:38.380> my<00:02:38.470> family
