00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
to the one to the six to the two here's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:54.799 
to the one to the six to the two here's
what<00:00:27.150> it<00:00:27.240> sounds<00:00:27.510> like<00:00:39.980> here<00:00:40.980> is<00:00:41.129> again<00:00:53.809> okay

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
what it sounds like here is again okay

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
what it sounds like here is again okay
so<00:00:55.320> we're<00:00:55.469> going<00:00:55.620> from<00:00:55.949> eclat<00:00:57.079> 72<00:00:58.079> f<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:59.329> then

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
so we're going from eclat 72 f and then

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.579 
so we're going from eclat 72 f and then
from<00:01:00.629> d<00:01:00.930> 7<00:01:01.320> over<00:01:01.559> 2<00:01:02.309> g<00:01:02.550> minor<00:01:02.870> so<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:04.229> start<00:01:04.470> out

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
from d 7 over 2 g minor so we start out

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.830 
from d 7 over 2 g minor so we start out
here<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.159> we're<00:01:05.250> actually<00:01:05.430> playing<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:06.180> bunch

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
here and we're actually playing a bunch

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.219 
here and we're actually playing a bunch
of<00:01:06.960> F<00:01:07.140> minor<00:01:07.409> 7<00:01:07.830> over<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.520> B<00:01:08.670> flat<00:01:08.850> 7<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
of F minor 7 over the B flat 7 and the

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.710 
of F minor 7 over the B flat 7 and the
reason<00:01:10.560> that<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.799> can<00:01:10.950> do<00:01:11.040> that<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.310> because

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
reason that we can do that is because

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.390 
reason that we can do that is because
we're<00:01:12.720> saying<00:01:12.990> okay<00:01:13.260> B<00:01:13.439> flat<00:01:13.619> 7<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.130> a<00:01:14.159> dominant

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
we're saying okay B flat 7 is a dominant

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.170 
we're saying okay B flat 7 is a dominant
chord<00:01:14.850> it's<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.990> five<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:17.520> flat<00:01:17.820> even

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
chord it's the five of the flat even

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.300 
chord it's the five of the flat even
though<00:01:18.390> we're<00:01:18.540> not<00:01:18.630> going<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.049> e-flat<00:01:19.159> and<00:01:20.159> in

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
though we're not going to e-flat and in

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
the key of e 5 22 is f minor 7 so f

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.380 
the key of e 5 22 is f minor 7 so f

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
play F minor 7 while the rhythm section

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.859 
play F minor 7 while the rhythm section
is<00:01:31.740> on<00:01:31.979> B<00:01:32.250> flat<00:01:32.430> 7<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> creates<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.329> suspended

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
is on B flat 7 it creates a suspended

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.870 
is on B flat 7 it creates a suspended
feeling<00:01:34.229> which<00:01:34.860> you<00:01:35.009> will<00:01:35.159> then<00:01:35.310> resolve<00:01:35.640> by

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
feeling which you will then resolve by

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.700 
feeling which you will then resolve by
playing<00:01:36.180> some<00:01:36.479> b<00:01:36.720> flat<00:01:36.840> 7<00:01:37.259> stuff<00:01:37.470> ourselves

playing some b flat 7 stuff ourselves

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.149 
playing some b flat 7 stuff ourselves
but<00:01:38.220> first<00:01:38.460> we<00:01:39.240> start<00:01:39.299> out<00:01:39.630> here<00:01:40.020> on<00:01:40.170> the<00:01:40.920> fifth

terms of b-flat 36 hammer on 2 flat 7

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.090 
terms of b-flat 36 hammer on 2 flat 7
pull<00:02:05.860> off<00:02:06.010> to<00:02:06.730> 625<00:02:09.509> flat<00:02:10.509> 3rd<00:02:10.869> slide<00:02:11.470> down<00:02:11.860> to

pull off to 625 flat 3rd slide down to

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:24.899 
pull off to 625 flat 3rd slide down to
two<00:02:12.370> and<00:02:13.030> root<00:02:13.450> of<00:02:13.780> B<00:02:14.110> flat<00:02:14.380> so<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.490> F<00:02:15.640> minor

00:02:24.899 --> 00:02:24.909 

00:02:24.909 --> 00:02:27.759 

now<00:02:25.909> we're<00:02:26.239> on<00:02:26.390> f<00:02:26.629> and<00:02:27.500> we're<00:02:27.590> gonna<00:02:27.680> play

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
now we're on f and we're gonna play

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:33.899 
now we're on f and we're gonna play
fmaj7<00:02:28.340> sounds<00:02:29.859> here's<00:02:30.859> the<00:02:31.099> 3rd<00:02:31.340> to<00:02:32.269> the<00:02:32.299> 5th

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
fmaj7 sounds here's the 3rd to the 5th

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.559 
fmaj7 sounds here's the 3rd to the 5th
67<00:02:34.909> and<00:02:35.510> now<00:02:35.750> root<00:02:36.730> major<00:02:37.730> 7<00:02:38.090> is<00:02:38.150> chromatic

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
67 and now root major 7 is chromatic

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:41.570 
67 and now root major 7 is chromatic
passing<00:02:38.719> tone<00:02:39.079> to<00:02:39.230> flat<00:02:39.530> 7

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
passing tone to flat 7

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.610 
passing tone to flat 7
so<00:02:42.150> there<00:02:42.300> we<00:02:42.390> get<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.660> dominant<00:02:43.350> seventh

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
so there we get that dominant seventh

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.680 
so there we get that dominant seventh
sign<00:02:43.740> again

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:47.690 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.860 

now<00:02:48.290> here<00:02:48.830> we<00:02:48.950> are<00:02:48.980> on<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.760> D<00:02:49.940> chord

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:02.059 

with<00:02:54.870> a<00:02:55.170> d<00:02:55.950> altered<00:02:56.519> leg<00:02:58.849> so<00:02:59.849> here's<00:03:00.629> d<00:03:01.069> here's

portable you can take each of those

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.360 
portable you can take each of those
ideas<00:04:47.270> out<00:04:47.479> and<00:04:47.630> apply<00:04:47.840> them<00:04:47.990> elsewhere
