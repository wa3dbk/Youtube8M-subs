the waterfall in the Sun that doesn't

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:48.199 
the waterfall in the Sun that doesn't
even<00:02:45.569> make<00:02:45.690> sense<00:02:46.129> so<00:02:47.129> better<00:02:47.879> for<00:02:48.000> me<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> go

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
even make sense so better for me to go

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.369 
even make sense so better for me to go
for<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.420> Earth<00:02:48.510> Day<00:02:48.660> but<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.080> have<00:02:49.230> no

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.850 
have and I'm gonna have to I was pretty
thinking<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> fusion<00:02:55.349> ball<00:02:55.590> because<00:02:55.800> I

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
thinking for the fusion ball because I

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.800 
thinking for the fusion ball because I
knew<00:02:56.010> he<00:02:56.129> would<00:02:56.250> be<00:02:56.280> the<00:02:56.489> event<00:02:56.910> Victini<00:02:57.540> that

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
knew he would be the event Victini that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.649 
knew he would be the event Victini that
came<00:02:57.989> out<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.290> while<00:02:58.409> ago<00:02:58.709> but<00:02:59.519> I<00:02:59.969> was<00:03:00.329> actually

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
came out a while ago but I was actually

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.140 
came out a while ago but I was actually
expecting<00:03:00.870> him<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.170> go<00:03:01.290> for

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
expecting him to go for

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:03.400 
expecting him to go for
which<00:03:02.240> is<00:03:02.390> why<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.569> switched<00:03:02.810> out<00:03:03.110> but<00:03:03.350> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
which is why I switched out but the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.050 
which is why I switched out but the
excellent<00:03:03.770> pervy<00:03:04.010> create<00:03:04.370> so<00:03:04.550> in<00:03:04.670> essence<00:03:04.970> I

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
excellent pervy create so in essence I

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.640 
excellent pervy create so in essence I
could<00:03:05.270> have<00:03:05.360> stayed<00:03:05.510> in<00:03:05.569> there<00:03:05.870> so<00:03:06.470> I'm<00:03:06.560> gonna

gonna go ahead set up another top layer

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.280 
gonna go ahead set up another top layer
of<00:03:55.070> toxic<00:03:55.489> spikes<00:03:55.670> and<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:56.570> just<00:03:56.750> like<00:03:56.870> Cosmo

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
of toxic spikes and I'm just like Cosmo

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.400 
of toxic spikes and I'm just like Cosmo
what<00:03:57.440> are<00:03:57.500> you<00:03:57.590> doing<00:03:58.930> he<00:03:59.930> goes<00:04:00.050> for<00:04:00.170> the<00:04:00.200> draw

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
what are you doing he goes for the draw

Peck<00:04:00.709> I'm<00:04:01.280> not<00:04:01.489> gonna<00:04:01.610> want<00:04:02.269> he<00:04:02.330> cam<00:04:02.540> from

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
Peck I'm not gonna want he cam from

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.020 
Peck I'm not gonna want he cam from
where<00:04:02.989> he<00:04:03.050> is<00:04:03.110> but<00:04:03.700> apparently<00:04:04.700> he<00:04:04.880> has<00:04:05.000> a

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
where he is but apparently he has a

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:06.670 
where he is but apparently he has a
light<00:04:05.269> form<00:04:05.510> as<00:04:05.660> well<00:04:05.840> so<00:04:06.110> that's<00:04:06.200> kinda

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
light form as well so that's kinda

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.140 
light form as well so that's kinda
stressed<00:04:07.130> is<00:04:07.310> weird<00:04:07.519> that's<00:04:07.850> just<00:04:08.030> weird

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
stressed is weird that's just weird

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.080 
stressed is weird that's just weird
cause<00:04:08.269> oh<00:04:08.620> but<00:04:09.620> I<00:04:09.650> think<00:04:10.310> that<00:04:10.579> he<00:04:10.760> has<00:04:10.940> the

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
cause oh but I think that he has the

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.729 
cause oh but I think that he has the
breakable<00:04:11.540> armor<00:04:11.810> which<00:04:11.959> raise<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:12.290> speed<00:04:12.590> if

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
breakable armor which raise the speed if

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.970 
breakable armor which raise the speed if
you<00:04:12.769> hit<00:04:13.130> him<00:04:13.160> if<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:13.970> hit<00:04:14.450> him<00:04:14.480> physically<00:04:14.980> so

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
you hit him if you hit him physically so

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.860 
you hit him if you hit him physically so
I<00:04:16.370> think<00:04:16.489> if<00:04:16.700> I<00:04:16.820> had<00:04:17.030> hit<00:04:17.209> him<00:04:17.329> physically<00:04:17.720> his

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
I think if I had hit him physically his

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.569 
I think if I had hit him physically his
speed<00:04:18.049> would<00:04:18.169> have<00:04:18.320> raised<00:04:18.530> by<00:04:18.829> one<00:04:19.040> stage<00:04:19.340> so

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
speed would have raised by one stage so

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.920 
speed would have raised by one stage so
I<00:04:19.640> actually<00:04:19.790> might<00:04:20.150> not<00:04:20.299> be<00:04:20.419> that<00:04:20.570> bad<00:04:20.720> of<00:04:20.780> a

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
I actually might not be that bad of a

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.340
