00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:07.500
 with me today I set the neg 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.540
 by playboy from the series switch ob and 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.960
 this is a set with which you can play small 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.389
 Preparing snacks can be the whole thing 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.789
 for children over three years of age 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:22.830
 hasbro and are included in the sap 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.390
 five play doh cans as well some 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.130
 shapes with which you just the snacks 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.720
 then I can advise and I will now 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.130
 Just open it and we'll see 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.529
 the whole thing more closely 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.800
 There are really many things with you 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.480
 I have now unpacked everything 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.610
 and I drive here you can as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.180
 first cut out for toast bread 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 and then there are two more and 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.110
 I suppose 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 you lose all that and then 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.910
 hereby you can the little pimples 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.890
 to cut 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:56.570
 So either a whole toast bread 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.309
 half or a quarter 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.449
 then there are lots of fruits here 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:09.590
 I have a church here once 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.590
 in red blue would be a blue 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.869
 Grapes money and that looks 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:20.680
 actually every bit of lemon 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.360
 is purple but can also be one 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.090
 one can be the color of the 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.340
 rhine power and you want and bananas 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.409
 are not actually orange that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.840
 It's just that way I think so 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:34.060
 so that you can learn the colors and 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.659
 so pay attention to it for 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:43.360
 infants around just the numbers from 1 to 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:46.869
 5 and some colors to be able to learn so 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.250
 the fruits are there and there are still 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:51.670
 an Apple 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.580
 he is even really big there you can 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.069
 do play here and then play doh 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:59.330
 squeeze and then you have one 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.580
 Apple 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.770
 hereby you can square things 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:10.360
 punch out so for example too 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:14.870
 toast bread or you can use it 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:19.040
 Biscuits make cake everything is square 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:22.850
 is and things are all round here 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:26.000
 things can roll before this 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.590
 roll out the cages here and 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.590
 You can punch that out so here 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.580
 and while you are already here 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:43.150
 punched out then you can do it with it 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:45.380
 still cut into small fifths or 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.910
 Of course, who would like to join? 

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:55.190
 make the pizza cutter then is still 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:03:00.020
 cake is so small with it 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:01.910
 lift two plates 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.800
 so you have a plate on what 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.310
 you can eat and down below the 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.959
 plates 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:08.209
 there you can make another cookie 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:12.590
 either or I think that's one of those 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:14.480
 fluted potato chips and the last 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.519
 what else is included in the set 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.959
 This is a pizza if you are 

00:03:16.519 --> 00:03:21.380
 You can see exactly here 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:25.850
 example mushrooms or so small cheese 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.560
 chunks of cheese sprinkles so you can 

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.110
 So a pizza make so synonymous first 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.910
 roll out and then punch 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.920
 Thus, there are also five play 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:37.000
 I already said cans and already 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.350
 we'll have a look again now 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.340
 once on that is a strong one 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.080
 green 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:48.360
 I can already imagine that 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:48.360
 join a vibrant green apple 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.680
 a beautiful bright yellow a banana yellow 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:02.790
 I see or perhaps to 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.790
 sandwich yellow 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.790
 Purple in the one can also beautiful Liliana 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.820
 Grapes join Neckar I think 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:17.260
 but directly on dark purple grapes 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:23.300
 and what else do I have here 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:24.830
 I think it's a bright pink there 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.320
 I could already either one 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.060
 Imagine apple or maybe so 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:33.290
 You can make small berries with it 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:35.720
 raspberries or maybe tomatoes and 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.810
 then put on the pizza 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.490
 There are really many delicious things 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:44.510
 are pink 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:46.210
 and last but not least you can do 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.870
 either on his sandwich one 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:53.360
 make cheese cream on it or you can 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:57.980
 what to do with his above 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:00.200
 until cream or something like that 

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.390
 fight me with white 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:09.280
 There are really many possibilities 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:13.100
 okay so that was the set the exit 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.570
 a really nice set I find and 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.100
 i will definitely be in there too 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.560

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.990
