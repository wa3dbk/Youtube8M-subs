improvements<00:00:02.639> today<00:00:03.389> we<00:00:03.540> can<00:00:03.659> be<00:00:03.689> plastering

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
improvements today we can be plastering

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.280 
improvements today we can be plastering
a<00:00:04.290> curved<00:00:04.650> wall<00:00:05.359> it's<00:00:06.359> quite<00:00:06.720> unique<00:00:06.930> wall

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
a curved wall it's quite unique wall

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.700 
a curved wall it's quite unique wall
because<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.859> curved<00:00:08.189> two<00:00:08.580> ways<00:00:08.760> so<00:00:09.179> it's<00:00:09.330> got

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:09.710 
because it's curved two ways so it's got

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.009 
because it's curved two ways so it's got
an<00:00:10.710> exterior<00:00:11.040> curve<00:00:11.400> there<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.030> then<00:00:12.509> here<00:00:12.780> as

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
an exterior curve there and then here as

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.010 
an exterior curve there and then here as
you<00:00:13.200> move<00:00:13.410> around<00:00:13.590> the<00:00:13.799> walls<00:00:13.980> quite<00:00:14.400> a<00:00:14.759> bit<00:00:15.020> so

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
you move around the walls quite a bit so

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.240 
you move around the walls quite a bit so
you<00:00:16.260> only<00:00:16.379> way<00:00:16.560> that<00:00:16.710> we're<00:00:16.830> going<00:00:16.949> to<00:00:17.010> be<00:00:17.100> able

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
you only way that we're going to be able

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.160 
you only way that we're going to be able
to<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.430> this<00:00:17.609> really<00:00:17.940> with<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> trowel<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
to do this really with a trowel is to

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.769 
to do this really with a trowel is to
come<00:00:19.350> across<00:00:19.619> one<00:00:19.890> way<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:21.000> can't<00:00:21.449> really<00:00:21.600> be

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
come across one way I can't really be

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:22.640 
come across one way I can't really be
going<00:00:21.930> up<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.289> down

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
going up and down

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.769 
going up and down
doesn't<00:00:23.310> really<00:00:23.369> work<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.939> couple<00:00:24.600> of<00:00:24.660> things

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
doesn't really work a couple of things

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.210 
doesn't really work a couple of things
I've<00:00:24.960> got<00:00:25.109> to<00:00:25.140> do<00:00:25.260> before<00:00:25.380> I<00:00:25.590> get<00:00:25.740> going<00:00:26.070> you

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
I've got to do before I get going you

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.189 
I've got to do before I get going you
just<00:00:26.430> put<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.880> stop<00:00:27.300> bead<00:00:27.480> along<00:00:27.689> there<00:00:27.960> and

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
just put a stop bead along there and

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
just put a stop bead along there and
some<00:00:28.650> scream<00:00:28.920> type<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.519> on<00:00:29.609> all<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.849> joints

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
some scream type and on all the joints

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.970 
some scream type and on all the joints
and<00:00:30.449> then<00:00:30.900> indeed<00:00:31.170> this<00:00:31.289> anywhere<00:00:31.710> where<00:00:31.830> it's

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
and then indeed this anywhere where it's

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.459 
and then indeed this anywhere where it's
necessary<00:00:32.540> we<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:33.690> hit<00:00:33.809> the<00:00:33.899> start<00:00:34.140> off<00:00:34.290> by

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
necessary we can hit the start off by

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.080 
necessary we can hit the start off by
doing<00:00:34.530> one<00:00:34.920> top<00:00:35.160> coat<00:00:35.430> then<00:00:35.820> I'm<00:00:35.940> going<00:00:36.059> to

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
doing one top coat then I'm going to

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.549 
doing one top coat then I'm going to
flatten<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.719> then<00:00:37.170> we're<00:00:37.260> gonna<00:00:37.350> do<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
flatten that in then we're gonna do the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.110 
flatten that in then we're gonna do the
second<00:00:38.070> coat<00:00:38.100> then<00:00:38.610> we're<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:38.910> flatten

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
second coat then we're going to flatten

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.970 
second coat then we're going to flatten
that<00:00:39.270> in<00:00:39.540> they're<00:00:40.050> not<00:00:40.079> going<00:00:40.290> to<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:40.500> too<00:00:40.710> wet

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
that in they're not going to do too wet

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.889 
that in they're not going to do too wet
trails<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.730> they're<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> go<00:00:42.570> over<00:00:42.750> with

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
trails and they're going to go over with

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.930 
trails and they're going to go over with
a<00:00:42.989> dry<00:00:43.170> trail<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.829> finish<00:00:44.129> off<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.460> so<00:00:44.879> I'll

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
a dry trail to finish off with so I'll

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.779 
a dry trail to finish off with so I'll
be<00:00:45.030> going<00:00:45.180> over<00:00:45.300> five<00:00:45.690> times<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:46.170> total<00:00:46.789> bottom

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
be going over five times in total bottom

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:48.590 
be going over five times in total bottom
that's<00:00:47.910> finished<00:00:48.239> we're<00:00:48.360> gonna<00:00:48.420> have<00:00:48.570> a

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
that's finished we're gonna have a

that's finished we're gonna have a
lovely<00:00:48.840> smooth<00:00:49.440> curved<00:00:49.980> wall

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.680 

so<00:01:46.490> just<00:01:46.729> to<00:01:46.820> reiterate<00:01:46.940> what<00:01:47.390> I<00:01:47.420> did<00:01:47.570> before

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:47.690 
so just to reiterate what I did before

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.850 
so just to reiterate what I did before
we<00:01:48.560> put<00:01:48.770> on<00:01:48.860> one<00:01:49.070> coat<00:01:49.100> one<00:01:49.640> nice<00:01:49.909> thick<00:01:50.210> coat

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
we put on one coat one nice thick coat

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.340 
we put on one coat one nice thick coat
left<00:01:51.860> it<00:01:52.010> a<00:01:52.070> little<00:01:52.100> bit

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
left it a little bit

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.080 
left it a little bit
flatten<00:01:54.350> it<00:01:54.440> off<00:01:54.619> the<00:01:55.130> record<00:01:55.250> a<00:01:55.520> second<00:01:55.909> coat

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
flatten it off the record a second coat

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.430 
flatten it off the record a second coat
to<00:01:56.119> catch<00:01:56.450> all<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.690> little<00:01:56.869> bits<00:01:56.990> that<00:01:57.350> I

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
to catch all the little bits that I

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.650 
to catch all the little bits that I
didn't<00:01:57.650> get<00:01:57.770> on<00:01:57.860> first<00:01:58.130> to<00:01:58.220> go<00:01:58.340> left<00:01:59.330> that<00:01:59.510> for

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
didn't get on first to go left that for

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.030 
didn't get on first to go left that for
a<00:01:59.690> little<00:01:59.869> while<00:01:59.990> again<00:02:00.259> just<00:02:00.830> smooth<00:02:01.009> that

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
a little while again just smooth that

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.580 
a little while again just smooth that
off<00:02:01.420> then<00:02:02.420> we're<00:02:02.540> gonna<00:02:02.660> open<00:02:02.810> up<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.080> wet<00:02:03.290> trail

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590 
off then we're gonna open up a wet trail

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.130 
off then we're gonna open up a wet trail
so<00:02:04.340> we<00:02:04.430> flip<00:02:04.640> the<00:02:04.729> water<00:02:04.880> on<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.540> we<00:02:05.780> just<00:02:05.960> want

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
so we flip the water on and we just want

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.050 
so we flip the water on and we just want
some<00:02:06.320> of<00:02:06.380> the<00:02:06.470> fat<00:02:06.680> to<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:06.890> surface<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:07.880> once

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.060 
some of the fat to the surface so once

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.110 
some of the fat to the surface so once
again<00:02:08.179> just<00:02:08.330> fill<00:02:08.660> all<00:02:08.840> the<00:02:08.990> tiny<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.619> new<00:02:09.830> bits

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:10.120 
again just fill all the tiny my new bits

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.370 
again just fill all the tiny my new bits
that<00:02:11.120> we<00:02:11.239> didn't<00:02:11.420> get<00:02:11.540> from<00:02:11.900> the<00:02:11.959> previous

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
that we didn't get from the previous

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.309 
that we didn't get from the previous
coats<00:02:12.650> we<00:02:13.520> did<00:02:13.670> that<00:02:13.819> twice<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.450> then<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.110> just

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
coats we did that twice and then I just

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.190 
coats we did that twice and then I just
finished<00:02:15.620> off<00:02:15.800> with<00:02:16.760> one<00:02:16.940> final<00:02:17.270> joint<00:02:18.020> just

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
finished off with one final joint just

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.540 
finished off with one final joint just
dried<00:02:18.440> trout<00:02:18.709> just<00:02:18.860> to<00:02:19.040> put<00:02:19.190> a<00:02:19.220> little<00:02:19.340> shine

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
dried trout just to put a little shine

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.420 
dried trout just to put a little shine
on<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.880> walls<00:02:20.470> it's<00:02:21.470> been<00:02:21.709> quite<00:02:21.980> important

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
on the walls it's been quite important

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.070 
on the walls it's been quite important
really<00:02:22.730> to<00:02:22.910> get<00:02:23.000> this<00:02:23.120> wall<00:02:23.360> absolutely

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:24.080 
really to get this wall absolutely

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.199 
really to get this wall absolutely
perfect<00:02:24.560> because<00:02:24.739> as<00:02:25.310> there's<00:02:25.610> so<00:02:25.760> much<00:02:25.910> light

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
perfect because as there's so much light

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:29.440 
perfect because as there's so much light
