probably about 12 12 millimeters long
that<00:01:19.700> side<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.979> gets<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.249> bit<00:01:22.369> dark<00:01:22.579> when<00:01:22.820> you<00:01:22.909> go

00:01:22.989 --> 00:01:22.999 
that side it gets a bit dark when you go

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:26.109 
that side it gets a bit dark when you go
around<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.240> side<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:25.340> can<00:01:25.460> see<00:01:25.520> it<00:01:25.759> travels

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
around the side you can see it travels

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.349 
around the side you can see it travels
up<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.450> side<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:28.490> above<00:01:28.700> my<00:01:28.909> screwdriver

00:01:29.349 --> 00:01:29.359 
up the side just above my screwdriver

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:32.469 
up the side just above my screwdriver
there<00:01:29.659> is<00:01:30.289> traveling<00:01:30.770> up<00:01:30.950> the<00:01:30.979> side<00:01:31.479> probably

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
there is traveling up the side probably

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.489 
there is traveling up the side probably
about<00:01:32.689> 25<00:01:33.439> millimetres<00:01:35.170> I'm<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.319> going<00:01:36.469> to

00:01:36.489 --> 00:01:36.499 
about 25 millimetres I'm just going to

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:40.000 
about 25 millimetres I'm just going to
shine<00:01:36.710> a<00:01:36.740> light<00:01:36.979> round<00:01:37.249> the<00:01:37.340> side

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.010 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.370 

there<00:01:40.850> we<00:01:40.940> go<00:01:42.430> so<00:01:43.430> you<00:01:43.490> see<00:01:43.670> that<00:01:43.790> crack<00:01:44.380> it's

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
there we go so you see that crack it's

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.260 
there we go so you see that crack it's
about<00:01:45.530> 25<00:01:46.100> millimeters<00:01:46.670> going<00:01:46.880> up<00:01:46.970> the<00:01:47.060> side

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
about 25 millimeters going up the side

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.520 
about 25 millimeters going up the side
probably<00:01:48.280> maybe<00:01:49.280> even<00:01:49.610> 15<00:01:50.000> millimeters

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
probably maybe even 15 millimeters

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:59.980 
probably maybe even 15 millimeters
underneath<00:01:58.210> so<00:01:59.210> when<00:01:59.480> they're<00:01:59.600> cracked<00:01:59.840> like

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
underneath so when they're cracked like

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.490 
underneath so when they're cracked like
that<00:02:00.260> they're<00:02:00.740> quite<00:02:00.950> obvious<00:02:01.400> to<00:02:01.430> spot<00:02:02.500> so

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
that they're quite obvious to spot so

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.120 
that they're quite obvious to spot so
locate<00:02:03.860> the<00:02:03.980> left<00:02:05.470> anti-roll<00:02:06.470> bar<00:02:06.650> bracket

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
locate the left anti-roll bar bracket

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.240 
locate the left anti-roll bar bracket
look<00:02:08.060> directly<00:02:08.330> above<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:09.290> that's<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.950> area

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
look directly above and that's the area

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.550 
look directly above and that's the area
you<00:02:10.340> need<00:02:10.460> to<00:02:10.550> be<00:02:10.640> looking<00:02:10.910> for<00:02:11.120> and<00:02:11.560> then

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
you need to be looking for and then

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.410 
you need to be looking for and then
moving<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.950> to<00:02:12.980> the<00:02:13.220> other<00:02:13.340> common<00:02:14.180> mount

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
moving on to the other common mount

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.810 
moving on to the other common mount
which<00:02:15.290> is<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.590> right<00:02:15.800> front<00:02:16.280> mount<00:02:16.520> on<00:02:16.700> the

diff carrier which is hidden by a
plastic<00:02:20.900> under<00:02:21.440> tray<00:02:21.650> so<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.310> best<00:02:22.550> thing<00:02:22.730> to

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
plastic under tray so the best thing to

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.690 
plastic under tray so the best thing to
do<00:02:22.970> is<00:02:23.870> look<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.290> in<00:02:24.410> that<00:02:24.560> hole<00:02:24.770> is<00:02:25.010> an<00:02:25.430> 8<00:02:25.520> mil

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
do is look up in that hole is an 8 mil

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.550 
do is look up in that hole is an 8 mil
self-tapping<00:02:26.210> screw<00:02:26.600> take<00:02:26.930> that<00:02:27.110> out<00:02:27.320> and

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
self-tapping screw take that out and

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
self-tapping screw take that out and
then<00:02:28.160> you've<00:02:28.280> got<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.460> little<00:02:28.640> bit<00:02:28.850> of<00:02:28.970> movement

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
then you've got a little bit of movement

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.400 
then you've got a little bit of movement
on<00:02:30.340> your<00:02:31.510> under<00:02:32.510> tray<00:02:32.690> don't<00:02:33.050> put<00:02:33.230> too<00:02:33.380> much

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
on your under tray don't put too much

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.100 
on your under tray don't put too much
but<00:02:33.950> you've<00:02:34.400> got<00:02:34.550> a<00:02:34.580> little<00:02:34.790> bit<00:02:34.910> and<00:02:35.900> then<00:02:36.020> you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
but you've got a little bit and then you

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.470 
but you've got a little bit and then you
can<00:02:36.140> locate<00:02:36.410> the<00:02:36.860> mount<00:02:37.490> that's<00:02:37.880> the<00:02:38.060> base<00:02:38.270> of

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
can locate the mount that's the base of

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.240 
can locate the mount that's the base of
the<00:02:38.570> main<00:02:38.750> where<00:02:39.740> I'm<00:02:39.830> showing<00:02:40.100> in<00:02:40.220> the<00:02:40.310> light

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
the main where I'm showing in the light

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.790 
the main where I'm showing in the light
that's<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:43.490> nut<00:02:43.730> on<00:02:44.000> the<00:02:44.840> stud<00:02:45.110> holding<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
that's the nut on the stud holding the

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.730 
that's the nut on the stud holding the
subframe<00:02:46.340> and<00:02:46.610> mount<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:48.080> that's<00:02:48.260> the<00:02:48.440> one<00:02:48.590> we

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
subframe and mount and that's the one we

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.710 
subframe and mount and that's the one we
want<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:48.920> look<00:02:49.040> at<00:02:49.190> at<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.340> very<00:02:49.370> top<00:02:49.760> up<00:02:50.000> we

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
want to look at at the very top up we

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.470 
want to look at at the very top up we
look<00:02:51.020> at<00:02:51.140> the<00:02:51.200> floor<00:02:52.000> so<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.090> best<00:02:53.240> thing<00:02:53.450> to

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
look at the floor so the best thing to

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.770 
look at the floor so the best thing to
do<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:54.370> put<00:02:55.370> a<00:02:55.400> light<00:02:55.670> or<00:02:56.300> a<00:02:56.330> torch<00:02:56.650> in<00:02:57.650> there

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
do is put a light or a torch in there

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.150 
do is put a light or a torch in there
this<00:02:59.780> one<00:02:59.989> is<00:03:00.080> a<00:03:00.110> lot<00:03:00.350> more<00:03:00.500> tricky<00:03:00.860> to<00:03:00.980> find

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
this one is a lot more tricky to find

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.770 
this one is a lot more tricky to find
because<00:03:01.580> you've<00:03:01.790> got<00:03:01.910> a<00:03:01.940> lot<00:03:02.150> of<00:03:02.180> items<00:03:02.390> in<00:03:02.720> the

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
because you've got a lot of items in the

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.390 
because you've got a lot of items in the
way<00:03:03.280> anti-roll<00:03:04.280> bar<00:03:05.260> driveshaft<00:03:06.400> lower

with me and just going to focus onto the

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.580 
with me and just going to focus onto the
floor

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.500 

and<00:03:21.130> then<00:03:21.250> move<00:03:21.430> the<00:03:21.580> handbrake<00:03:21.849> cable<00:03:22.330> down

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
and then move the handbrake cable down

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.800 
and then move the handbrake cable down
and<00:03:23.190> you<00:03:24.190> can<00:03:24.370> just<00:03:24.400> get<00:03:25.000> to<00:03:25.180> the<00:03:25.300> top<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.690> the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
and you can just get to the top of the

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.900 
and you can just get to the top of the
mount<00:03:26.280> we're<00:03:27.280> actually<00:03:27.400> looking<00:03:27.640> at<00:03:27.849> the

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
mount we're actually looking at the

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.140 
mount we're actually looking at the
floor<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.450> in<00:03:28.660> the<00:03:28.750> distance<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.230> can<00:03:29.440> see<00:03:29.680> a

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
floor and in the distance you can see a

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.510 
floor and in the distance you can see a
hairline<00:03:31.150> crack<00:03:31.209> which<00:03:31.840> is<00:03:31.870> probably<00:03:32.230> about

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
hairline crack which is probably about

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.570 
hairline crack which is probably about
10<00:03:33.520> millimeters<00:03:33.819> long<00:03:34.540> and<00:03:34.870> it's<00:03:35.500> coming<00:03:36.489> out

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
10 millimeters long and it's coming out

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.830 
10 millimeters long and it's coming out
of<00:03:36.640> the<00:03:36.849> top<00:03:37.090> of<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.239> mount<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:37.660> it's

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
of the top of the mount and it's

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.000 
of the top of the mount and it's
pointing<00:03:38.440> to<00:03:39.209> 11<00:03:40.209> 10<00:03:40.750> or<00:03:40.870> 11<00:03:41.170> o'clock<00:03:41.349> on<00:03:41.650> a<00:03:41.680> on

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
pointing to 11 10 or 11 o'clock on a on

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:45.449 
pointing to 11 10 or 11 o'clock on a on
a<00:03:42.069> clock<00:03:42.430> face<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:44.380> handbrake<00:03:44.769> cable<00:03:45.130> you<00:03:45.310> can

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
a clock face the handbrake cable you can

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.970 
a clock face the handbrake cable you can
see<00:03:45.640> in<00:03:46.150> normal<00:03:46.569> position<00:03:46.810> hides<00:03:47.349> the<00:03:47.650> top<00:03:47.860> of

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
see in normal position hides the top of

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.040 
see in normal position hides the top of
the<00:03:48.040> mount<00:03:48.250> so<00:03:49.239> you<00:03:49.330> need<00:03:49.450> to<00:03:49.510> pull<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.810> down

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
the mount so you need to pull that down

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.690 
the mount so you need to pull that down
I'm<00:03:50.349> just<00:03:50.410> going<00:03:50.709> to<00:03:50.739> try<00:03:51.130> and<00:03:51.160> see<00:03:51.400> if<00:03:51.489> I<00:03:51.550> can

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
I'm just going to try and see if I can

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:58.500 
I'm just going to try and see if I can
point<00:03:51.940> to<00:03:52.120> it<00:03:55.739> so<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:56.890> just<00:03:57.250> at<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.269> end<00:03:58.390> of

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
point to it so it's just at the end of

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.250 
point to it so it's just at the end of
my<00:03:58.600> screws<00:03:58.870> over<00:03:59.049> here<00:04:00.330> and<00:04:01.330> finishes<00:04:02.019> about

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
my screws over here and finishes about

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:04.080 
my screws over here and finishes about
there<00:04:02.500> that's<00:04:03.370> where<00:04:03.489> it<00:04:03.580> finishes<00:04:03.819> at<00:04:03.940> the

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 
there that's where it finishes at the

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.550 
there that's where it finishes at the
moment<00:04:04.360> the<00:04:04.420> actual<00:04:04.720> starting<00:04:05.140> points<00:04:05.440> of

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
moment the actual starting points of

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.150 
moment the actual starting points of
these<00:04:05.680> is<00:04:05.920> a<00:04:05.950> spot<00:04:06.280> weld<00:04:06.489> above<00:04:07.420> the<00:04:07.830> Bush<00:04:08.830> on

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
these is a spot weld above the Bush on

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.449 
these is a spot weld above the Bush on
the<00:04:09.220> floor<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:11.500> you<00:04:11.650> can't<00:04:11.860> see<00:04:12.040> that<00:04:12.069> without

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
the floor and you can't see that without

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.240 
the floor and you can't see that without
dropping<00:04:12.670> the<00:04:12.910> subframe<00:04:13.239> so<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:14.920> will<00:04:15.099> nob

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
dropping the subframe so this will nob

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.590 
dropping the subframe so this will nob
viously<00:04:15.430> will<00:04:15.610> be<00:04:15.760> cracked<00:04:16.000> more<00:04:16.269> because<00:04:16.479> it

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
viously will be cracked more because it

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.180 
viously will be cracked more because it
will<00:04:16.750> be<00:04:16.900> the<00:04:17.260> crack<00:04:17.470> will<00:04:17.650> be<00:04:17.769> starting<00:04:18.160> from

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
will be the crack will be starting from

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.090 
will be the crack will be starting from
underneath<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:18.880> bush<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.799> but<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.889> fact

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
underneath the bush and but the fact

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.170 
underneath the bush and but the fact
that<00:04:21.130> you<00:04:21.250> can<00:04:21.400> see<00:04:21.549> these<00:04:21.669> two<00:04:21.880> cracks

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
that you can see these two cracks

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.230 
that you can see these two cracks
without<00:04:23.020> even<00:04:23.470> lower<00:04:24.040> in<00:04:24.190> the<00:04:24.310> subframe<00:04:24.640> is

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
without even lower in the subframe is

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.550 
without even lower in the subframe is
obviously<00:04:25.570> an<00:04:25.690> indication<00:04:26.020> that<00:04:26.200> the<00:04:26.350> floor

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
obviously an indication that the floor

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.430 
obviously an indication that the floor
is<00:04:26.650> cracked<00:04:26.950> so<00:04:27.370> that's<00:04:28.300> how<00:04:28.510> to<00:04:28.570> check<00:04:29.410> for

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
is cracked so that's how to check for
