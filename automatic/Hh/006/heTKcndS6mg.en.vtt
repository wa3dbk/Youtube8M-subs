00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 Now let's do our saytik with you 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.040
 a little more beautiful 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.260
 namely, we will connect with you ikonochku 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.280
 for our site and so us 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.750
 need to do 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.170
 again this is service information 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.600
 so we place it in the tag even though we 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.070
 connect the icon through a special tag 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.490
 called link 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:26.910
 here he is, yes, and see here the first thing 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.910
 write such an attribute l equals and in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.779
 double quotes we write a shotkat look 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.510
 how do i write 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.820
 short to hate, that is, it is necessary to again 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.750
 letter to letter match attentive 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.660
 please be 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.000
 and a hyphen through the space we write more accurately 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.950
 Aikan that is, we indicate to the browser that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.410
 here we will connect the icon 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:50.910
 additionally we can specify three more 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.940
 like yp in which we can write them 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:01:01.079
 so then we can write 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:01:02.520
 image and my g and may differ more precisely 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.270
 smash x hyphen 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.070
 ay can ay can note that 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.960
 I automatically closed like this 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.100
 Be sure to put a closing quote 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 on all tags 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.500
 that is, do not forget it otherwise 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.950
 will not work and now the next 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.310
 attribute let's call it hf too 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.470
 words words and now let us indicate 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.780
 the image that we will use in 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.509
 as a logo and so for this 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.369
 go to daddy my site and here 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:46.610
 512 by 512 pixels size is very large 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.409
 let's connect it first and so 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.390

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.030

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:16.310
 go to the browser we will update the page and 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.709
 see that we have such 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.700
 icon see despite the fact that she is there 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.700
 very big 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.470
 we can still connect it well so 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.940
 how wrong is too much 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.890
 big size let's we now 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:31.160
 connect ikonochku less 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.709
 it weighs only 5 kilobytes 48 to 48 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.650
 pixels is her size and let's we have her 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.569

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.299
 it's called logo min everything else 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.989
