custom<00:02:08.970> guides<00:02:09.479> so<00:02:10.380> it's<00:02:10.530> just<00:02:10.710> little<00:02:10.979> loops

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
custom guides so it's just little loops

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.730 
custom guides so it's just little loops
that<00:02:11.790> they've<00:02:11.970> used<00:02:12.000> thread<00:02:12.690> to<00:02:13.020> attach<00:02:13.110> and

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
that they've used thread to attach and

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:16.760 
that they've used thread to attach and
then<00:02:13.770> they've<00:02:14.520> got<00:02:14.610> just<00:02:15.030> some<00:02:15.510> rubber<00:02:15.960> and<00:02:16.290> a

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
then they've got just some rubber and a

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.860 
then they've got just some rubber and a
very<00:02:17.040> simple<00:02:17.610> reel<00:02:17.880> so<00:02:18.300> it's<00:02:18.420> almost<00:02:18.600> like<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
very simple reel so it's almost like a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.780 
very simple reel so it's almost like a
float<00:02:19.260> reel<00:02:19.440> back<00:02:19.650> home<00:02:19.950> but<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.520> know<00:02:20.610> what

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
float reel back home but you know what

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.310 
float reel back home but you know what

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
most of it is terminal tackle and again

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.150 
most of it is terminal tackle and again
we're<00:02:27.630> using<00:02:27.660> that<00:02:28.170> this<00:02:28.530> is<00:02:28.680> even<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.100> more

reel and all they do is strip out the
line<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.900> cast<00:03:07.140> when<00:03:07.500> you<00:03:07.560> have<00:03:07.680> enough<00:03:07.890> line

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
they literally fling it out so they can

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.410 
they literally fling it out so they can
cast<00:03:10.680> about<00:03:10.920> maybe<00:03:11.250> 30<00:03:11.580> 40<00:03:11.850> feet<00:03:12.150> at<00:03:12.300> the

cast about maybe 30 40 feet at the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.509 
cast about maybe 30 40 feet at the
farthest<00:03:12.870> especially<00:03:13.830> with<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.040> long<00:03:14.220> lead

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
farthest especially with the long lead

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:16.430 
farthest especially with the long lead
and<00:03:14.790> then<00:03:15.239> when<00:03:15.330> they<00:03:15.450> get<00:03:15.570> a<00:03:15.600> fish<00:03:15.840> on<00:03:16.050> if<00:03:16.290> it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
and then when they get a fish on if it's

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:18.170 
and then when they get a fish on if it's
a<00:03:16.530> small<00:03:16.800> fish<00:03:17.040> they<00:03:17.400> just<00:03:17.430> pull<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.000> like

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
a small fish they just pull it in like

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.150 
a small fish they just pull it in like
we<00:03:18.209> would<00:03:18.510> with<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.690> fly<00:03:18.989> rod<00:03:19.230> just<00:03:19.800> pull<00:03:20.040> the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
we would with a fly rod just pull the

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.530 
we would with a fly rod just pull the
line<00:03:20.370> in<00:03:20.400> but<00:03:20.760> if<00:03:20.850> it's<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.060> bigger<00:03:21.239> one<00:03:21.450> they

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
line in but if it's a bigger one they

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.330 
line in but if it's a bigger one they
would<00:03:21.660> actually<00:03:21.989> use<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.350> reel<00:03:22.560> so<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:23.250> a

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
would actually use the reel so it's a

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.840 
would actually use the reel so it's a
very<00:03:23.550> simple<00:03:23.910> 1<00:03:24.630> to<00:03:24.750> 1<00:03:24.930> gear<00:03:25.200> ratio<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:26.700> don't

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
very simple 1 to 1 gear ratio so I don't

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.190 
very simple 1 to 1 gear ratio so I don't
know<00:03:26.910> if<00:03:26.970> I<00:03:27.030> can<00:03:27.180> slide<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.600> guy<00:03:27.780> up<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> bank

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
know if I can slide this guy up the bank
