 the sve against the team of 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.880
 German corner suggested we see each other 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.119

 just support what for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.559
 a choreography for the friday evening 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.809
 play against the team from the german corner 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.360
 that's how the moselstadion is getting 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.920
 mood on the regional league so often 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 because of the many second representation 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.230
 miss who has such fans 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:54.120
 just does not belong in league four 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 in the lineup has eintracht chef 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.390
 coach roland seitz and comparison to 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.629
 play mannheim two names for the time being 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.609
 on the one hand scrooge is sorted out 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.619
 markus fuchs replaced and the other 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.430
 thomas konrad must first go to the bank 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.100
 take a seat 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 he is represented by Fabian Zittlau 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.270
 this of course also has to be done 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.939
 Eintracht defensive a little informed 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.040
 be captain fred peters changes for 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.540
 tenths on the right side and there 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.950
 Care here was a shock 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.780
 second in the camp of sv ii 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.310
 third minute first, namely dive 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.530
 here the guests dangerous in front of the gate 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.750
 from andreas links with dimitrios 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.610
 it fell off to the left on thomas klasen 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.490
 and this pulls through the cancellation 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:34.530
 just caught off but with his 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.110
 shot only the aluminum 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 the first 20 minutes of the encounter 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.720
 Both teams neutralized each other 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.790
 the lot is marked by many 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.180
 interruptions of various small fouls 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.700
 and only a little played to the end 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.530
 combinations the 2238 spectators in the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.470
 home of harmony must be 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.270
 initially with rather meager football fare 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.789
 to be satisfied 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.380
 we jump into the thirtieth minute 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.329
 again it is burning in front of the gate of 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.820
 Lengsfeld Glasen runs into the penalty area 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.960
 one is not disturbed aggressively enough 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.360
 fits in the middle 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.219
 Dimitrios miss it you miss it 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.679
 his input but the leather is coming 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:12.410
 Alas, you alone at the long 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.660
 Post lurking but missed his shot 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.970
 the entry box clearly in luck 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.540
 this scene for the team of the porta 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.819
 nigra 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.799
 but this little luck is missing 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.799
 Team in blue black white for in 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.840
 the next scene just before break 42 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:29.480
 michael stahl is running to one 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.980
 free kick from the left can bring him though 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.620
 not from his teammates 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.090
 but just pulls off directly and 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:37.970
 there is the thing in it 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.660
 the tus from koblenz goes with 0 to 1 in 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.819
 guide 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.980
 that's what it's supposed to be from the first half 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:45.680
 could be seen presentable unfortunately 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.019
 is that the bitter at this time 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.459
 true but let's see if chef 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.680
 coach roland seitz in his 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.540
 half-time speech the right words 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.220
 for his team will be with the 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.140
 occur to his kicker before native 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.870
 The audience can visit the Upper Palatinate in the 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.760
 first 45 minutes just not 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.260
 he demanded to be satisfied 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.139
 the week still we want to go home 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:08.420
 be a power again if the sve 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:09.950
 Look back on this street 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.829
 We prefer to fast in the second part 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.780
 der rheinland pfalz derby and we go 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.670
 right in the 58 minute 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.530
 standard situation for the harmony 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.480
 steven lewerenz brings a corner of the 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.750
 right side in at the long post 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.870
 increases Fabian Zittlau highly outweighs the 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.139
 leather but his header missed that 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.319
 gate 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:32.750
 by dieter paucken two minutes later 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:35.740
 Abelski leads the ball centrally in front of the ball 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.960
 Penalty area of ​​the guests continues to lewerenz 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.270
 he just pulls off no bad 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.760
 idea on these drenched lawn yet 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.210
 His goal is no problem for him 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.430
 the man in the housing of the tus from koblenz 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.930
 just a minute on it finally seems 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.910
 the team from the roman city now 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.500
 little awakened lewerenz with one 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.610
 brings free kick from the right side 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.040
 the leather in front of the gate 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.790
 hagenburg the top scorer of sve 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.400
 go up 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:02.740
 but he is not capable of the ball 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:05.950
 dangerous enough to hit the gate 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:08.230
 70 minutes of play it would be almost there 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.810
 been at abelski goes over to the right and 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.580
 the leather flanks in the middle but there 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:14.260
 nobody comes to the ball this flies 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.540
 continue to substitute max kruse 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:17.350
 with black enough time has the ball 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.020
 to accept 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.680
 but he finds his master in dieter 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.050
 Paucken 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.610
 five minutes before the end sets again 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.770
 Teacher is beautiful on the right 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.420
 side by the man with the 7 on the 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.340
 entry jersey fits the leather in the 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:32.050
 solve the substitute bubacks 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.210
 this takes the ball to be direct 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.030
 shot goes far beyond the gate 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:39.430
 the third minute of replay time 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.310
 Now it is getting really tight 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.170
 still a big possibility for the svs 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:46.450
 Cruiser will come after a giant 

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:48.730
 messed up on the ball of the only 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.800
 from friend and foe jumps back and forth 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.110
 the substitute one pulls with the 21 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.210
 from a short distance but a gate 

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.260
 The entry today simply does not seem 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.330
 granted 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.100
 and that was really all of them 

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.660
 from the perspective of today's 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:02.740
 friday on game under floodlight against 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.730
 Rhineland Palatinate rivals 

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.550
 had been happy 

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.780
 they were bitterly disappointed with zero 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.940
 One thing must be the team of harmony 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.410
 beaten austria against koblenz 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.450
 the reparation of the defeat 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.910
 against mannheim on home turf 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.050
 she is clearly outrun kurbades 

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:18.820
 concord trier 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:20.890
 Of course we are also at the next one 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:23.620
 part of the sv again for you on the spot 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:26.340
 By the way, again a home game then against 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.000
 the team from elversberg until then 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.000
 Goodbye
