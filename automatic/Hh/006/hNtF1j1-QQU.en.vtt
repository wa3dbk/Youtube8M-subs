00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.740
 today he talked about the xbox one and the truth 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.779
 I already like leaving playstation new 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.100
 obviously if you start reading this 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.289
 neutral headquarters you're going to stay with your mouth 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.420
 open not good as the none 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.720
 comments very cagones and recontra 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.730
 cagones of each you do not have internet 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.880
 perfect I have something for you I have a 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.430
 Xbox 360 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.190
 It was what he said and you will say no mommy 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.080
 grandfather if he said it we have a product 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 for people who can not have access 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.800
 Internet no matter where you do not 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.739
 it's called xbox 360 was what he said 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.129
 and has closed internet access and is 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:04.629
 always offline at 460 was what he said 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:08.790
 this mister madrid said that xbox 1 has 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.040
 been created by gamers and for gamers 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.360
 that's why you need to be always connected 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.310
 to the internet so please 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.310
 do not judge us is what he said 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 but obviously the comment does not 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.480
 liked people for nothing because it was a 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.930
 bit offensive is not like saying is 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:34.540
 how to say no ok if you do not have xbox 1 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.270
 because it's going to bring it apart from the internet 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:39.640
 I do not have the 360 â€‹â€‹not for you since I do not 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.200

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.270
