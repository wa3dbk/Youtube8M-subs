00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
cars.com auto reviews I'm Mike Hanley with cars.com and i'm here with the 2009

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:09.599
nissan versa

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.740
it's nice on small affordable hatchback
and it offers quite a bit of interior

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.440
room considering its small exterior
footprint

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.260
let's take a look at this practical
model the front of the verses cabin is

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.039
pretty roomy it's got these nice
comfortable seats and seats include a

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.580
height adjustment which is something you
don't see in all cars in this class

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.780
material quality overall is pretty
decent also for the class though some of

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.410
the controls like these air conditioning
knobs are little low grade

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.309
overall though it's not bad one thing
I'd like to see that's not here is a

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.760
telescoping steering wheel and that's
also kind of a rarity in this class but

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.840
it would alleviate one of the issues i
found was driving it inside either had

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.960
to sit too close to the pedals have a
nice comfortable

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.820
arm lengths to the wheel or too far away
and i had to be reaching forward so

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.410
that'd be one thing and be nice to see
in this model the back to the verses

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.860
surprisingly big i'm just over six feet
tall and you can see here I have good

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.740
legroom and i set the front seat for I'd
be driving at

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.220
so that means you can have tolerance and
front back and still be comfortable

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
there's a center armrest here which is a
nice feature and the background is set

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.590
in a nice angle it doesn't recline
forward and backward like some small

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.710
hatchback seats do but the position of
it makes for good comfort overall vs

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.390
cargo area behind the back seats 17.8
cubic feet you can expand that the just

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.920
over 50 cubic feet by folding down the
back seat you can see how they go down

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.670
like that there are a couple issues
though with this Carter arrangement

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.899
first of all check out how this rear
opening just cuts in right here and that

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.250
could make it harder to load in some
wider items and also look at the back

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.340
seat when it's down it's not a
completely flat extended floor like some

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.479
of the competitors offer selected also
make it difficult to load a long item

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.259
and push it all the way in the recipe is
on a lot of fronts it offers a

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.770
comfortable driving experience good gas
mileage up to 27 miles per gallon in the

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.820
city and 33 on the highway and plenty of
room inside for passengers

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.899
what's makes it even more attractive
though is it starting price of about

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.899
thirteen thousand dollars

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.420
