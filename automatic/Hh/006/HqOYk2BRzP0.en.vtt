to<00:04:37.030> keep<00:04:37.120> your<00:04:37.330> leader<00:04:37.539> safe<00:04:37.930> at<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:38.830> same

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:38.860 
to keep your leader safe at the same

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.200 
to keep your leader safe at the same
time<00:04:39.250> you<00:04:39.370> have<00:04:39.460> to<00:04:39.550> be<00:04:39.640> careful<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.150> have

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
time you have to be careful you have

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.300 
time you have to be careful you have
these<00:04:40.570> really<00:04:40.870> big<00:04:41.080> guys<00:04:41.289> in<00:04:41.530> the<00:04:41.590> board<00:04:41.800> but

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
these really big guys in the board but

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.110 
these really big guys in the board but
you<00:04:42.340> need<00:04:42.550> to<00:04:42.610> make<00:04:42.729> sure<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.000> have

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:43.120 
you need to make sure you have

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:44.370 
you need to make sure you have
territories<00:04:43.630> that<00:04:43.750> can<00:04:43.870> support<00:04:44.200> them

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
territories that can support them

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.480 
territories that can support them
because<00:04:44.680> if<00:04:44.770> someone<00:04:45.010> cuts<00:04:45.220> up<00:04:45.340> your

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:45.490 
because if someone cuts up your

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.490 
because if someone cuts up your
territory<00:04:45.910> then<00:04:46.510> you'll<00:04:46.720> lose<00:04:46.960> that<00:04:47.020> person

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
territory then you'll lose that person

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.890 
territory then you'll lose that person
and<00:04:48.460> that's<00:04:48.850> the<00:04:49.120> way<00:04:49.240> the<00:04:49.390> game<00:04:49.510> works

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
and that's the way the game works

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:52.560 
and that's the way the game works
you<00:04:50.050> check<00:04:50.289> support<00:04:50.770> check<00:04:51.130> plagues<00:04:51.550> take<00:04:52.419> it

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
you check support check plagues take it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.240 
you check support check plagues take it
action<00:04:52.900> and<00:04:53.050> then<00:04:53.140> move<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:53.680> keep<00:04:53.830> doing<00:04:54.010> it

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
action and then move and keep doing it

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.920 
action and then move and keep doing it
so<00:04:54.280> someone<00:04:54.700> has<00:04:54.850> all<00:04:55.030> the<00:04:55.180> monuments<00:04:55.660> or

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
so someone has all the monuments or

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.630 
so someone has all the monuments or
until<00:04:56.620> you've<00:04:56.710> eliminated<00:04:56.919> all<00:04:57.340> the<00:04:57.400> other

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
until you've eliminated all the other

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.779 
until you've eliminated all the other
players<00:04:57.940> now<00:04:58.510> I<00:04:58.539> think<00:04:59.190> that<00:05:00.190> there<00:05:00.370> are<00:05:00.550> going

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789

and all that sounds kind of neat but in
reality<00:05:25.330> it<00:05:26.020> just<00:05:26.530> isn't<00:05:27.070> very<00:05:27.100> interesting

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
reality it just isn't very interesting

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.210 
reality it just isn't very interesting
yeah<00:05:27.850> I<00:05:27.880> can<00:05:28.570> see<00:05:28.720> the<00:05:28.870> tension<00:05:29.350> of<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.560> okay<00:05:30.190> I

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
yeah I can see the tension of the okay I

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.500 
yeah I can see the tension of the okay I
want<00:05:30.430> to<00:05:30.490> add<00:05:30.580> this<00:05:30.760> piece<00:05:31.000> and<00:05:31.240> add<00:05:31.360> that

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
want to add this piece and add that

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.850 
want to add this piece and add that
piece<00:05:31.750> and<00:05:31.960> I'm<00:05:32.020> gonna<00:05:32.110> go<00:05:32.289> this<00:05:32.409> direction

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:32.860 
piece and I'm gonna go this direction

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.460 
piece and I'm gonna go this direction
but<00:05:32.979> if<00:05:33.070> I<00:05:33.130> go<00:05:33.280> over<00:05:33.310> here<00:05:33.490> they<00:05:34.120> might

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
but if I go over here they might

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.020 
but if I go over here they might
here<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:34.890> cut<00:05:35.010> my<00:05:35.130> kingdom<00:05:35.370> in<00:05:35.520> half<00:05:35.730> and

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
here and cut my kingdom in half and

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.390 
here and cut my kingdom in half and
there's<00:05:36.450> a<00:05:36.570> little<00:05:36.720> bit<00:05:36.930> of<00:05:37.050> that<00:05:37.230> but<00:05:37.890> I<00:05:37.950> just

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:38.400 
there's a little bit of that but I just

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.740 
there's a little bit of that but I just
don't<00:05:38.580> see<00:05:38.760> that<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.150> that's<00:05:39.270> a<00:05:39.420> very<00:05:39.630> big

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 
don't see that that that's a very big

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:41.870 
don't see that that that's a very big
audience<00:05:40.260> and<00:05:40.530> most<00:05:40.740> of<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.070> people<00:05:41.370> well<00:05:41.850> I

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:41.880 
audience and most of the people well I

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.280 
audience and most of the people well I
actually<00:05:42.270> I've<00:05:42.480> played<00:05:42.690> it<00:05:42.750> with<00:05:42.870> anybody<00:05:43.050> who

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
actually I've played it with anybody who

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.720 
actually I've played it with anybody who
likes<00:05:43.530> it<00:05:43.650> but<00:05:43.770> I'm<00:05:43.860> sure<00:05:44.070> they're<00:05:44.280> out<00:05:44.430> there

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
likes it but I'm sure they're out there

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:49.010 
likes it but I'm sure they're out there
and<00:05:45.230> I<00:05:46.230> I<00:05:46.620> think<00:05:47.490> the<00:05:47.640> games<00:05:47.970> look<00:05:48.450> doesn't

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:49.020 
and I I think the games look doesn't

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:51.410 
and I I think the games look doesn't
help<00:05:49.200> either<00:05:49.500> the<00:05:49.920> box<00:05:50.160> covers<00:05:50.610> okay<00:05:51.000> but<00:05:51.300> the

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
help either the box covers okay but the

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:53.870 
help either the box covers okay but the
game<00:05:51.630> itself<00:05:51.810> the<00:05:52.500> the<00:05:52.770> artwork<00:05:53.280> is<00:05:53.430> nice<00:05:53.670> for

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:53.880 
game itself the the artwork is nice for

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.000 
game itself the the artwork is nice for
these<00:05:53.970> but<00:05:54.180> it's<00:05:54.300> small<00:05:54.750> the<00:05:55.080> board<00:05:55.380> itself<00:05:55.710> is

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:56.010 
these but it's small the board itself is

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.640 
these but it's small the board itself is
bland<00:05:56.400> it's<00:05:57.300> just<00:05:57.480> a<00:05:57.570> blop<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.230> red<00:05:58.440> yellow

00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:58.650 
bland it's just a blop of red yellow

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:01.130 
bland it's just a blop of red yellow
blue<00:05:59.040> and<00:05:59.070> purple<00:05:59.520> and<00:05:59.850> hammers<00:06:00.630> on<00:06:00.780> the<00:06:00.900> point

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:01.140 
blue and purple and hammers on the point

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:03.860 
blue and purple and hammers on the point
that<00:06:01.320> this<00:06:01.500> is<00:06:01.560> an<00:06:02.130> abstract<00:06:02.760> game<00:06:03.030> we<00:06:03.480> got<00:06:03.690> it

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
that this is an abstract game we got it

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.720 
that this is an abstract game we got it
okay<00:06:04.200> it's<00:06:04.350> an<00:06:04.440> abstract<00:06:04.860> game<00:06:05.070> but<00:06:05.610> then

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
okay it's an abstract game but then

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.280 
okay it's an abstract game but then
you're<00:06:05.880> always<00:06:06.060> having<00:06:06.390> to<00:06:06.600> check<00:06:06.930> and<00:06:07.260> see

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:07.290 
you're always having to check and see

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:08.810 
you're always having to check and see
what<00:06:07.530> the<00:06:07.560> special<00:06:07.980> abilities<00:06:08.400> for<00:06:08.580> different

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
what the special abilities for different

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.940 
what the special abilities for different
people<00:06:08.970> are<00:06:09.330> and<00:06:09.660> you<00:06:09.690> finally<00:06:10.560> get<00:06:10.740> someone

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 
people are and you finally get someone

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:12.770 
people are and you finally get someone
cool<00:06:11.280> and<00:06:11.550> there's<00:06:11.730> their<00:06:12.060> support<00:06:12.570> swipe

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
cool and there's their support swipe

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.840 
cool and there's their support swipe
down<00:06:13.050> and<00:06:13.290> that<00:06:14.100> kind<00:06:14.400> of<00:06:14.460> leads<00:06:14.610> me<00:06:14.670> to<00:06:14.820> a

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
down and that kind of leads me to a

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:18.320 
down and that kind of leads me to a
point<00:06:15.060> of<00:06:15.270> I<00:06:15.860> believe<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:17.190> game<00:06:17.460> is<00:06:17.730> not<00:06:17.970> so

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
point of I believe the game is not so

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.180 
point of I believe the game is not so
fun<00:06:18.870> when<00:06:19.200> you're<00:06:19.320> constantly<00:06:19.710> just<00:06:19.950> feeling

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
fun when you're constantly just feeling

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:22.040 
fun when you're constantly just feeling
like<00:06:20.310> you're<00:06:20.460> constantly<00:06:20.820> coming<00:06:21.180> back<00:06:21.390> from

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:22.050 
like you're constantly coming back from

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:24.230 
like you're constantly coming back from
behind<00:06:22.290> and<00:06:22.770> once<00:06:22.950> one<00:06:23.160> player<00:06:23.430> gets<00:06:23.700> ahead<00:06:24.030> by

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
behind and once one player gets ahead by

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.870 
behind and once one player gets ahead by
a<00:06:24.270> pretty<00:06:24.630> large<00:06:24.900> margin<00:06:25.500> it's<00:06:26.130> difficult<00:06:26.760> to

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
a pretty large margin it's difficult to

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:28.940 
a pretty large margin it's difficult to
take<00:06:27.000> them<00:06:27.210> out<00:06:27.360> and<00:06:27.600> yes<00:06:28.140> I'm<00:06:28.440> sure<00:06:28.470> that<00:06:28.680> it's

00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:28.950 
take them out and yes I'm sure that it's

00:06:28.950 --> 00:06:30.890 
take them out and yes I'm sure that it's
possible<00:06:29.430> person<00:06:29.880> who's<00:06:30.120> gonna<00:06:30.270> email<00:06:30.630> me<00:06:30.840> and

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:30.900 
possible person who's gonna email me and

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:32.210 
possible person who's gonna email me and
tell<00:06:30.990> me<00:06:31.169> that<00:06:31.290> even<00:06:31.680> when<00:06:31.860> they're<00:06:31.980> about<00:06:32.100> to

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:32.220 
tell me that even when they're about to

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.220 
tell me that even when they're about to
be<00:06:32.310> defeated<00:06:32.520> they<00:06:32.730> can<00:06:32.880> take<00:06:33.030> me<00:06:33.180> out<00:06:33.210> you<00:06:34.020> are

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
be defeated they can take me out you are

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:36.710 
be defeated they can take me out you are
smarter<00:06:34.830> than<00:06:34.950> I<00:06:35.070> am<00:06:35.100> I'm<00:06:35.490> sure<00:06:35.790> but<00:06:36.540> I<00:06:36.600> don't

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:36.720 
smarter than I am I'm sure but I don't

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:37.850 
smarter than I am I'm sure but I don't
think<00:06:37.110> I<00:06:37.290> can<00:06:37.500> do<00:06:37.680> it

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:37.860 
think I can do it

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:43.040 
think I can do it
so<00:06:38.310> it's<00:06:38.460> a<00:06:38.490> very<00:06:38.669> difficult<00:06:39.030> process<00:06:39.919> so<00:06:42.050> III

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
so it's a very difficult process so III

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:44.960 
so it's a very difficult process so III
don't<00:06:43.470> think<00:06:43.770> the<00:06:43.860> game<00:06:44.070> is<00:06:44.220> a<00:06:44.340> bad<00:06:44.669> one<00:06:44.940> I

00:06:44.960 --> 00:06:44.970 
don't think the game is a bad one I

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.760 
don't think the game is a bad one I
think<00:06:45.120> that<00:06:45.390> there's<00:06:45.750> a<00:06:45.810> group<00:06:46.260> of<00:06:46.350> people<00:06:46.500> who

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
think that there's a group of people who

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.969 
think that there's a group of people who
will<00:06:46.890> enjoy<00:06:47.220> it<00:06:47.370> and<00:06:47.550> it<00:06:47.640> it<00:06:48.300> does<00:06:48.660> have<00:06:48.990> a

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:49.979 
will enjoy it and it it does have a

00:06:49.979 --> 00:06:51.920 
will enjoy it and it it does have a
handle<00:06:50.310> to<00:06:50.520> people<00:06:50.910> well<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.419> for<00:06:51.600> people<00:06:51.780> a

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:51.930 
handle to people well and for people a

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:53.780 
handle to people well and for people a
little<00:06:52.050> bit<00:06:52.169> more<00:06:52.229> chaotic<00:06:52.530> and<00:06:52.979> it<00:06:53.640> in

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:53.790 
little bit more chaotic and it in

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.909 
little bit more chaotic and it in
there's<00:06:54.030> a<00:06:54.120> level<00:06:54.510> of<00:06:54.630> tension<00:06:55.169> there<00:06:55.380> but<00:06:55.740> I

00:06:55.909 --> 00:06:55.919 
there's a level of tension there but I

00:06:55.919 --> 00:06:58.280 
there's a level of tension there but I
just<00:06:56.280> never<00:06:56.520> was<00:06:56.850> really<00:06:57.240> that<00:06:57.510> involved<00:06:58.169> with

00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:58.290 
just never was really that involved with
