00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.819 

this<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.420> a<00:00:33.450> prototype<00:00:33.840> electric<00:00:34.469> sports<00:00:34.680> car

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
this is a prototype electric sports car

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.959 
this is a prototype electric sports car
it<00:00:35.489> does<00:00:35.790> 0<00:00:36.239> to<00:00:36.300> 60<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.100> 3.7<00:00:38.100> seconds<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.820> does

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
it does 0 to 60 and 3.7 seconds it does

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.450 
it does 0 to 60 and 3.7 seconds it does
0<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.239> 100<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:39.960> 6.8<00:00:40.530> how's<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
0 to 100 and about 6.8 how's that

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.970 
0 to 100 and about 6.8 how's that
compare<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> do<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.149> Ferrari<00:00:42.540> Lamborghini<00:00:43.500> or

is not a big number but the point is
it'll<00:02:06.580> do<00:02:06.700> that<00:02:06.880> from<00:02:07.330> zero<00:02:07.540> to<00:02:07.600> 110<00:02:08.140> miles<00:02:08.320> an

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:08.440 
it'll do that from zero to 110 miles an

it'll do that from zero to 110 miles an
hour<00:02:08.560> in<00:02:08.679> one<00:02:08.800> gear<00:02:09.040> but<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.580> second<00:02:09.880> thing<00:02:09.970> is

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
hour in one gear but the second thing is

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.820 
hour in one gear but the second thing is
it's<00:02:10.270> a<00:02:10.330> very<00:02:10.480> light<00:02:10.660> car<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.470> whole<00:02:11.590> cast

does<00:02:19.000> at<00:02:19.150> the<00:02:19.330> equivalent<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.660> 170<00:02:20.260> miles<00:02:20.440> per

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
does at the equivalent of 170 miles per

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.530 
does at the equivalent of 170 miles per
gallon<00:02:20.800> and<00:02:21.550> yet<00:02:21.670> it's<00:02:21.790> faster<00:02:22.150> than<00:02:22.239> anything

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
gallon and yet it's faster than anything

Porsche<00:02:22.810> or<00:02:22.870> Ferrari<00:02:22.959> make<00:02:23.470> so<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.310> power<00:02:24.520> the

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
Porsche or Ferrari make so the power the

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.190 
Porsche or Ferrari make so the power the
performance<00:02:25.330> doesn't<00:02:25.510> cost<00:02:25.840> you<00:02:26.050> any

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
performance doesn't cost you any

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.449 
performance doesn't cost you any
efficiency<00:02:26.680> it<00:02:26.800> doesn't<00:02:27.070> cost<00:02:27.190> you<00:02:27.310> much

00:02:27.449 --> 00:02:27.459 
efficiency it doesn't cost you much

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.100 
efficiency it doesn't cost you much
weight<00:02:27.670> either<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.570> you<00:02:28.660> might<00:02:28.750> as<00:02:28.840> well<00:02:28.900> do<00:02:29.080> it

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
weight either so you might as well do it

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:30.840 
weight either so you might as well do it
right<00:02:29.350> because<00:02:29.920> people<00:02:30.280> like<00:02:30.430> performance

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
right because people like performance

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:40.400 
right because people like performance
they<00:02:30.970> pay<00:02:31.120> for<00:02:31.150> that

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.870 

the<00:02:41.410> cool<00:02:41.620> thing<00:02:41.650> about<00:02:41.890> this<00:02:42.370> car<00:02:42.430> is<00:02:42.670> that

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
the cool thing about this car is that

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.850 
the cool thing about this car is that
it's<00:02:43.480> as<00:02:43.600> quick<00:02:43.810> as<00:02:43.960> a<00:02:44.050> good<00:02:44.200> race<00:02:44.380> car<00:02:44.410> but

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
it's as quick as a good race car but

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:46.200 
it's as quick as a good race car but
it's<00:02:44.980> very<00:02:45.070> pleasant<00:02:45.340> to<00:02:45.550> drive<00:02:45.700> around<00:02:45.940> town

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
it's very pleasant to drive around town

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:48.510 
it's very pleasant to drive around town
yeah<00:02:47.110> i<00:02:47.260> think<00:02:47.350> is<00:02:47.560> a<00:02:47.620> beer<00:02:47.860> a<00:02:47.920> race<00:02:48.130> car<00:02:48.340> right

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
yeah i think is a beer a race car right

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.730 
yeah i think is a beer a race car right
now<00:02:48.550> it<00:02:49.120> basically<00:02:49.330> be<00:02:49.660> vibrating<00:02:50.230> constantly

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
now it basically be vibrating constantly

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:52.560 
now it basically be vibrating constantly
yeah<00:02:51.100> it's<00:02:51.250> noisy<00:02:51.400> they're<00:02:51.850> hard<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.090> drive<00:02:52.330> of

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
yeah it's noisy they're hard to drive of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.750 
yeah it's noisy they're hard to drive of
this<00:02:52.660> sort<00:02:52.840> of<00:02:52.990> application<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.490> of<00:02:54.580> course

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
this sort of application and of course

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.090 
this sort of application and of course
they're<00:02:54.880> very<00:02:55.030> thirsty<00:02:55.450> but<00:02:56.170> right<00:02:56.680> now<00:02:56.740> we're

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
they're very thirsty but right now we're

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.410 
they're very thirsty but right now we're
doing<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.400> equivalent<00:02:57.880> of<00:02:57.970> better<00:02:58.240> than<00:02:58.360> a

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
doing the equivalent of better than a

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.150 
doing the equivalent of better than a
hundred<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.750> fifty<00:02:58.990> miles<00:02:59.170> per<00:02:59.320> gallon<00:02:59.500> what

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
hundred and fifty miles per gallon what

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.710 
hundred and fifty miles per gallon what
can<00:03:00.310> it<00:03:00.400> means<00:03:00.580> it's<00:03:00.760> an<00:03:00.850> electric<00:03:01.270> car<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.570> lot

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
can it means it's an electric car a lot

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.770 
can it means it's an electric car a lot
less<00:03:01.960> or<00:03:02.230> very<00:03:02.890> much<00:03:03.040> less<00:03:03.390> this<00:03:04.390> car<00:03:04.660> is

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
less or very much less this car is

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.290 
less or very much less this car is
basically<00:03:04.960> tires<00:03:05.520> so<00:03:06.520> then<00:03:06.790> five<00:03:07.060> and<00:03:07.240> a<00:03:07.270> half

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.300 
basically tires so then five and a half

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.180 
basically tires so then five and a half
thousand<00:03:07.810> miles<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.200> this<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.560> 40th<00:03:08.950> time

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
thousand miles so this is the 40th time

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.580 
thousand miles so this is the 40th time
it<00:03:09.940> feels<00:03:10.120> different<00:03:10.390> than<00:03:10.660> AG<00:03:10.780> a<00:03:10.930> sports<00:03:11.320> car

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
it feels different than AG a sports car

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:13.800 
it feels different than AG a sports car
you<00:03:11.860> have<00:03:12.160> that<00:03:12.310> working<00:03:12.790> and<00:03:13.420> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.690> be
