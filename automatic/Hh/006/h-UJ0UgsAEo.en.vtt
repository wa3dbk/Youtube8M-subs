00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
don't think we got him

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:08.559 
don't think we got him
that<00:02:03.070> was<00:02:03.250> a<00:02:03.280> fish

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.899 

baits<00:02:09.259> still<00:02:09.409> on<00:02:09.709> there<00:02:10.009> but<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.489> speed<00:02:10.700> could

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
baits still on there but the speed could

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:19.550 
baits still on there but the speed could
see<00:02:11.120> it<00:02:11.239> when<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> jumped<00:02:11.810> out<00:02:11.900> of<00:02:11.959> the<00:02:12.170> water

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:33.010 

that's<00:02:20.160> where<00:02:20.430> we<00:02:20.550> were<00:02:20.819> aimed<00:02:21.060> at<00:02:21.270> for

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.990 

we're<00:02:33.590> just<00:02:33.770> checking<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.340> pool<00:02:34.580> by<00:02:34.940> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
we're just checking the pool by the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.350 
we're just checking the pool by the
rocks<00:02:35.390> here<00:02:36.340> because<00:02:37.340> it's<00:02:37.550> sheltered<00:02:38.120> but

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
rocks here because it's sheltered but

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:50.550 
rocks here because it's sheltered but
it's<00:02:38.540> being<00:02:38.900> fed

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.780 

I<00:02:50.850> can<00:02:51.850> see<00:02:52.000> throat<00:02:52.360> addicting

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:05.630 

all<00:02:58.360> right<00:02:58.510> we<00:02:58.599> got<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> bring<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.110> home

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.100 

now<00:03:06.150> we're<00:03:06.300> going<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> check<00:03:06.690> our<00:03:06.870> bait

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
now we're going to check our bait

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.870 
now we're going to check our bait
because<00:03:07.380> with<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:07.890> current<00:03:08.250> like<00:03:08.400> that<00:03:08.640> it's

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
because with the current like that it's

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:19.770 
because with the current like that it's
possible<00:03:09.540> for<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.810> day<00:03:09.960> to<00:03:10.020> come<00:03:10.320> off

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:19.780 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.930 

we<00:03:20.200> might<00:03:20.410> have<00:03:20.590> to<00:03:20.770> put<00:03:20.950> more<00:03:21.190> bait<00:03:21.430> on<00:03:21.640> just

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
we might have to put more bait on just

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:28.160 
we might have to put more bait on just
have<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.180> bigger<00:03:22.480> target

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.949 

well<00:03:28.790> bad<00:03:29.790> cast<00:03:30.230> but<00:03:31.230> can<00:03:31.530> you<00:03:31.650> see<00:03:31.830> it<00:03:31.920> there

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
well bad cast but can you see it there

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.440 
well bad cast but can you see it there
let's<00:03:33.959> see<00:03:34.110> where<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.380> goes<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:35.130> bail<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.370> open

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.860 

we'll<00:03:40.050> close<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.560> bail<00:03:41.060> and<00:03:42.060> pull<00:03:42.420> on<00:03:42.599> it<00:03:42.780> a

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
we'll close the bail and pull on it a

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.309 
we'll close the bail and pull on it a
little<00:03:43.080> bit<00:03:44.480> where's<00:03:45.480> our<00:03:45.690> line

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
little bit where's our line

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.030 
little bit where's our line
o<00:03:46.349> our<00:03:47.220> line<00:03:47.489> is<00:03:47.730> down<00:03:47.940> there<00:03:48.470> that<00:03:49.470> was<00:03:49.650> a<00:03:49.709> bad

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.040 
o our line is down there that was a bad

00:03:50.040 --> 00:04:00.280 
o our line is down there that was a bad
strategy<00:03:50.430> oh<00:03:54.080> oh<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.739> was<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:58.950> bad<00:03:59.220> strategy

hang on

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.920 
hang on
but<00:04:03.610> the<00:04:03.730> Stig's<00:04:03.970> gonna<00:04:04.180> try<00:04:04.450> to<00:04:04.510> recover

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
but the Stig's gonna try to recover

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.160 
but the Stig's gonna try to recover
there<00:04:05.319> we<00:04:05.470> go<00:04:06.450> see<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.600> line<00:04:07.810> was<00:04:08.020> in<00:04:08.140> the

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
there we go see the line was in the

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.059 
there we go see the line was in the
water<00:04:08.410> and<00:04:08.590> it<00:04:08.680> got<00:04:08.830> swept<00:04:10.350> down<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.380> cascade

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069 
water and it got swept down a cascade

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.330 
water and it got swept down a cascade
over<00:04:12.370> there<00:04:13.350> all<00:04:14.350> right<00:04:14.500> now<00:04:14.709> the<00:04:14.770> line<00:04:15.130> is

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
over there all right now the line is

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.200 
over there all right now the line is
going<00:04:15.550> out<00:04:15.790> straight<00:04:16.590> we'll<00:04:17.590> open<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:18.010> bail

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:21.210 

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.140 

floats<00:04:22.210> under<00:04:22.630> the<00:04:22.750> water<00:04:22.990> for<00:04:23.320> some<00:04:23.500> reason
