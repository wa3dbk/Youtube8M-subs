00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.209
 We are very happy with textbook previously written scientific work 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:18.640
 can you briefly explain what a prescientific work is the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.919
 Encouraging children to eat something could have escaped important 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:25.410
 Scientific explains that he has no papers in doing so enters a thick folder 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.470
 this is his 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.730
 first very small play 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.779
 First of all, they learn scientific thinking from Aiptek 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:35.010
 To distinguish Stanka it is so far that a story time happens 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.360
 that they could learn to formulate Jette questions tens of thousands followed 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.530
 jean-pierre petit a research trip 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:41.739
 our country of St 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.730
 a very precise flank for January 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.690
 Departures rush to the drum in which is now nearly five percent I find 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.790
 That's a very essential skills deeds were told by 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.730
 Surrounded by a flood of information, this was almost a lot more popular Â» 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.940
 is able to comment 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.930
 to produce constant arrival 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.969
 and discreet many tilt a good climbing tower 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.900
 and poor text ads led the students to trust land in the 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.420
 you look 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.470
 and theater projects had to be towed 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.170
 where do teachers find information about caring for a prescientific 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.790
 Work on the official website of the Federal Ministry under 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.110
 means - VW from under Tel 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.830
 There are many that the formation will take 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:24.840
 where to look for limits legal framework but also already 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.090
 little to the content conditions 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.110
 and I also tried one in the textbook and served too 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.810
 the rain will be cleared 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.420
 To sketch Nis long dreamed can be clarified 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.700
 what could be the first steps for teachers while looking at the above 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.909
 to accept this written work, they could be the first step 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.790
 to deal with their own scientific history and 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 coordinated with what is learned after 3 5 Riesch 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 what can you clear deadlines 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.740
 The second step can be through Matt Real, for example, through the 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 Book or at least there are many results for scientific work 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.840
 30 x Lion to read and look what gives them the essential part Dieckmann 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 and the third step can show that needs to become head of department 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.470
 excellent and less excellent freighters work children in school 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.909
 have been written and then mastered plays master 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.150
 Wimmer, especially if you have not cared for something like that 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.059
 said Kamp will restructure 

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:19.299
 and to the loophole three keywords 

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:21.849
 that characterize the fire department from their point of view 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.430
 the first stronger one is that artificial competence orientation 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:27.249
 Competences are women 

00:02:27.249 --> 00:02:31.129
 all students he knows a great deal competence is for me 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.639
 know second order so a mountain temporal like to structure knowledge 

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:37.939
 the second important strengthening up to me the research question the chopsticks 

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.100
 pull away from the scientification work but that does not work 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.880
 Well criticized, however, then I have actually already half 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.550
 Rent recorded and third defeat that you can manage this project 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.320
 thinks it is a big challenge to secure 16 17 18 year olds 

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.089
 Projects Gusto to divide a long period of time 

00:02:55.089 --> 00:02:58.089
 and then it makes no sense the district court has proven to live 

00:02:59.339 --> 00:03:02.809
 that is new in school I think that is a challenge but also for 

00:03:02.809 --> 00:03:03.479
 this concert
