00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
and just got some gameplay here of it

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.040 
and just got some gameplay here of it
what<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.329> looks<00:01:00.480> like<00:01:00.570> when<00:01:00.690> your<00:01:00.809> guns

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
what it looks like when your guns

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.900 
what it looks like when your guns
because<00:01:01.649> that's<00:01:02.010> probably<00:01:02.370> one<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:02.640> best

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
because that's probably one the best

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.250 
because that's probably one the best
part<00:01:03.120> of<00:01:03.180> it<00:01:03.270> especially<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.750> assault<00:01:04.049> shield

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
part of it especially the assault shield

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.469 
part of it especially the assault shield
you'll<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.280> that<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> assault<00:01:05.880> shield<00:01:05.939> it

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you'll see that the assault shield it

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.060 
you'll see that the assault shield it
actually<00:01:06.540> has<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> emblem<00:01:07.619> right<00:01:07.770> in<00:01:07.920> front

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
actually has the emblem right in front

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.500 
actually has the emblem right in front
of<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> gun<00:01:08.340> which<00:01:08.520> looks<00:01:08.729> really<00:01:08.909> cool<00:01:09.270> so

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
of the gun which looks really cool so

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.140 
of the gun which looks really cool so
yeah<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.740> i<00:01:11.189> think<00:01:11.369> is<00:01:11.490> pretty<00:01:11.640> funny<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.060> be

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
yeah it i think is pretty funny to be

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.760 
yeah it i think is pretty funny to be
able<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.330> around<00:01:12.510> people<00:01:12.990> with<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.500> dry<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
able to around people with the dry and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.109 
able to around people with the dry and
emblem<00:01:14.070> on<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> front<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.549> your<00:01:14.610> sort<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:14.970> shop

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
emblem on the front of your sort of shop

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.340 
emblem on the front of your sort of shop
I<00:01:15.150> think<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.390> have<00:01:15.479> to<00:01:15.570> prestige<00:01:15.869> it<00:01:16.049> once

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
I think you have to prestige it once

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.280 
I think you have to prestige it once
though<00:01:16.710> or<00:01:17.009> twice<00:01:17.340> yeah<00:01:17.700> twice<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.659> yeah<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
though or twice yeah twice so yeah I

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.179 
though or twice yeah twice so yeah I
guess<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.770> have<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.950> riot<00:01:20.130> shield

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
guess if you have the riot shield

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.249 
guess if you have the riot shield
prestige<00:01:21.000> twice<00:01:21.570> then<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.840> can<00:01:22.080> have<00:01:22.200> your

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
prestige twice then you can have your

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:23.240 
prestige twice then you can have your
