00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.660
 I really did not even know what to do. 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.039
 pen and paper thinking about you 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.830
 so much to describe the feeling 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.859
 so wanting everything I do involves 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.869
 But how do you say what I feel is 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:28.320
 same time someone else is feeling 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:32.510
 just as in note I see myself do different from 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.510
 every smile of yours feels like it is 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.079
 but you do not know me all day 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:45.339
 hear your voice 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:48.610
 to every music focus brasÃ­lia gama 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:51.879
 I'm going to write a letter saying that 

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.360
 matter say that I hear the voice and 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:58.659
 smile is silence arises inadvertently 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.149
 each word each sentence ends with your 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.610
 name is you 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.700
 I hope that law is something simple but it's everything 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.700
 to me that's me in this fan letter 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.659
 already at midnight I do not know what to do 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.460
 pen and paper thinking about you so much 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.219
 thing to write a feeling without 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.950
 to want everything I do involves you 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:31.709
 more like saying that the indexes to the same 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.229
 time another person is feeling the same and 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:39.289
 note I see you do differently every 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.289
 smile of yours and feel like you're mine 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.820
 but you do not know me everyday 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:51.229
 I want to hear your voice 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:54.229
 every song photo phrase earns me more 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.840
 I'll write a letter saying everything 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:00.020
 It's important to say that I'm not 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:04.160
 Your smile, Nelson, menezes today without 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:06.830
 want each word each phase ends the 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.320
 your name is you 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.830
 I hope that law is something simple but it's everything 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.290
 For me, I am in this letter that 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.290
 letter to say everything that matters in 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:22.940
 to say that I am not your lord daniel 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:26.959
 signs today without wanting every word every 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.720
 phrase ends, your name is you 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:34.510
 I hope it's easy, but it's all for 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.510
 I'm in that fan letter 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:40.049
