00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
 anatomy of the locomotor apparatus osso et moi 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.160
 de los boine a very particular bone 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.820
 as a small part contributes 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.529
 to the formation of the skull base 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:19.260
 but it is also very articulate with all the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.660
 massive facial and plus the 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.130
 our complex to see since it is for 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 get to have a good view 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.210
 we have to demolish a large part of everything 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.210
 the facial massif 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:39.719
 as you can see and it's not even a 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.329
 bone simple to describe as 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 despite being small enough 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.500
 presents a whole series of holes e 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.079
 it happens inside 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.980
 but let's look at it in more detail 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.690
 Here you can observe the mode alone 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 released from all other bones of the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.699
 skull looks like a pretty shape 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.080
 irregular is actually simple to 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:06.030
 describe if it splits it in the face 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.810
 upper face shows up in this 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.790
 way 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
 we observe a very thin sheet 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.750
 said to the pink cribb mina it presents 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.210
 a series of microscopic holes in 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.920
 guides run the nerve bundles 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.229
 olfactory 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.960
 I remember this is the roof of the 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.270
 nasal cavity 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.549
 this the mine therefore represents a 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.670
 thin demarcation layer between the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.860
 the nasal cavity the intracranial cavity to 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.930
 center is a crest called 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.930
 christa galli also 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.420
 if the lateral portion of the is observed 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:47.530
 upper face you can see some 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.810
 these cells will be incomplete cells 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.520
 then closed by the cells of the incised rhythm 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.790
 and from the frontal bone as we have 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:59.470
 seen in the previous video 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.870
 if we look at the bone et moi de dal 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.820
 in front we can see this structure 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.730
 vertical call to the mine 

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:09.310
 perpendicular to the perpendicular lamina 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.820
 pro through the bottom and will go to 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.500
 articulate with the vomer the bone of the 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.630
 massive facial that will serve for 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.630
 divide the internal nasal cavities 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.220
 finally it can be observed as fashions 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.770
 present two lateral masses or labyrinths 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.690
 et moi from there the reason why these 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.410
 structures are called mazes is 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:34.300
 clear if you select the bone you can 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.990
 in fact, note how their interior is 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.600
 consisting of numerous structures 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.989
 from the bombastic form they communicate 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.959
 all between them and also communicate with 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:49.120
 the orbit and with the nasal cavity 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:53.950
 it is precisely once again of 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:57.190
 paranasal sinuses in the complex i 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.640
 labyrinths et moi dal and have a shape a 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.550
 parallelepiped with longitudinal axis 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.150
 the greater their external face 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:09.430
 has a hooked structure at the bottom 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.920
 known as the uncinate process of the etm 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:18.100
 oid is instead the largest structure 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:21.070
 laminate the side wall takes the 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.600
 name of lamina papi racea for his 

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.610
 subtlety through which in 

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.980
 backlight cells can be observed 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.230
 that there are inside and will contribute to 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.350
 form the medial wall of the orbit 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:36.100
 the front and back faces of the 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.820
 maze it modal are rather flat 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.410
 and they have some bases that are 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.580
 due to the ampoules contained in them 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.440
 indoor 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:47.440
 but what is really interesting is the 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.300
 medial face than you can 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:51.920
 imagine contributing to form the 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:54.590
 lateral wall of the nasal cavities 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.810
 so let's observe it by sectioning 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.770
 the bone et moi of so you can 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.770
 bring more to the surface 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:11.720
 here as you can see we have the lamina 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:16.910
 perpendicular going to eliminate it 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:21.769
 we are in front of the structure 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:24.979
 medial of the labyrinths et moi from there as 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.750
 you can see the medial face of the 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:29.660
 labyrinths tmo italy presents 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:32.600
 upper and lower nasal horns 

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:35.240
 these croissants are medium nasal horn 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.810
 will have the function of dividing the 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:42.650
 nasal cavity in different parts in order 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.600
 to increase the epithelial surface to the 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.389
 below the upper nasal cornet 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:52.550
 there will be a hole called precisely 

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:54.860
 blessed superior the superior meatus 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:56.450
 receives the outlet of the tmo cells and from there 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.390
 superior and of the cells present 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.000
 inside the spheroid bone instead of the 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:06.190
 underneath the croissant you can best 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:08.270
 observe the average meatus which is 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:12.550
 corresponds to the exit hole of the 

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:15.229
 bubble et moi dal and on the lateral band 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.270
 orbital at the interface with the front 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:20.510
 two holes and video will be formed 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:22.070
 front and rear thanks to which 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:24.470
 the cells can communicate with 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:26.270
 orbit and thanks which will be offered 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.750
 passage from some vascular structures 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:32.990
 and the scepter is nervous and is therefore one 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:35.539
 show very small but at the same time very 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.600
 complex and very important from the point 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:40.940
 functional view 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.760
