WrestleMania<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:44.340> I<00:01:44.610> would<00:01:45.180> just<00:01:45.210> take<00:01:45.479> this

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
WrestleMania so I would just take this

WrestleMania so I would just take this
with<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:45.810> grain<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:46.079> salt<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.680> because<00:01:46.860> I

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
with a grain of salt right now because I

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.420 
with a grain of salt right now because I
know<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.450> WWE<00:01:49.020> fully<00:01:49.259> is<00:01:49.530> aware<00:01:49.860> that<00:01:50.280> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
know that WWE fully is aware that the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.460 
know that WWE fully is aware that the
WWE<00:01:50.759> fans<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.420> see<00:01:51.479> reigns<00:01:51.810> versus<00:01:52.439> Brock

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
WWE fans want to see reigns versus Brock

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.230 
WWE fans want to see reigns versus Brock
Lesnar<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.250> in<00:01:53.369> order<00:01:53.640> for<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.820> match<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
Lesnar but in order for this match to

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.690 
Lesnar but in order for this match to
occur<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.630> think<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.990> WWE<00:01:55.619> is<00:01:55.799> having<00:01:56.490> reigned

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
occur I think that WWE is having reigned

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.280 
occur I think that WWE is having reigned
you're<00:01:56.969> and<00:01:57.090> going<00:01:57.360> through<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.659> motions<00:01:57.689> you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
you're and going through the motions you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.670 
you're and going through the motions you
know<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.579> we<00:01:59.700> can<00:01:59.850> go<00:01:59.969> fully<00:02:00.390> on<00:02:00.659> babyface<00:02:01.439> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
know so we can go fully on babyface and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.770 
know so we can go fully on babyface and
then<00:02:02.070> it<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.460> healed<00:02:02.850> Lesnar<00:02:03.299> versus<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
then it can be healed Lesnar versus a

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.190 
then it can be healed Lesnar versus a
face<00:02:04.110> Randy<00:02:05.009> Orton<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:05.939> think<00:02:06.210> or<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:06.659> Brock

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
face Randy Orton and I think or in Brock

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.719 
face Randy Orton and I think or in Brock
Lesnar<00:02:07.469> would<00:02:07.530> put<00:02:07.710> on<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> hell<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.550> match

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
Lesnar would put on a hell of a match

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.130 
Lesnar would put on a hell of a match
but<00:02:09.179> you<00:02:09.239> know<00:02:09.330> what<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.660> was<00:02:09.840> thinking<00:02:10.050> about

but you know what I was thinking about

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.449

Cena and Lesnar all came up in the same

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.700 
Cena and Lesnar all came up in the same
year<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:15.970> WWE<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.840> the<00:02:17.170> old<00:02:17.290> made<00:02:17.500> their

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
WWE World Heavyweight title at

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.280 
WWE World Heavyweight title at
WrestleMania<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.270> that<00:02:28.600> would<00:02:29.110> be<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
WrestleMania I think that would be the

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.650 
WrestleMania I think that would be the
match<00:02:29.710> that<00:02:30.160> would<00:02:30.310> be<00:02:30.490> selling<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.390> would

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
match that would be selling that would

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.080 
match that would be selling that would
be<00:02:31.840> an<00:02:32.190> awesome<00:02:33.190> match<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.640> way<00:02:33.760> you<00:02:33.820> take

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
be an awesome match that way you take

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.820 
be an awesome match that way you take
care<00:02:34.270> of<00:02:34.360> Orton<00:02:34.660> and<00:02:34.750> Cena<00:02:34.960> and<00:02:35.230> then<00:02:35.530> you<00:02:35.620> take

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
care of Orton and Cena and then you take

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.290 
care of Orton and Cena and then you take
care<00:02:36.010> of<00:02:36.130> the<00:02:36.250> dream<00:02:36.490> match<00:02:36.640> between<00:02:36.820> or<00:02:37.120> in

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
care of the dream match between or in

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.630 
care of the dream match between or in
Lesnar<00:02:37.690> and<00:02:37.840> then<00:02:38.140> Lesnar<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.190> Cena<00:02:39.370> can

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
Lesnar and then Lesnar and Cena can

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:41.280 
Lesnar and then Lesnar and Cena can
settle<00:02:39.940> their<00:02:40.060> differences<00:02:40.300> all<00:02:40.690> in<00:02:41.110> one

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
settle their differences all in one

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.320 
settle their differences all in one
match<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:41.890> think<00:02:42.400> it<00:02:42.490> makes<00:02:42.640> sense<00:02:42.760> from<00:02:43.209> a

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330
