00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.820 
kind of overdue for a DLC for quite some
time<00:02:27.790> so<00:02:28.720> I<00:02:28.989> mean<00:02:29.230> this<00:02:29.410> is<00:02:29.500> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.739> be<00:02:29.799> a

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
time so I mean this is going to be a

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.710 
time so I mean this is going to be a
really<00:02:30.010> big<00:02:30.190> blow<00:02:30.459> for<00:02:30.489> GTA<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.239> it<00:02:31.390> does<00:02:31.569> in

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
really big blow for GTA if it does in

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
fact happen and hopefully it isn't for

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:35.610 
fact happen and hopefully it isn't for
too<00:02:34.510> long<00:02:34.750> maybe<00:02:35.019> it's<00:02:35.230> just<00:02:35.290> a<00:02:35.440> temporary

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
too long maybe it's just a temporary

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.199 
too long maybe it's just a temporary

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
just crazy to me how how these guys are

00:02:58.329 --> 00:02:59.250 
just crazy to me how how these guys are
going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.510> be<00:02:58.599> doing<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:58.900> it's<00:02:59.079> pretty

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
going to be doing this it's pretty

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.140 
going to be doing this it's pretty
awesome<00:02:59.410> though<00:02:59.650> I<00:02:59.769> don't<00:03:00.129> know<00:03:00.310> I<00:03:00.340> you<00:03:01.060> know

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
awesome though I don't know I you know

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.330 
awesome though I don't know I you know
it's<00:03:01.599> unfortunate<00:03:01.959> but<00:03:02.739> at<00:03:02.829> the<00:03:02.890> same<00:03:03.069> time<00:03:03.280> I

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
it's unfortunate but at the same time I

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:04.710 
it's unfortunate but at the same time I
guess<00:03:03.670> you<00:03:03.849> know<00:03:03.970> you<00:03:04.060> can't<00:03:04.420> really<00:03:04.540> do

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
guess you know you can't really do

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.789 
guess you know you can't really do
anything<00:03:04.930> about<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.260> but<00:03:05.410> kind<00:03:05.590> of<00:03:05.650> hoping

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
anything about it but kind of hoping

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:06.990 
anything about it but kind of hoping
that<00:03:05.920> doesn't<00:03:06.069> really<00:03:06.370> affect<00:03:06.730> you<00:03:06.819> that<00:03:06.850> much

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
that doesn't really affect you that much

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.210 
that doesn't really affect you that much
so<00:03:07.480> this<00:03:07.660> is<00:03:07.780> what<00:03:07.959> they<00:03:08.139> said<00:03:08.170> tweet<00:03:09.040> from
