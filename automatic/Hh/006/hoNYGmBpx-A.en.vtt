strategy<00:00:33.720> driving<00:00:34.590> now<00:00:34.770> well<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.280> is<00:00:35.399> the

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
strategy driving now well what is the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.310 
strategy driving now well what is the
what<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.120> strategy<00:00:36.329> for<00:00:36.720> Apple<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.200> this

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
what is the strategy for Apple for this

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.319 
what is the strategy for Apple for this
new<00:00:37.559> event<00:00:37.890> they<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.220> any<00:00:38.579> time<00:00:38.820> Apple<00:00:39.180> has

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
new event they have any time Apple has

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.090 
new event they have any time Apple has
any<00:00:39.510> type<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.719> an<00:00:39.870> announcement<00:00:40.410> event<00:00:40.680> or<00:00:40.980> any

any type of an announcement event or any

any type of an announcement event or any
event<00:00:41.430> period<00:00:41.670> coming<00:00:42.329> up<00:00:42.570> there's<00:00:42.750> all<00:00:42.930> sorts

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
event period coming up there's all sorts

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.600

of<00:00:43.530> conjecture<00:00:44.010> about<00:00:44.070> what's<00:00:44.340> going<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.520> be

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
of conjecture about what's going to be

of conjecture about what's going to be
said<00:00:44.640> they<00:00:44.940> got<00:00:45.090> one<00:00:45.210> on<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.329> first<00:00:45.630> year<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
said they got one on the first year of

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.139 
said they got one on the first year of
timber<00:00:46.200> don't<00:00:46.379> they<00:00:46.530> yep<00:00:47.250> they<00:00:47.460> do<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:48.000> uh

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
timber don't they yep they do it's uh

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.389 
timber don't they yep they do it's uh
you<00:00:48.600> know<00:00:48.690> it's<00:00:48.870> their<00:00:49.079> annual<00:00:49.500> music<00:00:49.980> focused

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
you know it's their annual music focused

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.940 
you know it's their annual music focused
event<00:00:50.670> they<00:00:50.940> in<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> fall<00:00:52.140> you<00:00:52.469> know<00:00:52.800> they've

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
event they in the fall you know they've

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.260 
event they in the fall you know they've
kind<00:00:53.129> of<00:00:53.160> rewritten<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.700> rules<00:00:53.730> a<00:00:54.030> little<00:00:54.149> bit

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
kind of rewritten the rules a little bit

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.750 
kind of rewritten the rules a little bit
about<00:00:54.690> when<00:00:55.110> products<00:00:55.559> are<00:00:55.680> launched<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
about when products are launched and you

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.060 
about when products are launched and you
know<00:00:56.910> that<00:00:57.660> the<00:00:57.840> trade<00:00:58.110> show<00:00:58.140> circuit<00:00:58.739> versus

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
know that the trade show circuit versus

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.830 
know that the trade show circuit versus
them<00:00:59.219> doing<00:00:59.430> their<00:00:59.520> own<00:00:59.579> events<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.600> fall

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
them doing their own events so the fall

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.029 
them doing their own events so the fall
event<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> September<00:01:01.680> event<00:01:01.920> has

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
event the September event has

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:03.619 
event the September event has
traditionally<00:01:02.489> become<00:01:02.730> about<00:01:02.910> music<00:01:03.390> which

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
traditionally become about music which

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.679 
traditionally become about music which
means<00:01:03.930> new<00:01:04.769> ipods<00:01:05.280> perhaps<00:01:06.149> in<00:01:06.299> addition<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
means new ipods perhaps in addition to

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.109 
means new ipods perhaps in addition to
other<00:01:06.810> things<00:01:07.139> so<00:01:07.799> kind<00:01:08.249> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.429> latest<00:01:08.850> on

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
other things so kind of the latest on

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.349 
other things so kind of the latest on
that<00:01:09.179> is<00:01:09.659> a<00:01:09.990> new<00:01:10.139> ipod<00:01:10.529> touch<00:01:10.999> that<00:01:11.999> will

00:01:12.349 --> 00:01:12.359 
that is a new ipod touch that will

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:15.019 
that is a new ipod touch that will
probably<00:01:13.109> be<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:14.100> know<00:01:14.159> have<00:01:14.310> an<00:01:14.429> industrial

00:01:15.019 --> 00:01:15.029 
probably be you know have an industrial

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:16.789 
probably be you know have an industrial
redesign<00:01:15.539> to<00:01:15.899> make<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.139> look<00:01:16.289> more<00:01:16.350> like<00:01:16.649> the

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
redesign to make it look more like the

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.609 
redesign to make it look more like the
new<00:01:16.889> iphone<00:01:17.279> 4<00:01:18.079> possibly<00:01:19.079> have<00:01:19.229> that<00:01:19.409> new

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
new iphone 4 possibly have that new

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.760 
new iphone 4 possibly have that new
super<00:01:20.099> high<00:01:20.249> res<00:01:20.490> display<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.539> then<00:01:22.079> i'll

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
super high res display and then i'll

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.649 
super high res display and then i'll
give<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.069> the<00:01:23.159> biggest<00:01:23.310> feature<00:01:23.609> will<00:01:23.939> be<00:01:24.119> at

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
give you the biggest feature will be at

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.499 
give you the biggest feature will be at
least<00:01:24.899> one<00:01:25.229> if<00:01:25.499> not<00:01:25.529> two<00:01:25.679> cameras<00:01:26.459> so<00:01:27.090> that

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
least one if not two cameras so that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.559 
least one if not two cameras so that
ipod<00:01:28.319> touch<00:01:28.590> users<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:29.399> do<00:01:29.609> the<00:01:30.119> apple

00:01:30.559 --> 00:01:30.569 
ipod touch users can do the apple

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
just too slow I actually think the

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.500 
just too slow I actually think the
software<00:05:36.010> is<00:05:36.100> pretty<00:05:36.310> neat<00:05:36.550> the<00:05:37.030> web<00:05:37.270> browser

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:37.510 
software is pretty neat the web browser

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.050 
software is pretty neat the web browser
finally<00:05:38.169> is<00:05:38.260> up<00:05:38.410> to<00:05:38.560> modern<00:05:38.710> standards<00:05:38.979> but<00:05:39.940> it

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.060 
finally is up to modern standards but it

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.350 
finally is up to modern standards but it
lags<00:05:40.330> when<00:05:40.900> you<00:05:41.530> use<00:05:41.740> it<00:05:41.770> just<00:05:42.310> your<00:05:42.729> you<00:05:43.210> do

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
lags when you use it just your you do

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.670 
lags when you use it just your you do
stuff<00:05:43.600> and<00:05:43.780> then<00:05:43.900> you're<00:05:43.990> waiting<00:05:44.350> for<00:05:44.470> it<00:05:44.560> to

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
stuff and then you're waiting for it to

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.620 
stuff and then you're waiting for it to
respond<00:05:45.130> when<00:05:45.850> it<00:05:45.940> works<00:05:46.090> it<00:05:46.390> works<00:05:46.450> pretty

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
respond when it works it works pretty

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.140 
respond when it works it works pretty
well<00:05:46.750> but<00:05:46.900> it's<00:05:47.200> just<00:05:47.410> it's<00:05:48.010> slow<00:05:48.340> and<00:05:48.370> and

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150
