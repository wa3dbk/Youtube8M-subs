one goal maybe you can improve on that
this<00:05:19.780> season<00:05:20.139> I<00:05:20.199> believe<00:05:20.530> he's<00:05:20.680> made<00:05:20.860> his

00:05:20.969 --> 00:05:20.979 
this season I believe he's made his

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:22.200 
this season I believe he's made his
england<00:05:21.070> debut<00:05:21.280> so<00:05:21.699> i<00:05:21.760> don't<00:05:21.940> think<00:05:22.120> he's

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
england debut so i don't think he's

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.089 
england debut so i don't think he's
going<00:05:22.330> to<00:05:22.389> be<00:05:22.479> losing<00:05:23.199> his<00:05:23.440> spotless<00:05:23.919> they

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:24.099 
going to be losing his spotless they

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.950 
going to be losing his spotless they
sign<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.340> few<00:05:24.580> decent<00:05:24.940> central<00:05:25.599> fielders

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:25.960 
sign a few decent central fielders

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.230
