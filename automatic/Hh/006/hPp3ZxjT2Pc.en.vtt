00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.840
 in the field of cakes by seducing samara 

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.700
 how fast was it taken 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.469
 decision to unexpected she for you 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.780
 it turned out and how it happened 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.240
 Well, it's impossible to happen unexpectedly of course 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.180
 this unexpected, too, I was waiting for this day 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.190
 Of course, this return has been waiting for a long time. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.270
 dreamed about it and it happened I 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.860
 very happy how it happened with who you 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:30.750
 invited it to work again itself 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.160
 goji husband loving called this 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.500
 decided to work here on 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.880
 called you can see 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.950
 wanted something worked in this 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.570
 coaching staff me course hall 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.310
 becomes 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.670
 what are your most vivid memories 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.989
 maybe about the previous period of work here or 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.630
 maybe game years 

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:54.820
 brightest of all in memory and of course 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.710
 wins and wins which is 0 but if on 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.050
 zero and the goalkeeper is really doubly 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.059
 victory is a victory and it is on but it 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.970
 double goalkeeper I think that's what 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.869
 bright moments so as not to highlight this game 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:10.270
 played by the team anyway 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.950
 follow and constantly watch football 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.630
 Championship Russia naturally for 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.630
 a team of wings of advice and for sure 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.770
 despite the fact that today is the first day 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.350
 have a good idea of those 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.930
 sales that there is a team that can 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.090
 say about the goalkeeper line well I want 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.030
 say she decently looks serious 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.800
 Sergey Veremko at a very good level 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.430
 felt 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.780
 well good good goalkeeper himself 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:38.580
 it means but you can see that they worked with them 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:43.370
 good specialists this is the Pushkin theo and 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:47.900
 gauss here i think i just 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.190
 must extend their work that is to 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.000
 they also performed well 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.900
 mile and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.030
 helping out the team showed high 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:00.380
 Goalkeeper class I think that everything 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.970
 well last year experienced a lot 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.530
 I know Sergey himself for not 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.690
 managed to play a long time at zero and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.200
 finally gotta take in last 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.670
 match before a long break you already 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.740
 somehow talked maybe 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.560
 individually with the guys here on this topic 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.840
 psychologically how comfortable yourself 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.410
 Feels and Sergei and other goalkeepers in 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.230
 team 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:23.720
 I think that this is it so there is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.620
 such a thing is she still david david to 0 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.260
 play but once it happened I think it 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.770
 beginning I think I already told him this 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.370
 earring 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.960
 Begin to eat, I will go further with 0 and we will 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.319
 hope we will believe it 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:41.140
 work and prepare for this 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.139
 Well, except for Sergei Veremko in part 2 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.870
 Samara goalkeeper which is very important in 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:48.700
 principle for calle advice so your 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.499
 pupils of Samara football were in 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.340
 team where the bottom Vavilin and young 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:54.370
 Alexey Fedorov 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.250
 well here's denis vavilin atari same experienced 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.430
 how do you rate his willingness yes that is 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.409
 we can say that this is the goalkeeper level 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.849
 the main composition I am ready to compete 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.099
 for this place in the main lineup and 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:07.780
 perspectives of Aleksei Fedorov who 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:08.260
 after all after all votar youthful 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.780
 national team 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.010
 but Denis mobile know for a long time with him 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.620
 worked before and what to say about 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.989
 and readiness we are all hard to say 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.049
 why because I haven't seen the guys yet 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.840
 this is most likely I will have an opinion 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.989
 after the first collection until this moment 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.239
 given moment of time and willingness then 

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:37.269
 what guys yes promising young yes i 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.469
 Well, I do not know, let's see, we'll see now 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.530
 it's hard for me to say 

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:43.180
 denis played little honey for me too 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.879
 traced veremko 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.479
 Is there a representation of this in the game as 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:52.439
 he is training in life i think that 

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:52.439
 we will work more well
