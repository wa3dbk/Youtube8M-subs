the steering rack and krausmeyer have to

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.230 
the steering rack and krausmeyer have to
be<00:01:38.470> in<00:01:38.530> the<00:01:38.620> correct<00:01:38.890> height<00:01:39.340> so<00:01:39.940> that<00:01:40.120> it

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:40.240 
be in the correct height so that it

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.350 
be in the correct height so that it
lines<00:01:40.420> up<00:01:40.660> correctly<00:01:40.720> with<00:01:41.350> the<00:01:42.360> steering

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
lines up correctly with the steering

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.400 
lines up correctly with the steering
arms<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.740> spindles<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.720> also<00:01:46.900> have<00:01:47.260> the

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
arms on the spindles we also have the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.580 
arms on the spindles we also have the
height<00:01:47.619> of<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.510> toe<00:01:49.510> strap<00:01:49.900> and<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.170> correct

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:52.380 
height of the toe strap and in correct
location<00:01:51.220> so<00:01:51.340> that<00:01:51.430> we<00:01:51.610> can<00:01:51.760> pull<00:01:51.940> the<00:01:52.060> car<00:01:52.270> and

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
location so that we can pull the car and

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.120 
location so that we can pull the car and
pull<00:01:52.570> the<00:01:52.720> car<00:01:52.960> and<00:01:53.200> pull<00:01:53.560> it<00:01:53.710> up<00:01:53.800> into<00:01:54.040> the

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
pull the car and pull it up into the

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.620 
pull the car and pull it up into the
trailer<00:01:54.550> it's<00:01:54.729> always<00:01:54.940> a<00:01:54.970> good<00:01:55.060> idea<00:01:55.180> to<00:01:55.420> add

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
trailer it's always a good idea to add

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.850 
trailer it's always a good idea to add
that<00:01:55.810> on<00:01:55.990> before<00:01:56.350> you<00:01:56.410> put<00:01:56.560> the<00:01:56.680> final

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:56.860 
that on before you put the final

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.590 
that on before you put the final
assembly<00:01:57.310> you're<00:01:57.580> doing<00:01:57.790> this<00:01:57.940> well<00:01:58.150> also

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:58.600 
assembly you're doing this well also

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.100 
assembly you're doing this well also
have<00:01:59.020> to<00:01:59.140> make<00:01:59.320> sure<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.830> the<00:02:00.720> rack<00:02:01.720> is<00:02:01.930> in

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
have to make sure that the rack is in

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.690 
have to make sure that the rack is in
the<00:02:02.200> proper<00:02:02.560> location<00:02:03.100> so<00:02:03.310> that<00:02:03.430> it<00:02:03.550> clears

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
the proper location so that it clears

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.389 
the proper location so that it clears
the<00:02:04.680> harmonic<00:02:05.680> balancer<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.600> oil<00:02:07.780> pan

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
the harmonic balancer and the oil pan

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.949 
the harmonic balancer and the oil pan
it's<00:02:09.399> not<00:02:09.610> you're<00:02:10.119> gonna<00:02:10.209> have<00:02:10.300> to<00:02:10.570> do<00:02:10.750> some

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
it's not you're gonna have to do some

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:12.720 
it's not you're gonna have to do some
major<00:02:11.140> reconstruction<00:02:11.920> work<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.430> that<00:02:12.640> and

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
major reconstruction work on that and

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.310 
major reconstruction work on that and
then<00:02:12.850> all<00:02:13.000> your<00:02:13.150> geometry<00:02:13.390> and<00:02:13.870> a<00:02:13.959> cure<00:02:14.140> meant

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
then all your geometry and a cure meant

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.920 
then all your geometry and a cure meant
will<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.500> incorrect<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.330> there<00:02:16.480> has<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.690> be<00:02:16.900> a

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
will be incorrect so there has to be a

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.449 
will be incorrect so there has to be a
lot<00:02:17.110> of<00:02:17.140> work<00:02:17.350> that<00:02:17.380> has<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.860> go<00:02:18.010> on<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.130> we

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
lot of work that has to go on that we

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.610 
lot of work that has to go on that we
also<00:02:18.580> incorporated<00:02:19.360> the<00:02:19.390> crossmember<00:02:20.260> we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
also incorporated the crossmember we

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.100 
also incorporated the crossmember we
also<00:02:20.950> made<00:02:21.130> the<00:02:21.280> rack<00:02:21.459> so<00:02:21.790> helps<00:02:22.420> do<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> couple

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
also made the rack so helps do a couple

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.140 
also made the rack so helps do a couple
of<00:02:23.170> things<00:02:23.230> as<00:02:23.650> well<00:02:23.860> it<00:02:24.040> help<00:02:24.489> support<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150 
of things as well it help support the

steering shaft column and lightweight
steering<00:02:36.880> wheel<00:02:37.060> we<00:02:37.959> used<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.200> couple<00:02:38.410> knuckles

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
steering wheel we used a couple knuckles

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.820 
steering wheel we used a couple knuckles
to<00:02:39.070> get<00:02:39.250> the<00:02:39.459> proper<00:02:39.880> geometry<00:02:40.799> for<00:02:41.799> the

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
to get the proper geometry for the

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.759 
to get the proper geometry for the
steering<00:02:42.220> so<00:02:42.489> it<00:02:42.580> steers<00:02:42.880> very<00:02:42.970> easily<00:02:43.769> and

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
steering so it steers very easily and

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.860 
steering so it steers very easily and
also<00:02:45.100> clears<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:45.549> headers<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.150> and<00:02:46.360> some<00:02:46.840> of

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
also clears the headers and and some of

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.300 
also clears the headers and and some of
the<00:02:46.989> other<00:02:47.110> components<00:02:47.470> that<00:02:47.830> we<00:02:47.950> have<00:02:48.100> on<00:02:48.280> a

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
the other components that we have on a

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.820 
the other components that we have on a
car<00:02:48.640> as<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.840> can<00:02:50.019> see<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> Rick<00:02:50.590> Jones

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:50.830

mount on it by the way is only one pound
one<00:02:56.410> in<00:02:56.769> five<00:02:57.040> eighths<00:02:57.310> pounds<00:02:58.000> so<00:02:58.480> it's

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
one in five eighths pounds so it's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.920 
one in five eighths pounds so it's
extremely<00:02:58.900> light<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.390> it's<00:03:01.390> a<00:03:01.480> very<00:03:01.720> very

we cut it out and we had to make some

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.850 
we cut it out and we had to make some
new<00:03:35.650> metal<00:03:35.950> pieces<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:37.090> put<00:03:37.330> it<00:03:37.450> in<00:03:37.650> this<00:03:38.650> guy

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
new metal pieces and put it in this guy

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.190 
new metal pieces and put it in this guy
ass<00:03:39.040> they<00:03:39.220> have<00:03:39.310> all<00:03:39.459> the

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
that'll work done on it before it goes

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:44.479 
that'll work done on it before it goes
to<00:03:42.170> sandblast<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.530> powder<00:03:43.739> coat<00:03:44.069> you<00:03:44.220> can't

go back and redo any bodywork on this
car<00:03:47.550> after<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:48.120> saw<00:03:48.450> the<00:03:48.510> sheet<00:03:48.780> metal<00:03:49.019> work

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
car after that saw the sheet metal work

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.800 
car after that saw the sheet metal work
has<00:03:49.349> to<00:03:49.470> be<00:03:49.590> done<00:03:49.830> and<00:03:50.819> as<00:03:50.970> you<00:03:51.180> can<00:03:51.300> see<00:03:51.360> down

here when we had to do this we had to

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.990 
here when we had to do this we had to
make<00:03:54.900> some<00:03:55.050> compound<00:03:55.950> angles<00:03:56.430> we<00:03:56.640> had<00:03:56.760> to<00:03:56.849> make

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
make some compound angles we had to make

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.610 
make some compound angles we had to make
all<00:03:57.150> this<00:03:57.360> section<00:03:57.900> and<00:03:58.050> we<00:03:58.110> had<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.319> make<00:03:58.470> it

all this section and we had to make it

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.920 
all this section and we had to make it
correctly<00:03:59.010> so<00:03:59.310> it<00:03:59.370> fits<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.540> when<00:04:00.660> the<00:04:00.750> body

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
correctly so it fits so when the body

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.800 
correctly so it fits so when the body
man<00:04:01.200> does<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.709> final<00:04:02.220> finish<00:04:02.640> work<00:04:02.880> on<00:04:03.090> it<00:04:03.330> he

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.509 
man does the final finish work on it he
has<00:04:03.840> less<00:04:04.410> work<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.830> he<00:04:04.920> has<00:04:05.040> to<00:04:05.220> do<00:04:05.370> in<00:04:05.459> a

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
make this work correctly because it's so

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.100

finished job out of it okay we were
talking<00:04:53.620> about<00:04:53.680> how<00:04:54.010> nice<00:04:54.280> the<00:04:54.580> sheetmetal

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
talking about how nice the sheetmetal

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.580 
talking about how nice the sheetmetal
work<00:04:55.330> is<00:04:55.540> on<00:04:55.750> this<00:04:55.900> so<00:04:56.050> you<00:04:56.139> could<00:04:56.290> see<00:04:56.470> it

work is on this so you could see it

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:58.440 
work is on this so you could see it
lines<00:04:56.770> up<00:04:56.980> pretty<00:04:57.280> decent<00:04:57.820> for<00:04:57.910> just<00:04:58.210> laying

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
lines up pretty decent for just laying

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.320 
lines up pretty decent for just laying
it<00:04:58.630> on<00:04:58.750> there<00:04:59.020> right<00:04:59.169> now<00:04:59.729> you<00:05:00.729> can<00:05:00.880> see<00:05:01.090> on<00:05:01.210> the

really nice the mounting points on these
aftermarket<00:05:40.800> body<00:05:41.800> pieces<00:05:42.340> have<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.700> be

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
aftermarket body pieces have to be

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:44.670 
aftermarket body pieces have to be
adjusted<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.450> little<00:05:43.479> bit<00:05:43.840> up<00:05:43.960> here<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.500> and

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
adjusted a little bit up here and and

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
that to give it a crack fit which is

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:51.210 
that to give it a crack fit which is
normal<00:05:48.970> on<00:05:49.090> any<00:05:49.300> aftermarket<00:05:49.690> fender<00:05:50.380> but<00:05:51.039> we

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
normal on any aftermarket fender but we

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:53.310 
normal on any aftermarket fender but we
really<00:05:51.700> like<00:05:51.910> the<00:05:52.060> finish<00:05:52.270> bodywork<00:05:52.900> on<00:05:53.110> these

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:53.320 
really like the finish bodywork on these

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:56.159 
really like the finish bodywork on these
fenders<00:05:53.590> that<00:05:53.890> we<00:05:54.010> got<00:05:54.190> from<00:05:54.430> JW<00:05:54.820> so<00:05:55.240> highly

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:56.169 
fenders that we got from JW so highly

00:05:56.169 --> 00:05:58.290 
fenders that we got from JW so highly
recommended<00:05:56.770> when<00:05:57.039> he<00:05:57.130> can<00:05:57.370> use<00:05:57.700> fresh<00:05:58.030> sheet

00:05:58.290 --> 00:05:58.300 
recommended when he can use fresh sheet

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:26.310 

modified<00:06:24.430> eliminator<00:06:25.090> was<00:06:25.450> a<00:06:25.480> great<00:06:25.900> class

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:26.320 
modified eliminator was a great class

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.470 
modified eliminator was a great class
because<00:06:26.770> it<00:06:26.920> was<00:06:27.010> wait<00:06:27.250> to<00:06:27.460> cubic-inch<00:06:28.000> what

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
because it was wait to cubic-inch what

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.630 
because it was wait to cubic-inch what
racing<00:06:28.900> actually<00:06:29.230> started<00:06:29.590> out<00:06:29.740> today<00:06:29.950> we

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:30.640 
racing actually started out today we

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:36.540 
racing actually started out today we
have<00:06:30.910> a<00:06:30.940> fire<00:06:31.420> playing<00:06:31.840> field<00:06:32.350> and<00:06:35.370> the<00:06:36.370> great

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:36.550 
have a fire playing field and the great

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:38.610 
have a fire playing field and the great
thing<00:06:36.790> about<00:06:36.820> modified<00:06:37.570> the<00:06:37.960> technology

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:38.620 
thing about modified the technology

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:40.530 
thing about modified the technology
would<00:06:38.800> not<00:06:38.980> exist<00:06:39.280> to<00:06:39.760> start<00:06:40.060> with<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.510> was

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.540 
would not exist to start with it was

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.840 
would not exist to start with it was
just<00:06:40.810> one<00:06:41.020> person<00:06:41.440> against<00:06:41.740> another

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
just one person against another

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:44.220 
just one person against another
basically<00:06:42.850> the<00:06:43.060> money<00:06:43.270> wasn't<00:06:43.600> involved<00:06:43.900> high

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
basically the money wasn't involved high

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.170 
basically the money wasn't involved high
technology<00:06:44.920> wasn't<00:06:45.100> involved<00:06:45.730> it<00:06:45.820> was<00:06:45.940> just

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:46.180 
technology wasn't involved it was just

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.330 
technology wasn't involved it was just
us<00:06:46.330> competing<00:06:47.140> like<00:06:47.440> a<00:06:47.500> sport<00:06:47.890> and<00:06:50.340> the

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:51.340 
us competing like a sport and the

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:55.700 
us competing like a sport and the
technology<00:06:52.090> kind<00:06:52.780> of<00:06:53.760> unfolded<00:06:54.760> over<00:06:54.940> a<00:06:55.300> long

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:55.710 
technology kind of unfolded over a long

00:06:55.710 --> 00:06:59.760 
technology kind of unfolded over a long
period<00:06:56.710> of<00:06:56.800> time<00:06:57.150> until<00:06:58.150> modern<00:06:58.960> times<00:06:59.380> when

00:06:59.760 --> 00:06:59.770 
period of time until modern times when

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.940 
period of time until modern times when
learning<00:07:00.310> and<00:07:00.730> this<00:07:01.169> electronic<00:07:02.169> technology

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:02.950 
learning and this electronic technology

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:05.909 
learning and this electronic technology
just<00:07:03.220> took<00:07:03.340> this<00:07:03.520> stuff<00:07:03.790> off<00:07:04.000> the<00:07:04.180> scale<00:07:04.919> and

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:05.919 
just took this stuff off the scale and

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.340 
just took this stuff off the scale and
being<00:07:06.430> it<00:07:06.610> was<00:07:06.760> just<00:07:06.970> more<00:07:07.240> like<00:07:07.300> like<00:07:07.900> a<00:07:07.930> sport

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:08.350 
being it was just more like like a sport

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.710 
being it was just more like like a sport
like<00:07:08.710> a<00:07:09.580> heavyweight<00:07:09.940> exported<00:07:10.540> as<00:07:10.630> a

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:10.720 
like a heavyweight exported as a

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.740 
like a heavyweight exported as a
competition<00:07:11.200> between<00:07:11.470> me<00:07:11.680> and<00:07:11.950> you<00:07:12.070> and<00:07:12.750> it

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
competition between me and you and it

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.300 
competition between me and you and it
was<00:07:13.900> great<00:07:14.200> and<00:07:14.230> it<00:07:14.440> was<00:07:14.530> fair<00:07:14.800> and<00:07:14.830> it<00:07:15.160> was

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:15.310 
was great and it was fair and it was

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:17.340 
was great and it was fair and it was
flat<00:07:15.669> out<00:07:15.940> to<00:07:16.180> start<00:07:16.450> with<00:07:16.570> like<00:07:16.960> the<00:07:17.140> class

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350 
flat out to start with like the class

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:22.020 
flat out to start with like the class
some<00:07:17.680> of<00:07:17.770> the<00:07:17.860> pro<00:07:18.100> classes<00:07:18.580> are<00:07:18.729> today<00:07:21.030> really

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:22.030 
some of the pro classes are today really

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.280 
some of the pro classes are today really
the<00:07:22.240> the<00:07:23.050> sharp<00:07:23.290> God<00:07:23.590> could<00:07:24.070> win
