00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
will be on pokemon black so a lot of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
will be on pokemon black so a lot of
people<00:00:53.550> were<00:00:53.640> probably<00:00:53.879> gonna<00:00:54.090> get<00:00:54.300> black<00:00:54.539> but

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
people were probably gonna get black but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.420 
people were probably gonna get black but
now<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.230> compared<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.710> why<00:00:55.829> i<00:00:55.860> guess<00:00:56.250> they

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
now it's compared to why i guess they

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.180 
now it's compared to why i guess they
wanted<00:00:56.670> white<00:00:56.940> get<00:00:57.270> some<00:00:57.480> people<00:00:57.930> i<00:00:58.190> probably

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
uncommon like when diamond and pearl

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.090 
uncommon like when diamond and pearl
came<00:01:06.720> out<00:01:06.810> more<00:01:07.020> he<00:01:07.140> woke<00:01:07.290> up<00:01:07.409> pearl<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
stupid these legends suck not just on

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.170 
stupid these legends suck not just on
one<00:01:27.299> I<00:01:27.330> mean<00:01:27.630> both<00:01:28.670> but<00:01:29.670> these<00:01:29.820> are<00:01:29.939> very

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
one I mean both but these are very

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.789 
one I mean both but these are very
creative<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:30.600> let's<00:01:30.810> look<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.049> some<00:01:31.170> physical

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
creative but let's look at some physical

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.899 
creative but let's look at some physical
features<00:01:32.340> they<00:01:33.180> both<00:01:33.360> have<00:01:33.540> wings<00:01:34.100> but<00:01:35.100> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
features they both have wings but the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.850 
features they both have wings but the
restaurant<00:01:36.390> has<00:01:36.600> wings<00:01:36.840> as<00:01:37.200> hands<00:01:37.619> on<00:01:37.710> its

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
restaurant has wings as hands on its

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.350 
restaurant has wings as hands on its
wings<00:01:38.070> so<00:01:38.250> he<00:01:38.280> probably<00:01:38.640> is<00:01:38.850> probably<00:01:39.150> only

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
wings so he probably is probably only

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.380 
wings so he probably is probably only
flying<00:01:39.840> and<00:01:40.110> dragon<00:01:40.850> possibly<00:01:41.850> new<00:01:42.090> types

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
flying and dragon possibly new types

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.359 
flying and dragon possibly new types
there<00:01:42.840> may<00:01:42.990> be<00:01:43.020> a<00:01:43.140> new<00:01:43.350> type<00:01:43.590> people<00:01:44.280> are

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
there may be a new type people are

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.280 
there may be a new type people are
foreshadowing<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:45.060> light<00:01:45.479> type<00:01:45.810> which<00:01:46.079> I've

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
foreshadowing the light type which I've

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.940 
foreshadowing the light type which I've
wanted<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.890> be<00:01:46.979> a<00:01:47.100> type<00:01:48.229> they<00:01:49.229> possibly<00:01:49.770> could

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
wanted to be a type they possibly could

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.160 
wanted to be a type they possibly could
be<00:01:50.100> a<00:01:50.130> light<00:01:50.460> type<00:01:50.759> or<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.299> normal<00:01:51.540> flu<00:01:51.930> or

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
be a light type or just a normal flu or

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.440 
be a light type or just a normal flu or
something<00:01:52.380> flying<00:01:52.860> so<00:01:53.850> it's<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> they're

weird if zekrom was on the black logo
because<00:03:11.890> any<00:03:12.040> kind<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.340> look<00:03:12.459> like<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.670> kind<00:03:12.880> of

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
because any kind of look like it kind of

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.729 
because any kind of look like it kind of
blend<00:03:13.239> in<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.690> same<00:03:13.870> thing<00:03:13.900> with<00:03:14.050> restaurant

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:14.739

trying<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:14.920> sound<00:03:15.420> Pokemon<00:03:16.420> raised<00:03:16.660> this<00:03:16.930> but

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
trying to sound Pokemon raised this but

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.740 
trying to sound Pokemon raised this but
it's<00:03:17.709> kind<00:03:17.950> of<00:03:18.060> so<00:03:19.060> it<00:03:19.150> kind<00:03:19.299> of<00:03:19.329> makes<00:03:19.480> sense

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
it's kind of so it kind of makes sense

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.990 
it's kind of so it kind of makes sense
black<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.769> so<00:03:21.070> it's<00:03:21.220> like<00:03:21.340> both<00:03:21.519> the<00:03:21.670> colors

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
black and so it's like both the colors

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.840 
black and so it's like both the colors
black<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.269> white<00:03:22.600> or<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.989> each<00:03:23.440> game<00:03:23.799> I<00:03:24.100> know<00:03:24.730> I

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
black and white or in each game I know I

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.360 
black and white or in each game I know I
may<00:03:25.060> not<00:03:25.180> be<00:03:25.450> making<00:03:25.630> much<00:03:25.870> sense<00:03:25.900> here<00:03:26.500> but

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
may not be making much sense here but

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.250 
may not be making much sense here but

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:28.960 
be both dragon probably not though I

can't tell but that comes probably a

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.920 
can't tell but that comes probably a
dark-type<00:05:32.490> restaurant<00:05:33.490> probably<00:05:33.760> if<00:05:34.630> there's

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:34.930 
dark-type restaurant probably if there's

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:36.810 
dark-type restaurant probably if there's
a<00:05:35.020> light<00:05:35.200> type<00:05:35.470> if<00:05:36.099> that's<00:05:36.340> a<00:05:36.460> new<00:05:36.580> type

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
a light type if that's a new type

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.399 
a light type if that's a new type
because<00:05:37.030> I<00:05:37.090> believe<00:05:37.419> I<00:05:37.599> heard<00:05:37.750> there's

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:38.409 
because I believe I heard there's

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:40.080 
because I believe I heard there's
something<00:05:38.800> new<00:05:39.039> added<00:05:39.430> to<00:05:39.490> the<00:05:39.610> game<00:05:39.849> but<00:05:40.030> i

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:40.090 
something new added to the game but i

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:41.420 
something new added to the game but i
believe<00:05:40.180> it<00:05:40.599> was<00:05:40.690> in<00:05:40.780> terms<00:05:41.050> of<00:05:41.169> evolution

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
believe it was in terms of evolution

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:44.190 
believe it was in terms of evolution
which<00:05:42.430> I'm<00:05:42.640> if<00:05:43.000> I<00:05:43.090> remember<00:05:43.330> correctly<00:05:43.360> it's

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
which I'm if I remember correctly it's

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.409 
which I'm if I remember correctly it's
house<00:05:44.409> or<00:05:44.770> Rua<00:05:44.950> can<00:05:45.250> evolve<00:05:45.430> an<00:05:45.610> azure<00:05:45.970> quits<00:05:46.360> a

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:46.419 
house or Rua can evolve an azure quits a

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.010 
house or Rua can evolve an azure quits a
new<00:05:46.900> type<00:05:47.169> of<00:05:47.460> evolving<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.640> pokemon<00:05:49.120> but<00:05:49.990> I
