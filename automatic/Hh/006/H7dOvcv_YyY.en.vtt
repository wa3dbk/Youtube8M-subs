no time to lose I have to hurry it it's
mainly<00:00:39.480> because<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.840> music<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.680> style<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.640> it

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
mainly because the music the style of it

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.450 
mainly because the music the style of it
yeah<00:00:42.149> atmosphere<00:00:42.660> oh<00:00:42.870> that's<00:00:43.170> yeah<00:00:43.469> really

yeah atmosphere oh that's yeah really
nice<00:00:45.050> invisibly<00:00:46.050> getting<00:00:46.410> shovel<00:00:46.770> claw<00:00:46.950> this

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
nice invisibly getting shovel claw this

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.069 
nice invisibly getting shovel claw this
is<00:00:47.879> probably<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.149> only<00:00:48.329> knuckle<00:00:48.750> level<00:00:48.989> I

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
is probably the only knuckle level I

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.260 
is probably the only knuckle level I
don't<00:00:49.320> mind<00:00:49.700> just<00:00:50.700> because<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
don't mind just because of the

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.119 
don't mind just because of the
atmosphere<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.930> music<00:00:52.320> and<00:00:52.440> such<00:00:52.620> yeah<00:00:53.100> I
