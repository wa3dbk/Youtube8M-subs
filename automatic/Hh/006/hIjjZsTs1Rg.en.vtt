00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
for a map and it looks as if flash is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.090 
for a map and it looks as if flash is
going<00:00:53.940> to<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.390> red<00:00:55.350> Terran<00:00:55.829> they're<00:00:55.980> going

buildings<00:00:58.469> he's<00:00:58.620> gonna<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> yellow

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
buildings he's gonna have a yellow

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.010 
buildings he's gonna have a yellow
outline<00:00:59.340> oh<00:00:59.789> he<00:01:00.359> has<00:01:00.449> changed<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.870> yellow

outline oh he has changed to yellow
actually<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:02.120> it<00:01:03.120> looks<00:01:03.300> like<00:01:03.359> fantasy<00:01:03.960> is

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
actually and so it looks like fantasy is

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.020 
actually and so it looks like fantasy is
actually<00:01:04.409> going<00:01:04.500> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:05.460> red<00:01:05.640> tear<00:01:05.909> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
actually going to be the red tear and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.010 
actually going to be the red tear and
i'm<00:01:06.090> not<00:01:06.180> sure<00:01:06.330> why<00:01:06.450> they<00:01:06.570> switch<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> colors

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
i'm not sure why they switch the colors

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.660 
i'm not sure why they switch the colors
like<00:01:07.320> that<00:01:07.500> that's<00:01:07.710> weird<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:11.220> fantasies

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
like that that's weird so fantasies

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.800 
like that that's weird so fantasies
actually<00:01:11.939> gonna<00:01:12.030> be<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.180> red<00:01:12.299> Terran<00:01:12.600> at<00:01:12.720> the

actually gonna be the red Terran at the
top<00:01:12.960> left<00:01:13.170> corner<00:01:13.260> flashes<00:01:14.220> give<00:01:14.369> me<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
top left corner flashes give me the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.620 
top left corner flashes give me the
yellow<00:01:14.700> turn<00:01:14.909> at<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> bottom<00:01:15.509> right<00:01:15.600> hand

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
yellow turn at the bottom right hand

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.340 
yellow turn at the bottom right hand
corner<00:01:15.990> by<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.619> way<00:01:16.830> it's<00:01:17.790> fixed

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
corner by the way it's fixed

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.050 
corner by the way it's fixed
I<00:01:19.380> must<00:01:20.159> admit<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.520> was<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.760> little<00:01:20.850> bit

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
I must admit I was a little bit

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.469 
I must admit I was a little bit
frustrated<00:01:21.720> by<00:01:22.470> fraps<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.250> I<00:01:23.700> was<00:01:23.820> starting

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
frustrated by fraps and I was starting

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.730 
frustrated by fraps and I was starting
to<00:01:24.540> think<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.840> was<00:01:24.960> never<00:01:25.140> going<00:01:25.259> to<00:01:25.320> work<00:01:25.409> but

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
to think it was never going to work but

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.880 
to think it was never going to work but
the<00:01:27.049> support<00:01:28.049> guys<00:01:28.229> actually<00:01:28.500> helped<00:01:28.830> me

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
the support guys actually helped me

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.109 
the support guys actually helped me
through<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.369> fixed<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.729> issue<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:30.000> was

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
through it and I fixed the issue it was

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.510 
through it and I fixed the issue it was
a<00:01:30.150> sample<00:01:30.600> rate<00:01:30.750> issue<00:01:31.100> apparently<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
a sample rate issue apparently the

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.860 
a sample rate issue apparently the
sample<00:01:33.270> rate<00:01:33.360> of<00:01:33.479> my<00:01:33.600> microphone<00:01:34.049> is<00:01:34.200> crap

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
sample rate of my microphone is crap

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:38.410 
sample rate of my microphone is crap
and<00:01:36.710> so<00:01:37.010> the<00:01:37.430> sample<00:01:37.820> rate<00:01:37.910> of<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.060> speakers

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
and so the sample rate of the speakers

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.540 
and so the sample rate of the speakers
was<00:01:38.720> at<00:01:38.870> 44<00:01:39.380> k<00:01:39.740> and<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.100> separated

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
was at 44 k and the separated

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.540 
was at 44 k and the separated
microphones<00:01:41.210> at<00:01:41.390> 16k<00:01:41.750> and<00:01:42.620> most<00:01:43.250> of<00:01:43.370> you<00:01:43.430> don't

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
microphones at 16k and most of you don't

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.730 
microphones at 16k and most of you don't
really<00:01:43.760> care<00:01:44.000> so<00:01:44.630> anyways<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.290> was<00:01:45.320> causing

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
really care so anyways it was causing

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:47.530 
really care so anyways it was causing
the<00:01:45.830> audio<00:01:46.220> to<00:01:46.340> come<00:01:46.460> out<00:01:46.550> scratchy<00:01:46.910> and<00:01:47.330> so

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
the audio to come out scratchy and so

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.710 
the audio to come out scratchy and so
it's<00:01:47.780> just<00:01:47.870> the<00:01:47.990> unlistenable<00:01:48.680> and<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.420> now<00:01:50.570> it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:50.720 
it's just the unlistenable and so now it

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.890 
it's just the unlistenable and so now it
works<00:01:50.930> though<00:01:51.400> unfortunately<00:01:52.400> the<00:01:52.460> 16<00:01:53.330> 16

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
works though unfortunately the 16 16

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.650 
works though unfortunately the 16 16
came<00:01:54.170> audio<00:01:54.830> rape<00:01:55.010> but<00:01:55.190> still<00:01:55.460> it's<00:01:56.150> just<00:01:56.390> fine

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
came audio rape but still it's just fine

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.770 
came audio rape but still it's just fine
for<00:01:56.870> most<00:01:57.020> things<00:01:57.640> this<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.820> mostly<00:01:59.180> a<00:01:59.270> video

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
for most things this is mostly a video

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.320 
for most things this is mostly a video
game<00:02:00.230> not<00:02:00.860> an<00:02:00.980> audio<00:02:01.250> game<00:02:01.460> so<00:02:01.790> I<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.120> it'll

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
game not an audio game so I think it'll

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.230 
game not an audio game so I think it'll
be<00:02:02.450> fine<00:02:02.660> anyway<00:02:05.230> also<00:02:06.230> I<00:02:06.260> realized<00:02:07.060> as<00:02:08.060> I<00:02:08.210> was

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240

getting<00:02:08.390> some<00:02:08.630> water<00:02:09.310> between<00:02:10.310> the<00:02:10.490> games

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:10.760 
getting some water between the games

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.950 
getting some water between the games

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:14.960 
here and troubleshooting that I've

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.930 
here and troubleshooting that I've
didn't<00:02:15.650> finish<00:02:15.740> the<00:02:15.950> thought<00:02:16.070> before<00:02:16.250> I<00:02:16.610> was

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
didn't finish the thought before I was

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.790 
didn't finish the thought before I was
thinking<00:02:17.150> about<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.300> and<00:02:17.420> I<00:02:17.630> think<00:02:17.710> you<00:02:18.710> know

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:18.800

that's why i'm thinking i might just you
know<00:02:30.440> make<00:02:30.830> a<00:02:30.860> new<00:02:31.160> account<00:02:31.460> for<00:02:32.680> starcraft<00:02:33.680> 2

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
know make a new account for starcraft 2

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.770 
know make a new account for starcraft 2
stuff<00:02:34.160> have<00:02:34.580> that<00:02:34.790> separate<00:02:35.210> from<00:02:35.360> starcraft

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
stuff have that separate from starcraft

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.180 
stuff have that separate from starcraft
one<00:02:37.570> yeah<00:02:38.570> i<00:02:38.810> haven't<00:02:39.350> decided<00:02:39.680> yet<00:02:39.920> but<00:02:40.130> i

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:40.190 
one yeah i haven't decided yet but i

be<00:03:54.990> good<00:03:55.260> spot<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:56.090> fantasy<00:03:57.090> to<00:03:57.210> try<00:03:57.390> and

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
be good spot for fantasy to try and

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:00.860 
be good spot for fantasy to try and
cheese<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:59.010> try<00:03:59.250> and<00:03:59.370> get<00:03:59.490> another<00:04:00.030> win<00:04:00.450> under

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
cheese to try and get another win under

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.610 
cheese to try and get another win under
his<00:04:01.110> belt<00:04:01.380> too<00:04:02.090> oh<00:04:03.090> not<00:04:04.050> necessarily<00:04:04.170> but

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
his belt too oh not necessarily but

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.400 
his belt too oh not necessarily but
usually<00:04:05.460> if<00:04:06.360> you<00:04:06.420> don't<00:04:06.780> want<00:04:07.050> to<00:04:07.140> do<00:04:07.230> the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
usually if you don't want to do the

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.670 
usually if you don't want to do the
cheese<00:04:07.620> in<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.860> risky<00:04:08.340> spot<00:04:08.640> oh<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:10.230> completes

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
cheese in a risky spot oh and completes

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.170 
cheese in a risky spot oh and completes
the bunker<00:04:11.040> before<00:04:11.190> he<00:04:11.460> Scouts<00:04:11.820> so<00:04:12.060> he

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
the bunker before he Scouts so he

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.670 
the bunker before he Scouts so he
doesn't<00:04:12.360> know<00:04:12.570> that<00:04:12.600> that<00:04:13.080> fantasy<00:04:13.380> is<00:04:13.560> gone

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
doesn't know that that fantasy is gone

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.099 
doesn't know that that fantasy is gone
for<00:04:13.920> this<00:04:13.980> quick<00:04:14.220> command<00:04:15.120> center<00:04:15.450> and<00:04:16.019> his

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
for this quick command center and his

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:17.750 
for this quick command center and his
way<00:04:16.290> behind<00:04:16.709> so<00:04:16.890> he's<00:04:17.010> actually<00:04:17.130> a<00:04:17.280> place<00:04:17.580> down

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
way behind so he's actually a place down

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.120 
way behind so he's actually a place down
a<00:04:17.790> bunker<00:04:18.390> which<00:04:19.109> is<00:04:19.140> unnecessary<00:04:19.920> at<00:04:20.010> this

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
a bunker which is unnecessary at this

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:21.500 
a bunker which is unnecessary at this
point<00:04:20.400> he's<00:04:20.549> getting<00:04:20.790> on<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.910> factory<00:04:21.299> though

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
point he's getting on a factory though

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.020 
point he's getting on a factory though
so<00:04:22.020> we're<00:04:22.170> kind<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.320> seeing<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:25.070> anyway<00:04:26.070> so

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
so we're kind of seeing a anyway so

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:30.440 
so we're kind of seeing a anyway so
we'll<00:04:27.540> see<00:04:27.750> if<00:04:27.780> he<00:04:27.900> puts<00:04:28.140> out<00:04:28.230> maybe<00:04:28.640> a<00:04:29.640> vulture

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
we'll see if he puts out maybe a vulture

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:32.120 
we'll see if he puts out maybe a vulture
and<00:04:30.960> tries<00:04:31.200> to<00:04:31.380> attack<00:04:31.590> with<00:04:31.740> a<00:04:31.800> vulture<00:04:32.100> or

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
and tries to attack with a vulture or

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.470 
and tries to attack with a vulture or
something<00:04:32.430> like<00:04:32.490> that<00:04:32.550> I<00:04:32.850> guess<00:04:33.180> flash

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480 
something like that I guess flash

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.780 
something like that I guess flash
basically<00:04:34.020> figures<00:04:34.380> it<00:04:35.010> figures<00:04:35.130> you<00:04:35.370> know<00:04:35.490> I

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
basically figures it figures you know I

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.870 
basically figures it figures you know I
can<00:04:36.570> afford<00:04:36.900> to<00:04:36.960> spend<00:04:37.350> get<00:04:37.980> a<00:04:38.010> little<00:04:38.760> bit

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:40.980 
behind at the beginning so make sure I'm

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.480

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
safe in order to you know then I can try

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.700 
safe in order to you know then I can try

there<00:05:05.270> anyway<00:05:06.270> both<00:05:06.780> players<00:05:06.930> getting<00:05:07.200> a<00:05:07.320> go

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
there anyway both players getting a go

there anyway both players getting a go
down<00:05:07.680> a<00:05:07.710> couple<00:05:07.920> factories<00:05:08.460> to<00:05:08.490> fill<00:05:08.760> up<00:05:08.910> with

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.060 
down a couple factories to fill up with

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:10.430 
down a couple factories to fill up with
and<00:05:09.330> it<00:05:09.390> looks<00:05:09.540> like<00:05:09.600> flash<00:05:09.960> is<00:05:10.170> pretty<00:05:10.350> much

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:10.440 
and it looks like flash is pretty much

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.100 
and it looks like flash is pretty much
going<00:05:10.680> to<00:05:10.740> miss<00:05:11.400> out<00:05:11.580> on<00:05:11.730> this<00:05:11.820> opportunity<00:05:12.110> to

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:13.110 
going to miss out on this opportunity to

00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:15.050 
going to miss out on this opportunity to
attack<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:14.160> fantasy<00:05:14.580> well<00:05:14.760> he's<00:05:14.940> a<00:05:14.970> little

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:15.060 
attack the fantasy well he's a little

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.550 
attack the fantasy well he's a little
bit<00:05:15.420> vulnerable<00:05:15.690> from<00:05:15.990> getting<00:05:16.230> that<00:05:16.350> early

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
bit vulnerable from getting that early

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.550 
bit vulnerable from getting that early
command<00:05:16.860> center<00:05:17.540> which<00:05:18.540> is<00:05:18.570> unfortunate<00:05:19.320> so

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
command center which is unfortunate so

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:21.710 
command center which is unfortunate so
fantasy<00:05:20.400> and<00:05:20.520> fancy<00:05:20.880> is<00:05:20.940> really<00:05:21.270> not<00:05:21.420> playing

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
fantasy and fancy is really not playing

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:23.720 
fantasy and fancy is really not playing

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:23.730 
offensive defensively at all either he's

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:25.940 
offensive defensively at all either he's

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.040 
got the two Marines at his front door I
don't<00:05:26.160> know<00:05:26.250> if<00:05:26.310> maybe<00:05:26.520> they<00:05:26.750> know<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.810> don't

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
don't know if maybe they know I don't

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.390 
don't know if maybe they know I don't

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
think they kept finished flash from

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.210 
think they kept finished flash from

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:32.220 
scouting a command center I wasn't

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.140 
scouting a command center I wasn't
paying<00:05:32.310> attention<00:05:32.400> what<00:05:32.730> happened<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:33.000> guys

blame<00:06:38.949> flash<00:06:39.280> for<00:06:39.520> being<00:06:39.699> more<00:06:39.880> interested<00:06:40.240> in

blame flash for being more interested in

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.570 
blame flash for being more interested in
winning<00:06:40.419> Starcraft<00:06:40.990> and<00:06:41.250> making<00:06:42.250> me<00:06:42.370> right

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
winning Starcraft and making me right

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.430 
winning Starcraft and making me right
but<00:06:43.330> I<00:06:43.360> guess<00:06:43.750> it<00:06:43.900> just<00:06:43.930> makes<00:06:44.199> sense<00:06:44.289> because

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:44.440 
but I guess it just makes sense because

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.110 
but I guess it just makes sense because
he<00:06:44.620> hasn't<00:06:44.979> had<00:06:45.190> much<00:06:45.310> scouting<00:06:45.669> information

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:47.800 
in the fantasy space so he didn't know

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.050 
in the fantasy space so he didn't know
if<00:06:47.919> there<00:06:48.009> were<00:06:48.130> rates<00:06:48.370> coming<00:06:48.699> out<00:06:48.880> and<00:06:48.970> he
