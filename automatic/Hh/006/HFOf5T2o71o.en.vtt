00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.030 
infinite channel system that Burton has
and<00:01:30.060> is<00:01:30.150> known<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.659> what<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.619> does<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.860> it

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040 
and is known for what that does is it

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.260 
and is known for what that does is it
makes<00:01:32.159> it<00:01:32.430> so<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.610> have<00:01:32.729> an<00:01:32.820> infinite<00:01:33.060> amount

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
makes it so you have an infinite amount

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.240 
makes it so you have an infinite amount
of<00:01:33.479> Stan's<00:01:33.750> options<00:01:34.229> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.130> it

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
of Stan's options you can really have it

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.310 
of Stan's options you can really have it
fine<00:01:35.820> tuned<00:01:36.090> down<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.540> the<00:01:36.630> millimeter<00:01:36.930> if<00:01:37.200> you

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
fine tuned down to the millimeter if you

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.499 
fine tuned down to the millimeter if you
want<00:01:37.530> to<00:01:37.740> and<00:01:38.520> it<00:01:38.610> works<00:01:38.790> awesomely<00:01:39.240> with<00:01:39.420> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
want to and it works awesomely with the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.469 
want to and it works awesomely with the
EST<00:01:39.960> bindings<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:40.470> Burton<00:01:40.829> has<00:01:40.979> also<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.270> top

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
EST bindings that Burton has also on top

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.510 
EST bindings that Burton has also on top
of<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.710> going<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.890> have<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.130> infinite

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
of that it's going to have the infinite

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.370 
of that it's going to have the infinite
ride<00:01:44.670> what<00:01:45.270> Burton<00:01:45.509> does<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:45.930> they<00:01:46.079> break<00:01:46.350> down

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
ride what Burton does is they break down

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.230 
ride what Burton does is they break down
their<00:01:46.860> boards<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.820> build<00:01:48.000> them<00:01:48.090> up<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> little

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
their boards they build them up a little

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
their boards they build them up a little
more<00:01:48.450> beefy<00:01:48.750> and<00:01:48.840> then<00:01:48.960> break<00:01:49.140> them<00:01:49.290> down<00:01:49.320> so

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
more beefy and then break them down so

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.920 
more beefy and then break them down so
that<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.340> Flex<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.939> has<00:01:51.119> is<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.869> to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that the Flex that this has is going to

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.990 
that the Flex that this has is going to
be<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.140> same<00:01:52.350> and<00:01:53.130> it's<00:01:53.340> not<00:01:53.490> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.759> you

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
be the same and it's not going to you

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.690 
be the same and it's not going to you
know<00:01:54.409> work<00:01:55.409> down<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:55.979> wet<00:01:56.219> noodle<00:01:56.250> for

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
know work down to like a wet noodle for

know work down to like a wet noodle for
you<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:58.040> the<00:01:59.040> flex<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.369> this<00:01:59.490> guy's<00:01:59.670> will<00:01:59.850> be

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
you and the flex and this guy's will be

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.310 
you and the flex and this guy's will be
coming<00:02:00.090> into<00:02:00.270> ball<00:02:00.450> four<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.960> right<00:02:01.110> in<00:02:01.229> the

middle mid line there and you know on

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.450 
middle mid line there and you know on
top<00:02:04.380> of<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:05.009> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.159> have<00:02:05.280> a<00:02:05.310> nice

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
top of that it's going to have a nice

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.940 
top of that it's going to have a nice

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
higher end basis but it's still going to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.640 
higher end basis but it's still going to
hold<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.970> lot<00:02:12.150> of<00:02:12.180> wax<00:02:12.450> but<00:02:12.750> also<00:02:12.870> at<00:02:13.080> the<00:02:13.200> same
