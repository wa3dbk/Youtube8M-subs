so<00:00:08.790> my<00:00:08.910> first<00:00:09.120> serious<00:00:09.599> computer<00:00:10.019> was<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> BBC

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
so my first serious computer was a BBC

it<00:00:38.280> was<00:00:38.460> very<00:00:38.670> expensive<00:00:38.940> with<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.450> 400

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
it was very expensive with like 400

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.590 
it was very expensive with like 400
pounds<00:00:40.219> even<00:00:41.219> for<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.610> base<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:42.329> you<00:00:42.510> know

pounds even for the base that you know
the<00:00:42.660> most<00:00:42.840> basic<00:00:43.230> model<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.710> think<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.520> paid<00:00:44.730> 300

the most basic model I think I paid 300
for<00:00:45.809> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
for it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.369

III I bought mine in like 1986 or 1987
off<00:00:49.920> after<00:00:50.399> they'd<00:00:50.579> finished<00:00:51.090> even<00:00:51.510> being

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
off after they'd finished even being

off after they'd finished even being
manufactured<00:00:52.699> after<00:00:53.699> I'd<00:00:53.820> saved<00:00:54.120> up<00:00:54.239> my

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
manufactured after I'd saved up my

manufactured after I'd saved up my
pennies<00:00:54.719> doing<00:00:55.020> paper<00:00:55.260> around<00:00:56.300> so<00:00:57.300> a<00:00:57.840> bit

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289

celebrate I thought I'd I'd buy this

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.219 
celebrate I thought I'd I'd buy this
machine<00:01:11.790> from<00:01:12.270> from<00:01:12.630> eBay

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
machine from from eBay

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.200 
machine from from eBay
the<00:01:13.770> original<00:01:14.340> machine<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:14.820> had<00:01:15.030> years

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
the original machine that I had years

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.080 
the original machine that I had years
ago<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.540> solved<00:01:16.259> to<00:01:16.560> pay<00:01:17.520> for<00:01:17.790> my<00:01:17.970> grades<00:01:20.090> so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
ago I solved to pay for my grades so

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
ago I solved to pay for my grades so
this<00:01:21.330> one<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.479> bought<00:01:21.689> from<00:01:21.780> eBay<00:01:21.930> for<00:01:22.259> 25

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
this one I bought from eBay for 25

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.160 
this one I bought from eBay for 25
pounds<00:01:23.750> I<00:01:24.750> think<00:01:25.170> like<00:01:25.890> December<00:01:26.430> 20<00:01:26.930> 23rd<00:01:27.930> or

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
pounds I think like December 20 23rd or

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.760 
pounds I think like December 20 23rd or
something<00:01:28.560> 22nd<00:01:30.380> unfortunately<00:01:31.380> this<00:01:31.500> one

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
something 22nd unfortunately this one

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.490 
something 22nd unfortunately this one
doesn't<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.520> disk<00:01:32.759> drive<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.600> even<00:01:34.350> worse

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
doesn't have a disk drive and even worse

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.569 
doesn't have a disk drive and even worse
than<00:01:34.590> that<00:01:34.680> doesn't<00:01:35.009> even<00:01:35.100> have<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.340> disk

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
than that doesn't even have a disk

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.420 
than that doesn't even have a disk
controller<00:01:35.970> so<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.329> can't<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:37.020> can't<00:01:37.860> just<00:01:38.100> buy<00:01:38.400> a

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
controller so I can't I can't just buy a

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.280 
controller so I can't I can't just buy a
disk<00:01:38.700> drive<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.030> plug<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.270> in<00:01:39.390> I<00:01:39.600> would<00:01:40.140> have

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
disk drive and plug it in I would have

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.440 
disk drive and plug it in I would have
to<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.710> buy<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.520> disk<00:01:41.759> controller<00:01:41.880> chip

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
to actually buy the disk controller chip

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.210 
to actually buy the disk controller chip
and<00:01:42.689> plug<00:01:43.229> that<00:01:43.259> into<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.710> motherboard<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
and plug that into the motherboard and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.730 
and plug that into the motherboard and
so<00:01:44.399> on<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.869> would<00:01:45.990> all<00:01:46.079> end<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.590> be

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
so on and it would all end up to be

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.060 
so on and it would all end up to be
actually<00:01:47.399> quite<00:01:47.610> expensive<00:01:48.409> and<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.740> result

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
actually quite expensive and the result

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.950 
actually quite expensive and the result
would<00:01:50.189> be<00:01:50.340> quite<00:01:50.579> clunky<00:01:51.299> by<00:01:51.630> modern

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
would be quite clunky by modern

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.039 
would be quite clunky by modern
standards<00:01:52.079> I<00:01:52.500> mean<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.670> BBC's<00:01:54.299> floppy

disk disks like this we start getting
increasingly<00:01:59.909> difficult<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.450> get<00:02:00.840> hold<00:02:01.020> of

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
increasingly difficult to get hold of

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
increasingly difficult to get hold of
and<00:02:01.439> they're<00:02:02.250> slow<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.579> unreliable<00:02:03.180> etc<00:02:03.960> etc

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
and they're slow and unreliable etc etc

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.100 
and they're slow and unreliable etc etc
so<00:02:04.350> as<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.219> solution<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.390> thought<00:02:06.750> well

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
so as a solution to that I thought well

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.740 
so as a solution to that I thought well
why<00:02:07.590> not<00:02:07.619> marry<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.759> old<00:02:08.970> technology<00:02:09.539> of<00:02:09.660> the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
why not marry the old technology of the

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.510 
why not marry the old technology of the
BBC<00:02:10.080> micro<00:02:10.229> with<00:02:10.679> the<00:02:10.830> new<00:02:10.979> technology<00:02:11.489> that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
BBC micro with the new technology that

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.880 
BBC micro with the new technology that
we

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
we

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.610 
we
available<00:02:12.550> today<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.960> result<00:02:14.290> was<00:02:14.440> this

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
available today and the result was this

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.990 
available today and the result was this
which<00:02:14.980> I<00:02:15.250> made<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.330> it's<00:02:16.810> a<00:02:16.990> minimus<00:02:18.000> a

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
which I made it so it's a minimus a

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.340 
which I made it so it's a minimus a
minimus<00:02:19.770> USB<00:02:21.000> development<00:02:22.000> kit<00:02:22.240> which<00:02:23.020> I<00:02:23.140> paid

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
minimus USB development kit which I paid

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.610 
minimus USB development kit which I paid

five pounds for connected to a ribbon

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.980 
five pounds for connected to a ribbon
cable<00:02:26.800> and<00:02:27.790> plugged<00:02:28.120> into<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.510> bottom<00:02:28.810> of<00:02:28.930> the

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:33.010 
BBC micro the user port so the great

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:34.860 
BBC micro the user port so the great
thing<00:02:33.040> about<00:02:33.250> these<00:02:33.610> these<00:02:34.209> little<00:02:34.540> micro

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
thing about these these little micro

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.600 
thing about these these little micro
controllers<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.560> that<00:02:35.890> they<00:02:36.160> are<00:02:36.340> very<00:02:36.520> cheap

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
controllers is that they are very cheap

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.960 
controllers is that they are very cheap
five<00:02:37.150> pounds<00:02:37.510> the<00:02:37.900> price<00:02:38.110> of<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.290> pint<00:02:38.440> of<00:02:38.530> beer

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
five pounds the price of a pint of beer

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.020 
five pounds the price of a pint of beer
they<00:02:39.970> have<00:02:40.000> native<00:02:40.630> USB<00:02:41.290> connectivity<00:02:42.069> so<00:02:42.610> you

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
they have native USB connectivity so you

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.130 
they have native USB connectivity so you
know<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.209> don't<00:02:43.360> have<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.600> have<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.900> have<00:02:43.989> any

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
know you don't have to have to have any

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.280 
know you don't have to have to have any
extra<00:02:44.440> chips<00:02:45.400> like<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.850> like<00:02:46.690> the<00:02:46.720> Arduino

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
extra chips like the like the Arduino

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.860 
extra chips like the like the Arduino
does<00:02:47.680> which<00:02:47.890> uses<00:02:48.190> the<00:02:48.310> same<00:02:48.340> sort<00:02:48.790> of

OS<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.570> idea<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:20.110> was<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:21.160> plug<00:03:21.880> this<00:03:22.060> thing

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
OS so the idea I was to plug this thing

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.319 
OS so the idea I was to plug this thing
into<00:03:22.450> it<00:03:22.600> into<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.049> PC<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.880> write<00:03:24.880> a<00:03:24.910> filing

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
into it into a PC and write a filing

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
system ROM on the BBC micro which would

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.319 
system ROM on the BBC micro which would
rather<00:03:28.690> than<00:03:29.610> sending<00:03:30.610> the<00:03:30.760> data<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:31.299> a

rather than sending the data to a
physical<00:03:31.900> disk<00:03:32.079> drive<00:03:32.320> it<00:03:32.620> would<00:03:32.769> send<00:03:33.010> it

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
physical disk drive it would send it

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:41.690

traditional BBC micro with a disk drive
rather<00:03:58.989> than<00:03:59.230> make<00:03:59.410> stuff<00:03:59.709> you<00:03:59.860> DFS<00:04:00.340> it<00:04:00.519> would

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
rather than make stuff you DFS it would

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.110 
rather than make stuff you DFS it would
say<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:00.820> con<00:04:01.180> DFS<00:04:01.690> or<00:04:01.959> similar<00:04:02.760> so<00:04:03.760> on<00:04:03.940> this

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
say a con DFS or similar so on this

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.750 
say a con DFS or similar so on this
machine<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:05.049> DFS<00:04:05.980> calls<00:04:06.250> have<00:04:06.400> all<00:04:06.549> been

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.580 
machine the DFS calls have all been
rebooted<00:04:07.120> so<00:04:07.570> rather<00:04:07.780> than<00:04:08.019> writing<00:04:08.230> to<00:04:08.560> a

physical<00:04:08.980> disk<00:04:09.250> they<00:04:10.180> just<00:04:10.420> send<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:11.109> data

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.039 
protocol to to this to this
microcontroller<00:04:17.549> so<00:04:18.690> let's<00:04:19.690> give<00:04:19.840> it<00:04:19.870> a<00:04:19.930> go

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
microcontroller so let's give it a go

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:21.390 
microcontroller so let's give it a go
I'll<00:04:20.560> plug<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.859> in<00:04:20.919> this<00:04:21.010> way

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
I'll plug it in this way

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:25.909 
I'll plug it in this way
PC<00:04:22.290> hopefully<00:04:23.290> I<00:04:23.320> can<00:04:23.470> show<00:04:23.770> you<00:04:23.830> how<00:04:24.040> it<00:04:24.460> works

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
PC hopefully I can show you how it works

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:30.420 
PC hopefully I can show you how it works
so<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.949> plug<00:04:27.310> it<00:04:27.430> in<00:04:27.610> and<00:04:27.880> PC<00:04:28.720> does<00:04:29.620> the<00:04:29.800> beat<00:04:30.100> to

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
so I plug it in and PC does the beat to

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.310 
so I plug it in and PC does the beat to
show<00:04:31.120> that<00:04:31.300> it's<00:04:31.979> accepted<00:04:32.979> it<00:04:34.470> and<00:04:36.000> on<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.630> PC

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:38.320 
show that it's accepted it and on the PC

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.010 
show that it's accepted it and on the PC
I<00:04:38.889> have<00:04:39.250> this<00:04:39.550> little<00:04:40.090> program<00:04:40.539> here<00:04:40.570> which

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
I have this little program here which

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.620 
I have this little program here which
I've<00:04:41.229> written<00:04:41.620> and<00:04:41.889> this<00:04:42.520> is<00:04:42.699> Windows<00:04:43.120> but<00:04:43.449> I

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:43.630 
I've written and this is Windows but I

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.420 
I've written and this is Windows but I
have<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:45.310> have<00:04:45.880> this<00:04:46.300> code<00:04:46.570> built<00:04:46.840> on<00:04:47.190> Linux<00:04:48.190> and

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:48.430 
have I have this code built on Linux and

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:51.749 
have I have this code built on Linux and
Mac<00:04:48.910> OS<00:04:49.060> also<00:04:50.130> so<00:04:51.130> it's<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.280> little<00:04:51.460> program

00:04:51.749 --> 00:04:51.759 
Mac OS also so it's a little program

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.610 
Mac OS also so it's a little program
that<00:04:51.789> is<00:04:52.150> basically<00:04:52.690> it's<00:04:53.139> basically<00:04:53.350> like<00:04:53.560> a

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:53.620 
that is basically it's basically like a

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.860 
that is basically it's basically like a
file<00:04:53.889> server<00:04:54.160> it'll<00:04:54.910> just<00:04:55.120> sit<00:04:55.270> there<00:04:55.449> waiting

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
file server it'll just sit there waiting

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.120 
file server it'll just sit there waiting
for<00:04:56.580> disk<00:04:57.810> requests<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:59.530> come<00:04:59.710> in<00:04:59.830> from<00:05:00.039> the

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
for disk requests to come in from the

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.240 
for disk requests to come in from the
BBC<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:00.880> when<00:05:01.720> they<00:05:01.930> do<00:05:01.990> then<00:05:02.500> it<00:05:02.800> will<00:05:02.949> serve

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
BBC and when they do then it will serve

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.640 
BBC and when they do then it will serve
them<00:05:03.520> serve<00:05:04.180> them<00:05:04.360> up<00:05:04.479> from<00:05:04.780> its<00:05:04.960> local<00:05:05.169> disk

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
them serve them up from its local disk

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:08.330 
them serve them up from its local disk
imager<00:05:06.070> I've<00:05:06.250> supplied<00:05:06.699> on<00:05:06.940> the<00:05:07.030> command<00:05:07.300> line

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
imager I've supplied on the command line

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.939 
imager I've supplied on the command line
so<00:05:09.340> right<00:05:09.699> now<00:05:09.880> it's<00:05:10.810> behaving<00:05:11.289> as<00:05:11.440> if<00:05:11.470> there

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:11.949 
so right now it's behaving as if there

00:05:11.949 --> 00:05:15.810 
so right now it's behaving as if there
was<00:05:12.130> a<00:05:12.880> floppy<00:05:13.449> disk<00:05:13.750> with<00:05:13.960> exile<00:05:14.560> again<00:05:15.250> from

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:15.820 
was a floppy disk with exile again from

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.810 
was a floppy disk with exile again from
the<00:05:16.000> late<00:05:16.300> 80s<00:05:16.919> present<00:05:17.919> so<00:05:18.070> if<00:05:18.160> I<00:05:18.250> just<00:05:18.460> press

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:18.820 
the late 80s present so if I just press

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:21.120 
the late 80s present so if I just press
shift<00:05:19.060> break<00:05:19.330> it<00:05:20.050> will<00:05:20.259> load<00:05:20.620> the<00:05:20.770> game<00:05:20.949> and

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.130 
shift break it will load the game and

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:23.159 
shift break it will load the game and
you<00:05:21.220> see<00:05:21.280> whatever<00:05:21.610> the<00:05:21.789> the<00:05:22.449> disk<00:05:22.690> drive<00:05:22.930> is

00:05:23.159 --> 00:05:23.169 
you see whatever the the disk drive is

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:28.050 
you see whatever the the disk drive is
accessed<00:05:24.180> some<00:05:25.180> of<00:05:25.360> these<00:05:26.070> reblock<00:05:27.070> log<00:05:27.789> lines

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
accessed some of these reblock log lines

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:31.529 
accessed some of these reblock log lines
will<00:05:28.300> appear<00:05:28.599> on<00:05:28.630> the<00:05:28.840> screen<00:05:29.760> so<00:05:30.760> it<00:05:31.150> starts

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
will appear on the screen so it starts

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.330 
will appear on the screen so it starts
the<00:05:31.630> game<00:05:31.780> it's<00:05:32.020> it's<00:05:32.320> very<00:05:32.560> much<00:05:32.770> faster<00:05:32.979> than

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:33.340 
the game it's it's very much faster than

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:36.330 
the game it's it's very much faster than
an<00:05:33.460> original<00:05:33.940> disk<00:05:34.630> drive<00:05:34.870> as<00:05:35.080> well<00:05:35.260> and<00:05:36.070> very

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
an original disk drive as well and very

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.770 
an original disk drive as well and very
much<00:05:36.460> quieter<00:05:39.419> so<00:05:40.419> there's<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.930> game<00:05:41.550> you<00:05:42.550> can

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:42.780 
much quieter so there's the game you can

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:46.870 
much quieter so there's the game you can
make<00:05:43.780> uh<00:05:43.900> trim<00:05:44.080> what<00:05:44.260> the<00:05:44.349> keys<00:05:44.530> are

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:48.460 

so<00:05:47.360> you<00:05:47.450> play<00:05:47.600> that<00:05:47.720> for<00:05:47.930> a<00:05:47.960> while<00:05:48.080> and<00:05:48.380> when

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:48.470 
so you play that for a while and when

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:50.950 
so you play that for a while and when
you<00:05:48.560> get<00:05:48.680> when<00:05:49.100> you<00:05:49.190> get<00:05:49.340> bored<00:05:49.580> of<00:05:49.670> that<00:05:49.960> you

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
you get when you get bored of that you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.220 
you get when you get bored of that you
can<00:05:51.230> just<00:05:52.100> switch<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.370> a<00:05:52.550> different<00:05:52.940> game<00:05:53.230> so

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:54.230 
can just switch to a different game so

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:57.610 
can just switch to a different game so
ctrl<00:05:54.590> C<00:05:54.830> and<00:05:55.160> I<00:05:55.990> select<00:05:56.990> a<00:05:57.140> different<00:05:57.290> game

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
ctrl C and I select a different game

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.270 
ctrl C and I select a different game
this<00:05:57.770> time<00:05:57.830> I'm<00:05:58.160> going<00:05:58.310> to<00:05:58.400> select<00:05:58.520> elite<00:05:59.230> this

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:00.280 
this time I'm going to select elite this

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:02.890 
this time I'm going to select elite this
this<00:06:01.280> elite<00:06:01.640> is<00:06:01.820> actually<00:06:02.180> a<00:06:02.210> hacked<00:06:02.780> version

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
this elite is actually a hacked version

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.140 
this elite is actually a hacked version
of<00:06:03.260> elite<00:06:03.530> written<00:06:03.830> by<00:06:03.980> a<00:06:04.220> guy<00:06:04.670> called<00:06:04.730> Angus

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:05.150 
of elite written by a guy called Angus

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:08.080 
of elite written by a guy called Angus
Duggan<00:06:05.570> so<00:06:06.440> it's<00:06:06.560> not<00:06:06.680> the<00:06:06.800> original<00:06:07.090> and

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.090 
Duggan so it's not the original and

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:11.380 
Duggan so it's not the original and
modified<00:06:09.050> version<00:06:09.440> of<00:06:09.530> elite<00:06:10.060> but<00:06:11.060> for<00:06:11.330> the

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:11.390 
modified version of elite but for the

00:06:11.390 --> 00:06:15.250 
modified version of elite but for the
purposes<00:06:11.810> of<00:06:11.930> this<00:06:12.080> demo<00:06:12.380> it's<00:06:13.840> it's<00:06:14.840> the<00:06:15.020> same

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:15.260 
purposes of this demo it's it's the same

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.190 
purposes of this demo it's it's the same
ok<00:06:16.130> so<00:06:16.190> again<00:06:16.940> if<00:06:17.390> break<00:06:17.630> and<00:06:17.870> it<00:06:17.930> will<00:06:18.050> just

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
ok so again if break and it will just

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.010 
ok so again if break and it will just
boot<00:06:18.800> into<00:06:19.010> the<00:06:19.160> into<00:06:19.790> the<00:06:19.880> game<00:06:20.060> and<00:06:20.810> one<00:06:20.930> of

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:21.020 
boot into the into the game and one of

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.360 
boot into the into the game and one of
the<00:06:21.080> interesting<00:06:21.170> things<00:06:21.620> about<00:06:21.710> elite<00:06:22.130> is

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
the interesting things about elite is

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.680 
the interesting things about elite is
that<00:06:22.610> it<00:06:22.760> uses<00:06:23.420> a<00:06:24.760> it<00:06:25.760> uses<00:06:26.120> an<00:06:26.210> overlay<00:06:26.390> system

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
that it uses a it uses an overlay system

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.510 
that it uses a it uses an overlay system
so<00:06:27.230> rather<00:06:27.470> than<00:06:27.650> loading<00:06:27.980> all<00:06:28.130> of<00:06:28.160> the<00:06:28.340> ball

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:28.520 
so rather than loading all of the ball

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.800 
so rather than loading all of the ball
of<00:06:28.670> the<00:06:28.760> code<00:06:28.940> into<00:06:29.150> the<00:06:29.240> memory<00:06:29.360> at<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:29.600> same

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:29.810 
of the code into the memory at the same

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:33.160 
of the code into the memory at the same
time<00:06:30.050> it<00:06:30.680> will<00:06:31.030> load<00:06:32.030> extra<00:06:32.660> bits<00:06:32.840> of<00:06:32.990> code

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:33.170 
time it will load extra bits of code

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:44.030 
to leaving the space station and flying

00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:46.510 
to leaving the space station and flying
away<00:06:44.150> and<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:45.170> will<00:06:45.290> load<00:06:45.560> some<00:06:45.800> extra<00:06:46.310> data

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:46.520 
away and it will load some extra data

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.490 
away and it will load some extra data
from<00:06:46.850> the<00:06:47.090> disk<00:06:47.330> and<00:06:47.600> you<00:06:47.990> can<00:06:48.140> see<00:06:48.320> that

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:48.500 
from the disk and you can see that

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:54.570 
from the disk and you can see that
appearing<00:06:49.310> here<00:06:49.580> when<00:06:49.910> I<00:06:49.940> launch<00:06:52.270> into<00:06:53.270> orbit

so<00:06:55.580> that's<00:06:55.910> it

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:56.830 
so that's it
