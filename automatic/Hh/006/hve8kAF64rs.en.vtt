to<00:01:31.920> train<00:01:32.189> educate<00:01:32.579> local<00:01:33.119> people<00:01:33.659> they

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
to train educate local people they

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.739 
to train educate local people they
coexist<00:01:35.189> with<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.490> cheetah<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.209> they<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.600> to

00:01:36.739 --> 00:01:36.749 
coexist with the cheetah so they have to

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:39.139 
coexist with the cheetah so they have to
be<00:01:36.869> satisfied<00:01:37.439> and<00:01:37.709> convinced<00:01:38.310> convinced<00:01:39.060> to

co-exist<00:01:40.549> they<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.939> much<00:01:42.240> higher

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
co-exist they have much higher

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.239 
co-exist they have much higher
encounters<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.409> they<00:01:43.529> look<00:01:43.679> at<00:01:43.859> the<00:01:43.950> people

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:44.249 
encounters that they look at the people

00:01:44.249 --> 00:01:46.580 
encounters that they look at the people
in<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.459> cities<00:01:44.789> so<00:01:45.029> they<00:01:45.600> need<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.020> be<00:01:46.139> trained

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
in the cities so they need to be trained

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.789 
in the cities so they need to be trained
they<00:01:46.859> need<00:01:47.069> to<00:01:47.219> be<00:01:47.479> recognized<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:49.289> recognize

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
they need to be recognized to recognize

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.889 
they need to be recognized to recognize
the<00:01:49.979> cheetah<00:01:50.219> from<00:01:50.819> other<00:01:50.999> animals<00:01:51.509> because

the cheetah from other animals because

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.529 
the cheetah from other animals because
the<00:01:52.170> cheetah<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.709> rarely<00:01:53.159> killed<00:01:53.909> domestic

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
animals and most of the time they

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.120 
animals and most of the time they
confuse<00:01:57.420> it<00:01:57.569> with<00:01:57.599> other<00:01:57.959> animals<00:01:58.469> which<00:01:58.979> is

the<00:02:24.680> camera<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:26.140> we<00:02:27.140> put<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> camera<00:02:27.980> traps

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
the camera and we put the camera traps

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.190 
the camera and we put the camera traps
in<00:02:28.550> various<00:02:29.210> parts<00:02:29.540> of<00:02:29.630> the<00:02:29.750> cheetah<00:02:29.990> habitat

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
in various parts of the cheetah habitat

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.950 
in various parts of the cheetah habitat
and<00:02:30.650> after<00:02:30.950> one<00:02:31.250> to<00:02:31.580> three<00:02:31.910> months<00:02:32.210> we<00:02:32.600> collect

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
and after one to three months we collect

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:35.590 
and after one to three months we collect
all<00:02:33.260> of<00:02:33.470> them<00:02:33.650> and<00:02:33.830> then<00:02:34.490> we<00:02:34.910> compare<00:02:35.240> the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
all of them and then we compare the

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.240 
all of them and then we compare the
cheetah<00:02:35.840> pictures<00:02:36.320> because<00:02:36.650> each<00:02:36.890> cheetah

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
cheetah pictures because each cheetah

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:39.280 
cheetah pictures because each cheetah
has<00:02:37.520> a<00:02:37.550> unique<00:02:38.030> spot<00:02:38.360> patterns<00:02:38.840> like<00:02:39.260> a

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
has a unique spot patterns like a

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.430 
has a unique spot patterns like a
fingerprint<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.160> humans<00:02:40.550> so<00:02:41.270> we<00:02:41.600> can<00:02:41.810> compare

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
fingerprint in humans so we can compare

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.800 
fingerprint in humans so we can compare
and<00:02:42.710> conclude<00:02:43.700> that<00:02:43.730> how<00:02:44.120> many<00:02:44.180> cheetahs<00:02:44.660> are

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
and conclude that how many cheetahs are

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.160 
and conclude that how many cheetahs are
in<00:02:45.320> this<00:02:45.440> areas<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.240> from<00:02:47.240> which<00:02:47.510> ages<00:02:47.960> and

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
in this areas and from which ages and

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.860 
in this areas and from which ages and
from<00:02:48.290> which<00:02:48.650> fixes<00:02:49.310> so<00:02:50.030> this<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.480> one<00:02:50.660> of<00:02:50.750> the

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
from which fixes so this is one of the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.810 
from which fixes so this is one of the
most<00:02:51.050> important<00:02:51.650> works<00:02:52.070> and<00:02:52.340> on<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.730> other

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
most important works and on the other

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.900 
most important works and on the other
hand<00:02:53.120> we<00:02:53.870> do<00:02:54.050> various<00:02:54.590> ecological<00:02:54.920> surveys<00:02:55.670> on

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
hand we do various ecological surveys on

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.570 
hand we do various ecological surveys on

know<00:03:02.600> direct<00:03:03.110> observation<00:03:03.830> so<00:03:04.400> all<00:03:04.760> of<00:03:05.060> them

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:05.270

much better about the cheetahs and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.780 
much better about the cheetahs and

thinking<00:06:51.699> is<00:06:51.819> that<00:06:51.849> we<00:06:52.270> can<00:06:53.699> secure<00:06:54.699> the

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:55.150 
thinking is that we can secure the

00:06:55.150 --> 00:06:57.330 
thinking is that we can secure the
future<00:06:55.449> of<00:06:55.689> the<00:06:55.960> cheetahs<00:06:56.319> in<00:06:56.349> Iran<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:57.039> even

00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:57.340 
future of the cheetahs in Iran and even

00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.339 
future of the cheetahs in Iran and even
healthy<00:06:57.879> other<00:06:58.029> countries<00:06:58.599> so<00:06:59.259> is

00:06:59.339 --> 00:06:59.349 
healthy other countries so is

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.450 
healthy other countries so is
reestablish<00:07:00.219> or<00:07:00.460> actually<00:07:01.090> recolonize<00:07:01.659> the

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:02.460 
reestablish or actually recolonize the

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.800 
reestablish or actually recolonize the
extinct<00:07:03.460> populations<00:07:04.150> across<00:07:04.539> its

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:04.810 
extinct populations across its

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.260 
extinct populations across its
historical<00:07:05.560> range<00:07:05.830> this<00:07:06.520> is<00:07:06.639> another<00:07:06.879> story

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:07.270 
historical range this is another story

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.519 
historical range this is another story
but<00:07:07.569> for<00:07:08.110> Iran<00:07:08.469> I<00:07:08.710> think<00:07:08.860> that<00:07:09.279> we<00:07:09.789> can<00:07:10.060> say<00:07:11.050> we

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:11.529 
but for Iran I think that we can say we

00:07:11.529 --> 00:07:14.070 
but for Iran I think that we can say we
can<00:07:11.560> reach<00:07:11.919> to<00:07:12.460> a<00:07:12.729> stabilized<00:07:13.330> number<00:07:13.810> of<00:07:13.960> the

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:14.080 
can reach to a stabilized number of the

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.290 
can reach to a stabilized number of the
cheetahs<00:07:14.409> in<00:07:14.439> Iran<00:07:14.830> but<00:07:15.430> what<00:07:15.969> is<00:07:16.120> so

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:16.300 
cheetahs in Iran but what is so

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:18.629 
cheetahs in Iran but what is so
important<00:07:16.870> is<00:07:17.050> that<00:07:17.080> all<00:07:17.500> the<00:07:18.069> people<00:07:18.400> in<00:07:18.550> this

00:07:18.629 --> 00:07:18.639 
important is that all the people in this

00:07:18.639 --> 00:07:21.059 
important is that all the people in this
country<00:07:18.849> from<00:07:19.569> government<00:07:20.139> to<00:07:20.349> local<00:07:20.560> people

00:07:21.059 --> 00:07:21.069 
country from government to local people

00:07:21.069 --> 00:07:23.969 
country from government to local people
they<00:07:21.430> have<00:07:21.729> to<00:07:21.969> be<00:07:22.259> trained<00:07:23.259> they<00:07:23.620> need<00:07:23.830> to

00:07:23.969 --> 00:07:23.979 
they have to be trained they need to

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:27.480 
they have to be trained they need to
learn<00:07:24.159> that<00:07:24.759> this<00:07:25.330> is<00:07:25.689> a<00:07:25.810> small<00:07:26.080> population<00:07:26.490> so

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:27.490 
learn that this is a small population so

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.939 
learn that this is a small population so
if<00:07:27.819> we<00:07:28.240> fragment<00:07:28.810> their<00:07:28.960> populations<00:07:29.680> their

00:07:29.939 --> 00:07:29.949 
if we fragment their populations their

00:07:29.949 --> 00:07:31.800 
if we fragment their populations their
habitat<00:07:30.460> so<00:07:30.729> there<00:07:31.000> is<00:07:31.060> no<00:07:31.180> future<00:07:31.449> for<00:07:31.599> the

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:31.810 
habitat so there is no future for the

00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:34.110 
habitat so there is no future for the
cheetahs<00:07:32.289> so<00:07:32.919> there<00:07:33.099> is<00:07:33.189> no<00:07:33.279> for<00:07:33.490> it<00:07:33.580> not<00:07:33.939> only

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
cheetahs so there is no for it not only

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.119 
cheetahs so there is no for it not only
for<00:07:34.360> Iran<00:07:34.689> for<00:07:35.080> all<00:07:35.289> of<00:07:35.409> the<00:07:35.529> world<00:07:35.740> because

00:07:36.119 --> 00:07:36.129 
for Iran for all of the world because

00:07:36.129 --> 00:07:37.860 
for Iran for all of the world because
there's<00:07:36.520> no<00:07:36.669> Asia<00:07:36.939> to<00:07:37.150> cheetah<00:07:37.449> anymore<00:07:37.750> in

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
there's no Asia to cheetah anymore in

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:40.169 
there's no Asia to cheetah anymore in
the<00:07:37.960> world
