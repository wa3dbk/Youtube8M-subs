00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.380
 a little 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.170
 when you imagine the possession happens, you think it will come 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.260
 to happen 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.580
 already thought 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.760
 with me with my foot and six months to go out of the most holy

 You will meet in the course of our grandparents. 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.150
 but let's do the maximum 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.629
 rely on the seriousness of the Brazilian 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.149
 the events movements they understand that the trade union movement 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:08.029

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.860
 before crisis 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.930
 Are you thinking that everything started? 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.540
 before and after winning 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.930
 It's a long time before our time marking 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.060
 it appears from the caves as the recorded one that is not reviewed in the interior 

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.440
 6th and Sat sometimes I think we need to remove the dem through the streets 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.850
 sena 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.700
 as an alternative 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.030
 in graphite for example all wings computerized annually to caves 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.450
 necessary that he wanted it to come the need for home survival 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.810
 then appeared was in series b 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.770
 need more wanted 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.170
 being in this emergency situation 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.680
 I do not know what we have here from the oldest pre-salt tn was given at 6 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.799
 of the afternoon the 40 thousand to 30 thousand years 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.300
 we then marina appears next to the barca 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.389
 scored a goal 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:10.459
 Flemish today 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.749
 to seven years in jail for manslaughter 

00:02:13.749 --> 00:02:17.129
 this mental deficiency 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:22.200
 also has the head this outcome with all of us can already have 

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:25.229
 identified with what we know 

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:26.129
 now it's law 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:29.490
 highlight on the outside you want to try to kill 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.239
 to run for the post 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:32.579
 this vision 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.700
 obviously 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.040
 now the question 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.519
 for nicolau that they built in paris on the wall of the caves 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:43.859
 looks at the need for an agency that is this date of the sentence 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.619
 our investigations are made from a need 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.939
 for the need to talk about survival thesis 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:58.359
 the state if we took interest excited her thought strategies to sacrifice the 

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:00.489
 receiving air in one of them 

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:03.419
 next year i was already a desire from your past 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.669
 more than 40,000 students parents and teachers of French advanced in this 

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:12.989
 week a cow for example to process the recent does not enter 

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:17.310
 No one in my house, my part. 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.810
 if we can not win we need to have the transaction 

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.259
 by the schengen treaty 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:27.029
 Terezinha does not look better in December but such observation 

00:03:27.689 --> 00:03:30.939
 why our memories of the victims of the disease pass away will persist 

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:33.529
 existence of margins 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:38.879
 and who to use me were these drove the wind and coal companies 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.119
 it is the technique itself attentive referees because we have session date 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.560
 they are afraid even if they are part 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.699
 lewis amselem 

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:49.600
 preferences 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.759
 Dreams in one's leg 

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.349
 frize blood 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.159
 also optimize operations 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:00.489
 also if the wounds are the seeds for example that we go 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.489
 find our reserves and indigenous lands that also use news 

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.439
 a lot of these seeds 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:08.739
 there is no control 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.629
 they claim that he would 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.889
 interim leaving his registration on the walls of the adolescent caves 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.069
 it is worth remembering that we have here with this controversial theme that this amount 

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:24.029
 Coina is a good idea. 

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:26.999
 we will also realize that he 

00:04:26.999 --> 00:04:30.619
 had already had an idea that the foreground expectation 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:36.069
 despite being mostly civilian majority first artist revelation plane 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:38.539
 of details 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.600
 we also want pictures of loose horses 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:46.539
 the exception is the second improvement plan in the second year of your return to 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:49.539
 their homes perspective 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.800
 this year is also a feature of sea tock 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.360
 I personally made up to this day have a mystical vision in the holy place 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.030
 antônio 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.439
 the problem that it was a child who was in his 20s 

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:05.159
 within today 

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:10.179
 saying that he must be here and the death of his great-great-grandfather's 

00:05:10.179 --> 00:05:13.289
 survival and what would happen 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.449
 That's why many say they 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.050
 found in the wall of the arteries 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.750
 on spears sacrificing 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.760
 thinking about a bike that had a bit of this 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.530
 refers to the creation of tips to think the team has referred to is common 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.870
 to happen 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.070
 but before you think 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.539
 and in reflecting on contention and incidents and jutí record 

00:05:37.539 --> 00:05:41.270
 something that we have to this day after advancing to the Round of 16 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.259
 you are also speaking but you will be registered in the database one 

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:47.060
 thing 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.319
 as much as we have 

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.279
 the computer and technology but we do not need you 

00:05:53.029 --> 00:05:54.169
 the lack 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:55.229
 a little note 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.099
 in a bush 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.399
 is our memory is the memory that will tell the story if it were not 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:06.520
 this injury preservation requirement should be this information 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.720
 here is a work of the archaeologist who is the professional who will research 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:13.020
 these regions 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.319
 come and go, make squares difficult 

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:18.369
 rapporteur for the matter aldo 

00:06:18.369 --> 00:06:21.789
 along with handicrafts against paulo 

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.660
 this one to identify 

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:31.840
 the emblem the culture the species to cheer hall ukraine launched and there six 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:36.350
 equipment and care to preserve the history are they are the 

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:40.400
 prepare discovered processes that then guarantee all information 

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:46.780
 - this reminds us that we already start in the room - this is the thesis that our 

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:50.949
 life is also part of the trends that we are accumulating this is a 

00:06:50.949 --> 00:06:51.159
 from them
