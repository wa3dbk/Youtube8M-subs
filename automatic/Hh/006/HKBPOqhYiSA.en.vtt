00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:21.480 
which mode do I change to mode 3 because

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.070 
which mode do I change to mode 3 because
that<00:01:21.660> makes<00:01:21.870> you've<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.200> lot<00:01:22.320> o<00:01:22.380> invincible

this<00:02:22.410> version<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.860> the<00:02:22.890> Kapow<00:02:24.410> well<00:02:25.410> when

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
this version with the Kapow well when

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.380 
this version with the Kapow well when
you<00:02:25.890> die<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.160> actually<00:02:26.730> progresses<00:02:27.180> you<00:02:27.270> to

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
you die it actually progresses you to
