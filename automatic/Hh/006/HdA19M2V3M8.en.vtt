remove<00:03:42.959> the<00:03:43.230> sticker<00:03:43.530> if<00:03:43.709> we<00:03:43.830> can<00:03:46.700> get<00:03:47.700> that

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
remove the sticker if we can get that

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.020 
remove the sticker if we can get that
out<00:03:47.940> of<00:03:48.120> there<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.600> think<00:03:49.610> stick<00:03:50.610> that<00:03:50.790> over

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
out of there I think stick that over

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.259 
out of there I think stick that over
there<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.959> then<00:03:52.080> what<00:03:52.230> we'll<00:03:52.320> do<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:53.040> take<00:03:53.430> and

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269
