00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:13.880 
your kayak stupid

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.010 
your kayak stupid
but<00:02:14.880> you're<00:02:15.000> going<00:02:15.150> to<00:02:15.300> eventually<00:02:15.630> have<00:02:15.870> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
but you're going to eventually have to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.410 
but you're going to eventually have to
learn<00:02:16.260> this<00:02:16.470> anyway<00:02:16.920> while<00:02:17.790> Aaron<00:02:18.090> muscle

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
learn this anyway while Aaron muscle

learn this anyway while Aaron muscle
memory<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.780> a<00:02:18.810> paddle<00:02:19.110> float<00:02:19.350> and<00:02:19.680> then<00:02:20.130> have

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
memory with a paddle float and then have

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.640 
memory with a paddle float and then have
to<00:02:20.490> relearn<00:02:20.760> it<00:02:20.820> with<00:02:21.060> bracing<00:02:21.510> using<00:02:22.500> the

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to relearn it with bracing using the

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.130 
to relearn it with bracing using the
bracing<00:02:23.160> technique<00:02:23.640> will<00:02:24.030> actually<00:02:24.630> help<00:02:24.870> you

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
bracing technique will actually help you

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.070 
bracing technique will actually help you
with<00:02:25.620> stability<00:02:26.250> it'll<00:02:27.180> help<00:02:27.330> you<00:02:27.570> with<00:02:27.900> your

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
with stability it'll help you with your

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.530 
with stability it'll help you with your
sweep<00:02:28.350> roll<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:29.430> gets<00:02:29.700> you<00:02:29.850> out<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:30.060> the<00:02:30.270> cold

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
sweep roll it gets you out of the cold

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.600 
sweep roll it gets you out of the cold
water<00:02:30.990> much<00:02:31.440> faster<00:02:31.950> than<00:02:32.070> a<00:02:32.130> paddle<00:02:32.490> float

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
water much faster than a paddle float

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.660 
water much faster than a paddle float
and<00:02:32.940> it's<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.960> plain<00:02:34.350> efficient<00:02:35.010> something

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
and it's just plain efficient something

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.000 
and it's just plain efficient something
we<00:02:35.790> all<00:02:36.060> can<00:02:36.090> appreciate<00:02:36.710> so<00:02:37.710> why<00:02:37.860> not

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
we all can appreciate so why not

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.100 
we all can appreciate so why not
practice<00:02:38.490> this<00:02:38.820> re-entry<00:02:39.480> technique<00:02:39.900> and

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
practice this re-entry technique and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.040 
practice this re-entry technique and
leave<00:02:40.380> your<00:02:40.530> paddle<00:02:40.890> float<00:02:40.980> on<00:02:41.250> the<00:02:41.490> foredeck

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
leave your paddle float on the foredeck

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.140 
leave your paddle float on the foredeck
