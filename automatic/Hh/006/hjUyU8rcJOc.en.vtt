LED<00:02:41.060> lights<00:02:41.330> one<00:02:41.570> of<00:02:41.690> them's<00:02:41.810> an<00:02:42.020> orange<00:02:42.320> color

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
LED lights one of them's an orange color

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.220 
LED lights one of them's an orange color
the<00:02:43.340> other<00:02:43.490> one<00:02:43.670> is<00:02:43.700> your<00:02:43.940> usual<00:02:44.180> white<00:02:44.630> LED

the other one is your usual white LED

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.930 
the other one is your usual white LED
now<00:02:45.440> that's<00:02:45.680> so<00:02:46.100> that<00:02:46.250> when<00:02:46.340> it<00:02:46.370> flashes<00:02:46.820> on

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
now that's so that when it flashes on

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.970 
now that's so that when it flashes on
skin<00:02:47.300> tones<00:02:47.570> it<00:02:48.230> will<00:02:48.380> give<00:02:48.590> you<00:02:48.710> a<00:02:48.770> much<00:02:48.920> more

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
skin tones it will give you a much more

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
skin tones it will give you a much more
natural<00:02:49.600> result<00:02:50.890> 8<00:02:51.890> megapixel<00:02:52.520> camera<00:02:52.850> but

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
natural result 8 megapixel camera but

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.520 
natural result 8 megapixel camera but
obviously<00:02:53.240> the<00:02:53.420> sensors<00:02:53.810> a<00:02:53.840> lot<00:02:54.050> bigger<00:02:54.260> so

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
obviously the sensors a lot bigger so

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.110 
obviously the sensors a lot bigger so
you<00:02:54.590> should<00:02:54.860> capture<00:02:55.160> more<00:02:55.460> light<00:02:55.520> and<00:02:55.700> create

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
you should capture more light and create

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.710 
you should capture more light and create
better<00:02:56.330> images<00:02:57.520> simin<00:02:58.520> sim<00:02:58.850> tray<00:02:59.270> comes<00:02:59.540> out

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
better images simin sim tray comes out

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.270 
better images simin sim tray comes out

there<00:03:57.950> straight<00:03:58.430> away<00:03:58.550> now<00:03:58.880> though<00:03:59.090> plenty<00:03:59.660> of

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
there straight away now though plenty of

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.630 
there straight away now though plenty of
rumors<00:04:00.080> as<00:04:00.230> to<00:04:00.260> why<00:04:00.530> they<00:04:00.709> decided<00:04:00.890> to<00:04:01.280> go<00:04:01.430> for

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
rumors as to why they decided to go for

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.880 
rumors as to why they decided to go for
grey<00:04:01.880> one<00:04:02.600> of<00:04:02.750> them<00:04:02.870> perhaps<00:04:03.080> was<00:04:03.500> that<00:04:03.680> it<00:04:03.770> was

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:03.890 
grey one of them perhaps was that it was

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:05.500 
grey one of them perhaps was that it was
just<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:04.220> easy<00:04:04.459> to<00:04:04.700> scratch<00:04:04.970> you'll<00:04:05.209> see<00:04:05.390> I've

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
just so easy to scratch you'll see I've

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.510 
just so easy to scratch you'll see I've
got<00:04:05.540> a<00:04:05.720> couple<00:04:05.959> of<00:04:06.140> mine<00:04:06.380> already<00:04:06.590> and

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
got a couple of mine already and

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.340 
got a couple of mine already and
hopefully<00:04:07.700> the<00:04:08.030> grey<00:04:08.209> one<00:04:08.420> won't<00:04:08.690> be<00:04:08.900> as<00:04:09.050> prone

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
hopefully the grey one won't be as prone

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.560 
hopefully the grey one won't be as prone
to<00:04:09.560> scratching<00:04:10.040> off<00:04:10.220> but<00:04:11.000> you<00:04:11.030> see<00:04:11.209> the<00:04:11.330> color

to scratching off but you see the color
is<00:04:11.810> different<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.590> regardless<00:04:13.459> of<00:04:13.700> the

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
is different and regardless of the

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.760 
is different and regardless of the
reasons<00:04:14.209> for<00:04:14.270> it<00:04:14.600> it<00:04:14.720> will<00:04:14.959> help<00:04:15.230> people<00:04:15.620> to

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:15.770 
reasons for it it will help people to
