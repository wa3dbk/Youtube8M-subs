00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
around 81 or 82 so my defense wasn't

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:36.080 
around 81 or 82 so my defense wasn't

real ultimate team I would probably try

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.230 
real ultimate team I would probably try
to<00:02:40.110> get<00:02:40.830> another<00:02:41.040> player<00:02:41.340> card<00:02:41.670> and<00:02:41.910> released

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
Taylor Hall and Mason Raymond just so I

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.780 
Taylor Hall and Mason Raymond just so I
can<00:02:48.390> get<00:02:48.960> a<00:02:49.020> defenseman<00:02:49.620> because<00:02:50.460> you<00:02:50.550> kind<00:02:50.760> of

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
can get a defenseman because you kind of

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.220 
can get a defenseman because you kind of
want<00:02:51.000> to<00:02:51.060> structure<00:02:51.360> your<00:02:51.510> team<00:02:51.840> in<00:02:51.990> a<00:02:52.080> way

that<00:02:52.500> you<00:02:53.010> know<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.370> whole<00:02:53.550> body<00:02:53.850> team<00:02:54.150> you

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
that you know the whole body team you

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.510 
that you know the whole body team you
don't<00:02:54.930> want<00:02:55.110> to<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.290> a<00:02:55.320> bunch<00:02:55.590> of<00:02:55.709> HL<00:02:56.190> players

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520

playing<00:02:57.480> on<00:02:57.750> your<00:02:57.930> first<00:02:58.230> offensive<00:02:58.800> line

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
playing on your first offensive line

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:01.780 
playing on your first offensive line
then<00:02:59.790> you'll<00:02:59.940> have<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.150> really<00:03:00.600> weak<00:03:00.840> defense

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
then you'll have a really weak defense

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.150 
then you'll have a really weak defense

that perfect slap shot that's what

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.160 
that perfect slap shot that's what
happens<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.680> NHL<00:04:11.160> 12<00:04:11.459> now<00:04:12.360> i'm<00:04:12.570> not<00:04:12.810> sure<00:04:13.140> the

way<00:04:13.470> they<00:04:13.620> do<00:04:13.769> it<00:04:13.920> kind<00:04:14.160> of<00:04:14.280> seems<00:04:14.940> a<00:04:15.150> little

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:15.330 
way they do it kind of seems a little

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:17.750 
way they do it kind of seems a little
bit<00:04:15.540> clunky<00:04:15.870> to<00:04:16.229> me<00:04:16.410> even<00:04:16.830> that<00:04:16.979> if<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.580> guys

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
bit clunky to me even that if the guys

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.659 
bit clunky to me even that if the guys
kind<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.299> around<00:04:18.600> you<00:04:18.919> it<00:04:19.919> kind<00:04:20.130> of<00:04:20.190> locks<00:04:20.459> your

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
kind of around you it kind of locks your

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.850 
kind of around you it kind of locks your
slap<00:04:20.940> shot<00:04:21.209> out<00:04:21.419> for<00:04:21.720> some<00:04:21.900> reason<00:04:22.289> but<00:04:22.590> i

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
slap shot out for some reason but i

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.380 
slap shot out for some reason but i
think<00:04:23.310> that's<00:04:23.460> okay<00:04:23.789> i<00:04:23.820> think<00:04:24.120> it's<00:04:24.240> going<00:04:24.330> to

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:24.390 
think that's okay i think it's going to

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.370 
think that's okay i think it's going to
bring<00:04:24.660> more<00:04:25.020> by

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380

Thomas makes an incredible save on me

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.520 
Thomas makes an incredible save on me
but<00:04:32.040> I<00:04:32.340> believe<00:04:32.610> that<00:04:33.030> was<00:04:33.360> Mason<00:04:34.020> Raymond

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
but I believe that was Mason Raymond

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.760 
but I believe that was Mason Raymond
putting<00:04:34.860> in<00:04:34.950> the<00:04:35.100> the<00:04:35.640> rebound<00:04:36.090> yes<00:04:36.330> it<00:04:36.510> was

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
putting in the the rebound yes it was

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.260 
putting in the the rebound yes it was
and<00:04:37.770> as<00:04:38.100> you<00:04:38.250> can<00:04:38.400> see<00:04:38.430> if<00:04:38.670> you<00:04:38.700> look<00:04:38.910> closely

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
and as you can see if you look closely

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.980 
and as you can see if you look closely
at<00:04:39.570> this<00:04:39.750> refit<00:04:40.230> play<00:04:40.820> it's<00:04:41.820> a<00:04:42.000> pretty<00:04:42.330> smooth

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
at this refit play it's a pretty smooth

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:47.840 
at this refit play it's a pretty smooth
action<00:04:43.760> from<00:04:44.760> the<00:04:44.820> rebound<00:04:45.680> to<00:04:46.730> shooting<00:04:47.730> it

in<00:04:48.000> it<00:04:48.180> it<00:04:48.390> looks<00:04:48.840> real<00:04:49.350> just<00:04:49.830> the<00:04:49.950> way<00:04:50.130> he<00:04:50.430> kind

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
in it it looks real just the way he kind

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.760 
in it it looks real just the way he kind
of<00:04:50.670> brings<00:04:50.970> his<00:04:51.210> stick<00:04:51.540> back<00:04:51.780> and<00:04:52.140> shoots<00:04:52.530> that

popping back into the net it looks way

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.910 
popping back into the net it looks way
more<00:04:56.000> realistic<00:04:57.000> to<00:04:57.210> me<00:04:57.240> and<00:04:57.690> I<00:04:58.410> think<00:04:58.590> you

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
the NHL series I really highly believe

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:20.000 
the NHL series I really highly believe
looking<00:05:18.600> forward<00:05:18.930> to<00:05:19.110> next<00:05:19.320> year<00:05:19.470> and<00:05:19.860> I<00:05:19.950> know

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
looking forward to next year and I know

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.490 
looking forward to next year and I know
it<00:05:20.400> seems<00:05:20.670> kind<00:05:21.120> of<00:05:21.300> silly<00:05:21.570> saying<00:05:22.050> this<00:05:22.260> but<00:05:22.440> I

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
it seems kind of silly saying this but I

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.380 
it seems kind of silly saying this but I
kind<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:22.890> just<00:05:23.340> wanted<00:05:23.640> to<00:05:23.790> add<00:05:23.910> this<00:05:24.180> little

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
kind of just wanted to add this little

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.750 
kind of just wanted to add this little
piece<00:05:24.780> at<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.020> end<00:05:25.380> looking<00:05:26.220> forward<00:05:26.460> to<00:05:26.550> next

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
piece at the end looking forward to next

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.630 
piece at the end looking forward to next
year<00:05:26.940> I<00:05:27.090> think<00:05:27.180> EA<00:05:27.840> really<00:05:28.680> needs<00:05:28.920> to<00:05:29.160> work<00:05:29.400> on

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
year I think EA really needs to work on

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.890 
year I think EA really needs to work on
the<00:05:30.090> whole<00:05:30.270> arena<00:05:30.660> aspect<00:05:31.320> of<00:05:31.440> the<00:05:31.560> game<00:05:31.590> and

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
the whole arena aspect of the game and

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.320 
the whole arena aspect of the game and
arena<00:05:33.900> atmosphere<00:05:34.860> what<00:05:35.490> I<00:05:35.520> mean<00:05:35.730> by<00:05:35.790> this<00:05:35.970> is

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
arena atmosphere what I mean by this is

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:37.550 
arena atmosphere what I mean by this is
I<00:05:36.360> think<00:05:36.480> they<00:05:36.780> need<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.080> add<00:05:37.200> more

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
I think they need to add more

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.940 
I think they need to add more
interactive<00:05:38.340> fans<00:05:39.110> right<00:05:40.110> now<00:05:40.380> when<00:05:40.710> you<00:05:40.800> look

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
interactive fans right now when you look

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.860 
interactive fans right now when you look
at<00:05:41.040> the<00:05:41.130> fans<00:05:41.430> sometimes<00:05:41.910> you<00:05:42.240> see<00:05:42.420> the<00:05:42.570> same

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
at the fans sometimes you see the same

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.840 
at the fans sometimes you see the same
fan<00:05:43.230> repeat<00:05:43.710> over<00:05:43.890> and<00:05:44.070> over<00:05:44.250> I<00:05:44.430> don't<00:05:44.760> know

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:49.470
