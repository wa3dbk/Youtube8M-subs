00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.800
This training video is all about ball handling and since you can't play basketball without handling the ball,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.400
the question is: how good are your handles?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.570
We're going to start off with some basic but effective one and 2-ball drills,

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.570
before we get to a variety of more elaborate 2-ball dribbling drills later in the video.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.900
We're going to demonstrate how good ball handling gets you wide open shots

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.000
out of a fast break situation. As a bonus, we're also going to show you

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.500
a few great juggling drills.
