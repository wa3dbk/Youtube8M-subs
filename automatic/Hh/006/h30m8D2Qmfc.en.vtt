00:00:00.929 --> 00:00:04.770
 hello while today the delicate possibilities on the five 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.360
 sense I make feet from opposite 

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.360
 and now we give six thefts of death 

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:14.069
 so for the song to read emc list proposes 

00:00:15.329 --> 00:00:18.720
 a rhythmic 1 that used trash beats 

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:22.259
 at the opera this pole 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.019
 47th 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.329
 to know that if robin 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:31.899
 on the record on the guitar I spoke to you then agree but not 

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.110
 me 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.270
 here we are going to have a limited effect on a pattern of our time 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.400
 when we can play the way that enough 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
 on minors 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.420
 so that makes 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.280
 free 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.430
 I blog her 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:02.450
 the blog 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.950
 What time 

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:07.950
 reforms upon arrival at the scene 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.060
 ve 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.109
 afp 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.430
 worst 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.310
 this is the last game on Friday parliament 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.130
 who can understand the meaning that rhythmic abatement that is very 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.130
 light that did with the power to make the connection 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.679
 on AIDS that takes place in a month benzema has even rhythmic afp 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.390
 so always come to reims 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:43.300
 but I block 

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.860
 the current block 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.110
 she 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:50.240
 cleric who can arrive 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.240
 ok the channel 22 october 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:04.150
 because she 

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:19.640
 OK then 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.389
 for others m 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:24.839
 so for a blow of the spell of m 

00:02:24.839 --> 00:02:28.019
 same type of rigor 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.430
 with the take out the single currency but this time they will see again at the 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.859
 play more natural marc rostan back and forth that is to say with us 

00:02:38.249 --> 00:02:42.419
 and then we're going to leave a little light, it's a possibility 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.109
 nintendo 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.989
 vandrisse cicta 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.889
 so for the second album track 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.459
 gold the earth 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.169
 an opera it's called 

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:31.549
 three seasons but it's not for them 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.049
 but otherwise the bnp 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.589
 was 

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:39.089
 initially with an alarming rate of setting up a baptism every 80 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.299
 the 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.479
 here is a kind of dry land 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:07.529
 and that's where we can play alone eric nicolas ie on the first 

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:08.399
 agreement 

00:04:08.399 --> 00:04:10.239
 they are two-step modules 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:12.109
 so 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:14.659
 the true departure to the bottom m 

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:18.009
 she has a good number of elected 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:19.329
 in the past 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.349
 I apply that to the agreement cap then 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.779
 to the act 

00:04:28.779 --> 00:04:31.779
 second time 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:35.080
 the day 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.780
 the hazards of creation not with this limit by department 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.330
 then the intermediary fadlallah to the farm of the first report 

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:46.460
 from each client 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.340
 on the terrace the back 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.599
 minors 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:52.460
 we will be able to add evening abatement 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.460
 be two steps away like these 

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:04.039
 for the street man shuhada quran 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:11.430
 world to compose 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:19.209
 she lost some empathic benchmarks and germany quickly put 

00:05:19.209 --> 00:05:22.209
 the head 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:26.509
 again and again
