00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
eyelashes after a couple of coats our

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.350 
eyelashes after a couple of coats our
next<00:02:35.610> step<00:02:36.180> would<00:02:37.050> be<00:02:37.110> to<00:02:37.770> clean<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:38.940> lashes

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
next step would be to clean the lashes

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.290 
next step would be to clean the lashes
with<00:02:39.750> a<00:02:39.780> spoolie<00:02:40.350> or<00:02:41.130> any<00:02:41.340> kind<00:02:41.640> of<00:02:41.880> eyelash

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
with a spoolie or any kind of eyelash

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.900 
with a spoolie or any kind of eyelash
brush<00:02:42.630> so<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.260> run<00:02:44.130> them<00:02:44.310> through<00:02:44.340> again

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
brush so I run them through again

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.449 
brush so I run them through again

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.260 

going<00:03:23.800> back<00:03:23.950> again<00:03:24.100> with<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.490> mascara<00:03:24.850> wand

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 
going back again with the mascara wand

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.550 
going back again with the mascara wand
to<00:03:25.750> add<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:26.260> little<00:03:26.320> bit<00:03:26.800> more<00:03:28.020> it's<00:03:29.020> up<00:03:29.200> to<00:03:29.410> you

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
to add a little bit more it's up to you

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.290 
to add a little bit more it's up to you
really<00:03:29.800> how<00:03:30.250> many<00:03:30.430> times<00:03:30.700> you<00:03:30.910> want<00:03:31.030> to<00:03:31.120> do

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:31.300 
really how many times you want to do

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:35.100 
really how many times you want to do
this<00:03:31.540> to<00:03:32.500> create<00:03:32.740> longer<00:03:33.580> thicker<00:03:34.150> fuller

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
this to create longer thicker fuller

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:44.750 
this to create longer thicker fuller
lashes<00:03:35.470> it's<00:03:36.190> up<00:03:36.340> to<00:03:36.550> you

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.830 

I<00:03:45.950> then<00:03:46.950> run<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.459> tip<00:03:47.760> of<00:03:47.790> the<00:03:48.120> wand<00:03:48.330> again

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
I then run the tip of the wand again

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.660 
I then run the tip of the wand again
through<00:03:49.349> my<00:03:49.500> eyelashes<00:03:50.159> because<00:03:50.310> when<00:03:50.549> you

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
through my eyelashes because when you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.580 
through my eyelashes because when you
get<00:03:50.819> a<00:03:50.849> bit<00:03:51.030> of<00:03:51.060> mascara<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.840> the<00:03:52.049> end<00:03:52.230> of<00:03:52.409> the

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
get a bit of mascara on the end of the

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.670 
get a bit of mascara on the end of the
wand<00:03:52.860> and<00:03:53.450> it<00:03:54.450> helps<00:03:54.780> to<00:03:54.900> create<00:03:55.019> a<00:03:55.319> more

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
wand and it helps to create a more

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:09.660 
wand and it helps to create a more
thicker<00:03:56.310> lash

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.850 

so<00:04:10.180> you<00:04:10.300> can<00:04:10.450> see<00:04:10.599> that<00:04:10.810> eyelashes<00:04:11.560> are

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
so you can see that eyelashes are

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.809 
so you can see that eyelashes are
becoming<00:04:12.340> thicker<00:04:12.930> and<00:04:14.099> yet<00:04:15.099> do<00:04:15.459> that<00:04:15.610> as<00:04:15.700> many

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
becoming thicker and yet do that as many

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:26.170 
becoming thicker and yet do that as many
times<00:04:15.970> as<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.359> want<00:04:16.540> really

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.950 

Oh

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.690 

okay<00:04:32.960> now<00:04:33.170> I'm<00:04:33.260> gonna<00:04:33.410> do<00:04:33.770> my<00:04:34.040> bottom<00:04:34.250> lashes

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
okay now I'm gonna do my bottom lashes

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.870 
okay now I'm gonna do my bottom lashes
so<00:04:35.120> I<00:04:35.150> use<00:04:35.540> the<00:04:35.780> tip<00:04:36.050> of<00:04:36.230> the<00:04:36.440> wand<00:04:36.710> to<00:04:37.490> run<00:04:37.730> them

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
so I use the tip of the wand to run them

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.480 
so I use the tip of the wand to run them
across<00:04:37.970> my<00:04:38.360> bottom<00:04:38.810> lashes<00:04:39.110> so<00:04:39.920> that<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.100> coat

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
across my bottom lashes so that I coat

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.070 
across my bottom lashes so that I coat
the<00:04:40.520> lashes<00:04:41.000> with<00:04:41.180> quite<00:04:41.390> a<00:04:41.420> bit<00:04:41.600> of<00:04:41.690> mascara

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080 
the lashes with quite a bit of mascara

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.110 
the lashes with quite a bit of mascara
and<00:04:42.470> then<00:04:42.860> I<00:04:42.950> use<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.250> same<00:04:43.460> technique<00:04:43.910> as<00:04:44.000> I

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
and then I use the same technique as I

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.240 
and then I use the same technique as I
did<00:04:44.270> on<00:04:44.330> my<00:04:44.390> top<00:04:44.720> lash<00:04:44.990> I<00:04:45.320> just<00:04:45.800> wiggle<00:04:46.160> the

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
did on my top lash I just wiggle the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.450 
did on my top lash I just wiggle the
brush<00:04:46.630> backwards<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.810> forwards<00:04:48.320> to<00:04:49.040> bring

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
brush backwards and forwards to bring

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:58.960 
brush backwards and forwards to bring
the<00:04:49.850> lashes<00:04:50.360> out<00:04:50.540> and<00:04:51.280> to<00:04:52.300> create<00:04:53.300> length<00:04:57.970> it

00:04:58.960 --> 00:04:58.970 
the lashes out and to create length it

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.730 
the lashes out and to create length it
almost<00:04:59.270> looks<00:04:59.600> as<00:04:59.720> if<00:04:59.780> my<00:05:00.020> bottom<00:05:00.350> lash<00:05:00.560> is

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
almost looks as if my bottom lash is

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.950 
almost looks as if my bottom lash is
actually<00:05:01.190> longer<00:05:01.400> than<00:05:01.640> my<00:05:02.360> top<00:05:02.630> lashes

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960
