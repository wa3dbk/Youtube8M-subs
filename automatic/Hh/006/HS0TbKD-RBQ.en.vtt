00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:12.910
 today I want with this video to reinforce math class 1 to my students 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:14.579
 of integral education 

00:00:14.579 --> 00:00:18.060
 of the National Experimental University of the Armed Forces 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 known as the uned 

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:25.060
 we start today the amount of the numbers 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.609
 we all know 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.579
 that jusán of the fingers began 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:30.759
 then 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.120
 They represent it by means of ekin ciccione or samples on piece of wood 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.840
 type of line drawn on the ground 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.390
 look 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.730
 there are infinite those milestones are symbols that we use to write 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:46.980
 the numbers 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.920
 latin art's pierina gigi tus what means shots 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.200
 walker the cost that the largest number 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.900
 Archimedes said 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.270
 the numerical system lacks upper limits 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.829
 no matter how large a number there will always be another greater than him 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.100
 in Asia the Nikkei index 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.910
 every number has two min values 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.820
 a value in itself 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.760
 which is always the same value 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.180
 where each number is placed 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.180
 and the position value 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.810
 it is the value 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.430
 which has each figure 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.700
 according to the place it occupies in the amount 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.730
 we will look for the following table 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.600
 Hundreds of tens of securities 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.890
 this represents the number 111 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.760
 the value by itself 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.250
 and the possession value is given by 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.770
 100 units 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.920
 diego units 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.040
 vivona unit 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.030
 pay attention 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.020
 a hundred representation units 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.020
 one ten represents 10 units 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.240
 and a unit represents clear hello is united 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.069
 Numbering systems 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.059
 let's see its definition 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:14.149
 is a set of symbols used to represent numbers 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:15.619
 at present 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.899
 we work with ten basic titles 

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:23.159
 which represent the zero 1 toos 

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:26.529
 4 5 months of January 

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.289
 7 8 

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:30.009
 and 9 

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:32.599
 and from there it is possible to build 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.759
 our numbering base 

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:37.189
 the qualy díez 

00:02:37.189 --> 00:02:38.479
 to the 

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:41.479
 a number with him to others build with the numerals 

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:45.179
 client the positional system 

00:02:45.179 --> 00:02:46.699
 each of the 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:50.750
 of the porten is with places they occupy and the symbols 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.109
 in the numeral 

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:55.109
 represent power must follow 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.150
 lithos that the numbering system uses as we now know 

00:03:03.149 --> 00:03:06.019
 we use the bacteria 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.170
 a clear example of this we have 1555 

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:13.789
 the last value that we find the last number 

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:16.309
 although the value of possession 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:17.549
 5 minutes 

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.669
 represents the pronaa 

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.609
 the second value 

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:24.649
 although the value of possession 

00:03:24.649 --> 00:03:25.860
 the minute 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.489
 runs presents the meadow 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.489
 of 5 by 10 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.739
 shortly rosemary 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.879
 comes a positions value 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:36.850
 the director sir 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:39.850
 better represents the product of 5% 

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.499
 bernake called c 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.829
 the operation and thinking about base 2 

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.609
 Experian 0 and 1% 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 we have used by the computer 

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:59.879
 higuita employ staff 

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.849
 which correspond 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.849
 this adolescence 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:06.089
 I'm with them indicated 

00:04:06.089 --> 00:04:07.619
 Cairo 

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:10.619
 was represented by the ing 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.620
 and the null as injured 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.620
 the supreme being 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:18.689
 the value of possession numeral 

00:04:18.689 --> 00:04:23.449
 if you do well here in this box are each of the values ​​represented 

00:04:23.449 --> 00:04:26.529
 that represent that possession value 

00:04:26.529 --> 00:04:29.529
 as we already know the unit represents lugo no 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.349
 the ten 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.529
 the eu arrives 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.919
 the centennial hall 2 

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:37.150
 my loyal day the 3 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.540
 knowing that you are potentially indicating the number of 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.889
 zeros that will correspond there is your daughter 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:48.360
 and so on until completing 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.360
 each of the values ​​of possession 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.340
 now that there is an activity that is performing 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.319
 remember 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:02.300
 that the possession value goal position value of a Swiss s1 maradona 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.970
 is determined by the place that the writer has said number 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.309
 performs the first activity 

00:05:09.309 --> 00:05:12.309
 will have albion example for resol network 

00:05:13.719 --> 00:05:15.249
 in the second ti 

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:17.129
 a must observe 

00:05:17.129 --> 00:05:19.939
 What place does the number four occupy? 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:24.059
 and you must complete the exercise you also have an example to be able to 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:26.650
 at number 3 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.020
 indicates the value of possession of caguas of the figure involved in the 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.499
 following numbers 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:37.409
 let's see now cipe magna opposition to what what called Roman numeration 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:42.300
 this representation or doctors theme employed by the Romans 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:46.439
 and do not use the 1st the prince to the relative value 

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.349
 was the value of the symbols always gelmini 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:52.490
 end includes place that occupies 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.219
 you just like them 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:56.590
 to write 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:05:58.029
 to throw 

00:05:58.029 --> 00:06:00.460
 numeral chapter of a work 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:03.389
 and in something I reread it 

00:06:03.389 --> 00:06:06.759
 this list is inscribed 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:09.759
 norms to represent Roman numerals 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:15.350
 placing the right one a figure could equal the value of the first 

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:18.350
 will be increased by the second 

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:21.330
 my agent can not 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:24.189
 pele that represents me 50 

00:06:24.189 --> 00:06:25.310

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.189
 kim equals 5 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.270
 50 + 5 is 55 m 

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:31.919
 second 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.259
 placed to the left of one figure another minor 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.050
 shuválov maple subtracts from previous 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.580
 think that there we have the bonus 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:43.080
 and you see what represents me 5 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.080
 5 - google 4 

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:51.770
 and third, in no case can more than 3'5 be used to equal it followed by the 

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:52.710
 right 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:54.379
 I see another higher figure 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:07:01.099
 mine and sides mima of bonus to the left of obama called the 40 not feel identity 

00:07:01.099 --> 00:07:02.759

 magnetic ninth mario román to the next appointment 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.710
 with this we will be what are the navigation systems 

00:07:33.279 --> 00:07:36.449
 for this I want to stop this little mental 

00:07:36.449 --> 00:07:41.490
 the 2 to reach the summit passes quickly and the enduring is the 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:43.539
 effort to conquer it 

00:07:43.539 --> 00:07:47.369
 my dear students, I hope you can use this message
