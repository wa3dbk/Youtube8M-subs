00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.750
 options and soul of the party option 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.760
 blues that is on the guitar and 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.730
 I do not have another car and queen or anyone who 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:23.730
 understand me but I'm still 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.730
 the soul of the holidays is to say 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.900
 partnerships 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.129

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:44.680
 I remember like tell me if it is as it has 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:48.140
 I arrived at 5 o'clock if I went through the 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:51.400
 actively the sat and ruth if to which he 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.400
 like option 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.740
 so it's hard not hard enough 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.170
 remember that you have two wild cards left 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.329
 with pain 

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.560
 what pain what pain to spend right now 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:09.229
 but good if I'm going to be 50 and 50 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.960
 and 40 and 50 is preferable to be mother you have 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.270
 doubt the song says I have no throne nor 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.759

 ice cream the king or the soul of the party 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:27.700

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.700

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.689
 with cher is difficult but has another 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.009
 wildcard 

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:38.009

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.850

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.420
 with antecedents follow repentance 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:50.250
