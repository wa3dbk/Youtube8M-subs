here the one screw that attacks to the
the<00:01:21.289> casing<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.160> we're<00:01:22.310> going<00:01:22.399> to<00:01:22.460> go<00:01:22.610> ahead

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
the casing so we're going to go ahead

screwdriver let me go ahead and remove
that<00:01:28.610> and<00:01:29.619> we<00:01:30.619> just<00:01:30.650> set<00:01:31.009> it<00:01:31.130> off<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.520> side

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
that and we just set it off to the side

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:40.840 
that and we just set it off to the side
there's<00:01:32.030> not<00:01:32.180> very<00:01:32.210> many<00:01:32.600> screws

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:46.860 

you

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.750 

all<00:01:47.530> right<00:01:47.770> so<00:01:47.950> now<00:01:48.130> we're<00:01:48.340> down<00:01:48.460> to<00:01:48.670> the

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
all right so now we're down to the

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.010 
all right so now we're down to the
motherboard<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.270> reason<00:01:49.570> we<00:01:49.660> have<00:01:49.750> to<00:01:49.870> move

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
motherboard the reason we have to move

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.840 
motherboard the reason we have to move
pull<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.470> motherboard<00:01:50.980> out<00:01:51.100> is<00:01:51.310> because<00:01:51.700> we

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
pull the motherboard out is because we

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.840 
pull the motherboard out is because we
cannot<00:01:52.360> get<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.110> brackets<00:01:53.800> that<00:01:54.070> hold

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
cannot get to the brackets that hold

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.210 
cannot get to the brackets that hold
this<00:01:55.270> back<00:01:55.540> plate<00:01:55.840> in<00:01:56.200> place<00:01:56.560> but<00:01:56.890> this<00:01:57.040> is

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
this back plate in place but this is

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.280 
this back plate in place but this is
very<00:01:57.430> easy<00:01:57.790> they've<00:01:58.420> actually<00:01:58.660> made<00:01:59.110> this

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.290 
very easy they've actually made this

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.200 
very easy they've actually made this
fairly<00:01:59.620> easy<00:01:59.920> there's<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.280> lever<00:02:00.580> here<00:02:00.730> and

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
fairly easy there's a lever here and

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.510 
fairly easy there's a lever here and
basically<00:02:02.080> all<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.680> do<00:02:02.830> is<00:02:02.950> you<00:02:03.070> pull<00:02:03.340> it<00:02:03.430> up

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
basically all you do is you pull it up

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.870 
basically all you do is you pull it up
and<00:02:03.700> you<00:02:04.050> pull<00:02:05.050> the<00:02:05.470> unit<00:02:05.830> back<00:02:06.040> like<00:02:06.640> that

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
and you pull the unit back like that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.870 
and you pull the unit back like that
they<00:02:07.390> pull<00:02:07.750> up<00:02:07.930> and<00:02:08.170> pull<00:02:08.740> back<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.250> then<00:02:09.729> the

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
they pull up and pull back and then the

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.290 
they pull up and pull back and then the
motherboard<00:02:10.710> can<00:02:11.710> come<00:02:11.980> loose<00:02:12.220> and<00:02:12.520> that's<00:02:13.090> as

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
motherboard can come loose and that's as

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.060 
motherboard can come loose and that's as
easy<00:02:13.450> as<00:02:13.630> that<00:02:13.720> can<00:02:14.140> get<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.710> we're<00:02:14.860> going<00:02:15.010> to

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
easy as that can get and we're going to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.510 
easy as that can get and we're going to
disconnect<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:16.600> the<00:02:16.750> audio<00:02:17.110> cable

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
disconnect the this is the audio cable

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.850 
disconnect the this is the audio cable
for<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.610> front<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.120> the<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.540> the<00:02:19.960> USB<00:02:20.680> for

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
for the front and the and the USB for

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.190 
for the front and the and the USB for
the<00:02:20.950> front<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.370> then<00:02:21.880> there<00:02:22.090> is<00:02:22.180> also<00:02:22.480> the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
the front and then there is also the

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.410 
the front and then there is also the
speaker<00:02:23.590> cable<00:02:24.160> for<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.460> front<00:02:24.820> we'll<00:02:25.090> remove

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
speaker cable for the front we'll remove

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.120 
speaker cable for the front we'll remove
that<00:02:25.690> and<00:02:25.990> oh<00:02:26.980> we<00:02:27.610> do<00:02:27.760> have<00:02:27.790> this<00:02:29.130> pin

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
that and oh we do have this pin

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:32.640 
that and oh we do have this pin
connector<00:02:30.700> for<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:30.970> front<00:02:31.330> that<00:02:32.140> turns<00:02:32.470> on

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
connector for the front that turns on

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.470 
connector for the front that turns on
the<00:02:32.680> power<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.430> the<00:02:33.880> lights<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:34.360> the<00:02:34.450> front

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
the power and the lights on the front

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.230 
the power and the lights on the front
basically<00:02:34.900> the<00:02:35.260> power<00:02:35.530> switch<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.130> then<00:02:36.760> we

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
basically the power switch and then we

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.810 
basically the power switch and then we
have<00:02:37.540> a<00:02:37.870> fan<00:02:38.470> connector<00:02:39.070> for<00:02:39.280> the<00:02:39.370> front<00:02:39.640> so

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
have a fan connector for the front so

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:41.130 
have a fan connector for the front so
we're<00:02:39.970> going<00:02:40.120> to<00:02:40.180> we're<00:02:40.630> going<00:02:40.750> to<00:02:40.810> disconnect

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
we're going to we're going to disconnect

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.990 
we're going to we're going to disconnect
all<00:02:41.410> that<00:02:41.620> and<00:02:41.800> then<00:02:42.100> we<00:02:42.280> can<00:02:42.460> move<00:02:42.730> the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
all that and then we can move the

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.570 
all that and then we can move the
motherboard<00:02:43.540> off<00:02:43.690> to<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.230> side<00:02:44.530> so<00:02:45.280> for<00:02:45.460> this

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
motherboard off to the side so for this

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.060 
motherboard off to the side so for this
video<00:02:45.880> purposes<00:02:46.210> I<00:02:46.420> did<00:02:46.930> remove<00:02:47.410> the<00:02:47.680> IDE

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
video purposes I did remove the IDE

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.630 
video purposes I did remove the IDE
cables<00:02:48.870> now<00:02:49.870> if<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.230> see<00:02:50.470> down<00:02:50.710> in<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.160> this

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640 
cables now if you see down in here this

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.699 
cables now if you see down in here this
is<00:02:51.700> the<00:02:51.910> main<00:02:52.270> part<00:02:52.570> of<00:02:52.720> contention<00:02:53.350> you

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
is the main part of contention you

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.580 
is the main part of contention you
really<00:02:54.070> can't<00:02:54.280> get<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.640> these<00:02:54.790> brackets

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
really can't get to these brackets

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.440 
really can't get to these brackets
unless<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.800> take<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.190> motherboard<00:02:57.700> out<00:02:57.790> so

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
unless you take the motherboard out so

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.620 
unless you take the motherboard out so
before<00:02:59.550> before<00:03:00.550> we<00:03:00.700> remove<00:03:01.150> this<00:03:01.360> bracket

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
before before we remove this bracket

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.320 
before before we remove this bracket
there's<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.560> couple<00:03:02.830> screws<00:03:03.340> this<00:03:03.910> one<00:03:04.120> right

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
there's a couple screws this one right

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.160 
there's a couple screws this one right
here<00:03:04.840> connects<00:03:05.500> to<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.800> chassis<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.489> then

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
here connects to the chassis and then

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.020 
here connects to the chassis and then
this<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.440> right<00:03:08.620> here<00:03:09.070> connects<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
this one right here connects to the

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.760 
this one right here connects to the
chassis<00:03:10.480> also<00:03:10.660> so<00:03:11.080> we're<00:03:11.200> going<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.380> go<00:03:11.560> and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
chassis also so we're going to go and

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.900 
chassis also so we're going to go and
remove<00:03:12.070> those<00:03:12.340> two<00:03:12.640> screws

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.270 

okay<00:03:18.600> so<00:03:18.660> now<00:03:18.930> we've<00:03:19.230> got<00:03:19.260> those<00:03:19.710> off<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
okay so now we've got those off it

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.610 
okay so now we've got those off it
should<00:03:20.790> be<00:03:20.970> pretty<00:03:21.210> easy<00:03:21.330> to<00:03:21.900> remove<00:03:22.200> this<00:03:22.440> but

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
should be pretty easy to remove this but

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.020 
should be pretty easy to remove this but
you<00:03:22.770> can<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.070> it's<00:03:23.190> kind<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.520> stuck<00:03:23.790> that's

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
you can see it's kind of stuck that's

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.620 
you can see it's kind of stuck that's
why<00:03:24.180> I've<00:03:24.300> made<00:03:24.330> it<00:03:24.630> almost<00:03:25.220> impossible<00:03:26.220> to<00:03:26.630> do

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
why I've made it almost impossible to do

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.840 
why I've made it almost impossible to do
this<00:03:27.840> without<00:03:28.170> removing<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.980> motherboard<00:03:29.520> so

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
this without removing the motherboard so

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.730 
this without removing the motherboard so
you<00:03:30.000> can<00:03:30.180> see<00:03:30.360> that<00:03:30.570> basically<00:03:31.050> that<00:03:31.590> where

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:31.740 
you can see that basically that where

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.310 
you can see that basically that where
the<00:03:31.920> brackets<00:03:32.460> come<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.240> place<00:03:33.480> just<00:03:33.780> kind<00:03:34.290> of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
the brackets come in place just kind of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.870 
the brackets come in place just kind of
kind<00:03:34.560> of<00:03:34.590> like<00:03:34.680> gently<00:03:35.100> pull<00:03:35.430> put<00:03:35.730> our

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
kind of like gently pull put our

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.750 
kind of like gently pull put our
screwdriver<00:03:36.870> underneath<00:03:37.200> there<00:03:37.530> kind<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.400> try

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
screwdriver underneath there kind of try

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.630 
screwdriver underneath there kind of try
it<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.090> then<00:03:39.330> it<00:03:39.510> should<00:03:39.810> just<00:03:40.440> come<00:03:40.830> right

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
it and then it should just come right

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.700 
it and then it should just come right
out<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.910> little<00:03:42.240> bit<00:03:42.420> for<00:03:42.660> this<00:03:43.020> is<00:03:43.260> what<00:03:43.470> holds

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:43.710 
out a little bit for this is what holds

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.500 
out a little bit for this is what holds
the<00:03:43.980> power<00:03:44.130> supply<00:03:44.580> from<00:03:44.760> coming<00:03:45.210> out<00:03:45.330> the

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
the power supply from coming out the

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.510 
the power supply from coming out the
back<00:03:45.740> I'm<00:03:46.740> going<00:03:46.800> to<00:03:46.920> put<00:03:46.980> that<00:03:47.190> off<00:03:47.340> to<00:03:47.460> the

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:47.520 
back I'm going to put that off to the

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.420 
back I'm going to put that off to the
side<00:03:47.610> here's<00:03:48.360> our<00:03:48.510> power<00:03:48.750> supply<00:03:49.230> I<00:03:49.470> make<00:03:50.280> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
side here's our power supply I make it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:50.960 
side here's our power supply I make it
look<00:03:50.580> easy

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
look easy

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:53.270 
look easy
but<00:03:51.420> it's<00:03:51.540> in<00:03:51.720> a<00:03:51.810> bracket<00:03:52.110> similar<00:03:52.800> to<00:03:53.040> these

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
but it's in a bracket similar to these

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.940 
but it's in a bracket similar to these
it's<00:03:53.670> on<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.270> bottom<00:03:54.480> of<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.870> motherboard<00:03:55.410> it

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
it's on the bottom of the motherboard it

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.910 
it's on the bottom of the motherboard it
has<00:03:56.130> these<00:03:56.370> brackets<00:03:56.820> like<00:03:57.450> this<00:03:57.510> that<00:03:58.440> holds

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
has these brackets like this that holds

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.210 
has these brackets like this that holds
that<00:03:59.070> power<00:03:59.370> supply<00:03:59.820> unit<00:04:00.240> into<00:04:00.870> place<00:04:01.130> so<00:04:02.130> if

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
that power supply unit into place so if

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.430 
that power supply unit into place so if
this<00:04:02.370> computer<00:04:02.640> is<00:04:02.970> fairly<00:04:03.330> old<00:04:03.690> and<00:04:04.020> has

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
this computer is fairly old and has

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.620 
this computer is fairly old and has
never<00:04:04.500> been<00:04:04.890> maintenance<00:04:05.370> before<00:04:05.820> it<00:04:06.330> might

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
never been maintenance before it might

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.270 
never been maintenance before it might
get<00:04:06.840> stuck<00:04:07.110> you<00:04:07.440> might<00:04:07.620> need<00:04:07.770> to<00:04:07.920> use<00:04:08.070> your

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
get stuck you might need to use your

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.460 
get stuck you might need to use your
screwdriver<00:04:08.490> to<00:04:08.910> kind<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.180> pry<00:04:09.240> it<00:04:09.480> here's

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
screwdriver to kind of pry it here's

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.550 
screwdriver to kind of pry it here's
basically<00:04:10.710> you<00:04:11.310> just<00:04:11.550> push<00:04:11.730> it<00:04:11.880> forward<00:04:12.270> and

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
basically you just push it forward and

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.560 
basically you just push it forward and
pull<00:04:13.560> it<00:04:13.680> up<00:04:13.830> and<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.820> can<00:04:15.060> see<00:04:15.210> on<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.420> bottom

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
pull it up and you can see on the bottom

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.210 
pull it up and you can see on the bottom
of<00:04:15.750> the<00:04:15.810> power<00:04:16.020> supply<00:04:16.440> that<00:04:16.709> it<00:04:17.100> was

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
of the power supply that it was

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.070 
of the power supply that it was
basically<00:04:17.670> hooked<00:04:17.970> in<00:04:18.180> from<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.540> bottom<00:04:18.750> and

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
basically hooked in from the bottom and

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.170 
basically hooked in from the bottom and
it<00:04:19.410> had<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.680> go<00:04:19.799> in<00:04:19.950> one<00:04:20.100> way<00:04:20.130> so<00:04:20.760> now<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:20.940> would

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
it had to go in one way so now you would

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.750 
it had to go in one way so now you would
add<00:04:21.299> your<00:04:21.330> new<00:04:21.630> power<00:04:21.930> supply<00:04:22.440> you<00:04:23.250> get<00:04:23.400> one<00:04:23.640> of

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
add your new power supply you get one of

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.030 
add your new power supply you get one of
those<00:04:23.910> on<00:04:24.180> any<00:04:24.330> suppliers<00:04:24.870> you<00:04:25.680> can<00:04:25.860> check

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
those on any suppliers you can check

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.580 
those on any suppliers you can check
around<00:04:26.190> your<00:04:26.640> local<00:04:27.240> listings<00:04:27.840> we<00:04:28.320> should<00:04:28.500> be

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
around your local listings we should be

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.520 
around your local listings we should be
able<00:04:28.680> to<00:04:28.770> find<00:04:28.980> one<00:04:29.220> pretty<00:04:29.550> easily

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
able to find one pretty easily

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:33.560 
able to find one pretty easily
I<00:04:31.560> found<00:04:32.070> the<00:04:32.250> hardest<00:04:32.490> part<00:04:32.970> of<00:04:33.180> this<00:04:33.360> is

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:33.570 
I found the hardest part of this is

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.930 
I found the hardest part of this is
basically<00:04:34.320> putting<00:04:34.680> it<00:04:34.920> back<00:04:35.070> into<00:04:35.340> place<00:04:35.670> and

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
basically putting it back into place and

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.380 
basically putting it back into place and
again<00:04:36.600> you<00:04:37.020> notice<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.620> the<00:04:38.100> bracket<00:04:39.030> holders

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
again you notice the the bracket holders

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.360 
again you notice the the bracket holders
that<00:04:39.600> go<00:04:39.780> into<00:04:40.050> the<00:04:40.350> motherboard<00:04:40.680> so<00:04:41.310> you

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
that go into the motherboard so you

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.810 
that go into the motherboard so you
can't<00:04:41.910> get<00:04:42.030> it<00:04:42.090> too<00:04:42.390> far<00:04:42.630> out<00:04:42.930> of<00:04:42.960> bounds<00:04:43.260> and

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
can't get it too far out of bounds and

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.550 
can't get it too far out of bounds and
one<00:04:44.820> thing<00:04:45.060> you<00:04:45.210> want<00:04:45.420> to<00:04:45.480> do<00:04:45.690> is<00:04:46.200> make<00:04:46.530> sure

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:46.560 
one thing you want to do is make sure

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.600 
one thing you want to do is make sure
that<00:04:46.800> this<00:04:47.220> these<00:04:47.910> cables<00:04:49.010> come<00:04:50.010> under<00:04:50.370> here

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:50.610 
that this these cables come under here

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.980 
that this these cables come under here
beneath<00:04:51.590> this<00:04:52.590> this<00:04:53.100> USB<00:04:53.820> sound<00:04:54.300> connector

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990 
beneath this this USB sound connector

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.770 
beneath this this USB sound connector
that<00:04:55.140> goes<00:04:55.200> to<00:04:55.530> the<00:04:55.620> motherboard<00:04:55.770> otherwise

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:56.780 
that goes to the motherboard otherwise

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:00.410 
that goes to the motherboard otherwise
whenever<00:04:57.780> you<00:04:57.990> try<00:04:58.230> to<00:04:58.260> shut<00:04:58.740> the<00:04:59.010> top<00:04:59.420> this

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:00.420 
whenever you try to shut the top this

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:02.600 
whenever you try to shut the top this
part<00:05:00.780> won't<00:05:00.930> hold<00:05:01.470> all<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:01.860> way<00:05:01.950> down<00:05:02.190> and<00:05:02.490> the

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:02.610 
part won't hold all the way down and the

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.610 
part won't hold all the way down and the
lid<00:05:02.930> properly<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.020> you'll<00:05:04.110> have<00:05:04.230> to<00:05:04.350> take<00:05:04.530> it

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
lid properly and you'll have to take it

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.560 
lid properly and you'll have to take it
apart<00:05:04.890> so<00:05:05.370> basically<00:05:05.760> you<00:05:05.940> get<00:05:06.090> it<00:05:06.240> in<00:05:06.330> there

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:06.570 
apart so basically you get it in there

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.930 
apart so basically you get it in there
right<00:05:06.930> about<00:05:07.230> here<00:05:07.710> there's<00:05:08.190> a<00:05:08.310> little<00:05:08.550> line

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:08.940 
right about here there's a little line

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.440 
right about here there's a little line
here<00:05:09.080> where<00:05:10.080> this<00:05:10.290> back<00:05:10.980> part<00:05:11.370> is<00:05:11.580> if<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.150> sit

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:12.450 
here where this back part is if you sit

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:14.030 
here where this back part is if you sit
it<00:05:12.630> right<00:05:12.870> in<00:05:13.050> there<00:05:13.230> it's<00:05:13.350> nice<00:05:13.530> and<00:05:13.830> flat

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
it right in there it's nice and flat

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.520 
it right in there it's nice and flat
what<00:05:14.700> I<00:05:14.730> did<00:05:15.060> the<00:05:15.240> first<00:05:15.420> couple<00:05:15.900> times<00:05:16.080> was<00:05:16.410> I

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:16.530 
what I did the first couple times was I

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:18.080 
what I did the first couple times was I
tried<00:05:16.800> to<00:05:16.920> sit<00:05:17.130> it<00:05:17.220> all<00:05:17.370> the<00:05:17.520> way<00:05:17.580> up<00:05:17.700> there<00:05:17.970> and

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
tried to sit it all the way up there and

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.180 
tried to sit it all the way up there and
it<00:05:18.150> just<00:05:18.360> wouldn't<00:05:18.540> go<00:05:18.660> in<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.140> I<00:05:19.650> just<00:05:19.890> sit<00:05:20.070> it

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
it just wouldn't go in so I just sit it

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:21.560 
it just wouldn't go in so I just sit it
right<00:05:20.220> there<00:05:20.550> and<00:05:20.640> it's<00:05:20.760> nice<00:05:20.880> and<00:05:21.150> flat<00:05:21.300> and

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:21.570 
right there and it's nice and flat and

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:22.980 
right there and it's nice and flat and
push<00:05:22.380> it<00:05:22.560> in

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
push it in

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.920 
push it in
it<00:05:23.320> almost<00:05:23.949> goes<00:05:24.310> flush<00:05:24.789> with<00:05:25.300> that<00:05:25.449> backside

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
it almost goes flush with that backside

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.600 
it almost goes flush with that backside
so<00:05:26.440> that's<00:05:26.620> basically<00:05:27.130> it

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:27.610 
so that's basically it

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.980 
so that's basically it
and<00:05:27.699> now<00:05:28.360> I'm<00:05:28.449> going<00:05:28.600> to<00:05:28.660> put<00:05:28.780> it<00:05:28.870> back

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
and now I'm going to put it back

00:05:28.990 --> 00:06:32.100 
and now I'm going to put it back
together<00:05:29.169> and<00:05:29.650> fast<00:05:30.340> speed<00:06:30.690> alright<00:06:31.690> so<00:06:31.930> this

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:32.110 
together and fast speed alright so this

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:34.290 
together and fast speed alright so this
is<00:06:32.320> very<00:06:32.500> important<00:06:33.039> in<00:06:33.159> one<00:06:33.849> of<00:06:33.940> the<00:06:34.000> most<00:06:34.120> a

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:47.040 
underneath this fan area and this USB
area<00:06:44.740> they<00:06:45.520> really<00:06:45.909> shouldn't<00:06:46.240> harm<00:06:46.479> anything

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
area they really shouldn't harm anything

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.350 
area they really shouldn't harm anything
if<00:06:47.199> you<00:06:47.260> don't<00:06:47.470> use<00:06:47.800> zip<00:06:48.550> ties<00:06:48.789> but<00:06:49.060> you<00:06:49.210> can

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:49.360 
if you don't use zip ties but you can

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:57.210 
if you don't use zip ties but you can
see<00:06:49.539> I'm<00:06:50.110> not<00:06:50.440> getting<00:06:50.800> it<00:06:50.919> flush<00:06:56.009> all<00:06:57.009> right

00:06:57.210 --> 00:06:57.220 
see I'm not getting it flush all right

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:58.589
