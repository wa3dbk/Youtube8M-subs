cities motion one and two but it was
completely<00:01:04.770> focused<00:01:05.770> on<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.270> mass<00:01:07.270> transit

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
completely focused on the mass transit

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.749 
completely focused on the mass transit
and<00:01:07.899> this<00:01:08.770> time<00:01:09.009> it's<00:01:09.190> gonna<00:01:09.369> be<00:01:09.460> like

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759

00:01:49.949 --> 00:01:49.959 
exactly and I mean it was surprised when

00:01:49.959 --> 00:01:51.979 
exactly and I mean it was surprised when
they<00:01:50.200> when<00:01:50.530> they<00:01:50.709> announced<00:01:50.979> it<00:01:51.130> but

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:51.989 
they when they announced it but

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.529 
they when they announced it but
basically<00:01:52.989> where<00:01:53.800> we<00:01:54.550> have<00:01:54.880> been<00:01:55.179> wanting<00:01:55.360> to

00:01:55.529 --> 00:01:55.539 
basically where we have been wanting to

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:57.809 
basically where we have been wanting to
do<00:01:55.750> this<00:01:55.780> for<00:01:56.080> so<00:01:56.259> long<00:01:56.289> and<00:01:56.470> we<00:01:56.770> have<00:01:56.979> a<00:01:57.250> clear

00:01:57.809 --> 00:01:57.819 
do this for so long and we have a clear

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.699 
do this for so long and we have a clear
idea<00:01:57.849> in<00:01:58.300> our<00:01:58.390> head<00:01:58.599> what<00:01:58.750> this<00:01:58.929> game<00:01:59.140> is<00:01:59.349> this

00:01:59.699 --> 00:01:59.709 
idea in our head what this game is this

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.370 
idea in our head what this game is this
is<00:01:59.890> the<00:02:00.130> kind<00:02:00.489> of<00:02:00.550> freeform<00:02:00.959> city<00:02:01.959> builder

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
is the kind of freeform city builder

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.770 
is the kind of freeform city builder
where<00:02:02.619> people<00:02:03.009> get<00:02:03.160> to<00:02:03.340> really<00:02:03.729> join<00:02:04.000> in<00:02:04.209> to

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
where people get to really join in to

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:07.919 
where people get to really join in to
the<00:02:05.020> development<00:02:05.649> through<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.759> user<00:02:07.300> created

00:02:07.919 --> 00:02:07.929 
the development through the user created

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.570 
the development through the user created
content<00:02:08.110> which<00:02:08.560> I<00:02:08.679> think<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:08.950> plays<00:02:09.369> a<00:02:09.489> huge

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
content which I think it plays a huge

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.720 
content which I think it plays a huge
part<00:02:09.910> at<00:02:10.450> least<00:02:10.569> in<00:02:10.810> our<00:02:11.319> previous<00:02:11.860> games<00:02:12.160> so

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
part at least in our previous games so

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.369 
part at least in our previous games so
we're<00:02:13.150> really<00:02:13.420> putting<00:02:13.629> emphasis<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.290> the

00:02:14.369 --> 00:02:14.379 
we're really putting emphasis on the

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:16.440 
we're really putting emphasis on the
modding<00:02:14.650> tools<00:02:14.920> people<00:02:15.610> get<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.000> create<00:02:16.270> their

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
modding tools people get to create their

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.930 
modding tools people get to create their
own<00:02:16.599> assets<00:02:17.110> they<00:02:17.440> get<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:18.040> actually<00:02:18.430> make

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
own assets they get to actually make

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.540 
own assets they get to actually make
really<00:02:19.360> cool<00:02:20.110> advanced<00:02:20.709> mods<00:02:20.950> with<00:02:21.220> our<00:02:21.340> new

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
really cool advanced mods with our new

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.040 
really cool advanced mods with our new
API<00:02:22.420> for<00:02:22.540> that<00:02:22.720> and<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:24.280> to<00:02:24.459> this<00:02:25.300> game<00:02:25.569> it's

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
API for that and just to this game it's

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.949 
API for that and just to this game it's
like<00:02:26.200> bigger<00:02:26.940> more<00:02:27.940> control<00:02:28.390> to<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.690> player

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
like bigger more control to the player

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.610 
like bigger more control to the player
all<00:02:29.830> across<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.400> board<00:02:31.200> that's<00:02:32.200> that's

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:32.620 
all across the board that's that's

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.229 
all across the board that's that's
really<00:02:32.770> one<00:02:32.950> thing<00:02:33.160> that<00:02:33.580> struck<00:02:33.849> me<00:02:33.910> that's

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
really one thing that struck me that's

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.390 
really one thing that struck me that's
the<00:02:34.510> scale<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:35.020> things<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.739> is<00:02:35.800> really<00:02:36.250> like

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
the scale of things this is really like

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.780 
the scale of things this is really like
a<00:02:36.430> proper<00:02:37.209> city<00:02:37.540> sized<00:02:38.200> thing<00:02:38.739> where<00:02:38.980> you<00:02:39.159> you

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
a proper city sized thing where you you

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:41.970 
a proper city sized thing where you you
know<00:02:39.909> it's<00:02:40.629> not<00:02:40.750> it's<00:02:41.079> not<00:02:41.290> enough<00:02:41.590> just<00:02:41.620> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
know it's not it's not enough just a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.330 
know it's not it's not enough just a
little<00:02:42.219> neighborhood<00:02:42.400> that<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:42.909> bill

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
little neighborhood that you bill

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.130 
little neighborhood that you bill
you're<00:02:43.489> building<00:02:43.730> out<00:02:43.849> a<00:02:43.880> huge<00:02:44.540> city<00:02:44.780> and

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
you're building out a huge city and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.800 
you're building out a huge city and
potentially<00:02:45.709> very<00:02:46.130> huge<00:02:46.730> big<00:02:47.030> one<00:02:47.209> yeah

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
potentially very huge big one yeah

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.570 
potentially very huge big one yeah
exactly<00:02:48.050> and<00:02:48.349> there's<00:02:48.680> the<00:02:48.980> kind<00:02:49.160> of<00:02:49.250> option

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:49.580 
exactly and there's the kind of option

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.309 
exactly and there's the kind of option
for<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.849> because<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.120> start<00:02:50.390> with<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.900> two

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:51.319 
for you because you start with the two

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.440 
for you because you start with the two
kilometers<00:02:51.739> by<00:02:51.920> two<00:02:52.250> kilometers<00:02:52.730> map<00:02:53.209> tile

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
kilometers by two kilometers map tile

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.050 
kilometers by two kilometers map tile
and<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:54.560> can<00:02:54.739> basically<00:02:54.920> expand<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.790> see<00:02:55.940> the

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and you can basically expand to see the

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.690 
and you can basically expand to see the
older<00:02:57.010> way<00:02:58.010> to<00:02:58.069> 9<00:02:58.610> map<00:02:59.090> tiles<00:02:59.360> and<00:02:59.750> it<00:03:00.470> is

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
older way to 9 map tiles and it is

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.100 
older way to 9 map tiles and it is
something<00:03:01.700> that<00:03:01.849> you<00:03:01.940> get<00:03:02.450> to<00:03:02.599> choose<00:03:02.870> that

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
something that you get to choose that

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.400 
something that you get to choose that
will<00:03:03.530> you<00:03:03.739> have<00:03:03.980> actually<00:03:04.370> like<00:03:04.489> smaller

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
will you have actually like smaller

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.830 
will you have actually like smaller
cities<00:03:06.430> in<00:03:07.430> that<00:03:07.670> area<00:03:08.120> or<00:03:08.330> will<00:03:08.569> you<00:03:08.660> actually

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
cities in that area or will you actually

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.020 
cities in that area or will you actually
start<00:03:09.200> building<00:03:09.530> one<00:03:09.560> absolutely<00:03:10.430> huge<00:03:10.790> one

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
start building one absolutely huge one

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.150 
start building one absolutely huge one
with<00:03:11.209> up<00:03:11.390> to<00:03:11.569> million<00:03:12.019> people<00:03:12.380> living<00:03:12.560> in<00:03:12.739> it

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
with up to million people living in it

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.210 
with up to million people living in it
so<00:03:14.030> you<00:03:14.269> mentioned<00:03:14.660> how<00:03:14.989> user<00:03:15.260> create<00:03:15.799> created

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
so you mentioned how user create created

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.490 
so you mentioned how user create created
content<00:03:16.730> and<00:03:16.940> that<00:03:17.030> sort<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:17.870> seems<00:03:18.080> like<00:03:18.260> one

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
content and that sort of seems like one

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.320 
content and that sort of seems like one
take<00:03:18.769> away<00:03:18.799> that<00:03:19.190> from<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.549> earlier<00:03:19.819> games<00:03:20.090> do

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
take away that from the earlier games do

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.759 
take away that from the earlier games do
you<00:03:20.360> have<00:03:20.510> any<00:03:20.660> other<00:03:20.870> takeaways<00:03:21.530> from

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
you have any other takeaways from

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.590 
you have any other takeaways from
citizen<00:03:22.190> motions<00:03:22.519> hidden<00:03:22.850> motion<00:03:23.209> to<00:03:23.390> that

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:23.600 
citizen motions hidden motion to that

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600 
citizen motions hidden motion to that
that<00:03:24.110> you<00:03:24.140> sort<00:03:24.500> of<00:03:24.530> that<00:03:24.799> has<00:03:24.920> shaped<00:03:25.250> the<00:03:25.489> way

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
that you sort of that has shaped the way

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.460 
that you sort of that has shaped the way
that<00:03:25.850> this<00:03:25.940> game<00:03:26.060> is<00:03:26.390> developed

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
that this game is developed

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.440 
that this game is developed
well<00:03:28.010> basically<00:03:28.220> which<00:03:28.580> cities<00:03:28.849> motion<00:03:29.180> to<00:03:29.299> we

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
well basically which cities motion to we

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.539 
well basically which cities motion to we
started<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.840> experiment<00:03:30.530> on<00:03:30.620> basically<00:03:31.430> a

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
started to experiment on basically a

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:34.270 
started to experiment on basically a
huge<00:03:31.790> map<00:03:32.030> size<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.569> we<00:03:32.980> noticed<00:03:33.980> that<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.160> is

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
huge map size and we noticed that it is

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.979 
huge map size and we noticed that it is
completely<00:03:34.640> possible<00:03:34.880> and<00:03:35.390> we<00:03:35.690> really

00:03:35.979 --> 00:03:35.989 
completely possible and we really

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:38.289 
completely possible and we really
brought<00:03:36.230> that<00:03:36.500> to<00:03:37.220> this<00:03:37.370> game<00:03:37.640> as<00:03:37.790> well<00:03:37.940> to<00:03:38.180> see

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
brought that to this game as well to see

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:39.970 
brought that to this game as well to see
the<00:03:38.390> skylines<00:03:38.840> because<00:03:39.110> I<00:03:39.260> think<00:03:39.709> it's<00:03:39.830> very

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
the skylines because I think it's very

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:41.850 
the skylines because I think it's very
important<00:03:40.549> for<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.760> players<00:03:40.940> to<00:03:41.060> be<00:03:41.239> able<00:03:41.269> to

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:41.860 
important for the players to be able to

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:44.440 
important for the players to be able to
kind<00:03:42.860> of<00:03:42.950> create<00:03:43.220> the<00:03:43.580> city<00:03:43.760> of<00:03:43.910> their<00:03:44.090> dreams

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
kind of create the city of their dreams

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.870 
kind of create the city of their dreams
as<00:03:44.660> well<00:03:44.840> and<00:03:45.080> and<00:03:45.260> that<00:03:45.920> might<00:03:46.400> take<00:03:46.700> a<00:03:46.760> little

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
as well and and that might take a little

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.630 
as well and and that might take a little
bit<00:03:47.540> more<00:03:47.630> space<00:03:48.380> than<00:03:48.590> just<00:03:48.920> the<00:03:49.100> first<00:03:49.370> map

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:49.640 
bit more space than just the first map

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.009 
bit more space than just the first map
tiles<00:03:49.910> so<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.720> is<00:03:50.900> so<00:03:51.109> that<00:03:51.459> also<00:03:52.840> that<00:03:53.840> was

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
tiles so it is so that also that was

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.710 
tiles so it is so that also that was
like<00:03:54.470> a<00:03:54.500> major<00:03:54.709> major<00:03:55.100> take<00:03:56.000> away<00:03:56.209> from<00:03:56.480> from

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
like a major major take away from from

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.660 
like a major major take away from from
cities<00:03:57.019> motion<00:03:57.320> to<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.829> course<00:03:58.100> the<00:03:58.250> transport

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
cities motion to of course the transport

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.380 
cities motion to of course the transport
is<00:03:59.120> very<00:03:59.480> close<00:04:00.200> or<00:04:00.380> hearts<00:04:00.769> so<00:04:01.370> we<00:04:01.730> still<00:04:02.120> have

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
is very close or hearts so we still have

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.930 
is very close or hearts so we still have
public<00:04:03.260> transportation<00:04:03.290> option<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:04.760> game

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:04.940 
public transportation option in the game

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.140 
public transportation option in the game
and<00:04:05.180> we<00:04:05.329> have<00:04:05.510> also<00:04:05.690> added<00:04:06.760> airplanes<00:04:07.760> and

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
and we have also added airplanes and

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.870 
and we have also added airplanes and
there<00:04:08.989> will<00:04:09.109> be<00:04:09.140> ships<00:04:09.470> with<00:04:09.799> harbors<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:10.489> it

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
there will be ships with harbors and it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:14.140 
there will be ships with harbors and it
is<00:04:11.090> it<00:04:11.359> is<00:04:11.510> so<00:04:11.780> or<00:04:12.019> harbour<00:04:12.380> with<00:04:12.530> chips<00:04:12.769> and<00:04:13.150> it

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.150 
is it is so or harbour with chips and it

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.199 
is it is so or harbour with chips and it
is<00:04:14.329> something<00:04:14.870> that<00:04:15.319> we<00:04:15.950> feel<00:04:15.980> that<00:04:16.639> we<00:04:17.030> know

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
is something that we feel that we know

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:18.759 
is something that we feel that we know
how<00:04:17.419> to<00:04:17.479> do<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.989> now<00:04:18.109> it's<00:04:18.139> gonna<00:04:18.440> be<00:04:18.620> like<00:04:18.739> a

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
how to do and now it's gonna be like a

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:22.510 
how to do and now it's gonna be like a
simplified<00:04:19.510> version<00:04:20.510> of<00:04:21.070> those<00:04:22.070> earlier

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:22.520 
simplified version of those earlier

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.180 
simplified version of those earlier
games<00:04:22.789> also<00:04:23.120> present<00:04:23.720> in<00:04:23.930> in<00:04:24.289> in<00:04:24.710> this<00:04:24.979> one

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
games also present in in in this one

games also present in in in this one
also<00:04:26.060> one<00:04:26.360> thing<00:04:26.570> that<00:04:26.750> I<00:04:26.780> are<00:04:27.229> struck<00:04:27.500> of<00:04:27.650> is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
also one thing that I are struck of is

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.730 
also one thing that I are struck of is
just<00:04:27.979> economy<00:04:28.389> because<00:04:29.389> there<00:04:30.229> seems<00:04:30.470> to<00:04:30.560> be<00:04:30.650> a

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
just economy because there seems to be a

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.830 
just economy because there seems to be a
really<00:04:31.010> deep<00:04:31.280> economy<00:04:31.970> system<00:04:32.300> in<00:04:32.419> there<00:04:32.630> and

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
really deep economy system in there and

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.279 
really deep economy system in there and

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:38.350 
with taxes and all of that and and a lot
of<00:04:36.320> micromanaging<00:04:37.220> that's<00:04:37.460> possible<00:04:37.970> but<00:04:38.210> you

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 
of micromanaging that's possible but you

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:39.940 
of micromanaging that's possible but you
can<00:04:38.510> also<00:04:38.660> sort<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.260> and<00:04:39.710> you<00:04:39.800> have

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
can also sort of and and you have

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:42.460 
can also sort of and and you have
policies<00:04:40.520> in<00:04:40.550> there<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:41.000> well<00:04:41.180> which<00:04:41.539> is<00:04:41.570> also

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
policies in there as well which is also

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:43.930 
policies in there as well which is also
helping<00:04:43.220> you<00:04:43.370> shape<00:04:43.639> different

helping you shape different

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.629 
helping you shape different
neighborhoods<00:04:44.950> develop<00:04:45.950> a<00:04:45.979> little<00:04:46.340> bit<00:04:46.460> about

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:46.639 
neighborhoods develop a little bit about

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:47.950 
neighborhoods develop a little bit about
what<00:04:47.000> what<00:04:47.419> that's<00:04:47.660> about

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
what what that's about

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.250 
what what that's about
so<00:04:48.620> basically<00:04:49.070> the<00:04:49.460> basic<00:04:50.270> features<00:04:50.780> are<00:04:51.020> the

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:51.260 
so basically the basic features are the

policy<00:05:19.280> that<00:05:19.730> kind<00:05:20.390> of<00:05:20.450> gate<00:05:20.660> caters<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.110> to

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
policy that kind of gate caters to to

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.970 
policy that kind of gate caters to to
the<00:05:22.160> land<00:05:23.150> landscape<00:05:23.900> of<00:05:24.110> the<00:05:24.350> of<00:05:24.500> the<00:05:24.680> map<00:05:24.830> as

the land landscape of the of the map as

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:30.600 
the land landscape of the of the map as
well<00:05:25.130> and<00:05:25.900> there's<00:05:28.450> also<00:05:29.450> more<00:05:29.750> casual

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
well and there's also more casual

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.090 
well and there's also more casual
policies<00:05:31.610> like<00:05:31.970> pet<00:05:32.180> ban<00:05:32.420> for<00:05:32.720> example<00:05:33.260> that

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:34.100 
policies like pet ban for example that

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.010 
policies like pet ban for example that
will<00:05:34.310> affect<00:05:34.820> the<00:05:34.910> gameplay<00:05:35.390> but<00:05:35.420> just<00:05:35.900> a

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
will affect the gameplay but just a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.960 
will affect the gameplay but just a
little<00:05:36.140> bit<00:05:36.440> and<00:05:36.710> these<00:05:37.310> are<00:05:37.550> the<00:05:37.610> things<00:05:37.850> that

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
little bit and these are the things that

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.060 
little bit and these are the things that
the<00:05:38.180> player<00:05:38.360> can<00:05:38.630> choose<00:05:38.660> that<00:05:39.290> if<00:05:39.500> they<00:05:39.890> want

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:40.070 
the player can choose that if they want

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:42.340 
the player can choose that if they want
to<00:05:40.190> get<00:05:40.310> into<00:05:40.640> that<00:05:40.760> or<00:05:41.000> not<00:05:41.240> for<00:05:41.720> the<00:05:41.960> economy

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
to get into that or not for the economy

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.830 
to get into that or not for the economy
I<00:05:42.800> have<00:05:43.190> to<00:05:43.400> say<00:05:43.550> that<00:05:43.820> sometimes<00:05:44.510> in<00:05:44.690> these

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
I have to say that sometimes in these

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.860 
I have to say that sometimes in these
games<00:05:45.140> the<00:05:45.290> economy<00:05:45.710> can<00:05:45.950> be<00:05:46.130> really<00:05:46.580> really

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:46.870 
games the economy can be really really

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:51.370 
games the economy can be really really
kind<00:05:47.870> of<00:05:48.220> difficult<00:05:49.220> to<00:05:49.280> grasp<00:05:49.660> we<00:05:50.660> we<00:05:51.080> try<00:05:51.320> to

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
kind of difficult to grasp we we try to

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:52.930 
kind of difficult to grasp we we try to
make<00:05:51.620> it<00:05:51.770> as<00:05:51.890> simple<00:05:52.100> as<00:05:52.280> possible<00:05:52.490> in<00:05:52.850> the

make it as simple as possible in the
sense<00:05:53.150> that<00:05:53.240> you're<00:05:53.450> basically<00:05:53.870> setting<00:05:54.110> the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
sense that you're basically setting the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.650 
sense that you're basically setting the
taxes<00:05:54.860> and<00:05:55.130> then<00:05:55.640> budgeting<00:05:56.090> different<00:05:56.480> city

interface really user friendly and there

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.370 
interface really user friendly and there
will<00:06:02.060> be<00:06:02.090> a<00:06:02.210> lot<00:06:02.360> of<00:06:02.450> information<00:06:03.110> for<00:06:03.260> the
