with<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.590> continuous<00:02:29.220> line<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.730> they're

00:02:29.809 --> 00:02:29.819 
with the continuous line and they're

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:32.930 
with the continuous line and they're
just<00:02:29.940> hitching<00:02:30.180> around<00:02:30.569> it<00:02:31.250> so<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.610> majority

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
hardware store we picked up a photocopy

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.220 
hardware store we picked up a photocopy
of<00:03:24.360> a<00:03:24.510> map<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:25.019> was<00:03:25.530> left<00:03:26.180> two-sided<00:03:27.230> very

at the end of last year going southbound
that<00:03:34.440> said<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:34.799> he<00:03:34.980> said<00:03:35.159> works<00:03:35.370> really<00:03:35.519> well

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
that said that he said works really well

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.830 
that said that he said works really well
so<00:03:36.299> we<00:03:36.360> have<00:03:36.480> that<00:03:36.569> map<00:03:36.780> we<00:03:37.650> also<00:03:37.830> have<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.840> map

has
only<00:04:16.840> a<00:04:16.870> small<00:04:17.170> section<00:04:17.440> of<00:04:17.650> the<00:04:17.770> trail<00:04:17.980> in<00:04:18.160> it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.970 
but also show some roads that I can walk
around<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.490> the<00:04:21.940> problem<00:04:22.300> is<00:04:22.390> not<00:04:22.860> where<00:04:23.860> to

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:23.980 
around and the problem is not where to

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:26.330 
around and the problem is not where to
walk<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.580> on<00:04:24.700> what<00:04:24.910> roads<00:04:25.150> are<00:04:25.420> safe<00:04:25.690> but<00:04:26.050> it's

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
walk and on what roads are safe but it's

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.680 
walk and on what roads are safe but it's
where<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.460> walk<00:04:27.670> so<00:04:27.970> that<00:04:28.120> you<00:04:28.270> know<00:04:28.420> you<00:04:28.480> have

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
where to walk so that you know you have

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:31.010 
where to walk so that you know you have
water<00:04:28.960> sources<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:30.070> know<00:04:30.220> you<00:04:30.280> have<00:04:30.520> a

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:31.020 
water sources and you know you have a

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:35.610 
water sources and you know you have a
safe<00:04:32.020> and<00:04:32.320> legal<00:04:32.680> place<00:04:33.070> to<00:04:33.250> camp<00:04:33.490> and<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.620> it's

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
safe and legal place to camp and so it's

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:36.840 
safe and legal place to camp and so it's
become<00:04:35.920> a<00:04:35.950> real<00:04:36.130> challenge<00:04:36.400> I've<00:04:36.730> been

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
become a real challenge I've been

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.600 
become a real challenge I've been
studying<00:04:37.150> all<00:04:37.660> this<00:04:38.290> for<00:04:38.740> the<00:04:39.010> last<00:04:39.160> few<00:04:39.430> hours

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
studying all this for the last few hours

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:41.700 
studying all this for the last few hours
really<00:04:40.540> trying<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.900> decide<00:04:41.200> what<00:04:41.500> my<00:04:41.650> game

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:41.710 
really trying to decide what my game

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:43.800 
really trying to decide what my game
plan<00:04:41.890> is<00:04:42.190> going<00:04:42.400> to<00:04:42.460> be<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:42.970> I<00:04:43.330> think<00:04:43.360> I<00:04:43.630> have

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
plan is going to be and I think I have

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.370 
plan is going to be and I think I have
one<00:04:44.080> but<00:04:44.460> who<00:04:45.460> knows<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.900> going<00:04:47.140> to<00:04:47.200> be<00:04:47.290> an

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:47.380 
one but who knows it's going to be an

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:50.550 
one but who knows it's going to be an
interesting<00:04:47.620> two<00:04:48.250> or<00:04:48.400> three<00:04:48.580> days<00:04:48.610> I<00:04:49.090> think<00:04:49.560> to

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
interesting two or three days I think to

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.740 
interesting two or three days I think to
Agua<00:04:50.860> Dulce<00:04:51.010> which<00:04:51.520> is<00:04:51.670> at<00:04:52.240> the<00:04:52.390> end<00:04:52.510> of<00:04:52.630> the

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
Agua Dulce which is at the end of the

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:54.570 
Agua Dulce which is at the end of the
rear<00:04:52.930> out<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.410> I<00:04:53.680> think<00:04:53.920> once<00:04:54.070> I'm<00:04:54.250> there<00:04:54.430> I'll

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
rear out and I think once I'm there I'll

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:57.420 
rear out and I think once I'm there I'll
feel<00:04:54.760> a<00:04:54.790> lot<00:04:54.880> better<00:04:55.180> but<00:04:55.920> one<00:04:56.920> challenge<00:04:57.280> at<00:04:57.370> a

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
feel a lot better but one challenge at a

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.880 
feel a lot better but one challenge at a
time<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:58.000> so<00:04:58.480> this<00:04:58.630> is<00:04:58.720> a<00:04:58.750> long<00:04:59.260> update<00:04:59.650> but

00:04:59.880 --> 00:04:59.890 
time and so this is a long update but

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.340 
time and so this is a long update but
long<00:05:00.700> story<00:05:00.730> short<00:05:01.090> is<00:05:01.480> is<00:05:01.660> I've<00:05:01.990> really

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350
