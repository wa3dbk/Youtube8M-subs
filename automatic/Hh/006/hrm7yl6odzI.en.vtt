00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.779
 send 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.500
 who are you and what kind of car do you have 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.480
 taken along 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.670
 my name is dirk van dijck i have one 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.879
 volvo p 1801 included 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.320
 my property since 98 very nice car 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.199
 has a childhood dream 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.930
 when i got it when i could buy it and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.239
 the engine was completely overhauled in 2007 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.970
 and I'm actually very curious if that 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.949
 his 120hp would not be according to the booklets 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.680
 I still have to have 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.360
 it is not he is originally american 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.330
 and he is also in favor of that legislation 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.800
 adjusted in terms of emissions and it is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.410
 therefore running on gas is adjusted 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.800
 maybe he just has it really bad 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.800
 you 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 I'm supposedly making google weakness 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.230
 is 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.770
 every no grape brown machine 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:08.770
 could claim rights 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:13.430
 beautiful bird coupe from the seventies 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.280
 does it still what promised in the 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.780
 it used to be that despite that 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.600
 a 41 year old age 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 then he still does it extraordinary 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.590
 good motion has of course been revised 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.710
 We have tested on LPG and on gasoline 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.380
 there is a substantial difference between them 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.200
 gasoline comes to a good 116 hp and 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:36.410
 135 new to be measured actually still 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.990
 just say what he should do on it 

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:41.750
 lpg and then there are only 85 parkas left 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:44.000
 and I think 2020 will avoid him for 25 hours 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:45.830
 in the so then your new social is 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.750
 if that should be me they actually are 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:49.940
 a kind of sports mode letter 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.959
 which petrol functions yes then you can 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.890
 exercise or normally with the two of you 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.360
 two very different measurements 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.120
 results you hate expected 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.160
 yes yes actually it surprises that 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.060
 gasoline as close to the original 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.380
 would like to come 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.180
 I drive more often on gas 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:09.019
 because very much smoother runs less 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.180
 less wispy so a fact I use 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.010
 also never the power and has today 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:14.000
 He toured to lie in recent years 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.980
 really did not see 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.680
 where was very nice and nice too 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.680
 see that the motor is healthy thank you so much
