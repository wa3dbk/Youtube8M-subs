you a little bit about how to profile

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.829 
you a little bit about how to profile
and<00:00:05.520> then<00:00:06.120> we're<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.359> to<00:00:06.390> go<00:00:06.509> in<00:00:06.660> and<00:00:06.750> we're

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
and then we're going to go in and we're

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.740 
and then we're going to go in and we're
going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> profile<00:00:07.500> this<00:00:07.649> blade<00:00:08.120> and<00:00:09.120> get<00:00:09.630> it

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
going to profile this blade and get it

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:17.000 
going to profile this blade and get it
to<00:00:10.590> its<00:00:10.620> final<00:00:11.040> shape<00:00:14.330> now<00:00:15.330> first<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.839> all<00:00:16.010> what

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
to its final shape now first of all what

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.870 
to its final shape now first of all what
you<00:00:17.190> can<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:18.529> the<00:00:19.529> corners<00:00:19.980> of<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.279> wheel<00:00:20.460> here

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
you can do the corners of the wheel here

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.820 
you can do the corners of the wheel here
are<00:00:21.510> one<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.750> your<00:00:21.869> biggest<00:00:22.050> assets<00:00:22.650> from

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
are one of your biggest assets from

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.370 
are one of your biggest assets from
removing<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.369> most<00:00:23.580> material<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:25.199> can

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
removing the most material you can

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.500 
removing the most material you can
really<00:00:25.619> push<00:00:25.830> into<00:00:26.039> the<00:00:26.189> corner<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:26.730> remove<00:00:27.390> a

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
really push into the corner and remove a

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.390 
really push into the corner and remove a
lot<00:00:27.720> because<00:00:28.289> when<00:00:28.590> you<00:00:28.680> push<00:00:28.890> into<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.220> whole

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
lot because when you push into the whole

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.859 
lot because when you push into the whole
belt<00:00:29.670> itself<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.269> creates<00:00:30.570> quite<00:00:30.810> a

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
belt itself it creates quite a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.500 
belt itself it creates quite a
resistance<00:00:31.439> and<00:00:32.309> doesn't<00:00:32.579> remove<00:00:32.820> material

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
resistance and doesn't remove material

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.360 
resistance and doesn't remove material
as<00:00:33.600> fashion<00:00:34.079> you'll<00:00:34.170> notice<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.710> as<00:00:34.920> I

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
as fashion you'll notice that as I

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.090 
as fashion you'll notice that as I
remove<00:00:35.640> these<00:00:35.820> larger<00:00:36.329> sections<00:00:36.840> I'll<00:00:37.800> really

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
remove these larger sections I'll really

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.770 
remove these larger sections I'll really
rely<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.460> lot<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:39.059> corner<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.600> wheel

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
rely a lot on the corner of the wheel

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.200 
rely a lot on the corner of the wheel
and<00:00:40.500> when<00:00:40.770> you<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.010> rely<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.610> corner<00:00:42.030> of<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
and when you do rely on a corner of the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.729 
and when you do rely on a corner of the
wheel<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.540> want<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.750> track<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.079> belt<00:00:43.469> a

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
wheel you want to track the belt a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.880 
wheel you want to track the belt a
little<00:00:44.219> bit<00:00:44.340> over<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.120> corner<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> wheel

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
little bit over that corner of the wheel

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.470 
little bit over that corner of the wheel
see<00:00:46.890> they<00:00:47.039> don't<00:00:47.100> run<00:00:47.340> into<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.789> into<00:00:48.360> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
see they don't run into the into the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.479 
see they don't run into the into the
rubber<00:00:49.190> which<00:00:50.190> will<00:00:50.370> destroy<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:50.969> wheel<00:00:51.410> so

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
rubber which will destroy the wheel so

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.010 
rubber which will destroy the wheel so
I'll<00:00:53.489> start<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.149> and<00:00:54.360> we'll<00:00:54.570> adjust<00:00:54.870> the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
I'll start this up and we'll adjust the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:37.890 
I'll start this up and we'll adjust the
tracking<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.590> we'll<00:00:55.890> get<00:00:55.980> started

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:37.900 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.960 

as<00:01:38.470> you<00:01:38.650> can<00:01:38.770> see<00:01:38.980> it's<00:01:39.160> taken<00:01:39.490> off<00:01:39.610> quite<00:01:39.640> a

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
as you can see it's taken off quite a

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.250 
as you can see it's taken off quite a
bit

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
bit

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.110 
bit
and<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:42.040> just<00:01:42.190> continue<00:01:42.340> doing<00:01:42.880> that<00:01:42.970> around

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
and you just continue doing that around

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.630 
and you just continue doing that around
until<00:01:43.810> you<00:01:43.930> bring<00:01:44.140> the<00:01:44.350> metal<00:01:44.500> into<00:01:45.430> these

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
until you bring the metal into these

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.890 
until you bring the metal into these
lines<00:01:45.970> that<00:01:46.300> you<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.140> drawn<00:01:47.530> so<00:01:48.400> all<00:01:48.810> grind<00:01:49.810> a

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
lines that you have drawn so all grind a

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.870 
lines that you have drawn so all grind a
little<00:01:50.140> bit<00:01:50.260> more<00:01:50.530> out<00:01:51.130> here<00:01:51.160> in<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:51.580> finger

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
little bit more out here in this finger

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.480 
little bit more out here in this finger
cut<00:01:52.060> out<00:01:52.210> and<00:01:52.450> then<00:01:53.110> bring<00:01:53.650> this<00:01:53.800> down<00:01:54.070> to<00:01:54.280> this

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
cut out and then bring this down to this

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.660 
cut out and then bring this down to this
edge<00:01:55.860> make<00:01:56.860> sure<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.070> wear<00:01:57.360> safety<00:01:58.360> goggles
