 soldier food is one of the most 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.820
 conservative areas of military affairs but 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.640
 developments are underway in this area and 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.270
 based on advanced technology last 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.619

 until recently it was 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.339
 ordinary cardboard box in which 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.250
 there were a few cans of canned food 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:05.880

 individual diets and although 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.200
 the basis of them are all the same bread porridge 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 and the stew is fundamentally different 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.540
 product both in taste and in their 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:35.689
 practical properties first thing 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.689
 distinguishes modern suhpaya this packaging 

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:43.870
 packaging is a polymer 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:47.680
 box of multilayer 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:50.260
 polymer material where laid 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:53.560
 certain qualities above all 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:58.150
 protect the products that are contained 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:02:00.390

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.390
 Wednesday 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.010
 also she protects 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:09.270
 products that are here from 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:13.630
 Radiation exposure chemical bar 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:17.500
 bacteriological weapons this packaging 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:22.810
 does not sink has strong mechanical 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.390
 most common properties 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.420

 fighters during field walks and exercises 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.000
 box rpp is divided into three compartments in 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.239

 natural product that supports
