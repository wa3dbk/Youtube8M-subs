feel here's a thing with made in Taiwan
and<00:01:06.700> I<00:01:07.700> guess<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:09.100> writing<00:01:10.100> is<00:01:10.250> Japanese<00:01:10.970> I<00:01:11.420> am

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
and I guess the writing is Japanese I am

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.230

it<00:01:17.630> says<00:01:17.900> mush<00:01:18.410> moshi<00:01:18.830> or<00:01:19.280> something<00:01:19.910> like

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
and I think it's really expanded

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.530 
and I think it's really expanded
expensive<00:03:24.110> for<00:03:24.350> me<00:03:24.470> expand<00:03:25.070> if<00:03:25.220> how<00:03:25.580> expensive

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
expensive for me expand if how expensive

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.440 
expensive for me expand if how expensive
for<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:28.430> cost<00:03:28.790> me<00:03:29.090> four<00:03:29.720> euros<00:03:30.230> i<00:03:30.770> believe<00:03:31.130> and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:31.450 
for it cost me four euros i believe and

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:34.330 
for it cost me four euros i believe and
for<00:03:32.450> only<00:03:32.630> six<00:03:33.110> of<00:03:33.260> them<00:03:33.500> I<00:03:33.709> think<00:03:34.040> it's<00:03:34.190> really

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
for only six of them I think it's really

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.100 
for only six of them I think it's really
expensive<00:03:34.670> and<00:03:35.470> it<00:03:36.470> comes<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:38.150> Moshi<00:03:38.360> car<00:03:38.720> is

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:39.110 
expensive and it comes the Moshi car is

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.620 
expensive and it comes the Moshi car is
in<00:03:39.920> a<00:03:40.340> kind<00:03:40.850> of<00:03:40.940> cupcake<00:03:43.630> paper<00:03:44.630> thing<00:03:45.080> and

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
in a kind of cupcake paper thing and

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.300 
in a kind of cupcake paper thing and
this<00:03:47.630> is<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:47.930> motion<00:03:49.690> it<00:03:50.690> has<00:03:51.530> some<00:03:51.709> sugar

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
this is the motion it has some sugar

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.620 
this is the motion it has some sugar
power<00:03:52.790> sugar<00:03:53.660> powder<00:03:53.930> on<00:03:54.410> it<00:03:55.360> because<00:03:56.360> it's

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:56.630 
power sugar powder on it because it's

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:00.190 
power sugar powder on it because it's
very<00:03:57.110> sticky<00:03:57.500> and<00:03:57.860> I<00:03:58.220> guess<00:03:58.790> then<00:03:59.060> it's<00:03:59.360> will

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
very sticky and I guess then it's will

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.940 
very sticky and I guess then it's will
not<00:04:00.380> stick<00:04:00.769> on<00:04:00.950> your<00:04:01.070> hands<00:04:02.440> so<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.470> will<00:04:03.800> buy
