00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.170 
much nice but I think what they're
trying<00:04:43.470> to<00:04:43.530> get<00:04:43.710> out<00:04:43.770> here<00:04:44.130> is<00:04:44.400> they<00:04:44.970> don't

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:45.180 
trying to get out here is they don't

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.550
