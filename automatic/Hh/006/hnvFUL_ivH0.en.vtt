of eyeshadow and all right so apply
there<00:03:04.819> right<00:03:05.560> on<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:07.220> line<00:03:07.430> of<00:03:07.580> demarcation

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.360 

it's<00:03:13.400> like<00:03:13.549> a<00:03:13.579> little<00:03:13.910> line<00:03:15.010> and<00:03:16.010> I<00:03:16.040> like<00:03:16.220> to

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
it's like a little line and I like to

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.069 
it's like a little line and I like to
use<00:03:16.579> a<00:03:17.680> taupe<00:03:18.680> color<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:20.269> color<00:03:20.510> matches<00:03:20.930> my

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:21.079 
use a taupe color that color matches my

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:23.080 
use a taupe color that color matches my
Scout<00:03:21.380> better<00:03:21.680> most<00:03:22.400> people<00:03:22.700> would<00:03:22.850> like<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
Scout better most people would like to

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:27.250 
Scout better most people would like to
go<00:03:23.510> it<00:03:23.780> on<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:26.060> know<00:03:26.239> this<00:03:26.450> internal<00:03:27.140> but

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:27.260 
go it on you know this internal but

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.500 
go it on you know this internal but
that's<00:03:27.470> not<00:03:27.769> right<00:03:28.190> because<00:03:28.250> your<00:03:28.850> scalp<00:03:29.209> is

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
that's not right because your scalp is

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.580 
that's not right because your scalp is
way<00:03:30.410> lighter<00:03:30.920> than<00:03:31.100> your<00:03:31.459> actual<00:03:31.700> skin<00:03:32.180> tone

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
way lighter than your actual skin tone

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.599 
way lighter than your actual skin tone
so<00:03:33.590> I<00:03:33.620> just<00:03:33.950> like<00:03:34.100> to<00:03:34.310> apply<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.790> right<00:03:35.090> there

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
so I just like to apply that right there

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.610 
so I just like to apply that right there
and<00:03:37.609> you<00:03:37.880> can<00:03:37.910> bring<00:03:38.299> it<00:03:38.450> back<00:03:38.600> into<00:03:38.870> your<00:03:39.140> part

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:41.620 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.349 

and<00:03:42.620> then<00:03:43.160> that<00:03:43.430> will<00:03:43.609> help<00:03:43.730> your<00:03:44.060> closure

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
and then that will help your closure

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:48.610 
and then that will help your closure
blend<00:03:45.019> perfect<00:03:46.780> like<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.930> had<00:03:48.140> in<00:03:48.230> my<00:03:48.350> last
