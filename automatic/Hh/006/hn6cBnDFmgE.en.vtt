00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 
and then the aqua aqua 4s and it is like

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.360 
and then the aqua aqua 4s and it is like
I'm<00:01:51.660> sure<00:01:51.900> if<00:01:51.960> I<00:01:52.110> said<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.500> now<00:01:52.680> applaud<00:01:53.130> but

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
I'm sure if I said right now applaud but

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.780 
I'm sure if I said right now applaud but
it<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.730> like<00:01:53.940> a<00:01:54.530> half<00:01:55.530> millimeter<00:01:56.190> or<00:01:56.430> like<00:01:56.580> one

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
it is like a half millimeter or like one

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.910 
it is like a half millimeter or like one
millimeter<00:01:57.210> thinner<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.350> gal<00:01:58.530> attest<00:01:58.770> to

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
millimeter thinner and my gal attest to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.860 
millimeter thinner and my gal attest to
it<00:01:59.100> feels<00:01:59.340> like<00:01:59.520> so<00:02:00.210> there's<00:02:00.479> also<00:02:00.630> something

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and something that also might want to

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.889 
and something that also might want to
know<00:02:06.570> is<00:02:06.780> that<00:02:07.369> now<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.399> unforced<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.780> know

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
know is that now the unforced you know

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.960 
know is that now the unforced you know
hello<00:02:10.500> people<00:02:10.860> said<00:02:11.220> that<00:02:11.340> they<00:02:11.400> like<00:02:11.820> the

hello people said that they like the
feeling<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.510> gets<00:02:12.780> exclusive<00:02:13.200> is<00:02:13.530> like

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
feeling of it gets exclusive is like

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.430 
feeling of it gets exclusive is like
heavy<00:02:13.950> and<00:02:14.600> it<00:02:15.600> weighs<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:15.990> I<00:02:16.200> think<00:02:16.230> like

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
heavy and it weighs like I think like

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.920 
heavy and it weighs like I think like
140<00:02:17.310> foreground<00:02:17.760> something<00:02:18.150> like<00:02:18.240> that<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
140 foreground something like that and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.540 
140 foreground something like that and
now<00:02:19.080> I'm<00:02:19.200> coming<00:02:19.440> an<00:02:19.500> iphone<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:20.310> it's

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
now I'm coming an iphone like it's

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:24.650 
now I'm coming an iphone like it's
bigger<00:02:21.080> but<00:02:22.080> it's<00:02:22.380> slider<00:02:22.709> so<00:02:23.520> I'm<00:02:24.150> sure<00:02:24.510> if

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
bigger but it's slider so I'm sure if

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.449 
bigger but it's slider so I'm sure if
it's<00:02:24.810> still<00:02:25.020> gonna<00:02:25.200> have<00:02:25.440> a<00:02:25.470> exclusive<00:02:26.010> feel

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
it's still gonna have a exclusive feel

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.880 
it's still gonna have a exclusive feel
more<00:02:26.760> people<00:02:27.180> even<00:02:27.360> talking<00:02:27.750> most<00:02:28.020> people<00:02:28.410> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
more people even talking most people you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.380 
more people even talking most people you
know<00:02:29.040> you<00:02:29.190> just<00:02:29.250> get<00:02:29.489> used<00:02:29.700> to<00:02:29.910> it<00:02:30.000> they<00:02:30.180> don't

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
know you just get used to it they don't

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.720 
know you just get used to it they don't
think<00:02:30.780> about<00:02:30.900> it<00:02:31.260> gets<00:02:31.680> like<00:02:31.860> after<00:02:32.370> using

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
think about it gets like after using

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.180 
think about it gets like after using
that<00:02:32.970> for<00:02:33.300> a<00:02:33.450> few<00:02:33.600> days<00:02:33.750> the<00:02:34.560> item<00:02:34.980> for<00:02:35.160> us

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
that for a few days the item for us

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.430 
that for a few days the item for us
really<00:02:35.640> probably<00:02:36.060> feel<00:02:36.480> like<00:02:36.630> a<00:02:36.660> break<00:02:36.989> it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
really probably feel like a break it

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.140 
really probably feel like a break it
really<00:02:37.680> feels<00:02:37.890> like<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.160> break<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.610> me<00:02:38.760> like<00:02:39.000> a

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
really feels like a break for me like a

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.110 
really feels like a break for me like a
extremely<00:02:39.840> neck<00:02:40.200> heavy<00:02:40.500> break<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.160> now<00:02:42.060> the

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
extremely neck heavy break and now the

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.780 
extremely neck heavy break and now the
dolphin<00:02:42.840> five<00:02:43.620> also<00:02:44.280> feels<00:02:44.489> like<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.670> brick

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
dolphin five also feels like a brick

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.000 
dolphin five also feels like a brick
communicates<00:02:45.360> like<00:02:45.540> it's<00:02:45.750> still<00:02:45.989> like<00:02:46.350> small

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
communicates like it's still like small

you<00:02:56.700> know<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.120> works<00:02:57.420> good<00:02:57.600> good<00:02:57.810> like<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.440> mean

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
you know it works good good like I mean

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.860 
you know it works good good like I mean
like<00:02:58.769> 19<00:02:59.280> I<00:02:59.370> think<00:02:59.400> nonsense<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.420> like<00:03:00.690> it

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
like 19 I think nonsense will like it

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.360 
like 19 I think nonsense will like it
more<00:03:01.110> I<00:03:01.799> I<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.910> only<00:03:03.030> assume<00:03:03.209> and<00:03:03.720> then<00:03:04.410> die

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
more I I can only assume and then die

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.000 
more I I can only assume and then die
for<00:03:05.610> pot<00:03:05.790> so<00:03:06.110> that's<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.200> second<00:03:07.560> thing<00:03:07.590> i

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
for pot so that's the second thing i

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:12.289 
for pot so that's the second thing i
like<00:03:08.910> about<00:03:09.120> an<00:03:09.360> hour<00:03:09.450> 55<00:03:09.900> now<00:03:10.620> 13<00:03:11.549> is<00:03:11.790> to<00:03:11.910> apple

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
like about an hour 55 now 13 is to apple

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.560 
like about an hour 55 now 13 is to apple
a6<00:03:12.510> so<00:03:13.019> they<00:03:13.230> improve<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.769> processor<00:03:14.480> from<00:03:15.480> a

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
a6 so they improve the processor from a

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:18.140 
a6 so they improve the processor from a
half<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.989> 85<00:03:16.350> like<00:03:16.650> halfway<00:03:16.829> six<00:03:17.220> hey<00:03:17.670> I<00:03:17.700> think

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
half of 85 like halfway six hey I think

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.660 
half of 85 like halfway six hey I think
it's<00:03:18.329> like<00:03:18.480> higher<00:03:18.810> cloth<00:03:19.470> Juke<00:03:19.920> or<00:03:20.250> something

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
it's like higher cloth Juke or something

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.440 
it's like higher cloth Juke or something
and<00:03:20.930> it's<00:03:21.930> better<00:03:22.350> than<00:03:22.709> and<00:03:23.160> processor<00:03:23.910> with

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:24.450 
and it's better than and processor with

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.479 
and it's better than and processor with
the<00:03:24.780> processor<00:03:25.350> in<00:03:25.650> name<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:28.470> ipad<00:03:29.070> 13

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
the processor in name the ipad 13

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.580 
the processor in name the ipad 13
erosion<00:03:29.880> and<00:03:30.090> i<00:03:30.750> forgot<00:03:30.989> earlier<00:03:31.200> this<00:03:31.530> year

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
erosion and i forgot earlier this year

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:34.910 
erosion and i forgot earlier this year
it<00:03:32.010> was<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.250> 80<00:03:32.489> x<00:03:32.760> so<00:03:33.450> they<00:03:33.630> did<00:03:34.140> a<00:03:34.200> better

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
it was the 80 x so they did a better

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.160 
it was the 80 x so they did a better
improvement<00:03:35.400> not<00:03:35.760> safe<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.239> X<00:03:36.420> but<00:03:36.690> now<00:03:36.930> it's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
improvement not safe of X but now it's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.610 
improvement not safe of X but now it's
finally<00:03:37.380> was<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.850> six<00:03:38.850> that<00:03:39.390> the<00:03:39.570> day<00:03:39.750> I'm<00:03:40.560> a

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
finally was a six that the day I'm a

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.319 
finally was a six that the day I'm a
real<00:03:40.920> sure<00:03:41.220> with<00:03:41.370> what<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.760> differences<00:03:42.150> but

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
real sure with what the differences but

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:44.780 
real sure with what the differences but
it<00:03:42.540> should<00:03:42.870> mean<00:03:43.320> like<00:03:43.709> better<00:03:44.100> graphics<00:03:44.610> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
it should mean like better graphics and
