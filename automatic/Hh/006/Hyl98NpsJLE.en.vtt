00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980

never take it to the end of your eye

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.670 
never take it to the end of your eye
either<00:04:05.360> because<00:04:05.630> it<00:04:05.720> looks<00:04:05.900> pretty<00:04:05.960> fake<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:06.680 
either because it looks pretty fake and

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.250 
either because it looks pretty fake and
then<00:04:07.280> when<00:04:07.460> you're<00:04:07.580> blending<00:04:08.420> it<00:04:08.750> in<00:04:08.840> I<00:04:09.110> could

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
then when you're blending it in I could

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.690 
then when you're blending it in I could
just<00:04:09.410> use<00:04:09.560> my<00:04:09.590> fingertips<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.430> you<00:04:10.940> Pat<00:04:11.240> it<00:04:11.450> in

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
just use my fingertips and you Pat it in

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.730 
just use my fingertips and you Pat it in
instead<00:04:13.700> of<00:04:13.850> rubbing<00:04:14.750> it<00:04:14.990> away<00:04:15.230> because<00:04:15.590> it

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:15.740 
instead of rubbing it away because it

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.979 
instead of rubbing it away because it
stays<00:04:16.100> on<00:04:16.130> for<00:04:16.310> a<00:04:16.520> lot<00:04:16.609> longer<00:04:16.760> that<00:04:16.970> way<00:04:17.239> so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
stays on for a lot longer that way so

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.420 
stays on for a lot longer that way so
you<00:04:18.020> literally<00:04:18.410> are<00:04:18.560> just<00:04:18.590> patting<00:04:19.190> it<00:04:19.280> in

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:19.430 
you literally are just patting it in

you literally are just patting it in
your<00:04:20.270> face<00:04:20.620> and<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:22.160> warmth<00:04:22.520> on<00:04:22.730> your

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
fingertip Germany blends it in quite

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.150 
fingertip Germany blends it in quite
well

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.770 

hopefully<00:04:30.820> it's<00:04:30.940> gonna<00:04:31.180> make<00:04:31.360> me<00:04:31.480> look<00:04:31.510> more

and<00:04:52.870> then<00:04:53.710> I'll<00:04:53.920> do<00:04:54.040> the<00:04:54.070> same<00:04:54.190> on<00:04:54.490> the<00:04:54.580> other

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
and then I'll do the same on the other

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:01.320 
and then I'll do the same on the other
side<00:04:57.390> and<00:04:58.680> then<00:04:59.680> you<00:05:00.010> just<00:05:00.310> want<00:05:00.910> to<00:05:01.030> go<00:05:01.180> around

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
side and then you just want to go around

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.310 
side and then you just want to go around
the<00:05:01.690> little<00:05:03.360> red<00:05:04.360> bits<00:05:04.600> of<00:05:04.750> your<00:05:04.900> nose<00:05:05.050> like

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.880 

the<00:05:09.890> trick<00:05:10.130> is<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.910> want<00:05:11.450> it<00:05:11.690> to<00:05:11.960> look<00:05:12.110> lighter

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
the trick is you want it to look lighter

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.300 
the trick is you want it to look lighter
in<00:05:13.340> middle<00:05:14.060> here<00:05:14.420> then<00:05:14.930> around<00:05:15.230> the<00:05:15.380> edges<00:05:15.770> so

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
in middle here then around the edges so

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.560 
in middle here then around the edges so
you<00:05:16.610> want<00:05:16.760> it<00:05:16.850> to<00:05:16.970> look<00:05:17.060> like<00:05:17.270> you're<00:05:17.420> holding

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:17.570 
you want it to look like you're holding

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:19.240 
you want it to look like you're holding
a<00:05:17.750> match<00:05:17.990> underneath<00:05:18.560> your<00:05:18.710> chin<00:05:18.920> and<00:05:19.130> it's

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
a match underneath your chin and it's

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:21.600 
a match underneath your chin and it's
lift<00:05:19.460> up<00:05:19.610> the<00:05:19.760> middle<00:05:20.000> of<00:05:20.060> your<00:05:20.180> face<00:05:20.360> here<00:05:20.690> so

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
lift up the middle of your face here so

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.460 
lift up the middle of your face here so

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:44.510 
number four which is the darker shade

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:47.860 
number four which is the darker shade
and<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.170> will<00:05:45.470> literally<00:05:45.920> just<00:05:46.910> go<00:05:47.240> all<00:05:47.540> the<00:05:47.840> way

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:47.870 
and I will literally just go all the way

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:51.340 
and I will literally just go all the way
around<00:05:48.710> my<00:05:49.520> face<00:05:49.760> in<00:05:50.090> the<00:05:50.210> darker<00:05:50.570> color<00:05:50.780> and<00:05:51.050> I

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
around my face in the darker color and I

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.900 
around my face in the darker color and I
don't<00:05:51.410> bother<00:05:51.740> mixing<00:05:52.400> this<00:05:52.520> in<00:05:52.730> with<00:05:52.880> my

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
don't bother mixing this in with my

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.820 
don't bother mixing this in with my
tinted<00:05:53.330> foundation<00:05:53.480> either<00:05:54.020> just<00:05:54.530> make<00:05:54.710> sure

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:54.830 
tinted foundation either just make sure

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.920 
tinted foundation either just make sure
that<00:05:54.920> you<00:05:55.100> don't<00:05:55.340> put<00:05:55.700> too<00:05:56.330> much<00:05:56.480> or<00:05:56.660> because

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
that you don't put too much or because

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:04.860 
that you don't put too much or because
you<00:05:56.990> don't<00:05:57.200> look<00:05:57.320> like<00:05:57.470> you've<00:05:57.740> caked<00:05:58.010> in

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:04.870 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:07.650 

okay<00:06:05.500> so<00:06:05.710> now<00:06:05.980> I've<00:06:06.100> done<00:06:06.220> that<00:06:06.450> and<00:06:07.450> pretty

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:07.660 
okay so now I've done that and pretty

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.390 
okay so now I've done that and pretty
much<00:06:07.810> finished<00:06:08.230> if<00:06:08.560> you<00:06:08.620> want<00:06:08.950> to<00:06:09.070> go<00:06:09.190> in

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
much finished if you want to go in

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:12.240 
much finished if you want to go in
lighter<00:06:09.910> in<00:06:10.210> the<00:06:10.300> middle<00:06:10.540> again<00:06:11.140> you<00:06:11.380> can<00:06:11.620> or

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
lighter in the middle again you can or

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.710 
lighter in the middle again you can or
build<00:06:12.640> it<00:06:12.790> up<00:06:12.850> so<00:06:13.120> that<00:06:13.150> it's<00:06:13.420> a<00:06:13.450> bit<00:06:13.480> more

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
build it up so that it's a bit more

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.720 
build it up so that it's a bit more
dramatic<00:06:13.870> so<00:06:14.650> that<00:06:14.800> it's<00:06:14.950> you<00:06:15.220> can<00:06:15.430> notice

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:15.730 
dramatic so that it's you can notice

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:18.060 
dramatic so that it's you can notice
like<00:06:15.880> the<00:06:16.060> dark<00:06:16.270> and<00:06:16.480> light<00:06:16.660> I<00:06:17.170> think<00:06:17.800> I'm<00:06:17.920> just

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
like the dark and light I think I'm just

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:21.000 
like the dark and light I think I'm just
gonna<00:06:18.220> pivot<00:06:18.520> more<00:06:19.330> of<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.900> lighter<00:06:20.140> in<00:06:20.890> the

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.010 
gonna pivot more of the lighter in the

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:25.540 
gonna pivot more of the lighter in the
middle

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:25.550 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:28.270 

so<00:06:26.060> that's<00:06:26.270> how<00:06:26.449> I've<00:06:26.960> been<00:06:27.289> taught<00:06:27.470> to<00:06:27.500> do<00:06:27.740> my

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:28.280 
so that's how I've been taught to do my

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.779 
so that's how I've been taught to do my
foundation<00:06:29.000> and<00:06:29.210> you<00:06:30.199> can<00:06:30.229> obviously<00:06:30.800> do<00:06:31.610> it

00:06:31.779 --> 00:06:31.789 
foundation and you can obviously do it

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:34.059 
foundation and you can obviously do it
with<00:06:32.060> just<00:06:32.690> foundation<00:06:33.110> and<00:06:33.380> not<00:06:33.560> mix<00:06:33.860> it<00:06:33.979> in

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:34.069 
with just foundation and not mix it in

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:36.460 
with just foundation and not mix it in
so<00:06:34.250> it's<00:06:34.430> not<00:06:35.000> tinted<00:06:35.389> moisturizer<00:06:35.960> if<00:06:36.289> you

00:06:36.460 --> 00:06:36.470 
so it's not tinted moisturizer if you

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.650 
so it's not tinted moisturizer if you
prefer<00:06:36.889> more<00:06:36.919> coverage<00:06:37.550> I<00:06:37.910> had<00:06:38.360> never<00:06:38.539> ever

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
prefer more coverage I had never ever

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.120 
prefer more coverage I had never ever
thought<00:06:38.990> that<00:06:39.050> I<00:06:39.289> would<00:06:39.380> wear<00:06:39.740> it<00:06:39.860> in<00:06:39.979> to

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
thought that I would wear it in to

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:41.740 
thought that I would wear it in to
moisturize<00:06:40.580> I've<00:06:40.729> always<00:06:41.120> been<00:06:41.270> a<00:06:41.539> full

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
moisturize I've always been a full

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.499 
moisturize I've always been a full
coverage<00:06:41.960> kind<00:06:42.440> of<00:06:42.530> girl<00:06:42.650> but<00:06:43.069> since<00:06:44.030> I<00:06:44.270> tried

00:06:44.499 --> 00:06:44.509 
coverage kind of girl but since I tried

00:06:44.509 --> 00:06:46.839 
coverage kind of girl but since I tried
it<00:06:44.720> I<00:06:44.930> wouldn't<00:06:45.349> go<00:06:45.440> back<00:06:45.470> my<00:06:46.220> skin's<00:06:46.490> been<00:06:46.669> so

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
it I wouldn't go back my skin's been so

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.850 
it I wouldn't go back my skin's been so
much<00:06:47.000> better<00:06:47.210> since<00:06:47.509> I've<00:06:47.930> been<00:06:48.080> wearing<00:06:48.229> less

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:48.860 
much better since I've been wearing less

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:50.980 
much better since I've been wearing less
foundation<00:06:49.819> I<00:06:50.060> just<00:06:50.419> think<00:06:50.539> it<00:06:50.630> looks<00:06:50.780> a<00:06:50.870> lot

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
foundation I just think it looks a lot

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.809 
foundation I just think it looks a lot
more<00:06:51.050> natural<00:06:51.169> it<00:06:51.919> just<00:06:52.130> looks<00:06:52.280> nicer<00:06:52.520> when

00:06:52.809 --> 00:06:52.819 
more natural it just looks nicer when

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:54.070 
more natural it just looks nicer when
you'd<00:06:52.940> look<00:06:53.180> like<00:06:53.360> you're<00:06:53.509> not<00:06:53.599> caked<00:06:53.870> and

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
you'd look like you're not caked and

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.080 
you'd look like you're not caked and
