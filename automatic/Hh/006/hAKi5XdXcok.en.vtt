00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.090
 I make myself sit down with superfoods are still simple field 

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:09.720
 extremely popular is very very good for you to put their shoe this summer one 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.869
 Bid made with Paul before it's just had a place 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.089
 and have it set as a real favorite of the 

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:19.960
 they are of it if you really record in something useful but to date it is 

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:21.390
 totally healthy 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.960
 I'm just going to make good 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.960
 let's do that 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.380
 we wanted to go super sports with all the risks of the chocolates 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.390
 that's his resistance 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.790
 we already have drivers without addition vs without sugar 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.030
 in later 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.630
 she can't either 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.240
 therefore it was 

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.990
 the hazelnuts 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.300
 yes you have meets is necessary with this radical you can buy at the xenos 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.980
 I think algerian April is a group of somewhat larger ice cubes 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.120
 terms of use 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 and you do not need anything to say nothing about her with which you do all the damage 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.030
 can go 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.680
 yes and why are those chocolates so incredibly super this is a few whole ones 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.760
 good things in it 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.570
 cacao cacao is good for your heart and blood vessels it became detoxifying on you 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.520
 liver 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.060
 it is also an art that you get a good mood from is always very bad 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.000
 pain 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.180
 and is full of antioxidants 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.149
 then we have this 

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.299
 coconut oil bouterse does not like closing time and that is very good for you 

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:32.570
 cholesterol levels 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.870
 it just doesn't say like many other facts 

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:40.390
 that is why I can also use different things you can of course 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.250
 use 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.400
 but I had already used oils as a massage as a kind of character 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:47.480
 very good for you from the coast 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.610
 is full of antioxidants 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.560
 there are substances in it that stimulate thyroid gland and that and then stimulates 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.770
 expected earlier 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.970
 yes and then we have a little extra 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.049
 there you have to shine this one of the most 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:04.569
 pre-registration flight hill value is full of all vitamins and 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.559
 minerals vitamin de p2 magnesium in recent years 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:13.789
 He has a lot more you have to close on just about all passengers it will also be the 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.939
 rise is a link to what is in these critters 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:21.349
 check in the antioxidants so keep dropping 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.009
 also articles 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:27.209
 he just has to give a little extra boost in advance, I think 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:30.389
 too far some people eat them all by themselves too 

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:33.699
 I know who is a fisherman against knowing that if you do, they are toppers 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:34.659
 wonderfully soft 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.469
 the city is going to do 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.360
 yes and what is that again 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.339
 that's normal 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.029
 that you put them in the low groundwater level 

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:45.029
 a detached until they are soft nothing surrendered 

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:50.989
 he did kokusai i'm gonna be i melt 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.649
 I put it in a pan 

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:56.639
 but I can already do that in a microwave 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:01.139
 in addition, just can not cut the microwave very much because you 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:06.370
 existing brands there bush I quickly are very quiet a package 

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:15.949
 we are going to protect ingredients that city i also saudi arabia 

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:19.749
 yes i was two days was three days 

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:23.319
 8 and heintje door to door 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.319
 hayek 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.549
 one and a half month later crashed 

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:32.419
 I think your best for a later date 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:34.579
 are now 8 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:37.439
 I find the water off 

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:38.729
 almost 3 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 we may then join 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:45.959
 and buy a Saudi has ended 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.329
 opportunities fell out 

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:49.699
 the church opens 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.699
 bring a good spoonful of cocoa powder 

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.619
 and thereby 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.619
 that means position 

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:03.479
 so there is a reason 

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:06.479
 Small print sometimes expects something easier 

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:14.079
 yes and those of other frisian inc i already suspect two hours on a sale 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:16.289
 that of being good but when we come out 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:20.829
 let us know there we are all seated fishing and were born here 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:22.569
 on the schwarzenegger 

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:24.919
 can get rid of you 

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.800
 Bah 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:30.800
 but the like 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.819
 besides the bowl full of healthy chocolates they are good for you 

00:04:36.819 --> 00:04:40.629
 resistance they are good for the slender line to be full of antioxidants so 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:43.629
 it goes against proportion they are good for your mood 

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:46.720
 I'm just saying I'm not feeling guilty
