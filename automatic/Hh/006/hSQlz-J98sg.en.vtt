00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
blankets have a rounded corner because I

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.620 
blankets have a rounded corner because I
just<00:02:11.500> think<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.770> adds<00:02:11.980> a<00:02:12.220> little<00:02:12.459> added<00:02:13.000> touch

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630
