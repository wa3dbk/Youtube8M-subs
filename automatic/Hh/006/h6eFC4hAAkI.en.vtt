00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
she is gonna have a big weight loss but

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.630 
she is gonna have a big weight loss but
the<00:01:28.170> skinny<00:01:28.439> amount<00:01:28.829> that<00:01:28.950> you<00:01:29.040> see<00:01:29.250> him<00:01:29.430> now

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the skinny amount that you see him now

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.490 
the skinny amount that you see him now
it's<00:01:29.880> not<00:01:30.119> gonna<00:01:30.299> be<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.479> skinny<00:01:31.079> unless<00:01:31.380> he

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
it's not gonna be that skinny unless he

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.200 
it's not gonna be that skinny unless he
even<00:01:31.770> continues<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.369> lose<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.820> weight<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
even continues to lose more weight and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.240 
even continues to lose more weight and
he<00:01:33.840> goes<00:01:34.020> back<00:01:34.259> up<00:01:34.290> to<00:01:34.470> this<00:01:34.710> type<00:01:34.979> of<00:01:35.009> weight

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
he goes back up to this type of weight

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.980 
he goes back up to this type of weight
but<00:01:35.280> don't<00:01:35.729> worry<00:01:35.909> since<00:01:36.390> he's<00:01:36.540> on<00:01:36.689> a<00:01:36.720> low-carb

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
but don't worry since he's on a low-carb

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.560 
but don't worry since he's on a low-carb
diet<00:01:37.380> he<00:01:38.189> definitely<00:01:38.430> is<00:01:38.880> losing<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.390> lot<00:01:39.509> of

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
diet he definitely is losing a lot of

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.929 
diet he definitely is losing a lot of
water<00:01:39.869> he's<00:01:40.409> on<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> low-carb<00:01:40.860> diet<00:01:41.220> which<00:01:41.700> also

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
water he's on a low-carb diet which also

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.880 
water he's on a low-carb diet which also
means<00:01:42.420> that<00:01:42.630> his<00:01:42.869> vascularity<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.740> lot

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
means that his vascularity it's a lot

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.560 
means that his vascularity it's a lot
more<00:01:43.920> increased<00:01:44.520> and<00:01:44.759> his<00:01:44.850> bulkiness<00:01:45.360> is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
more increased and his bulkiness is

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.080 
more increased and his bulkiness is
definitely<00:01:46.200> depleted<00:01:46.979> if<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.220> will<00:01:47.430> so<00:01:47.939> I<00:01:47.970> do

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
bit faster his metabolism metabolism is

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.980 
bit faster his metabolism metabolism is
definitely<00:01:59.640> gonna<00:01:59.729> raise<00:02:00.030> his<00:02:00.450> vascularity

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
definitely gonna raise his vascularity

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.600 
definitely gonna raise his vascularity
still<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.710> there<00:02:01.860> he's<00:02:02.070> gonna<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.369> a<00:02:02.399> lot

still gonna be there he's gonna be a lot

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.760 
still gonna be there he's gonna be a lot
more<00:02:02.640> defining<00:02:03.210> what<00:02:03.479> not<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:03.899> LeBron<00:02:04.380> James

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
more defining what not so LeBron James

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.109 
more defining what not so LeBron James
is<00:02:04.950> basically<00:02:05.399> he<00:02:05.490> knows<00:02:05.640> what<00:02:05.820> he's<00:02:05.909> doing

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
is basically he knows what he's doing

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.999 
is basically he knows what he's doing
and<00:02:06.240> tortoises<00:02:06.570> nutritionist<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.469> you<00:02:07.920> know

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
and tortoises nutritionist but you know

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.070 
and tortoises nutritionist but you know
by<00:02:08.129> the<00:02:08.190> time<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.580> season<00:02:08.789> starts<00:02:08.940> his<00:02:09.750> weight

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
by the time the season starts his weight

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.010 
by the time the season starts his weight
will<00:02:10.379> be<00:02:10.560> decreased<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.489> that<00:02:12.239> is<00:02:12.480> honestly

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
will be decreased and that is honestly

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.520 
will be decreased and that is honestly
insane

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
insane

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.990 
insane
the<00:02:13.709> obvious<00:02:14.130> goal<00:02:14.370> that<00:02:14.550> they're<00:02:14.700> trying<00:02:14.940> to

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
the obvious goal that they're trying to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.020 
the obvious goal that they're trying to
do<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:16.050> make<00:02:16.110> him<00:02:16.590> lose<00:02:16.770> some<00:02:17.040> weight<00:02:17.069> so<00:02:17.880> he

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
do is make him lose some weight so he

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.570 
do is make him lose some weight so he
can<00:02:18.360> be<00:02:18.569> faster<00:02:19.140> he<00:02:19.440> can<00:02:19.620> still<00:02:19.860> have<00:02:20.100> you<00:02:20.550> know

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
can be faster he can still have you know

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
can be faster he can still have you know
all<00:02:20.670> that<00:02:21.000> strength<00:02:21.360> that<00:02:21.569> he<00:02:21.630> possesses<00:02:22.170> he

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
all that strength that he possesses he

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.110 
all that strength that he possesses he
could<00:02:22.890> still<00:02:22.980> be<00:02:23.130> more<00:02:23.400> he'll<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.730> more<00:02:23.910> agile

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
could still be more he'll be more agile

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.000 
could still be more he'll be more agile
and<00:02:24.660> he'll<00:02:25.080> just<00:02:25.110> honestly<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.770> a<00:02:25.800> better

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
and he'll just honestly be a better

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.350 
and he'll just honestly be a better
basketball<00:02:26.190> player<00:02:26.520> and<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:26.970> think<00:02:27.209> it's<00:02:27.300> a

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
basketball player and I think it's a

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.470 
basketball player and I think it's a
smartest<00:02:27.840> move<00:02:28.050> ever<00:02:28.319> by<00:02:29.040> LeBron<00:02:29.700> James<00:02:30.090> to<00:02:30.300> do

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
smartest move ever by LeBron James to do

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.150 
smartest move ever by LeBron James to do
something<00:02:30.840> like<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.260> he<00:02:31.500> is<00:02:31.530> gonna<00:02:31.800> be<00:02:31.950> way

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
something like this he is gonna be way

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280 
something like this he is gonna be way
better<00:02:32.370> defensively<00:02:33.030> he<00:02:33.480> already<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.870> he's

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
better defensively he already is he's

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.559 
better defensively he already is he's
could<00:02:34.470> even<00:02:34.860> better<00:02:35.130> look<00:02:35.580> LeBron<00:02:36.030> James<00:02:36.060> is

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
could even better look LeBron James is

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.850 
could even better look LeBron James is
chasing<00:02:37.050> that<00:02:37.140> defensive<00:02:37.590> player<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.800> the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
chasing that defensive player of the

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.260 
chasing that defensive player of the
year<00:02:38.069> that's<00:02:38.190> something<00:02:38.550> he<00:02:38.670> wants<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.060> most

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
year that's something he wants the most

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.960 
year that's something he wants the most
and<00:02:39.600> honestly<00:02:40.260> believe<00:02:40.560> if<00:02:40.590> this<00:02:41.280> works<00:02:41.819> out

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
and honestly believe if this works out

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.820 
and honestly believe if this works out
for<00:02:42.209> him<00:02:42.300> what<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.569> probably<00:02:42.750> will<00:02:43.170> he's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
for him what you probably will he's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.260 
for him what you probably will he's
