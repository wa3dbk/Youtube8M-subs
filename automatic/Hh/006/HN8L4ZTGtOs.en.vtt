engine will not start or barely start at
that<00:01:09.780> point<00:01:10.110> it's<00:01:10.380> long<00:01:10.860> block<00:01:11.220> timing<00:01:11.640> these

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
that point it's long block timing these

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.090 
that point it's long block timing these
engines<00:01:12.299> these<00:01:12.479> 6.7<00:01:13.260> liter<00:01:13.290> engines<00:01:13.890> are

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
engines these 6.7 liter engines are

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.010 
engines these 6.7 liter engines are
absolutely<00:01:14.939> horrendous<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.720> comes<00:01:15.900> to

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
absolutely horrendous when it comes to

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.670 
absolutely horrendous when it comes to
price<00:01:16.229> they're<00:01:16.470> upwards<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:17.900> $15,000<00:01:18.900> and

price they're upwards of $15,000 and

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.200 
price they're upwards of $15,000 and
you'd<00:01:19.830> be<00:01:19.950> even<00:01:20.070> higher<00:01:20.369> than<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.790> by<00:01:20.970> time

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
you'd be even higher than that by time

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.160 
you'd be even higher than that by time
you<00:01:21.299> get<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.540> thing<00:01:21.720> out<00:01:21.810> of<00:01:21.960> there<00:01:22.080> because

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
you get the thing out of there because

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.800 
you get the thing out of there because
