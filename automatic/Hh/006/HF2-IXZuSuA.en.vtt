00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.130 
again soon I fall those two so it adds
an<00:01:46.799> extra<00:01:46.920> five<00:01:47.340> bucks<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.939> contact<00:01:48.509> along<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
an extra five bucks of contact along the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.510 
an extra five bucks of contact along the
side<00:01:49.350> wall<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.680> addition<00:01:50.040> to<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.189> two<00:01:50.399> we

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
side wall in addition to the two we

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.460 
side wall in addition to the two we
already<00:01:50.790> have<00:01:51.110> especially<00:01:52.110> the<00:01:52.229> three

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
already have especially the three

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.170 
already have especially the three
between<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:52.950> feet<00:01:53.189> they<00:01:53.729> actually<00:01:53.909> allow

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
between the feet they actually allow

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.270 
between the feet they actually allow
those<00:01:54.540> extended<00:01:54.960> mops<00:01:55.259> add<00:01:55.560> pressure<00:01:55.979> between

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
those extended mops add pressure between

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.490 
those extended mops add pressure between
the<00:01:56.520> feet<00:01:56.729> so<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.030> allows<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.450> board<00:01:57.659> to<00:01:57.719> have

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
the feet so it allows the board to have

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.440 
the feet so it allows the board to have
grab<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.920> ICS<00:01:59.400> conditions<00:01:59.910> this<00:02:00.090> portal

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
grab the ICS conditions this portal

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.080 
grab the ICS conditions this portal
