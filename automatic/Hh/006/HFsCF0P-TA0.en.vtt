could<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.759> maybe<00:01:33.270> explain<00:01:33.360> why<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.869> think<00:01:34.170> it

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
could you maybe explain why you think it

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.929 
could you maybe explain why you think it
is<00:01:34.380> that<00:01:34.409> most<00:01:34.799> stores<00:01:35.310> don't<00:01:35.880> do<00:01:36.150> this<00:01:36.920> well<00:01:37.939> I

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
is that most stores don't do this well I

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.810 
is that most stores don't do this well I
probably<00:01:39.479> can't<00:01:39.960> explain<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.950> still

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
probably can't explain that and still

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.910 
probably can't explain that and still
have<00:01:42.210> those<00:01:43.200> bike<00:01:43.500> retailers<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.490> me<00:01:45.890> but<00:01:46.890> I
