 the ball 

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.420

 Carlos Ruiz in the photo Maria is going to be 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.250
 study from the start to minute 93 did not stop 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.900
 to run luis carlos ruiz awhile 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.290
 we made mention of precisely that 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:55.300
 player who was always in the 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:56.909
 continuous movement being support for 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.009
 his companions 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.020
 latent danger in a backlash like 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.539
 in this to take the step forward 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.670
 and define and here comes the prize and 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.590
 on the last play of the game to Luis

 Carlos Ruiz that the long strip has 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.930
 still bottom like to get to that 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:15.930
 ball and define well despite all the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:18.030
 effort he made to touch the ball a 2 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.250
 to 0 from a team that had less 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.870
 ball in possession surely the 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:25.040
 numbers are going to say that today in the 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.040
 I find that he had the ball less
