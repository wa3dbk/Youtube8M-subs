00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
what I did here was rather than mount

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.410 
what I did here was rather than mount
that<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.260> the<00:03:09.290> tanks<00:03:09.829> as<00:03:10.090> it<00:03:11.090> is

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:11.420 
that the the the tanks as it is

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.180 
that the the the tanks as it is
suggested<00:03:12.350> in<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.680> manual<00:03:13.190> I<00:03:13.430> routed<00:03:14.890> yeah<00:03:15.890> I

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
suggested in the manual I routed yeah I

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.370 
suggested in the manual I routed yeah I
wrote<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.850> down<00:03:17.120> so<00:03:17.450> that<00:03:17.480> I<00:03:17.660> did<00:03:17.900> not<00:03:18.019> have<00:03:18.200> any

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
wrote it down so that I did not have any

please<00:04:40.590> excuse<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.460> wire<00:04:42.260> temporary<00:04:43.260> support

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:43.830 
please excuse the wire temporary support

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.360 
please excuse the wire temporary support
for<00:04:44.669> the<00:04:44.990> plumbing<00:04:45.990> because<00:04:47.120> these<00:04:48.120> fittings

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
for the plumbing because these fittings

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.430 
for the plumbing because these fittings
allow<00:04:50.370> for<00:04:51.050> rotation<00:04:52.050> of<00:04:52.310> the<00:04:53.310> pipe<00:04:53.580> and<00:04:54.440> until

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:55.440 
allow for rotation of the pipe and until

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:58.820 
allow for rotation of the pipe and until
I<00:04:55.470> can<00:04:57.110> put<00:04:58.110> together<00:04:58.229> some<00:04:58.590> type<00:04:58.800> of

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
I can put together some type of

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:03.950 
I can put together some type of
permanent<00:05:01.010> support<00:05:02.010> for<00:05:02.280> these<00:05:02.400> pipes<00:05:02.960> they

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
permanent support for these pipes they

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.170 
permanent support for these pipes they
will<00:05:04.200> rotate<00:05:04.440> down<00:05:04.889> and<00:05:05.250> fall<00:05:05.880> out<00:05:06.060> of

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
will rotate down and fall out of

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.540 
will rotate down and fall out of
alignment<00:05:06.419> so<00:05:06.930> I<00:05:06.960> do<00:05:07.139> have<00:05:07.380> them<00:05:07.620> temporarily

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
alignment so I do have them temporarily

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.730 
alignment so I do have them temporarily
supported<00:05:09.210> I<00:05:09.300> can<00:05:09.479> do<00:05:09.600> until<00:05:09.990> I<00:05:10.020> can<00:05:10.260> do<00:05:10.350> that

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
supported I can do until I can do that

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:17.240 
supported I can do until I can do that
so<00:05:11.840> that<00:05:12.840> is<00:05:13.520> the<00:05:14.520> over<00:05:15.210> overview<00:05:16.169> of<00:05:16.650> this
