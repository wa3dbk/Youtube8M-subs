00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.100 

okay<00:00:01.290> I'm<00:00:01.560> going<00:00:01.709> to<00:00:01.770> show<00:00:01.860> you<00:00:02.010> how<00:00:02.129> to<00:00:02.190> build

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:03.110 
okay I'm going to show you how to build

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.100 
okay I'm going to show you how to build
really<00:00:04.110> really<00:00:04.350> compact<00:00:04.940> modular<00:00:05.940> inverse

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.110 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.370 

for<00:00:10.110> note<00:00:10.500> boxes<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.130> other<00:00:11.219> purposes<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.380> lot

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
for note boxes and other purposes a lot

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.200 
for note boxes and other purposes a lot
of<00:00:13.469> people<00:00:13.740> do<00:00:13.889> like<00:00:13.920> cannons<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.759> stuff<00:00:15.000> and

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
of people do like cannons and stuff and

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.910 
of people do like cannons and stuff and
you<00:00:15.330> need<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.540> lot<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> inverters<00:00:16.379> for<00:00:16.410> delay

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
you need a lot of inverters for delay

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.019 
you need a lot of inverters for delay
for<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:19.010> this<00:00:20.010> will<00:00:20.310> likewise<00:00:20.820> work

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
for that and this will likewise work

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.550 
for that and this will likewise work
with<00:00:21.270> this<00:00:21.420> first<00:00:21.810> you<00:00:21.960> need<00:00:22.109> start<00:00:22.350> out<00:00:22.439> with

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
with this first you need start out with

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.890 
with this first you need start out with
a<00:00:22.619> three<00:00:22.920> like<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.609> then<00:00:24.269> you<00:00:24.420> expand

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
a three like this and then you expand

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.470 
a three like this and then you expand
one<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.230> over<00:00:25.410> here<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:25.970> it's<00:00:26.970> always<00:00:27.240> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
one out over here and it's always the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.830 
one out over here and it's always the
second<00:00:27.810> level<00:00:27.960> that<00:00:28.170> expands<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.840> you'll

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
second level that expands and so you'll

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.590 
second level that expands and so you'll
know<00:00:30.990> these<00:00:31.380> three<00:00:31.949> your<00:00:32.130> inverters<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:33.350> then

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
know these three your inverters and then

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.299 
know these three your inverters and then
you<00:00:36.600> go<00:00:36.750> here<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.170> then<00:00:37.410> route<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> we<00:00:38.010> put<00:00:38.160> it

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
you go here and then route and we put it

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.580 
you go here and then route and we put it
on<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.579> side<00:00:38.850> so<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.750> chains<00:00:40.230> into

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
on this side so that this chains into

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:50.040 
on this side so that this chains into
our<00:00:40.680> next<00:00:40.920> inverter<00:00:41.540> so<00:00:42.540> we<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.780> over<00:00:42.809> here<00:00:43.100> and

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.200 

you<00:00:50.560> put<00:00:50.770> another<00:00:50.980> and<00:00:51.220> worker<00:00:51.520> set<00:00:51.730> and<00:00:51.970> then

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
you put another and worker set and then

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.020 
you put another and worker set and then
the<00:00:52.360> long<00:00:52.570> one<00:00:52.780> over<00:00:52.960> here

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.959 

and<00:00:58.120> then<00:00:58.809> here<00:00:59.260> to<00:00:59.770> change<00:01:00.039> into<00:01:00.430> this<00:01:00.579> one<00:01:00.850> we

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
and then here to change into this one we

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.090 
and then here to change into this one we
have<00:01:01.090> to<00:01:01.180> go<00:01:01.300> into<00:01:01.449> this<00:01:01.660> rock<00:01:01.960> that's<00:01:02.710> not

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
have to go into this rock that's not

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.100 
have to go into this rock that's not
actually<00:01:03.489> enough<00:01:04.000> you<00:01:04.239> have<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.420> do<00:01:04.629> two<00:01:04.839> there

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
actually enough you have to do two there

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.940 
actually enough you have to do two there
to<00:01:05.530> keep<00:01:05.680> it<00:01:05.860> straight<00:01:06.159> so<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:07.659> go<00:01:07.780> here<00:01:08.049> it'll

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
to keep it straight so we go here it'll

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.210 
to keep it straight so we go here it'll
go<00:01:09.100> straight<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.580> then<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:13.030> same<00:01:13.270> here<00:01:14.220> mmm

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
go straight and then the same here mmm

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.300 
go straight and then the same here mmm
this<00:01:15.640> one<00:01:15.820> goes<00:01:15.970> here<00:01:16.050> and<00:01:17.050> then<00:01:17.200> so<00:01:17.950> we<00:01:18.100> just

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:18.310 
this one goes here and then so we just

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:24.850 
this one goes here and then so we just
go<00:01:18.970> there<00:01:19.149> go<00:01:19.390> there<00:01:19.600> go<00:01:19.630> there

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.270 

and<00:01:25.310> then<00:01:25.490> to<00:01:25.670> there

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
and then to there

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.370 
and then to there
okay<00:01:27.940> and

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.779 

span<00:01:31.380> here<00:01:32.689> right<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:34.399> you<00:01:35.399> want<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.609> bit<00:01:35.759> of

00:01:35.779 --> 00:01:35.789 
span here right there you want a bit of

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:38.899 
span here right there you want a bit of
redstone<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.420> top<00:01:36.770> and<00:01:37.770> then<00:01:37.890> to<00:01:38.039> our<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.789> you

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
redstone on top and then to our and you

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.099 
redstone on top and then to our and you
can<00:01:39.030> just<00:01:39.179> keep<00:01:39.299> doing<00:01:39.359> that<00:01:39.600> over<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.899> over

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:40.109 
can just keep doing that over and over

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:43.190 
can just keep doing that over and over
again<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.469> mean<00:01:40.920> there's<00:01:41.159> no<00:01:41.659> actual<00:01:42.659> let<00:01:43.079> me

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
again I mean there's no actual let me

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.660 
again I mean there's no actual let me
just<00:01:43.530> keep<00:01:43.679> going<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.159> way<00:01:44.280> over<00:01:44.429> there

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
just keep going all the way over there

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.090 
just keep going all the way over there
and<00:01:45.289> they<00:01:46.289> change<00:01:46.709> very<00:01:47.159> very<00:01:47.340> modular<00:01:47.579> Li<00:01:48.090> and

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
and they change very very modular Li and

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.859 
and they change very very modular Li and
to<00:01:50.100> start<00:01:50.399> it<00:01:50.579> you<00:01:50.670> need<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.060> power<00:01:51.240> this<00:01:51.569> first

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
to start it you need to power this first

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:59.380 
to start it you need to power this first
block<00:01:52.170> here<00:01:53.030> to<00:01:54.030> kick<00:01:54.270> off<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.539> inverter

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.140 

so<00:01:59.960> it<00:02:00.080> delays<00:02:00.440> plays<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.100> note<00:02:01.250> delays<00:02:01.820> plays

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:02.150 
so it delays plays and note delays plays

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.530 
so it delays plays and note delays plays
a<00:02:02.180> note<00:02:02.420> delays<00:02:02.990> plays<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.350> note

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.370 

and<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.230> just<00:02:07.440> keep<00:02:07.560> going

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
and you just keep going

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
and you just keep going
okay<00:02:10.010> this<00:02:10.190> is<00:02:10.370> like<00:02:10.670> ten<00:02:11.660> minutes<00:02:11.810> later<00:02:11.960> I

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
okay this is like ten minutes later I

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.160 
okay this is like ten minutes later I
completed<00:02:13.400> out<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.760> pattern<00:02:14.150> remember<00:02:15.020> it's

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
completed out the pattern remember it's

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.700 
completed out the pattern remember it's
you<00:02:16.130> do<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.490> zigzags<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.840> out<00:02:18.020> on<00:02:18.170> here<00:02:18.560> and

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:18.710 
you do the zigzags one out on here and

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.800 
you do the zigzags one out on here and
then<00:02:19.100> underneath<00:02:19.430> it<00:02:19.730> two<00:02:20.060> more<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.660> you're

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
then underneath it two more so you're

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.890 
then underneath it two more so you're
gonna<00:02:20.930> need<00:02:21.790> four<00:02:22.790> torches<00:02:23.090> for<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.660> four

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
gonna need four torches for the four

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.180 
gonna need four torches for the four
inverters<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.590> then<00:02:25.370> three<00:02:25.760> bits<00:02:26.030> of<00:02:26.300> a

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
inverters and then three bits of a

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.830 
inverters and then three bits of a
redstone<00:02:28.190> which<00:02:28.490> lead<00:02:28.760> out<00:02:28.910> to<00:02:28.940> different

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
redstone which lead out to different

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.340 
redstone which lead out to different
things<00:02:30.050> and<00:02:30.320> each<00:02:30.530> thing<00:02:31.490> like<00:02:32.270> this<00:02:32.480> row<00:02:32.810> does

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
things and each thing like this row does

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:37.390 
things and each thing like this row does
a<00:02:33.680> four<00:02:34.220> invert<00:02:34.610> +<00:02:34.910> 4<00:02:35.180> +<00:02:35.570> 4<00:02:35.840> +<00:02:36.320> 4<00:02:36.590> and<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.310> you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
a four invert + 4 + 4 + 4 and so you

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.940 
a four invert + 4 + 4 + 4 and so you
time<00:02:37.700> things<00:02:37.970> out<00:02:38.090> like<00:02:38.270> that<00:02:38.480> so<00:02:38.780> here<00:02:39.110> we<00:02:39.200> go
