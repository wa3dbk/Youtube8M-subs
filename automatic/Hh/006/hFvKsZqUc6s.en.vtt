know you can these old diesels were

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.800 
know you can these old diesels were
actually<00:01:17.010> made<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.340> accommodate<00:01:17.640> all<00:01:18.300> sorts

diesel itself and can actually run
pretty<00:01:22.409> well<00:01:22.500> on<00:01:22.830> them<00:01:23.210> but<00:01:24.210> here's<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.540> thing

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pretty well on them but here's the thing

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
well the answer is this vegetable oil

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
well the answer is this vegetable oil
even<00:01:37.560> though<00:01:37.680> it's<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:37.979> know<00:01:38.100> supposed<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.520> be

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
even though it's you know supposed to be

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.440 
even though it's you know supposed to be
healthy<00:01:38.940> for<00:01:38.970> you

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
I found out my research researching it

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.020 
I found out my research researching it
to<00:01:42.180> death<00:01:42.360> like<00:01:42.600> I<00:01:42.720> always<00:01:42.990> tend<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> do

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
to death like I always tend to do

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.609 
to death like I always tend to do
vegetable<00:01:45.030> oil<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.420> not<00:01:45.630> particularly<00:01:46.170> good

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
vegetable oil is not particularly good

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.600 
vegetable oil is not particularly good
for<00:01:46.830> you

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
and what I want to talk about today

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.700 
and what I want to talk about today
specifically<00:01:49.980> is<00:01:50.310> canola<00:01:51.150> oil<00:01:51.510> which<00:01:52.350> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
specifically is canola oil which I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.310 
specifically is canola oil which I
learned<00:01:53.400> is<00:01:53.700> actually<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.660> bit<00:01:54.840> of<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.050> shame

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
learned is actually a bit of a shame

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.220 
learned is actually a bit of a shame
canola<00:01:55.890> oil<00:01:56.190> isn't<00:01:57.060> even<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.360> real<00:01:57.570> word<00:01:57.990> in

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
canola oil isn't even a real word in

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.540 
canola oil isn't even a real word in
fact<00:01:59.420> canola<00:02:00.420> comes<00:02:00.840> from<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:02.070> canadian

fact canola comes from the canadian
rapeseed<00:02:03.060> plant<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.870> you<00:02:04.500> can<00:02:04.760> probably<00:02:05.760> see

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
rapeseed plant and you can probably see

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.890 
rapeseed plant and you can probably see
that<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:08.040> word<00:02:08.220> rapeseed<00:02:08.850> wouldn't<00:02:09.330> make<00:02:09.690> for

that the word rapeseed wouldn't make for
