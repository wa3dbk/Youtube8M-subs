what it is is that I kind of thought

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.840 
what it is is that I kind of thought
that<00:00:58.680> something<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.160> be<00:00:59.309> wrong<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.550> I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
the way the human body works the jaw

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.170 
the way the human body works the jaw
here<00:01:09.780> connects<00:01:10.680> all<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.280> way<00:01:11.400> up<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.850> ear

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
here connects all the way up to the ear

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
here connects all the way up to the ear
and<00:01:12.360> there's<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.689> nerve<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> runs<00:01:13.229> down<00:01:13.710> and

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
and there's a nerve that runs down and

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.100 
and there's a nerve that runs down and
what<00:01:14.939> happens<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> when<00:01:15.630> we're<00:01:15.810> sick<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
what happens to that when we're sick of

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
what happens to that when we're sick of
course<00:01:16.500> our<00:01:16.650> sinuses<00:01:17.009> are<00:01:17.250> usually<00:01:17.610> congested

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
course our sinuses are usually congested

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.499 
course our sinuses are usually congested
we<00:01:18.450> have<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:18.750> drain<00:01:19.110> nose<00:01:19.470> back<00:01:20.189> down<00:01:20.700> into<00:01:21.150> our

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
we have to drain nose back down into our

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.870 
we have to drain nose back down into our
throats<00:01:21.930> that's<00:01:22.680> why<00:01:22.890> sometimes<00:01:23.220> we<00:01:23.580> get<00:01:23.700> that

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
throats that's why sometimes we get that

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.950 
throats that's why sometimes we get that
that<00:01:24.750> nasty<00:01:24.930> stuff<00:01:25.580> that's<00:01:26.580> our<00:01:26.729> snot<00:01:27.060> going

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
that nasty stuff that's our snot going

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.390 
that nasty stuff that's our snot going
down<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.409> our<00:01:28.680> nose<00:01:28.920> that's<00:01:29.130> why<00:01:29.250> we

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
down the back of our nose that's why we

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.010 
down the back of our nose that's why we
can<00:01:29.549> breathe<00:01:29.729> through<00:01:29.790> our<00:01:30.060> nose<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.780> long's

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
can breathe through our nose how long's

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.100 
can breathe through our nose how long's
your<00:01:31.140> down<00:01:31.320> here<00:01:31.680> we<00:01:32.159> should<00:01:32.340> go<00:01:32.479> and<00:01:33.479> breathe

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
your down here we should go and breathe

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.140 
your down here we should go and breathe
through<00:01:34.320> our<00:01:34.439> lungs<00:01:34.670> but<00:01:35.670> instead<00:01:36.180> we<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.570> go

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
through our lungs but instead we can go

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.039 
through our lungs but instead we can go
theoretically<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.360> should<00:01:39.390> go<00:01:39.689> through<00:01:39.930> your

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
theoretically you should go through your

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.510 
theoretically you should go through your
nose<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.530> goes<00:01:40.650> into<00:01:40.829> your<00:01:41.009> lungs<00:01:41.130> recent

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
nose and it goes into your lungs recent

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.039 
nose and it goes into your lungs recent
wise<00:01:41.610> because<00:01:41.820> that's<00:01:41.970> connected<00:01:42.540> so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
wise because that's connected so

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.780 
wise because that's connected so
sometimes<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.619> snot<00:01:43.920> dreams<00:01:44.250> down<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:44.520> back

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
sometimes the snot dreams down the back

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:45.920 
sometimes the snot dreams down the back
of<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:44.939> nose<00:01:45.090> gets<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.479> throne<00:01:45.750> it's

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
of the nose gets in the throne it's

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.330 
of the nose gets in the throne it's
gross<00:01:46.920> right<00:01:48.409> um<00:01:49.409> well<00:01:49.860> what<00:01:50.009> happens

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
gross right um well what happens

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.179 
gross right um well what happens
sometimes<00:01:51.030> that's<00:01:51.149> not<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:51.960> unable<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.560> drink

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
sometimes that's not is unable to drink

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.580 
sometimes that's not is unable to drink
now<00:01:53.369> our<00:01:53.549> ears<00:01:53.820> go<00:01:54.119> way<00:01:54.420> deep<00:01:54.869> into<00:01:55.079> our<00:01:55.259> head

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
now our ears go way deep into our head

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.530 
now our ears go way deep into our head
very<00:01:56.189> very<00:01:56.460> small<00:01:56.729> tubes<00:01:57.030> things<00:01:57.270> like<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
very very small tubes things like that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.999 
very very small tubes things like that
sometimes<00:01:58.049> what<00:01:58.200> happens<00:01:58.229> is<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.680> there's

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
sometimes what happens is that there's

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.160 
sometimes what happens is that there's
fluid<00:01:59.430> to<00:01:59.790> build<00:01:59.820> up<00:02:00.210> in<00:02:00.420> those<00:02:00.540> years<00:02:00.810> and

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
fluid to build up in those years and

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.289 
fluid to build up in those years and
your<00:02:01.979> infections<00:02:02.490> are<00:02:02.579> usually<00:02:02.850> worse<00:02:03.030> when

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
your infections are usually worse when

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.850 
your infections are usually worse when
you<00:02:03.390> lay<00:02:03.570> down<00:02:03.600> than<00:02:04.049> when<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.320> sit<00:02:04.530> up<00:02:04.649> and

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
you lay down than when you sit up and

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.429 
you lay down than when you sit up and
that's<00:02:05.460> why<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.149> fluid<00:02:06.780> gets<00:02:06.930> stuck

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
that's why because that fluid gets stuck

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:08.410 
that's why because that fluid gets stuck
in<00:02:07.619> those<00:02:07.770> little

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
in those little

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.520 
in those little
of<00:02:08.660> your<00:02:08.780> ears<00:02:09.050> and<00:02:09.289> your<00:02:10.220> ear<00:02:11.170> see<00:02:12.170> your<00:02:12.319> ears

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
of your ears and your ear see your ears

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.199 
of your ears and your ear see your ears
here<00:02:12.800> on<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.040> outside<00:02:13.340> of<00:02:13.430> your<00:02:13.520> head<00:02:13.700> the

00:02:14.199 --> 00:02:14.209 
here on the outside of your head the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:16.240 
here on the outside of your head the
tube<00:02:14.450> is<00:02:14.599> in<00:02:14.810> like<00:02:15.349> this<00:02:15.530> it's<00:02:15.739> at<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> downward

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
tube is in like this it's at a downward

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.979 
tube is in like this it's at a downward
angle<00:02:16.610> it's<00:02:16.940> not<00:02:17.120> up<00:02:17.300> like<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.660> because<00:02:17.810> it

00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
angle it's not up like this because it

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.510 
angle it's not up like this because it
was<00:02:18.140> up<00:02:18.290> like<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.860> just<00:02:18.920> have<00:02:19.190> fluid

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
was up like this we just have fluid

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:21.790 
was up like this we just have fluid
draining<00:02:19.849> out<00:02:20.000> but<00:02:20.510> it's<00:02:20.630> down<00:02:20.870> here<00:02:20.900> so<00:02:21.650> all

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
draining out but it's down here so all

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.559 
draining out but it's down here so all
that<00:02:21.980> fluid<00:02:22.280> stays<00:02:22.700> in<00:02:22.910> this<00:02:23.030> little<00:02:23.270> canal

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
that fluid stays in this little canal

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.840 
that fluid stays in this little canal
and<00:02:23.810> it<00:02:23.900> causes<00:02:24.080> a<00:02:24.260> lot<00:02:24.560> of<00:02:24.620> pain<00:02:25.069> and<00:02:25.340> it's

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
and it causes a lot of pain and it's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:27.550 
and it causes a lot of pain and it's
clogged<00:02:26.209> up<00:02:26.420> we<00:02:26.720> might<00:02:26.840> not<00:02:26.989> be<00:02:27.050> able<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.350> hear

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
clogged up we might not be able to hear

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.500 
clogged up we might not be able to hear
right<00:02:27.590> and<00:02:27.920> are<00:02:28.040> used<00:02:28.280> or<00:02:28.489> unpressurized<00:02:28.910> like

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
when you go on a plane I really high

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.270 
when you go on a plane I really high
altitudes<00:02:32.750> maybe<00:02:32.989> one<00:02:33.260> ear<00:02:33.470> pops<00:02:33.830> but<00:02:34.190> the

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
altitudes maybe one ear pops but the

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.460 
altitudes maybe one ear pops but the
other<00:02:34.400> doesn't<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.510> like<00:02:35.690> it<00:02:35.930> feels<00:02:36.319> like

it causes this pain into this jaw

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.130 
it causes this pain into this jaw
