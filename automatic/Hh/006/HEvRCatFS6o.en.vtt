these buttons in the wrong order there

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.869 
these buttons in the wrong order there
nothing<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.670> happens<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.370> apparently

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
nothing really happens and apparently

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:48.889 
nothing really happens and apparently
they<00:00:45.059> want<00:00:45.360> us<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.719> stay<00:00:46.940> now<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.480> one

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
they want us to stay now we get to one

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.510 
they want us to stay now we get to one
of<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.140> most<00:00:49.320> annoying<00:00:49.649> part<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.190> game

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
of the most annoying part of the game

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.560 
of the most annoying part of the game
and<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:52.230> shooting<00:00:52.920> section<00:00:53.570> where

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
and that is this shooting section where

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.080 
and that is this shooting section where
you<00:00:54.690> have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:54.989> shoot<00:00:55.260> down<00:00:55.289> these<00:00:55.649> miles<00:00:56.090> the

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
you have to shoot down these miles the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.779 
you have to shoot down these miles the
problem<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.260> kind<00:00:58.680> of<00:00:58.859> arts<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.430> hit

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
problem is that the kind of arts to hit

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.389 
problem is that the kind of arts to hit
you<00:01:00.090> have<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.300> shoot<00:01:00.989> them<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.289> bit<00:01:01.530> bit<00:01:02.190> in

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
you have to shoot them a bit bit in

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.429 
you have to shoot them a bit bit in
front<00:01:02.640> much<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.270> missile<00:01:03.750> command

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
front much like missile command

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.160 
front much like missile command
I<00:01:04.939> think<00:01:05.939> this<00:01:06.390> parting<00:01:07.170> of<00:01:07.350> the

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
I think this parting of the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.890 
I think this parting of the
well<00:01:08.740> executed<00:01:09.460> and<00:01:10.000> the<00:01:10.360> worst<00:01:10.600> thing<00:01:10.870> is

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
well executed and the worst thing is

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.420 
well executed and the worst thing is
that<00:01:11.229> there's<00:01:11.470> another<00:01:11.650> one<00:01:12.100> of<00:01:12.310> these

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
that there's another one of these

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:18.330 
that there's another one of these
sections<00:01:12.940> later<00:01:13.390> on<00:01:16.830> luckily<00:01:17.830> though<00:01:18.010> there

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:18.340 
sections later on luckily though there

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:24.890 
sections later on luckily though there
aren't<00:01:18.909> too<00:01:19.119> long<00:01:19.150> so<00:01:23.010> it's<00:01:24.010> not<00:01:24.250> too<00:01:24.490> bad<00:01:24.700> but

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
aren't too long so it's not too bad but

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.140 
aren't too long so it's not too bad but
one<00:01:25.900> one<00:01:26.320> mine<00:01:26.590> if<00:01:26.860> one<00:01:27.130> might<00:01:27.280> hit<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.820> you're

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
one one mine if one might hit you you're

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.499 
one one mine if one might hit you you're
dead<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:29.290> there<00:01:29.560> are<00:01:29.590> no<00:01:29.770> the<00:01:29.830> few

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
dead and there are no the few

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.670 
dead and there are no the few
checkpoints<00:01:31.509> in<00:01:31.600> this<00:01:31.720> game<00:01:31.990> if<00:01:32.170> you<00:01:32.290> forget

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:45.889 
there it is pretty badly which means

00:02:45.889 --> 00:02:50.330

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:10.140 
hard I mean just fiddling around most of

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:17.190 
hard I mean just fiddling around most of
them<00:06:10.290> can<00:06:10.500> be<00:06:10.530> solved<00:06:10.920> with<00:06:11.070> just<00:06:11.100> dead

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:17.200
