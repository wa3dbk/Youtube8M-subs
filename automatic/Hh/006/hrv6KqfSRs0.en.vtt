so public health informatics has become

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.189 
so public health informatics has become
a<00:00:18.810> really<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> key<00:00:20.099> part<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.869> effective<00:00:21.869> Public

dissemination of information so it

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.079 
dissemination of information so it
really<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.839> key<00:00:40.110> component<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:41.089> Public

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:42.089

Health practice today in the US however
it<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.150> not<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.360> new<00:00:45.690> concept<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.949> public<00:00:47.460> health

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
it is not a new concept to public health

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.479 
it is not a new concept to public health
that<00:00:48.150> is<00:00:48.390> the<00:00:48.660> use<00:00:48.899> of<00:00:49.140> information<00:00:49.489> or

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
that is the use of information or

that is the use of information or
information<00:00:51.000> science<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.690> I'll<00:00:52.469> give<00:00:52.620> you<00:00:52.710> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
information science so I'll give you a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.010 
information science so I'll give you a
little<00:00:52.890> historical<00:00:53.219> background<00:00:53.430> where<00:00:54.359> data

little historical background where data
and<00:00:55.350> information<00:00:56.280> was<00:00:56.489> really<00:00:56.699> used<00:00:56.879> for

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
and information was really used for

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.639 
and information was really used for
quite<00:00:57.210> effectively<00:00:57.750> in<00:00:57.840> public<00:00:58.140> health

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649

analyses<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.149> will<00:01:54.330> was<00:01:54.989> one<00:01:55.170> she<00:01:55.349> did<00:01:55.590> for

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
analyses if you will was one she did for

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.740 
analyses if you will was one she did for
the<00:01:55.950> British<00:01:56.250> military<00:01:56.700> in<00:01:57.209> the<00:01:57.300> Crimean<00:01:57.720> War

the British military in the Crimean War

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.460 
the British military in the Crimean War
and<00:01:58.560> she<00:01:59.399> clearly<00:01:59.789> demonstrated<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.660> most

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
and she clearly demonstrated that most

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.130 
and she clearly demonstrated that most
of<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.190> troops<00:02:02.399> were<00:02:02.640> dying<00:02:02.879> from<00:02:03.090> disease<00:02:03.539> as

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
of the troops were dying from disease as

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.949 
of the troops were dying from disease as
opposed<00:02:04.500> to<00:02:04.590> bullets<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.280> her<00:02:06.209> polar<00:02:06.509> area

00:02:06.949 --> 00:02:06.959 
opposed to bullets and her polar area

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:11.360 
opposed to bullets and her polar area
chart<00:02:07.289> was<00:02:07.709> a<00:02:08.069> very<00:02:08.879> effective<00:02:10.370> communication

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
chart was a very effective communication

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.400 
chart was a very effective communication
tool<00:02:11.580> this<00:02:12.270> was<00:02:12.420> sort<00:02:12.599> of<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:12.750> predecessor<00:02:13.379> of

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
tool this was sort of the predecessor of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.140 
tool this was sort of the predecessor of
the<00:02:13.680> pie<00:02:13.860> chart<00:02:13.890> that<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.550> commonly<00:02:15.030> used

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
the pie chart that is commonly used

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.760 
the pie chart that is commonly used
today

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
today

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.680 
today
so<00:02:16.770> really<00:02:16.950> informatics<00:02:17.790> is<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.120> heart<00:02:18.450> of

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
so really informatics is the heart of

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.199 
so really informatics is the heart of
many<00:02:18.930> critical<00:02:19.370> processes<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.700> public<00:02:21.030> health

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
many critical processes in public health

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.500 
many critical processes in public health
that<00:02:22.020> start<00:02:22.470> with<00:02:22.590> data<00:02:22.770> collection<00:02:23.329> moved<00:02:24.329> to

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
that start with data collection moved to

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.929 
that start with data collection moved to
data<00:02:24.719> analysis<00:02:25.349> as<00:02:25.739> well<00:02:26.010> as<00:02:26.189> cleaning<00:02:26.700> of<00:02:26.819> the

data analysis as well as cleaning of the

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:28.000 
data analysis as well as cleaning of the
data<00:02:27.180> and

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
corrected data back to the source system

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.410 
corrected data back to the source system
and<00:02:30.349> then<00:02:30.890> using<00:02:31.250> that<00:02:31.280> corrected<00:02:31.970> data<00:02:32.120> to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
and then using that corrected data to

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.250

provide it to stakeholders that might

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.140 
provide it to stakeholders that might

data<00:02:42.950> develop<00:02:43.909> interventions<00:02:44.599> and<00:02:45.290> then

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
data develop interventions and then

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.140

evaluate<00:02:45.980> these<00:02:46.129> interventions<00:02:46.790> again

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
evaluate these interventions again

through a process of data collection and

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:51.309 
through a process of data collection and

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
requires one to have data you must

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.020 
requires one to have data you must
understand<00:03:06.230> what<00:03:06.560> the<00:03:06.680> process<00:03:07.129> is<00:03:07.340> before

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
understand what the process is before

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.449 
understand what the process is before
you<00:03:08.239> can<00:03:08.450> determine<00:03:09.409> what<00:03:09.920> the<00:03:10.040> process

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:10.459 
you can determine what the process

Esserman<00:03:14.659> from<00:03:14.989> UCSF<00:03:16.000> frequently<00:03:17.000> states<00:03:17.329> it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
Esserman from UCSF frequently states it

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:19.660 
Esserman from UCSF frequently states it
is<00:03:18.349> hard<00:03:18.590> to<00:03:18.709> improve<00:03:18.950> something<00:03:19.370> if<00:03:19.519> you're

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
is hard to improve something if you're

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.589 
is hard to improve something if you're
not<00:03:19.819> measuring<00:03:20.060> it

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
not measuring it

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.680 
not measuring it
so<00:03:20.870> really<00:03:21.099> improving<00:03:22.099> requires<00:03:23.030> measurement

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
so really improving requires measurement

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.430 
so really improving requires measurement
and<00:03:24.019> measurement<00:03:24.590> means<00:03:24.889> data<00:03:26.230> so<00:03:27.230> what<00:03:27.379> are

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
and measurement means data so what are

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.990 
and measurement means data so what are
the<00:03:27.530> core<00:03:27.709> competencies<00:03:28.400> in<00:03:28.430> public<00:03:28.819> health

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
technology to that improvement so in

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.620 
technology to that improvement so in
that<00:04:22.130> document<00:04:22.880> there<00:04:23.300> were<00:04:23.389> several

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
that document there were several

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.570 
that document there were several
competencies<00:04:24.530> laid<00:04:24.830> out<00:04:24.979> for<00:04:25.220> individuals

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:25.580 
competencies laid out for individuals

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.170 
competencies laid out for individuals
who<00:04:26.210> practice<00:04:26.810> public<00:04:27.440> health<00:04:27.620> informatics

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
who practice public health informatics

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.879 
who practice public health informatics
they<00:04:29.180> were<00:04:29.240> really<00:04:29.539> in<00:04:29.720> two<00:04:29.960> major<00:04:30.199> categories

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:30.889 
they were really in two major categories

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:33.339 
they were really in two major categories
one<00:04:31.760> was<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.210> public<00:04:32.479> health<00:04:32.659> category<00:04:33.169> the

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:33.349 
one was the public health category the

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:35.500 
one was the public health category the
other<00:04:33.500> of<00:04:33.650> the<00:04:33.740> informatics<00:04:34.099> category<00:04:34.820> so

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:35.510 
other of the informatics category so

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.360 
other of the informatics category so
under<00:04:35.750> public<00:04:36.080> health<00:04:36.320> really<00:04:37.250> the

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:37.370 
under public health really the

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:39.279 
under public health really the
individual<00:04:37.909> needs<00:04:38.300> to<00:04:38.450> have<00:04:38.750> a<00:04:38.780> solid

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:39.289 
individual needs to have a solid

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:41.200
