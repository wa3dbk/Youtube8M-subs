00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:04.510
 hello avatar fans that's for my vocation of meters in video of the 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.510
 Taibilla and carchi toy 

00:00:08.289 --> 00:00:12.209
 marcela removed the line of toys for the movie avatar 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:15.519
 if you want for those who stayed after an absence for several 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:16.829
 years 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.829
 a year after watching the movie 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:24.460
 fascinated 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.439
 the movie 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.829
 in sitges 

00:00:27.829 --> 00:00:31.019
 the truth is one of the best I've seen in 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.730
 many years 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.890
 this 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.060
 mate has the line and as I said 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.820
 this mayor, in fact, the line is very good 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.250
 although here in Mexico it is a bit difficult to get the figures 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.610
 since only 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.610
 stocks and liverpool 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.910
 parentheses are not intended to violate copyright 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:59.750
 well, get 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.460
 one of the vehicles of humans 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.660
 kessel 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.660
 blanchett of him the good 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.290
 well as we see signs form futuristic helicopter 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.500
 use as in the movie 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.390
 filmmakers 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.390
 big guns to yours 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.460
 these to the atrium of the sitas 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.520
 that also look very nice 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.050
 the cam and half 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.620
 there you can go 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.190
 He was born 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.460
 Iniesta had a goal in six venues 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.150
 and they are articulated 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.890
 both 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.380
 All these vehicles require assembly 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.799
 this forum particularly a little more complex since it cost me work 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.710
 whole one of these 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.710
 the ice circular 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.650
 100 who would have liked this good toy 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.530
 the escort is very good 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.530
 sd just like a pimpina 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.779
 Mars would have done a better job with painting this could 

00:02:09.779 --> 00:02:11.269
 have stood out about him 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.879
 or many other toys 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:15.469
 but in 100 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:18.079
 it is without fear 

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:20.139
 it looks like yes with the movie 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.869
 as a display and it looks very good 

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:26.579
 like a toy I think it would be very good to be a good detail for a 

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.429
 boy 

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:29.339
 this event 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:32.779
 there are some missiles sejil the triples 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:35.779
 of wasp 1 

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:40.779
 I killed him decided 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:43.779
 given the impact towards the west city 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:46.169
 3d technology 

00:02:46.169 --> 00:02:49.179
 gimp even for the texas hills with this 

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:51.139
 kessel aita 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:54.129
 in history I find it very interesting because 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.809
 It is the first line 

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:59.189
 d sources that I see that have something similar good 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:00.629
 the draw 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:02.439
 that's it 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:05.499
 a minor sample the page of avatar monkeys 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:07.469
 i 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:10.159
 you will have a 3d figure 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:11.939
 in the concentration 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.479
 later 

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:16.479
 I will show you 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.879
 well above all especially 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:26.219
 I believe that 

00:03:26.219 --> 00:03:28.289
 you're an avatar fan 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:31.219
 if you like to collect 

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:34.069
 you like to collect this kind of stuff 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.279
 l is health 

00:03:36.279 --> 00:03:37.619
 it's worth buying 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.489
 they look great 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:43.690
 I'm really solid so we're interested in seeing champion 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:48.579
 other monkeys 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.109
 I think it was 9 points 5 

00:03:53.109 --> 00:03:55.609
 from 10 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:58.939
 this figure could have been outstanding if he had had a better 

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:02.219
 paint job in the details 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:03.859
 and some lights 

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:05.419
 poveda our good 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.679
 some sound of the whole very well 

00:04:08.679 --> 00:04:10.169
 well that was him 

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:13.169
 the video review of the toy fights daily and every night 

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.739
 pettway dwindles 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:17.430
 we're leaving tomorrow 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.850
 country is not to say all the posts
