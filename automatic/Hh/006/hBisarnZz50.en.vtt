 Aluminum repair bodywork 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.620
 Repair is becoming more and more important there 

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.740
 to have tools we are here 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.750
 carbon in hall 11.0 on the 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.480
 automechanika with me is the 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.860
 sales manager of carbon sigi müller 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.369
 I am very happy that you are here 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.430
 Mr. Müller , there was the ten years ago 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.740
 first appearance of the ecosystem here in 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.330
 frankfurt at the automechanika today 

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:38.579
 they have a very big very wide 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.890
 accepted international stand where 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.540
 the secret of success of carbon 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.610
 quite simply on the name of me often wonder 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.170
 Joking aside the majority where we are 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.090
 meanwhile market look out 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.830
 Rehborn lackierer where many system 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.930
 have decided meanwhile great 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:57.120
 breakfast Germany is simply the 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.950
 sustainability yes, the professionalism 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.870
 the package whole package with 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:02.220
 refer marketing support yes 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.510
 should mobile industry the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.729
 paint manufacturer with in the boot 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.350
 Thus, the customer has a set up we have 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.820
 In any case, we motorsport again 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.500
 poleposition has and accordingly 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.790
 develops automatically activate 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:16.740
 title la roja and that is special 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.420
 among other things the ease if 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.119
 Take your hand like the Pole 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.070
 Master me whatever material you need 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.659
 is that we have aluminum everywhere 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.509
 Titan alloyed components 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.159
 So we have a good ergonomics though 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.090
 It's always such a small part of you 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.920
 have to testify as she is very 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.359
 easy to learn a lot yes and that 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.450
 Employee has in each area 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:41.729
 it just feels good to do it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.829
 possibility of juggling with the sheet metal 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.969
 and was very important, everyone is hurt 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.530
 has its own character like us 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.869
 people smoke so there is none 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.819
 standard tools and should be with us 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.560
 the miracle we have with their power 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.929
 press with adhesive technology all around 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.310
 System was developed in the body shop 

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.560
 and paint the possibility there 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.810
 to be of a wise and fall 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.850
 doing to respond lasting on the market 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.560
 new style reinmache repair 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.280
 demands the market demands the 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.200
 insurance 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.810
 he is not just one by now 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 crafts but it in management 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.000
 body repair to set 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.580
 where exactly is the profit of use for 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.370
 the specialist company if he has the system 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.410
 quite a bit of the prophet if they are 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.670
 some three windows have if they 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.010
 drive or drive by car 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.019
 have to halve the work process 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.879
 If you can just have a short time if 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.910
 we look all the way up , we have that 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:33.280
 A5 had you new vehicle 1000 pages 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:35.620
 kilometer far one broke 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.390
 we have set the stand around 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.670
 50% time saved from the body 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:41.769
 work and accordingly is his 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.930
 Operation the 50 percent use in the 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:45.370
 preparation and then not only 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.739
 Crafts but only management like 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.840
 said yes to play like I do 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.310
 then the invoice we have that 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.780
 big topic here at the events 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.150
 at the automechanika in recent 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.879
 aluminum has come the days 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:01.870
 material mix is ​​still on the rise 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:04.180
 There are also special aluminum on 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.709
 aluminum set what you offer 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.629
 how do you assess the development in 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.670
 the area simply by the 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:11.650
 Lightweight construction on the market is becoming more and more so 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.660
 meanwhile we have vehicles 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.170
 talk about cfk monocoque chassis 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.480
 motor sport now the parts come mark 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:20.920
 pure yes aluminum is always more if 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.980
 the vehicles must be lighter yes 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.799
 to bring the Co2 limited wonder 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.810
 to be directed downwards and thus with 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.579
 aluminum building materials yes a reason 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.079
 material easily easy riske sheet metal and 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.180
 Today we have the tooth and vehicles 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.370
 with aluminum iron we have 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.019
 Accordingly, articles and so on 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.819
 further where but the fitter not at all 

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.410
 white is aluminum or steel if now 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.209
 is not deposited in any escape currency 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.639
 which portal medium is the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.310
 crack point the alu parts of relatively 

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:48.609
 very expensive we always talk about 45 6 800 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.650
 Euro 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:53.470
 then prefer to sell my work hours 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:55.210
 so under the more money earned stroked 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.090
 we'll look at each other like one 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.920
 repair can look like one 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.920
 lamborghini standing here at the stand 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.530
 the miracle system is out 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.750
 several building blocks together and the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.390
 Building blocks are designed to be like you 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:13.640
 repaired and examined first the 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.810
 Damage that is authoritative 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.030
 especially with the aluminum 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.160
 Repair and then I try 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.280
 I want to be gentle 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.650
 start with the adhesive technique search me 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:27.290
 my adhesive pads bring out the ones on the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.780
 Damage on must the glue then 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.340
 cure accordingly and 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.800
 melt glue no two components 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:36.290
 glue also very user friendly 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.030
 is and it takes about five minutes 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.340
 then the train is ready 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.520
 and then I can pull the appropriate train 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.800
 attach tool and start the 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.050
 Do not massage out damage site 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.550
 work striking but make out 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.750
 is a significant advantage and 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:56.350
 Part of the marketing 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.660
 furthermore , it is so that we 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.000
 after this selection process already so 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:04.100
 far are we under tension that 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.530
 tap and then remove paint and 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.860
 then work with the pid technique and 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:11.330
 this technique does not hurt the deep ones 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.919
 layer but only welds in the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.560
 surface and then it repeats itself 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:18.200
 keep the tap under tension and 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:20.540
 Last but not least we have 1 pot intimately 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.380
 stand and especially in the alu area 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.380
 it is very important
