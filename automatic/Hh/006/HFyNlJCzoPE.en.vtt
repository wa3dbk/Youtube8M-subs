00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.060
 hello today i want the products 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.650
 I show in the last months 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.509
 I have tested and that at all 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.680
 Did not like it because there 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.540
 meanwhile a few again 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.880
 Gathered God is not so many 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.620
 like in my last video and 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.030
 That's why I thought I was warning you 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.440
 I wish these products and that 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.420
 we'll have a lot of fun 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.279
 right with the most expensive product 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.350
 I recommend that too with one 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.900
 crying and a laughing eye 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.400
 so to speak that the forex poster palette 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.740
 by smash box and that's meanwhile 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.750
 Also available in Germany and the 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.189
 problem is not the whole 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.989
 palette for the lower meppen 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.149
 eyeshadows are fantastic 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.520
 really good the problem are the 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.500
 upper the upper ones are glittering and 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 do not have good fare duties and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.180
 martin spitzer everywhere in the face and it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.890
 is just so annoying and I think so 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.469
 totally a pity at a palette 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.390
 the over 40 euro costs expected 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:53.399
 but that the whole product 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.329
 works and not just the one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.070
 half of it 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.449
 i will just keep it for the 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.370
 bottom matte eyeshadow because the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.199
 but I have really great finds 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.149
 really a pity that they are at the top 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.799
 eyeshadow simply glittering who did 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.020
 have taken and not shimmering with 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.330
 which one can work then one 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.950
 flop product is this peninsula of 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.439
 evelyn and I do not really know 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.200
 as he calls himself laptop something 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.820
 presumably that's from the optical side 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.390
 that's a typical buffer brush 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.729
 So a flat so flat 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.259
 Cut off and brush the man 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:26.070
 can use for example foundation 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.070
 apply 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 problem here is that is too tight 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.070
 bound 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.549
 So I have several brushes in the art 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.770
 and this one is so solid that he 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.630
 First, a lot of product at least suggested 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.479
 I have the experience and also 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.130
 the whole not distributed but stop 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.470
 just push back and forth 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 because the bristles are so relentless 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.250
 and close that I need just simply a 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.710
 first windows or pleasant face 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.899
 if you use this and me 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.850
 do not need a brush of the foundation 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.680
 note from a to b he shoves the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.659
 already a work in the skin because of that 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.640
 he unfortunately is for me im 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.110
 misses another product and that is 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.229
 I really am sorry and that is the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.229
 the 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.250
 okay in the color color 14 roos velvet among other things 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.500
 my french is already a while 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.050
 In any case, they are quite classic 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.390
 do pink and I have it at yves 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.980
 Rocher taken away from the event so 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.920
 I got there in a good way 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.990
 and the color donation is great the dect in 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.030
 One in a shift I was 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.430
 really excited at first though 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.820
 within several, so few 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.190
 less than a day and hours 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.660
 is already starting to splinter and that 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:42.550
 I think I can not do that and not 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.080
 only with me I have it mine too 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.850
 best friend to try out 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.380
 and with her what exactly there had 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.900
 within a few hours already 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:52.540
 started to loose at the top 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.010
 and that's just simply not in 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.730
 nail polish should have been longer than one 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.010
 hold day 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.290
 then I was disappointed with the sps 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.910
 mascara of essens that's such a white one 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.550
 great mascara you under the 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.230
 should wear mascara and the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:07.000
 then stop more volume swung 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.230
 and to extend the eyelashes 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.209
 she does not care about her 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.880
 prolonged metternich eyelashes 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.800
 This makes it just lumpy and no matter if 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.690
 applying it and then directly 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.060
 mascara or on it or whether one 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.500
 I have both tried it 

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.510
 just does not do easy 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.209
 not what she should and therefore 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.489
 wasted money 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.910
 also of essens the crystal one 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.010
 in the color what is the name of the blue heaven 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.530
 it's really pretty and it's like that 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.100
 a great duo kromer blue purple 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.620
 shimmering smaller but I do not know if 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.780
 I caught 1 monday product though 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.400
 The brush is totally frayed with it 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.110
 you can not do anything that is so wide 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.330
 I could paint a wall with it 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.810
 but do not draw a single line 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.190
 So no idea somehow I hope 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.750
 that this is a production error and 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.610
 but that it has since caught when good 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.470
 that happens more often than that 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.850
 then brush can be so messed up 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.100
 the product just did not use 

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:07.390
 and that 's why it's so thin so the 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:08.980
 lace is so thin, I'm coming too 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.269
 my other a brush not pure 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.930
 That's why I can just help you now 

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.730
 do not use 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:13.440
 that we are not totally sorry about the 

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.420
 amount of lima 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.980
 I have the precise alico part 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.140
 ever in a used up video 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.750
 spoken and that is a fixed 

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.550
 pen liner by maybelline something like that 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.670
 or visually just like that 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.140
 Manhattan a macinga only clear 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.680
 more expensive costs more than double 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:34.830
 and this is the color brown and there 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.720
 is absolutely good, so I really am 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.490
 I used that first and have 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.160
 already noticed how dad did not exist 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.060
 so fluid who does not cover well and then 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.610
 I thought so well then I just go 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.900
 again over it and with the second 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:46.770
 layer I have then the lower layer 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.990
 wiped away again 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.940
 Thanks, I have one more here 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.110
 tried and every time it became 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:55.230
 worse and then I have him for 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.580
 Leave a month and wanted him 

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:59.280
 then give another chance and about 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.330
 So it was easy to dry 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.120
 all wrong 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:06.360
 I think the fingers of 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.700
 the manhattan of the fog in the master 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:09.980
 the freestylers of manhattan are a lot 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.270
 better and cheaper 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.620
 but I do not perhaps have 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:15.090
 I also here again on Mondays product 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.710
 if you get it good 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:19.380
 should have made experiences then 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.950
 let me have your experiences with yours 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.240
 comments to 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.860
 that would interest me because 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.060
 maybe I just have it 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:28.590
 really just bad luck and also that 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:30.390
 last product in this video is from 

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:32.850
 maybelline and actually i like myself 

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:34.950
 berlin product is happy but the 

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.400
 eyeshadow around that i will take a bow 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.600
 do 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:41.880
 that's it nokias what not quattro or 

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.100
 like the hot ones in the color naturals 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:45.419
 smogs and the colors themselves 

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:48.450
 that's why I have it 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:50.190
 sold the problem is only apart 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.070
 of the brightest color here 

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:55.560
 if you apply these three colors and 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:58.260
 dazzles all look the same 

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.490
 it's really identical and I think 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:02.340
 also that they are not very good 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:03.840
 dazzle and the colors are on 

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:05.970
 already not too 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.410
 and similar but between the middle 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:08.820
 color is much warmer than that 

00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:11.130
 but if you like the whole thing with the 

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:13.020
 brush blinded something now 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.910
 work costs then you can see that too 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:16.590
 not anymore and I do not understand why 

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.419
 you make four colors a palette pure 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:20.610
 should be identical if three colors 

00:06:18.419 --> 00:06:22.710
 as soon as you have processed them there 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.870
 I was really disappointed, I'm fine 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.490
 work with it 

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.870
 every time I tried it 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:28.190
 just nothing so every time I do 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.620
 make me with it says after that 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:31.730
 as if someone had content with me 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:33.800
 a muddy fist in the face 

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:37.010
 it's not like that 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:42.500
 the look I wanted and that's why 

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:44.930
 nee and cool maybelline yes those were the 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.890
 products that I did not like 

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.170
 have lately 

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:51.200
 I hope that this is the next time 

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:52.730
 Do not listen today because I have to 

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:54.470
 your products at home i do not like 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:57.400
 that's just kind of stupid but 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:59.510
 I thought I would warn you if you did 

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:01.700
 want to buy some of these products 

00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:02.630
 if he tested it himself and 

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:03.560
 you have other experiences with it 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:05.120
 made and writes it in the 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:06.860
 Comments that also helpful 

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.020
 for the others I link you here 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:11.230
 now the last video with products 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.610
 I did not like it 

00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.870
 next to me that is much longer than 

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.550

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:21.020
 about it too and a bit 

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.370
 I still show a more positive mood 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:23.810

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:25.370

00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.930
 favorites for 2014 

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:28.820
