00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.980
 guys again hello again with us 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.280
 the main character of the release is eternal young 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.559
 jay-z almost and then today will be the topic 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.740
 this cooling system on the brand is shaped 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:20.220
 jzx90 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:24.119
 he soarer old this alteration with 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:27.750
 hydra pump with hydraulics on 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.230
 viscous coupling ordinary as a jzx100 on 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.539
 under contract 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.219
 why would you interrupt you right away why is it 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:38.030
 you need to understand what to be now 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:41.129
 rework but why is this game worth 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.110
 jzx90 very old cooling system 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:47.579
 using hydraulic fluid like 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.149
 power steering is essentially a pump 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:53.850
 which as gidrach pumps fluid worth 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.579
 hydra fan on radiator with 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.690
 hose systems this is all reported under 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.579
 high pressure 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:04.949
 it all chokes on the hydra fan and how 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.530
 one weakest spot is known 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.140
 90 brand is a high pressure hose on 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.229
 fan always 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.570
 virtually lost time flows 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.700
 liquid goes away you purchase 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.770
 overheat and so on it's like 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.460
 plus this pump when turned on full 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 power squander engine that is 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:30.780
 very sensibly eats horsepower here 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.930
 and it takes a lot of space already cumbersome 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.250
 a lot of barrels hoses all sorts but it's not all 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.500
 need can install 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.380
 electric fans and put the usual 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.960
 pump and free mass 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.510
 place here either to put viscous coupling 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.060
 jzx100 

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:51.140
 how to do it all really very 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.180
 just you turn off the regular pump 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.260
 the whole is just the front wall 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:04.170
 I do not unscrew the back of the standard 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:05.910
 and completely and doing there for you 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.009
 this will need to buy back 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.020
 wall and eat it on the code 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.410
 you can buy it the back wall of the pump 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.240
 jzx100 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:19.560
 well or from any viscous again jay-z then 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:23.820
 it may be 2 jay z 1 it may not matter 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.160
 to be aristo 147 

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:30.000
 store say order this back 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.170
 part of it fit all your nipples and 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.200
 hoses and tubes are all the same as in 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.030
 90 but it is much more compact and the front 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:40.890
 Part of the pump can be bought in the store 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.930
 New no need to buy stuffy can 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.300
 rear rack buy a bu ear at the very 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.990
 In fact, the front part can be bought new in 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.970
 the store 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.989
 there it is a jembe firm we are releasing 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.620
 korean taiwanese pumps 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.959
 pretty good screw here 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.180
 bandage coupling and install a radiator from 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.980
 jzx100 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.230
 coupling bunch with diffuser and you 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.700
 get rid of that bunch of hoses in 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.150
 hydraulics , etc. etc. 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.000
 well, there is a solution of course more seriously 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.260
 is to install the electric pump 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:17.910
 American manufacturers tue he is very 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:20.580
 there are many and the bosch company produces everything 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.730
 the same thing in a regular place can 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.470
 use an electric fan to this 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.580
 the whole business because there is viscous coupling 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:33.680
 you will not install a problem with it 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.680
 overheating and boiling do not threaten you 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:40.280
 no belt you have and no pardon 

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:42.189
 the belt you have to buy is similar 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.610
 jzx100 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:49.400
 because 90 belt is a little longer 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:54.519
 as skif on a computer with hydraulics 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:59.390
 a little more here and have 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:02.390
 purchase somewhere 0 and head off in himself either 

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:04.250
 aluminum new purchase pulley 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.440
 drive belt mount 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:10.280
 because on the pump he won't go to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:13.549
 set 0 if you purchased from 100 

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:15.799
 brand whole pump you can install 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:18.400
 entirely i think there will be a bundled pulley 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:22.100
 and you bolts all relevant 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:24.050
 thermostat go and fit your all 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:26.990
 tosolnye pipes connected so 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.760
 say bolt well here if with my 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.460
 hands is the approximate budget of this 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:34.850
 activities but with the current dollar rate 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.539
 back now costs about 4 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:43.160
 700 5000 is new and if you take 

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:45.349
 here the whole pump will cost 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:48.289
 in the region of 5000 in the collection 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:52.070
 Well, 5-6 this dependence and who in what 

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:56.840
 Much well here is a new belt store I do not 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:58.699
 I know how much it costs and pulley well if 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.610
 pin pulley you will have kit a 

00:04:58.699 --> 00:05:07.460
 if you take everything new the pump is wearing 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:10.910
 about 2000 rubles somewhere 2 800 and the back 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.620
 wall well it's 4 700 to 5000 but this 

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:14.500
 depending on the dollar per day 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:17.780
 purchases 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.479
 well actually everything is somewhere in the area well 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.699
 shorter than the top ten but you decide 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.040
 very significant problem with overheating and 

00:05:23.699 --> 00:05:29.020
 with motor unloading and if not 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.400
 use also viscous coupling install 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:32.979
 electric fans you engine 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.270
 relieve it even more because i 

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.930
 ska coupling has mass 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:40.870
 has air resistance because 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:42.940
 the fan is very big but that's it 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:46.120
 further and the like if set 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:49.389
 aluminum pulleys you also weight 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:54.090
 reduce and thoroughly on the crankshaft well 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:54.090
 actually everything is great
