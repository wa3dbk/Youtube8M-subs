00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:12.470
 This is for us to remove we disconnect the sensor from 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:19.519
 bs disconnect the brake from the rack and go 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.519
 starting to detach the top nut 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:36.210
 stabilizer keys we need here 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:38.300
 18 so much disconnected now to us 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.339
 need to connect 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.109
 that is so much 120 or now we 

00:00:41.339 --> 00:00:46.819
 disconnect here in this place the rack itself 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:50.299
 arterton and 

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:54.089
 knuckle bolts here 

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:57.499
 the usual way caught dozens again 

00:00:54.089 --> 00:01:04.100
 Do not break apart, that is, we shoot safely 

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.100
 do not fear anything and then put back 1 

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:10.939
 empty lining 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:14.060
 all disconnected and we failed 

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:19.780
 because we are already in advance 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 removed the plastic clips under the hood 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:31.490
 stand know starting with her work 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:35.240
 we spring up to unscrew then 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.420
 he is a nut for something and stand still 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:37.420
 bearing 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.100
 we have such screeds 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.700
 stretch the springs 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:54.000
 spring 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.000
 pulled together here we were born 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:02.799
 now to unscrew the nut from the stem 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:09.489
 we need an asterisk who is 50 long 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:10.660
 and head for 21 preferably head here 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:15.300
 here with grooves 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:19.660
 spanner but we did not find this, and 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:25.299
 we now have gas key 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:29.110
 use before removing the rack 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:34.110
 we made a stock nut in advance 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.110
 so that it was more convenient and unscrewing 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:46.280
 head from 10 to do when 50 how 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:50.930
 times under her gas key under the head 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.920
 i start to unscrew the nut holding 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:06.670
 what 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:03:11.790
 head disassemble 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.790
 how can we see the plate on the flight net 

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:24.540
 take out the bearing itself on the supports 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.540
 stand bye side 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:33.610
 Now we will open it and see that there 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.610
 going on 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.310
 he pretty easily understands 

00:03:45.780 --> 00:04:00.310
 a little awry nothing now 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:04:04.560
 and we see all that's there is such a very, 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.560
 rusty dirty picture 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:11.920
 grease 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:16.590
 jock something like left over 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:16.590
 whiskey give as they said 3 for 1 are 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.360
 some 

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:27.850
 washed honor is humming with new grease and 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:33.300
 put back but we will not do that 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:45.479
 because we bought a new driver of it 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:45.479
 pupils we took the firm reliance on 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.570
 set in place now it was 

00:04:50.410 --> 00:05:00.450
 we can see poprus over there under the lever 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:04.520
 lie and therefore naturally 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.349
 we lower the car to our stand 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:12.370
 became a herd in place and fix the two 

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:12.370
 these half rings 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.860
 2 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.400
 second create levay 

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:32.330
 I do not know 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.330
 for 

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:43.470
 very convenient as the course is there 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.330
 the topic then hurt somehow polska 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:55.699
 not enough carried away 

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.699
 maxim rub 

00:05:56.019 --> 00:06:03.759
 stand stub put in place us 

00:05:59.899 --> 00:06:03.759
 need to lower the car 

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:18.090
 still 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:34.930
 but here we see yes here it is in our place 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:37.030
 everything keeps 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.620
 but naturally after installation 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.620
 we stand her about traction 

00:06:55.969 --> 00:07:04.819
 pretty sure in winter since we had it 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:07.389
 not stretched and after replacing it with us too 

00:07:04.819 --> 00:07:07.389
 stretch out 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.630
 ok of course 

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:44.750
 but now everything
