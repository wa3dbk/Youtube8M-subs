00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
seconds for a half mile which means he's

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.400 
seconds for a half mile which means he's
got<00:02:47.670> a<00:02:47.700> lot<00:02:47.970> of<00:02:48.120> speed<00:02:48.359> what<00:02:48.989> he's<00:02:49.109> trying<00:02:49.380> to

got a lot of speed what he's trying to

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.570 
got a lot of speed what he's trying to
do<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.799> think<00:02:49.980> is<00:02:50.310> control<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.910> race

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
seconds for the second quarter they

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:02.020
