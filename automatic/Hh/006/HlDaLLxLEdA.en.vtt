00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.210
 modern societies need 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.280
 energy resources to function and its 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.030
 responsible consumption is the key to your 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.030
 advance in the future 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.690
 this is the reason why the ucam has 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.330
 created the efficiency demonstrator 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.500
 energy infrastructure to 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.600
 community disposition 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.300
 university that implements a campus 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.789
 sustainable 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.160
 from renewable resources such as 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.840
 wind and the sun the demonstrator allows 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.270
 the storage of electrical energy 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.860
 for multiple purposes like charging 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.769
 of electric vehicles computers 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.989
 laptops and mobile devices as well 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.809
 as space efficient lighting 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.610
 and common areas also by heat 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.530
 of the earth's subsoil you get 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.360
 geothermal energy used for the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.390
 heating of sanitary water and the 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:56.160
 air conditioning of rooms and classrooms 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.890
 the workshop is located in the facilities 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.930
 of the ucam racing and the car team 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.430
 ecological aspects of the university in which 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.550
 students from different countries collaborate 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.550
 qualifications 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.620
 In turn, the demonstrator hosts a 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.420
 complete laboratory intended formulated 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.610
 to the practical quality training of 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.170
 degree and postgraduate and on the other to the 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.060
 research on energy 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.060
 Renewables and energy efficiency 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.370
 the demonstrator is in turn a space of 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.950
 collaboration between the university and 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:30.240
 companies whose support will be possible 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.220
 the development of studies and 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.270
 investigations that lead to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.270
 products and patents 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.290
 energy is increasingly necessary and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.000
 it is essential to make everyone aware of 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.979
 its responsible use efficiency 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.250
 Energy is the key to 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:53.420
 counter sustainability 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.420
 energy efficiency
