place it so start with the center you
wanted<00:03:54.380> to<00:03:54.530> start<00:03:54.829> with<00:03:55.040> the<00:03:55.160> medium<00:03:55.640> alright

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
wanted to start with the medium alright

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.500 
wanted to start with the medium alright
so<00:03:57.110> we're<00:03:57.230> just<00:03:57.260> going<00:03:57.530> to<00:03:57.850> pluck<00:03:58.850> one<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.420> the

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
so we're just going to pluck one of the

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.660 
so we're just going to pluck one of the
mediums<00:03:59.959> of<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.709> container<00:04:01.070> now<00:04:01.280> you<00:04:01.340> have<00:04:01.549> to

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
mediums of the container now you have to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.460 
mediums of the container now you have to
do<00:04:01.820> this<00:04:02.000> really<00:04:02.420> carefully<00:04:02.600> so<00:04:03.049> that<00:04:03.079> you

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
do this really carefully so that you

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:11.500 
do this really carefully so that you
don't<00:04:04.690> deform<00:04:05.690> the<00:04:06.280> hair<00:04:08.350> and<00:04:10.150> in<00:04:11.150> most<00:04:11.329> cases

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
don't deform the hair and in most cases

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:17.210 
don't deform the hair and in most cases
it<00:04:12.019> just<00:04:12.170> comes<00:04:12.350> off<00:04:12.470> really<00:04:12.769> easily

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.099 

so<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.370> best<00:04:18.519> way<00:04:18.760> is<00:04:18.940> to<00:04:18.970> pick<00:04:19.239> it<00:04:19.359> up<00:04:19.510> like

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
so the best way is to pick it up like

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.230 
so the best way is to pick it up like
that<00:04:20.139> all<00:04:21.130> right<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:21.609> we're<00:04:21.730> going<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.000> dip

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
that all right and we're going to dip

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:29.010 
that all right and we're going to dip
that<00:04:23.520> and<00:04:24.840> glue<00:04:25.840> so<00:04:26.050> it's<00:04:26.229> just<00:04:26.560> the<00:04:27.720> it's<00:04:28.720> just

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
that and glue so it's just the it's just

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.400 
that and glue so it's just the it's just
the<00:04:29.169> roots<00:04:29.440> all<00:04:29.949> right<00:04:30.330> that's<00:04:31.330> dipped<00:04:32.080> in

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:32.410 
the roots all right that's dipped in

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.090 
the roots all right that's dipped in
glue<00:04:33.389> let's<00:04:34.389> just<00:04:34.930> hold<00:04:35.110> that<00:04:35.260> for<00:04:35.889> a<00:04:35.919> couple

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
glue let's just hold that for a couple

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.409 
glue let's just hold that for a couple
second<00:04:36.669> and<00:04:36.850> then<00:04:37.180> we're<00:04:37.660> going<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.930> apply<00:04:38.199> it

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
second and then we're going to apply it

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:45.030 
second and then we're going to apply it
right<00:04:40.419> in<00:04:40.690> the<00:04:40.810> middle<00:04:43.260> place<00:04:44.260> the<00:04:44.590> medium

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:45.040 
right in the middle place the medium

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:47.550 
right in the middle place the medium
false<00:04:45.520> eyelash<00:04:46.150> individual<00:04:46.810> eyelash<00:04:47.260> right

false eyelash individual eyelash right

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:50.490 
false eyelash individual eyelash right
in<00:04:47.680> the<00:04:47.740> center<00:04:48.130> and<00:04:48.389> make<00:04:49.389> sure<00:04:49.419> that<00:04:49.630> it's<00:04:50.200> as

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
in the center and make sure that it's as

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.490

close as possible to your real lashes

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:56.070 
close as possible to your real lashes
and<00:04:53.919> then<00:04:54.010> just<00:04:54.250> let<00:04:54.460> that<00:04:54.610> sit<00:04:55.060> for<00:04:55.090> the<00:04:55.840> glue

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
and then just let that sit for the glue

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.719 
and then just let that sit for the glue
to<00:04:56.110> set<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.770> then<00:04:57.760> work<00:04:57.940> on<00:04:58.060> the<00:04:58.180> outer<00:04:58.330> corner

00:04:59.719 --> 00:04:59.729 
to set and then work on the outer corner

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.090 
to set and then work on the outer corner
now<00:05:00.729> for<00:05:00.970> a<00:05:01.000> more<00:05:01.210> natural<00:05:01.240> look<00:05:01.720> place<00:05:02.500> a<00:05:02.770> long

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.100 
now for a more natural look place a long
