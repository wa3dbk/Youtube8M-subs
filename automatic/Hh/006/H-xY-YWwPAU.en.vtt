00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
sets in the book to do it in the oven

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.659 
sets in the book to do it in the oven
under<00:00:27.659> the<00:00:27.779> broiler<00:00:28.099> you<00:00:29.099> want<00:00:29.310> them<00:00:29.429> almost

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
under the broiler you want them almost

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.370 
under the broiler you want them almost
all<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.210> way<00:00:30.239> cooked<00:00:30.630> before<00:00:30.869> you<00:00:31.140> start

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
all the way cooked before you start

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
all the way cooked before you start
glazing<00:00:31.589> them<00:00:31.919> you<00:00:32.369> can<00:00:32.520> also<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.940> them<00:00:33.060> on<00:00:33.150> a

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.640 
this so nice and brown the bouquet garni
and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:04.080> we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.320> return<00:01:04.769> our<00:01:05.160> meat

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
and then we're going to return our meat

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.830 
and then we're going to return our meat
in<00:01:07.650> this<00:01:08.280> recipe<00:01:08.729> what<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.060> traditionally<00:01:09.299> use

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
in this recipe what I traditionally use

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.810 
in this recipe what I traditionally use
as<00:01:10.020> a<00:01:10.110> traditional<00:01:10.320> use<00:01:10.740> vinegar<00:01:11.040> because

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
as a traditional use vinegar because

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.030 
as a traditional use vinegar because
things<00:01:12.270> your<00:01:12.540> mouth<00:01:12.750> gets<00:01:13.049> really<00:01:13.439> happy<00:01:13.860> when

wanted to do this time instead because

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.179 
wanted to do this time instead because

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
awesome YUM alright so we've got all

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.260 
awesome YUM alright so we've got all
these<00:01:49.740> bits<00:01:50.039> and<00:01:50.250> pieces<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.820> we've<00:01:50.909> got<00:01:51.090> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
these bits and pieces and we've got the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.899 
these bits and pieces and we've got the
carrots<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:52.020> here<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.500> onion<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.250> I<00:01:53.759> got

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
carrots in here in the onion and I got

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.679 
carrots in here in the onion and I got
to<00:01:54.000> find<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.329> bouquet<00:01:54.719> garni<00:01:56.390> these<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.570> the

Bourbon sweet potatoes so instead of

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.420 
Bourbon sweet potatoes so instead of
using<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:00.689> brown<00:02:00.960> sugar<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.619> dish<00:02:01.890> we're

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
using the brown sugar in this dish we're

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.450 
using the brown sugar in this dish we're
going<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.820> we're<00:02:03.270> going<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.859> use<00:02:04.859> some<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.310> the

going to we're going to use some of the

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.639 
going to we're going to use some of the
barq's<00:02:05.759> root<00:02:05.850> beer<00:02:06.210> so<00:02:06.750> I<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.140> root<00:02:07.380> beer

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
barq's root beer so I have the root beer

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.900 
barq's root beer so I have the root beer
and<00:02:08.090> then<00:02:09.090> butter<00:02:12.470> it's<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.800> all<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> you<00:02:14.400> but
