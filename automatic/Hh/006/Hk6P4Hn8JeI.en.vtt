00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.319
 of the oldest is in the body days 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:06.609
 where two people so they played in 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:13.019
 that state 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.019
 the oldest group of the last century 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.449
 the new stadium we will win the team 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:26.050
 of the guadalajara 12 0 2 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.970
 goals 7 that's nice little but 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.640

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:34.010
 fire has see love and spirit of him 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.800
 the party defines something from a 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.520
 magnificent play great play and no longer 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:42.190

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.190
 yes yes it is very important 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:01:02.360
 maybe the youngest to me is about 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.360
 look for the ball 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.070
 it will be because it does not make movement 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.000
 but makes good contact with the ball 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.000
 and it 's fine 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:28.319
 many and many is like the one that comments 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.780
 the touch that the important moment the 

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:35.050
 Fine touch cost them a little work 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.409
 it would be very hasty this 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.330
 s 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:40.979
 and above all of the level that participated 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:46.470
 Javier also appealing the number he cited 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:48.119
 there those who want 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.259
 lower the ball community the feeling 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.720
 that can start from the first 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.210
 intention for the sector is public by 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.250
 left has an audit but it does not 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.590
 by the benders in the bad spells 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.689
 who usually lose their heads 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.140
 this case of de nigris is very located 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.360
 he knows he is in debt or face 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.500
 is a guy who works a lot is very 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.980
 delicate 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.580
 the one that craves because we're all 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.810
 well and there are those who want to dominate and 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.330
 recharge your left side with so much 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:24.780

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.780

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.780
 good 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.210

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.990
