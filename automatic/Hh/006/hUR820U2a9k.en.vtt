00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello I hope you go 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.879
 by the way today I'm coming back for 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.740
 a new video that will be quite short 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:10.620
 it's a mini review 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.660
 so I think it will be a new 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 style of videos that will be on my 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 chain I find it interesting to you 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:19.350
 do a mini review on a product that 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.609
 I loved a crush or a beautiful 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.289
 discovery 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.240
 instead of waiting for the favorites of the month 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.060
 where ben voila I speak to you enough 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.820
 quickly I thought it was 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.669
 can be interesting to make you 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.410
 outright a little review on such or 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.730
 such product that I really loved 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.120
 so it's a first one I've told you 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.219
 already spoken is the body milk under the 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.920
 shower of the Nivea brand 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.480
 so this is a new discovery a 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.989
 big favorite and it's a product 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:51.360
 which I would not do without anymore so 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.989
 present like these it's a format 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.430
 of 250 milliliters so me a g for 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.210
 dry skin 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:03.989
 so there is also for skins 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:06.060
 normal if I'm not mistaken so in 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.159
 does the principle of this product it's 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.110
 simply to come and hydrate you 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.439
 the skin to avoid that out of the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.299
 shower 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:16.080
 you apply your body butter 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:19.140
 your body milk etc since 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.970
 it's true that me personally down 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.680
 sometimes I find it a bit boring 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.290
 get out of the shower it is still necessary that 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.759
 I pass a product to hydrate my 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.049
 skin because I have skin that pulls at 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.450
 I have dry skin etc 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:32.970
 and so when I saw the ad I got 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.970
 said why not tested it me more 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.950
 I love the Nivea brand and the smell is 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
 just a killing 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.369
 it really smells like the level cream you 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.680
 find in the little point it's 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.840
 exactly the same smell so me who 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.220
 am a fan of this smell frankly 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.229
 so I love for using this 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.530
 product it's pretty simple in you you 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.149
 wash with your usual shower bath 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.600
 you rinse yourself and then you come 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.119
 apply this milk for the shower so 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 you just apply it by hand you in 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.520
 put everywhere you put it especially at 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.670
 level of areas to scratch waters 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:13.370
 the driest ones and then rinse yourself 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.970
 and there you have a skin but a 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:20.150
 sweetness it's amazing you have 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:25.220
 really very soft very smooth skin 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.720
 you feel that there is a film not 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.190
 fat because it's not at all fat 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.110
 but you feel that there is something 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.629
 on your skin like when you 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:35.120
 apply a cream so rinse 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.040
 then you dry normally and 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.530
 I can tell you that your skin is 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:42.049
 hyper hydrate and you really have not 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.170
 need to hydrate yourself with a milk 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:47.450
 for the body or whatever that does not leave 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.160
 of fat film that's what I like 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.959
 a lot is that the product has already 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.340
 penetrated your skin under the touch 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.410
 which is great is that you can 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.269
 directly dressing yourself behind it 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.220
 to say that sometimes when we go out of the 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.900
 shower we do without the cream and 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.160
 you want to dress it down with glue 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.840
 clothes you have to wait until the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.220
 product is well penetrated etc 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.110
 I can tell you that if you want 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.090
 donned jeans after the shower 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.040
 there is no problem it's not going at all 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:13.400
 paste it leaves no residue on 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.410
 the skin and frankly the smell is great 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.030
 long time 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.190
 I love this product I use it 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.819
 also for monfils who has skin 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.170
 very dry because frankly 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.730
 time he does not want me at all 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:28.970
 cream on the whole body 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.639
 after the shower and frankly I 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:33.470
 wash with that and it's just awesome ago 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:35.989
 hydrated skin of wanderings no longer needed 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.519
 to spread it with cream after bathing 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.590
 so here they are as they say 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.599
 your wet skin quickly assimilates 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.579
 the nourishing formula it is very fast 

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:46.430
 absorbed so that's how I wanted to 10 

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:49.790
 and it's magic frankly I love it 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.200
 product I would not really do without it 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.730
 I would not do without myself who has the 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.329
 very dry skin right now and who 

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:56.480
 tugs 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:04:00.109
 it soothed me a lot and I use to 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.030
 each shower so frankly but 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:03.680
 body butter I think they're going 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:05.840
 stay a little while in the drawer and 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:07.790
 so here it is in any case it's really a 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.370
 favorite product a product 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.290
 darling and frankly I tell you 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:13.579
 recommend especially if you have skin 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.930
 very dry 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.329
 I think it can 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.699
 really relieve you in any case on 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:22.400
 it makes me miracles I really 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:24.860
 a very very soft skin and that's 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.389
 really an effect that stay up to the 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.460
 next shower ans emma something 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:30.530
 which will have an effect for a few 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.350
 hours or tomorrow your skin is going 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:36.440

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.530
 so you can find this product in 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.229

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:43.820
