good<00:00:27.359> question<00:00:27.810> my<00:00:28.140> take<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.590> it<00:00:28.650> personally

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
good question my take on it personally

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.520 
good question my take on it personally
when<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.080> see<00:00:31.529> an<00:00:32.189> f1<00:00:32.790> controller<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.600> when<00:00:34.500> I

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
when I see an f1 controller and when I

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.880 
when I see an f1 controller and when I
see<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.489> mk2<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.780> I<00:00:36.960> see<00:00:37.230> how<00:00:37.380> they<00:00:37.530> line<00:00:37.739> up

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
see the mk2 and I see how they line up

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.400 
see the mk2 and I see how they line up
side<00:00:38.100> by<00:00:38.129> side<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.660> don't<00:00:39.840> have<00:00:39.930> an<00:00:40.050> s2

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
side by side and then I don't have an s2

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.020 
side by side and then I don't have an s2
here<00:00:40.620> any<00:00:40.739> longer<00:00:40.890> but<00:00:41.340> when<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.550> see<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.790> NASA

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
here any longer but when you see a NASA

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.940 
here any longer but when you see a NASA
too<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.480> it's<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:43.020> same<00:00:43.290> it<00:00:43.530> lines<00:00:43.739> from

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
too and it's the same it lines from

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.200 
too and it's the same it lines from
there<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> there<00:00:46.190> when<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.280> see<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.579> mk2

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
there to there when you see the mk2

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.869 
there to there when you see the mk2
which<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.629> don't<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.110> sort<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.469> x1<00:00:49.920> mk2<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.550> had

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
which I don't the sort of x1 mk2 I had

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.689 
which I don't the sort of x1 mk2 I had
it<00:00:51.030> here<00:00:51.239> tried<00:00:51.870> nope<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.579> it's<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> same

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
it here tried nope and it's the same

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.380 
it here tried nope and it's the same
size<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.239> well<00:00:54.270> too<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.820> so<00:00:56.820> as<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.000> said<00:00:57.180> wat

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
size as well too and so as I said wat

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
size as well too and so as I said wat
does<00:00:57.809> I'd<00:00:58.020> one<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.379> same<00:00:58.530> size<00:00:58.739> with<00:00:58.980> two

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
does I'd one is the same size with two

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.599 
does I'd one is the same size with two
channels<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.760> so<00:01:00.510> logically<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:02.129> makes<00:01:02.190> sense

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
channels and so logically it makes sense

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:03.889 
channels and so logically it makes sense
if<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.850> look<00:01:02.969> at<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.090> behringer<00:01:03.570> line<00:01:03.750> of

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
if you look at the behringer line of

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.560 
if you look at the behringer line of
stuff<00:01:04.170> they<00:01:04.830> have<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.430> tube<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.090> got<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> four

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
stuff they have a tube they got a four

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.690 
stuff they have a tube they got a four
channel<00:01:06.810> job<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.530> an<00:01:07.650> s4<00:01:08.070> but<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.369> only<00:01:08.490> has

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
channel job like an s4 but it's only has

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
channel job like an s4 but it's only has
two<00:01:09.000> things<00:01:09.299> right<00:01:09.570> it's<00:01:10.439> kind<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.590> like<00:01:10.680> an<00:01:10.799> s2

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
two things right it's kind of like an s2

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.550 
two things right it's kind of like an s2
in<00:01:11.310> that<00:01:11.430> sense<00:01:12.170> but<00:01:13.170> they<00:01:13.260> have<00:01:13.380> out<00:01:13.439> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
in that sense but they have out the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.929 
in that sense but they have out the
command<00:01:13.860> modules<00:01:14.280> and<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.430> have<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.610> command

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
command modules and they have a command

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
command modules and they have a command
module<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> has<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.750> jog<00:01:15.990> wheel<00:01:16.020> it's<00:01:16.619> about

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
module that has the jog wheel it's about

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.320 
module that has the jog wheel it's about
this<00:01:16.979> size<00:01:17.220> has<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> jog<00:01:17.759> wheel<00:01:18.000> with<00:01:18.150> all<00:01:18.240> the

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
this size has a jog wheel with all the

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.990 
this size has a jog wheel with all the
transport<00:01:18.780> controls<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.979> my<00:01:20.369> guess<00:01:20.430> is<00:01:20.670> going

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
transport controls so my guess is going

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
transport controls so my guess is going
to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.210> they're<00:01:21.900> gonna<00:01:21.990> make<00:01:22.320> another<00:01:22.770> module

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
to be they're gonna make another module

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
to be they're gonna make another module
to<00:01:24.060> add<00:01:24.210> on<00:01:24.570> with<00:01:24.810> all<00:01:24.990> their<00:01:25.170> other<00:01:25.290> modules

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
to add on with all their other modules

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.609 
to add on with all their other modules
that<00:01:26.240> would<00:01:27.240> make<00:01:27.360> a<00:01:27.390> lot<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> sense<00:01:27.750> it

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
that would make a lot of sense it

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.440 
that would make a lot of sense it
doesn't<00:01:29.220> make<00:01:29.400> a<00:01:29.520> lot<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.820> sense<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
doesn't make a lot of sense to make a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.539 
doesn't make a lot of sense to make a
whole<00:01:30.780> brand-new<00:01:31.320> s4<00:01:31.890> when<00:01:32.130> your<00:01:32.280> whole

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
whole brand-new s4 when your whole

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
whole brand-new s4 when your whole
business<00:01:32.880> plan<00:01:33.420> so<00:01:33.689> far<00:01:33.750> is<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.829> modular

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
business plan so far is going modular

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.370 
business plan so far is going modular
and<00:01:35.549> you're<00:01:36.210> really<00:01:36.509> aiming<00:01:36.689> towards<00:01:37.079> club

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and you're really aiming towards club

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.380 
and you're really aiming towards club
DJs<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> take<00:01:38.790> it<00:01:39.000> an<00:01:39.150> s4<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.079> club<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.390> it's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
DJs and take it an s4 in a club and it's

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.539 
DJs and take it an s4 in a club and it's
too<00:01:42.630> big<00:01:42.950> you<00:01:43.950> always<00:01:44.159> going<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> disconnect

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
too big you always going to disconnect

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
too big you always going to disconnect
your<00:01:44.790> cdjs<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.630> throw<00:01:46.049> that<00:01:46.229> in<00:01:46.380> there<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159

cdjs they have so I can put this on top

cdjs they have so I can put this on top
of<00:02:00.899> everything<00:02:01.140> so<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> way<00:02:02.430> there<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.820> just

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
of everything so that way there I just

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.850 
of everything so that way there I just
plug<00:02:03.210> into<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.479> tail<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.020> back<00:02:04.170> of<00:02:04.439> the

plug into a tail in the back of the

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.430 
plug into a tail in the back of the
mixer<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.090> can<00:02:06.240> run<00:02:06.390> my<00:02:06.420> stuff

as fast as a guy can hook up his thumb

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.050 
as fast as a guy can hook up his thumb
drive<00:02:16.800> almost<00:02:18.020> for<00:02:19.020> the<00:02:19.080> most<00:02:19.230> part<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.850> i

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
drive almost for the most part and i

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.550 
drive almost for the most part and i
should<00:02:21.270> say<00:02:21.450> can<00:02:21.630> you<00:02:21.660> because<00:02:21.990> no<00:02:22.140> i<00:02:22.170> can<00:02:22.380> fire

should say can you because no i can fire
up<00:02:22.680> the<00:02:22.800> laptop<00:02:22.830> like<00:02:23.460> la<00:02:23.820> me<00:02:23.880> from<00:02:24.180> hop<00:02:24.390> it<00:02:24.540> on

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
up the laptop like la me from hop it on

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.290 
up the laptop like la me from hop it on
and<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.740> just<00:02:26.040> plug<00:02:26.280> plug<00:02:26.550> in<00:02:26.790> it<00:02:26.970> away<00:02:27.210> i<00:02:27.240> go

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
and that just plug plug in it away i go

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.990 
and that just plug plug in it away i go
right<00:02:28.490> so<00:02:29.490> if<00:02:30.180> they<00:02:30.390> did<00:02:30.660> make<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> tractor<00:02:32.000> s4

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
right so if they did make a tractor s4

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.750 
right so if they did make a tractor s4
mk2<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:34.230> only<00:02:34.530> thing<00:02:34.680> that's<00:02:34.860> really<00:02:35.220> missing

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
mk2 the only thing that's really missing

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.540 
mk2 the only thing that's really missing
that's<00:02:36.000> even<00:02:36.300> remotely<00:02:36.330> useful<00:02:37.200> I've<00:02:38.070> seen<00:02:38.400> in

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
that's even remotely useful I've seen in

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:41.510 
that's even remotely useful I've seen in
the<00:02:38.610> x1<00:02:39.270> mk2<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.960> that<00:02:40.110> touch<00:02:40.350> strip<00:02:40.680> there's

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
the x1 mk2 is that touch strip there's

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.520 
the x1 mk2 is that touch strip there's
ball<00:02:41.700> touch<00:02:41.940> trip<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:43.020> know<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.380> they

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
ball touch trip so you know if they

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.110 
ball touch trip so you know if they
threw<00:02:43.860> a<00:02:43.920> touch<00:02:44.190> strip<00:02:44.460> in<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:44.820> somewhere

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
threw a touch strip in here somewhere

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.780 
threw a touch strip in here somewhere
that<00:02:45.930> would<00:02:46.020> be<00:02:46.110> kind<00:02:46.320> of<00:02:46.380> cool<00:02:46.550> problem<00:02:47.550> being

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 
that would be kind of cool problem being

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.660 
that would be kind of cool problem being
the<00:02:48.090> s4<00:02:48.660> they<00:02:48.840> have<00:02:49.080> to<00:02:49.290> make<00:02:49.500> it<00:02:49.650> smaller<00:02:49.890> they

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
the s4 they have to make it smaller they

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.720 
the s4 they have to make it smaller they
sent<00:02:50.970> you<00:02:51.060> got<00:02:51.240> to<00:02:51.330> chop<00:02:51.660> that<00:02:51.900> off<00:02:52.490> to<00:02:53.490> make<00:02:53.610> it

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
sent you got to chop that off to make it

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.640 
sent you got to chop that off to make it
fit<00:02:53.970> with<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.210> f1<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.930> all<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.140> stuff<00:02:55.290> and

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
fit with the f1 and all that stuff and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.020 
fit with the f1 and all that stuff and
that's<00:02:56.010> what<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.250> would<00:02:56.370> have<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.790> right

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
that's what they would have to do right

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.260 
that's what they would have to do right
so<00:02:58.020> with<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.920> sacrifice<00:02:59.430> all<00:02:59.850> your<00:03:00.030> effects

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
so with the sacrifice all your effects

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.600 
so with the sacrifice all your effects
controls<00:03:00.630> sure<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:01.890> could<00:03:01.950> because<00:03:02.460> you

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
controls sure they could because you

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.000 
controls sure they could because you
have<00:03:02.820> you<00:03:03.090> know<00:03:03.270> on<00:03:03.510> your<00:03:03.570> ex<00:03:04.440> one<00:03:04.740> for

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
have you know on your ex one for

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.410 
have you know on your ex one for
instance<00:03:05.160> you<00:03:05.490> can<00:03:05.580> do<00:03:05.700> all<00:03:05.730> your<00:03:05.970> effects<00:03:06.240> so

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
instance you can do all your effects so

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.480 
instance you can do all your effects so
you<00:03:06.510> don't<00:03:06.630> need<00:03:06.750> those<00:03:06.930> knobs<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:08.160> effects

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
you don't need those knobs the effects

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.810 
you don't need those knobs the effects
were<00:03:09.270> done<00:03:09.540> perfectly<00:03:10.170> with<00:03:10.320> an<00:03:10.380> XOR<00:03:10.820> that

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820 
were done perfectly with an XOR that

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:13.580 
were done perfectly with an XOR that
being<00:03:12.090> said<00:03:12.390> if<00:03:12.600> you<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:12.750> an<00:03:12.959> ex<00:03:13.140> one<00:03:13.320> already

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
being said if you have an ex one already

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.170 
being said if you have an ex one already
that<00:03:14.100> means<00:03:14.280> you<00:03:14.370> have<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.520> touch<00:03:14.700> strip<00:03:15.000> and

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
that means you have a touch strip and

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.370 
that means you have a touch strip and
you<00:03:15.270> can<00:03:15.420> use<00:03:15.510> that<00:03:15.630> tie<00:03:15.840> trip<00:03:16.140> for<00:03:16.290> your

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
you can use that tie trip for your

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.070 
you can use that tie trip for your
effects<00:03:16.739> so<00:03:17.640> there'd<00:03:18.360> be<00:03:18.450> no<00:03:18.600> sense<00:03:18.870> putting

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
effects so there'd be no sense putting

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.150 
effects so there'd be no sense putting
on<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.590> touch<00:03:19.830> strip<00:03:20.070> here<00:03:21.680> what<00:03:22.680> else<00:03:22.890> they

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
on a touch strip here what else they

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.400 
on a touch strip here what else they
take<00:03:23.400> away<00:03:23.640> your<00:03:24.270> sample<00:03:24.690> buttons<00:03:24.959> because

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
take away your sample buttons because

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.960 
take away your sample buttons because
you<00:03:25.800> don't<00:03:25.950> need<00:03:26.040> them<00:03:26.250> you<00:03:26.400> have<00:03:26.550> one<00:03:26.880> of

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
you don't need them you have one of

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.590 
you don't need them you have one of
those<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:29.370> can<00:03:29.489> use<00:03:29.640> up<00:03:29.850> for<00:03:30.030> your<00:03:30.150> hot<00:03:30.300> cues

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
those you can use up for your hot cues

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.199 
those you can use up for your hot cues
or<00:03:30.690> you<00:03:30.810> can<00:03:30.900> use<00:03:30.930> up<00:03:31.170> for<00:03:31.320> your<00:03:31.410> samples<00:03:31.800> right

you know it's just it's a I don't
understand<00:03:35.040> I<00:03:35.160> don't<00:03:35.190> think<00:03:35.520> they're

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
understand I don't think they're

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:38.290 
understand I don't think they're
actually<00:03:35.700> gonna<00:03:35.940> make<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.360> another<00:03:37.350> one<00:03:37.530> I

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:38.300 
actually gonna make it another one I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:40.130 
actually gonna make it another one I
think<00:03:39.300> they're<00:03:39.390> going<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.570> make<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> modular

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
think they're going to make a modular

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.290 
think they're going to make a modular
one<00:03:40.350> I<00:03:40.530> think<00:03:40.800> he's<00:03:40.920> s<00:03:41.070> fours<00:03:41.430> are<00:03:41.910> great

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
one I think he's s fours are great

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.370 
one I think he's s fours are great

three<00:03:43.620> years<00:03:43.650> they<00:03:44.430> do<00:03:44.489> everything<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:45.660> loop

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
how to use it I'm going to make a video

that little beat there that was done
with<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.739> loop<00:04:16.890> recorder<00:04:17.510> while<00:04:18.510> I<00:04:18.540> was

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
with the loop recorder while I was

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:44.660 
with the loop recorder while I was
running<00:04:18.900> my<00:04:19.290> Gator<00:04:19.530> effects<00:04:42.800> so<00:04:43.800> anyways<00:04:44.190> yeah

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:44.670 
running my Gator effects so anyways yeah

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.390 
running my Gator effects so anyways yeah
you<00:04:44.730> get<00:04:44.940> the<00:04:45.030> point<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:46.620> yeah<00:04:46.770> that's<00:04:46.890> my<00:04:47.040> take

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
highly doubt you have disc informants

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.460 
highly doubt you have disc informants

yeah that's my take on it that's what I

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.680 
yeah that's my take on it that's what I
think<00:05:27.360> buy<00:05:28.260> yourself<00:05:28.560> an<00:05:28.620> s4<00:05:29.420> screen<00:05:30.420> rest<00:05:30.600> of

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
think buy yourself an s4 screen rest of

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.970 
think buy yourself an s4 screen rest of
that<00:05:31.020> man<00:05:31.200> those<00:05:31.410> little<00:05:31.590> modular

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:31.980 
that man those little modular

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:33.770 
that man those little modular
pieces<00:05:32.220> they're<00:05:32.550> all<00:05:32.670> right<00:05:32.880> but<00:05:33.120> not<00:05:33.720> the

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:33.780 
pieces they're all right but not the

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.360 
pieces they're all right but not the
only<00:05:34.020> monitor<00:05:34.500> should<00:05:34.680> I<00:05:34.800> want<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.070> have<00:05:35.190> is

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:35.370 
only monitor should I want to have is

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.810 
only monitor should I want to have is
that<00:05:35.600> maybe<00:05:36.600> one<00:05:37.320> half<00:05:37.530> one<00:05:37.560> with<00:05:38.040> an<00:05:38.160> x1<00:05:38.640> so

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
that maybe one half one with an x1 so

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.100 
that maybe one half one with an x1 so
you<00:05:38.910> can<00:05:39.000> have<00:05:39.120> a<00:05:39.150> touch<00:05:39.450> strip<00:05:39.750> for<00:05:39.990> your

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:40.110 
you can have a touch strip for your

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:42.280 
you can have a touch strip for your
effects<00:05:40.710> because<00:05:41.190> that's<00:05:41.340> pretty<00:05:41.610> cool<00:05:41.820> and

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
effects because that's pretty cool and

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.470 
effects because that's pretty cool and
you're<00:05:43.290> done<00:05:43.470> don't<00:05:44.400> forget<00:05:44.640> i<00:05:44.850> use<00:05:45.210> the<00:05:45.330> dell

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
you're done don't forget i use the dell
