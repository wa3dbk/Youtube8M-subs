art style so much I think they're doing

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:50.289 
art style so much I think they're doing
well<00:01:42.319> with<00:01:42.439> that<00:01:48.189> this<00:01:49.189> is<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> gameplay<00:01:49.970> style

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
well with that this is a gameplay style

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.639 
well with that this is a gameplay style
really<00:01:50.539> unlike<00:01:50.899> anything<00:01:51.140> I've<00:01:51.409> played

00:01:51.639 --> 00:01:51.649 
really unlike anything I've played

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:57.719 
really unlike anything I've played
before<00:01:53.439> game<00:01:54.439> over<00:01:55.569> alright<00:01:56.569> so<00:01:56.780> I<00:01:56.810> got<00:01:56.899> a

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
before game over alright so I got a

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.389 
before game over alright so I got a
decent<00:01:58.729> score<00:01:59.179> I<00:01:59.209> guess<00:01:59.509> high<00:02:00.500> score<00:02:00.829> so<00:02:01.369> it

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
decent score I guess high score so it

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:02.800 
decent score I guess high score so it
keeps<00:02:01.549> track<00:02:01.789> of<00:02:01.819> your<00:02:01.970> own<00:02:02.090> high<00:02:02.239> score<00:02:02.299> I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
keeps track of your own high score I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:04.839 
keeps track of your own high score I
think<00:02:03.140> a<00:02:03.349> game<00:02:03.619> like<00:02:03.799> this<00:02:03.860> especially<00:02:04.340> with

00:02:04.839 --> 00:02:04.849 
think a game like this especially with

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:06.669 
think a game like this especially with
only<00:02:05.090> one<00:02:05.299> mode<00:02:05.539> really<00:02:06.020> needs<00:02:06.229> online

00:02:06.669 --> 00:02:06.679 
only one mode really needs online

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:09.309 
only one mode really needs online
leaderboards<00:02:07.060> so<00:02:08.060> hopefully<00:02:08.539> the<00:02:08.750> developers

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
leaderboards so hopefully the developers

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.970 
leaderboards so hopefully the developers
can<00:02:09.560> add<00:02:09.679> that<00:02:09.910> in<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.090> extra<00:02:11.480> update<00:02:11.860> but<00:02:12.860> for

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980
