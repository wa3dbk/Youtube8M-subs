00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 like i said i don't like anime just 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.589
 I do not like this style and panache 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.840
 I am so hayao miodzaki creates something with 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.940
 something which is difficult to call the world 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.670
 there are no long monologues and and 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.710
 tightened flashbacks but these are just my morals 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.800
 and my mind with which you are not obliged 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 agree pianines losing high 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.420
 notes and summer landscape young these choirs 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.670
 together with parents sent in one 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.410
 of the most unusual and interesting places 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.599
 full of danger and adventure 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.279
 mysterious atmosphere justified 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.950
 waiting for something mysterious 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.440
 unexpected and insanely exciting 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.140
 together with the flying car we enter 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 into the world created surely one of 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.940
 the most talented multipliers 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.440
 modernity hayao miozaki world 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.710
 spirited away 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.770
 the curtain opens the ice is broken gentlemen 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.020
 jurors will not be bored 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.489
 patience is not necessary to stock up on the viewer 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.260
 nothing is required 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.180
 you just turn on the movie and quite 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.000
 unnoticed by the magic of Japanese animation 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:05.430
 Polish eyes ghosts will carry in 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.890
 another brand new brand 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.200
 good and colorful reality reality 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.150
 in which even faceless having found not 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.369
 subject to the power of love in which 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.320
 little girl finds strength not 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.689
 adults are able to find in themselves 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.240
 soft sounds the piano continues 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.430

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.979

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.130

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.840
 conquering good and my all-consuming 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.900
 love spirited away 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.210
 this film is worthy of the highest epithets 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.509
 poetry must speak about him because he 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.430
 the best and the embodiment on the screen 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.619
 harmonious and static and brilliant 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.780
 and genius is felt in everything as 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.329
