the<00:01:37.829> United<00:01:38.070> States<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.310> think<00:01:38.490> around<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
the United States I think around the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.300 
the United States I think around the
world<00:01:38.759> can<00:01:39.060> relate<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.630> and<00:01:39.810> it's<00:01:40.740> that<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
world can relate to it and it's that the

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
world can relate to it and it's that the
family<00:01:41.670> isn't<00:01:41.820> necessarily<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.390> ones<00:01:42.540> you're

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
family isn't necessarily the ones you're

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.210 
family isn't necessarily the ones you're
born<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.049> but<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.320> ones<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.680> you<00:01:43.770> find<00:01:43.979> and
