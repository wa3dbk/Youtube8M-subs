00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.190 
although I was expecting more of a
two-way<00:03:06.250> player<00:03:06.550> I<00:03:06.790> saw<00:03:07.060> his<00:03:07.209> stats<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.810> was

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:08.200 
two-way player I saw his stats I was

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.380 
two-way player I saw his stats I was
hoping<00:03:08.350> the<00:03:08.620> play<00:03:08.830> rack<00:03:09.070> the<00:03:09.610> jump<00:03:09.970> and<00:03:10.209> the

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
hoping the play rack the jump and the

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.030 
hoping the play rack the jump and the
you<00:03:10.630> know<00:03:10.720> all<00:03:10.870> of<00:03:10.900> those<00:03:11.140> awareness<00:03:11.680> features

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
you know all of those awareness features

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.310 
you know all of those awareness features
would<00:03:12.610> really<00:03:12.940> be<00:03:13.090> much<00:03:13.510> better<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:14.020> the<00:03:14.110> past

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
would really be much better in the past

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.380 
would really be much better in the past
defense<00:03:14.830> but<00:03:15.370> really<00:03:15.640> what<00:03:15.730> I<00:03:15.790> realized<00:03:16.209> is

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
defense but really what I realized is

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.630 
defense but really what I realized is
that<00:03:16.450> Polamalu<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.470> linebacker<00:03:18.160> playing

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
that Polamalu is a linebacker playing

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.110 
that Polamalu is a linebacker playing
strong<00:03:18.910> safety<00:03:19.450> that<00:03:20.019> 94<00:03:20.530> speed<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.250> so<00:03:21.910> he's

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
strong safety that 94 speed and so he's

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.880 
strong safety that 94 speed and so he's
going<00:03:22.239> to<00:03:22.330> wreak<00:03:22.510> havoc<00:03:22.930> 15<00:03:23.350> yards<00:03:23.650> or<00:03:23.769> less

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
going to wreak havoc 15 yards or less

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.530 
going to wreak havoc 15 yards or less
from<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.160> line<00:03:24.340> of<00:03:24.459> scrimmage<00:03:24.550> and<00:03:25.030> that's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
from the line of scrimmage and that's

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.780 
from the line of scrimmage and that's
about<00:03:25.720> it<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.170> just<00:03:26.470> don't<00:03:26.650> trust<00:03:26.860> them<00:03:27.190> against

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
about it I just don't trust them against

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.490 
about it I just don't trust them against
face<00:03:28.030> catches<00:03:28.330> any<00:03:28.720> kind<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:28.989> streaks<00:03:29.320> where

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
face catches any kind of streaks where

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.410 
face catches any kind of streaks where
he's<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.680> a<00:03:29.860> deep<00:03:30.040> blue<00:03:30.280> don't<00:03:30.970> use<00:03:31.150> them<00:03:31.300> like

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
he's in a deep blue don't use them like

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.330 
he's in a deep blue don't use them like
that<00:03:31.660> because<00:03:31.840> his<00:03:32.140> strength<00:03:32.470> is<00:03:32.680> playing

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
that because his strength is playing

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.510 
that because his strength is playing
closer<00:03:34.000> to<00:03:34.180> the<00:03:34.239> line<00:03:34.360> of<00:03:34.480> scrimmage
