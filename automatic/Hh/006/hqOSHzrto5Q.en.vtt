if<00:00:22.689> you<00:00:22.930> notice<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.619> radiator<00:00:24.039> fan<00:00:24.310> is<00:00:24.520> noisy

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
if you notice the radiator fan is noisy

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:26.730 
if you notice the radiator fan is noisy
on<00:00:25.119> your<00:00:25.270> car<00:00:25.539> then<00:00:26.080> you'll<00:00:26.199> need<00:00:26.320> to<00:00:26.380> replace

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
on your car then you'll need to replace

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:29.820 
on your car then you'll need to replace
this<00:00:27.070> radiator<00:00:27.730> resistor<00:00:28.390> I<00:00:28.710> bought<00:00:29.710> this

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:29.830 
this radiator resistor I bought this

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.920 
this radiator resistor I bought this
from<00:00:29.949> my<00:00:30.130> local<00:00:30.160> Vauxhall<00:00:30.849> deal<00:00:31.060> up<00:00:31.210> for<00:00:31.480> just

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
from my local Vauxhall deal up for just

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.380 
from my local Vauxhall deal up for just
under<00:00:32.140> 20<00:00:32.439> pounds<00:00:32.650> it<00:00:33.579> took<00:00:33.820> a<00:00:33.910> couple<00:00:34.059> of<00:00:34.210> days

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
under 20 pounds it took a couple of days

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.939 
under 20 pounds it took a couple of days
as<00:00:34.690> it<00:00:34.809> had<00:00:34.900> to<00:00:34.989> come<00:00:35.170> from<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.440> factory<00:00:35.860> in

00:00:35.939 --> 00:00:35.949 
as it had to come from the factory in

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.939 
as it had to come from the factory in
Germany<00:00:36.870> you'll<00:00:37.870> find<00:00:38.199> the<00:00:38.410> resistor<00:00:38.830> is

00:00:38.939 --> 00:00:38.949 
Germany you'll find the resistor is

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.119 
Germany you'll find the resistor is
located<00:00:39.580> on<00:00:39.820> the<00:00:40.180> fan<00:00:40.480> cowling<00:00:41.129> just

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:42.129 
located on the fan cowling just

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.290 
located on the fan cowling just
underneath<00:00:42.430> the<00:00:42.850> header<00:00:43.120> tank<00:00:45.120> wide<00:00:46.120> you

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:46.300 
underneath the header tank wide you

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.990 
underneath the header tank wide you
found<00:00:46.540> it<00:00:46.860> unplug<00:00:47.860> the<00:00:48.010> wiring<00:00:48.400> low<00:00:48.550> by

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
found it unplug the wiring low by

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.740 
found it unplug the wiring low by
lifting<00:00:49.300> this<00:00:49.600> clip<00:00:49.930> quite<00:00:50.769> far<00:00:51.100> away<00:00:51.610> all<00:00:52.480> in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
lifting this clip quite far away all in

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.009 
lifting this clip quite far away all in
one<00:00:52.930> come<00:00:53.199> out<00:00:53.379> and<00:00:53.620> lift<00:00:53.890> it<00:00:53.980> quite<00:00:54.280> high<00:00:55.019> and

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
one come out and lift it quite high and

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.689 
one come out and lift it quite high and
then<00:00:56.170> it<00:00:56.199> unplugged<00:00:58.920> just<00:00:59.920> done<00:01:00.070> that<00:01:00.220> under

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
then it unplugged just done that under

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:06.050 
then it unplugged just done that under
the<00:01:00.850> 8<00:01:01.119> millimeter<00:01:01.570> bolts<00:01:03.299> and<00:01:04.590> remove<00:01:05.590> the

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the 8 millimeter bolts and remove the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:17.640 
the 8 millimeter bolts and remove the
faulty<00:01:07.060> resistor<00:01:07.510> you<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:17.140> not<00:01:17.380> be<00:01:17.500> able<00:01:17.560> to

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
faulty resistor you might not be able to

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.500 
faulty resistor you might not be able to
see<00:01:17.860> damage<00:01:18.250> but<00:01:18.430> on<00:01:18.520> this<00:01:18.640> one<00:01:18.850> it's<00:01:19.090> clearly

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
see damage but on this one it's clearly

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.530 
see damage but on this one it's clearly
visible<00:01:25.380> now<00:01:26.380> take<00:01:26.680> your<00:01:26.890> replacement<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
visible now take your replacement and

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.300 
visible now take your replacement and
put<00:01:28.900> that<00:01:29.020> back<00:01:29.230> into<00:01:29.440> the<00:01:29.620> cowling<00:01:32.310> be

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:33.310 
put that back into the cowling be

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.910 
put that back into the cowling be
careful<00:01:33.730> not<00:01:33.880> to<00:01:33.940> drop<00:01:34.570> the<00:01:34.900> eight<00:01:35.440> millimeter

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
careful not to drop the eight millimeter

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:49.160 
careful not to drop the eight millimeter
bolt

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.030 

and<00:01:50.170> only<00:01:50.530> tighten<00:01:50.920> this<00:01:51.010> up<00:01:52.440> hand<00:01:53.440> tight<00:01:53.740> as

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
and only tighten this up hand tight as

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.350 
and only tighten this up hand tight as
it's<00:01:54.280> screwed<00:01:55.090> into<00:01:55.360> the<00:01:55.510> plastic<00:01:55.930> cowling

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
it's screwed into the plastic cowling

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.990 
it's screwed into the plastic cowling
once<00:01:58.360> you've<00:01:58.480> done<00:01:58.600> that<00:01:59.220> plug<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:00.400> wine<00:02:00.730> loan

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
once you've done that plug the wine loan

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.450 
once you've done that plug the wine loan
back<00:02:01.240> in<00:02:01.420> again<00:02:01.680> making<00:02:02.680> sure<00:02:02.830> that<00:02:03.010> clip

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
back in again making sure that clip

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:15.450 
back in again making sure that clip
clicks<00:02:04.450> down<00:02:04.660> into<00:02:04.900> place<00:02:13.950> now<00:02:14.950> make<00:02:15.130> sure<00:02:15.310> you

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:15.460 
clicks down into place now make sure you

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:20.100 
clicks down into place now make sure you
remove<00:02:15.700> all<00:02:16.060> your<00:02:16.420> tools<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:18.900> get<00:02:19.900> behind

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
remove all your tools and get behind

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:28.320 
remove all your tools and get behind
parts<00:02:23.340> and<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.970> now<00:02:25.120> have<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:26.370> nice<00:02:27.370> quite<00:02:28.209> a

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
parts and you now have a nice quite a

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.370 
parts and you now have a nice quite a
fan<00:02:28.600> of<00:02:28.750> it
