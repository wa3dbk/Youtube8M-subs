00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.570
 hello dear friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.420
 be preparing a delicious pineapple 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.790
 wash to refresh me is almost 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.790
 midnight and the heat is unbearable 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.980
 many people what 

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:43.160
 they write to my channel they ask me 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:46.100
 what would happen if they do not have rum if 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.050
 they could piss off their drinks I go to 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.550
 do the test with this piña colada to 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.190
 see how it goes out I'll be using 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:59.450
 fresh pineapple cubes I'm not going to I'm not going to 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:01.400
 I throw a drink pineapple juice because 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.500
 I do not really have a moment to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.390
 another one that I encouraged myself to prepare it look 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.970
 as the coconut cream is well liquid 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:12.170
 so that's going to make it easier to liquefy 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.830
 everything will be preparing more or 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.869
 minus two glasses of regular size per 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.130
 that we're going to add almost a cup of 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:21.130
 pineapple in squares 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.340
 I want to try to get them out 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.310
 do not 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.509
 for two glasses 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.420
 I add the ice 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:51.050
 I add the piston 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:55.150
 what is missing from the fact of the other this peak 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.150
 of the authentic and be 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.869
 lower it good 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:09.979
 let's do it 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:12.230
 the coconut cream 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:14.810
 for a job are two ounces are two 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.290
 drinks four ounces more or less half 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 from this 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.650
 school a lot because if it does not come out 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.650
 too sweet too 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.810
 a thierry like the pisco 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:32.800
 we put the cap 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.760
 now yes 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.760
 and to liquefy 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.680
 here he would miss the pineapple juice 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do not have any good pineapple juice 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.110
 Let's see 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.140
 to throw more 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.140
 pisco or rondo that have 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.200
 a record 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:37.120
 and 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:37.120
 to freshen up 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.300
 and it's almost midnight it's already a headbutt 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.740
 let's try 

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.750
 to see health 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.460
 kerry 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.590
 they are very good with pisco so now 

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.450
 They know next time when they want 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.600
 Prepare your piña colada and do not have the 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.600
 rum use pisco is great 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.670
 already to serve your bouquets with a cherry 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:23.110
 maraschino so you have better 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.110
 presenting this drink
