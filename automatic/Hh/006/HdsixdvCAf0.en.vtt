00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.890
 hello to all and tuto strong clash 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.599
 today I am going to present you a 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.309
 little explanatory video about 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.860
 different troops and strategies in 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.049
 clash of clan so hang on I 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.010
 will you introduce the archers then 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.859
 unlike what you can 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.840
 think you can enrich yourself 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.250
 really a lot with the archers in 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.869
 using methods and to the letter 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.570
 so you will start by creating 220 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.510
 archer so I remind you archers 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.360
 it's very easy to create it's 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.309
 also this and inexpensive and that's 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.110
 very fast so you will create 220 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.050
 archers you will position yourself at 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.360
 1500 1600 find and you are going to attack 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.360
 an inactive village there are many to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.110
 his troops at this kind of 1 to 1500 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.149
 1600 trophy so do not lose patience 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.039
 so here you are, your village and 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.890
 you attack them by scattering the 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:01.739
 archers from all sides and aiming at 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:07.350
 elections the extractors of the ecir 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:11.700
 the gold mines this is actually you 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.880
 wait for the archers to destroy 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.360
 all the outlines every one every 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.720
 small all the little gold mines and 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:26.310
 you can hope to win between 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:29.030
 I would say 200 miles and 300,000 gold and 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.030
 elixir 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:32.460
 so this is a method that has made its 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.670
 evidence 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.250
 it's very very lucrative you'll 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 so a lot a lot of gold and 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.600
 to elixir very quickly because I 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.479
 remember the archers are troops 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.780
 very easy to create very easy to 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.189

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.030
