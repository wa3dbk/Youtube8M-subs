going to cut it off and put a block in

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.090 
going to cut it off and put a block in
their<00:00:32.870> final<00:00:34.850> look<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> got<00:00:38.070> a

and<00:00:46.230> then<00:00:46.860> it's<00:00:47.070> going<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> plane<00:00:48.140> you<00:00:49.140> have<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
and then it's going to plane you have a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.229 
and then it's going to plane you have a
nice<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.980> surface<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.760> will<00:00:50.910> plane<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
nice little surface that will plane a

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.100 
nice little surface that will plane a
little<00:00:51.629> bit<00:00:51.780> when<00:00:52.020> you're<00:00:52.170> down<00:00:52.410> wending<00:00:54.110> look

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
little bit when you're down wending look

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:02.990 
little bit when you're down wending look
down<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.559> way<00:00:59.030> is<00:01:00.440> very<00:01:01.440> flat<00:01:01.890> in<00:01:02.129> here<00:01:02.640> but

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
down this way is very flat in here but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.100 
down this way is very flat in here but
it<00:01:03.120> does<00:01:03.329> have<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.430> V<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.760> not<00:01:06.119> just<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
it does have a V this is not just a

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.280 
it does have a V this is not just a
planing<00:01:07.380> hull<00:01:07.560> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.869> displacement<00:01:09.869> home

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
planing hull this is a displacement home

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:18.020 
planing hull this is a displacement home
and<00:01:13.189> this<00:01:14.189> part<00:01:15.710> is<00:01:16.710> flat<00:01:17.369> because<00:01:17.610> i'm

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
and this part is flat because i'm

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.320 
and this part is flat because i'm
actually<00:01:18.240> going<00:01:18.570> to<00:01:19.310> glue<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> block<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:21.000> here

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
actually going to glue a block up here

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.570 
actually going to glue a block up here
and<00:01:21.420> final<00:01:21.810> shape<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.380> but<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.939> can<00:01:24.150> see<00:01:24.479> that

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
and final shape it but you can see that

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:32.149 
and final shape it but you can see that
the<00:01:26.580> hull<00:01:27.470> has<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> V<00:01:28.890> to<00:01:29.250> it<00:01:30.049> and<00:01:31.049> it's<00:01:31.920> got<00:01:32.100> a

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
the hull has a V to it and it's got a

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.640 
the hull has a V to it and it's got a
little<00:01:32.400> bit<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.640> rocker<00:01:32.909> remember<00:01:33.840> over<00:01:34.229> here

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
little bit of rocker remember over here

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.700 
little bit of rocker remember over here
that's<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.970> have<00:01:36.420> added<00:01:36.869> wood<00:01:37.320> to<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
that's going to have added wood to it

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.340 
that's going to have added wood to it
it's<00:01:37.920> flat<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.820> was<00:01:39.079> going<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.140> add<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
it's flat because I was going to add a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.679 
it's flat because I was going to add a
piece<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.310> then<00:01:41.430> final<00:01:41.820> shape<00:01:42.090> you<00:01:42.570> can

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
piece to it and then final shape you can

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.100 
piece to it and then final shape you can
still<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.200> it's<00:01:43.350> got<00:01:43.500> some<00:01:43.710> rocker<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110 
still see it's got some rocker to it

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.569 
still see it's got some rocker to it
just<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.229> little<00:01:46.259> bit<00:01:46.850> so<00:01:47.850> be<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.060> great<00:01:48.450> fast

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579 
just a little bit so be a great fast

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:56.420 
just a little bit so be a great fast
boat<00:01:51.079> racing<00:01:52.310> and<00:01:54.740> you're<00:01:55.740> not<00:01:55.860> going<00:01:56.130> to<00:01:56.189> pull

any you're not going to have that low

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
any you're not going to have that low
pressure<00:02:01.020> zone<00:02:01.229> behind<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.979> where<00:02:02.130> someone

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
pressure zone behind you where someone

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.340 
pressure zone behind you where someone
can<00:02:02.670> draft<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.329> this<00:02:03.659> thing<00:02:03.930> is<00:02:04.049> going<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> be

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
can draft you this thing is going to be

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.170 
can draft you this thing is going to be
clean<00:02:04.710> through<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> water<00:02:05.369> so<00:02:05.939> more<00:02:06.840> to<00:02:06.960> come
