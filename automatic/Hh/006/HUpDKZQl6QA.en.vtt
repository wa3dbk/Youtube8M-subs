00:00:36.750 --> 00:01:03.100 
matte varnish with through an airbrush
and<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.890> we'll<00:00:38.160> see<00:00:38.340> how<00:00:38.700> it<00:00:39.059> goes<00:00:39.120> on

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:03.110 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.150 

all<00:01:04.110> right<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.410> here<00:01:04.589> are<00:01:04.620> the<00:01:04.710> two<00:01:04.830> emigrants

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:05.160 
all right so here are the two emigrants

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.719 
all right so here are the two emigrants
all<00:01:05.370> painted<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:07.130> it's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.190> little<00:01:08.310> hard<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
all painted up and it's a little hard to

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.140 
all painted up and it's a little hard to
tell<00:01:08.910> what<00:01:09.240> happened<00:01:09.360> but<00:01:09.870> um<00:01:10.400> the<00:01:11.400> testers

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
tell what happened but um the testers

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
tell what happened but um the testers
went<00:01:12.450> on<00:01:12.540> pretty<00:01:12.900> darn<00:01:13.080> thick<00:01:13.440> um<00:01:14.360> and<00:01:15.360> the

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
went on pretty darn thick um and the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.930 
went on pretty darn thick um and the
polyurethane<00:01:16.530> matte<00:01:16.920> varnish<00:01:17.100> Ashley<00:01:17.729> is

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
polyurethane matte varnish Ashley is

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.510 
polyurethane matte varnish Ashley is
SuperDuper<00:01:18.900> thin<00:01:19.380> which<00:01:20.070> actually<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
SuperDuper thin which actually is

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.010 
SuperDuper thin which actually is
probably<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:20.850> good<00:01:21.030> thing<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.690> can<00:01:21.810> really

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
probably a good thing so you can really

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.920 
probably a good thing so you can really
control<00:01:22.200> like<00:01:22.970> how<00:01:23.970> much<00:01:24.150> you<00:01:24.360> can<00:01:24.479> tell<00:01:24.690> how

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
control like how much you can tell how

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.109 
control like how much you can tell how
much<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.560> you<00:01:25.770> lose<00:01:25.950> any<00:01:26.130> kind<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.580> detail<00:01:27.090> on

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
much if you lose any kind of detail on

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.219 
much if you lose any kind of detail on
the<00:01:27.270> model<00:01:27.510> or<00:01:27.600> not<00:01:29.149> the<00:01:30.149> little<00:01:30.570> bit<00:01:30.810> it

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
the model or not the little bit it

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.960 
the model or not the little bit it
almost<00:01:31.440> kind<00:01:31.619> of<00:01:31.710> filled<00:01:32.040> in<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.490> little<00:01:32.850> bit

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
almost kind of filled in a little bit

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.359 
almost kind of filled in a little bit
like<00:01:33.119> in<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.270> teeth<00:01:33.540> area<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.830> as<00:01:34.979> that<00:01:35.250> this

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
like in the teeth area or as that this

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.700 
like in the teeth area or as that this
one<00:01:35.580> you<00:01:35.880> can<00:01:36.000> barely<00:01:36.300> tell<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.540> even<00:01:36.960> there's

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
one you can barely tell it even there's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.090 
one you can barely tell it even there's
even<00:01:37.920> a<00:01:37.979> coat<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> there<00:01:38.399> so<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.979> with<00:01:40.979> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
even a coat on there so I think with the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.320 
even a coat on there so I think with the
Vallejo<00:01:41.490> actually<00:01:41.850> gives<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.119> lot<00:01:42.270> more

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.330 
Vallejo actually gives you a lot more

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.609 
Vallejo actually gives you a lot more
control<00:01:42.720> especially<00:01:42.930> since<00:01:43.380> you're<00:01:43.470> putting

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
control especially since you're putting

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.710 
control especially since you're putting
it<00:01:43.710> through<00:01:43.770> an<00:01:43.890> airbrush<00:01:44.250> I<00:01:44.550> think<00:01:45.330> actually

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it through an airbrush I think actually

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.350 
it through an airbrush I think actually
like<00:01:46.050> two<00:01:46.200> or<00:01:46.350> three<00:01:46.530> coats<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.860> this<00:01:47.210> would<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
like two or three coats of this would be

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
like two or three coats of this would be
just<00:01:48.630> as<00:01:48.840> sturdy<00:01:49.110> and<00:01:49.410> you'd<00:01:49.560> have<00:01:49.649> a<00:01:49.710> lot<00:01:49.979> more

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
just as sturdy and you'd have a lot more

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.940 
just as sturdy and you'd have a lot more
control<00:01:51.259> probably<00:01:52.259> also<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:52.920> a

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
control probably also you get like a

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.710 
control probably also you get like a
little<00:01:53.070> bit<00:01:53.250> more<00:01:53.490> more<00:01:54.149> bang<00:01:54.330> for<00:01:54.360> your<00:01:54.539> buck

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
little bit more more bang for your buck

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:55.880 
little bit more more bang for your buck
with<00:01:54.780> this<00:01:55.080> one<00:01:55.229> because<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> pretty

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
with this one because you get a pretty

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.400 
with this one because you get a pretty
nice<00:01:56.039> sized<00:01:56.550> bottle<00:01:57.030> and<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.899> only<00:01:58.110> put<00:01:58.320> in

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:58.410 
nice sized bottle and like I only put in

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:00.199 
nice sized bottle and like I only put in
two<00:01:58.740> drops<00:01:58.979> my<00:01:59.250> airbrush<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.729> didn't<00:01:59.940> even<00:02:00.030> use

00:02:00.199 --> 00:02:00.209 
two drops my airbrush I didn't even use

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:02.240 
two drops my airbrush I didn't even use
all<00:02:00.330> that<00:02:00.450> much<00:02:00.660> up<00:02:01.039> whereas<00:02:02.039> what<00:02:02.190> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
all that much up whereas what the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.980 
all that much up whereas what the
testers<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.060> get<00:02:03.179> just<00:02:03.539> a<00:02:03.630> little<00:02:03.840> tiny

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
testers can you get just a little tiny

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.590 
testers can you get just a little tiny
cans<00:02:04.289> and<00:02:04.759> they're<00:02:05.759> just<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:06.000> shake<00:02:06.179> can<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
cans and they're just a shake can so you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.609 
cans and they're just a shake can so you
don't<00:02:06.660> get<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:06.899> much<00:02:07.020> control<00:02:07.350> and<00:02:07.500> you<00:02:07.590> have

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
don't get that much control and you have

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.340 
don't get that much control and you have
to<00:02:07.800> wait<00:02:07.950> for<00:02:08.130> a<00:02:08.160> nice<00:02:08.310> day<00:02:08.520> to<00:02:08.580> spray<00:02:08.940> so<00:02:09.539> they

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
to wait for a nice day to spray so they

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.530 
to wait for a nice day to spray so they
both<00:02:10.560> definitely<00:02:10.979> have<00:02:11.310> their<00:02:12.180> their

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
both definitely have their their

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.160 
both definitely have their their
situations<00:02:13.230> they're<00:02:13.770> both<00:02:13.860> very<00:02:14.130> good<00:02:15.170> so

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
situations they're both very good so

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.570 
situations they're both very good so
yeah<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.349> guess<00:02:16.590> it<00:02:16.740> all<00:02:16.830> depends<00:02:17.250> on<00:02:17.310> what<00:02:17.550> kind

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
yeah I guess it all depends on what kind

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.059
