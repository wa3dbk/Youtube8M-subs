a<00:00:24.060> disappointing<00:00:24.600> performance<00:00:25.019> I<00:00:25.109> thought<00:00:25.380> on

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
a disappointing performance I thought on

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.589 
a disappointing performance I thought on
the<00:00:26.039> road<00:00:26.250> last<00:00:26.490> week<00:00:26.760> in<00:00:26.939> Carolina<00:00:27.390> but

the road last week in Carolina but
against<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.930> good<00:00:28.050> defense<00:00:28.109> in<00:00:28.590> Carolina<00:00:29.039> so

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
against a good defense in Carolina so

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.209 
against a good defense in Carolina so
not<00:00:29.429> totally<00:00:29.849> unexpected<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.230> Lions<00:00:31.650> know

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
not totally unexpected the Lions know

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.590 
not totally unexpected the Lions know
which<00:00:32.399> team<00:00:32.640> are<00:00:32.759> there<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.090> team<00:00:33.270> we<00:00:33.390> saw<00:00:33.570> a

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
which team are there the team we saw a

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.030 
which team are there the team we saw a
week<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.110> didn't<00:00:34.559> turn<00:00:34.649> the<00:00:34.710> ball<00:00:34.860> over

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
week one that didn't turn the ball over

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.370 
week one that didn't turn the ball over
that<00:00:35.489> defense<00:00:35.880> was<00:00:36.030> opportunistic<00:00:36.630> with<00:00:37.350> a

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
that defense was opportunistic with a

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.410 
that defense was opportunistic with a
team<00:00:37.680> to<00:00:37.860> team<00:00:38.010> in<00:00:38.160> week<00:00:38.309> two<00:00:38.579> that<00:00:39.059> sort<00:00:39.360> of

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
team to team in week two that sort of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.690 
team to team in week two that sort of
looked<00:00:39.570> like<00:00:39.629> the<00:00:39.870> old<00:00:40.110> lion<00:00:40.320> so<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.680> think<00:00:41.100> you

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
looked like the old lion so I think you

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.130 
looked like the old lion so I think you
know<00:00:41.790> we'll<00:00:41.969> see<00:00:42.000> this<00:00:42.390> week<00:00:42.629> I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:42.870> it's<00:00:43.079> a

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
know we'll see this week I think it's a

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.880 
know we'll see this week I think it's a
good<00:00:43.290> matchup<00:00:43.559> for<00:00:43.829> them<00:00:44.100> in<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:44.940> instances

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
good matchup for them in some instances

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.080 
good matchup for them in some instances
obviously<00:00:46.890> like<00:00:47.039> every<00:00:47.340> week<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.760> know

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
obviously like every week you know

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.459 
obviously like every week you know
there's<00:00:48.390> no<00:00:48.510> one<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.750> can<00:00:48.870> cover<00:00:49.050> Calvin

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
there's no one that can cover Calvin

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.529 
there's no one that can cover Calvin
Johnson<00:00:49.829> on<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.039> opposing<00:00:50.280> team<00:00:50.700> not<00:00:51.239> Sam

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
Johnson on the opposing team not Sam

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.049 
Johnson on the opposing team not Sam
Shields<00:00:51.809> certainly<00:00:52.350> not<00:00:52.500> Tramon<00:00:52.829> Williams

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
but can another player step up opposite

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.310 
but can another player step up opposite
him<00:00:56.160> and<00:00:56.399> put<00:00:56.879> up<00:00:56.969> some<00:00:57.000> numbers<00:00:57.329> they<00:00:57.960> did<00:00:58.199> in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
times able to do that last week you know

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.910 
times able to do that last week you know
ken<00:01:24.000> Detroit<00:01:24.509> come<00:01:24.780> in<00:01:24.960> with<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.500> sense<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
ken Detroit come in with a sense of

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.340 
ken Detroit come in with a sense of
urgency<00:01:26.070> division<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:27.509> get<00:01:27.930> after<00:01:28.080> the

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
urgency division game and get after the

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.200 
urgency division game and get after the
quarterback<00:01:28.380> because<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.670> know<00:01:29.790> I<00:01:29.820> think<00:01:30.030> why

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
quarterback because you know I think why

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.060 
quarterback because you know I think why
I<00:01:30.240> said<00:01:30.570> no<00:01:30.720> one<00:01:30.840> can<00:01:30.990> guard<00:01:31.200> Calvin<00:01:31.590> Johnson

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
I said no one can guard Calvin Johnson

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.010 
I said no one can guard Calvin Johnson
on<00:01:32.220> the<00:01:32.400> Packers<00:01:32.820> I<00:01:33.030> certainly<00:01:33.720> think<00:01:33.900> that

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
on the Packers I certainly think that

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.560 
on the Packers I certainly think that
Detroit<00:01:34.500> secondary<00:01:35.070> which<00:01:35.280> I<00:01:35.400> still<00:01:35.640> think<00:01:35.909> is

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
Detroit secondary which I still think is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.600 
Detroit secondary which I still think is
the<00:01:36.689> weakness<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:37.200> their<00:01:37.320> team<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:38.280> know<00:01:38.400> can

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
the weakness of their team you know can

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.969

he does on the road it just seems to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.630 
he does on the road it just seems to

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
two turnovers obviously always a huge

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.950 
two turnovers obviously always a huge
issue<00:02:04.920> for<00:02:05.070> him<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.610> something<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.840> I<00:02:06.899> think

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
issue for him and something that I think

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960 
issue for him and something that I think
was<00:02:07.799> one<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.399> things<00:02:08.520> that's<00:02:08.700> going<00:02:08.849> to

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
was one of the things that's going to

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.089 
was one of the things that's going to
hold<00:02:09.060> his<00:02:09.270> team<00:02:09.479> hostage<00:02:09.959> until<00:02:10.200> he<00:02:10.920> develops

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
hold his team hostage until he develops

consistency in that area

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
consistency in that area
the<00:02:13.560> Packers<00:02:14.040> look<00:02:14.640> they<00:02:14.790> have<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.030> get<00:02:15.270> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
the Packers look they have to get the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.390 
the Packers look they have to get the
running<00:02:15.660> game<00:02:15.810> going<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.560> me<00:02:16.710> they<00:02:16.890> have<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
running game going to me they have to

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.940 
running game going to me they have to
get<00:02:17.580> Eddie<00:02:17.820> Lacy<00:02:18.120> going<00:02:18.630> early<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.260> try<00:02:19.830> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
get Eddie Lacy going early to try to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.670 
get Eddie Lacy going early to try to
curtail<00:02:20.400> that<00:02:20.460> pass<00:02:20.940> rush<00:02:21.300> of<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.200> lines<00:02:22.410> that

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
curtail that pass rush of the lines that

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.920 
curtail that pass rush of the lines that
the<00:02:22.860> lines<00:02:23.070> are<00:02:23.310> able<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.060> get<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> Packers<00:02:24.810> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
the lines are able to get the Packers to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.200 
the lines are able to get the Packers to
be<00:02:25.050> predictable<00:02:25.680> into<00:02:26.220> predictable<00:02:26.760> down<00:02:26.970> and

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
be predictable into predictable down and

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.490 
be predictable into predictable down and
distances<00:02:27.720> where<00:02:27.900> they<00:02:28.020> pretty<00:02:28.260> much<00:02:28.350> know

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
distances where they pretty much know

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.310 
distances where they pretty much know
they're<00:02:29.250> going<00:02:29.430> to<00:02:29.550> pass<00:02:29.820> I<00:02:30.090> think<00:02:30.840> that's<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
they're going to pass I think that's the

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.170 
they're going to pass I think that's the
only<00:02:31.710> way<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:32.010> Packers<00:02:32.430> can<00:02:32.580> have<00:02:32.700> trouble<00:02:33.090> in

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
only way the Packers can have trouble in

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
only way the Packers can have trouble in
this<00:02:33.300> one<00:02:33.360> Lacey's<00:02:34.290> had<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.440> very<00:02:34.740> slow<00:02:35.040> first

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
this one Lacey's had a very slow first

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:36.860 
this one Lacey's had a very slow first
two<00:02:35.580> weeks<00:02:35.850> but<00:02:36.360> he<00:02:36.450> might<00:02:36.600> have<00:02:36.750> played

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
two weeks but he might have played

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.870 
two weeks but he might have played
against<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.260> best<00:02:37.500> two<00:02:37.740> rushing<00:02:38.160> defenses<00:02:38.730> in

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
against the best two rushing defenses in

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.730 
against the best two rushing defenses in
the<00:02:38.940> NFL<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.600> first<00:02:39.810> two<00:02:39.990> weeks<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.320> be<00:02:40.440> fair

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
the NFL the first two weeks to be fair

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.250 
the NFL the first two weeks to be fair
so<00:02:41.340> I<00:02:41.370> expect<00:02:41.790> an<00:02:41.880> emphasis<00:02:42.420> to<00:02:42.810> get<00:02:43.020> Eddie

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
so I expect an emphasis to get Eddie

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.650 
so I expect an emphasis to get Eddie
Lacy<00:02:43.560> the<00:02:43.800> football<00:02:44.160> early<00:02:44.580> and<00:02:44.730> often<00:02:44.970> to

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
Lacy the football early and often to

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.230 
Lacy the football early and often to
free<00:02:45.930> Rogers<00:02:46.380> up<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:47.130> do<00:02:47.280> what<00:02:47.430> he<00:02:47.520> does<00:02:47.730> all

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
free Rogers up to do what he does all

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.020 
free Rogers up to do what he does all
right<00:02:48.480> hitting<00:02:48.870> his<00:02:49.170> receivers<00:02:49.920> on<00:02:50.880> the

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
right hitting his receivers on the

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.390 
right hitting his receivers on the
outside<00:02:51.450> something<00:02:52.350> he<00:02:52.590> may<00:02:52.740> be<00:02:52.800> the<00:02:53.070> best<00:02:53.220> in

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
outside something he may be the best in

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.360 
outside something he may be the best in
the<00:02:53.430> NFL<00:02:53.880> at<00:02:54.300> doing<00:02:54.870> certainly<00:02:55.350> I<00:02:55.500> think<00:02:55.980> these

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
the NFL at doing certainly I think these

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:57.650 
the NFL at doing certainly I think these
two<00:02:56.580> teams<00:02:56.820> when<00:02:57.060> you're<00:02:57.180> talking<00:02:57.510> about

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
two teams when you're talking about

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.770 
two teams when you're talking about
playing<00:02:58.050> at<00:02:58.590> Detroit<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> you<00:03:00.150> talk<00:03:00.360> about<00:03:00.390> to

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
playing at Detroit and you talk about to

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.420 
playing at Detroit and you talk about to
me<00:03:00.960> the<00:03:01.200> struggles<00:03:01.770> of<00:03:01.860> that<00:03:02.040> green<00:03:02.250> bay

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
me the struggles of that green bay

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.730 
me the struggles of that green bay
offensive<00:03:03.060> line<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.600> think<00:03:04.200> these<00:03:04.320> two<00:03:04.500> teams

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
offensive line I think these two teams

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.950 
offensive line I think these two teams
are<00:03:04.890> pretty<00:03:05.070> close<00:03:05.460> to<00:03:05.670> even<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.120> this<00:03:06.270> one<00:03:06.450> all

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
are pretty close to even in this one all

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.680 
are pretty close to even in this one all
right<00:03:07.110> it's<00:03:07.800> just<00:03:07.980> a<00:03:08.070> matter<00:03:08.100> comes<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.850> your

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
right it's just a matter comes to your

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.940 
right it's just a matter comes to your
really<00:03:10.020> splitting<00:03:10.350> hairs<00:03:10.470> when<00:03:10.830> you're

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
really splitting hairs when you're

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.470 
really splitting hairs when you're
trying<00:03:11.070> to<00:03:11.190> predict<00:03:11.520> a<00:03:11.610> game<00:03:11.790> like<00:03:11.940> this<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.330> my

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
trying to predict a game like this in my

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.300 
trying to predict a game like this in my
mind<00:03:12.720> again<00:03:13.140> predominantly<00:03:13.950> because<00:03:14.070> the

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
mind again predominantly because the

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.760 
mind again predominantly because the
game<00:03:14.490> is<00:03:14.640> at<00:03:14.820> Detroit<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.020> because<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.620> the

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
game is at Detroit and because of the

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.640 
game is at Detroit and because of the
injuries<00:03:17.250> for<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:17.970> Packers<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:19.290> one<00:03:19.470> I

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
injuries for the Packers in this one I

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.290
