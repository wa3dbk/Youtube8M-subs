00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
attach that to my trigger as well now

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.580 
attach that to my trigger as well now
inside<00:02:17.000> our<00:02:17.060> blaster<00:02:17.570> handle<00:02:17.930> we're<00:02:18.290> going<00:02:18.500> to

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
inside our blaster handle we're going to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.570 
inside our blaster handle we're going to
get<00:02:18.680> our<00:02:18.830> counter<00:02:19.280> and<00:02:21.280> we're<00:02:22.280> going<00:02:22.550> to

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
get our counter and we're going to

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.940 
get our counter and we're going to
attach<00:02:22.760> our<00:02:23.210> trigger<00:02:23.540> into<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.230> input<00:02:24.650> of<00:02:24.830> the

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
attach our trigger into the input of the

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.260 
attach our trigger into the input of the
counter<00:02:27.430> then<00:02:28.430> depending<00:02:28.940> on<00:02:29.030> how<00:02:29.150> much

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:29.270 
counter then depending on how much

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.420 
counter then depending on how much
bullets<00:02:29.660> you<00:02:29.810> want<00:02:30.020> depends<00:02:31.010> on<00:02:31.100> the<00:02:31.190> target

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
bullets you want depends on the target

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.210 
bullets you want depends on the target
count<00:02:31.850> so<00:02:32.750> I'm<00:02:32.870> going<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.200> ten<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:34.070> we

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
count so I'm going to have ten then we

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.940 
count so I'm going to have ten then we
want<00:02:34.400> to<00:02:34.490> invert<00:02:34.970> it<00:02:35.680> then<00:02:36.680> we're<00:02:36.800> going<00:02:36.920> to

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
want to invert it then we're going to

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:39.340 
want to invert it then we're going to
take<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.250> output<00:02:37.660> and<00:02:38.660> put<00:02:38.840> it<00:02:38.960> into<00:02:39.260> the

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350 
take the output and put it into the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.010 
take the output and put it into the
activation<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.370> the<00:02:40.550> microchip<00:02:40.970> with<00:02:41.870> the

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020 
activation of the microchip with the

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:48.700 
activation of the microchip with the
emitter<00:02:42.290> in<00:02:42.530> it<00:02:46.750> now<00:02:47.750> we<00:02:47.810> need<00:02:48.140> to<00:02:48.290> make<00:02:48.470> our

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:48.710 
emitter in it now we need to make our

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:52.630 
emitter in it now we need to make our
reload<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.970> our<00:02:50.300> ammo<00:02:50.990> pickups<00:02:51.380> so<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:52.400> need

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
reload so our ammo pickups so you need

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.400 
reload so our ammo pickups so you need
something<00:02:52.880> that<00:02:53.120> he<00:02:53.300> has<00:02:53.540> no<00:02:53.780> collision<00:02:54.260> so

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:54.410 
something that he has no collision so

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
something that he has no collision so
that<00:02:54.530> you<00:02:54.590> can<00:02:54.739> walk<00:02:54.890> through<00:02:54.920> it

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that you can walk through it

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.750 
that you can walk through it
click<00:02:56.000> panels<00:02:56.360> good<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.660> this<00:02:56.780> and<00:02:57.760> then

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
click panels good for this and then

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.890 
click panels good for this and then
we're<00:02:58.970> going<00:02:59.000> to<00:02:59.239> put<00:02:59.420> a<00:02:59.450> microchip<00:02:59.900> on<00:03:00.170> top

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
we're going to put a microchip on top

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.979 
we're going to put a microchip on top
first<00:03:02.900> thing<00:03:03.200> we<00:03:03.320> want<00:03:03.560> is<00:03:03.680> an<00:03:03.830> impact<00:03:04.280> sensor

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
first thing we want is an impact sensor

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:07.449 
first thing we want is an impact sensor
this<00:03:05.989> impact<00:03:06.440> sensor<00:03:06.860> should<00:03:07.070> be<00:03:07.220> set<00:03:07.430> to

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
this impact sensor should be set to

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.230 
powerup we're going to move down the
arrow<00:05:33.890> pack<00:05:34.220> so<00:05:34.430> we<00:05:34.460> can<00:05:34.610> actually<00:05:34.850> pick<00:05:35.000> it<00:05:35.120> up

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240 
arrow pack so we can actually pick it up

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.330 
arrow pack so we can actually pick it up
you'll<00:05:36.050> need<00:05:36.230> to<00:05:36.380> make<00:05:36.560> some<00:05:36.740> sort<00:05:36.890> of<00:05:37.010> emitter

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
you'll need to make some sort of emitter

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:41.860 
you'll need to make some sort of emitter
for<00:05:37.880> these<00:05:38.120> ammo<00:05:38.450> packs<00:05:39.880> and<00:05:40.880> I'm<00:05:41.450> going<00:05:41.840> to

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
for these ammo packs and I'm going to

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.680 
for these ammo packs and I'm going to
have<00:05:42.170> it<00:05:42.350> come<00:05:42.590> out<00:05:42.680> of<00:05:42.740> here<00:05:46.210> now<00:05:47.210> when<00:05:47.390> I<00:05:47.420> pick

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:47.690 
have it come out of here now when I pick

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:49.480 
have it come out of here now when I pick
up<00:05:47.750> my<00:05:47.810> gun<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.200> can<00:05:48.320> see<00:05:48.470> I've<00:05:48.620> got<00:05:48.800> 10<00:05:49.100> on<00:05:49.340> my

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
up my gun you can see I've got 10 on my

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.480 
up my gun you can see I've got 10 on my
ammo<00:05:49.820> some<00:05:50.630> fire<00:05:50.840> a<00:05:50.870> few<00:05:51.170> off<00:05:51.350> and<00:05:52.100> I<00:05:52.160> can<00:05:52.340> walk

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
ammo some fire a few off and I can walk

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.610 
ammo some fire a few off and I can walk
into<00:05:52.760> the<00:05:53.150> ammo<00:05:53.690> pack<00:05:53.930> and<00:05:54.110> now<00:05:54.170> I<00:05:54.200> have<00:05:54.410> 10

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
into the ammo pack and now I have 10

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:57.610 
into the ammo pack and now I have 10
again<00:05:55.510> there<00:05:56.510> are<00:05:56.630> other<00:05:56.810> ways<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.200> doing<00:05:57.320> this

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
again there are other ways of doing this

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:00.880 
again there are other ways of doing this
there<00:05:58.250> is<00:05:58.580> a<00:05:58.850> non<00:05:59.570> ammo<00:05:59.900> pack<00:06:00.170> requirement<00:06:00.740> one

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:00.890 
there is a non ammo pack requirement one

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:04.210 
there is a non ammo pack requirement one
so<00:06:01.820> instead<00:06:02.600> you<00:06:02.810> just<00:06:03.080> want<00:06:03.320> a<00:06:03.470> short<00:06:04.040> amount

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:04.220 
so instead you just want a short amount

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.620 
so instead you just want a short amount
of<00:06:04.340> time<00:06:04.400> before<00:06:04.940> the<00:06:05.180> gun<00:06:05.360> completely

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:05.630 
of time before the gun completely

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:07.120 
of time before the gun completely
reloads<00:06:06.200> so<00:06:06.440> you<00:06:06.530> don't<00:06:06.680> have<00:06:06.770> to<00:06:06.890> pick<00:06:07.040> up

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:07.130 
reloads so you don't have to pick up

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:09.640 
reloads so you don't have to pick up
ammo<00:06:07.460> you<00:06:08.120> can<00:06:08.270> do<00:06:08.420> this<00:06:08.630> by<00:06:08.960> getting<00:06:09.290> rid<00:06:09.620> of

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
ammo you can do this by getting rid of

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.130 
ammo you can do this by getting rid of
the<00:06:10.220> ammo<00:06:10.460> pack<00:06:10.760> itself<00:06:11.180> and<00:06:11.420> the<00:06:12.110> impact

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.140 
the ammo pack itself and the impact

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:17.590 
the ammo pack itself and the impact
sensor<00:06:13.030> now<00:06:14.030> add<00:06:14.360> in<00:06:14.570> instead<00:06:15.080> a<00:06:15.380> timer<00:06:16.600> with

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:17.600 
sensor now add in instead a timer with

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.270 
sensor now add in instead a timer with
however<00:06:18.020> many<00:06:18.260> seconds<00:06:18.620> it<00:06:18.740> is<00:06:18.770> before<00:06:19.160> you

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.280 
however many seconds it is before you

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:21.940 
however many seconds it is before you
reload<00:06:19.670> want<00:06:20.240> it<00:06:20.330> to<00:06:20.390> be<00:06:20.540> a<00:06:20.570> count<00:06:20.960> up<00:06:21.140> timer<00:06:21.530> so

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
reload want it to be a count up timer so

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.550 
reload want it to be a count up timer so
I'm<00:06:22.070> going<00:06:22.250> to<00:06:22.280> use<00:06:22.490> two<00:06:22.790> seconds<00:06:23.440> then<00:06:24.440> we

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
I'm going to use two seconds then we

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.340 
I'm going to use two seconds then we
want<00:06:24.740> the<00:06:24.800> output<00:06:25.120> into<00:06:26.120> the<00:06:26.300> reset<00:06:26.810> of<00:06:27.080> the

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
want the output into the reset of the

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.190 
want the output into the reset of the
counter<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.950> the<00:06:28.850> reset<00:06:29.240> of<00:06:29.270> this<00:06:29.510> timer<00:06:29.810> so

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.200 
counter and the reset of this timer so

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.900 
counter and the reset of this timer so
itself<00:06:30.620> then<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:31.640> not<00:06:32.000> gate<00:06:32.530> into<00:06:33.530> the<00:06:33.910> input

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:34.910 
itself then the not gate into the input

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:37.240 
itself then the not gate into the input
of<00:06:34.940> the<00:06:35.150> timer<00:06:35.390> now<00:06:36.380> you<00:06:36.440> just<00:06:36.830> have<00:06:36.980> a<00:06:37.040> two

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.250 
of the timer now you just have a two

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:43.960 
of the timer now you just have a two
second<00:06:37.640> delay<00:06:37.670> before<00:06:38.030> you<00:06:38.270> reload<00:06:42.970> well

00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:43.970 
second delay before you reload well

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:46.210 
second delay before you reload well
