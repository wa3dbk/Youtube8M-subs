with Just Cause 2 and visit my honest

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.170 
with Just Cause 2 and visit my honest
opinion<00:00:31.050> I<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.740> melee<00:00:32.010> combat<00:00:32.550> system

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
opinion I think the melee combat system

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.110 
opinion I think the melee combat system
sucked<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.899> lot<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.350> it<00:00:34.559> was<00:00:34.710> pretty<00:00:35.040> bad<00:00:35.430> for

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
sucked a lot like it was pretty bad for

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.639 
sucked a lot like it was pretty bad for
example<00:00:36.570> whenever<00:00:36.750> you<00:00:36.960> was<00:00:37.079> close<00:00:37.350> to<00:00:37.559> an

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
example whenever you was close to an

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.530 
example whenever you was close to an
enemy<00:00:37.829> and<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.430> wanted<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.790> hit<00:00:39.030> them<00:00:39.329> you

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
enemy and you wanted to hit them you

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
enemy and you wanted to hit them you
never<00:00:39.930> had<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.500> ability<00:00:40.770> to<00:00:41.250> use<00:00:41.460> your<00:00:41.489> fists

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
never had that ability to use your fists

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.729 
never had that ability to use your fists
instead<00:00:42.329> she<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:42.989> some<00:00:43.200> sort<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.469> thing<00:00:43.710> that

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
instead she has some sort of thing that

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.740 
instead she has some sort of thing that
was<00:00:44.160> like<00:00:44.309> attached<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.940> grappling<00:00:45.570> hook

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
was like attached to your grappling hook

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.750 
was like attached to your grappling hook
and<00:00:46.050> you<00:00:46.200> just<00:00:46.410> pretty<00:00:46.739> much<00:00:47.100> whacked<00:00:47.489> them

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
and you just pretty much whacked them

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.209 
and you just pretty much whacked them
with<00:00:48.000> it<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.899> be<00:00:49.020> honest<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.590> was<00:00:49.620> really

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
with it and to be honest it was really

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.160 
with it and to be honest it was really
irritating<00:00:51.000> because<00:00:51.149> sometimes<00:00:51.809> you<00:00:52.050> would

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
irritating because sometimes you would

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.350 
irritating because sometimes you would
completely<00:00:52.649> miss<00:00:52.800> him<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> then<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.329> course

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
completely miss him and then of course

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.630 
completely miss him and then of course
you'll<00:00:54.750> just<00:00:54.960> get<00:00:55.170> shot<00:00:55.469> at<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.860> it<00:00:56.250> was<00:00:56.399> just

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
you'll just get shot at and it was just

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.430 
you'll just get shot at and it was just
so<00:00:56.879> frustrating<00:00:57.629> like<00:00:57.750> hands-down

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
so frustrating like hands-down

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.500 
so frustrating like hands-down
it<00:00:58.859> was<00:00:59.010> probably<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.520> most<00:00:59.670> annoying<00:01:00.149> thing

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
it was probably the most annoying thing

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.869 
it was probably the most annoying thing
from<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.140> game<00:01:01.500> now<00:01:02.129> this<00:01:02.370> is<00:01:02.520> something<00:01:02.789> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
from that game now this is something I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.359 
from that game now this is something I
really<00:01:03.149> definitely<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.320> not<00:01:04.619> want<00:01:04.860> to<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.129> in

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
really definitely do not want to see in

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.670 
really definitely do not want to see in
just<00:01:05.670> cause<00:01:05.880> free<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.510> fact<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.350> can't<00:01:07.560> even

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
just cause free in fact if we can't even

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.770 
just cause free in fact if we can't even
use<00:01:07.830> our<00:01:08.250> fists<00:01:08.640> I'd<00:01:08.909> love<00:01:09.210> to<00:01:09.330> have<00:01:09.420> some<00:01:09.570> sort

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
use our fists I'd love to have some sort

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.420 
use our fists I'd love to have some sort
of<00:01:09.869> melee<00:01:10.110> weapon<00:01:10.650> for<00:01:10.830> example<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.400> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of melee weapon for example like a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
of melee weapon for example like a
baseball<00:01:11.760> bear<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:13.200> would<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.350> okay

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
baseball bear I think that would be okay

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.649 
baseball bear I think that would be okay
I'd<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.250> happy<00:01:14.549> with<00:01:14.580> that<00:01:14.729> rather<00:01:15.240> than<00:01:15.540> that

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
I'd be happy with that rather than that

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.570 
I'd be happy with that rather than that
thing<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.080> had<00:01:16.200> back<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.439> Just<00:01:16.830> Cause<00:01:17.009> 2<00:01:17.310> Oh

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
thing we had back in Just Cause 2 Oh

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.910 
thing we had back in Just Cause 2 Oh
what<00:01:18.119> would<00:01:18.210> be<00:01:18.390> even<00:01:18.750> more<00:01:18.780> awesome<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.530> if<00:01:19.770> we

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
what would be even more awesome is if we

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.890 
what would be even more awesome is if we
had<00:01:20.070> now<00:01:20.250> this<00:01:20.460> ability<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.030> use<00:01:21.180> our<00:01:21.540> fists

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
had now this ability to use our fists

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.960 
had now this ability to use our fists
and<00:01:22.140> have<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> fist<00:01:23.040> fight<00:01:23.280> where<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.580> can<00:01:23.820> go

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and have a fist fight where you can go

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.090 
and have a fist fight where you can go
into<00:01:24.150> like<00:01:24.360> someone<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.960> free<00:01:25.259> combo<00:01:25.680> sort<00:01:25.979> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
into like someone to free combo sort of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
into like someone to free combo sort of
thing<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.520> would<00:01:27.060> be<00:01:27.240> absolutely<00:01:27.810> insane

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
thing that would be absolutely insane

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.319 
thing that would be absolutely insane
and<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.680> really<00:01:29.009> would<00:01:29.280> help<00:01:29.549> out<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.939> lot<00:01:30.119> as

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
and it really would help out a lot as

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:32.600 
and it really would help out a lot as
well<00:01:30.360> and<00:01:30.840> overall<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.829> think<00:01:31.890> it<00:01:32.340> would<00:01:32.460> make

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
well and overall I think it would make

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.609 
well and overall I think it would make
Rico<00:01:33.090> just<00:01:33.450> look<00:01:33.750> more<00:01:33.990> like<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.380> badass

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
Rico just look more like it badass

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
Rico just look more like it badass
because<00:01:35.280> let's<00:01:35.579> just<00:01:35.670> say<00:01:35.880> we<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.270> go<00:01:36.479> through

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
because let's just say we do go through

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
because let's just say we do go through
with<00:01:37.049> this<00:01:37.200> combo<00:01:37.680> thing<00:01:38.009> let's<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.610> say<00:01:38.820> for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
with this combo thing let's just say for

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.030 
with this combo thing let's just say for
example<00:01:39.570> they<00:01:39.720> give<00:01:39.780> you<00:01:40.259> circle<00:01:40.799> eggs

awesome

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.220 
awesome
but<00:02:20.670> as<00:02:20.819> I've<00:02:21.030> mentioned<00:02:21.180> before<00:02:21.689> if<00:02:21.930> this

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
but as I've mentioned before if this

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.020 
but as I've mentioned before if this
isn't<00:02:22.500> the<00:02:22.769> case<00:02:22.950> that<00:02:23.159> we<00:02:23.310> can't<00:02:23.609> use<00:02:23.819> our

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030

I'd<00:02:24.569> really<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.409> betsa<00:02:25.799> melee<00:02:26.010> combat<00:02:26.519> again

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
I'd really like betsa melee combat again

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.849 
I'd really like betsa melee combat again
as<00:02:27.209> mentioned<00:02:27.450> before<00:02:27.959> for<00:02:28.139> example<00:02:28.260> a

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
as mentioned before for example a

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.589 
as mentioned before for example a
baseball<00:02:29.159> bat<00:02:29.519> I<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:30.299> that<00:02:30.480> would<00:02:30.569> be

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
baseball bat I think that would be

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.420 
baseball bat I think that would be
pretty<00:02:30.900> nice<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.560> maybe<00:02:31.769> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.159> have<00:02:32.310> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
pretty nice and maybe you can have the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.280 
pretty nice and maybe you can have the
ability<00:02:32.939> to<00:02:32.969> upgrade<00:02:33.239> your<00:02:33.689> baseball<00:02:34.109> bat

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
ability to upgrade your baseball bat

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
ability to upgrade your baseball bat
maybe<00:02:34.859> it's<00:02:35.069> like<00:02:35.219> a<00:02:35.280> crazy<00:02:35.639> level<00:02:36.209> where

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
maybe it's like a crazy level where

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.449 
maybe it's like a crazy level where
eventually<00:02:36.810> your<00:02:37.290> baseball<00:02:37.739> bat<00:02:37.859> has<00:02:38.069> nails

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
eventually your baseball bat has nails

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.670 
eventually your baseball bat has nails
or<00:02:38.700> something<00:02:39.150> like<00:02:39.359> that<00:02:39.420> something<00:02:40.230> really

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
or something like that something really

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.770 
or something like that something really
I<00:02:41.010> don't<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.489> brutal<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.299> guess<00:02:42.510> you<00:02:42.629> could

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
I don't know brutal I guess you could

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:44.990 
I don't know brutal I guess you could
say<00:02:42.959> that<00:02:43.200> will<00:02:43.439> affect<00:02:43.799> your<00:02:43.950> opponent<00:02:44.549> a<00:02:44.669> lot

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000
