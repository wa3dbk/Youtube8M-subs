00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:19.760
 very good rice those in this chapter 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.730
 we will see closely the environment of 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.290
 programming n xtf said environment to weigh 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.060
 to be intuitive easy when it comes to 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.850
 start programming can become 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.250
 something complex and difficult if we have in 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.660
 account all its characteristics in this 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.430
 video tutorial we will start with the 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.290
 maximum when we start the application 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.170
 from lego mindstorm we see the window 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.270
 getting start windows start window 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.829
 from where we can open a new 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:45.470
 program or open a program already 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.660
 existing these tutorials are made 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.000
 with the retail nx software version 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:51.440
 2.0 so in other versions or 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.110
 operating systems the screen can 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.480
 vary click on the go button in the section 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.710
 a new program created to create a 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.510
 new program without title 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.219
 let's see the different sections of 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.019
 environment first of all we have the 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.210
 center of the screen where we see a 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.970
 white background is the work area 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.010
 also known as program sheet es 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.970
 say programming sheet because it simulates 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.980
 a checkered paper 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.390
 the tabs on top we 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.130
 allow you to select the different 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.020
 programs that we have open and the 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.880
 tab with the small square we 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.380
 allows you to go back to the screen 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:24.909
 start 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.649
 in the lower left corner of 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.539
 work area we find the pallets 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.820
 of programming that contain all the 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:32.710
 blocks used to create programs for 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.000
 make programming easier there 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.420
 three palettes that we can select 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.189
 clicking on each of the tabs 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.630
 the first one is the common palette and 

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.490
 contains the blocks most commonly 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.890
 used giving you more direct access 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:46.780
 to them the center selects the 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.369
 palette completes all blocks 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.280
 available are in this palette 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.500
 including some of the common palette 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.510
 the last tab selection to the palette 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.010
 custom where the blocks will appear 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:01.470
 we create our blogs 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:04.320
 to the right of the work area we see 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.780
 the robot center or theft educator in 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.690
 educational versions and the window my 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.610
 portal if we select the other tab 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.780
 in robot center we have available 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.400
 programming instructions and 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.520
 construction for some projects of 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.980
 example as the robber gators alpha rex the 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.690
 short erbol the construction of sayings 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.610
 projects is a very good way and 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.890
 Simple to familiarize yourself in the environment 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.760
 main store closing this window 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.040
 we get a bigger work area 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.079
 as we have already said in the right area 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:36.019
 of the screen we can choose between my 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.700
 portal and then center my portal we 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.980
 shows some interesting links to 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.170
 the web of live my nÃ©stor where you can 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.840
 find among other things projects 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.849
 made by other users 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.680
 in the lower left we have 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:50.209
 the configuration panel from where 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.310
 we will configure the blocks that make 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.650
 operate our program 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.660
 on the opposite side we find the panel 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.760
 of help and navigation if we select 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.080
 the help panel shows us a 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.660
 small block description 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.640
 selected by clicking on morehead 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.550
 will open a help screen more 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.569
 Completion of all blocks 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.280
 clicking on the tab where the 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.260
 small magnifying glass you access the panel 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.510
 navigation when we are working with 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.220
 very large programs this panel we 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.560
 allows us to select which part we want 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.910
 see from our program now you will not be able 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.030
 see the description of the block in use 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.140
 but if the map of your program 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.330
 finally in the right corner of 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.769
 work area is the controller a 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.450
 set of five buttons that we 

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:32.390
 allows the connection between the environment 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.850
 graphic and the smart brick of 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.650
 these five buttons this helps us to 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.010
 download and directly execute the 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.150
 program in our DNA there is this 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:43.190
 allow the properties and 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.410
 characteristics of our nx del 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.569
 brick is to say the properties the 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.250
 space in memory this allows us 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:52.880
 only download the program in the 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.739
 brick with this button we can stop the 

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:57.200
 program that is running and with 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.600
 this other one we will only load and 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.490
 we will execute the part 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.380
 we have selected the program 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:05.420
 good and that has been everything I hope that you 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:07.280
 have liked and you know you can do it 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 at any suggestion or tell me if you 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.110
 like more music lower higher if 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.620
 it is well understood that it is a form of 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:17.840
 Drape that you like more and good in the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.209
 next chapter we will talk about the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:27.310
 first the first programs created 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.310
 in this axis and that's it until later
