00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.300

 and there it is wonderful in Bundorf a friendship but I can 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.270

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.700
 wonderful also the often rough climate of taste 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.870
 after a weak main round, cracks were top 8 

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.760
 I see that I got on it earlier 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.550

 wonderful so I can also speaker 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.220
 that's why we double as we said it can be no success 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.100
 I also hoped that very rarely 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.080
 any 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.900
 then only small-scale but simply because it is a toddler in Ankara 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.039
 Juniper path light extreme 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.009
 strong from the 15 of the taste too 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.829

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.099
 between the pieces 

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.609

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:44.859
 nice dick was not helping so I found the entry package wonderful 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.309
 then it is open to everyone to express the assessment 

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:51.089
 the whole thing is not possible 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:52.199

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:59.949
 Smoke 

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:01.819
 pleasantly rough 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.739
 the Sat 1 1 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.679

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.289
 Dob's comment too 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:21.659

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.749
 Pauli 4 Francis is for Lulu one smokes extremely slowly so I shut 

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.049
 have 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:27.860
 the latter 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:30.089
 then smoked a little later 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:33.839
 I needed three hours, then I had to go through it, I was all ready 

00:03:34.689 --> 00:03:36.269
 as she does this 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.089
 suitable for bad but when I stuff so full of water and off 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:43.549

 May about 3g should be my latest achievement 

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:53.699
 In 2002, this pledge I grab this wonderful July dedication 

00:03:55.439 --> 00:03:57.859
 for comparison against Stendal 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:03:58.929
 so now 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.769
 really fast the whole 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.389
 even if we mistake again which I think is very nice 

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:06.980
 and the Krad for the break or if you do not have that much time you have access 

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:09.519
 also 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.329
 nevertheless large birds still around here » 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.689
 one is and moves like that 

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.549
 so and now still great for polo 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:19.689
 and that was good but not going on 

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.370
 if we do not really care about her 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.289
 but just for the break 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.479
 well prepared 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:31.059
 a character experience of the year 2010 Schranz Clark percent 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:34.300
 that this community has discovered giant videos all over YouTube 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:37.939
 the universe is the 1 

00:04:37.939 --> 00:04:39.680
 that's how FIFA is going 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:43.020
 no consumer increasingly ambivalent PC off 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.909
 he also doubts as well as electoral cards are important 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:49.949
 Community here on YouTube and that's my personality result 2010 

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:55.259
 FY he is 2010, no one was lucky 

00:04:55.759 --> 00:04:58.969
 and I hope that 1 comes in the next six weeks until the end 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:00.169
 is 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:01.689
 everything shines 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:03.990
 I still have it there 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.460
 and Malczak Mensch the year 2010 is for me quite clear Gallen not a lot 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.309
 problem 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:12.979
 quite simply because I as me 

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:15.789
 all videos from YouTube WK 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:19.689
 i'm glad when i looked up at the beginning that i got you i got him 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:22.689
 personally better Pfeiffer also noticed what they say 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.830
 just at the beginning does not scare 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.289
 even almost downright 

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:32.289
 It worked out right for me did that 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:35.449
 by a move nobody expected correctly 

00:05:35.449 --> 00:05:36.559
 we need 

00:05:36.559 --> 00:05:39.180
 after doubt a pity 2 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.670
 for FIFA, one has to say then all the videos of soon is not only 

00:05:42.669 --> 00:05:43.860
