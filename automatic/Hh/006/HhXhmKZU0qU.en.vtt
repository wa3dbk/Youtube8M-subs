00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
video of somebody making a levitation

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.220 
video of somebody making a levitation
photo<00:06:30.060> it<00:06:30.510> would<00:06:30.600> be<00:06:30.690> really<00:06:30.840> cool<00:06:30.930> to<00:06:31.110> see

photo it would be really cool to see
this<00:06:31.470> i<00:06:31.650> think<00:06:32.190> this<00:06:32.280> is<00:06:32.340> good<00:06:32.700> the<00:06:33.120> scene<00:06:33.390> is

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:33.570 
this i think this is good the scene is

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:35.510 
this i think this is good the scene is
not<00:06:34.080> as<00:06:34.260> interesting<00:06:34.680> as<00:06:34.800> i<00:06:34.890> would<00:06:34.950> like<00:06:35.250> but<00:06:35.310> i

00:06:35.510 --> 00:06:35.520 
not as interesting as i would like but i

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:37.490 
not as interesting as i would like but i
think<00:06:35.790> the<00:06:35.880> execution<00:06:36.150> is<00:06:36.540> really<00:06:37.110> cool<00:06:37.290> and

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:37.500 
think the execution is really cool and

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:39.650 
think the execution is really cool and
you<00:06:38.220> know<00:06:38.340> he's<00:06:38.790> just<00:06:38.820> flying<00:06:39.360> in<00:06:39.570> the<00:06:39.630> air

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
you know he's just flying in the air

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.140 
you know he's just flying in the air
it's<00:06:39.870> like

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.150 
it's like

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:42.780 
it's like
Mary<00:06:40.270> Poppins<00:06:40.890> really<00:06:41.890> liked<00:06:42.070> it<00:06:42.280> thought<00:06:42.730> it

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:42.790 
Mary Poppins really liked it thought it

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:44.520 
Mary Poppins really liked it thought it
was<00:06:42.910> worthwhile<00:06:43.180> to<00:06:43.600> put<00:06:43.750> it<00:06:43.870> here<00:06:44.170> into<00:06:44.350> the

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
was worthwhile to put it here into the

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:47.550
