came with a little cleaning cloth which

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.900 
came with a little cleaning cloth which
I<00:00:48.450> thought<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.750> really<00:00:48.899> nice<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.350> clean<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
I thought was really nice to clean the

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.029 
I thought was really nice to clean the
lenses<00:00:51.289> and<00:00:52.289> it<00:00:52.500> came<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.949> three<00:00:53.719> separate

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:55.039 
lenses and it came with three separate

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.540 
lenses and it came with three separate
lenses<00:00:56.039> uh<00:00:56.780> for<00:00:57.780> magnification<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> can

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
lenses uh for magnification so you can

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.869 
lenses uh for magnification so you can
change<00:01:00.410> the<00:01:01.410> distance<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.039> magnification

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
change the distance of the magnification

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.299 
change the distance of the magnification
to<00:01:03.000> whatever<00:01:03.300> best<00:01:03.719> fits<00:01:04.439> your<00:01:04.650> needs<00:01:04.890> however

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
to whatever best fits your needs however

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.170 
to whatever best fits your needs however
I<00:01:05.400> thought<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.939> default<00:01:07.400> magnification<00:01:08.400> was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
I thought the default magnification was

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.910 
I thought the default magnification was
the<00:01:09.330> best<00:01:09.540> one<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.020> we<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.350> into<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
the best one but we can go into that a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.120 
the best one but we can go into that a
little<00:01:11.250> bit<00:01:11.430> later<00:01:11.670> um<00:01:12.890> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> course

played<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.090> was<00:02:09.450> actually<00:02:09.720> put<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.379> some

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
played this was actually put on some

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.980 
played this was actually put on some
headphones<00:02:11.069> on<00:02:11.790> top<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.480> this

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
headphones on top of this

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:14.600 
headphones on top of this
and<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.590> would<00:02:13.740> shut<00:02:13.950> off<00:02:14.100> the<00:02:14.220> lights<00:02:14.430> because

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and I would shut off the lights because

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.920 
and I would shut off the lights because
they<00:02:14.760> can<00:02:14.880> see<00:02:15.060> a<00:02:15.090> little<00:02:15.270> bit<00:02:15.480> of<00:02:15.540> light

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
they can see a little bit of light

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.600 
they can see a little bit of light
through<00:02:16.200> the<00:02:16.260> bottom<00:02:16.620> of<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.100> nose<00:02:17.280> right

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
playing with this um I get incredibly

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.110 
playing with this um I get incredibly
motion<00:02:38.940> sick<00:02:39.240> of<00:02:40.010> playing<00:02:41.010> games<00:02:41.520> there<00:02:42.000> are

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
motion sick of playing games there are

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.910 
motion sick of playing games there are
some<00:02:42.300> first-person<00:02:43.050> shooters<00:02:43.350> like<00:02:43.590> half

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
some first-person shooters like half

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.470 
some first-person shooters like half
life<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.550> I've<00:02:44.670> never<00:02:44.820> even<00:02:45.030> really<00:02:45.360> been

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
life that I've never even really been

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.990 
life that I've never even really been
able<00:02:45.600> to<00:02:45.750> complete<00:02:46.170> because<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.760> motion

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
able to complete because just the motion

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.570 
able to complete because just the motion
makes<00:02:48.420> me<00:02:48.660> nauseous<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.470> get<00:02:49.650> dizzy<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.250> strains

makes me nauseous I get dizzy it strains
my<00:02:50.730> eyes<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:51.540> believe<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.620> first<00:02:52.860> bioshock<00:02:53.340> did

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
my eyes I believe the first bioshock did

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.730 
my eyes I believe the first bioshock did

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
head but I'm really sensitive to that

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.590 
head but I'm really sensitive to that
kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.250> motion<00:03:02.670> which<00:03:02.760> is<00:03:02.970> strange<00:03:03.300> because

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:03.600 
kind of motion which is strange because

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:05.870 
kind of motion which is strange because
I<00:03:04.170> can<00:03:04.350> do<00:03:04.470> roller<00:03:04.740> coasters<00:03:05.250> I<00:03:05.430> can<00:03:05.610> fly<00:03:05.820> in

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
airplanes I can do all of that stuff

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.580 
airplanes I can do all of that stuff
just<00:03:08.610> fine<00:03:08.910> I<00:03:08.940> could<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.870> speed<00:03:10.200> off<00:03:10.350> in<00:03:10.380> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
just fine I could like speed off in a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.490 
just fine I could like speed off in a
motorboat<00:03:11.330> and<00:03:12.330> all<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.750> that<00:03:12.780> but<00:03:12.960> for<00:03:13.260> some

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
motorboat and all of that but for some

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.710 
motorboat and all of that but for some
reason<00:03:14.250> it's<00:03:14.520> like<00:03:14.700> my<00:03:14.820> eyes<00:03:15.060> don't<00:03:15.420> know

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
reason it's like my eyes don't know

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.540 
reason it's like my eyes don't know
where<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.020> focus<00:03:16.410> when<00:03:16.860> looking<00:03:17.130> at<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.310> screen
