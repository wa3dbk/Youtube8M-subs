00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
everyone I'm gonna talk about creating

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.410 
everyone I'm gonna talk about creating
an<00:00:07.049> interesting<00:00:07.350> bed<00:00:08.010> of<00:00:08.280> droning<00:00:09.120> tracks

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
an interesting bed of droning tracks

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.350 
an interesting bed of droning tracks
today<00:00:10.070> I'm<00:00:11.070> gonna<00:00:11.309> go<00:00:11.580> about<00:00:11.670> doing<00:00:12.030> this<00:00:12.150> is

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
today I'm gonna go about doing this is

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.049 
today I'm gonna go about doing this is
using<00:00:12.630> this<00:00:12.960> full<00:00:13.259> tone<00:00:13.469> tape<00:00:13.710> echo<00:00:13.910> on<00:00:14.910> the

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
using this full tone tape echo on the

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.410 
using this full tone tape echo on the
floor<00:00:15.299> I<00:00:15.599> have<00:00:15.870> a<00:00:16.139> Keeley<00:00:16.560> compressor<00:00:17.190> and<00:00:17.460> I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
floor I have a Keeley compressor and I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630 
floor I have a Keeley compressor and I
have<00:00:18.600> an<00:00:18.690> electro<00:00:18.990> harmonix<00:00:19.410> freeze<00:00:19.680> pedal<00:00:20.070> so

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
have an electro harmonix freeze pedal so

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.189 
have an electro harmonix freeze pedal so
between<00:00:21.000> these<00:00:21.150> three<00:00:21.390> devices<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
between these three devices and the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.050 
between these three devices and the
volume<00:00:22.529> knob<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.550> Fender<00:00:23.820> Stratocaster

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
volume knob on this Fender Stratocaster

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.599 
volume knob on this Fender Stratocaster
I'm<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.320> create<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.740> whole<00:00:26.039> bed<00:00:26.220> of<00:00:26.250> tracks

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
I'm gonna create a whole bed of tracks

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.820 
I'm gonna create a whole bed of tracks
that<00:00:27.060> all<00:00:27.420> together<00:00:27.900> are<00:00:28.140> gonna<00:00:28.199> be<00:00:28.410> automated

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
that all together are gonna be automated

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.780 
that all together are gonna be automated
and<00:00:29.189> almost<00:00:29.939> create<00:00:30.179> like<00:00:30.390> an<00:00:30.630> orchestra<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:31.790 
and almost create like an orchestra of

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:36.709 
and almost create like an orchestra of
ambient<00:00:32.790> sounds<00:00:34.250> how<00:00:35.250> I'm<00:00:35.430> doing<00:00:35.940> this<00:00:36.090> is

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
ambient sounds how I'm doing this is

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
ambient sounds how I'm doing this is
basically<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.800> Keeley<00:00:38.190> pedal<00:00:38.670> the

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
basically the Keeley pedal the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.030 
basically the Keeley pedal the
compressor<00:00:39.390> I'm<00:00:39.510> just<00:00:39.690> using<00:00:40.050> that<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.500> get

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
compressor I'm just using that to get

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.830 
compressor I'm just using that to get
some<00:00:41.280> sustain<00:00:41.820> because<00:00:42.450> I'm<00:00:42.690> playing

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
some sustain because I'm playing

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.810 
some sustain because I'm playing
completely<00:00:43.320> clean<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.250> get<00:00:44.370> some<00:00:44.550> some

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
completely clean so to get some some

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.610 
completely clean so to get some some
sustain<00:00:45.239> out<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> guitar<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.289> the

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
sustain out the guitar I have the

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.350 
sustain out the guitar I have the
compressor<00:00:47.070> I'm<00:00:47.280> pretty<00:00:47.489> hot<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:48.030> it's<00:00:48.210> just

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
compressor I'm pretty hot so it's just

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
compressor I'm pretty hot so it's just
when<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.809> play<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.230> note<00:00:49.500> or<00:00:49.890> swallow<00:00:50.430> note<00:00:50.640> and

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
when I play a note or swallow note and

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.880 
when I play a note or swallow note and
it<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:51.059> grabs<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.170> freeze<00:00:52.469> pedal<00:00:52.800> I

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
it just grabs it now the freeze pedal I

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.860 
it just grabs it now the freeze pedal I
use<00:00:53.070> sometimes<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.390> know<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.690> freeze

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
use sometimes if you know the freeze

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.000 
use sometimes if you know the freeze
pedal<00:00:55.170> does<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.680> it<00:00:56.129> grabs<00:00:56.399> just<00:00:57.270> a<00:00:57.360> miniscule

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
pedal does is it grabs just a miniscule

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.799 
pedal does is it grabs just a miniscule
snapshot<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.219> your<00:00:59.489> tone<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.030> just<00:01:00.449> holds<00:01:00.750> it

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
snapshot of your tone and just holds it

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
snapshot of your tone and just holds it
like<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:00.989> drone<00:01:01.289> almost<00:01:02.070> kind<00:01:02.280> of<00:01:02.340> gets<00:01:02.820> like<00:01:02.969> an

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
like a drone almost kind of gets like an

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.149 
like a drone almost kind of gets like an
organ<00:01:03.420> etype<00:01:03.719> sound<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.379> it<00:01:04.500> when<00:01:04.650> you<00:01:04.769> grab<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
organ etype sound to it when you grab a

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.490 
organ etype sound to it when you grab a
note<00:01:05.430> or<00:01:05.610> chord<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:06.570> just<00:01:06.840> gonna<00:01:06.960> be<00:01:07.140> grabbing

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
note or chord I'm just gonna be grabbing

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.640 
note or chord I'm just gonna be grabbing
notes<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.610> I'm<00:01:09.360> gonna<00:01:09.630> create<00:01:10.080> chords

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
notes because I'm gonna create chords

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.429 
notes because I'm gonna create chords
right<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.520> we<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.090> three<00:01:12.570> chords<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.320> I'm

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
right so we have three chords that I'm

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.670 
right so we have three chords that I'm
gonna<00:01:13.619> be<00:01:14.000> arranging<00:01:15.170> feedback<00:01:16.170> loops<00:01:16.409> for

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
gonna be arranging feedback loops for

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.249 
gonna be arranging feedback loops for
here<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.130> I'm<00:01:17.700> gonna<00:01:17.790> layout<00:01:18.270> feedback<00:01:18.869> loops

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
here so I'm gonna layout feedback loops

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.740 
here so I'm gonna layout feedback loops
for<00:01:19.680> three<00:01:20.159> different<00:01:20.310> chords<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.090> from

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
for three different chords and from

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.660 
for three different chords and from
there<00:01:21.960> I'm<00:01:22.140> gonna<00:01:22.350> automate<00:01:22.860> them<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.520> out

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
there I'm gonna automate them in and out

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.450 
there I'm gonna automate them in and out
so<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.570> means<00:01:24.780> for<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.020> G<00:01:25.409> chord<00:01:25.439> I'm<00:01:25.950> going<00:01:26.369> to

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
so that means for a G chord I'm going to

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.270 
so that means for a G chord I'm going to
lay<00:01:26.670> out<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.150> root<00:01:27.659> third<00:01:28.049> fifth<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.710> octave

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
lay out the root third fifth and octave

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.550 
lay out the root third fifth and octave
and<00:01:29.729> I'm<00:01:30.240> also<00:01:30.390> going<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:30.659> do<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.930> for<00:01:31.229> a<00:01:31.259> C

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
and I'm also going to do that for a C

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
and I'm also going to do that for a C
chord<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.430> D<00:01:32.610> chord<00:01:33.020> after<00:01:34.020> I<00:01:34.259> get<00:01:34.380> all<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
chord and a D chord after I get all that

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.590 
chord and a D chord after I get all that
done<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.340> gonna<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.060> through<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.450> going

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
done I'm gonna go through and I'm going

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.690 
done I'm gonna go through and I'm going
to<00:01:36.659> automate<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.650> interval<00:01:37.950> so<00:01:38.280> when<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
to automate the interval so when the

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.010 
to automate the interval so when the
chords<00:01:39.030> change<00:01:39.360> whenever<00:01:39.630> I<00:01:39.689> need<00:01:39.869> them<00:01:39.900> to

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
chords change whenever I need them to

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.889 
chords change whenever I need them to
change<00:01:40.340> they<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.939> feedback<00:01:42.360> loops<00:01:42.659> will

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
change they the feedback loops will

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.069 
change they the feedback loops will
change<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.560> logic<00:01:44.159> what<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> did<00:01:44.880> was<00:01:45.479> I<00:01:45.780> set<00:01:46.049> up

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
change in logic what I did was I set up

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.780 
change in logic what I did was I set up
a<00:01:46.409> bunch<00:01:46.680> of<00:01:46.770> tracks<00:01:47.100> that<00:01:47.280> you'll<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> able<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
a bunch of tracks that you'll be able to

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.510 
a bunch of tracks that you'll be able to
see<00:01:47.970> here<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.630> labeled<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.290> what<00:01:50.040> note<00:01:50.310> and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
see here and I labeled it what note and

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.210 
see here and I labeled it what note and
what<00:01:50.729> interval<00:01:51.090> it's<00:01:51.210> going<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.570> be<00:01:52.009> I'm<00:01:53.009> using

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
what interval it's going to be I'm using

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.480 
what interval it's going to be I'm using

give you an example of how I'm gonna do

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.490 
give you an example of how I'm gonna do
this<00:02:44.739> I'm<00:02:45.739> gonna<00:02:46.010> set<00:02:46.310> up<00:02:46.459> an<00:02:46.670> 8<00:02:46.909> bar<00:02:47.120> loop<00:02:50.500> let

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
this I'm gonna set up an 8 bar loop let

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.470 
this I'm gonna set up an 8 bar loop let
me<00:02:51.620> explain<00:02:51.920> each<00:02:52.250> of<00:02:52.340> these<00:02:52.609> components<00:02:53.299> do

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
me explain each of these components do

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.839 
me explain each of these components do
so<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.409> freeze<00:02:54.620> pedal<00:02:55.010> watch<00:02:55.340> what<00:02:55.519> happens

00:02:55.839 --> 00:02:55.849 
so the freeze pedal watch what happens

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:58.720 
so the freeze pedal watch what happens
when<00:02:55.970> I<00:02:56.030> hit<00:02:56.120> a<00:02:56.180> note<00:02:57.040> when<00:02:58.040> I<00:02:58.129> grab<00:02:58.370> it<00:02:58.579> with

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
when I hit a note when I grab it with

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.690 
when I hit a note when I grab it with
the<00:02:58.819> freeze<00:02:59.440> hands<00:03:00.440> are<00:03:00.530> free<00:03:00.769> you're<00:03:01.459> out

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
the freeze hands are free you're out

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.660 
the freeze hands are free you're out
staying<00:03:02.150> then

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
staying then

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.180 
staying then
low<00:03:04.180> reading<00:03:04.650> organization

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
low reading organization

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:16.839 
low reading organization
the<00:03:07.670> delay

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.420 

or<00:03:17.060> weird<00:03:17.719> things<00:03:18.049> in<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.379> story<00:03:18.680> all<00:03:19.010> right<00:03:19.129> I

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
or weird things in the story all right I

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.360 
or weird things in the story all right I
might<00:03:20.090> do<00:03:20.299> a<00:03:20.329> combination<00:03:20.719> of<00:03:21.139> these<00:03:21.319> two<00:03:21.620> so<00:03:22.340> I

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
might do a combination of these two so I

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.820 
might do a combination of these two so I
might

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.130 

get<00:03:26.400> some<00:03:26.580> cool<00:03:26.850> happening<00:03:27.420> with<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> freeze

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
get some cool happening with the freeze

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.430 
get some cool happening with the freeze
battle

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.260 

and<00:03:36.440> I'm<00:03:36.950> gonna<00:03:37.130> set<00:03:37.430> it<00:03:37.520> up<00:03:37.640> now<00:03:37.940> I'm<00:03:38.030> going<00:03:38.180> to

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
and I'm gonna set it up now I'm going to

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.930 
and I'm gonna set it up now I'm going to
do<00:03:38.360> the<00:03:38.480> third<00:03:38.750> which<00:03:39.380> is<00:03:39.410> a<00:03:39.560> B<00:03:39.770> note<00:03:40.010> or<00:03:40.580> an<00:03:40.730> G

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
do the third which is a B note or an G

00:03:40.940 --> 00:04:05.340 
do the third which is a B note or an G
chord

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.100 

okay<00:04:07.240> you're<00:04:08.240> gonna<00:04:08.330> follow<00:04:08.569> this<00:04:08.810> through

okay you're gonna follow this through

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.250 
okay you're gonna follow this through
with<00:04:09.440> each<00:04:09.650> interval<00:04:10.250> that<00:04:11.150> I<00:04:11.540> want<00:04:12.020> to<00:04:12.140> add

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
with each interval that I want to add

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.410 
with each interval that I want to add
the<00:04:12.560> cord<00:04:12.830> v<00:04:13.250> I<00:04:13.490> might<00:04:13.700> actually<00:04:13.850> change<00:04:14.209> some

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
the cord v I might actually change some

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.240 
the cord v I might actually change some
of<00:04:14.450> the<00:04:14.600> delay<00:04:14.900> settings<00:04:15.350> up<00:04:15.560> here<00:04:15.590> at<00:04:15.860> the<00:04:15.920> x

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:16.250 
of the delay settings up here at the x

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.340 
of the delay settings up here at the x
okay<00:04:17.120> if<00:04:17.299> I<00:04:17.389> just<00:04:17.480> wanted<00:04:17.660> to<00:04:17.750> listen<00:04:17.900> back<00:04:18.139> to

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
okay if I just wanted to listen back to

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:32.310 
okay if I just wanted to listen back to
this<00:04:18.500> cord

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.960 

I<00:04:34.740> wanted<00:04:35.740> to<00:04:35.830> hear<00:04:36.070> all<00:04:36.280> the<00:04:36.430> tracks<00:04:36.670> together

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:36.970 
I wanted to hear all the tracks together

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.170 
I wanted to hear all the tracks together
that<00:04:37.210> just<00:04:37.240> recorded<00:04:37.990> I<00:04:38.340> just<00:04:39.340> created<00:04:39.940> a<00:04:40.000> four

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
that just recorded I just created a four

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.300 
that just recorded I just created a four
bar<00:04:40.360> loop<00:04:40.780> out<00:04:41.080> of<00:04:41.140> the<00:04:41.290> eight<00:04:41.470> bar<00:04:41.740> loop<00:04:41.980> that

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
bar loop out of the eight bar loop that

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.740 
bar loop out of the eight bar loop that
I'm<00:04:42.460> just<00:04:42.610> gonna<00:04:42.700> have<00:04:42.880> cycle<00:04:43.270> over<00:04:43.510> and<00:04:43.660> over

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:43.750 
I'm just gonna have cycle over and over

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.840 
I'm just gonna have cycle over and over
again<00:04:43.930> we're<00:04:44.140> gonna<00:04:44.230> work<00:04:44.470> from<00:04:44.710> there<00:04:44.950> it's

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
again we're gonna work from there it's

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.490 
again we're gonna work from there it's
not<00:04:45.970> completely<00:04:46.300> smoothed<00:04:46.690> out<00:04:46.900> yet<00:04:47.200> but

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
not completely smoothed out yet but

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.810 
not completely smoothed out yet but
we're<00:04:47.860> just<00:04:47.890> starting<00:04:48.400> to<00:04:48.550> get<00:04:48.640> the<00:04:48.790> idea

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
we're just starting to get the idea

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:58.600 
we're just starting to get the idea
together

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.210 

he<00:04:58.910> kind<00:04:59.180> of<00:04:59.240> is<00:04:59.390> really<00:04:59.600> he<00:05:00.020> remembers

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
he kind of is really he remembers

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.800 
he kind of is really he remembers
the<00:05:02.550> collage<00:05:02.970> and<00:05:03.620> telling<00:05:04.620> textures<00:05:05.810> as

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:06.810 
the collage and telling textures as

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:08.810 
the collage and telling textures as
you'll<00:05:07.290> notice<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.710> record<00:05:08.100> a<00:05:08.250> bunch<00:05:08.370> of<00:05:08.520> tracks

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
you'll notice I record a bunch of tracks

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.450 
you'll notice I record a bunch of tracks
here<00:05:09.260> and<00:05:10.260> there's<00:05:10.560> some<00:05:10.680> automation<00:05:11.130> of<00:05:11.310> them

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
here and there's some automation of them

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.370 
here and there's some automation of them
because<00:05:11.670> I<00:05:11.730> was<00:05:11.850> messing<00:05:12.090> around<00:05:12.330> with<00:05:12.660> moving

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
because I was messing around with moving

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.010 
because I was messing around with moving
some<00:05:13.620> of<00:05:13.650> the<00:05:13.740> notes<00:05:13.950> around<00:05:14.600> let's<00:05:15.600> first

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
some of the notes around let's first

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.740 
some of the notes around let's first
listen<00:05:16.620> to<00:05:16.890> the<00:05:17.400> notes<00:05:17.730> that<00:05:17.970> would<00:05:18.360> just<00:05:18.630> be

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
listen to the notes that would just be

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.690 
listen to the notes that would just be
in<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.930> straight<00:05:19.200> GE<00:05:19.470> chord<00:05:19.800> play

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:26.700 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.170 

that's<00:05:27.270> all<00:05:27.480> open<00:05:27.750> you<00:05:27.840> wanted<00:05:28.230> to<00:05:28.380> hear

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
that's all open you wanted to hear

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:39.660 
that's all open you wanted to hear
OOP<00:05:32.130> there<00:05:33.930> it<00:05:34.930> is

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:39.670 

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:46.379 

same<00:05:40.390> thing<00:05:40.600> for<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.870> Secord

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:46.389 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:48.300 

and<00:05:46.599> I<00:05:46.870> have<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.050> D<00:05:47.289> chord<00:05:47.590> over<00:05:47.770> here<00:05:47.919> too<00:05:48.159> as

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
and I have a D chord over here too as

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:54.410 
and I have a D chord over here too as
well

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:57.230 

now<00:05:55.260> this<00:05:55.440> is<00:05:55.650> different<00:05:55.980> than<00:05:56.520> using<00:05:57.120> a

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
now this is different than using a

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.960 
now this is different than using a
keyboard<00:05:57.480> to<00:05:58.440> create<00:05:58.710> chords<00:05:59.400> with<00:05:59.580> samples

00:05:59.960 --> 00:05:59.970 
keyboard to create chords with samples

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:02.780 
keyboard to create chords with samples
on<00:06:00.120> it<00:06:00.270> because<00:06:00.890> what's<00:06:01.890> unique<00:06:02.310> about<00:06:02.430> this

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:02.790 
on it because what's unique about this

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:04.550 
on it because what's unique about this
is<00:06:02.850> each<00:06:03.390> one<00:06:03.660> of<00:06:03.720> these<00:06:03.810> loop<00:06:04.080> centers

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:04.560 
is each one of these loop centers

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.250 
is each one of these loop centers
recorded<00:06:05.250> it<00:06:05.370> has<00:06:05.550> some<00:06:06.120> inconsistencies<00:06:06.960> and

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
recorded it has some inconsistencies and

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.640 
recorded it has some inconsistencies and
or<00:06:07.470> imperfections<00:06:08.540> which<00:06:09.540> makes<00:06:09.990> them<00:06:10.290> rub

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:10.650 
or imperfections which makes them rub

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:11.930 
or imperfections which makes them rub
against<00:06:10.920> each<00:06:11.130> other<00:06:11.340> in<00:06:11.490> different<00:06:11.640> way

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:11.940 
against each other in different way

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.120 
against each other in different way
there's<00:06:12.180> different<00:06:12.570> overtones<00:06:13.470> there's

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.130 
there's different overtones there's

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.830 
there's different overtones there's
there's<00:06:14.490> different<00:06:14.670> speeds

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:15.840 
there's different speeds

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:17.560 
there's different speeds
that<00:06:16.110> the<00:06:16.350> tape<00:06:16.560> or<00:06:16.860> the<00:06:16.920> echoes<00:06:17.340> are

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
that the tape or the echoes are

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.150 
that the tape or the echoes are
repeating<00:06:18.570> themselves<00:06:19.140> and<00:06:19.470> when<00:06:20.070> you

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:20.160 
repeating themselves and when you

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.770 
repeating themselves and when you
combine<00:06:20.430> them<00:06:20.520> together<00:06:20.670> it's<00:06:21.120> just<00:06:21.390> that<00:06:21.540> it

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:21.780 
combine them together it's just that it

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:24.800 
combine them together it's just that it
creates<00:06:22.080> a<00:06:22.170> little<00:06:22.320> bit<00:06:22.440> more<00:06:22.740> of<00:06:22.860> a<00:06:23.810> importand

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
creates a little bit more of a importand

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:27.530 
creates a little bit more of a importand
perfect<00:06:25.290> industrial<00:06:26.100> kind<00:06:26.340> of<00:06:26.550> ambient<00:06:27.300> sound

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:27.540 
perfect industrial kind of ambient sound

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:32.060 
perfect industrial kind of ambient sound
than<00:06:27.900> just<00:06:28.560> using<00:06:28.740> like<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.070> synth<00:06:29.640> pad<00:06:31.070> where

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.070 
than just using like a synth pad where

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:36.470 
than just using like a synth pad where
it<00:06:32.190> really<00:06:32.310> gets<00:06:32.460> fun<00:06:32.700> is<00:06:33.410> if<00:06:34.490> we<00:06:35.490> pull<00:06:36.240> up<00:06:36.270> a

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:36.480 
it really gets fun is if we pull up a

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.220 
it really gets fun is if we pull up a
section<00:06:36.720> in<00:06:36.930> a<00:06:37.020> song<00:06:37.290> and<00:06:38.150> we<00:06:39.150> I'm<00:06:39.960> going<00:06:40.140> to

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:40.230 
section in a song and we I'm going to

00:06:40.230 --> 00:06:42.530 
section in a song and we I'm going to
set<00:06:40.560> up<00:06:40.680> like<00:06:40.890> a<00:06:40.920> G<00:06:41.610> chord<00:06:41.640> here<00:06:42.150> and<00:06:42.360> I'm<00:06:42.420> going

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:42.540 
set up like a G chord here and I'm going

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:43.700 
set up like a G chord here and I'm going
to<00:06:42.570> show<00:06:42.750> you<00:06:42.810> a<00:06:42.870> few<00:06:42.990> things<00:06:43.200> that<00:06:43.410> like<00:06:43.560> we

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
to show you a few things that like we

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.820 
to show you a few things that like we
can<00:06:43.890> turn<00:06:44.250> it<00:06:44.370> into<00:06:44.460> other<00:06:45.090> chords<00:06:45.900> here's<00:06:46.650> our

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
can turn it into other chords here's our

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.940 
can turn it into other chords here's our
G<00:06:47.040> chord<00:06:49.520> without<00:06:50.520> there

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
G chord without there

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.070 
G chord without there
I<00:06:51.980> can<00:06:52.700> very<00:06:52.910> easily<00:06:53.090> Kenny's<00:06:53.570> here<00:06:53.690> cheese

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:54.080 
I can very easily Kenny's here cheese

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:59.290 
I can very easily Kenny's here cheese
sauce<00:06:55.630> that's<00:06:56.630> for<00:06:56.900> there

00:06:59.290 --> 00:06:59.300 

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:04.890 

things<00:07:00.300> are<00:07:00.660> backing

00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:04.900 

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.740 

turning<00:07:05.620> to<00:07:05.770> a<00:07:05.800> major<00:07:06.100> seventh<00:07:06.760> by<00:07:07.120> adding<00:07:07.780> the

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:10.750 

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:19.870 

that<00:07:11.350> sharpens<00:07:12.010> the<00:07:12.070> therapy<00:07:12.700> core<00:07:12.970> and

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:19.880 

00:07:19.880 --> 00:07:26.550

00:07:38.200 --> 00:07:38.210 

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:40.480 

so<00:07:39.050> there's<00:07:39.200> a<00:07:39.230> lot<00:07:39.320> of<00:07:39.470> options<00:07:39.890> if<00:07:40.100> you<00:07:40.220> know

so there's a lot of options if you know

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:42.670 
so there's a lot of options if you know
music<00:07:41.120> theory<00:07:41.420> that<00:07:41.540> you<00:07:41.720> could<00:07:41.930> you<00:07:42.380> can<00:07:42.500> play
