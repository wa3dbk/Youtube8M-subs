breaks<00:03:23.860> apart<00:03:24.010> this<00:03:24.970> will<00:03:25.120> come<00:03:25.299> apart<00:03:25.600> but

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:25.840 
breaks apart this will come apart but

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:27.479 
breaks apart this will come apart but
it's<00:03:25.989> an<00:03:26.079> easy<00:03:26.200> it's<00:03:26.590> an<00:03:26.680> easy<00:03:26.829> rebuild<00:03:27.310> this

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
it's an easy it's an easy rebuild this

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.699 
it's an easy it's an easy rebuild this
one<00:03:27.730> piece<00:03:27.970> and<00:03:28.239> you're<00:03:28.930> back<00:03:29.140> together<00:03:29.350> again

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
one piece and you're back together again

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.890 
one piece and you're back together again
and<00:03:30.040> like<00:03:30.519> I<00:03:30.640> said<00:03:30.700> it's<00:03:30.940> a<00:03:31.000> modular<00:03:31.450> system<00:03:31.450> so

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
and like I said it's a modular system so

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.840 
and like I said it's a modular system so
you<00:03:31.989> can<00:03:32.049> take<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.410> different<00:03:32.680> pieces

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850
