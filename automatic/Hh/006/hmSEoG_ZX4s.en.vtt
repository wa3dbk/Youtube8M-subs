00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
 Hmm 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:15.710
 Well, it's a big dish today! 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:15.710
 It is a product review . It is this to say what review to do 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:22.030
 Yamaha 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.220
 It is a silent guitar acoustic version 

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:27.280
 I finally bought it 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.850
 7 years ago 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.710
 Was is my main guitar 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.590
 There is a year guitar 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.579
 This main pig's 

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.220
 Maine is famous, but not so much 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:44.310
 It's not a dream yet 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:50.400
 It's a guitar that came to Japan about three people ago but it's made in Australia 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:51.810
 It's a guitar 8 Even after practicing , even if you put a mute on the acoustic gear 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.390
 After all 4 

00:00:51.810 --> 00:01:01.590
 If you want to practice that night even if it doesn't bother your neighborhood or your neighborhood, you can sleep with family members 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:06.050
 I mean Tsu can not be still a little big time practice and sleeping to Toka or by 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.050
 I was interested in it , so this is 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.220
 This I'd had the 7 jump of demonstration 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.850
 Back it has become this 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.850
 If you take off here and take off here 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 This is 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.840
 This will take 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.140
 Well there is a case 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.670
 It folds like this 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.990
 Thin case min 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:44.360
 I will put it in place 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:48.890
 Do Well also control I convenient look is convenient to carry I'd like that feeling 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.490
 I think that I'm supposed to make eight here and I'm going to let it go straight 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.490
 With headphones 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.390
 If you can practice 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.090
 In this 7 blankets 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:03.600
 Well there is no trefle base middle normally 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:09.560
 It is unlucky is Berg to what in it is the volume in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:14.000
 I 'm going for 2 stages of 2nd month, so the head is compact like this. 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:19.819
 Well, it's a bit narrow but it's a little narrow, but the sealed string acoustic version 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:23.980
 So there is also a classic guitar version, maybe it might be your details 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.980
 It is like this in I'd This unprocessed 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.910
 ana 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 par 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.650
 It has a very good shape, so I have a neck when compared with my main akokoko day 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:48.120
 In particular, high-say thin Kana 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.870
 Some people who have finger style like me 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.870
 Kinoeyubi Oko 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.189
 Even a little narrow feeling It is not even not is you get used Baso when finger ring 

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:57.189
 I do not have 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.319
 If you can strike a little 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:23.010
 a such a thing is not it I also actually Nin at all the mimicry also here. 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:26.519
 The product I am playing is the difference I can say it at home 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:30.860
 I said 7 years since I bought it , but thanks to this guitar I get pretty good 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:37.060
 The Do and there I think by yourself 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:37.060
 Let's connected to the amplifier day par amplifier Is It Well Roland 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.700

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.700
 I'm dirty and dirty 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.470
 It does it 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:51.470
 It is an amplifier 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.700

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.150

 Hmm 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:23.590

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:25.620

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.479
 ban 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.479
 Hmm 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:13.929
 If you try the second stage, the river is further hmm 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.639
 eh 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:41.630
 It does Mase Tei 

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:43.350
 U'u de 

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.920
 pane 

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:46.920

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.920
 Hmm 

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:52.750

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.320
 Hmm 

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.320
 me 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.520
 It is very good to say it together 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:12.289
 In Live 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.289
 There are a lot of artists using 

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:17.990
 I think not live 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:23.480
 There is t increase pickup in 1 round trip 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:28.830
 It's all about it, but it's just so good balance and of course carry 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:31.670
 I'd say to to also be lighter I feel that the kana not live orientation 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.040
 Horses are energetic 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:39.030
 This is an acoustic guitar amp as an element 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:41.040
 I also use Maybe a little use I thought Atochotto and I want Birogu to use 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.920
 It may be better to 

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:49.060
 People who are just a little troubled with the noise problem 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:51.550
 Why not go to the 8 oyster shop and try it because it 's also what you buy in Kina 

00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:53.540
 I messed up and say a word Iitsu 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:56.280
