and she gave me quite their response I'm

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.440 
and she gave me quite their response I'm
very<00:00:09.150> surprised<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.650> had<00:00:10.830> nearly<00:00:11.450> 1,500

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
very surprised to have had nearly 1,500

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.289 
very surprised to have had nearly 1,500
likes<00:00:12.630> and<00:00:13.099> 1500<00:00:14.099> comments<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.759> did<00:00:14.969> not<00:00:15.120> think

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
likes and 1500 comments I did not think

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.380 
likes and 1500 comments I did not think
you<00:00:15.540> guys<00:00:15.719> were<00:00:15.900> that<00:00:16.020> active<00:00:17.000> the<00:00:18.000> overall

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
you guys were that active the overall

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.470 
you guys were that active the overall
reaction<00:00:18.510> was<00:00:19.550> majorly<00:00:20.550> positive<00:00:21.150> without

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
reaction was majorly positive without

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.310 
reaction was majorly positive without
them<00:00:21.660> 10<00:00:22.260> in<00:00:22.529> every<00:00:23.310> 11<00:00:23.580> people<00:00:24.320> reacting

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
them 10 in every 11 people reacting

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.519 
them 10 in every 11 people reacting
positively<00:00:25.470> to<00:00:25.949> it<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:28.050> I'd<00:00:28.140> love<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.380> just

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
positively to it now I'd love to just

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.140 
positively to it now I'd love to just
say<00:00:28.740> let's<00:00:29.460> get<00:00:29.640> it<00:00:29.730> started

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
say let's get it started

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.970 
say let's get it started
however<00:00:30.510> there<00:00:30.779> are<00:00:30.960> some<00:00:31.289> pretty<00:00:31.710> major

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
however there are some pretty major

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.450 
however there are some pretty major
issues<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.489> I<00:00:32.669> need<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.270> discuss<00:00:34.190> this<00:00:35.190> is

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
issues that I need to discuss this is

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.080 
issues that I need to discuss this is
grid-based<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.079> it's<00:00:37.620> composed<00:00:38.219> of<00:00:38.489> plots

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
grid-based so it's composed of plots

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.119 
grid-based so it's composed of plots
which<00:00:39.600> basically<00:00:39.960> allow<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.620> place<00:00:40.800> any

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
which basically allow you to place any

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.970 
which basically allow you to place any
type<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.340> building<00:00:41.790> on<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.570> plot<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:43.500> form<00:00:43.770> a

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
type of building on this plot to form a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.389 
type of building on this plot to form a
town<00:00:44.250> which<00:00:44.730> interacts<00:00:45.390> with<00:00:45.539> itself<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:47.250> this

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
town which interacts with itself so this

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.010 
town which interacts with itself so this
is<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.579> plot<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.300> currently<00:00:48.480> hosting

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
is a plot and it's currently hosting

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.939 
is a plot and it's currently hosting
coal<00:00:50.930> so<00:00:51.930> let's<00:00:52.170> say<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.440> argument's<00:00:52.590> sake

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
coal so let's say for argument's sake

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.279 
coal so let's say for argument's sake
that<00:00:53.190> there<00:00:53.520> are<00:00:53.760> 10<00:00:54.300> possible<00:00:54.780> structures

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
that there are 10 possible structures

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.420 
that there are 10 possible structures
that<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.489> be<00:00:56.610> placed<00:00:56.820> on<00:00:57.000> any<00:00:57.030> bobland<00:00:57.539> ok<00:00:58.430> so

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
that can be placed on any bobland ok so

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.840 
that can be placed on any bobland ok so
these<00:00:59.730> can<00:00:59.969> be<00:01:00.000> freely<00:01:00.420> removed<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:01.850> built

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
these can be freely removed and built

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.750 
these can be freely removed and built
upon<00:01:03.120> at<00:01:03.359> any<00:01:03.539> time<00:01:03.809> for<00:01:04.439> a<00:01:04.470> cost<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.549> we<00:01:05.580> can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
upon at any time for a cost so we can

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.120 
upon at any time for a cost so we can
remove<00:01:05.970> that<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.990> can<00:01:07.830> build<00:01:07.950> something

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
remove that I can build something

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.210 
remove that I can build something
completely<00:01:08.580> new<00:01:09.619> career<00:01:10.619> that<00:01:10.770> if<00:01:10.950> we<00:01:11.070> don't

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
completely new career that if we don't

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.570 
completely new career that if we don't
want<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:11.939> we<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.540> also<00:01:13.189> build<00:01:14.189> something

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
want it and we can also build something

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.350 
want it and we can also build something
entirely<00:01:14.850> else<00:01:15.180> as<00:01:15.570> well<00:01:15.900> such<00:01:16.560> as<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> house

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.360 
entirely else as well such as the house

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.620 
entirely else as well such as the house
so<00:01:18.360> this<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.780> actually<00:01:19.110> probably<00:01:19.920> the<00:01:20.189> biggest

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
so this is actually probably the biggest

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.999 
so this is actually probably the biggest
problem<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.960> whole<00:01:22.080> thing<00:01:22.350> problem

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
problem with the whole thing problem

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.850 
problem with the whole thing problem
number<00:01:23.250> one<00:01:23.810> let's<00:01:24.810> say<00:01:24.990> to<00:01:25.049> be<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> little<00:01:25.740> bit

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
number one let's say to be a little bit

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.990 
number one let's say to be a little bit
more<00:01:25.950> realistic<00:01:26.310> that<00:01:26.369> there<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:26.759> 100

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
more realistic that there are 100

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.590 
more realistic that there are 100
possible<00:01:27.810> building<00:01:28.470> types<00:01:28.710> ok<00:01:29.220> so<00:01:30.180> each<00:01:30.299> plot

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
possible building types ok so each plot

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.560 
possible building types ok so each plot
has<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.829> possibility<00:01:32.340> of<00:01:32.369> hosting<00:01:32.670> one<00:01:33.540> of

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
has the possibility of hosting one of

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.499 
has the possibility of hosting one of
100<00:01:34.200> building<00:01:34.799> types<00:01:35.119> now<00:01:36.119> if<00:01:36.210> you<00:01:36.299> can<00:01:36.390> count

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
100 building types now if you can count

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.920 
100 building types now if you can count
there<00:01:36.720> are<00:01:36.750> 64<00:01:37.380> plots<00:01:37.680> here<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.299> 64<00:01:39.299> times<00:01:39.509> 100

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
there are 64 plots here and 64 times 100

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.010 
there are 64 plots here and 64 times 100
is<00:01:40.049> six<00:01:40.350> thousand<00:01:40.829> four<00:01:41.189> hundred<00:01:42.020> six

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
is six thousand four hundred six

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.160 
is six thousand four hundred six
thousand<00:01:43.590> four<00:01:43.799> hundred<00:01:44.009> unique

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
thousand four hundred unique

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.480 
thousand four hundred unique
possibilities<00:01:46.170> basically<00:01:46.890> there<00:01:47.280> is<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.399> lot

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
possibilities basically there is a lot

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.530 
possibilities basically there is a lot
of<00:01:48.090> possibilities<00:01:50.000> Amala<00:01:51.000> knows<00:01:51.180> this<00:01:51.360> but

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
of possibilities Amala knows this but

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.789 
of possibilities Amala knows this but
each<00:01:51.860> plot<00:01:52.860> each<00:01:53.250> structure<00:01:53.700> has<00:01:54.799> four

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
each plot each structure has four

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:56.840 
each plot each structure has four
spawner

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
spawner

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.709 
spawner
so<00:01:57.090> -<00:01:58.280> static<00:01:59.280> spawn<00:01:59.520> ism<00:01:59.759> -<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.210> god<00:02:00.360> spawn<00:02:00.570> is

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
so - static spawn ism - my god spawn is

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.389 
so - static spawn ism - my god spawn is
and<00:02:00.930> that's<00:02:01.049> just<00:02:01.259> an<00:02:01.350> idle<00:02:01.770> state<00:02:01.799> there<00:02:02.159> even

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
and that's just an idle state there even

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.550 
and that's just an idle state there even
a<00:02:02.670> lot<00:02:03.149> more<00:02:03.450> while<00:02:04.290> they're<00:02:04.409> actually

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
a lot more while they're actually

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
a lot more while they're actually
running<00:02:04.829> so<00:02:05.280> that's<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:07.039> 24,000<00:02:08.039> Spooner's

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
running so that's about 24,000 Spooner's

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.260 
running so that's about 24,000 Spooner's
well<00:02:08.729> more<00:02:08.849> than<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.060> 24,000<00:02:09.899> spawn<00:02:10.080> is

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
well more than that 24,000 spawn is

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.540 
well more than that 24,000 spawn is
just<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.140> whole<00:02:12.260> thing<00:02:12.290> now<00:02:13.250> that<00:02:13.400> would

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
just the whole thing now that would

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.670 
just the whole thing now that would
create<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:14.000> hell<00:02:14.390> of<00:02:14.420> a<00:02:14.600> lot<00:02:14.720> of<00:02:14.810> lag<00:02:15.020> and<00:02:15.230> is

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:15.680 
create a hell of a lot of lag and is

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.200 
create a hell of a lot of lag and is
probably<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.160> of<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.340> biggest<00:02:16.820> problems

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
probably one of the biggest problems

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.320 
probably one of the biggest problems
here<00:02:17.530> problem<00:02:18.530> number<00:02:18.920> two<00:02:20.140> logic<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.460> don't

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
here problem number two logic so I don't

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.210 
here problem number two logic so I don't
want<00:02:23.480> this<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:25.190> basically<00:02:25.370> be<00:02:26.260> static<00:02:27.260> the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
want this to basically be static the

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.000 
want this to basically be static the
static<00:02:28.250> structures<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.510> do<00:02:30.380> things<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:30.800> want

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
static structures that do things I want

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:32.290 
static structures that do things I want
there<00:02:31.130> to<00:02:31.160> be<00:02:31.250> some<00:02:31.430> interaction<00:02:31.760> between

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
there to be some interaction between

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.380 
there to be some interaction between
things<00:02:33.170> logic<00:02:33.710> basically<00:02:33.890> so<00:02:34.850> let's<00:02:35.060> say<00:02:35.240> we

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
things logic basically so let's say we

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.420 
things logic basically so let's say we
have<00:02:35.570> a<00:02:35.600> learning<00:02:36.440> organization<00:02:37.250> that<00:02:37.370> we

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
have a learning organization that we

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.430 
have a learning organization that we
place<00:02:37.580> on<00:02:37.730> a<00:02:37.820> certain<00:02:38.060> plot<00:02:38.330> now<00:02:39.170> what<00:02:39.320> this

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
place on a certain plot now what this

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.740 
place on a certain plot now what this
organization<00:02:39.890> does<00:02:40.310> is<00:02:40.610> basically<00:02:40.820> if<00:02:41.300> paste

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
organization does is basically if paste

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.890 
organization does is basically if paste
were<00:02:42.140> within<00:02:42.500> the<00:02:42.650> vicinity<00:02:43.070> of<00:02:43.100> AWS<00:02:43.910> it<00:02:44.570> mines

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
were within the vicinity of AWS it mines

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.410 
were within the vicinity of AWS it mines
them<00:02:45.170> and<00:02:45.350> adds<00:02:45.740> that<00:02:45.830> to<00:02:46.160> the<00:02:46.370> town<00:02:47.000> supply

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
them and adds that to the town supply

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:53.320 
them and adds that to the town supply
talk<00:02:47.720> pause<00:02:50.260> so<00:02:51.260> with<00:02:52.160> the<00:02:52.340> towns<00:02:52.550> suppose

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
talk pause so with the towns suppose

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.200 
talk pause so with the towns suppose
always<00:02:53.720> very<00:02:53.930> high<00:02:54.110> we<00:02:54.920> have<00:02:55.160> a<00:02:55.430> blacksmith<00:02:56.090> in

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:56.210 
always very high we have a blacksmith in

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.820 
always very high we have a blacksmith in
the<00:02:56.330> town<00:02:56.540> which<00:02:56.810> basically<00:02:57.290> converts<00:02:57.680> were

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
the town which basically converts were

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.160 
the town which basically converts were
those<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.460> weapons<00:02:58.850> which<00:02:59.330> is<00:02:59.360> then<00:02:59.840> taken

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
those into weapons which is then taken

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:04.240 
those into weapons which is then taken
to<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.380> market<00:03:01.010> which<00:03:01.430> is<00:03:01.580> sold<00:03:01.820> for<00:03:02.390> money<00:03:03.250> now

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
to a market which is sold for money now

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.310 
to a market which is sold for money now
this<00:03:04.460> sounds<00:03:05.210> very<00:03:05.300> cool<00:03:05.570> and<00:03:05.900> there'd<00:03:06.200> be<00:03:06.260> a

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
this sounds very cool and there'd be a

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.050 
this sounds very cool and there'd be a
lot<00:03:06.500> more<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.770> it<00:03:06.830> than<00:03:06.950> that<00:03:07.040> it's<00:03:07.640> very

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
lot more to it than that it's very

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.020 
lot more to it than that it's very
ambitious<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:09.550> the<00:03:10.550> fact<00:03:10.760> that<00:03:10.820> it's<00:03:11.000> very

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
ambitious and the fact that it's very

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.020 
ambitious and the fact that it's very
ambitious<00:03:11.180> is<00:03:11.570> the<00:03:11.690> problem<00:03:11.960> here<00:03:13.030> basically

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
ambitious is the problem here basically

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.290 
ambitious is the problem here basically
given<00:03:14.750> giving<00:03:15.440> the<00:03:15.830> player<00:03:16.040> so<00:03:16.310> much<00:03:16.489> freedom

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
given giving the player so much freedom

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.729 
given giving the player so much freedom
of<00:03:17.420> placement<00:03:17.900> basically<00:03:18.410> means<00:03:18.650> that

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
of placement basically means that

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:22.449 
of placement basically means that
there's<00:03:19.630> probably<00:03:20.630> a<00:03:20.720> limitless<00:03:21.140> number<00:03:22.130> of

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
there's probably a limitless number of

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.240 
there's probably a limitless number of
combinations<00:03:23.300> of<00:03:23.830> buildings<00:03:24.830> being<00:03:25.040> placed

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
combinations of buildings being placed

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.160 
combinations of buildings being placed
everywhere<00:03:25.580> so<00:03:25.730> without<00:03:26.120> severely<00:03:26.510> limiting

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
everywhere so without severely limiting

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.010 
everywhere so without severely limiting
the<00:03:27.610> players<00:03:29.890> placement<00:03:30.890> of<00:03:31.010> structures<00:03:32.020> it

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
the players placement of structures it

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:36.540 
the players placement of structures it
would<00:03:33.170> basically<00:03:33.380> be<00:03:33.650> an<00:03:33.920> impossible<00:03:34.520> task<00:03:34.730> to

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
would basically be an impossible task to

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.400 
would basically be an impossible task to
not<00:03:37.550> really<00:03:37.730> code<00:03:37.910> but<00:03:38.180> code<00:03:38.450> all<00:03:38.750> the<00:03:38.780> the

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
not really code but code all the the

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:42.430 
not really code but code all the the
logic<00:03:39.860> of<00:03:39.890> how<00:03:40.130> each<00:03:41.030> structure<00:03:41.780> interacts

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:42.440 
logic of how each structure interacts

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.560 
logic of how each structure interacts
with<00:03:42.590> another<00:03:42.860> structure<00:03:43.250> in<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:43.430> world<00:03:43.640> now

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:44.570 
with another structure in the world now

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:45.670 
with another structure in the world now
it<00:03:44.720> might<00:03:44.840> be<00:03:44.900> possible<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.410> might<00:03:45.590> be

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
it might be possible I might be

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.620 
it might be possible I might be
overlooking<00:03:46.040> something<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.730> people<00:03:47.510> might

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
overlooking something and people might

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.600 
overlooking something and people might
be<00:03:47.720> tearing<00:03:47.989> out<00:03:48.140> no<00:03:48.620> it's<00:03:48.860> really<00:03:49.250> really

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
be tearing out no it's really really

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:54.280 
be tearing out no it's really really
obvious<00:03:50.800> but<00:03:51.800> I<00:03:52.100> can't<00:03:53.060> see<00:03:53.360> away<00:03:53.660> on<00:03:54.019> doing

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
obvious but I can't see away on doing

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.530 
obvious but I can't see away on doing
that<00:03:54.380> in<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.650> simple<00:03:55.220> in<00:03:55.910> a<00:03:56.090> simple<00:03:56.450> way<00:03:56.510> that

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
that in a simple in a simple way that

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.810 
that in a simple in a simple way that
wouldn't<00:03:57.140> be<00:03:57.260> ridiculously<00:03:58.190> complicated<00:03:58.519> to

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
wouldn't be ridiculously complicated to

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.300 
wouldn't be ridiculously complicated to
do<00:03:59.030> now<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.050> know<00:04:00.170> it<00:04:00.350> was<00:04:00.470> me<00:04:00.650> who<00:04:00.830> suggested

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
do now I know it was me who suggested

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.460 
do now I know it was me who suggested
this<00:04:01.459> whole<00:04:01.700> thing<00:04:01.940> but<00:04:02.300> I<00:04:02.630> think<00:04:03.140> I'm<00:04:03.230> trying

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
this whole thing but I think I'm trying

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.500 
this whole thing but I think I'm trying
to<00:04:03.560> bite<00:04:03.709> off<00:04:03.860> more<00:04:04.100> than<00:04:04.160> I<00:04:04.370> can<00:04:04.430> chew<00:04:04.610> that

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
to bite off more than I can chew that

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.060 
to bite off more than I can chew that
combined<00:04:05.900> with<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.080> fact<00:04:06.110> that<00:04:06.320> the<00:04:06.530> idea<00:04:06.680> is

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
combined with the fact that the idea is

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.830 
combined with the fact that the idea is
constantly<00:04:07.580> evolving<00:04:07.970> up<00:04:08.480> until<00:04:08.750> a<00:04:08.810> point

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
constantly evolving up until a point

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.900 
constantly evolving up until a point
that<00:04:09.260> it's<00:04:09.440> not<00:04:09.560> even<00:04:09.920> the<00:04:10.070> same<00:04:10.100> idea<00:04:10.670> that<00:04:10.850> it

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
that it's not even the same idea that it

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.990 
that it's not even the same idea that it
was<00:04:11.090> when<00:04:11.510> it<00:04:11.630> begun<00:04:12.459> also<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.489> don't<00:04:13.700> really

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
was when it begun also I don't really

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.970 
was when it begun also I don't really
want<00:04:14.150> to<00:04:14.180> strip<00:04:14.540> people<00:04:15.019> of<00:04:15.260> what's<00:04:15.800> great

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
want to strip people of what's great

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.080 
want to strip people of what's great
about<00:04:16.070> my<00:04:16.310> own<00:04:16.370> car<00:04:16.549> if<00:04:16.640> you<00:04:16.730> have<00:04:16.790> to<00:04:16.910> build

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
about my own car if you have to build

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.690 
about my own car if you have to build
things<00:04:17.330> and<00:04:17.979> obviously<00:04:18.979> you're<00:04:19.370> building

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
things and obviously you're building

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.710 
things and obviously you're building
things<00:04:19.880> be<00:04:20.060> it's<00:04:20.239> not<00:04:20.330> what<00:04:20.450> you're<00:04:20.570> building

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
things be it's not what you're building

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.240 
things be it's not what you're building
they're<00:04:21.080> just<00:04:21.229> predetermine<00:04:21.770> structures<00:04:22.130> and

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
they're just predetermine structures and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.500 
they're just predetermine structures and
I<00:04:22.280> don't<00:04:22.490> really<00:04:22.640> like<00:04:22.820> that

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
I don't really like that

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:25.600 
I don't really like that
so<00:04:24.080> what<00:04:24.620> I<00:04:24.650> might<00:04:24.890> take<00:04:25.070> some<00:04:25.130> things<00:04:25.520> from

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
so what I might take some things from

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.400 
so what I might take some things from
this<00:04:25.790> I<00:04:26.030> don't<00:04:26.330> think<00:04:26.570> I'll<00:04:26.660> be<00:04:26.750> doing<00:04:26.960> this

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
this I don't think I'll be doing this

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.630 
this I don't think I'll be doing this
exact<00:04:27.920> map<00:04:28.280> in<00:04:29.180> a<00:04:29.240> series
