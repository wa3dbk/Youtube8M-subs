00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
like I do as far as protection it should

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.690 
like I do as far as protection it should
handle<00:01:51.300> a<00:01:51.480> not<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.290> high<00:01:52.560> drop<00:01:53.010> if<00:01:53.310> it's

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
handle a not so high drop if it's

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.960 
handle a not so high drop if it's
dropped<00:01:54.030> on<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.270> angle<00:01:55.580> you're<00:01:56.580> screwed

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
dropped on the angle you're screwed

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.630 
dropped on the angle you're screwed
because<00:01:57.510> you<00:01:58.440> know<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.770> if<00:01:58.980> it<00:01:59.250> falls<00:01:59.430> flat

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
because you know it if it falls flat

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.510 
because you know it if it falls flat
down<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.510> that<00:02:00.720> is<00:02:00.960> fine<00:02:01.290> but<00:02:01.650> if<00:02:02.190> it<00:02:02.310> drops

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
down like that is fine but if it drops

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.310 
down like that is fine but if it drops
on<00:02:02.760> the<00:02:02.850> angle<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.390> hits<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:04.080> rock<00:02:04.290> or

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
on the angle and hits a rock or

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.190 
on the angle and hits a rock or
something<00:02:04.560> then<00:02:05.240> there's<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:06.510> much<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.810> can
