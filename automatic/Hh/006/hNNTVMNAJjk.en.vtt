00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
as well as the light ones so you're

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.410 
as well as the light ones so you're

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
sealing can work to seal a tubular but

sealing can work to seal a tubular but
really<00:01:51.149> only<00:01:51.270> works<00:01:51.600> well<00:01:51.840> on<00:01:51.869> clementé<00:01:52.560> or
