 so of course there are the passages of 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.239
 dungeons so what is called the 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.339
 mercenary 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.800

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.290
 that we use to do kamas I 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.299

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.159
 this quest was done on the spot 30 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.140
 not very long ago so you have to 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.299
 beforehand have finished the quest a 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 volcano goes off to realize it 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.320
 actually is to craft an amulet and 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.360

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.759
 turn it into amulets and mentaries 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.590

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.159
 anyway I'm going to do the quest in 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.310
 same time that I'm talking to you about my 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.109
 khama trick that will interest us the 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.140
 especially these are the fragments that are 

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.539
 needed for kraft this hamlet there 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.899

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:46.869
 water that must be assembled with the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:49.369
 crusher workshop forgemagie 

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.619
 to get the four stones of 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.359
 each item that will be next 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.090
 crafter by a jeweler to do the 

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.679
 mule is these fragments then we 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.109
 find where we can find them in the 

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:01.999
 blocks of ice from the dungeon dungeon and 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:03.969
 more recently also in the blocks of 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:08.450
 Frost Theme Dungeon Ice Need 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:10.080
 there is also a quest with an object 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 drop abl sure 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.880
 monsters type manceaux have little 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.220
 drop is a vibrant feather that 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.930
 can be exchanged for 1 ap the cube and 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.630
 it is in these cube confessions that we can 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:25.050
 sometimes find out if you're lucky 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:27.360
 fragments so these fragments can be 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.930
 read sell between 2 and 4 million in 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:32.700
 anyway on my server and more 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.190
 they are rare more necessarily their price 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.190
 will go up it is not uncommon 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.660
 to see people from other servers nor 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:41.910
 gray to come buy some fragments or 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.010
 people from our server go on 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.650
 other servers for it's part of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.450
 sight with so it's even trade 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:50.250
 inter servers I want to say 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.250
 regarding the resale of 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.500
 fragments then you have several 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.180
 possibilities to make tote bags 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 while remaining a link with this quest 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.440
 so you can sell the fragments to 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.500
 Unit I say between 2 and 4 million 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:07.290
 you can also sell the amulet 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:10.200
 luxury land magnet that you will have to 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.090
 the outcome of which she is enough 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.260
 sought for its multi- element side 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.840
 but mostly because it gives a 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.370
 title grand master of the elements and for 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:19.920
 collectors in general this kind 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:22.230
 of things we like to wear so we 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.350
 can easily sell this hamlet in 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:27.780
 the 65 million or so if you want 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:30.450
 you make a maximum of kama you have 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.810
 the possibility of kraft just the bezel 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.940
 and nanterre that will serve for success 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.860
 given that you give a little bit 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.450
 turnkey success because the 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.890
 fragments are all there is no 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:43.320
 need to buy them individually 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.120
 I think we can finish in the 80s 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.640
 million in any case saw the prices on a 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:50.130
 waiter that's what we can ask 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.590
 to nurse amulets like this 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:54.870
 again it still depends a lot of 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:58.170
 price of your server but in all 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.150
 case it remains a profitable way to 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.680
 to make kamas for the little that you 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.820
 have a team capable of generating 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.920
 manceaux so we can say that it is 

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.250
 still accessible to just about anything 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.830
 the world 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.230
 so that was the first tip 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:11.910
 kama I told you about the 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.620
 chain but there will be others 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.810
 today still another one in any case 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.060
 for the moment 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:19.190
 in reserve that I prepare you for very 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.480
 soon if you have questions 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.250
 do not hesitate to leave me a 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:24.500
 comment and I will try to answer it 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:26.030
 on this I tell you next and we 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.360
 finds himself very quickly for a new 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.360
 video
