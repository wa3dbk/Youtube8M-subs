00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 doctor jal si of girl and a helmet 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.230
 similar to the noble 6 there is no 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.300
 official synopsis but the name of the 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.980
 novel and the cover image gives us a 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.200
 track what is part of the plot 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.850
 mortal dictates is a law or code of 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.530
 ethics that strictly prohibits 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.039
 cloning of flash of humans 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.870
 the law came into force at 2,549 per 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.699
 Unfortunately, Dr. Joel did break the 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.770
 law when he created cutting as he did the 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.480
 cloning method in it the image 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.369
 He also shows us the doctor so 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.659
 an important part of the plot is 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.030
 will develop based on the side 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.979
 yes and its war crimes history 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.390
 in general the trilogy has a relationship 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.979
 direct with the saga of the declaimer 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.840
 also the situation does not turn 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.579
 JAL completely around if you also 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.679
 focuses all issues such as civil war 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:21.689
 in blood or the inquisitor the secrets 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.549
 of the UN technology findings 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.200
 football fan and other things so there will be 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.030
 many revelations that this will bring 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.950
 new book one of them could be the 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.319
 mysterious subject that we saw in the intro 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.209
 of halo 4 is part of the staff of the 

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.039
 hour and interrogate the doctor hole yes 

00:01:33.209 --> 00:01:36.959
 but his face is never revealed and it seems 

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:39.179
 have a future within the saga as 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:40.799
 possible antagonist on the part of the un 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:42.810
 may in this book reveal more 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.819
 about this subject besides that 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.649
 surely will offer more information 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.360
 other characters like Lord good and the 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.520
 inquisitor changing the subject the 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.860
 comic-con de san diego is already close that 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.420
 will be held from July 18 to 20 and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.429
 microsoft will be present in different 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.469
 panels and conferences where they will offer 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.950
 more information about his games and the ex 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.140
 mutual 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.270
 during the event they will show more details 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.829
 about the Spartans out glances 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.719
 exclusives of the game and your amount and 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.609
 he will also be present although I doubt 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.530
 much that reveal halo information 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:12.299
 for xbox one since they refuse to say 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.710
 something until the next 3 can be 

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:15.570
 almost certainly we will have 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.640
 Details of the new TV series 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.800
 of ice directed by steven spielberg 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.540
 it's quite logical since in the comicon 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.340
 some series are also shown 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.470
 successful television like the walking 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.540
 dead and game of thrones so although not 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.460
 is confirmed we can expect to see more 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.620
 information and a possible trailer of the 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.450
 series those who attend the event may 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.220
 try the new package for the first time 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.020
