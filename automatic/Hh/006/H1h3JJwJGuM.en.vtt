00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:06.670
 faces of the shadows of the atmospheres 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.410
 dreamlike daoud has always had a 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.060
 attraction to painting since his 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:11.110
 younger age 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:13.390
 after being forced to study 

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.830
 the hospitality the call of this art comes back 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.570
 to him and he enters the national school 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.310
 decorative arts of paris 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:22.260
 then the need to paint is like 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:27.869
 to drink and eat is a vocation 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:31.750
 we are slaves of 7.7 science a moment 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:35.229
 it is we are the body and the spirit 

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.089
 and the tool of this science actually 

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:39.129
 it's as if a city is waiting 

00:00:37.089 --> 00:00:42.760
 that passion takes us takes us 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:46.600
 to be able to work to paint express 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.940
 our ideas me source of inspiration she 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.499
 is infinity and that's a chance to 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.659
 to be able to paint like that I am 

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:54.999
 conscious already because sometimes it's okay 

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:56.109
 I will not need to look for anything 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.989
 it is to work I work of 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:00.429
 Memory fantasy and imagination 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.100
 doubt of the draw in the literature 

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:05.290
 in mythology in the history of 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.040
 these two countries and especially in music 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 I mainly paint in music 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.260
 so I'm a fan of music 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.150
 my passion is music is the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.840
 painting I am painting the bread 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.640
 but despite everything I try to express 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 my ideas in the web so I need 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.800
 to escape I would like the music 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:31.120
 transcends and transforms ideas 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.290
 serene on a surface from there on 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.630
 is one is like me I work from 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.430
 memory so I'm starting to have some 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.440
 flashes of inspiration in 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.480
 the inspiration cdl you will show me on 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.000
 the ride on you and then here you are 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:47.530
 dominated by that it's forced to work 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.000
 then when we get in trouble after all 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.410
 puts up in our mind actually 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.710
 yeah it's like a veil to that 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:02:00.400
 envisioned the envi it ​​is controlled at this 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.810
 how to say it is not necessary anyway 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:06.370
 tea against her in fact so then here it is 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.170
 so I let myself be guided like that with 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.670
 com music and this music is 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.850
 in his memories of his country of origin 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.770
 lebanon that daoud the puise what makes 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.080
 as badly 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:20.770
 my job is being 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.790
 from Beirut from Beirut so has 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:28.030
 always this nostalgia his smells his 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:30.880
 sounds see there is sound and sounds 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.550
 to that of sound but silence is 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.959
 also the name of all it is are 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:40.100
 sounds the two judges and mans where there has been 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:42.410
 a silence a total silence 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.720
 another major source of inspiration from 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:45.980
 painter women his paintings are the 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.650
 most of the time his trait on a 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:50.900
 main female character the end but 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 represent them and we feel that there is 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.670
 a woman then after others 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.200
 characters and there the character is a 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.810
 main character but I put them in 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.250
 withdrawal so that I put it back 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.410
 compared to others are a little 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.230
 blurred so that the viewer can 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.420
 look at this character who what created 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.310
 the title is actually the story of the 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:15.340
 chart so here and then after all these 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:17.570
 characters are a bit blurry it 's 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.000
 characters who are on top of each other 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:24.380
 then we have to talk there is silence 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.080
 and the whispers and then so here 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:28.910
 you see it's the immensity of the framing 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:31.550
 and compared to the character of whom there is 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.830
 always a ladder of but always the 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.450
 character in a ladder and in 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.490
 the space to showcase it 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:40.280
 so people can imagine some 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:42.620
 thing and then give perspective 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.750
 and depth on the board actually 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.580
 daoud has won many awards and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.520
 especially the first prize frédéric ii 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:51.170

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.880

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:54.880
