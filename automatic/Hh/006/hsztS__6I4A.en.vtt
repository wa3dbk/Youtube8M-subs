00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
they just stay I mean way out in the

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.900 
they just stay I mean way out in the
universe<00:04:53.350> someplace<00:04:53.890> when<00:04:54.100> we<00:04:54.160> do<00:04:54.310> find<00:04:54.610> life

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:54.910 
universe someplace when we do find life

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.760 
universe someplace when we do find life
they're<00:04:55.390> not<00:04:55.570> going<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:55.840> be<00:04:55.990> sending<00:04:56.530> their

children to school or they might not but

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.450 
children to school or they might not but
they<00:04:58.900> learned<00:04:59.140> from<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.440> past<00:04:59.620> as<00:04:59.950> opposed<00:05:00.280> to

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
they learned from the past as opposed to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.270 
they learned from the past as opposed to
Rian's<00:05:01.330> of<00:05:01.510> today<00:05:01.780> we<00:05:02.170> didn't<00:05:02.680> we<00:05:02.800> aren't

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
Rian's of today we didn't we aren't

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.680 
Rian's of today we didn't we aren't
learning<00:05:03.430> from<00:05:03.760> our<00:05:03.850> past<00:05:04.090> and<00:05:04.300> they<00:05:04.420> did

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:04.690
