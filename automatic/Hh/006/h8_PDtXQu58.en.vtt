will get scratched up fairly easily but

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.790 
will get scratched up fairly easily but
the<00:00:45.210> headphones<00:00:45.600> do<00:00:45.780> seem<00:00:46.050> well<00:00:46.350> built<00:00:46.590> they

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the headphones do seem well built they

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380 
the headphones do seem well built they
fold<00:00:47.129> flat<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.760> they<00:00:47.850> come<00:00:48.030> with<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.180> nice

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
couple of different cords the cord is

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.420 
couple of different cords the cord is
detachable<00:00:53.489> and<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.600> do<00:00:54.809> get<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.350> cord<00:00:56.190> with<00:00:56.250> an

inline<00:00:56.879> remote<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.449> microphone<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.199> can

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
inline remote and microphone so you can

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.099 
inline remote and microphone so you can
make<00:00:58.680> cell<00:00:58.980> phone<00:00:59.219> calls<00:00:59.520> like<00:01:00.270> other<00:01:00.600> noise

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
make cell phone calls like other noise

cancelling<00:01:23.040> headphones<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.610> when<00:01:23.850> you

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cancelling headphones is that when you

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.039 
cancelling headphones is that when you
do<00:01:24.119> put<00:01:24.330> sound<00:01:24.630> through<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.900> noise

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
do put sound through that noise

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
that are able to do it better like bose

headphones<00:01:37.860> the<00:01:38.369> good<00:01:38.520> news<00:01:38.700> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:38.939> that

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
headphones the good news here is that

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.670 
headphones the good news here is that
you<00:01:39.180> can<00:01:39.509> listen<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.930> these<00:01:40.140> with<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> noise

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
you can listen to these with the noise

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.920 
you can listen to these with the noise
cancelling<00:01:41.100> off<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.369> they<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:41.610> sound<00:01:42.479> better

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
cancelling off and they do sound better

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.020 
cancelling off and they do sound better

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
with the noise cancelling off not sure

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.050 
with the noise cancelling off not sure
exactly<00:01:45.540> why<00:01:45.960> you<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.259> buy<00:01:46.500> them<00:01:47.060> except

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
exactly why you would buy them except

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
exactly why you would buy them except
for<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> noise<00:01:48.450> cancelling<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> can<00:01:50.040> do

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
for the noise cancelling but you can do

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.130 
for the noise cancelling but you can do
that<00:01:50.369> which<00:01:50.549> is<00:01:50.729> nice<00:01:50.939> so<00:01:51.240> there's<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.840> lot<00:01:52.020> to

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
that which is nice so there's a lot to

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.660 
that which is nice so there's a lot to
like<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> there<00:01:52.560> are<00:01:52.590> some<00:01:52.860> other<00:01:53.100> models<00:01:53.549> out

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
like you there are some other models out

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.149 
like you there are some other models out
there<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.180> creative<00:01:54.600> hn<00:01:55.290> 900<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.040> are

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
there like the creative hn 900 that are

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.609 
there like the creative hn 900 that are
very<00:01:56.700> similar<00:01:57.090> looking<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.899> does<00:01:58.259> seem<00:01:58.590> a

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
very similar looking this does seem a

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.630 
very similar looking this does seem a
little<00:01:58.710> bit<00:01:58.890> better<00:01:59.100> than<00:01:59.310> that

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
little bit better than that

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.760 
little bit better than that
it<00:01:59.759> does<00:02:00.119> have<00:02:00.299> memory<00:02:00.750> foam<00:02:00.780> in<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.380> ear<00:02:01.530> cups

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
it does have memory foam in the ear cups

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:02.840 
it does have memory foam in the ear cups
and<00:02:01.920> just<00:02:02.100> seems<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.610> bit<00:02:02.700> more

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
and just seems a little bit more

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.389 
and just seems a little bit more
sturdily<00:02:03.180> built<00:02:03.259> but<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.530> creative<00:02:05.130> model

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
sturdily built but that creative model

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.080 
sturdily built but that creative model
is<00:02:05.689> around<00:02:06.799> $65<00:02:07.799> online<00:02:08.160> so<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.879> worth

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
is around $65 online so it is worth

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
is around $65 online so it is worth
checking<00:02:09.390> out<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:10.289> real<00:02:10.440> question<00:02:10.739> is

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
checking out the real question is

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.260 
checking out the real question is
whether<00:02:10.979> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.520> buy<00:02:11.670> a<00:02:11.700> pair<00:02:12.239> of

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
whether you want to buy a pair of

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.880 
whether you want to buy a pair of
headphones<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.840> clearly<00:02:13.230> isn't

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
headphones that clearly isn't

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
headphones that clearly isn't
as<00:02:13.950> good<00:02:14.340> as<00:02:14.610> some<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:14.940> those<00:02:15.090> more<00:02:15.630> expensive

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
as good as some of those more expensive

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.860 
as good as some of those more expensive
models<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.890> cost<00:02:17.310> close<00:02:18.120> to<00:02:18.330> a<00:02:18.360> third<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:18.720> the

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
models but cost close to a third of the

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.590 
models but cost close to a third of the
price<00:02:19.140> so<00:02:19.950> you're<00:02:20.069> getting<00:02:20.250> about<00:02:20.480> 70%<00:02:21.480> of<00:02:21.510> the

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
price so you're getting about 70% of the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.330 
price so you're getting about 70% of the
headphone<00:02:21.959> both<00:02:22.410> in<00:02:22.530> terms<00:02:22.740> of<00:02:22.890> its<00:02:23.040> design

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
headphone both in terms of its design

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.990 
headphone both in terms of its design
and<00:02:23.940> its<00:02:24.120> sound<00:02:24.569> quality<00:02:25.170> and<00:02:25.950> for<00:02:26.760> some

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
and its sound quality and for some

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.940 
and its sound quality and for some
people<00:02:27.120> that<00:02:27.600> will<00:02:28.050> be<00:02:28.230> good<00:02:28.410> enough<00:02:28.560> for

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
people that will be good enough for

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.540 
people that will be good enough for
others<00:02:29.670> that<00:02:30.240> 30%<00:02:30.770> will<00:02:31.770> be<00:02:31.890> worth<00:02:32.070> paying<00:02:32.430> the

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
others that 30% will be worth paying the

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:35.240 
others that 30% will be worth paying the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500
