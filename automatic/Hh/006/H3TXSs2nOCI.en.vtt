00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
the process is actually to make the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.429 
the process is actually to make the
machine<00:01:02.280> upside<00:01:02.789> down<00:01:03.090> so<00:01:03.780> I'm<00:01:04.110> going<00:01:04.260> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
right here it's got a nut behind it

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.840 
right here it's got a nut behind it
which<00:01:25.080> is<00:01:25.110> why<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.409> need<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> wrench<00:01:25.890> also<00:01:26.400> you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
which is why you need a wrench also you

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210 
which is why you need a wrench also you
know<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.030> wrenches<00:01:27.390> would<00:01:27.659> do<00:01:27.840> just<00:01:28.220> really

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
know two wrenches would do just really

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.399 
know two wrenches would do just really
that<00:01:29.430> use<00:01:29.700> a<00:01:29.729> second<00:01:30.299> round<00:01:30.570> match<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.259> makes

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
that use a second round match it makes

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.160 
that use a second round match it makes
it<00:01:31.560> easy<00:01:31.740> now<00:01:32.790> there's<00:01:33.150> nut<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> washer<00:01:33.810> on

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it easy now there's nut and a washer on

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.499 
it easy now there's nut and a washer on
there<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.590> maybe<00:01:35.220> a<00:01:35.460> man<00:01:35.700> try<00:01:35.939> to<00:01:35.970> stop<00:01:36.270> and<00:01:36.450> get

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
there so maybe a man try to stop and get

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:38.030 
there so maybe a man try to stop and get
it<00:01:36.570> off<00:01:36.689> with<00:01:36.810> your<00:01:36.869> hand<00:01:37.140> otherwise<00:01:37.860> it's

it for you it's one volt but if you just
get<00:02:19.519> a<00:02:19.549> 10<00:02:19.760> millimeter<00:02:20.000> remove<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.900> brake

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
get a 10 millimeter remove the brake

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.839 
get a 10 millimeter remove the brake
cable<00:02:21.260> if<00:02:21.560> you<00:02:21.890> are<00:02:22.010> replacing<00:02:22.250> the<00:02:22.489> brakes<00:02:22.700> if

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:22.849 
cable if you are replacing the brakes if

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:24.520 
cable if you are replacing the brakes if
you're<00:02:23.000> not<00:02:23.150> using<00:02:23.629> the<00:02:23.780> same<00:02:23.810> brake<00:02:24.140> you<00:02:24.260> just

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
you're not using the same brake you just

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.190 
you're not using the same brake you just
slip<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.189> brake<00:02:25.370> off<00:02:25.579> and<00:02:26.510> that's<00:02:26.720> it<00:02:26.840> put<00:02:27.140> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
slip the brake off and that's it put it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.539 
slip the brake off and that's it put it
back<00:02:27.319> together<00:02:27.500> it's<00:02:27.829> basically<00:02:28.189> the<00:02:28.370> same

00:02:28.539 --> 00:02:28.549 
back together it's basically the same

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.089 
back together it's basically the same
process<00:02:28.760> in<00:02:29.120> Reverse<00:02:29.530> more<00:02:30.530> coming<00:02:30.799> here<00:02:30.950> so

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
process in Reverse more coming here so

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.429 
process in Reverse more coming here so
much<00:02:31.310> easier<00:02:31.819> when<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:32.840> put<00:02:33.019> the<00:02:33.109> rear<00:02:33.260> wheel

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
much easier when you put the rear wheel

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.500 
much easier when you put the rear wheel
back<00:02:33.620> on<00:02:33.799> chain<00:02:34.549> tensioner<00:02:34.970> is<00:02:35.000> right<00:02:35.269> there

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
back on chain tensioner is right there

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.240 
back on chain tensioner is right there
you'll<00:02:36.200> see<00:02:36.349> that's<00:02:36.530> how<00:02:36.650> it<00:02:36.739> keeps<00:02:36.859> tension

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you'll see that's how it keeps tension

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:38.440 
you'll see that's how it keeps tension
on<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.400> chain<00:02:37.430> you<00:02:37.879> want<00:02:37.970> it<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.269> look<00:02:38.420> like

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:38.450 
on the chain you want it to look like

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.479 
on the chain you want it to look like
this<00:02:38.810> then<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.590> want<00:02:39.739> to<00:02:39.799> slip<00:02:39.950> it<00:02:40.099> around<00:02:40.280> the

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
this then you want to slip it around the

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:47.110 
this then you want to slip it around the
sprocket<00:02:41.379> like<00:02:42.379> that<00:02:42.909> okay<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.319> just<00:02:46.120> slip
