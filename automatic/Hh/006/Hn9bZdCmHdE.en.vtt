things<00:01:37.140> inside<00:01:37.500> to<00:01:37.799> make<00:01:37.950> it<00:01:37.979> look<00:01:38.280> much<00:01:39.119> more

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
things inside to make it look much more

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.350 
things inside to make it look much more
of<00:01:39.630> a

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
of a

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.940 
of a
you<00:01:41.900> know<00:01:42.050> like<00:01:42.380> it<00:01:42.530> belongs<00:01:42.860> there<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:44.950> have

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
you know like it belongs there I have

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.710 
you know like it belongs there I have
used<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.370> flat<00:01:46.580> grass<00:01:46.820> mat<00:01:47.030> just<00:01:47.240> because

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
used the flat grass mat just because

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:49.750 
used the flat grass mat just because
this<00:01:47.960> would<00:01:48.830> be<00:01:48.920> the<00:01:49.040> best<00:01:49.220> to<00:01:49.370> show<00:01:49.550> it<00:01:49.670> off

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:49.760 
this would be the best to show it off

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.410 
this would be the best to show it off
because<00:01:49.970> they<00:01:50.420> only<00:01:50.690> build<00:01:51.080> on<00:01:51.260> flat<00:01:51.500> surfaces

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:52.420 
because they only build on flat surfaces

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.700 
because they only build on flat surfaces
but<00:01:53.420> of<00:01:53.570> course<00:01:53.810> there'll<00:01:54.200> be<00:01:54.230> a<00:01:54.350> lot<00:01:54.560> less

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
but of course there'll be a lot less

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:56.770 
but of course there'll be a lot less
buildings<00:01:55.190> than<00:01:55.340> this<00:01:55.520> in<00:01:55.760> the<00:01:55.940> single<00:01:56.660> player

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
buildings than this in the single player

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.640 
buildings than this in the single player
on<00:01:57.170> a<00:01:57.200> normal<00:01:57.500> map<00:01:58.960> so<00:01:59.960> as<00:02:00.110> you<00:02:00.200> can<00:02:00.350> see<00:02:00.530> it's

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
on a normal map so as you can see it's

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.740 
on a normal map so as you can see it's
going<00:02:00.740> night<00:02:01.010> now<00:02:01.220> and<00:02:01.430> zombies<00:02:02.390> and<00:02:02.510> all<00:02:02.600> that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
going night now and zombies and all that

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.880 
going night now and zombies and all that
about<00:02:02.960> to<00:02:03.170> invade<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.680> flat<00:02:03.920> grass<00:02:04.160> mat<00:02:04.430> and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
about to invade the flat grass mat and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.219 
about to invade the flat grass mat and
if<00:02:07.030> because<00:02:08.030> all<00:02:08.149> my<00:02:08.390> god<00:02:08.570> this<00:02:08.690> about<00:02:08.899> it<00:02:09.050> and

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
if because all my god this about it and

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.920 
if because all my god this about it and
because<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.330> single<00:02:11.330> player<00:02:11.450> commands

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
because the single player commands

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.540 
because the single player commands
aren't<00:02:12.110> working<00:02:12.440> at<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.560> moment<00:02:12.800> with<00:02:13.310> the
