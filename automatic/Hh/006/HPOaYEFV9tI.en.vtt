all the levels you'll start off with

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.420 
all the levels you'll start off with
this<00:02:59.930> car<00:03:00.260> that<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.590> have<00:03:00.770> to<00:03:00.920> you<00:03:01.100> know<00:03:01.220> buy

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:01.430

little chickens a little basket being
but<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.470> reason<00:03:06.590> why<00:03:06.800> i<00:03:06.830> like<00:03:06.980> this<00:03:07.130> vehicle

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
but the reason why i like this vehicle

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.000 
but the reason why i like this vehicle
is<00:03:07.880> because<00:03:08.330> they<00:03:08.780> get<00:03:08.959> stuck<00:03:09.260> in<00:03:09.440> between<00:03:09.590> our

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:10.010 
is because they get stuck in between our

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.000 
is because they get stuck in between our
spot<00:03:10.400> dime<00:03:11.090> in<00:03:11.330> those<00:03:12.290> first<00:03:12.680> because<00:03:12.980> it

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
spot dime in those first because it

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:18.759 
spot dime in those first because it
pushes<00:03:13.340> them<00:03:13.580> forward<00:03:16.840> oh<00:03:17.840> no<00:03:18.170> keep<00:03:18.500> it<00:03:18.620> in
