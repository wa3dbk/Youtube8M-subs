is something hard to hold on to it you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.550 
is something hard to hold on to it you
got<00:02:18.790> to<00:02:18.879> have<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> lanyard<00:02:19.299> on<00:02:19.599> it<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.870> threw<00:02:20.409> this

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
got to have a lanyard on it I threw this

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.199 
got to have a lanyard on it I threw this
lanyard<00:02:20.829> because<00:02:21.159> a<00:02:21.189> little<00:02:21.549> bit<00:02:21.640> darker<00:02:22.030> the

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209

original one
gave<00:02:23.530> off<00:02:23.739> too<00:02:23.980> much<00:02:24.189> light<00:02:24.939> reflective<00:02:25.540> light

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
gave off too much light reflective light

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.319 
gave off too much light reflective light
so<00:02:25.989> it's<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:26.560> know<00:02:26.709> not<00:02:26.920> that<00:02:26.950> tactical<00:02:27.700> but

so it's you know not that tactical but

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:31.289 
so it's you know not that tactical but
overall<00:02:28.659> this<00:02:29.440> camera<00:02:29.920> would<00:02:30.190> be<00:02:30.250> pretty<00:02:31.120> good

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299
