pattern<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:01.930> most<00:04:02.440> of<00:04:02.590> the<00:04:02.680> song<00:04:02.920> so<00:04:03.340> and

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:03.820 
pattern for the most of the song so and

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.040 
pattern for the most of the song so and
then<00:04:04.330> after<00:04:04.450> that<00:04:04.750> it's<00:04:06.150> Sun<00:04:07.150> comes<00:04:08.110> up<00:04:08.980> we

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050
