00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
compromise its protection ability it's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.750 
compromise its protection ability it's
quite<00:00:55.050> sturdy<00:00:55.320> otherwise<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:56.039> yes<00:00:56.250> don't

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
quite sturdy otherwise but yes don't

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.069 
quite sturdy otherwise but yes don't
rely<00:00:56.910> on<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.210> camera<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.690> front-facing

rely on the camera the front-facing

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.779 
rely on the camera the front-facing
working<00:00:58.620> and<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> back<00:00:59.129> one<00:00:59.340> doesn't<00:00:59.640> have<00:00:59.730> a

working and the back one doesn't have a
hole<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.120> all<00:01:00.329> so<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.600> can't<00:01:00.840> use<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.020> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
hole at all so you can't use that the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.500 
hole at all so you can't use that the
screen<00:01:02.190> can<00:01:02.460> get<00:01:02.640> damaged<00:01:02.969> actually<00:01:03.270> by<00:01:03.449> the

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
screen can get damaged actually by the

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.450 
screen can get damaged actually by the
keyboard<00:01:03.899> because<00:01:04.019> it<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.379> soft<00:01:04.769> keyboard

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
keyboard because it is a soft keyboard

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.980 
keyboard because it is a soft keyboard
and<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.299> sufficient<00:01:06.570> add<00:01:06.780> protection

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
and it's got sufficient add protection

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.480 
and it's got sufficient add protection
when<00:01:07.409> closed<00:01:07.680> because<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:08.010> has<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.159> magnetic

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
when closed because it has a magnetic

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.340 
when closed because it has a magnetic

much<00:01:55.500> more<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.399> laptop<00:01:56.909> or<00:01:57.000> a<00:01:57.060> netbook

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
much more like a laptop or a netbook

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.080 
much more like a laptop or a netbook
rather<00:01:57.930> than<00:01:58.079> just<00:01:58.290> a<00:01:58.409> touch<00:01:58.619> screen<00:01:58.890> ipad<00:01:59.880> and

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
rather than just a touch screen ipad and

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.020 
rather than just a touch screen ipad and
it's<00:02:00.210> these<00:02:00.360> controls<00:02:00.810> which<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.170> think<00:02:01.500> really

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
it's these controls which I think really

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.310 
it's these controls which I think really
set<00:02:03.030> out<00:02:03.060> from<00:02:03.450> just<00:02:03.750> having<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.990> standard

set out from just having a standard
keyboard<00:02:04.469> on<00:02:04.710> it<00:02:04.799> because<00:02:05.070> you<00:02:05.610> can<00:02:05.790> use<00:02:06.030> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
keyboard on it because you can use it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.240 
keyboard on it because you can use it
like<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.689> map<00:02:06.899> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.259> play<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.500> music<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.069> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250
