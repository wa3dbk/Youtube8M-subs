00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
on the TRX toothpick for 450 this is

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:16.710 
on the TRX toothpick for 450 this is
actually<00:00:15.580> Chris's<00:00:16.029> four-wheel<00:00:16.390> it's<00:00:16.539> not

00:00:21.179 --> 00:00:21.189 
for another item that he had the only

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.159 
for another item that he had the only
issues<00:00:21.490> that<00:00:21.669> we've<00:00:21.820> encountered<00:00:22.180> so<00:00:22.660> far<00:00:22.689> or

is actually just something that we
noticed<00:00:24.490> looks<00:00:25.360> like<00:00:25.570> this<00:00:25.900> machine<00:00:26.380> has<00:00:26.529> been

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.680 
noticed looks like this machine has been

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.040 
noticed looks like this machine has been
wheelie<00:00:26.980> quite<00:00:27.340> a<00:00:27.369> bit<00:00:27.669> as<00:00:27.880> you<00:00:28.000> can<00:00:28.150> tell<00:00:28.330> but

extremely high compression and they're

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.330 
extremely high compression and they're
very<00:01:09.789> high<00:01:10.060> revving<00:01:10.530> if<00:01:11.530> you<00:01:11.710> were<00:01:11.950> to

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
very high revving if you were to

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.790 
very high revving if you were to
actually<00:01:12.399> purchase<00:01:12.820> a<00:01:13.149> 450<00:01:13.690> also<00:01:14.440> keep<00:01:14.679> in

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
actually purchase a 450 also keep in

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:16.020 
actually purchase a 450 also keep in
mind<00:01:15.009> that<00:01:15.130> the<00:01:15.250> oil<00:01:15.399> changes<00:01:15.850> are

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.030 
mind that the oil changes are

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.380 
mind that the oil changes are
considerably<00:01:16.770> sooner<00:01:17.770> than<00:01:18.130> any<00:01:18.549> noble<00:01:18.820> ATV

it<00:02:17.459> this<00:02:18.000> is<00:02:18.060> where<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.510> water<00:02:18.660> will<00:02:18.870> actually

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
it this is where the water will actually

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.339 
it this is where the water will actually
drain<00:02:19.500> from<00:02:19.849> also<00:02:20.849> you<00:02:21.090> will<00:02:21.209> find<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.720> plastic

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:22.349 
drain from also you will find a plastic

skid plate on the trail is probably one
do<00:02:24.840> very<00:02:25.110> good<00:02:25.220> but<00:02:26.220> for<00:02:26.370> racing<00:02:26.730> you'll

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
do very good but for racing you'll

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.350 
do very good but for racing you'll
probably<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.420> fine<00:02:27.630> on<00:02:28.700> this<00:02:29.700> machine<00:02:29.910> here

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
probably just fine on this machine here

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.270 
probably just fine on this machine here

this<00:03:22.680> machine<00:03:23.070> being<00:03:23.430> that<00:03:23.580> it's<00:03:23.730> at<00:03:23.820> 450<00:03:24.360> is

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
this machine being that it's at 450 is

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.510 
this machine being that it's at 450 is
very<00:03:25.260> fast<00:03:25.560> considering<00:03:25.950> what<00:03:26.130> I'm<00:03:26.220> used<00:03:26.460> to

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
very fast considering what I'm used to

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.480 
very fast considering what I'm used to
riding<00:03:26.700> which<00:03:26.910> is<00:03:27.030> either<00:03:27.180> 250<00:03:27.810> or<00:03:27.900> 350

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:28.490 
riding which is either 250 or 350

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.400 
riding which is either 250 or 350
however<00:03:29.490> from<00:03:29.700> what<00:03:29.820> I'm<00:03:29.940> reading<00:03:30.230> that<00:03:31.230> this

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
however from what I'm reading that this

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:32.780 
however from what I'm reading that this
is<00:03:31.590> actually<00:03:31.950> the<00:03:32.100> slowest<00:03:32.550> out<00:03:32.670> of<00:03:32.730> the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
is actually the slowest out of the

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.920 
is actually the slowest out of the
Kawasaki<00:03:33.300> and<00:03:33.480> Yamaha<00:03:33.680> 450s<00:03:35.210> but<00:03:36.210> I<00:03:36.450> guess<00:03:36.810> I

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
Kawasaki and Yamaha 450s but I guess I

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.180 
Kawasaki and Yamaha 450s but I guess I
compared<00:03:37.320> to<00:03:37.350> what<00:03:37.500> I<00:03:37.530> yield<00:03:37.770> on<00:03:37.950> why<00:03:38.130> this

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
compared to what I yield on why this

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.220 
compared to what I yield on why this
thing<00:03:38.340> is<00:03:38.490> fast<00:03:38.790> off<00:03:39.360> in<00:03:39.510> the<00:03:39.570> first<00:03:39.810> gear<00:03:40.050> you

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
thing is fast off in the first gear you

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.930 
thing is fast off in the first gear you
really<00:03:40.560> got<00:03:40.710> to<00:03:40.740> give<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.070> some<00:03:41.100> good<00:03:41.730> hard

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
really got to give it some good hard

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.450 
really got to give it some good hard
gastrin<00:03:42.510> also<00:03:42.720> will<00:03:42.900> stall<00:03:43.200> out<00:03:43.230> the<00:03:44.220> gearing

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:44.460 
gastrin also will stall out the gearing

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.110 
gastrin also will stall out the gearing
is<00:03:44.670> real<00:03:45.060> high<00:03:45.800> also<00:03:46.800> this<00:03:47.550> particular

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
is real high also this particular

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.750 
is real high also this particular
