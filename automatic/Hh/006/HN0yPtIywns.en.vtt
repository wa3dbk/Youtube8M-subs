00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
to look for the yellow white and red
cords<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.390> on<00:01:30.390> this<00:01:30.540> one<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:31.079> specifically

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
cords and on this one it specifically

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.270 
cords and on this one it specifically
says<00:01:31.829> video<00:01:33.110> so<00:01:34.110> just<00:01:34.140> like<00:01:34.530> on<00:01:34.650> our<00:01:34.740> NES<00:01:35.040> we

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
says video so just like on our NES we

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.440 
says video so just like on our NES we
want<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> hook<00:01:35.579> up<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:35.970> red<00:01:36.210> to<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.509> red<00:01:36.810> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
want to hook up the red to the red and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.840 
want to hook up the red to the red and
then<00:01:39.450> our<00:01:39.659> white<00:01:39.900> cord<00:01:40.290> just<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> on<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> NES

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
then our white cord just like on the NES

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.219 
then our white cord just like on the NES
is<00:01:42.060> going<00:01:42.210> to<00:01:42.270> match<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> yellow<00:01:43.049> port

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
is going to match up to the yellow port

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.289 
is going to match up to the yellow port
so<00:01:46.229> we've<00:01:46.350> got<00:01:46.500> our<00:01:46.649> NES<00:01:46.979> hooked<00:01:47.220> up<00:01:47.399> now<00:01:47.579> with

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
so we've got our NES hooked up now with

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.620 
so we've got our NES hooked up now with
our<00:01:48.450> video<00:01:48.720> wires<00:01:48.960> to<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.320> TV<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.490> we<00:01:51.329> want<00:01:51.509> to

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
switch our source on our TV on this

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.030 
switch our source on our TV on this
specific<00:01:57.060> TV<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> be<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.350> AV

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
specific TV it's going to be the AV

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.859

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
find the video or the inputs source then

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.699 
find the video or the inputs source then
we<00:02:08.670> want<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.000> turn<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.360> our<00:02:09.539> NES

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.179 
that so we've got our RF adapter here
and<00:02:26.989> we're<00:02:27.170> going<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.349> plug<00:02:27.590> it<00:02:27.709> in<00:02:27.799> to<00:02:28.069> the

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:28.189 
and we're going to plug it in to the

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.390 
and we're going to plug it in to the
back<00:02:28.370> corner<00:02:28.959> right<00:02:29.959> next<00:02:30.200> to<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.409> power<00:02:30.620> on

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
back corner right next to the power on

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.699 
back corner right next to the power on
the<00:02:32.180> NES<00:02:33.549> this<00:02:34.549> white<00:02:35.359> spot<00:02:35.629> right<00:02:35.840> here<00:02:36.079> your

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
the NES this white spot right here your

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:40.270 
the NES this white spot right here your
RF<00:02:37.129> switch<00:02:38.260> and<00:02:39.260> make<00:02:39.470> sure<00:02:39.620> the<00:02:39.950> channel

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
RF switch and make sure the channel

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.929 
RF switch and make sure the channel
switch<00:02:40.489> next<00:02:40.879> to<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.120> is<00:02:41.269> on<00:02:41.840> channel<00:02:42.230> three

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:42.939 
switch next to it is on channel three

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:47.800 
switch next to it is on channel three
that's<00:02:43.939> towards<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.780> power<00:02:45.670> adapter<00:02:46.810> alright

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
that's towards the power adapter alright

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.259 
that's towards the power adapter alright
so<00:02:48.230> we're<00:02:48.409> going<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.560> plug<00:02:48.799> this<00:02:49.010> in<00:02:49.280> to<00:02:50.090> that

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
so we're going to plug this in to that

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.569 
so we're going to plug this in to that
white<00:02:50.540> port<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.260> then<00:02:51.950> we're<00:02:52.159> going<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.310> go<00:02:52.519> to

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
white port and then we're going to go to

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.000 
white port and then we're going to go to
our<00:02:52.730> TV<00:02:53.209> and<00:02:54.489> find<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.700> coaxial<00:02:56.359> port<00:02:56.859> if<00:02:57.859> it

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
our TV and find the coaxial port if it

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.890 
our TV and find the coaxial port if it
almost<00:02:58.250> looks<00:02:58.549> like<00:02:58.609> a<00:02:58.760> bolts<00:02:59.389> coming<00:02:59.629> out<00:02:59.810> of

00:02:59.890 --> 00:02:59.900 
almost looks like a bolts coming out of

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.610 
almost looks like a bolts coming out of
the<00:02:59.959> TV<00:03:00.200> you<00:03:01.870> want<00:03:02.870> to<00:03:02.930> make<00:03:03.019> sure<00:03:03.049> you<00:03:03.319> line<00:03:03.590> up

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
the TV you want to make sure you line up

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.240 
the TV you want to make sure you line up
the<00:03:04.720> pin<00:03:05.720> and<00:03:06.049> that<00:03:06.349> plug<00:03:06.650> with<00:03:06.889> the<00:03:06.919> hole<00:03:07.220> in

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:07.250 
the pin and that plug with the hole in

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.179 
the pin and that plug with the hole in
the<00:03:07.459> center<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.840> just<00:03:09.849> screw<00:03:10.849> it<00:03:10.970> in<00:03:11.090> there

00:03:12.179 --> 00:03:12.189 
the center and just screw it in there

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.369 
the center and just screw it in there
okay<00:03:13.189> so<00:03:13.250> now<00:03:13.609> we<00:03:13.700> need<00:03:13.819> to<00:03:14.000> change<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:15.019> source

00:03:15.369 --> 00:03:15.379 
okay so now we need to change the source

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:22.210 
okay so now we need to change the source
and<00:03:16.449> on<00:03:17.449> most<00:03:17.780> TVs<00:03:20.079> the<00:03:21.079> import<00:03:21.470> source<00:03:21.709> for

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and on most TVs the import source for

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.719 
and on most TVs the import source for
the<00:03:22.400> RF<00:03:22.940> switch<00:03:23.329> is<00:03:23.599> going<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.900> be<00:03:24.019> TV<00:03:24.729> and

00:03:25.719 --> 00:03:25.729 
the RF switch is going to be TV and

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:29.770 
the RF switch is going to be TV and
