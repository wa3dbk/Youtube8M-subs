00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
 the family of wolves 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:13.580
 a person claims to have seen a 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:15.500
 wolf and at least that's what the newspaper says 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:19.350
 once they saw a wolf 

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.750
 a long time ago secret no longer exists 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.300
 loved recently in the animal magazine 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.730
 experts think it can be treated 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.190
 of a coyote as these have increased 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.280
 of number lately but do not believe in 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.800
 absolute that it's about wolves for 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.489
 course there can not be wolves here 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:42.250
 good but maybe the person who 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:53.670
 find a ceremonious 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:57.160
 I'll find you can make fun of you again 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:00.430
 you do not have to find and hunt a balloon 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.350
 nobita tomorrow sunday we will go to the peak 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.650
 flame wall danica 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:08.580
 doraemon far from my account you have something 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.580
 to find wolves 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.630
 and not seen is very arrogant but that 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.840
 do no wolf will swallow what 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.840
 said census will not be necessary 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.330
 everything much that nothing can happen any 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.330
 Wolf 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:41.630
 that's where the peak was called and so 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630
 let's go down 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:48.010
 sure that around here there has to be 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:50.430
 wolves to this mountain very rarely comes 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.430
 people 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.770
 perhaps you have seen some wolf hovering 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:03.430
 around here if you are a hunter you have not 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:06.300
 seen none of us just arrived and we 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.160
 They said I was for this ugly 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.620
 when I crawl seen out there it seems 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.160
 that everyone has come here to hunt 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.160
 to the wolf 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:29.420
 I would like to know if it really exists 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.519
 sure that wolf but in the 21st century 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.400
 there are wolf packs I assure you 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.140
 so now somewhere too 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.260
 there has to be 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.090
 and we have already gone far enough yes that 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.230
 it's time to take what will make us 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:48.720
 triumph a carvalho apparatus a 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.700
 Moonlight lantern children's 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.569
 world of the future use it to play 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.569
 the werewolf 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.840
 dt all fruit you have given me with that route 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.840
 from strange 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.769
 for color 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.290
 and a logo of another is approaching 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:17.400
 but you must take off your clothes by removing the 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.710
 good clothes if a wolf approaches you 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.840
 shoot him with this and the wolf will remain 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:25.860
 slept a good while 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.340
 It is not sure it will work clear 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.340
 yes 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.990
 ah 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.900
 with the asleep I'm stuck in a good 

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:41.819
 mess raising that the now and we're going 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.819
 out there, get up 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.920
 and 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.650
 but what do you say if you are also a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:55.330
 wolf if you're right a long time ago 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.330
 that I do not meet a wolf 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:06.200
 who looks at me a long time ago our 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.290
 ancestors lived in those mountains in 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.750
 that peak and in that one day they arrived 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.060
 human beings took away our 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:18.500
 you hide our food and I do not know 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.020
 exterminated and only this remains but 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:23.660
 that's what my wife left my children and me 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:27.310
 I must protect my family at all costs 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.310
 although it costs me my life 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.490
 to a welcome guest so my children 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.440
 do not leave home the forest is full 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.270
 of people 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.310
 you think we'll find some of 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:45.750
 true there are wolves here I am 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:49.670
 convinced footprints maybe it was a dog not 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:49.670
 sure he was a wolf out there 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:01.530
 and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:04.370
 from the wind brings the smell of being human 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.370
 really if they come to you is 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:12.470
 unmistakable a large group approaches 

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:12.470
 Mom is falling on her face 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:23.160
 and almost everything you are a human being 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:23.160
 in the morning 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:29.020
 and nothing 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:34.560
 and 

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:37.980
 full I've taken time has followed 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:40.170
 your footprints like you no longer want 

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.530
 hunt them after having risked the 

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:45.240
 life because this family of wolves lives 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:47.700
 quiet in the interior of the mountain 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:48.540
 after being persecuted by the 

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:51.020
 mens 

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:54.980
 Doraemon, please leave them alone 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.980
 it's fine it's fine 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.870
 we have registered the entire area but not 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:03.590
 we have found no trace of what 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:06.160
 you really gave him you will have to swallow 

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.160
 your words 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.110
 that does not exist 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.960
 do not
