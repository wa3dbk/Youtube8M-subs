thing<00:00:56.310> we're<00:00:56.430> going<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.760> is<00:00:56.940> go<00:00:57.060> ahead<00:00:57.210> and

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
thing we're going to do is go ahead and

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.850 
thing we're going to do is go ahead and
turn<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.540> car<00:00:57.750> on<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.260> what<00:00:58.380> we<00:00:58.500> should<00:00:58.710> get

00:00:58.850 --> 00:00:58.860 
turn the car on and what we should get

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.740 
turn the car on and what we should get
is<00:00:58.920> a<00:00:59.100> blinking<00:00:59.700> green<00:00:59.940> light<00:01:00.060> on<00:01:00.450> the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
is a blinking green light on the

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.650 
is a blinking green light on the
receiver<00:01:01.520> so<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:02.670> that<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.910> car<00:01:03.090> is<00:01:03.180> on<00:01:03.330> we're

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
receiver so now that the car is on we're

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.889 
receiver so now that the car is on we're
going<00:01:03.780> to<00:01:03.840> go<00:01:03.930> ahead<00:01:04.049> grab<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.890> transmitter

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
going to go ahead grab the transmitter

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:08.330 
going to go ahead grab the transmitter
we're<00:01:06.899> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.079> hold<00:01:07.320> down<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:08.009> bind

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
we're going to hold down this bind

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.520 
we're going to hold down this bind
button<00:01:08.700> on<00:01:08.969> the<00:01:09.359> transmitter<00:01:09.810> while<00:01:10.229> turning

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
button on the transmitter while turning

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.529 
button on the transmitter while turning
this<00:01:10.770> on<00:01:10.950> so<00:01:11.820> we're<00:01:11.909> going<00:01:11.999> to<00:01:12.060> turn<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.390> on

00:01:12.529 --> 00:01:12.539

and<00:01:36.929> show<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.109> how<00:01:37.289> to<00:01:37.319> do<00:01:37.499> with<00:01:37.679> the<00:01:37.770> s<00:01:37.889> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
and show you how to do with the s and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.120 
and show you how to do with the s and
the<00:01:38.219> R<00:01:38.399> series<00:01:39.170> pretty<00:01:40.170> much<00:01:40.350> a<00:01:40.590> spectrum<00:01:41.009> with

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
the R series pretty much a spectrum with

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.539 
the R series pretty much a spectrum with
the<00:01:41.219> screen<00:01:42.170> alright<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.770> first<00:01:43.979> steps<00:01:44.280> going

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the screen alright so first steps going

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.160 
the screen alright so first steps going
to<00:01:44.639> go<00:01:44.759> ahead<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.149> insert<00:01:45.630> your<00:01:45.689> bind<00:01:45.959> plug

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
to go ahead and insert your bind plug

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.370 
to go ahead and insert your bind plug
just<00:01:46.350> like<00:01:46.619> we<00:01:46.770> did<00:01:46.889> before<00:01:48.049> turn<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.170> car<00:01:49.350> on
