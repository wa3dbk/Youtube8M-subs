we're going to do in this lesson is take

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.360 
we're going to do in this lesson is take
different<00:00:45.750> beats<00:00:46.110> from<00:00:46.320> different<00:00:46.740> lines<00:00:47.010> of

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
different beats from different lines of

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.180 
different beats from different lines of
the<00:00:48.240> master<00:00:48.600> list<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.990> combine<00:00:49.560> them<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.950> form

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the master list and combine them to form

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.640 
the master list and combine them to form
musical<00:00:50.820> sentences<00:00:51.330> so<00:00:52.170> what<00:00:52.350> I've<00:00:52.470> selected

is<00:00:53.100> just<00:00:53.430> a<00:00:53.930> random<00:00:54.930> sort<00:00:55.560> of<00:00:55.650> series<00:00:56.070> of

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
is just a random sort of series of

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.020 
is just a random sort of series of
exercises<00:00:57.500> there's<00:00:58.500> way<00:00:58.980> more<00:00:59.030> possibilities

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
exercises there's way more possibilities

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.730 
exercises there's way more possibilities
than<00:01:00.060> what<00:01:00.390> I've<00:01:00.510> selected<00:01:00.720> I've<00:01:01.260> just<00:01:01.440> chosen

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:01.740 
than what I've selected I've just chosen

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.479 
than what I've selected I've just chosen
a<00:01:02.010> nice<00:01:02.190> cross<00:01:02.670> section<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.210> exercises<00:01:04.140> and

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
a nice cross section of exercises and

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.620 
a nice cross section of exercises and
I'm<00:01:05.489> going<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.729> play<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.030> through<00:01:06.299> for<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I'm going to play them through for you

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.319 
I'm going to play them through for you
now<00:01:06.780> nice<00:01:07.020> and<00:01:07.049> slow<00:01:07.469> four<00:01:08.280> times<00:01:08.549> each<00:01:08.789> so<00:01:09.240> you

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:09.329 
now nice and slow four times each so you

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:11.120 
now nice and slow four times each so you
can<00:01:09.479> really<00:01:09.840> see<00:01:10.020> what's<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.679> from<00:01:11.039> a

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
can really see what's going on from a

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.660 
can really see what's going on from a
few<00:01:11.310> different<00:01:11.399> angles<00:01:13.759> one<00:01:15.140> two<00:01:16.429> one<00:01:17.429> two

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
few different angles one two one two

00:01:17.670 --> 00:02:58.259 
few different angles one two one two
three<00:01:18.469> four

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.699 

okay<00:02:59.269> so<00:02:59.329> the<00:02:59.569> idea<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.989> you'd<00:03:00.139> practice<00:03:00.500> each

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
okay so the idea is you'd practice each

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.520 
okay so the idea is you'd practice each
line<00:03:01.010> nice<00:03:01.370> and<00:03:01.639> slow<00:03:01.900> more<00:03:02.900> than<00:03:03.079> four<00:03:03.290> times

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
line nice and slow more than four times

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.580 
line nice and slow more than four times
each<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:05.090> don't<00:03:05.629> go<00:03:05.720> above<00:03:05.959> the<00:03:06.139> speed<00:03:06.349> where

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
each and don't go above the speed where

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.349 
each and don't go above the speed where
you're<00:03:06.709> feeling<00:03:07.069> really<00:03:07.400> really<00:03:08.120> comfortable

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 
you're feeling really really comfortable

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:11.379 
you're feeling really really comfortable
putting<00:03:09.079> these<00:03:09.169> together<00:03:09.409> and<00:03:09.829> if<00:03:10.700> they<00:03:11.090> feel

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:11.389 
putting these together and if they feel

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.750 
putting these together and if they feel
really<00:03:11.840> alien<00:03:12.290> and<00:03:12.470> really<00:03:13.280> really<00:03:13.549> difficult

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
really alien and really really difficult

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.809 
really alien and really really difficult
go<00:03:14.629> back<00:03:14.810> and<00:03:14.989> practice<00:03:15.109> the<00:03:15.439> basic<00:03:15.919> master

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:16.819 
go back and practice the basic master

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:19.210 
go back and practice the basic master
list<00:03:17.000> exercises<00:03:17.959> which<00:03:18.109> is<00:03:18.230> just<00:03:18.409> repeating

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
list exercises which is just repeating

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.520 
list exercises which is just repeating
each<00:03:19.370> exercise<00:03:19.849> over<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.659> over<00:03:20.900> and<00:03:20.989> over<00:03:21.109> and

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
each exercise over and over and over and

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:25.210 
each exercise over and over and over and
before<00:03:22.340> we<00:03:22.459> get<00:03:22.579> into<00:03:22.849> combining<00:03:23.569> it<00:03:23.799> and<00:03:24.799> so

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
before we get into combining it and so

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.670 
before we get into combining it and so
what<00:03:25.340> we'll<00:03:25.459> get<00:03:25.579> into<00:03:25.699> in<00:03:25.909> the<00:03:25.970> future<00:03:26.359> is

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
what we'll get into in the future is

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.140 
what we'll get into in the future is
basically<00:03:27.680> doing<00:03:27.889> exactly<00:03:28.370> the<00:03:28.549> same<00:03:28.790> thing

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
basically doing exactly the same thing

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:32.110 
basically doing exactly the same thing
creating<00:03:30.079> these<00:03:30.199> snare<00:03:30.979> drum<00:03:31.250> phrases<00:03:31.909> and

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
creating these snare drum phrases and

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.050 
creating these snare drum phrases and
placing<00:03:33.109> them<00:03:33.229> onto<00:03:33.379> the<00:03:33.590> bass<00:03:33.799> drum<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:34.340> then

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
placing them onto the bass drum and then

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.449 
placing them onto the bass drum and then
we<00:03:35.389> combine<00:03:35.659> the<00:03:36.229> snare<00:03:36.500> drum<00:03:36.739> and<00:03:36.919> bass<00:03:37.280> drum
