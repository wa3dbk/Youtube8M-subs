and<00:00:59.409> we<00:01:00.409> have<00:01:00.559> a<00:01:00.589> how<00:01:01.159> to<00:01:01.220> start<00:01:01.519> whisper<00:01:01.970> in

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:02.299 
and we have a how to start whisper in

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:04.950 
and we have a how to start whisper in
our<00:01:02.629> dustpan<00:01:03.500> and<00:01:03.530> need<00:01:04.220> a<00:01:04.309> scrub<00:01:04.610> brush

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
our dustpan and need a scrub brush

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.170 
our dustpan and need a scrub brush
basically<00:01:05.960> these<00:01:06.200> stains<00:01:06.920> are<00:01:07.190> dry<00:01:07.490> and<00:01:07.880> so

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
basically these stains are dry and so

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.520 
basically these stains are dry and so
what<00:01:08.420> we<00:01:08.540> need<00:01:08.689> to<00:01:08.719> do<00:01:08.869> is<00:01:08.990> we<00:01:09.109> need<00:01:09.229> to<00:01:09.350> have

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
what we need to do is we need to have

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.770 
what we need to do is we need to have
solvent<00:01:10.159> and<00:01:10.310> any<00:01:10.670> type<00:01:10.909> of<00:01:10.939> solvent<00:01:11.270> will<00:01:11.570> do

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
solvent and any type of solvent will do

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.630 
solvent and any type of solvent will do
that<00:01:12.049> in<00:01:12.680> this<00:01:12.799> case<00:01:13.039> we're<00:01:13.250> going<00:01:13.399> to<00:01:13.460> use

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
that in this case we're going to use

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.630 
that in this case we're going to use
typical<00:01:14.450> paint<00:01:14.689> thinner<00:01:14.930> and<00:01:15.530> so<00:01:16.009> you'll<00:01:16.460> get

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
typical paint thinner and so you'll get

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.179 
typical paint thinner and so you'll get
the<00:01:16.789> idea<00:01:17.200> how<00:01:18.200> this<00:01:18.380> will<00:01:18.619> work<00:01:18.649> so<00:01:19.070> we're

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
the idea how this will work so we're

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:20.770 
the idea how this will work so we're
going<00:01:19.280> to<00:01:19.340> do<00:01:19.430> this<00:01:19.609> particular<00:01:19.850> stain<00:01:20.450> here

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
going to do this particular stain here

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.450 
going to do this particular stain here
which<00:01:20.990> is<00:01:21.170> shown<00:01:21.409> on<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.649> concrete<00:01:22.100> we

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
which is shown on the concrete we

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.859 
which is shown on the concrete we
haven't<00:01:22.700> done<00:01:22.880> it<00:01:23.090> it's<00:01:23.240> been<00:01:23.450> there<00:01:23.570> for<00:01:23.810> a

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
haven't done it it's been there for a

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:25.719 
haven't done it it's been there for a
while<00:01:24.079> and<00:01:24.770> so<00:01:25.009> what<00:01:25.100> we're<00:01:25.189> gonna<00:01:25.280> do<00:01:25.490> is<00:01:25.700> just

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729 
while and so what we're gonna do is just

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.240 
while and so what we're gonna do is just
add<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.719> little<00:01:26.899> bit<00:01:27.049> of<00:01:27.259> typical<00:01:27.829> little<00:01:28.009> paint

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
add a little bit of typical little paint

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.160 
add a little bit of typical little paint
there<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.880> you<00:01:29.210> can<00:01:29.359> see<00:01:29.539> it<00:01:29.630> spreads<00:01:29.990> out

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
there and you can see it spreads out

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.649 
there and you can see it spreads out
kind<00:01:30.740> of<00:01:30.770> like<00:01:30.890> jet<00:01:31.159> fuel<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:32.210> will<00:01:32.329> spring<00:01:32.600> up

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
kind of like jet fuel it will spring up

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:51.530 
kind of like jet fuel it will spring up
quickly<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.890> thinly

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:02:05.280 

first<00:01:52.540> thing<00:02:03.240> we're<00:02:04.240> going<00:02:04.330> to<00:02:04.390> do<00:02:04.540> now<00:02:04.750> is

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:05.290 
first thing we're going to do now is

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.760 
first thing we're going to do now is
we're<00:02:05.470> just<00:02:05.590> gonna<00:02:05.740> spread<00:02:06.070> a<00:02:06.580> light<00:02:07.410> film<00:02:08.410> of

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
we're just gonna spread a light film of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.390 
we're just gonna spread a light film of
greens<00:02:09.130> or<00:02:09.369> across<00:02:10.030> this<00:02:11.100> solution<00:02:12.100> this

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
greens or across this solution this

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.510 
greens or across this solution this
solvent<00:02:12.880> just<00:02:13.120> to<00:02:13.210> pick<00:02:13.420> up<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.750> stain<00:02:16.260> in<00:02:17.260> the

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
solvent just to pick up the stain in the

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
solvent just to pick up the stain in the
in<00:02:18.630> the<00:02:19.630> older<00:02:19.930> oil<00:02:20.260> that<00:02:20.470> was<00:02:20.590> in<00:02:20.650> there

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.540 

well<00:02:25.540> surely<00:02:25.810> it<00:02:26.130> live

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.950 

probably<00:02:30.550> using<00:02:30.790> way<00:02:30.940> more<00:02:31.150> greens<00:02:31.450> or<00:02:31.690> do<00:02:31.840> we

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960
