finally work down to it I think it's
going<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.590> be<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.680> great<00:00:49.920> new<00:00:50.280> addition<00:00:50.700> doesn't

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
going to be a great new addition doesn't

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.939

ever been a real big fan of elif let's
see<00:01:06.060> how<00:01:06.180> this<00:01:06.330> taint<00:01:06.630> performs<00:01:07.409> actually<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
see how this taint performs actually on

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.320 
see how this taint performs actually on
the<00:01:08.490> map<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:10.220> tend<00:01:11.220> to<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> these<00:01:11.610> things<00:01:11.670> post

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330

commentary<00:01:12.840> after<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.830> match<00:01:14.070> is<00:01:14.610> complete<00:01:15.000> I

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
commentary after the match is complete I

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.929 
commentary after the match is complete I
usually<00:01:15.540> just<00:01:15.770> fire<00:01:16.770> up<00:01:16.799> traps<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.670> record

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
usually just fire up traps and record

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.690 
usually just fire up traps and record
everything<00:01:18.080> it's<00:01:19.080> just<00:01:19.229> easier<00:01:19.560> that<00:01:19.619> way<00:01:19.770> if

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
everything it's just easier that way if

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.460 
everything it's just easier that way if
I<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.150> when<00:01:21.360> I'm<00:01:21.390> actually<00:01:21.659> playing<00:01:22.170> it

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
I do it when I'm actually playing it

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.590 
I do it when I'm actually playing it
seems<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.280> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> slow<00:01:24.000> down<00:01:24.180> my<00:01:24.330> friends

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
seems to kind of slow down my friends

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.160 
seems to kind of slow down my friends
per<00:01:24.780> second<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.409> only<00:01:25.860> get<00:01:26.040> around<00:01:26.220> 30

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
per second I only get around 30

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.469 
per second I only get around 30
now<00:01:28.830> I<00:01:28.860> can't<00:01:29.280> play<00:01:29.400> your<00:01:29.580> best<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:30.270> 30

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
now I can't play your best with 30

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
now I can't play your best with 30
frames<00:01:30.720> per<00:01:30.840> second<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.409> ideally<00:01:32.250> want<00:01:32.280> at

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
frames per second you ideally want at

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.780 
frames per second you ideally want at
least<00:01:32.759> 50<00:01:33.590> so<00:01:34.590> that's<00:01:34.890> why<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.070> usually<00:01:35.490> just<00:01:35.520> do

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
least 50 so that's why I usually just do

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.249 
least 50 so that's why I usually just do
a<00:01:35.820> post<00:01:36.060> commentary<00:01:36.450> on<00:01:36.570> this<00:01:36.720> well<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.229> first

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a post commentary on this well the first

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.870 
a post commentary on this well the first
things<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.830> noticed<00:01:37.860> about<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.460> tank<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
things I noticed about this tank to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.850 
things I noticed about this tank to
shore<00:01:39.090> was<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.450> has<00:01:39.570> create<00:01:40.200> gun<00:01:40.560> depression

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
shore was it has create gun depression

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.779 
shore was it has create gun depression
and<00:01:41.479> I've<00:01:42.479> never<00:01:42.659> really<00:01:43.020> noticed<00:01:43.460> well<00:01:44.460> used

00:01:44.779 --> 00:01:44.789 
and I've never really noticed well used

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.050 
and I've never really noticed well used
that<00:01:45.000> on<00:01:45.149> German<00:01:45.479> tanks<00:01:45.810> but<00:01:46.080> I<00:01:46.320> suppose<00:01:47.280> the

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
that on German tanks but I suppose the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.300 
that on German tanks but I suppose the
dicker<00:01:48.270> max<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.899> tier<00:01:49.080> 6<00:01:49.380> premium<00:01:49.830> tank<00:01:50.100> has

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
dicker max the tier 6 premium tank has

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.029 
dicker max the tier 6 premium tank has
that<00:01:50.549> so<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.390> don't<00:01:51.780> act<00:01:51.990> on<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.439> dicker<00:01:52.590> max<00:01:52.680> I

it's<00:03:49.060> packs<00:03:49.360> a<00:03:49.480> powerful<00:03:49.630> punch<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.290> that's

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
it's packs a powerful punch and that's

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.620 
it's packs a powerful punch and that's
what<00:03:50.530> I<00:03:50.560> liked<00:03:50.800> about<00:03:50.890> it<00:03:54.300> it's<00:03:55.300> got<00:03:55.450> great

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
what I liked about it it's got great

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.930 
what I liked about it it's got great
accuracy<00:03:55.960> to<00:03:56.380> you<00:03:56.770> know<00:03:57.010> watch<00:03:57.220> the<00:03:57.280> aim<00:03:57.670> times

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
accuracy to you know watch the aim times

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:00.780 
accuracy to you know watch the aim times
if<00:03:58.600> you<00:03:58.870> sometimes<00:03:59.830> you<00:03:59.950> can<00:04:00.130> take<00:04:00.250> snapshots

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
if you sometimes you can take snapshots

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.880 
if you sometimes you can take snapshots
with<00:04:00.970> it<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.390> take<00:04:01.990> snapshots<00:04:02.440> but<00:04:02.710> just

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
with it I take snapshots but just

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:05.310 
with it I take snapshots but just
because<00:04:03.010> of<00:04:03.220> the<00:04:03.390> 0.3<00:04:04.390> for<00:04:04.570> accuracy<00:04:05.050> I

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:05.320 
because of the 0.3 for accuracy I

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.850 
because of the 0.3 for accuracy I
believe<00:04:06.100> it's<00:04:06.340> it's<00:04:07.270> possible<00:04:07.690> to<00:04:07.840> it<00:04:07.900> you

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
believe it's it's possible to it you

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.080 
believe it's it's possible to it you
don't<00:04:09.040> always<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.310> to<00:04:09.460> wait<00:04:09.670> for<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:09.940> ham

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
don't always have to wait for the ham

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.730 
don't always have to wait for the ham
time<00:04:10.330> and<00:04:10.630> the<00:04:10.810> aim<00:04:10.930> time<00:04:11.140> is<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.380> little<00:04:11.530> high

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:11.740 
time and the aim time is a little high

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:18.920 
time and the aim time is a little high
for<00:04:11.770> this<00:04:12.070> tank<00:04:16.680> just<00:04:17.680> trust<00:04:18.100> in<00:04:18.280> serve<00:04:18.580> and

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
for this tank just trust in serve and

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:33.210 
for this tank just trust in serve and
shut<00:04:19.930> hit<00:04:20.230> dead<00:04:20.470> center<00:04:20.910> every<00:04:21.910> time

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:33.220 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.300 

I<00:04:33.450> think<00:04:34.450> I<00:04:34.510> chose<00:04:35.290> this<00:04:35.350> rock<00:04:35.710> face<00:04:36.010> too

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
I think I chose this rock face too

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.620 
I think I chose this rock face too
because<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:36.730> was<00:04:36.850> a<00:04:36.910> good<00:04:37.030> place<00:04:37.300> to<00:04:37.480> hide

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
because it was a good place to hide

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:41.280 
because it was a good place to hide
against<00:04:37.960> potential<00:04:38.560> RT<00:04:39.660> might<00:04:40.660> have<00:04:40.840> got<00:04:41.050> hit

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:41.290 
against potential RT might have got hit

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.260 
against potential RT might have got hit

at Tennessee 25 trying to climb he did
get<00:04:49.330> me<00:04:49.480> with<00:04:49.630> two<00:04:49.930> good<00:04:50.200> pings<00:04:50.500> but<00:04:50.830> he's

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:51.820 
get me with two good pings but he's

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:53.310 
get me with two good pings but he's
facing<00:04:52.090> off<00:04:52.390> against<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:52.720> tank<00:04:52.990> with<00:04:53.110> heavy

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320

Elka<00:04:53.740> doesn't<00:04:54.640> really<00:04:54.760> want<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.060> go

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
Elka doesn't really want to go

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:56.910 
Elka doesn't really want to go
toe-to-toe<00:04:55.360> with<00:04:55.660> me<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.020> that's<00:04:56.170> what<00:04:56.320> ended

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
toe-to-toe with me and that's what ended

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.010 
toe-to-toe with me and that's what ended
up<00:04:57.070> happening<00:04:57.130> to<00:04:57.640> him<00:04:57.730> just<00:04:57.940> because<00:04:58.150> he

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
up happening to him just because he

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.870 
up happening to him just because he
thought<00:04:59.200> he<00:04:59.350> could<00:04:59.380> kind<00:04:59.950> of<00:05:00.040> trade<00:05:00.640> shots

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
thought he could kind of trade shots

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.730 
thought he could kind of trade shots
with<00:05:01.090> me<00:05:01.240> plus<00:05:01.780> him<00:05:01.990> I<00:05:02.020> would<00:05:02.260> have<00:05:02.350> just<00:05:02.380> ran

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
with me plus him I would have just ran

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:04.860 
with me plus him I would have just ran
like<00:05:03.460> I<00:05:03.580> how<00:05:03.880> I<00:05:03.910> don't<00:05:04.090> trade<00:05:04.300> shots<00:05:04.540> of<00:05:04.720> tile

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
like I how I don't trade shots of tile

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.720 
like I how I don't trade shots of tile
for<00:05:05.170> tanks<00:05:05.410> like<00:05:05.560> that<00:05:06.090> as<00:05:07.090> 21<00:05:07.660> 22<00:05:08.080> and

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
for tanks like that as 21 22 and

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.160 
for tanks like that as 21 22 and
especially<00:05:09.730> not<00:05:10.060> in<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.330> fast<00:05:10.570> firing<00:05:10.840> small

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:11.170 
especially not in a fast firing small

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.410 
especially not in a fast firing small
tank<00:05:11.410> like<00:05:11.560> that<00:05:11.770> really<00:05:12.670> the<00:05:12.880> bigger<00:05:13.060> tanks

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:13.420 
tank like that really the bigger tanks

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.410 
tank like that really the bigger tanks
can<00:05:13.600> just<00:05:13.780> peek<00:05:13.990> out<00:05:14.110> take<00:05:14.440> a<00:05:14.470> shot<00:05:14.740> at<00:05:14.890> you

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
can just peek out take a shot at you

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.790 
can just peek out take a shot at you
peek<00:05:16.420> out<00:05:16.600> again<00:05:16.630> take<00:05:17.050> another<00:05:17.200> shot<00:05:17.440> at<00:05:17.500> you

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
peek out again take another shot at you

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.070 
peek out again take another shot at you
and<00:05:18.120> even<00:05:19.120> if<00:05:19.210> you<00:05:19.300> have<00:05:19.420> fast<00:05:19.630> rate<00:05:19.810> of<00:05:19.900> fire

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
and even if you have fast rate of fire

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:21.270 
and even if you have fast rate of fire
you're<00:05:20.320> not<00:05:20.440> really<00:05:20.680> going<00:05:20.860> to<00:05:20.950> be<00:05:21.040> able<00:05:21.130> to

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:21.280 
you're not really going to be able to

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.820 
you're not really going to be able to
keep<00:05:21.400> up<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.880> high<00:05:22.030> alpha<00:05:22.210> damage<00:05:22.510> and<00:05:22.990> really

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
keep up the high alpha damage and really

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.350 
keep up the high alpha damage and really
showed<00:05:24.040> that<00:05:24.070> guy<00:05:24.400> what<00:05:24.850> happens<00:05:25.180> when<00:05:25.270> you

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:25.360 
showed that guy what happens when you

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.050 
showed that guy what happens when you
try<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:25.630> do<00:05:25.720> that<00:05:28.440> so<00:05:29.440> yeah<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:29.800> far<00:05:30.100> I've<00:05:30.910> only

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
try and do that so yeah so far I've only

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.450 
try and do that so yeah so far I've only
done<00:05:31.540> try<00:05:32.110> this<00:05:32.169> tank<00:05:32.560> a<00:05:32.680> few<00:05:32.860> battles<00:05:33.040> but<00:05:33.280> i

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
done try this tank a few battles but i

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.700 
done try this tank a few battles but i
really<00:05:33.790> like<00:05:33.940> it<00:05:34.120> and<00:05:34.270> i<00:05:34.390> think<00:05:34.750> it's

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:35.710 
really like it and i think it's

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.350 
really like it and i think it's
definitely<00:05:35.980> going<00:05:36.310> to<00:05:36.370> be<00:05:36.460> one<00:05:36.669> of<00:05:36.790> the<00:05:36.910> new

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
definitely going to be one of the new

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:39.900 
definitely going to be one of the new
additions<00:05:37.840> to<00:05:37.900> my<00:05:38.020> garage<00:05:38.350> a<00:05:38.910> permanent

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
additions to my garage a permanent

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.470 
additions to my garage a permanent
addition<00:05:40.919> usually<00:05:41.919> I<00:05:42.310> only<00:05:42.790> keep<00:05:43.060> the<00:05:43.210> tanks

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
addition usually I only keep the tanks

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.480 
addition usually I only keep the tanks
that<00:05:43.570> I<00:05:43.630> really<00:05:43.900> like<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.140> it<00:05:44.680> depends<00:05:45.130> on<00:05:45.310> I

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
that I really like and it depends on I

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:46.590 
that I really like and it depends on I
think<00:05:45.730> it's<00:05:45.820> going<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:46.000> perform<00:05:46.300> even<00:05:46.570> better

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:46.600 
think it's going to perform even better

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.200 
think it's going to perform even better
on<00:05:46.930> the<00:05:47.020> live<00:05:47.200> server<00:05:47.470> so<00:05:48.310> it's<00:05:48.820> one<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.120> those

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:49.210 
on the live server so it's one of those

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.240 
on the live server so it's one of those
tanks<00:05:49.600> that<00:05:49.660> I<00:05:49.750> think<00:05:49.990> I'll<00:05:50.410> be<00:05:50.590> keeping<00:05:50.800> /

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:51.250 
tanks that I think I'll be keeping /
