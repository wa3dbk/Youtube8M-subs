00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:32.620 
wanna go really fast when you fight try
this<00:01:28.850> one<00:01:29.180> frankly<00:01:29.869> really<00:01:30.140> fast<00:01:30.409> on<00:01:31.360> the<00:01:32.360> same

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
this one frankly really fast on the same

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.499 
this one frankly really fast on the same
so<00:01:33.439> you<00:01:33.500> have<00:01:33.740> an<00:01:34.070> angle<00:01:34.549> like<00:01:34.579> this<00:01:34.820> okay

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.440 

then<00:01:38.509> trying<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.869> say<00:01:39.049> we<00:01:39.829> can<00:01:39.979> able<00:01:40.100> like<00:01:40.340> it

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.760 

then<00:01:44.450> I<00:01:44.479> feel<00:01:44.780> the<00:01:44.869> cheaper<00:01:45.140> to<00:01:45.290> know<00:01:46.540> the

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:47.770 
then I feel the cheaper to know the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.359 
then I feel the cheaper to know the
smaller<00:01:49.090> any<00:01:50.090> we<00:01:50.600> have<00:01:50.869> the<00:01:51.229> faster<00:01:51.830> even<00:01:52.280> if

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:52.369 
smaller any we have the faster even if

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:55.600 
smaller any we have the faster even if
you<00:01:52.430> can<00:01:52.579> move<00:01:52.939> it<00:01:53.180> you<00:01:53.299> know<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:54.680> not<00:01:55.220> you

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:55.610 
you can move it you know it's not you

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.820 
you can move it you know it's not you
know<00:01:55.640> what<00:01:55.909> I<00:01:56.180> also<00:01:56.600> like<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.439> know<00:01:57.470> to<00:01:57.590> be
