00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.760
 Hello to all and to all mc 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.779
 carthery people for this first 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.430
 video on my channel so first tutorial 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.390
 tutorial on minecraft how 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.790
 build a fountain 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.110
 so it's true that there are a lot of people 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.250
 who want to know how to build 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:38.900
 a fountain and well it's very simple 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.940
 you will have the answer in this 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:43.129
 video so a fountain is very pretty 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.140
 plus it's going to be very fast with no 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.070
 a lot of material and it's really 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:51.530
 really that it showcases a world 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.399
 fountains here and there 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.820
 so we will immediately begin 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.680
 tutorial so you i 'm going to show you 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.670
 what will our fountain look like 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.880
 fine and well here 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.070
 she will look like that a beautiful 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.200
 fountain with a nice pig next door but 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.290
 it's not going together 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.550
 so the fountain like those of which I 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.670
 will teach you how to do it 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:19.250
 it's very simple very fast and very 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.459
 so pretty well on your shoulders I had to 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.690
 do the same dimensions as me ago 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.600
 bigger there are smaller it's true 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.340
 but do as you wish 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.179
 you may even be able to do with 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.619
 luminous slabs 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:32.390
 well I'm really to blame 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.920
 classics for m was flowers 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.160
 around the lights do what you 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.490
 want me anyway I make the base 

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:43.700
 so let's go then the material 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:46.700
 necessary will be my stepmother the delay 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.229
 migdal of the rock and years back is 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.300
 very simple he could not so that's true 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.149
 that you can do that quite 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.330
 down on life 1 it's really possible 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.429
 there is no need for really much 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.240
 of materials so we'll start everything 

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:07.250
 immediately we will make the base so you 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.560
 go take the slab enemy is in 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.050
 break and 3.3 diagonally and you have 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.720
 not put one to redo three but 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.819
 directly passed here to put 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.210
 three so that will make a two and 3 1 2 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:34.460
 3 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:34.460
 3 here is a 2 3 1 2 3 1 2 3 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:47.340
 I think I missed yes there 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:54.090
 Anything I have I put only 2 2 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:57.230
 m 3 so that's normally what you 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:03.810
 did that in the end so far so good 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:06.240
 then as easy you go you 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.000
 go fill your soil 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:10.190
 finally you will put on the floor that 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.180
 seems logical 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:13.710
 you will do one of the migdal 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.120
 in your fountain finally anyway 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.680
 me that's what I do know 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.960
 joly after you can do as you 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.320
 of course I want to say I'm doing the 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.660
 basic classic version but you 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.650
 can do as you want 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.710
 me in any case me I put some of 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.370
 migdal you do not have to but we get 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.980
 find her prettiest 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.400
 after do as you want I see 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.140
 as the day goes down and on the other side 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.360
 the miss ales it seems logical 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:51.290
 so we will still try to 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:55.099
 hurry excuse me hop hop hop hop 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:58.359
 hop hop hop 

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:00.340
 so maybe we'll take torches 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:04.670
 tock 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.900
 here I rest bah so good there that to 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:11.480
 look pretty I asked myself a 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.159
 here now as media cd 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:19.370
 do not know I was asking myself one in the 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:21.229
 corners like this after you can not 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.180
 necessarily put wrongs can put 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.419
 bright pierrots be I tell you 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.060
 do what you want here then 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:31.310
 then we will locate the middle 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:32.380
 who is right here when it depends 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.039
 dimensions 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:36.889
 make sure it's really 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:42.440
 middle otherwise it may overflow so 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:44.900
 we will put 4 more rush plus one 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.259
 half slab just above then you 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.610
 put on each side of the half 

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:55.820
 slab another of vidal also then 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.990
 I'm sorry sanac not bad long 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.650
 wait in music that's no it's good 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:08.060
 here and now the final touch 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:11.479
 we laid the water and there miracle a 

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:12.139
 fountain that does not overflow but this 

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:14.630
 is not finished 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.070
 can also removed you are not 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:18.169
 not obliged me I remove it 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:20.630
 you can remove everything we had 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:24.770
 put inside it will not change the 

00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.900
 water disposition and that's not okay 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:28.760
 will instead embellish your funds tel 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.400

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:34.220
