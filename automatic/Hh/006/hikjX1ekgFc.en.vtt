00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
going to be streaking this is why we let

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.109 
going to be streaking this is why we let
it<00:01:04.320> dry<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.769> few<00:01:04.830> days<00:01:05.159> if<00:01:05.400> we<00:01:05.549> didn't<00:01:05.909> all

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
it dry for a few days if we didn't all

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.750 
it dry for a few days if we didn't all
that<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:06.869> been<00:01:06.990> lifted<00:01:07.170> up<00:01:07.670> now<00:01:08.670> I'm

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
that would have been lifted up now I'm

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.250 
that would have been lifted up now I'm
not<00:01:08.909> going<00:01:09.030> to<00:01:09.090> take<00:01:09.180> a<00:01:09.210> slurry<00:01:09.659> but<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> am

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
not going to take a slurry but I am

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.780 
not going to take a slurry but I am
going<00:01:10.380> to<00:01:10.470> thin<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.770> oil<00:01:10.920> paint<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.369> bit<00:01:11.580> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
going to thin the oil paint a bit and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.630 
going to thin the oil paint a bit and
using<00:01:12.299> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.540> fine<00:01:12.780> brushes<00:01:13.380> I'm<00:01:14.100> going

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
using one of the fine brushes I'm going

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.270 
using one of the fine brushes I'm going
to<00:01:14.729> start<00:01:14.970> painting<00:01:15.380> some<00:01:16.380> streaks<00:01:16.710> here<00:01:17.100> and

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
to start painting some streaks here and

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.850 
to start painting some streaks here and
notice<00:01:18.180> I'm<00:01:18.299> going<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.869> because<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.650> is<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
notice I'm going up because this is the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.820 
notice I'm going up because this is the
underside<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.430> craft<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.590> gravity<00:01:22.590> would

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
underside of the craft so gravity would

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.920 
underside of the craft so gravity would
make<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.250> streaks<00:01:23.549> flow<00:01:23.820> this<00:01:24.030> way<00:01:24.330> based<00:01:24.659> on

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
make the streaks flow this way based on

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.560 
make the streaks flow this way based on
the<00:01:25.229> curvature<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:26.090> I'm<00:01:27.090> adding<00:01:27.390> some

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
the curvature and I'm adding some

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.330 
the curvature and I'm adding some
streaks<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.990> could<00:01:28.140> add<00:01:28.229> some<00:01:28.439> wider<00:01:28.740> ones<00:01:29.130> if

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
streaks you could add some wider ones if

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.249 
streaks you could add some wider ones if
you<00:01:29.369> need<00:01:29.640> to<00:01:32.180> then<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.390> take<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.689> other<00:01:33.840> fine

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you need to then I take the other fine

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:39.010 
you need to then I take the other fine
brush<00:01:34.670> take<00:01:35.670> some<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> dark<00:01:36.270> rust<00:01:37.820> and

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
brush take some of the dark rust and

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:45.429 
brush take some of the dark rust and
I'll<00:01:40.020> paint<00:01:40.290> some<00:01:40.560> rusty<00:01:41.040> streaks<00:01:43.100> just<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.220> few

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
I'll paint some rusty streaks just a few

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.480 
I'll paint some rusty streaks just a few
alright<00:01:46.439> I'll<00:01:46.890> put<00:01:47.100> one<00:01:47.340> over<00:01:47.369> here<00:01:48.320> and<00:01:49.490> one

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
alright I'll put one over here and one

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.420 
alright I'll put one over here and one
right<00:01:50.520> here<00:01:51.270> going<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> way<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.020> that

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:52.430 
right here going all the way to that

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.569 
right here going all the way to that
alright<00:01:53.430> so<00:01:53.490> we<00:01:54.060> let<00:01:54.240> that<00:01:54.360> dry<00:01:54.689> for<00:01:54.720> a<00:01:55.579> second

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
alright so we let that dry for a second

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.249 
alright so we let that dry for a second
or<00:01:56.700> two<00:01:56.729> till<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> sheen<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.719> starts<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.110> go

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
or two till the sheen just starts to go

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.609 
or two till the sheen just starts to go
away<00:01:59.750> sometimes<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.869> helps<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.110> blow<00:02:01.350> on<00:02:01.590> it

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
away sometimes it helps to blow on it

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.950 
away sometimes it helps to blow on it
and<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.909> we're<00:02:03.030> going<00:02:03.119> to<00:02:03.180> take<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.570> wider

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
and now we're going to take the wider

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.580 
and now we're going to take the wider
brush<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.619> flat<00:02:04.950> brush<00:02:05.869> completely<00:02:06.869> dry<00:02:07.170> no

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
brush the flat brush completely dry no

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.529 
brush the flat brush completely dry no
thinner<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.250> we're<00:02:09.119> going<00:02:09.239> to<00:02:09.270> start

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
thinner and we're going to start

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.770 
thinner and we're going to start
brushing<00:02:10.400> back<00:02:11.400> and<00:02:11.670> forth

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
brushing back and forth

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.270 
brushing back and forth
and<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.230> going<00:02:13.350> to<00:02:13.440> blend<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.920> streaks

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:14.280 
and this is going to blend the streaks

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.560 
and this is going to blend the streaks
in<00:02:15.740> and<00:02:16.740> just<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.430> know<00:02:17.490> kind<00:02:18.120> of<00:02:18.210> whip<00:02:18.420> it

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:18.570 
in and just you know kind of whip it

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.110 
in and just you know kind of whip it
over<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:18.870> surface<00:02:19.080> here<00:02:19.820> lightly<00:02:20.820> brushing

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
over the surface here lightly brushing

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.470 
over the surface here lightly brushing
the<00:02:21.360> surface<00:02:22.220> you<00:02:23.220> can<00:02:23.400> blend<00:02:23.910> away<00:02:24.030> anything

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
the surface you can blend away anything

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.850 
the surface you can blend away anything
that<00:02:24.750> gets<00:02:25.710> messed<00:02:26.040> up<00:02:27.260> you<00:02:28.260> could<00:02:28.380> also<00:02:28.530> take

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that gets messed up you could also take

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.590 
that gets messed up you could also take
the<00:02:29.250> brush<00:02:29.520> with<00:02:29.850> a<00:02:29.880> little<00:02:30.000> bit<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.300> thinner

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
the brush with a little bit of thinner

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.530 
the brush with a little bit of thinner
and<00:02:31.020> if<00:02:31.470> your<00:02:31.590> streak<00:02:31.860> is<00:02:32.040> too<00:02:32.280> wide<00:02:32.580> you<00:02:33.390> don't

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
and if your streak is too wide you don't

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.170 
and if your streak is too wide you don't
like<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.020> you<00:02:34.890> can<00:02:35.100> blend<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.670> away<00:02:35.880> that's<00:02:36.060> the

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
like it you can blend it away that's the

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.390 
like it you can blend it away that's the
great<00:02:36.390> part<00:02:36.600> about<00:02:36.630> oil<00:02:37.020> paints<00:02:37.410> I<00:02:37.590> can<00:02:38.280> take

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
great part about oil paints I can take

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.949 
great part about oil paints I can take
that<00:02:38.520> whole<00:02:38.730> streak<00:02:39.090> away<00:02:39.240> right<00:02:39.540> now<00:02:39.690> in<00:02:39.780> fact

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
that whole streak away right now in fact

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.110 
that whole streak away right now in fact
I'm<00:02:40.080> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.260> take<00:02:40.380> this<00:02:40.560> one<00:02:40.800> away<00:02:41.120> right

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
I'm going to take this one away right

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.760 
I'm going to take this one away right
here<00:02:42.420> this<00:02:42.600> little<00:02:42.720> edge<00:02:42.990> of<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.590> looks

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
here this little edge of it so it looks

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.949 
here this little edge of it so it looks
like<00:02:43.830> it<00:02:44.070> starts<00:02:44.370> there<00:02:44.640> and<00:02:44.850> flows<00:02:45.360> downward

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
like it starts there and flows downward

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.350 
like it starts there and flows downward
now<00:02:46.200> take<00:02:47.070> my<00:02:47.220> brush<00:02:47.489> you<00:02:47.730> know<00:02:47.850> blend<00:02:48.180> that<00:02:48.300> a

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
now take my brush you know blend that a

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.720 
now take my brush you know blend that a
little<00:02:48.630> more<00:02:48.870> whoops<00:02:49.320> blended<00:02:49.830> it<00:02:49.980> mostly

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
little more whoops blended it mostly

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.690 
little more whoops blended it mostly
away<00:02:51.060> wasn't<00:02:51.660> intentional<00:02:52.290> but<00:02:52.470> it<00:02:52.530> works<00:02:52.830> you

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
away wasn't intentional but it works you

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
away wasn't intentional but it works you
could<00:02:53.850> just<00:02:54.090> blend<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:54.420> edges<00:02:54.600> blend<00:02:55.200> the

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
could just blend the edges blend the

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.290 
could just blend the edges blend the
ends<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:55.890> that's<00:02:56.489> it<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.820> got<00:02:56.940> some<00:02:57.120> nice

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
ends and that's it you got some nice

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.229 
ends and that's it you got some nice
subtle<00:02:57.690> streaking<00:02:58.700> what<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.790> don't<00:03:00.000> want<00:03:00.180> to

00:03:00.229 --> 00:03:00.239 
subtle streaking what you don't want to

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.860 
subtle streaking what you don't want to
do<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:01.080> use<00:03:01.470> black<00:03:02.100> paint<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:02.700> really<00:03:03.600> thick

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
do is use black paint and really thick

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.370 
do is use black paint and really thick
streaks<00:03:04.320> and<00:03:05.239> you<00:03:06.239> know<00:03:06.360> go<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.600> town<00:03:06.900> with<00:03:07.200> it

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
streaks and you know go to town with it

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.740 
streaks and you know go to town with it
that<00:03:08.220> worked<00:03:08.580> well<00:03:08.850> for<00:03:08.880> a<00:03:09.209> 30-year<00:03:09.720> old

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
that worked well for a 30-year old

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.170 
that worked well for a 30-year old
studio<00:03:10.260> model<00:03:10.590> for<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> cameras<00:03:11.670> of<00:03:11.850> the<00:03:11.970> day

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.270 
studio model for the cameras of the day
and<00:03:12.540> for<00:03:12.690> what<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:12.989> were<00:03:13.050> doing<00:03:13.500> but<00:03:14.100> for

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
and for what they were doing but for

and for what they were doing but for
something<00:03:14.520> you're<00:03:14.940> looking<00:03:15.270> at<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.780> person

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
something you're looking at in person

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.160 
something you're looking at in person
with<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.519> naked<00:03:17.700> eye<00:03:18.000> you<00:03:18.390> want<00:03:18.930> to<00:03:19.049> be<00:03:19.140> a

with the naked eye you want to be a

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.590 
with the naked eye you want to be a
little<00:03:19.350> more<00:03:19.530> subtle<00:03:19.950> about<00:03:20.070> it

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:20.600 
little more subtle about it

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.850 
little more subtle about it
alright<00:03:21.600> next<00:03:21.900> we're<00:03:22.230> going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.500> some<00:03:22.739> more

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
alright next we're going to do some more

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.550 
alright next we're going to do some more
defined<00:03:23.280> rust<00:03:23.640> and<00:03:24.209> mostly<00:03:25.080> this<00:03:25.260> is<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.500> to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
defined rust and mostly this is going to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.350 
defined rust and mostly this is going to
be<00:03:25.680> applied<00:03:26.070> in<00:03:26.310> areas<00:03:26.700> such<00:03:26.910> as<00:03:26.940> these<00:03:27.239> little

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
be applied in areas such as these little

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.590 
be applied in areas such as these little
engine<00:03:27.840> areas<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.650> along<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.430> edges<00:03:29.600> I'm

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
engine areas and along the edges I'm

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.789 
engine areas and along the edges I'm
going<00:03:30.870> to<00:03:30.930> take<00:03:31.080> a<00:03:31.110> little<00:03:31.290> bit<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.500> thinner

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
going to take a little bit of thinner

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.410 
going to take a little bit of thinner
and<00:03:32.420> make<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.450> thin<00:03:33.750> slurry<00:03:35.120> mastics<00:03:36.120> Lurie

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
and make a thin slurry mastics Lurie

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.590 
and make a thin slurry mastics Lurie

medium thick thin whatever as much as

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.020 
medium thick thin whatever as much as
you<00:03:39.720> need<00:03:39.930> and<00:03:40.739> I'm<00:03:41.070> going<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.670> kind<00:03:41.850> of

you need and I'm going to just kind of

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.210 
you need and I'm going to just kind of
DAB<00:03:42.269> it<00:03:42.510> see<00:03:43.230> that's<00:03:43.380> too<00:03:43.590> thin<00:03:43.890> it's<00:03:44.100> not

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
DAB it see that's too thin it's not

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:46.340 
DAB it see that's too thin it's not
going<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.489> thick<00:03:44.730> enough<00:03:45.000> when<00:03:45.720> they<00:03:45.840> dab<00:03:46.140> it

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
going on thick enough when they dab it

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.000 
going on thick enough when they dab it
in<00:03:46.650> the<00:03:47.280> areas<00:03:47.670> here<00:03:47.880> now<00:03:48.090> it's<00:03:48.299> too<00:03:48.739> thick<00:03:49.739> but

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
in the areas here now it's too thick but

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.670 
in the areas here now it's too thick but
that's<00:03:50.190> great<00:03:50.430> about<00:03:50.549> oil<00:03:50.910> pain<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.299> can<00:03:51.680> you

that's great about oil pain you can you

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.410 
that's great about oil pain you can you
know<00:03:52.799> mess<00:03:53.070> with<00:03:53.280> it<00:03:53.430> wash<00:03:53.700> it<00:03:53.730> away<00:03:54.090> if<00:03:54.239> it's

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
know mess with it wash it away if it's

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.750 
know mess with it wash it away if it's
not<00:03:54.600> right<00:03:54.900> and<00:03:55.230> I'm<00:03:55.829> applying<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.579> there

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.560 
rust isn't exactly you know even it's
got<00:04:04.680> texture<00:04:05.190> it's<00:04:05.459> got<00:04:05.640> different<00:04:05.790> colors<00:04:06.360> in

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
got texture it's got different colors in

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.960 
got texture it's got different colors in
it<00:04:06.600> and<00:04:06.930> they<00:04:07.590> take<00:04:07.829> some<00:04:08.010> the<00:04:08.100> dark<00:04:08.340> rust<00:04:08.670> and

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
it and they take some the dark rust and

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:10.550 
it and they take some the dark rust and
I'm<00:04:09.030> going<00:04:09.180> to<00:04:09.239> apply<00:04:09.450> that<00:04:09.480> over<00:04:10.110> the<00:04:10.320> light

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
I'm going to apply that over the light

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.640 
I'm going to apply that over the light
rust<00:04:10.890> color<00:04:11.209> just<00:04:12.209> in<00:04:12.390> a<00:04:12.480> few<00:04:12.690> areas<00:04:12.870> here<00:04:13.410> some

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
rust color just in a few areas here some

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.699 
rust color just in a few areas here some
places<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.489> might<00:04:14.640> want<00:04:14.880> a<00:04:14.910> little<00:04:15.060> bit<00:04:15.180> more

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
places you might want a little bit more

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.949 
places you might want a little bit more
stipple<00:04:16.709> that<00:04:16.890> in<00:04:17.070> there<00:04:17.340> and<00:04:17.780> then<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:18.870> could

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
stipple that in there and then you could

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.589 
stipple that in there and then you could
take<00:04:19.140> some<00:04:19.380> thinner<00:04:19.680> and<00:04:20.239> you<00:04:21.239> can<00:04:21.390> feather

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:21.599 
take some thinner and you can feather

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:23.480 
take some thinner and you can feather
this<00:04:21.840> out<00:04:22.080> blend<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.830> out<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.010> little<00:04:23.190> bit

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
this out blend it out a little bit

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.830 
this out blend it out a little bit
clean<00:04:23.940> up<00:04:24.120> any<00:04:24.240> areas<00:04:24.539> where<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.080> didn't

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
clean up any areas where you didn't

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.980 
clean up any areas where you didn't
surely<00:04:26.169> one<00:04:26.410> trust<00:04:26.770> and<00:04:27.669> make<00:04:28.570> sure<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.810> don't

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
surely one trust and make sure you don't

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.150 
surely one trust and make sure you don't
have<00:04:29.139> any<00:04:29.350> giant<00:04:29.560> globs<00:04:30.300> once<00:04:31.300> that<00:04:31.510> dries

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.160 
have any giant globs once that dries

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.550 
have any giant globs once that dries
it's<00:04:33.160> going<00:04:33.370> to<00:04:33.430> um<00:04:34.139> the<00:04:35.139> color<00:04:35.260> will<00:04:35.530> change

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
it's going to um the color will change

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:38.520 
it's going to um the color will change
slightly<00:04:35.919> as<00:04:36.190> a<00:04:36.310> dry<00:04:36.610> so<00:04:37.000> as<00:04:37.330> the<00:04:38.080> sheen<00:04:38.290> goes

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
slightly as a dry so as the sheen goes

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:39.780 
slightly as a dry so as the sheen goes
away<00:04:38.800> you'll<00:04:39.040> see<00:04:39.220> what<00:04:39.370> it's<00:04:39.490> going<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.669> look

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
away you'll see what it's going to look

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.460 
away you'll see what it's going to look
like<00:04:39.850> in<00:04:40.180> the<00:04:40.330> end<00:04:40.479> and<00:04:40.780> if<00:04:40.840> you<00:04:40.900> don't<00:04:41.080> like<00:04:41.260> it

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
like in the end and if you don't like it

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.409 
like in the end and if you don't like it
you<00:04:42.040> can<00:04:42.160> take<00:04:42.310> your<00:04:42.430> brush<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.729> you<00:04:43.030> can<00:04:43.210> um

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
you can take your brush and you can um

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.420 
you can take your brush and you can um
with<00:04:43.840> some<00:04:43.960> more<00:04:44.169> thinner<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.680> you<00:04:45.160> can<00:04:45.310> wipe

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
with some more thinner and you can wipe

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.150 
with some more thinner and you can wipe
it<00:04:45.610> all<00:04:45.760> away<00:04:45.790> it's<00:04:46.300> very<00:04:46.440> very<00:04:47.440> easy<00:04:47.560> to<00:04:47.889> do

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:48.160 
it all away it's very very easy to do

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.640 
it all away it's very very easy to do
and<00:04:48.940> I'll<00:04:49.090> do<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.270> in<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:49.990> other<00:04:50.169> engine

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
and I'll do that in the other engine

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.120 
and I'll do that in the other engine
areas<00:04:51.310> around<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:52.150> outside<00:04:52.540> and<00:04:53.130> that's

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:54.130 
areas around the outside and that's

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.570 
areas around the outside and that's
pretty<00:04:54.430> much<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.960> next<00:04:56.250> update<00:04:57.250> is<00:04:57.400> going<00:04:57.430> to

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
pretty much that next update is going to

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.340 
pretty much that next update is going to
be<00:04:57.699> pigment<00:04:58.180> so<00:04:58.330> if<00:04:58.419> you<00:04:58.510> noticed<00:04:58.900> I'm<00:04:59.050> doing<00:04:59.290> a

00:04:59.340 --> 00:04:59.350 
be pigment so if you noticed I'm doing a

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:01.230 
be pigment so if you noticed I'm doing a
lot<00:04:59.470> of<00:04:59.530> my<00:04:59.680> rust<00:05:00.070> and<00:05:00.370> streaks<00:05:00.790> and<00:05:01.000> stuff

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
lot of my rust and streaks and stuff

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.850 
lot of my rust and streaks and stuff
without<00:05:01.540> pigments<00:05:02.229> I'm<00:05:02.350> doing<00:05:02.620> these<00:05:02.740> with

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
without pigments I'm doing these with

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.350 
without pigments I'm doing these with
oil<00:05:03.070> paints<00:05:03.460> because<00:05:03.610> they're<00:05:03.760> very<00:05:03.910> easy<00:05:04.240> to

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.360 
oil paints because they're very easy to

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.210 
oil paints because they're very easy to
control<00:05:04.690> very<00:05:05.139> easy<00:05:05.380> to<00:05:05.590> cleanup<00:05:06.419> pigments

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:08.220 
control very easy to cleanup pigments

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:11.940 
control very easy to cleanup pigments
they<00:05:09.220> can<00:05:09.400> go<00:05:09.520> on<00:05:09.729> very<00:05:10.090> heavy<00:05:10.419> very<00:05:11.080> fast<00:05:11.530> and

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
they can go on very heavy very fast and

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:14.850 
they can go on very heavy very fast and
be<00:05:12.850> very<00:05:13.120> very<00:05:13.570> hard<00:05:13.840> to<00:05:13.990> remove<00:05:14.290> so<00:05:14.590> you<00:05:14.650> might

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:14.860 
be very very hard to remove so you might

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:16.170 
be very very hard to remove so you might
end<00:05:15.040> up<00:05:15.100> screwing<00:05:15.430> up<00:05:15.610> your<00:05:15.760> model<00:05:15.910> or

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
end up screwing up your model or

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.390 
end up screwing up your model or
darkening<00:05:16.600> it<00:05:16.750> too<00:05:16.900> much<00:05:17.110> that's<00:05:17.889> why<00:05:18.070> I<00:05:18.100> saved

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:18.400 
darkening it too much that's why I saved

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.740 
darkening it too much that's why I saved
them<00:05:18.550> to<00:05:18.669> the<00:05:18.760> end<00:05:18.910> and<00:05:19.090> when<00:05:19.180> I<00:05:19.210> apply<00:05:19.510> them

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
them to the end and when I apply them

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:21.330 
them to the end and when I apply them
I'm<00:05:19.810> going<00:05:19.930> to<00:05:19.990> apply<00:05:20.169> them<00:05:20.440> very<00:05:20.860> very

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
I'm going to apply them very very

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.230 
I'm going to apply them very very
lightly<00:05:22.169> but<00:05:23.169> that's<00:05:23.320> next<00:05:23.590> time<00:05:23.830> for<00:05:24.789> now<00:05:24.910> I'm

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:25.240 
lightly but that's next time for now I'm

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.580 
lightly but that's next time for now I'm
going<00:05:25.419> to<00:05:25.479> finish<00:05:25.720> the<00:05:25.870> streaks<00:05:26.169> over<00:05:26.500> the

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
going to finish the streaks over the

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.550 
going to finish the streaks over the
rest<00:05:26.770> of<00:05:26.860> the<00:05:26.949> model<00:05:27.340> let<00:05:27.880> this<00:05:28.060> dry<00:05:28.419> and<00:05:28.720> I'll

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
rest of the model let this dry and I'll

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:33.090 
rest of the model let this dry and I'll
see<00:05:29.830> you<00:05:29.919> next<00:05:30.160> time<00:05:30.280> happy<00:05:30.580> modelling
