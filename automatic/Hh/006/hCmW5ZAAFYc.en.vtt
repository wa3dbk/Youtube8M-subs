and<00:01:31.619> there's<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.009> nice<00:01:32.159> twist<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.759> but

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
and there's a nice twist to this but

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.130 
and there's a nice twist to this but
another<00:01:33.090> thing<00:01:33.420> that's<00:01:33.630> interesting<00:01:33.780> the

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
another thing that's interesting the

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.020 
another thing that's interesting the
note<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> when<00:01:34.950> he<00:01:35.159> destroyed<00:01:35.549> parts<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.939> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
note is when he destroyed parts of the

that much and actually show us a little

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.920 
that much and actually show us a little
bit<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.700> what<00:01:44.880> poof<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.360> doing<00:01:45.689> here

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
he's actually not going through a

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.160 
he's actually not going through a
transformation<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.540> actually<00:01:48.659> thought<00:01:48.990> that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
transformation I actually thought that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.270 
transformation I actually thought that
what<00:01:49.439> they<00:01:49.530> were<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.829> do<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.250> know

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
what they were going to do and you know

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.800 
what they were going to do and you know
what<00:01:50.549> I'm<00:01:50.729> gonna<00:01:50.820> give<00:01:51.000> him<00:01:51.149> a<00:01:51.180> thumbs<00:01:51.420> up<00:01:51.630> for

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
what I'm gonna give him a thumbs up for

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.870 
what I'm gonna give him a thumbs up for
that<00:01:51.960> because<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:53.399> would<00:01:53.549> have<00:01:53.640> been<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
that because that would have been the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
that because that would have been the
stereotypical<00:01:54.509> thing<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.229> do<00:01:55.380> is<00:01:55.560> to<00:01:55.590> make<00:01:55.799> him

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
stereotypical thing to do is to make him

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.520 
stereotypical thing to do is to make him
transform<00:01:56.340> into<00:01:56.610> some<00:01:56.790> weird<00:01:56.939> freaky

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
transform into some weird freaky

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.719 
transform into some weird freaky
butterfly<00:01:58.530> creature<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.159> no<00:01:59.310> he's<00:01:59.520> actually

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
butterfly creature but no he's actually

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.910 
butterfly creature but no he's actually
like<00:02:00.060> turning<00:02:00.450> his<00:02:00.600> body<00:02:00.869> into<00:02:01.530> these<00:02:01.680> like

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
like turning his body into these like

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
like turning his body into these like
millions<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.670> tiny<00:02:02.939> little<00:02:03.180> insects<00:02:03.719> which

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
millions of tiny little insects which

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.899 
millions of tiny little insects which
are<00:02:04.079> able<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.590> escape<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:05.130> little<00:02:05.549> bit<00:02:05.729> at<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
are able to escape a little bit at a

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:08.660 
are able to escape a little bit at a
time<00:02:06.000> out<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.899> this<00:02:07.020> smoke<00:02:07.590> place<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.190> morel

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
time out of this smoke place and morel

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.669 
time out of this smoke place and morel
is<00:02:08.849> not<00:02:09.000> able<00:02:09.149> to<00:02:09.360> notice<00:02:09.690> this<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.470> I'm

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
is not able to notice this so I'm

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.110 
is not able to notice this so I'm
guessing<00:02:10.890> he's<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.370> end<00:02:11.489> up<00:02:11.580> tricking

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
guessing he's going to end up tricking

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.430 
guessing he's going to end up tricking
somehow<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.540> bigger<00:02:12.780> question<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.260> who's

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
somehow the bigger question is who's

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.440 
somehow the bigger question is who's
going<00:02:13.590> to<00:02:13.680> fight<00:02:13.890> against<00:02:14.190> poof<00:02:14.400> but<00:02:15.120> let's<00:02:15.330> go
