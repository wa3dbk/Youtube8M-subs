00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
what what happens what tends to happen

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.819 
what what happens what tends to happen
is<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> turd<00:00:45.329> on<00:00:45.480> your<00:00:45.600> side<00:00:45.840> when<00:00:46.559> a

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is with that turd on your side when a

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.869 
is with that turd on your side when a
splicer<00:00:47.610> just<00:00:47.879> wanders<00:00:48.690> by<00:00:49.219> it<00:00:50.219> will<00:00:50.489> shoot

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
splicer just wanders by it will shoot

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.950 
splicer just wanders by it will shoot
them<00:00:51.090> and<00:00:52.610> there's<00:00:53.610> a<00:00:53.699> tendency<00:00:53.969> for<00:00:54.180> it<00:00:54.629> to

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
them and there's a tendency for it to

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.990 
them and there's a tendency for it to
hit<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.320> barrels<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> explode<00:00:56.550> them<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
hit the barrels and explode them and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.220 
hit the barrels and explode them and
waste<00:00:57.329> them<00:00:57.570> when<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.930> could<00:00:58.079> have<00:00:58.170> easily

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
waste them when you could have easily

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.549 
waste them when you could have easily
use<00:00:58.590> them<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.010> other<00:00:59.870> more<00:01:00.870> nefarious<00:01:01.020> you

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
use them for other more nefarious you

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.280 
use them for other more nefarious you
know<00:01:01.680> purposes<00:01:02.219> are<00:01:02.430> various<00:01:02.760> yeah<00:01:02.940> so<00:01:03.290> what

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
know purposes are various yeah so what

we're going to do here is kind of get

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.130 
we're going to do here is kind of get
behind<00:01:08.580> the<00:01:08.880> Big<00:01:09.390> Daddy<00:01:09.600> because<00:01:09.840> we<00:01:09.930> need<00:01:10.049> to

get upstairs and once upstairs we're

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.899 
get upstairs and once upstairs we're
going<00:01:13.260> to<00:01:13.409> kind<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.650> rush<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.340> this<00:01:14.549> treasure

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
going to kind of rush to this treasure

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.300 
going to kind of rush to this treasure
trove<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.479> explosive<00:01:15.990> barrels<00:01:16.409> and

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
trove of explosive barrels and

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.780 
trove of explosive barrels and
ammunition<00:01:18.380> and<00:01:19.380> attack<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.070> Big<00:01:20.220> Daddy<00:01:20.430> from

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
ammunition and attack the Big Daddy from

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.230 
ammunition and attack the Big Daddy from
up<00:01:21.000> top<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.070> this<00:01:23.070> strategy<00:01:23.520> tends<00:01:23.909> to<00:01:24.090> work

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
up top and this strategy tends to work

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.380 
up top and this strategy tends to work
much<00:01:25.170> more<00:01:25.500> and<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:26.640> very<00:01:26.909> effective

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
much more and it's very effective

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
much more and it's very effective
because<00:01:27.540> nine<00:01:28.439> times<00:01:28.470> out<00:01:28.799> of<00:01:28.829> ten<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.250> big

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because nine times out of ten the big

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.620 
because nine times out of ten the big
daddy's<00:01:29.700> going<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> rush<00:01:30.119> into<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.420> pool

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
daddy's going to rush into the pool

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.429 
daddy's going to rush into the pool
where<00:01:30.930> you<00:01:31.680> can<00:01:31.920> continuously<00:01:32.490> shock<00:01:32.939> him<00:01:33.210> and

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:33.439 
where you can continuously shock him and

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:36.160 
where you can continuously shock him and
unload<00:01:34.439> your<00:01:34.560> heavy<00:01:34.829> rivets<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.310> him<00:01:35.520> I'd

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.170 
unload your heavy rivets on him I'd

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.510 
unload your heavy rivets on him I'd
recommend<00:01:37.170> you<00:01:37.470> guys<00:01:37.650> have<00:01:37.860> max<00:01:38.130> out<00:01:38.310> heavy

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
recommend you guys have max out heavy

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.819 
recommend you guys have max out heavy
rivets<00:01:38.820> for<00:01:38.939> this<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> don't<00:01:39.390> need<00:01:39.630> them<00:01:39.829> but

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
rivets for this you don't need them but

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.069 
rivets for this you don't need them but
it<00:01:41.189> definitely<00:01:41.369> helps<00:01:41.820> so<00:01:44.810> what<00:01:45.810> we're<00:01:45.990> going

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
it definitely helps so what we're going

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.859 
it definitely helps so what we're going
to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:47.060> attack<00:01:48.060> him<00:01:48.210> from<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.479> high<00:01:48.630> with

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to do is attack him from on high with

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.480 
to do is attack him from on high with
explosive<00:01:49.290> barrels<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.890> then<00:01:50.070> kind<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
explosive barrels and then kind of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:51.940 
explosive barrels and then kind of
finish<00:01:50.759> him<00:01:50.909> off<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.299> rivets<00:01:51.780> and

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
finish him off with rivets and

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.109 
finish him off with rivets and
electroshock<00:01:53.840> the<00:01:54.840> only<00:01:55.170> downside<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.799> that

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:56.119 
electroshock the only downside is that

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:58.429 
electroshock the only downside is that
he<00:01:57.119> has<00:01:57.270> a<00:01:57.299> tendency<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.869> once<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.200> hand<00:01:58.320> with

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
he has a tendency of once you hand with

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.560 
he has a tendency of once you hand with
a<00:01:58.500> barrel<00:01:58.740> tier<00:01:58.890> under<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.310> bridge<00:01:59.570> which

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
a barrel tier under this bridge which

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.389 
a barrel tier under this bridge which
makes<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.020> increasingly<00:02:01.500> difficult<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:02.280> hit

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
makes it increasingly difficult to hit

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.030 
makes it increasingly difficult to hit
him<00:02:02.520> with<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.670> barrel<00:02:03.090> so<00:02:03.329> I<00:02:03.500> recommend<00:02:04.500> you<00:02:04.890> get

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
him with a barrel so I recommend you get

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.190 
him with a barrel so I recommend you get
these<00:02:05.130> barrels<00:02:05.520> out<00:02:05.640> early<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.960> don't

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 
these barrels out early I don't

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.420 
these barrels out early I don't
I<00:02:08.259> have<00:02:08.619> to<00:02:08.770> kind<00:02:08.979> of<00:02:10.709> snipe<00:02:11.709> these<00:02:12.010> barrels

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
I have to kind of snipe these barrels

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.699 
I have to kind of snipe these barrels
atom<00:02:12.790> which<00:02:13.030> I'm<00:02:13.390> surprised<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:14.110> hit<00:02:14.470> them<00:02:14.560> all

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
atom which I'm surprised I hit them all

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.020 
atom which I'm surprised I hit them all
three<00:02:14.950> times<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.430> I'm<00:02:15.519> frankly<00:02:15.879> I'm

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
three times and I'm frankly I'm

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.470 
three times and I'm frankly I'm
surprised<00:02:16.390> I<00:02:16.569> even<00:02:16.810> have<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.560> so<00:02:18.480> once

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
surprised I even have to do that so once

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.030 
surprised I even have to do that so once
you<00:02:19.660> hit<00:02:19.840> him<00:02:20.019> in<00:02:20.140> his<00:02:20.170> main<00:02:20.440> area<00:02:20.739> with<00:02:20.920> the

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
you hit him in his main area with the

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.410 
you hit him in his main area with the
first<00:02:21.220> barrel<00:02:21.580> that<00:02:21.849> will<00:02:21.970> trigger<00:02:22.300> the

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
first barrel that will trigger the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.080 
first barrel that will trigger the
camera<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:23.319> don't<00:02:23.769> be<00:02:23.860> distracted<00:02:24.190> for<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
camera and don't be distracted for a

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.410 
camera and don't be distracted for a
good<00:02:25.690> while<00:02:25.870> so<00:02:26.580> user<00:02:27.580> three<00:02:27.880> barrels<00:02:28.269> and

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
good while so user three barrels and

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.449 
good while so user three barrels and
this<00:02:28.510> is<00:02:28.599> the<00:02:28.660> one<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:28.810> think<00:02:28.900> I<00:02:29.200> snipe<00:02:29.620> I<00:02:29.860> can't

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
this is the one I think I snipe I can't

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.289 
this is the one I think I snipe I can't
believe<00:02:30.610> I<00:02:30.760> get<00:02:30.910> into<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.269> bridge<00:02:31.870> but<00:02:32.769> I<00:02:32.860> do

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
believe I get into this bridge but I do

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:37.860 
believe I get into this bridge but I do
but<00:02:34.299> uh<00:02:35.099> it's<00:02:36.099> very<00:02:36.489> easy<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.880> just<00:02:37.660> shoot<00:02:37.750> them

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
but uh it's very easy to just shoot them

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.960 
but uh it's very easy to just shoot them
and<00:02:38.140> he's<00:02:38.260> almost<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.650> know<00:02:38.830> half<00:02:39.220> dead<00:02:39.640> here

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
and he's almost you know half dead here

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.240 
and he's almost you know half dead here
so<00:02:40.690> once<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:41.380> happens<00:02:41.890> once<00:02:42.130> you've

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
so once that happens once you've

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.670 
so once that happens once you've
unloaded<00:02:42.489> that<00:02:42.730> third<00:02:42.910> barrel<00:02:43.500> just<00:02:44.500> heavy

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
unloaded that third barrel just heavy

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.949 
unloaded that third barrel just heavy
rivet<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.250> shock<00:02:45.640> him<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.060> it's<00:02:46.810> a

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
rivet and shock him and it's a

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.890 
rivet and shock him and it's a
straightforward<00:02:47.380> fight<00:02:47.920> it's<00:02:48.630> pretty<00:02:49.630> simple

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:49.900 
straightforward fight it's pretty simple

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.750 
straightforward fight it's pretty simple
so<00:02:50.170> go<00:02:50.319> down<00:02:50.470> very<00:02:50.680> easily<00:02:50.920> and<00:02:51.340> this<00:02:51.640> is

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
so go down very easily and this is

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.520 
so go down very easily and this is
probably<00:02:52.090> easy<00:02:52.420> it's<00:02:52.599> gonna<00:02:52.690> get<00:02:52.959> until<00:02:53.200> the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
probably easy it's gonna get until the

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.009 
probably easy it's gonna get until the
road<00:02:53.769> ash<00:02:53.920> gets<00:02:54.160> a<00:02:54.280> little<00:02:54.370> more<00:02:54.549> colorful<00:02:55.060> so

00:02:56.009 --> 00:02:56.019 
road ash gets a little more colorful so

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:02.819 
road ash gets a little more colorful so
he<00:02:56.739> goes<00:02:56.890> down<00:02:57.870> boom<00:02:58.870> and<00:03:00.900> you<00:03:01.900> drop<00:03:02.140> down<00:03:02.349> and

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
he goes down boom and you drop down and

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.280 
he goes down boom and you drop down and
I<00:03:03.400> get<00:03:03.730> yourself<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.150> sister<00:03:04.510> and<00:03:04.930> then<00:03:05.170> the

above and across so anything you see
happening<00:04:24.190> to<00:04:24.490> me<00:04:24.670> is<00:04:24.730> you<00:04:25.120> know<00:04:25.150> guaranteed

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
happening to me is you know guaranteed

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.240 
happening to me is you know guaranteed
did<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:26.140> know<00:04:26.230> almost<00:04:26.440> happened<00:04:26.800> to<00:04:26.830> you<00:04:26.980> so

just<00:04:27.460> keep<00:04:28.150> an<00:04:28.330> eye<00:04:28.450> out<00:04:28.480> they<00:04:28.900> don't<00:04:29.080> deal

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
just keep an eye out they don't deal

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:30.450 
just keep an eye out they don't deal
with<00:04:29.320> hunter<00:04:29.560> damage<00:04:29.890> and<00:04:30.190> they<00:04:30.340> almost

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
always Rob down to the water anyway so

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.640 
always Rob down to the water anyway so
you<00:04:32.770> can<00:04:32.890> shock<00:04:33.130> them<00:04:33.780> but<00:04:34.780> they<00:04:35.290> might<00:04:35.440> get<00:04:35.590> a

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
you can shock them but they might get a

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:37.980 
you can shock them but they might get a
few<00:04:35.740> you<00:04:36.220> know<00:04:36.250> who's<00:04:36.610> he<00:04:36.730> hits<00:04:36.910> on<00:04:37.060> you<00:04:37.300> but

few you know who's he hits on you but

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.480 
few you know who's he hits on you but
it's<00:04:38.140> not<00:04:38.230> too<00:04:38.650> big<00:04:38.770> of<00:04:38.890> a<00:04:38.950> deal<00:04:39.100> this<00:04:39.190> is<00:04:39.370> a

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:39.490 
it's not too big of a deal this is a

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.100
