 games borderlands 2 and the first easter eggs on 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.610
 Today, this is a reference to donkey kong 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.160
 sorry in Russian localization up 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.020
 Immediately understand that this Easter egg 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.000
 Donkey munch appears quite difficult 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.800
 harmed and the sea is strictly doing 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.710
 the place you saw on the map 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 after defeating him, you will get an improvement 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.739
 that's all and go to the next 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.020
 Easter egg 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.179
 it's hard to call the next package 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.609
 easter eggs most likely it's just 

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:50.149
 watchfulness darma ironies can 

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:53.249
 find such from lecherous portraits 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:55.589
 robots yes yes do not be surprised 

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:59.129
 exactly robots and find on the bed 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.879
 piece of iron oil what did he do with these 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.839
 posters 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.550
 not known better not to know about it 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:08.310
 The next Easter egg has its own story 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.430
 pretty sad story devoted to 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.420
 a man named michael moril who 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.909
 was a fan 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.640
 board games unfortunately maykov 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.670
 passed away in October 2011 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.580
 but he stayed alive forever in the game 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.640
 borderlands 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.700
 through the efforts of the developers character 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.010
 michael lives and helps seeker 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:34.000
 haven meet michael's character 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:36.610
 the game is very difficult but worth it as 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.730
 only you will find he will immediately give you 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.670
 the weapon and with it will issue an achivka 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.550
 ordinary fan thanks to the efforts of a friend 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.010
 and the developers were able to continue their 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:51.100
 game life for it game developers 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.690
 deserve at least respect on us with 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.030
 you go to the next easter egg 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:57.890
 It is a location that looked bunker 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.680
 you need to look at the location of a hectare of morph 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.990
 two or three minutes you can see such 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.810
 funny dance of this giant monster 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.729
 Well, as the music in the game according to dance 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.270
 it was not envisaged I decided to add 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.270
 their 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.069
 down 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.069
 thought 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.570

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.239
 dangerous dance trick 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:31.280

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:33.980
