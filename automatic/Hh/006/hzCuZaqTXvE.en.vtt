00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello everyone with you cola maxima points 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.380
 This is a review of heavy games on a smartphone. 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:11.790
 lenovo 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:16.139
 and 536 the first game real racing 3 we estimate 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:20.720
 download speed and graphics and of course 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.720
 smoothly from work and gameplay in general 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.079
 The game started this video, we will miss 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.150
 immediately see that there is a display 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.460
 in the mirror but drawing the graphics on 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:13.060
 how much can already be judged approximately 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:16.320
 on average, the smoothness of the game is high 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.500
 probably enough comparable to iPhones 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.720
 graphics 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.630
 I repeat again at the middle level now 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:27.369
 this is already seen more clearly change the view 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:32.280
 the game goes absolutely smoothly see what 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:34.570
 there is smoke sand from under the wheels the game is not 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.580
 slows down even when cars are near 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:39.119
 everything goes absolutely smoothly to play 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.119
 comfortable 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:50.460
 so here we go in the next game 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.010
 this we close the following plays 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.870
 asphalt 8 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.710
 also gonochki but slightly others 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.710
 other manufacturer 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.530
 so close it 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.530
 and begin 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.700
 with gru 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.080
 the game started quickly 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.489
 here 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.260
 graphics at a good level we see that 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.010
 there are no effects in case of accidents here 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.660
 when you crash into another car on 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.630
 other smartphones I know for example 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.910
 iPhone has a lot of it 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:16.770
 various effects here graphics are also on 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.790
 average level as in real racing but 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.240
 everything goes just as smoothly with this 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.240
 no problem 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:33.970
 everything works fine to play comfortably 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:47.280
 close asphalt 8 and move to the third 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:47.280
 game dead trigger 2 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.390
 Do wait until the trigger starts 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:25.400
 here's a welcome video of him 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.400
 can not be missed but it is short 

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.930
 it means it will glow all sorts of 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:58.070
 account and now Iâ€™ll check to 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:58.070
 jumped out like everything is fine 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.629
 starts up 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.629
 d-trigger 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.490
 graphics are also stripped down 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:35.280
 not at maximum settings but all 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:38.820
 it goes absolutely smoothly even very 

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.820
 absolutely no problems 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.890
 all perfectly 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.520
 It is played as well, that is, everything 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.370
 heavy toys that are now in 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:06:00.040
 Play market will be here without lags on 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:06.310
 this smartphone is well optimized all 

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:07.200
 fine here we see that he is without any 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:09.880
 of problems 

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.680
