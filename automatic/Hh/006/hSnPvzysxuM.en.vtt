hello everybody I'm just gonna do a

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.170 
hello everybody I'm just gonna do a
comparison<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.350> a<00:00:04.680> stereo<00:00:05.160> wet<00:00:05.430> reverb<00:00:05.850> and

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:26.470 
and here's a stereo reverb statement

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:38.860 
and here's a stereo reverb statement
software

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:50.810 

and<00:00:39.870> here's<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.500> Superman<00:00:49.399> just<00:00:50.399> gonna<00:00:50.579> take

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and here's a Superman just gonna take

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
and here's a Superman just gonna take
out<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> sway<00:00:51.479> knob<00:00:51.780> on<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.619> Superman

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
out the sway knob on the Superman

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
out the sway knob on the Superman
because<00:00:53.610> it's<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.909> modulation<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.869> is<00:00:55.019> set

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
because it's a modulation this is set

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.849 
because it's a modulation this is set
for<00:00:55.229> tone<00:00:55.530> up<00:00:55.710> on<00:00:55.949> the<00:00:57.260> steerer<00:00:58.260> Weaver<00:00:58.649> break

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
for tone up on the steerer Weaver break

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.289 
for tone up on the steerer Weaver break
now<00:00:59.039> and<00:00:59.399> I'm<00:00:59.670> just<00:00:59.699> going<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:01.879> do<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.909> quick

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:03.299 
now and I'm just going to do a quick

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.570 
now and I'm just going to do a quick
little<00:01:06.440> plucking<00:01:07.440> pattern<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.429> can

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
little plucking pattern just so you can

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.880 
little plucking pattern just so you can
see<00:01:08.819> maybe<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.119> little<00:01:09.210> difference<00:01:09.750> so<00:01:10.020> without

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
see maybe a little difference so without

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:30.140 
see maybe a little difference so without
anything

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.630 

just<00:01:31.150> real<00:01:31.330> quickly<00:01:32.100> how<00:01:33.100> they<00:01:33.280> decay

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
just real quickly how they decay

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:48.420 
just real quickly how they decay
differently<00:01:37.980> once<00:01:38.980> again<00:01:47.430> slightly

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
differently once again slightly

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.660 
differently once again slightly
different<00:01:48.670> feel<00:01:48.820> the<00:01:49.150> decay<00:01:49.450> there<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.610> I'm

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
different feel the decay there and I'm

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.220 
different feel the decay there and I'm
gonna<00:01:51.760> turn<00:01:52.090> up<00:01:52.150> the<00:01:52.300> depth<00:01:52.630> for<00:01:52.810> a<00:01:52.900> little<00:01:53.140> bit

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:53.230 
gonna turn up the depth for a little bit

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.490 
gonna turn up the depth for a little bit
of<00:01:53.410> more<00:01:53.620> of<00:01:53.650> an<00:01:53.800> ambient<00:01:54.310> sound<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:56.020> mix<00:01:56.290> a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
of more of an ambient sound the mix a

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.320 
of more of an ambient sound the mix a
little<00:01:56.740> bit<00:01:56.830> as<00:01:56.950> well<00:01:57.160> and<00:01:59.610> do<00:02:00.610> the<00:02:00.729> stereo<00:02:01.119> wit

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:01.330 
little bit as well and do the stereo wit

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:22.610 
little bit as well and do the stereo wit
with<00:02:02.290> a<00:02:02.320> little<00:02:02.650> bit<00:02:02.770> of<00:02:02.800> a<00:02:02.920> picking<00:02:03.250> pattern

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.120 

and<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:25.330> bit<00:02:25.930> more<00:02:26.110> decay<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.770> I'm<00:02:26.890> going<00:02:27.040> to

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
and a bit more decay and I'm going to

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:28.740 
and a bit more decay and I'm going to
add<00:02:27.280> a<00:02:27.310> little<00:02:27.610> bit<00:02:27.819> of<00:02:27.850> modulation<00:02:28.330> into<00:02:28.660> the

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
add a little bit of modulation into the

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.449 
add a little bit of modulation into the
super<00:02:29.050> mound<00:02:29.260> so<00:02:29.709> you<00:02:29.800> can<00:02:29.920> see<00:02:30.160> what<00:02:30.340> it's

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
super mound so you can see what it's

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:51.119 
super mound so you can see what it's
capable<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:31.470> same<00:02:32.470> picking<00:02:32.709> pattern

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:53.380 

I'm<00:02:52.129> gonna<00:02:52.340> also<00:02:52.609> show<00:02:52.909> you<00:02:52.969> where<00:02:53.239> they

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
I'm gonna also show you where they

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.500 
I'm gonna also show you where they
differ<00:02:54.099> when<00:02:55.099> you're<00:02:55.310> strumming<00:02:55.849> a<00:02:56.090> bit<00:02:56.269> more

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
differ when you're strumming a bit more

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.979 
differ when you're strumming a bit more
just<00:02:57.260> to<00:02:57.379> give<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:57.920> a<00:02:57.950> little<00:02:58.099> bit<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.340> an<00:02:58.430> idea

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
just to give you a little bit of an idea

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:05.800 
just to give you a little bit of an idea
how<00:02:59.989> they<00:03:00.140> the<00:03:03.370> reverberation<00:03:04.450> sits<00:03:05.450> in<00:03:05.719> the

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
how they the reverberation sits in the

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:43.140 
how they the reverberation sits in the
mix<00:03:06.049> of<00:03:06.260> strumming<00:03:06.590> for<00:03:07.099> rhythm<00:03:07.250> players

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:43.150 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.899 

and<00:03:44.319> I'm<00:03:45.319> just<00:03:45.500> gonna<00:03:45.620> do<00:03:45.890> swells<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:46.549> compare

00:03:46.899 --> 00:03:46.909 
and I'm just gonna do swells to compare

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:50.020 
and I'm just gonna do swells to compare
them<00:03:47.090> in<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.989> sort<00:03:48.590> of<00:03:48.650> modes<00:03:48.920> that<00:03:49.159> I<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.459> to

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
them in the sort of modes that I like to

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.130 
them in the sort of modes that I like to
do<00:03:50.620> volume<00:03:51.620> swells<00:03:51.890> with<00:03:52.190> them<00:03:52.690> so<00:03:53.690> here's<00:03:53.900> a

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
do volume swells with them so here's a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:16.020 
do volume swells with them so here's a
little<00:03:54.379> bit<00:03:54.560> of<00:03:54.650> a<00:03:54.709> swell<00:03:55.010> with<00:03:55.940> the<00:03:57.549> stairway

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.680 

and<00:04:17.030> of<00:04:17.120> course<00:04:17.359> the<00:04:17.600> wet<00:04:18.850> trails<00:04:19.850> up<00:04:20.090> nicely

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
and of course the wet trails up nicely

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:22.810 
and of course the wet trails up nicely
after<00:04:20.900> you<00:04:21.289> shut<00:04:21.530> it<00:04:21.560> off<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.100> super<00:04:22.400> moon<00:04:22.580> is

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
after you shut it off the super moon is

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:52.770 
after you shut it off the super moon is
a<00:04:22.910> brown<00:04:23.389> abrupt<00:04:26.229> and<00:04:27.229> here's<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.710> Superman

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:57.219 

and<00:04:53.780> I'm<00:04:53.930> going<00:04:54.050> to<00:04:54.110> use<00:04:54.229> El<00:04:54.500> Cap<00:04:55.300> delay<00:04:56.300> just

00:04:57.219 --> 00:04:57.229 
and I'm going to use El Cap delay just

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:00.939 
and I'm going to use El Cap delay just
for<00:04:57.410> a<00:04:57.440> little<00:04:57.740> bit<00:04:57.860> of<00:04:59.380> what<00:05:00.380> it's<00:05:00.500> like<00:05:00.590> with

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949 
for a little bit of what it's like with

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:04.570 
for a little bit of what it's like with
a<00:05:01.550> delay<00:05:02.000> pedal<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:03.320> is<00:05:03.470> a<00:05:03.500> tape<00:05:03.830> delay<00:05:04.070> however

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
a delay pedal it is a tape delay however

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:07.719 
a delay pedal it is a tape delay however
I've<00:05:05.139> pulled<00:05:06.139> out<00:05:06.320> all<00:05:06.560> the<00:05:06.620> tape<00:05:07.070> age<00:05:07.310> so<00:05:07.610> it

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
I've pulled out all the tape age so it

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:09.760 
I've pulled out all the tape age so it
should<00:05:07.970> be<00:05:08.000> like<00:05:08.210> a<00:05:08.240> new<00:05:08.449> tape<00:05:08.690> and<00:05:08.960> without

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
should be like a new tape and without

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.270 
should be like a new tape and without
any<00:05:10.009> Wow<00:05:10.160> and<00:05:10.490> flutter<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:12.380> here's<00:05:12.800> just<00:05:13.099> the

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
any Wow and flutter and here's just the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:06:09.820 
any Wow and flutter and here's just the
delay

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:09.830 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:14.270 

there<00:06:10.830> you<00:06:10.920> have<00:06:11.070> it<00:06:11.100> thanks<00:06:11.820> for<00:06:11.850> watching
