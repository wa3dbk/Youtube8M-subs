00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.060
 2:46 pm in the middle 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.060
 Welcome to that moment 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.200
 Huge earthquake with a maximum seismic intensity of 7 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.500
 Pedestrian figure squatting down to much shaking 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.470
 Hmm 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 About one hour before 4:00 pm 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:40.120
 It was when the car stopped in a traffic jam 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:45.390
 From the left of the screen 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.390
 Some cars are swept away by the tsunami 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.579
 Kara choral part 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:57.970
 Now O'surging tsunami from behind 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:08.100
 Only 10 seconds how the tsunami has reached the car 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:08.100
 Mr. Muroga's car begins to be pushed forward gradually 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:22.380
 And after 25 seconds the car is completely lifted 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.380
 I lose control and begin to drift 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 At this time, Muroga's'm still had stopped in-house 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:36.710
 Mr. Muroga's car goes on a black wagon ahead 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.390
 There are men in the crowd 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.460
 You have 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.479
 Hmm 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.100
 I thought about running away right after this collision 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.939
 That the window was opened 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.939
 Delusion to Bailly 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:07.110
 While debris and cars in front of the screen slowly flow in the right direction 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:09.170
 The truck is swept to the left at a tremendous speed in the face 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.170
 Oh 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:16.810
 Good man in a crashed wagon 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:18.430
 I also see evacuation on the car 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.319
 Not standing 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.630
 I was just saying 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:28.140
 And slowly the car to change the orientation 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.760
 Then the camera rushes from between the buildings 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.760
 Hami c caught the flow 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.530
 It is in full horse tell the damage of the tsunami that occurred in a different location broadcast gar 

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.390
 Human being 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.750
 I received working 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:03:00.690
 It is said that Uroga kept thinking whether it escapes from five cars in the company at this time 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:04.490
 Without someone of our company 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.890
 And about 4 minutes after beginning to be washed away 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.440
 Becoming acted 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.440
 I was caught in a fast flowing stream 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.129
 I thought 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:39.020
 Fluma shaken up and down a lot 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.020
 I was in another car in front of me 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:53.850
 Mr. Muroka left behind the car that started to rotate 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.850
 Tsunami continues to be swept away 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.540
 Have 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:12.340
 And 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.340
 About 4 minutes from the tsunami encounter 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:25.210
 Where a car collides with a building and sinks into the water 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.210
 The picture was broken
