apart<00:01:12.210> somewhere<00:01:12.930> in<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.080> triangle<00:01:13.680> they're

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
apart somewhere in that triangle they're

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.910 
apart somewhere in that triangle they're
either<00:01:14.310> not<00:01:14.580> competent<00:01:15.330> not<00:01:15.840> confident<00:01:16.530> all

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
either not competent not confident all

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.590 
either not competent not confident all
right<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.250> if<00:01:17.580> either<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:17.880> those<00:01:18.090> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.390> case

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
right and if either of those is the case

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.330 
right and if either of those is the case
those<00:01:18.900> things<00:01:19.140> need<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.380> be<00:01:19.500> repaired<00:01:19.890> because

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
those things need to be repaired because

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.429 
those things need to be repaired because
they're<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.939> to<00:01:21.150> have<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.750> believe<00:01:22.140> that

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
they're going to have to believe that

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.960 
they're going to have to believe that
they're<00:01:22.590> going<00:01:22.770> to<00:01:22.950> get<00:01:23.070> there<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.490> they<00:01:23.790> will

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
they're going to get there or they will

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.140 
they're going to get there or they will
quit<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.659> route<00:01:25.259> next<00:01:26.100> up<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.640> third<00:01:26.880> piece

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
quit and route next up the third piece

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.980 
quit and route next up the third piece
is<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.840> begin<00:01:28.520> almost<00:01:29.520> all<00:01:29.700> projects<00:01:30.240> fail<00:01:30.720> to

they program themselves to always

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.930 
they program themselves to always
continue<00:02:04.530> until<00:02:05.460> step<00:02:06.329> 5<00:02:06.659> they<00:02:07.049> finish<00:02:07.940> they

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
going to take to get done and then you

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.730 
going to take to get done and then you
do<00:02:27.970> it<00:02:28.120> today<00:02:28.570> while<00:02:29.050> you<00:02:29.290> have<00:02:29.530> those

something<00:02:38.320> you<00:02:38.470> begin<00:02:38.950> it<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.780> you've

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:40.780 
something you begin it and you've

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.060 
something you begin it and you've
decided<00:02:41.140> you're<00:02:41.320> going<00:02:41.500> to<00:02:41.560> get<00:02:41.680> this<00:02:41.800> done

the five step formula for accomplishment
is<00:02:59.110> see<00:02:59.650> it<00:02:59.790> believe<00:03:00.790> it<00:03:00.850> that<00:03:01.420> requires<00:03:01.870> that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
is see it believe it that requires that
