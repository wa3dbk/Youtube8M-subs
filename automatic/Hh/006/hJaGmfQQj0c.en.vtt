done<00:03:30.770> this<00:03:30.950> but<00:03:32.440> in<00:03:33.440> fact<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.830> Challenger

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
done this but in fact the Challenger

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.800 
done this but in fact the Challenger
looks<00:03:34.430> very<00:03:34.640> similar<00:03:34.910> to<00:03:35.060> one<00:03:35.180> that<00:03:35.300> iced<00:03:35.510> I

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:35.810 
looks very similar to one that iced I

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:39.400 
looks very similar to one that iced I
would<00:03:36.020> line<00:03:36.200> XY<00:03:36.620> then<00:03:36.980> many<00:03:37.670> years<00:03:38.000> ago<00:03:38.180> so<00:03:38.570> how

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
would line XY then many years ago so how

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:40.840 
would line XY then many years ago so how
does<00:03:39.650> the<00:03:39.710> same<00:03:39.890> charge<00:03:40.190> off<00:03:40.370> perhaps<00:03:40.610> there

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
does the same charge off perhaps there

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.650 
does the same charge off perhaps there
something<00:03:41.090> better<00:03:42.020> about<00:03:42.230> the<00:03:42.470> the<00:03:42.920> BC<00:03:43.660> TRW

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:24.030 
directly from USB I don't know if you

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.170 
directly from USB I don't know if you
can<00:05:24.330> shoot<00:05:25.229> at<00:05:25.950> the<00:05:25.979> same<00:05:26.250> time<00:05:26.550> as<00:05:26.700> you<00:05:26.850> can

power<00:05:28.110> off<00:05:28.289> the<00:05:28.320> USB<00:05:28.710> I<00:05:29.070> know<00:05:29.400> Sony<00:05:29.850> do<00:05:29.970> an

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.090 
power off the USB I know Sony do an

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.300 
power off the USB I know Sony do an
external<00:05:30.570> AC<00:05:30.990> adapter<00:05:31.500> that<00:05:31.620> plugs<00:05:31.680> straight

external AC adapter that plugs straight

external AC adapter that plugs straight
into<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.669> battery<00:05:33.000> bay<00:05:33.150> so<00:05:33.870> be<00:05:34.080> interesting

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:34.199 
into the battery bay so be interesting

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:37.219 
into the battery bay so be interesting
to<00:05:34.440> see<00:05:34.560> if<00:05:34.620> you<00:05:34.740> can<00:05:34.889> actually<00:05:35.960> use<00:05:36.960> this

00:05:37.219 --> 00:05:37.229 
to see if you can actually use this

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:38.719 
to see if you can actually use this
while<00:05:37.560> you're<00:05:37.740> shooting<00:05:37.889> I<00:05:38.160> know<00:05:38.490> in<00:05:38.639> the

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:38.729 
while you're shooting I know in the

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:39.890 
while you're shooting I know in the
previous<00:05:38.910> Sony<00:05:39.270> says<00:05:39.510> it<00:05:39.570> was<00:05:39.660> not<00:05:39.870> a

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:39.900 
previous Sony says it was not a

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:43.340 
previous Sony says it was not a
recommended<00:05:41.419> method<00:05:42.419> of<00:05:42.510> operation<00:05:42.960> probably

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:43.350 
recommended method of operation probably

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:44.650 
recommended method of operation probably
because<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.680> USB<00:05:43.979> doesn't<00:05:44.220> provide<00:05:44.430> enough

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:44.660 
because the USB doesn't provide enough

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.360 
because the USB doesn't provide enough
amperage<00:05:45.660> to<00:05:46.289> power<00:05:46.500> the<00:05:46.620> camera<00:05:46.800> wrap<00:05:47.070> while

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:47.370 
amperage to power the camera wrap while

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:50.210 
amperage to power the camera wrap while
it's<00:05:47.550> in<00:05:47.639> operation<00:05:47.849> but<00:05:48.840> we'll<00:05:49.289> see<00:05:49.470> it's<00:05:50.160> a

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 
it's in operation but we'll see it's a

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.409 
it's in operation but we'll see it's a
stand<00:05:50.460> figure<00:05:50.760> eight<00:05:50.880> in<00:05:50.970> one<00:05:51.120> end<00:05:51.300> and

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:51.419 
stand figure eight in one end and

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:54.680 
stand figure eight in one end and
standard<00:05:52.380> USB<00:05:52.590> on<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.889> other<00:05:53.010> end<00:05:53.479> in<00:05:54.479> the<00:05:54.570> app

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:54.690 
standard USB on the other end in the app

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:57.529 
standard USB on the other end in the app
is<00:05:54.870> only<00:05:55.020> only<00:05:55.950> 1500<00:05:56.610> milliamps<00:05:56.910> on<00:05:57.030> this<00:05:57.180> so

00:05:57.529 --> 00:05:57.539 
is only only 1500 milliamps on this so

00:05:57.539 --> 00:06:00.320 
is only only 1500 milliamps on this so
you<00:05:57.900> know<00:05:57.960> 1.5<00:05:58.440> amps<00:05:58.820> doesn't<00:05:59.820> seem<00:05:59.940> a<00:06:00.000> massive

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
you know 1.5 amps doesn't seem a massive

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:01.969 
you know 1.5 amps doesn't seem a massive
amount<00:06:00.570> I'd<00:06:00.750> be<00:06:00.990> very<00:06:01.200> surprised<00:06:01.650> if<00:06:01.770> that's

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:01.979 
amount I'd be very surprised if that's

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:05.210 
amount I'd be very surprised if that's
all<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.220> camera<00:06:02.520> takes<00:06:02.760> when<00:06:03.330> it's<00:06:04.099> well<00:06:05.099> it's

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
all the camera takes when it's well it's

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.770 
all the camera takes when it's well it's
an<00:06:05.340> operation<00:06:05.820> they're<00:06:05.940> expected<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.330> draw

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
an operation they're expected to draw

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.230 
an operation they're expected to draw
more<00:06:06.960> than<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.639> and<00:06:08.639> lastly<00:06:09.210> we<00:06:09.479> have<00:06:09.720> the

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
more than that and lastly we have the

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:15.650 
more than that and lastly we have the
USB<00:06:12.240> cable<00:06:12.860> unfortunately<00:06:13.860> it's<00:06:13.979> a<00:06:14.660> pretty

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:15.660 
USB cable unfortunately it's a pretty

to<00:06:22.050> myself<00:06:22.229> that<00:06:22.620> the<00:06:23.000> provider<00:06:24.000> cable<00:06:24.360> with

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:24.479 
to myself that the provider cable with

to myself that the provider cable with
that<00:06:24.630> is<00:06:24.810> just<00:06:25.169> far<00:06:25.440> too<00:06:25.470> short<00:06:25.860> so<00:06:26.010> it's

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
that is just far too short so it's

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.719 
that is just far too short so it's
useless<00:06:26.430> for<00:06:26.580> tethering<00:06:28.099> one<00:06:29.099> of<00:06:29.220> us<00:06:29.340> you<00:06:29.580> have

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:29.729 
useless for tethering one of us you have

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:31.610 
useless for tethering one of us you have
with<00:06:29.910> the<00:06:29.970> Sony<00:06:30.210> a7<00:06:30.300> range<00:06:30.900> is<00:06:31.080> that<00:06:31.200> it<00:06:31.349> is<00:06:31.500> in

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:31.620 
with the Sony a7 range is that it is in

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:33.770 
with the Sony a7 range is that it is in

so you know it's good that you can get

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.089 
so you know it's good that you can get
an<00:06:36.720> aftermarket<00:06:37.110> cable<00:06:37.530> really<00:06:37.830> easily

an aftermarket cable really easily

00:06:38.099 --> 00:06:40.010 
an aftermarket cable really easily
unlike<00:06:38.610> with<00:06:38.789> the<00:06:38.849> F<00:06:38.970> set<00:06:39.210> 1000<00:06:39.810> where<00:06:39.930> you

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020 
unlike with the F set 1000 where you

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.310 
unlike with the F set 1000 where you

USB cable for it

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:48.710 
USB cable for it
so<00:06:45.540> that's<00:06:45.690> really<00:06:45.930> it<00:06:46.110> for<00:06:46.230> the<00:06:46.320> unboxing<00:06:47.720> now

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:48.720 
so that's really it for the unboxing now

00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.350 
so that's really it for the unboxing now
