get past those walls because without the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.990 
get past those walls because without the
calories<00:02:01.380> in<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.770> soda<00:02:02.009> without<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.729> sugar

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
calories in the soda without that sugar

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.550 
calories in the soda without that sugar
you<00:02:03.270> know<00:02:03.540> I'll<00:02:03.750> be<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.290> little<00:02:04.409> better

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.229 
position to be able to hit new goals and
so<00:02:08.129> I<00:02:08.160> decided<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.550> cut<00:02:08.729> down<00:02:08.849> my<00:02:08.910> sort<00:02:09.179> of

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.040 
consumption from you know I made me have
one<00:02:10.890> let's<00:02:11.280> say<00:02:11.370> two<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.610> day<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.150> and

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
one let's say two a day now and

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.420 
one let's say two a day now and
when<00:02:14.110> I<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.410> sort<00:02:14.650> of<00:02:14.680> maybe<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.920> few<00:02:15.130> times<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
when I have sort of maybe a few times a

when I have sort of maybe a few times a
month<00:02:15.550> maybe<00:02:15.700> once<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.150> week<00:02:16.180> I<00:02:16.570> have<00:02:17.020> some<00:02:17.200> soda

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
month maybe once a week I have some soda

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.370 
month maybe once a week I have some soda
and<00:02:17.800> enjoy<00:02:18.430> it<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:18.790> really<00:02:19.080> have<00:02:20.080> stuff<00:02:20.350> that

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
I really like and just have it when

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.550 
I really like and just have it when
there's<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.600> reason<00:02:22.870> to<00:02:22.900> have<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.260> not<00:02:23.380> just

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
there's a reason to have it not just

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.860 
there's a reason to have it not just
have<00:02:23.740> it<00:02:23.890> because<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.550> another<00:02:24.970> day<00:02:25.300> have<00:02:25.720> it

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
have it because it's another day have it

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.720 
have it because it's another day have it
because<00:02:26.260> I'm<00:02:26.830> celebrating<00:02:27.250> something<00:02:27.430> or

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
because I'm celebrating something or

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.340 
because I'm celebrating something or
because<00:02:28.060> we're<00:02:28.300> going<00:02:28.420> out<00:02:28.600> to<00:02:28.780> eat<00:02:28.810> or<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.140> the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
because we're going out to eat or to the

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:30.600 
because we're going out to eat or to the
movies<00:02:29.500> or<00:02:29.830> something<00:02:30.070> where<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> can<00:02:30.370> just<00:02:30.520> go

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
movies or something where I can just go

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.210 
movies or something where I can just go
ahead<00:02:30.640> and<00:02:30.910> enjoy<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.590> so<00:02:32.590> you<00:02:33.070> know<00:02:33.190> I

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
ahead and enjoy it and so you know I

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.770 
ahead and enjoy it and so you know I
thought<00:02:33.430> about<00:02:33.490> keeping<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.030> show<00:02:34.210> going<00:02:34.510> and

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
thought about keeping the show going and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.060 
thought about keeping the show going and
how<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.990> might<00:02:35.170> impact<00:02:35.470> it<00:02:35.680> I<00:02:35.800> don't<00:02:35.950> you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
how that might impact it I don't you

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.250 
how that might impact it I don't you
know<00:02:36.190> on<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.670> show<00:02:36.700> I<00:02:36.880> drink<00:02:37.270> a<00:02:37.390> not<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> ton<00:02:38.230> of

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
know on the show I drink a not a ton of

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.260 
know on the show I drink a not a ton of
soda<00:02:38.560> but<00:02:38.710> it<00:02:38.920> adds<00:02:39.130> into<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.760> bottom-line

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270 
soda but it adds into the bottom-line

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:42.390 
soda but it adds into the bottom-line
decided<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.260> would<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.590> be<00:02:41.680> easier<00:02:41.920> if

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
decided that it would just be easier if

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.600 
decided that it would just be easier if
I<00:02:43.530> stopped<00:02:44.530> doing<00:02:44.710> the<00:02:44.890> show<00:02:45.040> I<00:02:45.220> thought<00:02:45.400> about

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
I stopped doing the show I thought about

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.040 
I stopped doing the show I thought about
different<00:02:46.000> concepts<00:02:46.420> for<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.600> show<00:02:46.750> moving

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
different concepts for the show moving

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.270 
different concepts for the show moving
forward<00:02:47.290> I<00:02:47.350> thought<00:02:47.500> about<00:02:47.620> cutting<00:02:47.860> down<00:02:48.100> to

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
forward I thought about cutting down to

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.620 
forward I thought about cutting down to
three<00:02:48.490> days<00:02:48.610> a<00:02:48.640> week<00:02:48.760> two<00:02:49.030> days<00:02:49.060> a<00:02:49.210> week<00:02:49.330> one

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
three days a week two days a week one

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.570 
three days a week two days a week one
day<00:02:49.690> a<00:02:49.840> week<00:02:50.050> doing<00:02:50.440> other<00:02:50.770> concept<00:02:51.400> shows

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:51.580 
day a week doing other concept shows

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.980 
day a week doing other concept shows
where<00:02:51.760> I<00:02:51.820> didn't<00:02:51.970> have<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.240> do<00:02:52.330> soda<00:02:52.600> but<00:02:52.840> I

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
where I didn't have to do soda but I

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.260 
where I didn't have to do soda but I
decided<00:02:53.500> if<00:02:53.710> I<00:02:53.800> couldn't<00:02:53.830> go<00:02:54.190> full-on<00:02:54.760> with<00:02:55.180> it

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:55.270 
decided if I couldn't go full-on with it

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:57.150 
decided if I couldn't go full-on with it
like<00:02:55.390> I<00:02:55.480> do<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:55.780> five<00:02:56.020> days<00:02:56.230> a<00:02:56.260> week<00:02:56.350> I<00:02:56.650> just

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
like I do now five days a week I just

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.890 
like I do now five days a week I just
didn't<00:02:57.310> want<00:02:57.460> to<00:02:57.490> continue<00:02:58.030> it<00:02:58.150> in<00:02:58.330> a<00:02:58.570> reduced

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
didn't want to continue it in a reduced

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.280 
didn't want to continue it in a reduced
form<00:02:59.170> so<00:02:59.910> that's<00:03:00.910> kind<00:03:01.480> of<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.630> main<00:03:01.840> reason

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
form so that's kind of the main reason

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.680 
form so that's kind of the main reason
they<00:03:02.410> are<00:03:02.610> nestled<00:03:03.610> I'm<00:03:03.700> going<00:03:03.820> to<00:03:04.180> drink<00:03:04.390> soda
