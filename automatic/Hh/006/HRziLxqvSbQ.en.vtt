00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.969
 of 14 years old my birthday is 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.550
 Approaching February 13 I have a dream 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.200
 and is to know that is the dream of 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:24.260
 Pauline meet Carlos Arias Morales 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.410
 52 of the 80's america meet their 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.410
 dreams 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.109
 we are grateful to America but 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:35.649
 right now we do not have very feelings 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:38.000
 found we want to win we want that 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.170
 morelia sume de a tres 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.870
 I feel like a soccer player 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.609
 master I was born a soccer player and I'm going to 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.010
 to die soccer player that I'm sure 

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.499
 that I would love to be inside the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.789
 court as a player no longer gives me the age 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:52.270
 they do not give me my legs either 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.890
 they give the operations that I have 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.330
 I am the happiest person in the world 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.330
 find a soccer field 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.469
 like us 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.830
 3 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.180
 this is the model you want to have with 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.180
 intense fury 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.530
 and if it is transmitted to pikolin 

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.840
 this new one suffers and is born in the 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.840
 final moments 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:55.240
 the packaging of the budgeted with penalty 

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:56.730
 but I know that I noticed their kind of dreams and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.540
 they will wait 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.870
 but hers Paul's was made 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.870
 reality 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.689
 do not 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.920
 it's not for me 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.920
 with ideas 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:27.230
 this knows 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.100
 interest to the team because the rest 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.950
 people do not like the wind 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.340
 I went through it while cooking until 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.340
 shapes
