and I have to see luck was on my side so

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.150 
and I have to see luck was on my side so
I<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.450> that<00:01:39.750> for<00:01:39.960> her<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.950> they<00:01:41.010> should

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
I think that for her and they should

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:43.850 
I think that for her and they should
play<00:01:41.280> correctly<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.030> but<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> one<00:01:43.530> hand

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
play correctly but but that one hand

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.920 
play correctly but but that one hand
gave<00:01:44.490> me<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.640> lot<00:01:44.820> of<00:01:44.970> talent<00:01:45.330> that's<00:01:45.600> very

gave me a lot of talent that's very
compassionate<00:01:46.290> perspective<00:01:47.220> I<00:01:47.670> think<00:01:47.850> it's

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
compassionate perspective I think it's

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.390
