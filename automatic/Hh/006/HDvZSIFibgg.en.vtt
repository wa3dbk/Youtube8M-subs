 myself I will offer you even number of judgments on the background the beautiful 

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:09.459
 and there is the judge Helen targeted and for good reason they are filled 

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:12.459
 it is better not to be afraid 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.659
 the right answer if you have to remember 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.289
 the family of the minor will be renewed in E minor 

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:27.949
 the world 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.919
 in the museums night the vintage 2 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.600
 we do not want or even we are legion of honor to the real 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.530
 basically it must already have 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.890
 led this is the name of the modes of the hour agreement 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.890
 kyle downes men are 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.280
 floor 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.500
 the uci 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.500
 so of course there are notions of comfort everyone 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.180
 at midday 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.160
 gold often there is and he is rather happy 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160
 here i'm going to run a little bit matter month 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.780
 djeneba out of ignorance but good why not take notice of 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.950
 damages 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.260
 not at all 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.880
 first know employees 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.270
 it is composed of an agreement on October 9, 2009 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.070
 from where a blouse 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.900
 I want to play in major but often they put their departure but on an agreement 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.170
 major it's been ten years since that's how we do too many better days 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.080
 so here's this impending agreement 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 - it's a deadweight effect 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:38.450
 I also explain to you that we will therefore the names of 2009 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.860
 it is indeed an emphasis 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.690
 it's simon n 12 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:50.110
 because I'm going from 4 pm 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.640
 it's gilles simon 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:53.679
 jcs 

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.290
 it was so 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.290
 this is the case in other areas 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.360
 Boumelha 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.360
 thought from midday dakhla 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.579
 to arrive 

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:14.969
 in his purse 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.969
 so of course that requires the experience of some ears 

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:24.689
 so why 

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.399
 we can have the budget have to help 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:29.119
 roger sector attached to it 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.119
 mt great 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:41.079
 one year before 

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:49.849
 in the decisive game as it happened 

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:51.709
 it still seems like it's 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.890
 these are things that are 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.270
 they are supported that we say to ourselves the difficult things 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.549
 to order I will 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.549
 In order to climb 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:07.229
 two straight strokes right 

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:08.809
 eventually 

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:11.709
 because at a warm and french bourgoin moment 

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:14.709
 it hurts face to face marseille it's difficult 

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:21.039
 the results 

00:03:21.039 --> 00:03:23.609
 on this point 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.909
 while he was a minor 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:30.370
 so I did even we can already start with those concluded we start from the 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.039
 meuse 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:32.869
 kelly we have a mind 

00:03:32.869 --> 00:03:35.869
 we accomplished by poland 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:51.189
 bet on sarajevo m normally disagree 7 

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:57.119
 he told me that the agreement is major 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:04:01.009
 benjamin conz level of the best 

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:16.849
 we come back from afar 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:27.189
 3 erdogan 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:34.149
