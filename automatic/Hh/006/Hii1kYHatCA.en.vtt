00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
look out for that and subscribe to my

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.360 
look out for that and subscribe to my
channel<00:03:45.840> but<00:03:46.590> the<00:03:46.680> video<00:03:46.920> hasn't<00:03:47.099> finished

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
channel but the video hasn't finished

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:50.020 
channel but the video hasn't finished
yet<00:03:47.580> what<00:03:48.209> am<00:03:48.299> I<00:03:48.390> saying<00:03:48.569> that<00:03:48.780> anyway<00:03:49.650> we<00:03:49.769> have

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
yet what am I saying that anyway we have

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.690 
yet what am I saying that anyway we have
this<00:03:51.030> as<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.450> more<00:03:51.599> prominent<00:03:51.840> roof<00:03:52.700> curving

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
this as the more prominent roof curving

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.250 
this as the more prominent roof curving
that<00:03:53.849> way<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> then<00:03:54.390> we<00:03:54.510> have<00:03:54.659> the<00:03:54.780> secondary

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
that way and then we have the secondary

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.369 
that way and then we have the secondary
roof<00:03:55.500> here<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.400> give<00:03:56.519> it<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.670> bit<00:03:56.819> more<00:03:56.849> feel<00:03:57.379> the

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
roof here to give it a bit more feel the

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:00.500 
roof here to give it a bit more feel the
it's<00:03:59.340> going<00:03:59.549> to<00:03:59.610> go<00:03:59.700> too<00:03:59.760> high<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.209> it's<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.360> more

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
it's going to go too high so it's a more

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.050 
it's going to go too high so it's a more
steeper<00:04:00.989> roof<00:04:01.170> than<00:04:01.379> usual<00:04:01.769> it's<00:04:02.040> a<00:04:02.459> I<00:04:02.730> just

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
steeper roof than usual it's a I just

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.259 
steeper roof than usual it's a I just
made<00:04:03.209> this<00:04:03.360> design<00:04:03.750> anyway<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:05.489> roof<00:04:05.760> the

00:04:06.259 --> 00:04:06.269 
made this design anyway the roof the

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:09.830 
made this design anyway the roof the
sorry<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:08.000> the<00:04:09.000> windows<00:04:09.329> are<00:04:09.480> going<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.690> pop

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:09.840 
sorry the the windows are going to pop

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:11.899 
sorry the the windows are going to pop
out<00:04:10.019> one<00:04:10.530> block<00:04:10.739> so<00:04:11.370> I'm<00:04:11.489> not<00:04:11.610> going<00:04:11.730> to<00:04:11.790> be

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:11.909 
out one block so I'm not going to be

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:13.039 
out one block so I'm not going to be
flush<00:04:12.180> with<00:04:12.209> the<00:04:12.390> wall<00:04:12.540> they're<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:12.989> to

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
flush with the wall they're going to

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.140 
flush with the wall they're going to
come<00:04:13.230> out<00:04:13.260> then<00:04:14.069> you<00:04:14.160> put<00:04:14.340> this<00:04:14.430> design<00:04:14.640> I<00:04:14.879> just

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
come out then you put this design I just

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.909 
come out then you put this design I just
came<00:04:15.329> up<00:04:15.480> with<00:04:15.660> with<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:15.989> new<00:04:16.229> ability<00:04:16.799> to

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
came up with with the new ability to

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:20.000 
came up with with the new ability to
place<00:04:17.130> the<00:04:17.400> logs<00:04:17.729> like<00:04:17.850> that<00:04:17.910> as<00:04:18.289> well<00:04:19.289> as<00:04:19.769> do

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
place the logs like that as well as do

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.540 
place the logs like that as well as do
the<00:04:20.489> end<00:04:20.729> piece<00:04:21.060> with<00:04:21.630> the<00:04:21.660> would<00:04:21.900> like<00:04:22.049> that

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:22.550 
the end piece with the would like that

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:26.420 
the end piece with the would like that
so<00:04:23.550> it's<00:04:23.880> quite<00:04:24.270> a<00:04:24.330> complex<00:04:24.960> build<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.530> theory

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
so it's quite a complex build in theory

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.820 
so it's quite a complex build in theory
although<00:04:26.669> it<00:04:27.449> isn't<00:04:27.600> as<00:04:27.870> complex<00:04:28.380> as<00:04:28.650> some

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
although it isn't as complex as some

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.590 
although it isn't as complex as some
other<00:04:28.979> builds<00:04:29.990> and<00:04:31.340> then<00:04:32.340> this<00:04:33.000> place<00:04:33.270> over

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
other builds and then this place over

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.240 
other builds and then this place over
here<00:04:33.840> quickly<00:04:34.110> as<00:04:34.380> the<00:04:34.500> finished<00:04:34.830> video<00:04:34.919> off
