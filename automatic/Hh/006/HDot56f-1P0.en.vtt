00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
how do you connect it to the line when I

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.740 
how do you connect it to the line when I
do<00:01:19.190> I<00:01:19.250> take<00:01:19.520> the<00:01:19.640> balloon<00:01:19.790> tied<00:01:20.240> in<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:20.479> knot<00:01:20.509> and

do I take the balloon tied in a knot and
then<00:01:21.200> I'll<00:01:21.320> just<00:01:21.350> tie<00:01:21.679> another<00:01:22.160> knot<00:01:22.310> right

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:22.789 
then I'll just tie another knot right

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:24.850 
then I'll just tie another knot right
around<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:23.240> line<00:01:23.840> just<00:01:24.050> like<00:01:24.140> that<00:01:24.470> and<00:01:24.740> it

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
around the line just like that and it

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.139 
around the line just like that and it
breaks<00:01:25.070> loose<00:01:25.340> when<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.610> get<00:01:25.729> the<00:01:25.820> fish<00:01:25.970> on

when<00:01:53.720> we<00:01:53.780> first<00:01:53.960> caught<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> bait<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:55.369> now<00:01:55.490> we

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
when we first caught the bait and now we

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:56.920 
when we first caught the bait and now we
got<00:01:55.729> two<00:01:55.909> on<00:01:56.060> I<00:01:56.240> imagine<00:01:56.570> we'll<00:01:56.659> get<00:01:56.810> them
