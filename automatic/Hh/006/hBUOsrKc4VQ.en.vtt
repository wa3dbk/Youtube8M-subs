00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:34.789 
car running for Dale as soon as possible

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:37.059 
car running for Dale as soon as possible
the<00:01:35.749> outside<00:01:36.079> shape<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.799> car<00:01:36.950> is

00:01:37.059 --> 00:01:37.069 
the outside shape of the car is

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.520 
the outside shape of the car is
fundamentally<00:01:37.579> done<00:01:38.149> now<00:01:38.569> so<00:01:39.049> we've<00:01:39.289> got

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
fundamentally done now so we've got

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.230 
fundamentally done now so we've got
front<00:01:39.920> we've<00:01:40.130> got<00:01:40.310> a<00:01:40.340> rear<00:01:40.609> we've<00:01:40.909> got<00:01:41.119> the

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
front we've got a rear we've got the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.419 
front we've got a rear we've got the
modified<00:01:41.659> panels<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:42.380> go<00:01:42.799> for<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.189> doors

00:01:43.419 --> 00:01:43.429 
modified panels that go for the doors

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:46.480 
modified panels that go for the doors
and<00:01:44.030> it<00:01:44.210> looks<00:01:44.450> like<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:45.319> gunmetal<00:01:45.859> color<00:01:46.189> is

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:46.490 
and it looks like the gunmetal color is

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.120 
and it looks like the gunmetal color is
the<00:01:47.420> one<00:01:47.600> that<00:01:47.840> will<00:01:48.079> be<00:01:48.409> the<00:01:48.499> base<00:01:48.619> color<00:01:48.859> for

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
the one that will be the base color for

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.160 
the one that will be the base color for
the<00:01:49.189> car<00:01:49.369> and<00:01:49.579> then<00:01:50.270> we've<00:01:50.509> been<00:01:50.689> looking<00:01:51.049> at

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
the car and then we've been looking at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.330 
the car and then we've been looking at
how<00:01:51.409> will<00:01:51.710> do<00:01:52.249> what<00:01:53.030> isn't<00:01:53.389> slavishly<00:01:54.139> a<00:01:54.350> union

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
how will do what isn't slavishly a union

he's<00:03:11.810> got<00:03:11.959> away<00:03:12.200> from<00:03:12.439> that<00:03:12.590> now<00:03:12.799> and<00:03:12.950> we

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
he's got away from that now and we

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.649 
he's got away from that now and we
probably<00:03:13.220> won't<00:03:13.430> have<00:03:13.609> benefit<00:03:14.269> the<00:03:14.480> bait

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:14.659

stage<00:03:15.079> I'm<00:03:15.260> at<00:03:15.409> right<00:03:15.590> now<00:03:15.909> is<00:03:16.909> to<00:03:16.970> device<00:03:17.959> what

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:18.319 
stage I'm at right now is to device what

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:21.369 
stage I'm at right now is to device what
that<00:03:18.590> top<00:03:19.040> piece<00:03:19.250> will<00:03:19.489> be<00:03:19.639> like<00:03:19.849> because<00:03:20.379> what

00:03:21.369 --> 00:03:21.379 
that top piece will be like because what

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:22.809 
that top piece will be like because what
it<00:03:21.500> doesn't<00:03:21.859> want<00:03:21.980> to<00:03:22.099> do<00:03:22.219> is<00:03:22.370> look<00:03:22.579> like<00:03:22.790> a

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:22.819 
it doesn't want to do is look like a
