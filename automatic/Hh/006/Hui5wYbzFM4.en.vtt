 to be here with you in this video 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.450
 I know it's something a little different but 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.830
 I really want to share everything 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.250
 what am I doing for my baby 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.110
 valentina with a lot of love according to the 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.029
 school of some age position make a 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.550
 gift or if you want to make them 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.310
 just for his daughters' room 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.320
 of his nieces or some king who goes 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.420
 to reach the family if you want 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.339
 make these ornaments for any baby 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.260
 that is male you just have to 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.960
 change the colors to all the slats 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.940
 and I as a video script we are going to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.890
 make a centerpiece or an ornament 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.229
 lovely owl 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.229
 so we 're going to see how it's done 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.870
 we need a pot and paint for 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.750
 paint the chocolate or black color 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.850
 with a ball of unicel of the good size 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.829
 will depend on your pot you have to 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.610
 put it was going to stay half of 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.610
 the pot an oasis box 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:16.869
 a wooden stick about 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.869
 about 30 centimeters 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:24.960
 silicone and silicone gun 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:29.240
 2 meters from the moment it's like with 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.240
 olanchito and an ornament owl 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.030
 you need five different slats 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.410
 the colors that you want 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.520
 approximately two meters of each 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:44.640
 strip and you will cut them into strips 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.040
 about 12 centimeters the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.400
 five different slats cut in 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.400
 strips 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.229
 The first thing you're going to do is wrap 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.090
 your wooden stick very well with ribbon 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.500
 and my gun was broken 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.140
 silicon why I'm doing this 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.240
 mexicanada but we have to paste all 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.400
 our slats and fold them towards the 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.790
 half and paste it very well as you go 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.790
 to see next 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:16.510
 and so you must paste all the cuts 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.510
 of the ribbon 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.790
 also the ribbon that goes rolled in the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.000
 stick has to be very well stuck and 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.800
 now we're going to start putting this 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.800
 stick with the ball of unicel 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.470
 with a little silicon to one of your 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.570
 already folded ribbons and we're going to 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:41.990
 start hitting the ball like this 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.730
 successively all our cock of 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.890
 strips with silicon on the ball as per 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.370
 a thousand hours until you are staying 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 something like that 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:58.109
 and this is barely half so when 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.150
 you have half ready turn the ball and 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.459
 You start doing the above 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.930
 another side until everything is all all 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:08.439
 full of ribbons 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.069
 and the truth is if you are going to take a long time 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:15.640
 but enjoy it relax relax remember 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:18.219
 to be beautiful and one day will be 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.950
 ready so now that you have your little tree 

00:03:18.219 --> 00:03:23.560
 now we go with the pot we are going to paste 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.689
 the ribbon of olanchito 2 for everything 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.480
 around the pot as you are 

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:32.640
 seeing I stuck it with this resistor 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:34.770
 gummy but you can be with silicone 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.670
 but I feel that silicon does not stick very 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:41.310
 well in the good pot after you put a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.640
 little bit of oasis inside your pot 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:47.490
 to be able to put our 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 little tree has already finished this way 

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:52.440
 way in the center he has put paper 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.890
 from china green but I did not love what 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:59.690
 fill in with this and it stayed like this 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.630
 I hope you have loved this video 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:04.250
