the Harbour Bridge as well so it is a

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.120 
the Harbour Bridge as well so it is a

the<00:01:41.130> flag<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.640> think<00:01:42.329> there<00:01:42.780> is<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:42.930> there's<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
the flag I think there is a there's a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.560 
the flag I think there is a there's a
lot<00:01:43.920> of<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.310> know<00:01:44.340> misconceptions<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.360> lot<00:01:45.479> of

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
because for me the Tino rangatiratanga

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.080 
because for me the Tino rangatiratanga
flag<00:01:51.570> is<00:01:52.170> as<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.649> positive<00:01:52.950> thing<00:01:53.430> it

i<00:02:05.340> think<00:02:05.430> is<00:02:05.579> you<00:02:05.790> know<00:02:05.820> even<00:02:06.149> more<00:02:06.240> relevant

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
i think is you know even more relevant

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.850 
i think is you know even more relevant
these<00:02:06.810> days<00:02:07.079> if<00:02:07.259> you're<00:02:07.380> looking<00:02:07.619> at<00:02:07.740> issues

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
these days if you're looking at issues

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.109 
these days if you're looking at issues
of<00:02:08.069> like<00:02:08.340> global<00:02:08.700> warming<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.060> climate

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
of like global warming and climate

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.860 
of like global warming and climate
change<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.720> those<00:02:09.810> sorts<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> things<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:11.099> I

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
change and those sorts of things so I

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.610 
change and those sorts of things so I
guess<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:13.020> real<00:02:13.200> question

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
guess the real question

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.680 
guess the real question
how<00:02:13.950> do<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.220> you<00:02:14.580> know<00:02:14.640> above<00:02:14.909> and<00:02:15.090> beyond<00:02:15.390> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
how do you you know above and beyond you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.449 
how do you you know above and beyond you
know<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.959> but<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:16.379> suppose<00:02:16.709> that<00:02:16.739> people<00:02:17.340> do

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:17.459 
know this but I suppose that people do

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.160 
know this but I suppose that people do
feel<00:02:17.670> threatened<00:02:18.090> by<00:02:18.209> it<00:02:18.269> because<00:02:18.720> maybe

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
feel threatened by it because maybe

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.600 
feel threatened by it because maybe
because<00:02:19.650> they<00:02:19.830> don't<00:02:19.860> understand<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.519> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
because they don't understand what it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.250 
because they don't understand what it

many different expressions there are

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.069 
many different expressions there are
many<00:03:44.609> examples<00:03:44.730> all<00:03:45.269> around<00:03:45.510> the<00:03:45.599> world<00:03:45.810> of

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
I think certainly certain six a certain

section<00:05:39.620> of<00:05:39.800> New<00:05:40.520> Zealand<00:05:40.909> is<00:05:41.090> coming

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
section of New Zealand is coming

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.270 
section of New Zealand is coming
together<00:05:41.659> there's<00:05:42.409> still<00:05:42.650> that<00:05:42.800> slice<00:05:43.099> of

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:43.280 
together there's still that slice of

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:45.189 
together there's still that slice of
used<00:05:43.490> under<00:05:43.699> which<00:05:43.849> I<00:05:44.030> think<00:05:44.360> is<00:05:44.900> largely

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:45.199 
used under which I think is largely

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.709 
used under which I think is largely
uninformed<00:05:46.070> and<00:05:46.219> needs<00:05:46.789> to<00:05:46.909> actually<00:05:47.330> get<00:05:47.630> up

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:47.719 
uninformed and needs to actually get up

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.570 
uninformed and needs to actually get up
to<00:05:47.750> the<00:05:47.930> play<00:05:48.139> for<00:05:48.710> example<00:05:48.800> if<00:05:49.280> you<00:05:49.400> and<00:05:49.550> I

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:49.580 
to the play for example if you and I

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.980 
to the play for example if you and I
were<00:05:49.729> going<00:05:49.820> to<00:05:49.880> talk<00:05:50.060> about<00:05:50.120> algebra<00:05:50.630> and<00:05:50.960> you

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:50.990 
were going to talk about algebra and you

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.589 
were going to talk about algebra and you
can't<00:05:51.710> add<00:05:51.919> then<00:05:52.580> our<00:05:52.909> conversation<00:05:53.449> is<00:05:53.509> not

00:05:53.589 --> 00:05:53.599 
can't add then our conversation is not

00:05:53.599 --> 00:05:55.270 
can't add then our conversation is not
going<00:05:53.780> to<00:05:53.840> go<00:05:53.930> very<00:05:53.960> far<00:05:54.380> and<00:05:54.530> that's<00:05:54.979> I<00:05:55.219> think

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:55.280 
going to go very far and that's I think

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.520 
going to go very far and that's I think
where<00:05:55.909> one<00:05:56.120> of<00:05:56.150> the<00:05:56.300> problems<00:05:56.630> are<00:05:56.810> is<00:05:57.169> a<00:05:57.229> lack

where one of the problems are is a lack
of<00:05:57.560> information<00:05:57.889> and<00:05:58.370> there's<00:05:58.940> a<00:05:59.030> local<00:05:59.210> and

00:06:00.899 --> 00:06:00.909 
because of that there's a lack of

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:04.209 
because of that there's a lack of
analysis<00:06:01.909> on<00:06:02.120> a<00:06:02.440> lot<00:06:03.440> of<00:06:03.469> these<00:06:03.620> issues<00:06:03.800> right
