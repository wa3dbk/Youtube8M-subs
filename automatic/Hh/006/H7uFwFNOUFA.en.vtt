00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
so you might say a sponge I thought

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.240

we're supposed to buy brushes there's a
time<00:02:23.520> and<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.730> place<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:23.940> every<00:02:24.450> tool<00:02:24.660> but<00:02:25.230> this

time and a place for every tool but this

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.520 
time and a place for every tool but this
I<00:02:25.710> found<00:02:26.420> especially<00:02:27.420> watching<00:02:28.140> them<00:02:28.260> work

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
I found especially watching them work

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.850 
I found especially watching them work
really<00:02:29.030> helped<00:02:30.030> make<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.600> appear<00:02:31.260> more<00:02:31.620> like<00:02:31.830> a

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
really helped make it appear more like a

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.650 
really helped make it appear more like a
hand<00:02:32.250> has<00:02:32.460> been<00:02:32.700> there<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.450> thing<00:02:33.600> about

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
hand has been there so the thing about

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.390 
hand has been there so the thing about
fun<00:02:33.960> is<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.200> it's<00:02:34.320> kind<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.560> squishy<00:02:34.800> right

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
fun is that it's kind of squishy right

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.790 
fun is that it's kind of squishy right
so<00:02:35.580> if<00:02:35.760> you<00:02:35.880> put<00:02:36.090> it<00:02:36.180> on<00:02:36.300> your<00:02:36.450> face<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.930> not

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
so if you put it on your face it not

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:39.560 
so if you put it on your face it not
only<00:02:38.010> does<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.250> absorb<00:02:38.580> product<00:02:38.850> but<00:02:39.330> it<00:02:39.420> also

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
only does it absorb product but it also

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.930 
only does it absorb product but it also
picks<00:02:39.960> up<00:02:40.140> and<00:02:40.350> places<00:02:40.980> product<00:02:41.340> picks<00:02:41.550> up<00:02:41.700> and

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
picks up and places product picks up and

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.310 
picks up and places product picks up and
places<00:02:42.240> products<00:02:42.600> and<00:02:42.720> it<00:02:42.840> really<00:02:43.020> makes<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320

movement with my product and I really

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.370 
movement with my product and I really
feel<00:02:47.970> like<00:02:48.090> it's<00:02:48.210> kind<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> sinking<00:02:49.200> it<00:02:49.350> into

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
feel like it's kind of sinking it into

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.170 
feel like it's kind of sinking it into
the<00:02:49.800> skin<00:02:50.040> as<00:02:50.310> opposed<00:02:50.640> to<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.820> brush<00:02:51.030> which

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
the skin as opposed to a brush which

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.820 
the skin as opposed to a brush which
kind<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.570> dusts<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.020> onto<00:02:52.320> your<00:02:52.410> face<00:02:52.470> and

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830

you<00:02:52.890> just<00:02:52.920> kind<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.280> wait<00:02:53.790> for<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:54.240> absorb

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
you just kind of wait for it to absorb

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.810
