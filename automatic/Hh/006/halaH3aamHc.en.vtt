 seems new to player my channel and like 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.990
 jamie 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.580
 I am in the planning right now 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.529
 come call or duty ghosts if you yourself 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.790
 can of course also see and play 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.830
 especially fly on the moss 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.360
 swimmer playing with everything I thought 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.430
 you know i live work with the farmers 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.259
 go players cam turned on and used 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.939
 says come oh shit i use the set 

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.169
 Could Sentry Gun and Village Paddle 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:30.489
 hain't 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.770
 and we have to pay attention because it 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:33.940
 is a play game and what about me? 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.860
 don't touch 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.149
 oh my god that guy bad i already shot 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.470
 if just had looked at the minimap on 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:39.940
 its just pay attention and did you know that I 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.890
 my problem was not behind him 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.790
 of course but to have a nice span when 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.830
 me twice in succession 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.050
 I'll already put him in the set 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.640
 just in the middle of the magnet 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.140
 and then we have another on the right to 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.030
 have to make 4 kills are pretty 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.920
 so not a very big comeback 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.660
 but of course a comeback to good 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.310
 keep an eye on hours or four thieves 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.050

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.880

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.200
 three force each other the same person 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.839
 I think that is doing well than you on 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.829
 oh pity friend who is bending weak 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.329

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:08.770
 Always course will these tricks and I 

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:10.360
 loved a kill floating a game 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.159
 probably all that at next week or 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.009

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:54.820
 not now with a big demand 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.080
 is where i was from 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 probably for the 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.080
 people who do not know the beads quite 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:00.910
 very chill weapon to use 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.530

 I'll take a shot I 'll branch 12 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.050
 Genetically I think that's what you do 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.850
 to use but it's fun with the 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.010
 bullock is that natural whole 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.950
 the water automatically pours whoever goes 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.110
 just really like a pure fruit and yep there 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.760
 9 chose and sit with xmx instead of 6 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.750
 so there can just be spray as one 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.040
