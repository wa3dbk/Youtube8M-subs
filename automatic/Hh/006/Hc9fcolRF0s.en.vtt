00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.570
 humpback 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.220
 that with the pensiones that's one of those 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.660
 thing I train in the 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:35.400
 since 14 yes my father had or mine 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.800
 father is shepherd was from one of 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.630
 overcome a sports facility there is a 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.470
 power room that is not a gym 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.920
 it's a proper force force room with so 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.510
 I have some old equipment underneath 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.860
 I started to train 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.900
 I once made fun in the 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.050
 to train for weeks 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:57.030
 in addition to the football I have been for a long time 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.390
 time keeper and there really 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.150
 ambitions in professional football to gain a foothold 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.619
 but with the age I noticed that 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.240
 I'm not getting bigger anymore 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.970
 now 177 tall probably many know well 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:15.120
 I am tall and as a goalkeeper I was 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.620
 Goalkeeper, it is very very small and 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.510
 I realized that I no longer 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.750
 get ahead 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.790
 as the maximum first league in switzerland 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.190
 first league that is in germany it is 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:29.440
 that there is no idea 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:32.950
 absolutely anti football here at the start 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.760
 is under the second bundesliga and 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.930
 I realized that will just come in 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.380
 footballer nothing and then I have 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.400
 I continue to focus on weight training 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.950
 I'm starting 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:50.650
 here was lotina weight training is not 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:52.960
 cheap since well exactly yes 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.730
 a year almost yes I come 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.560
 originally from the weight training I have 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.780
 I always trained without a system 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.860
 ate a long time what I wanted chips 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.420
 chocolate bar I have everything in it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.980
 stuck i have not got up at all 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.480
 the closer you got me 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.460
 this topic is not dealt with yes 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.520
 because I simply went in Staten 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.470
 because because i use this energy i am here 

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.880
 Every now and then I always have to get out 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.850
 leave and then I have fast 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 noticed that one with with the 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.890
 bodybuilding natural bodybuilding 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:27.880
 fitness with training his mind yes 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.530
 be his body and soul yes 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.360
 can learn to control 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:35.770
 For me, the sport of fitness is one 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.120
 instrument around your body your mind and 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.830
 to control your soul 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.700
 and I will make you something easy 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.520
 my friends out there 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:46.209
 in my opinion yes of mine 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.209
 still opinion 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:54.840
 if you own your own body 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.629
 his spirit has your soul under control 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.720
 You can control that perfectly even in 

00:03:57.629 --> 00:04:02.159
 the situation is then feelings too 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.799
 that means if it's here 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.870
 bad actually somehow goes one 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.470
 find solution instrument that is the 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.690
 good again if you can do that then 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.040
 you are your own lord and master and 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.519
 if you your own men's champion to 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.199
 when and when do you have exactly what have you got 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.880
 That's what it's about to do that 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:24.050
 only at the bodybuilding come that 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:31.470
 is first why should yes 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:32.400
 at the bodybuilding behind the natural 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.830
 body building 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:38.160
 it is very important that makes him 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.910
 around and in my opinion I have to 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.780
 Again always say my opinion 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:48.510
 the nutrition is very much related to 

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:51.030
 the spirit as you feel you 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.430
 called is how you can think me 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.789
 I noticed that my comprehension 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.190
 has changed so improved 

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:00.870
 had been through the healthy diet 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.990
 that actually trust or have noticed 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:07.330
 what can be achieved with this sport 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.540
 I mean, there are others again 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:12.220
 Topics like organization discipline 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.880
 effectiveness efficiency all such 

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:18.850
 I will tell you in the videos 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.360
 explain one to one and there could be 

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:24.810
 I can be curious there 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.810
 expect 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:34.570
 There you can be prepared for a lot 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:37.510
 expect a lot and keep going 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.030
 yes she already heard a lot here 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.990
 Regarding sports on me now one more 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.280
 I would not care 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:44.380
 Personally, I'll talk about the topic 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.270
 as he even never talked but in 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.800
 you think this is pure from now on 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:49.420
 optical appearance you have yourself 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:52.150
 yes radically changed as I said you are 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:53.920
 Building with nutrition makes everything pure 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.360
 from the performance you think you know 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:57.520
 You have been training this for 13 years 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:59.530
 You can see it even if I am now 

00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:01.810
 Honestly, I really do have one 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.420
 huge measure of me but the contracts has 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:07.240
 Simply quality in the muscles or how 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.980
 the german railway quality of her 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.600
 quality and you think you think that 

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:15.950
 do you think the bodybuilding training 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.960
 that you have changed now 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:19.300
 that's another leap forward 

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.050
 has brought or do you think that 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.480
 theoretically if you have the diet 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.100
 Optimize that he would be one with the 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:27.890
 weight training as well as the full power 

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:29.690
 hast that is undisciplined workout 

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:31.370
 but just hard do you think that is 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:33.710
 alone would be enough for optimal 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.600
 Achieving results is very much 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:37.640
 good question 

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.020
 no it takes the combination i am 

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:42.620
 the opinion would need it 

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:44.090
 combination between everything in all 

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:46.280
 areas also the first line that 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.200
 Know-how system with stage technology 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:50.240
 but also the know how for the 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.920
 nutrition you have to know your limits 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.390
 learning must learn how to do that 

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:56.360
 border crack yes how to get it right 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:59.600
 crackles and with this whole 

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.610
 combinations only that makes it then the 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.840
 Difference if you are in natural 

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:07.940
 bodybuilding is simply good or you 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.650
 goddamn is top 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:10.940
 that's the difference in performance 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.830
 This is really the player 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.870
 difference have so last 

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:18.590
 process a bit really right 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:20.630
 if they now there sorrow in the in the in 

00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:23.380
 the active fund goes on the stage yes 

00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:24.910
 Speaking of competitions ago 

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.500
 if you just want to have good ball 

00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:29.770
 that's different when it's good 

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:31.060
 have good sixpack good muscles 

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.950
 I'll build something else again 

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.250
 really speak from the top now 

00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:37.950
 level optimal maximum devices completely 

00:07:36.250 --> 00:07:45.460
 exactly 

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:47.920
 ok and maybe it is 

00:07:45.460 --> 00:07:50.400
 not in front of camera remain more serious 

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.400
 dealer
