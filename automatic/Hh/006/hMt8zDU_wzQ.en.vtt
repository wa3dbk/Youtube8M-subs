00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.200
Hello!
In this new immunopill

00:00:12.274 --> 00:00:15.020
we are going to continue 
with the lymphocyte subpopulations.

00:00:15.177 --> 00:00:18.205
As I have explained before, 
they are going to serve as a reference

00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:20.670
before studying
 the antigen receptor of the T lymphocyte.

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.900
In this pill, we are paying attention
to the main subpopulation,

00:00:24.022 --> 00:00:28.170
the most evolved T lymphocytes: 
the alpha beta T lymphocytes.

00:00:28.742 --> 00:00:33.170
We have this situation: we have already studied
the gamma delta lymphocytes; they are a minority;

00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:37.720
they are called T1 by some authors
and have specific functions

00:00:38.228 --> 00:00:41.670
because they include delta 1 and delta 2 chains;
I remind you they fight against tumors.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.620
And they also have the CD8 co-receptor,
which is the alpha alpha co-receptor.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.220
What happens with the alpha beta cells?

00:00:49.531 --> 00:00:53.920
From the point of view of their activity
we normally call them

00:00:54.057 --> 00:00:56.800
cooperative and cytotoxic,
and approximately

00:00:56.891 --> 00:00:59.050
all the proportions we can see here
are right.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.537
About 60% of our alpha beta cells 
in blood are cooperative

00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:07.050
and about 40% are cytotoxic.

00:01:07.222 --> 00:01:14.300
In fact, these names are incomplete, 
porque, as we will see in this immunopill,

00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:17.020
apart from the cooperative function
there are some other functions

00:01:17.154 --> 00:01:20.300
inside the cells expressing
CD4 proteins

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.270
Similarly, apart from the cytotoxic function
there are also some other functions

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:27.600
inside the cells expressing
CD8 proteins.

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:31.400
So, it would be more correct 
to use CD4 and CD8

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.080
rather than talking 
about cooperative and cytotoxic cells.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.080
However, it is a convention 
that many immunologists use.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:43.100
The CD8 of these alpha beta cells
is mainly the evolved CD8.

00:01:43.348 --> 00:01:46.731
The CD8 alpha beta 
has a chain of every type;

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.920
there is a disulfide bond between them;
But a little proportion of cells

00:01:51.097 --> 00:01:54.300
can still express 
the old co-receptor: the alpha alpha.

00:01:54.514 --> 00:01:58.170
we have seen before that this co-receptor
was the one expressed by gamma delta lymphocytes.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.450
Let's focus on cytotoxic lymphocytes,

00:02:03.554 --> 00:02:06.550
that is, those that express CD8.

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:09.320
What type of cells are these?

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.420
From the point of view of their activation,
both CD4 and CD8,

00:02:14.594 --> 00:02:17.000
if we analyze them 
in people like you,

00:02:17.097 --> 00:02:20.970
healthy adults, we will see 
they appear in the same proportion.

00:02:21.154 --> 00:02:24.950
Half of them are virgins or naive,
and half of them are memory cells.

00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.820
These proportions gradually change 
according to age.

00:02:28.022 --> 00:02:32.000
So a new-born has 
100% of virgin cells

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.850
and no memory cells.

00:02:34.274 --> 00:02:38.520
As we grow up,
we contact with pathogens,

00:02:38.651 --> 00:02:43.170
and naturally these virgin cells gradually 
seem to show characteristics of memory cells

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.000
and these proportions start to change.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.817
We would reach old age 
with a vast majority of memory cells.

00:02:49.908 --> 00:02:56.970
They will never be 100% because
 we will never contact all the antigens

00:02:57.085 --> 00:02:58.720
against which we are prepared.

00:02:58.853 --> 00:03:01.450
So, we will always have
virgin cells,

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.750
no matter how old the person is.

48
00:03:05,973 --&gt; 00:03:11,170
From the point of view 
of their function,

00:03:11.573 --> 00:03:15.270
what are these CD8 cells?
Look, they can be regulatory cells.

00:03:15.426 --> 00:03:20.670
In this graphic, you can see three types of cells 
taken from a review in 2006.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:23.900
It talks about cells called NKT.

00:03:24.013 --> 00:03:30.150
Pay attention. In fact they are not NK cells.
they are T cells with NK function.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.970
We also have regulatory CD8 positive cells,

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:39.100
and we finally have regulatory 
CD8 positive - CD28 negative cells

00:03:39.546 --> 00:03:46.650
This is from 2006; but there is a more recent research
on this subject about the Tregs

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.800
in which all the regulatory cells
are called the same way.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.386
So there are two big subpopulations 
of CD8 cells with regulatory activity:

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.920
NKT cells,
that we have studied one second ago,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.020
and CD8 cells,
that have the alpha alpha co-receptor.

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:07.986
Therefore, as you can see,
this regulation can be made

00:04:08.053 --> 00:04:12.200
by both alpha beta cells 
and gamma delta cells.

00:04:13.573 --> 00:04:18.250
Apart from all these regulatory cells,
of course we have cytotoxic cells.

00:04:18.413 --> 00:04:23.350
Thus, inside of CD8 cells 
we can find pure cytotoxic cells.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.750
They are also known as CTL
and were formerly called suppressor cells.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.120
Nowadays they are called regulatory or Tregs
among which we have mentioned NKTs,

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.400
CD8 alpha alpha
those which have CD8 and lack CD28.

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:45.200
Let's continue 
with the most complicated population by far:

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.370
those which express the CD4 co-receptor.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.150
These CD4 cells, 
when they have not been activated before,

00:04:54.346 --> 00:04:58.373
are called Th0. the are the ones
represented in the middle: Th naive.

00:04:58.506 --> 00:05:04.150
As you can see, there are different types of development 
or differentiation of these cells.

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:06.770
We will see it in detail 
in future pills.

00:05:06.946 --> 00:05:10.350
So, do not worry about it 
since we will see it in detail.

00:05:10.813 --> 00:05:15.670
For now, our only interest is knowing that
there are regulatory cells inside the CD4 cells.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.720
Some of them are differentiated 
directly in the thymus;

00:05:18.973 --> 00:05:24.270
they are called nTregs
or natural regulatory cells.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.420
Amd some others are differentiated in circulation,
form example, iTregs,

00:05:29.626 --> 00:05:32.520
that are induced,
and Tr1 cells.

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.950
But also, inside CD4 cells,
when they are activated

00:05:37.133 --> 00:05:40.720
they can be differentiated 
into cells that cooperate with B lymphocytes.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.820
Here two big subtypes have been identified:
the so-called Th2

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:50.586
and the so-called TFh, ,
which are in lymphoid follicles.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:58.470
Finally, there is another type of cells
or another subtype of T CD4 cells,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:01.820
which can be differentiated 
into proinflammatory cells.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.820
In this group, we find Th1,
Th17, Th9 cells

00:06:08.013 --> 00:06:12.770
and Th22 cells, which have been
discovered recently.

00:06:13.586 --> 00:06:18.250
In which sense is all this puzzle different,
all this big number of TCD4 cells?

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:21.800
The answer is that 
all of them synthesize cytokines,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.550
but cytokines of different types.

00:06:24.746 --> 00:06:28.800
We will study it in detail in 
future pills.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.820
Now we are just 
drawing the main subtypes.

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:36.933
Therefore, we have those 
which have not been activated: Th0 cells;

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:43.470
those which collaborate with B lymphocytes;
those from lymphoid follicles: ThF; and Th2 cells;

00:06:43.826 --> 00:06:49.300
those whicha are more proinflammatory:
Th1, Th17, Th9 and Th22;

00:06:49.466 --> 00:06:54.250
all the regulatory cells,
either central or induced in the periphery.

00:06:54.506 --> 00:06:59.470
This is the big final framework 
of all the subtypes of lymphocytes

00:06:59.586 --> 00:07:04.600
that we have in blood 
and that you should remember always.

00:07:05.146 --> 00:07:09.970
In conclusion, in this immunopill we have studied
the subtypes of alpha beta T lymphocytes,

00:07:10.186 --> 00:07:15.750
the subtypes of CD8 T lymphocytes,
the subtypes of CD4 T lymphocytes,

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:18.800
which of them have a
regulatory function

00:07:19.053 --> 00:07:21.650
and which of them have a effector
or memory function.

00:07:22.866 --> 00:07:26.370
So, if you have understood everything
you should answer the following questions:

00:07:26.746 --> 00:07:29.770
What are the main subtypes of CD8 cells?

00:07:30.213 --> 00:07:34.220
What are two regulatory subtypes 
inside of these CD8 cells?

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:37.470
What two big subtypes

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.320
have the effector lymphocytes 
that we have defined?

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.050
What are the subtypes 
of Th regulatory lymphocytes

00:07:44.186 --> 00:07:45.900
that are known so far?

00:07:46.226 --> 00:07:50.820
And, finally, what factor or factors
make possible that

00:07:51.173 --> 00:07:55.400
a Th0,virgin lymphocyte,
is differentiated into one type or another,

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:57.120
into effector or regulator?

00:07:57.653 --> 00:08:01.070
If you know all the answers,
move to the next pill.

00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:06.320
Otherwise, review 
the contents again! See you soon!
