anybody ever wants a pair of fifteens I

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.640 
anybody ever wants a pair of fifteens I
would<00:03:48.269> recommend<00:03:48.750> going<00:03:48.900> a<00:03:49.170> half<00:03:49.409> size

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
would recommend going a half size

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.530 
would recommend going a half size
smaller<00:03:49.829> because<00:03:50.400> my<00:03:50.819> foot<00:03:51.090> goes<00:03:51.269> to<00:03:51.390> like

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
smaller because my foot goes to like

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:55.250 
smaller because my foot goes to like
right<00:03:51.719> here<00:03:52.260> and<00:03:52.590> these<00:03:52.769> are<00:03:52.950> my<00:03:53.099> size<00:03:54.260> so

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
right here and these are my size so

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.179 
right here and these are my size so
they're<00:03:55.439> the<00:03:55.620> same<00:03:55.829> way<00:03:55.980> with<00:03:56.129> those<00:03:58.819> so<00:04:01.189> this

00:04:02.179 --> 00:04:02.189 
they're the same way with those so this

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:05.270 
they're the same way with those so this
is<00:04:02.340> my<00:04:02.579> first<00:04:02.849> shoe<00:04:03.120> of<00:04:03.420> 2013<00:04:04.319> hopefully<00:04:05.129> it's

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
is my first shoe of 2013 hopefully it's

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
the first of many to come so if you're

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.819

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:25.889 
thought I would go ahead and throw that

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:34.430 
thought I would go ahead and throw that
in<00:04:26.160> anyway<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:29.570> yep<00:04:30.570> that's<00:04:31.440> about<00:04:31.560> it<00:04:33.440> if

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440
