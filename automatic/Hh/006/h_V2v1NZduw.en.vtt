instead<00:00:16.080> of<00:00:16.170> having<00:00:16.440> them<00:00:16.529> sticking<00:00:16.830> straight

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
instead of having them sticking straight

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.040 
instead of having them sticking straight
out<00:00:17.160> like<00:00:17.310> this<00:00:17.430> if<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:17.730> fold<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.240> canopy<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050

like<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.410> they<00:00:20.100> don't<00:00:20.250> face<00:00:20.520> the<00:00:20.730> same

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
like this they don't face the same

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.460 
like this they don't face the same
direction<00:00:21.180> as<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:21.570> the<00:00:21.660> movie<00:00:21.930> but<00:00:22.109> I<00:00:22.170> think

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
direction as in the movie but I think

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.840 
direction as in the movie but I think
having<00:00:22.680> them<00:00:22.830> up<00:00:22.980> there<00:00:23.130> like<00:00:23.279> big<00:00:23.490> shoulder

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
having them up there like big shoulder

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.160 
having them up there like big shoulder
pads<00:00:23.880> really<00:00:24.359> kind<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.600> gives<00:00:24.840> them<00:00:24.900> a<00:00:24.990> good

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.139 
pods up and then fold these panels up to
kind<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:45.899> give<00:00:46.050> them<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> four<00:00:46.649> towered<00:00:47.280> look

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
kind of give them that four towered look

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.369 
kind of give them that four towered look
like<00:00:48.329> he<00:00:48.420> had<00:00:48.570> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.719> movie<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.020> know<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.289> the

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
like he had in the movie I know in the

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
like he had in the movie I know in the
movie<00:00:49.469> he<00:00:49.739> had<00:00:49.920> like<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> thruster<00:00:50.640> here<00:00:50.879> and

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
movie he had like the thruster here and

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.900 
movie he had like the thruster here and
then<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> wing<00:00:51.539> off<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> thruster<00:00:52.350> over<00:00:52.559> here

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:52.910 
then the wing off the thruster over here

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
then the wing off the thruster over here
but<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.210> think<00:00:54.600> having<00:00:54.809> these<00:00:55.530> panels<00:00:56.010> up<00:00:56.160> like

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
but I think having these panels up like

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.939 
but I think having these panels up like
this<00:00:56.550> kind<00:00:57.420> of<00:00:57.449> helps<00:00:57.719> give<00:00:58.469> them<00:00:58.590> more<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> a

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
this kind of helps give them more of a

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.209 
this kind of helps give them more of a
movie<00:00:59.280> movie<00:00:59.760> quality<00:01:00.000> look<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:01.129> figured<00:01:02.129> I'll

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
movie movie quality look I figured I'll

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.539 
movie movie quality look I figured I'll
turn<00:01:02.399> them<00:01:02.460> around<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:02.879> can<00:01:03.000> see<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> back

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:04.549 
turn them around so you can see the back

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.609 
turn them around so you can see the back
that's<00:01:05.549> high<00:01:05.700> over<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:05.850> back<00:01:06.060> post<00:01:06.409> I'm<00:01:07.409> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that's high over the back post I'm to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.590 
that's high over the back post I'm to
get<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:07.920> look<00:01:10.130> but<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.000> biggest<00:01:12.180> change

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
get that look but the the biggest change

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.780 
get that look but the the biggest change
here<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:12.930> the<00:01:13.049> feet<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.400> wasn't

determine who was the first person to do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.969

it but it isn't I just want to make sure

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.710 
it but it isn't I just want to make sure
you<00:01:26.549> know<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.790> didn't<00:01:27.150> come<00:01:27.270> up<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.450> this

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you know I didn't come up with this

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.609 
you know I didn't come up with this
somebody<00:01:27.930> on<00:01:28.170> transformers<00:01:28.860> world<00:01:29.009> 2005<00:01:29.670> I

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:30.619 
somebody on transformers world 2005 I

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:32.630 
somebody on transformers world 2005 I
came<00:01:31.619> up<00:01:31.740> with<00:01:31.770> how<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.009> flip<00:01:32.250> these<00:01:32.369> feet

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240 
came up with how to flip these feet
around<00:01:33.380> but<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.409> think<00:01:34.470> it<00:01:34.710> looks<00:01:34.740> really<00:01:34.890> good

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
around but I think it looks really good

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.580 
around but I think it looks really good
with<00:01:35.460> all<00:01:35.610> of<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:36.030> cable<00:01:36.329> up<00:01:36.450> here<00:01:36.720> arranged

with all of the cable up here arranged
this<00:01:37.710> way<00:01:37.890> just<00:01:38.670> gives<00:01:38.850> you<00:01:38.970> a<00:01:39.030> much<00:01:39.329> more

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:39.920 
this way just gives you a much more

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.010 
this way just gives you a much more
awesome<00:01:40.920> looking<00:01:41.130> Prime<00:01:41.689> and<00:01:42.689> all<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.930> have

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020

to<00:01:43.110> do<00:01:43.229> here<00:01:43.560> I'll<00:01:44.130> flip<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.460> wheel<00:01:44.640> up<00:01:44.790> if

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
to do here I'll flip this wheel up if

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.230 
to do here I'll flip this wheel up if
you<00:01:45.600> can<00:01:45.720> see<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.820> instead<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.939> connecting

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
you can see that instead of connecting

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.999 
you can see that instead of connecting
in<00:01:48.540> with<00:01:48.630> his<00:01:48.750> feet<00:01:48.990> onto<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.439> basically

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
in with his feet onto this basically

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.499 
in with his feet onto this basically
just<00:01:50.159> turn<00:01:50.369> this<00:01:50.460> foot<00:01:50.700> around<00:01:50.970> at<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.180> ankle

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
just turn this foot around at the ankle

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
just turn this foot around at the ankle
and<00:01:51.689> fold<00:01:52.409> this<00:01:52.560> under<00:01:52.710> piece<00:01:53.009> up<00:01:53.250> up<00:01:54.119> like

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and fold this under piece up up like

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.929 
and fold this under piece up up like
this<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.899> then<00:01:55.829> this<00:01:56.189> this<00:01:56.460> piece<00:01:56.700> right<00:01:56.880> here

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
this and then this this piece right here

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.670 
this and then this this piece right here
that<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.420> normally<00:01:57.570> sit<00:01:58.020> back<00:01:58.200> here<00:01:58.469> as<00:01:58.560> the

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
that would normally sit back here as the

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.920 
that would normally sit back here as the
heel<00:01:59.009> just<00:01:59.700> flip<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.149> under<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:00.479> connectors

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
heel just flip that under the connectors

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.280 
heel just flip that under the connectors
and<00:02:01.170> then<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:03.420> won't<00:02:03.570> have<00:02:03.630> two<00:02:03.930> connectors

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
and then you won't have two connectors

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.420 
and then you won't have two connectors
you'll<00:02:04.439> only<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:04.680> using<00:02:04.710> one<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
you'll only be using one but that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.770 
you'll only be using one but that
connector<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:05.939> bottom<00:02:06.240> of<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.360> foot<00:02:06.570> does

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
connector on the bottom of the foot does

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.240 
connector on the bottom of the foot does
in<00:02:06.869> fact<00:02:07.049> connect<00:02:07.439> right<00:02:07.560> onto<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.950> tab

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
in fact connect right onto that tab

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.600 
in fact connect right onto that tab
there<00:02:08.580> and<00:02:09.390> holds<00:02:09.599> it<00:02:09.690> very<00:02:09.869> solidly<00:02:10.259> in<00:02:10.410> place

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
there and holds it very solidly in place

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.770 
there and holds it very solidly in place
and<00:02:11.610> other<00:02:11.760> than<00:02:11.879> that<00:02:12.030> is<00:02:12.239> pretty<00:02:12.450> much<00:02:12.629> the

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
and other than that is pretty much the

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.380 
and other than that is pretty much the
standard

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
standard

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.110 
standard
Jetfire<00:02:14.100> combination<00:02:15.100> with<00:02:15.220> prawn<00:02:15.490> the<00:02:15.670> only

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
Jetfire combination with prawn the only

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.520 
Jetfire combination with prawn the only
other<00:02:16.270> change<00:02:16.540> is<00:02:16.750> that<00:02:16.900> with<00:02:17.410> this

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
other change is that with this

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.260 
other change is that with this
configuration<00:02:17.830> that's<00:02:18.430> it's<00:02:18.640> too<00:02:18.820> far<00:02:19.060> back

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
configuration that's it's too far back

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.090 
configuration that's it's too far back
so<00:02:19.300> you<00:02:19.570> don't<00:02:19.780> use<00:02:20.050> the<00:02:20.260> waste<00:02:20.650> connector

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
so you don't use the waste connector

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.760 
so you don't use the waste connector
which<00:02:21.280> was<00:02:22.000> kind<00:02:22.270> of<00:02:22.330> an<00:02:22.420> iffy<00:02:22.540> connector<00:02:23.110> as

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
which was kind of an iffy connector as

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.100 
which was kind of an iffy connector as
it<00:02:24.100> was<00:02:24.220> anyway<00:02:24.550> but<00:02:25.420> I<00:02:25.450> just<00:02:25.660> want<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.020> give

it was anyway but I just want to give

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.500 
it was anyway but I just want to give
