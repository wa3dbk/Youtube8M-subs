hey<00:00:06.660> everyone<00:00:07.049> I'm<00:00:07.379> Lisa<00:00:07.710> DeFazio<00:00:08.490> registered

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
hey everyone I'm Lisa DeFazio registered

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.230 
hey everyone I'm Lisa DeFazio registered
dietitian<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.320> host<00:00:10.769> good<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> see<00:00:11.880> you<00:00:12.030> again

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:12.240 
dietitian and host good to see you again

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.930 
dietitian and host good to see you again
we're<00:00:13.139> talking<00:00:13.170> about<00:00:13.710> protein<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.700> think

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
we're talking about protein and I think

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.760 
we're talking about protein and I think
it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.150> really<00:00:15.330> important<00:00:15.839> topic<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.379> address

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
it's a really important topic to address

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.080 
it's a really important topic to address
because<00:00:17.310> there<00:00:17.820> are<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:17.940> lot<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
because there are a lot of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.510 
because there are a lot of
misconceptions<00:00:18.960> about<00:00:19.109> protein<00:00:19.800> when<00:00:20.430> we

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
misconceptions about protein when we

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.429 
misconceptions about protein when we
want<00:00:20.699> to<00:00:20.820> lose<00:00:20.970> weight<00:00:21.210> what<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.570> we<00:00:21.689> do<00:00:21.869> we<00:00:22.170> cut

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
want to lose weight what do we do we cut

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.679 
want to lose weight what do we do we cut
the<00:00:22.590> cards<00:00:23.010> we<00:00:23.250> eat<00:00:23.430> all<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:23.970> protein<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
the cards we eat all the protein in the

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.720 
the cards we eat all the protein in the
world<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.230> then<00:00:25.320> we<00:00:25.470> load<00:00:25.710> up<00:00:25.769> on<00:00:26.039> vegetables

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
world and then we load up on vegetables

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.970 
world and then we load up on vegetables
and<00:00:27.000> maybe<00:00:27.150> even<00:00:27.359> eliminate<00:00:27.930> fruit<00:00:28.199> those<00:00:28.800> are

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
and maybe even eliminate fruit those are

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.429 
and maybe even eliminate fruit those are
so<00:00:29.189> paranoid<00:00:29.490> about<00:00:29.760> the<00:00:30.179> carbs<00:00:30.630> while<00:00:31.199> there

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
so paranoid about the carbs while there

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:32.990 
so paranoid about the carbs while there
are<00:00:31.470> things<00:00:31.800> about<00:00:31.890> protein<00:00:32.520> that<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.790> need

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
are things about protein that you need

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.180 
are things about protein that you need
to<00:00:33.120> be<00:00:33.270> aware<00:00:33.390> of<00:00:33.630> because<00:00:34.110> protein<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> not<00:00:35.160> a

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
to be aware of because protein is not a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.420 
to be aware of because protein is not a
free<00:00:35.670> food<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.390> protein<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.710> do<00:00:38.010> you<00:00:38.160> more

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
free food and protein can do you more

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.319 
free food and protein can do you more
harm<00:00:38.460> than<00:00:38.969> good<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> course<00:00:40.170> let's<00:00:40.680> define

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
harm than good so of course let's define

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.970 
harm than good so of course let's define
protein-protein<00:00:42.329> oftentimes<00:00:43.230> is<00:00:43.440> found<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
protein-protein oftentimes is found in

protein-protein oftentimes is found in
animal<00:00:44.610> products<00:00:44.940> you<00:00:45.690> know<00:00:45.809> turkey<00:00:46.320> dogs

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:47.059 
animal products you know turkey dogs

course<00:00:53.070> and<00:00:53.399> your<00:00:53.820> plant<00:00:54.149> proteins<00:00:54.690> like

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
course and your plant proteins like

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.200 
course and your plant proteins like
beans<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.860> peanut<00:00:56.190> butter<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:56.670> nuts<00:00:56.879> and

beans and peanut butter and nuts and
your<00:00:57.750> dairy<00:00:58.020> products<00:00:58.620> as<00:00:58.739> well<00:00:58.770> ice<00:00:59.219> cream

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
your dairy products as well ice cream

your dairy products as well ice cream
yogurt<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.539> cheese<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:02.129> when<00:01:02.430> we're<00:01:02.579> looking

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
yogurt and cheese so when we're looking

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.600 
yogurt and cheese so when we're looking
at<00:01:03.030> protein<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:04.379> know<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.619> bottom<00:01:04.769> line<00:01:05.010> is

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
at protein you know the bottom line is

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.880 
at protein you know the bottom line is
that<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:06.240> should<00:01:06.510> have<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:07.200> actually<00:01:07.619> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
that you should have and actually a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.730 
that you should have and actually a
study<00:01:08.250> came<00:01:08.520> out<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.450> position<00:01:09.900> paper<00:01:10.110> from

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
study came out and a position paper from

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.160 
study came out and a position paper from
the<00:01:10.799> american<00:01:11.220> college<00:01:11.549> of<00:01:11.670> sports<00:01:11.729> medicine

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
the american college of sports medicine

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.780 
the american college of sports medicine
that<00:01:13.170> said<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.530> people<00:01:14.070> should<00:01:14.280> aim<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.490> have

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that said that people should aim to have

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.710 
that said that people should aim to have
0<00:01:15.090> point<00:01:15.450> 5<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:16.290> point<00:01:16.320> 8<00:01:16.890> grams<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:18.180> protein

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
0 point 5 to point 8 grams of protein

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.130 
0 point 5 to point 8 grams of protein
per<00:01:19.290> pound<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:20.369> body<00:01:20.549> weight<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.780> let's<00:01:21.990> say

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
per pound of body weight so let's say

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.710 
per pound of body weight so let's say
you<00:01:22.170> weigh<00:01:22.409> 150<00:01:23.220> pounds<00:01:23.390> we're<00:01:24.390> going<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.600> take

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you weigh 150 pounds we're going to take

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.830 
you weigh 150 pounds we're going to take
150<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.890> multiply<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.460> by<00:01:26.700> 0<00:01:26.909> point<00:01:27.270> 8<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
150 and multiply that by 0 point 8 and

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.990 
150 and multiply that by 0 point 8 and
doing<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.229> my<00:01:28.259> calculator<00:01:28.860> here<00:01:29.189> comes<00:01:29.790> to

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
doing it on my calculator here comes to

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.140 
doing it on my calculator here comes to
about<00:01:30.180> 120<00:01:30.930> grams<00:01:31.140> of<00:01:31.380> protein<00:01:31.640> and<00:01:32.640> on<00:01:33.030> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
about 120 grams of protein and on the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.670 
about 120 grams of protein and on the
lower<00:01:33.329> end<00:01:33.450> of<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.900> when<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> multiply<00:01:34.290> it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
lower end of that when you multiply it

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.850 
lower end of that when you multiply it
by<00:01:34.799> 0<00:01:34.920> point<00:01:35.189> 5<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.299> 75<00:01:37.020> grams<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.650> protein

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
by 0 point 5 we get 75 grams of protein

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.950 
by 0 point 5 we get 75 grams of protein
well<00:01:38.610> sometimes<00:01:38.850> on<00:01:39.210> these<00:01:39.329> high<00:01:39.509> protein

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
well sometimes on these high protein

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.280 
well sometimes on these high protein
diets<00:01:40.409> people<00:01:41.009> are<00:01:41.100> eating<00:01:41.220> 150<00:01:42.180> 200<00:01:42.750> grams<00:01:43.049> of

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
diets people are eating 150 200 grams of

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.370 
diets people are eating 150 200 grams of
protein<00:01:43.530> so<00:01:44.250> why<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.610> a<00:01:44.790> problem<00:01:45.380> protein

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
protein so why is that a problem protein

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.429 
protein so why is that a problem protein
foods<00:01:46.799> except<00:01:47.640> for<00:01:47.850> a<00:01:47.880> plant<00:01:48.570> protein<00:01:49.020> protein

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
foods except for a plant protein protein

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
foods except for a plant protein protein
foods<00:01:50.009> from<00:01:50.250> animal<00:01:50.729> products<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.360> going<00:01:51.540> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
foods from animal products are going to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.530 
foods from animal products are going to
have<00:01:51.720> cholesterol<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.649> saturated<00:01:53.220> fat<00:01:53.939> so

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
have cholesterol and saturated fat so

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.630 
have cholesterol and saturated fat so
this<00:01:54.750> stuff<00:01:55.020> clogs<00:01:55.350> your<00:01:55.500> arteries<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.310> if

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
this stuff clogs your arteries and if

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.120 
this stuff clogs your arteries and if
you<00:01:56.729> load<00:01:56.939> up<00:01:57.119> on<00:01:57.270> protein<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.200> well<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.799> really

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
you load up on protein as well it really

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.399 
you load up on protein as well it really
puts<00:01:59.460> your<00:01:59.549> kidneys<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.270> overdrive<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
puts your kidneys and the overdrive this

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:02.959 
puts your kidneys and the overdrive this
is<00:02:01.590> why<00:02:01.740> you're<00:02:01.979> told<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.520> you're<00:02:02.579> on<00:02:02.759> a<00:02:02.820> high

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
is why you're told when you're on a high

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.880 
is why you're told when you're on a high
protein<00:02:03.180> diet<00:02:03.719> that<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.170> have<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.409> drink<00:02:04.619> tons

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
protein diet that you have to drink tons

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.039 
protein diet that you have to drink tons
and<00:02:05.130> tons<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.490> water<00:02:05.700> because<00:02:06.420> it<00:02:06.540> helps<00:02:06.810> flush

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
and tons of water because it helps flush

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.529 
and tons of water because it helps flush
your<00:02:07.290> kidneys<00:02:07.799> people<00:02:08.580> with<00:02:08.700> diabetes<00:02:08.910> and

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
your kidneys people with diabetes and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.210 
your kidneys people with diabetes and
high<00:02:09.629> blood<00:02:09.660> pressure<00:02:10.200> also<00:02:10.530> have<00:02:10.890> to<00:02:11.069> be

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
high blood pressure also have to be

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.770 
high blood pressure also have to be
aware<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.030> those<00:02:12.209> men

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
aware that those men

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.720 
aware that those men
conditions<00:02:13.380> are<00:02:13.500> already<00:02:13.950> affecting<00:02:14.610> your

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
conditions are already affecting your

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.240 
conditions are already affecting your
kidneys<00:02:15.209> so<00:02:15.750> on<00:02:15.930> top<00:02:16.170> of<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> eat<00:02:16.890> all

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
kidneys so on top of that if you eat all

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.370 
kidneys so on top of that if you eat all
this<00:02:17.430> protein<00:02:18.090> you're<00:02:18.660> really<00:02:18.930> going<00:02:19.080> to<00:02:19.140> work

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
this protein you're really going to work

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.050 
this protein you're really going to work
your<00:02:19.560> kidneys<00:02:20.010> harder<00:02:20.430> than<00:02:20.610> they<00:02:20.760> need<00:02:21.030> to

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
your kidneys harder than they need to

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.990 
your kidneys harder than they need to
and<00:02:21.569> it<00:02:21.870> can<00:02:22.020> actually<00:02:22.230> lead<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> more<00:02:23.459> kidney

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and it can actually lead to more kidney

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.650 
and it can actually lead to more kidney
problems<00:02:24.630> so<00:02:25.230> a<00:02:25.260> high-protein<00:02:26.010> diet<00:02:26.490> is<00:02:26.850> ok

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
problems so a high-protein diet is ok

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.870 
problems so a high-protein diet is ok
but<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.440> really<00:02:28.650> want<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.100> watch<00:02:29.250> your<00:02:29.550> levels

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
but you really want to watch your levels

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.970 
but you really want to watch your levels
of<00:02:30.000> protein<00:02:30.270> and<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.020> wouldn't<00:02:31.350> go<00:02:31.470> over<00:02:31.500> that

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
of protein and I wouldn't go over that

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.610 
of protein and I wouldn't go over that
120<00:02:32.760> mark<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:33.239> do<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.750> math<00:02:33.959> for<00:02:34.230> your<00:02:34.470> own

body weight because obviously if you
weigh<00:02:36.630> more<00:02:36.959> you<00:02:37.380> can<00:02:37.560> get<00:02:37.709> away<00:02:37.800> with<00:02:38.220> more

all of that so really be cautious about

all of that so really be cautious about
that<00:02:52.500> protein<00:02:53.310> is<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.940> free<00:02:54.360> food<00:02:54.840> that's

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 
that protein is not a free food that's
