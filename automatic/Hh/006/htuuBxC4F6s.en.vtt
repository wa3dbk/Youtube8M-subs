piece<00:04:44.190> that<00:04:44.970> one<00:04:45.240> was<00:04:45.479> for<00:04:45.810> the<00:04:46.639> little<00:04:47.639> stick

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
piece that one was for the little stick

piece that one was for the little stick
in<00:04:48.180> the<00:04:48.300> middle<00:04:48.470> there<00:04:49.470> and<00:04:49.710> it's<00:04:50.669> got<00:04:50.850> this

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
in the middle there and it's got this

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.490 
in the middle there and it's got this
rubber<00:04:52.039> seal<00:04:53.039> on<00:04:53.220> it<00:04:53.910> as<00:04:54.060> well<00:04:54.270> I'll<00:04:55.229> show<00:04:55.470> you

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
rubber seal on it as well I'll show you

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.520 
rubber seal on it as well I'll show you
on<00:04:55.680> the<00:04:55.800> broken<00:04:56.190> piece<00:04:56.370> it's<00:04:56.580> easier

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
on the broken piece it's easier

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.020 
on the broken piece it's easier
especially<00:04:58.530> with<00:04:59.039> one<00:04:59.520> hand<00:05:00.889> there<00:05:02.030> this

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
especially with one hand there this

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.360 
especially with one hand there this
rubber<00:05:03.300> seal<00:05:03.630> is<00:05:04.380> important<00:05:05.039> because

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:05.370 
rubber seal is important because

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.990 
rubber seal is important because
otherwise<00:05:06.350> this<00:05:07.350> is<00:05:07.680> keeping<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.220> Reina<00:05:08.610> okay

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
otherwise this is keeping the Reina okay

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.510 
otherwise this is keeping the Reina okay
you<00:05:09.060> got<00:05:09.330> the<00:05:09.479> idea<00:05:09.680> so<00:05:10.680> that's<00:05:10.830> how<00:05:11.220> long<00:05:11.250> it

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520 
you got the idea so that's how long it

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.330 
you got the idea so that's how long it
takes<00:05:11.789> to<00:05:11.880> take<00:05:12.270> it<00:05:12.419> apart<00:05:13.280> assembling<00:05:14.280> in

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:14.340 
takes to take it apart assembling in

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:15.700 
takes to take it apart assembling in
reverse<00:05:14.580> order

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:15.710 
reverse order

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.070 
reverse order
super<00:05:16.710> straightforward
