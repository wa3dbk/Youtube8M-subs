00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:08.660
 hello here is another message 

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.669
 tell me how to insert an image into the window 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.599
 3d max 15 fit it to size 

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:22.170
 models but these questions we already have a lot 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:24.000
 dismantled and about 2-3 months ago it was 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.540
 very big discussion both in different 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.579
 emotions put the enemy in the background 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:36.030
 in the fifteenth maxi we have no insert 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:40.530
 background alt b key call by 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.859
 The ground button has no zones and pan 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:50.760
 increase to replace it somehow 

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:55.649
 Now I will show you on the example of this 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.979
 here you can use plain plain 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:04.909
 you can use plain + 1 + this 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:08.909
 my little violin was given 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:12.000
 much earlier let's see how with 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.009
 using plain plus we can do it 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.490
 here do this one for example 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:24.590
 a leaf here he immediately inserts a picture 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:33.060
 can also be using the plaine 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:35.520
 build plain now go to 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:41.329
 image of the picture and just it 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:46.200
 drag the call key 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:49.259
 materials take this pipette take 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:54.240
 this material that we put on this 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:58.950
 plane and go to the masses open 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:01.759
 we're right here's the texture sometimes she doesn't 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:04.170
 triggered go here's the texture and 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:07.640
 finger he don't know how to do it 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.170
 pronounced and we already see in normal 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.619
 image and then again switch to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.619
 texture 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.660
 so we have assigned this 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:21.690
 texture 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:28.480
 now go to put uvw map 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:32.380
 coordinates off here real here 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.209
 this tick and we see that on our 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.540
 planes just as well appeared 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:40.420
 crocs image on plain plus now 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:45.340
 so that we can work normally as in 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.690
 thirteenth maxi with there was a question like 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.400
 fit size 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:56.410
 Well, for example, we need this leaf 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:04.360
 build let's say 100 by 50 size 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:18.730
 take a rectangle and set the size of the table 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:22.209
 at 50 let's make it black so no 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:26.769
 black is not suitable let's do 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:35.650
 any bright yellow now 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:38.620
 go to our plain and just 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.170
 scale and customize to fit us 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:45.510
 size if now in height 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.510
 w is moving 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:55.390
 English scaling and easy 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:04:01.379
 customize the size can be like this 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:04:11.620
 do right click on the icon 

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:15.609
 scaling vertically fitted 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:18.630
 now horizontally we can see 

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.400
 here is how the numbers can be changed here 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:34.660
 for more accurate you can here 10 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:37.690
 use already here so it turns out 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.110
 we drove our message under the one we need 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:41.680
 the size 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:48.780
 now in order for us to work 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:52.240
 by f3 is the inclusion of edges so that we have 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:53.070
 There was a picture of our pictures on 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.760
 the screen 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:05:01.960
 here is the main element which we 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:05.500
 with which we begin to work was visible 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:11.490
 how to make the edges for this 

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:21.310
 operation we need references 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:25.720
 create a new layer more convenient better immediately 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:31.240
 call your by name what's there 

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:34.409
 happens now with the right mouse button 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.849
 select the properties of this layer 

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:42.280
 phrase show 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:42.940
 en gray turn off suppressed shadow caste 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.039
 shadow 

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:54.240
 turn off here freeze freeze and shadow 

00:05:48.039 --> 00:05:57.010
 shode okay now go to layer 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:06:02.500
 default that is, in which we will work 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:08.650
 turn on the blue light and in the same way 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:11.789
 start doing something if we now 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:16.270
 press f3 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:18.520
 we can see the edges and at the same 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:21.940
 time to see in the background 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:23.689
 normal reference plan which is not 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:27.750
 disappears 

00:06:23.689 --> 00:06:29.819
 I think answered the question and even better 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:33.569
 view previous posts there 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:37.259
 probably message 10-20 was on this topic 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.599
 how idle maxes get pictures on 

00:06:37.259 --> 00:06:43.340
 in the background 

00:06:38.599 --> 00:06:43.340
 goodbye see you next time
