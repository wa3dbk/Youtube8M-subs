00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
what's so special about your technology

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.310 
what's so special about your technology
we<00:01:47.430> have<00:01:47.729> more<00:01:48.090> experience<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:49.049> the

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
we have more experience in the

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
we have more experience in the
deployment<00:01:49.710> of<00:01:50.040> electric<00:01:50.549> vehicle

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939

anyone<00:01:53.970> else<00:01:54.149> does<00:01:54.390> we<00:01:54.990> pioneered<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.920> use<00:01:55.950> of

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
anyone else does we pioneered the use of

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.179 
anyone else does we pioneered the use of
four<00:01:56.729> motors<00:01:57.210> in<00:01:57.479> a<00:01:58.020> vehicle<00:01:58.409> driving<00:01:58.829> each

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
four motors in a vehicle driving each

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.709 
four motors in a vehicle driving each
wheel<00:01:59.460> no<00:01:59.820> one<00:01:59.969> had<00:02:00.060> ever<00:02:00.180> done<00:02:00.329> now<00:02:00.479> that's

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
wheel no one had ever done now that's

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.450 
wheel no one had ever done now that's
what<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> do<00:02:01.079> that's<00:02:01.469> what<00:02:02.100> you're<00:02:02.219> different

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
what you do that's what you're different

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.130 
what you do that's what you're different
that's<00:02:02.729> what<00:02:02.969> makes<00:02:03.180> us<00:02:03.390> different<00:02:03.420> but<00:02:03.990> we

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
that's what makes us different but we

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.319 
that's what makes us different but we
build<00:02:04.469> our<00:02:04.740> own<00:02:04.770> batteries<00:02:05.399> and<00:02:05.610> we<00:02:06.090> use

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
build our own batteries and we use

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.600 
build our own batteries and we use
American<00:02:06.740> components<00:02:07.740> when<00:02:08.099> we<00:02:08.280> put<00:02:08.489> our

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
American components when we put our

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.029 
American components when we put our
technology<00:02:09.209> together<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.989> our<00:02:10.170> battery<00:02:10.679> is<00:02:10.800> an

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
technology together so our battery is an

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.830 
technology together so our battery is an
American<00:02:11.489> battery<00:02:11.879> our<00:02:12.030> motor<00:02:12.330> comes<00:02:12.690> from

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
American battery our motor comes from

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.500 
American battery our motor comes from
America

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
America

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:15.059 
America
our<00:02:13.659> traction<00:02:14.080> controller<00:02:14.620> comes<00:02:14.860> from

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
our traction controller comes from

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.280 
our traction controller comes from
America<00:02:15.489> so<00:02:15.879> now<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.120> have<00:02:16.450> an<00:02:16.659> American

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
America so now you have an American

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.740 
America so now you have an American

now stop laughing people you don't see
me<00:03:01.540> driving<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:01.930> bus<00:03:02.430> okay<00:03:03.430> you<00:03:03.730> say<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.090> it's

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
me driving a bus okay you say that it's

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.930 
me driving a bus okay you say that it's
legit<00:03:04.900> for<00:03:05.139> a<00:03:05.319> route<00:03:05.709> so<00:03:06.310> it<00:03:06.459> comes<00:03:06.609> back<00:03:06.760> to

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
legit for a route so it comes back to
