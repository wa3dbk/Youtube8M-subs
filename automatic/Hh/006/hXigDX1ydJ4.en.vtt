00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 we've all played some game of 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.410
 driving there are not some that for more 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.660
 prestige of simulation or realism not 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.630
 they have enough damage or 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.660
 even those you have in this count 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.539
 I will say the 10 driving games with the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.300
 better damage 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.300
 put 10 we will have the creators of 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.480
 test drive demolition reister or how 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.169
 I remember the crash test drive was 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.329
 released in 1999 for playstation 1 the 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.489
 computer and later for 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.040
 dreamcast under the name of demolition 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.210
 razer does not exceed a great game in 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.550
 issue of the years 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.640
 impressed how he was losing the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.550
 chest the headlights and even how 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:50.190
 the engine burned down I have fun the 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.199
 game modes the career mode that 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.080
 for each shock we were joined by 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:58.049
 points or rodeo mode where they put us 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:59.820
 in a circular circuit to crash the 

00:00:58.049 --> 00:01:03.030
 best playstation games one that I 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.549
 remember maybe you have missed 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.750
 the damage the loss of tires like 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:08.750
 in the next game 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.170
 at number 9 we have a the 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.820
 strokes and boiled this is actually 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.890
 the father of destruction games 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.840
 vehicular destruction of the injured 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.090
 just like demolition ryser we put them 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 to crash in the points races the 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.900
 staff has some very good graphics 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.780
 for his time in that 1996 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:34.810
 and here yes it deformed a little less the 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.430
 car but what favors this is 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.620
 and here if the tires were lost 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.700
 then 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:45.170
 and if it was a little more smoke type 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.170
 even the sound was a bit better 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.349
 If you think that great factors is the 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.700
 most controversial game you are wrong in the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.550
 put number 8 we will have the first 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.140
 carmagedón carmagedón was a game where 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.510
 you could crush people or 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:21.209
 animals that walked happily through the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.480
 streets or fields what impressed 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:26.819
 to me personally is the achievement that 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.010
 he gave the graphic engine because the car 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.810
 totally deformable had damage 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:34.049
 mechanical as the engine will explode 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.970
 because the suspension no longer served this 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:38.370
 game is characterized in addition to crushing 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.280
 people for their very successful engine damage 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:47.870
 only veil completely deforms the 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.870
 car has its newbie look for it and play what 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.319
 everyone who has had a play 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.930
 station 2 an xbox and gamecube knows this 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.510
 saga berna where they ran a race 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.150
 street or made a time trial 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:09.600
 in an awesome car when the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.310
 crashing, exploding or falling apart 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.620
 We remember all their clashes 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.320
 amazing their amazing soundtrack and 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.780
 its excellent graphics I did not want to do 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.840
 this about a bribe because everyone 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.790
 they love and they are very good is clear 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.670
 because it is in this list your incredible 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.440
 damage to cars but what does not 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.620
 favors a lot is that there is no damage 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.620
 mechanics 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.129
 at number 6 finally we 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:39.319
 we found a toka race simulator 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.659
 driver two of the first games that 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.519
 I played in play station 2 they play like 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:46.280
 he had said is a racing simulator 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:48.230
 professionals where you become a 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.750
 rookie runner and totally unknown 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.780
 by all and where you should get to the most 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.700
 high of professional careers this 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.890
 Personal game has a few years 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.840
 excellent and perfect because the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.730
 body of the cars rests the 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.310
 crystals are broken the tires are 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.319
 bust or the headlights melt or where 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.560
 you lose a wheel and good bye 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.470
 race apart use brand cars 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:16.250
 real as aston martin audi mitsubishi 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:17.570
 opel or subaru for saying some examples and 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.389
 more than being a simulator 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:22.520
 racing also physics is good at 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:26.919
 this game especially in the events of 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.919
 rally of my favorites in the genre 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.450
 in the fifth place we are at 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.790
 need for speed shift widget 2 this saga 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.160
 of need for speed that were created to 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.680
 basis of legal careers at my point of 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.840
 view is better than the previous years 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:51.880
 they were improved although physics did not 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:53.470
 pleases a lot in estelí for speed 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.280
 it is as if the car bounced to very strong 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.930
 against the floor 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.300
 the game has the championship of 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.610
 automovilismo fia that is based on the 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.980
 cars type tourism the graphics are 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.389
 pretty good and if it's a good 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.970
 competitor against games like great 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:10.370
 tourism or strength if you like 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.720
 fia racing buy it and if you already 

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.720
 you have it take advantage 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:20.569
 in position number 4 we will have a flow 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:22.490
 2nd in very good competitor for burnout 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:24.620
 it even has better damage and 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:26.539
 explosions but also when it collides is 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.180
 very strong the driver shoots out 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:31.340
 for the windshield very good for your 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.710
 central era and its graphics are 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.199
 excellent if you like racing 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.159
 combat search on the internet and download it 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:39.159
 perfect for you 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:48.330
 at number 3 we will have driver 3 the 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.430
 Most popular saga of reflections trailer 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.590
 3 is characterized by being a sandbox like 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.780
 big lack of real cities like 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:57.210
 miami nice that is located in 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.220
 france and istanbul the years are very 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.630
 good I also like that when the 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:02.030
 car receives shots 

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.370
 these are notorious in the body 

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:07.440
 videos and vehicle tires in addition 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:10.910
 own vehicles of any kind like 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:13.139
 motorcycles trucks buses and forklifts 

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:15.930
 many people complain about the bugs that 

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:18.180
 he has this game but personally he is 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.310
 what makes it fun recommended 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.040
 for those who are already tired of big 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:25.110
 auto or want realism in shocks 

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:26.729
 in number 2 you find screams are 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:29.100
 note that codemasters dedicates a lot 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:31.530
 time to his damages in the games noises 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.360
 maintains a certain relationship with touches of 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:35.100
 some way here we are also 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.560
 they present real cars that are 

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.020
 totally deformable here when 

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:41.940
 you can return the time to 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:44.850
 avoid shock thing for me will 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.530
 removes realism compared to toca has 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:48.600
 some incredible years and very successful 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:49.900
 they even have the best physics that 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.729
 have noticed in a video 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:54.190
 like when you go through the lawn in 

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:56.229
 some track and the car jumps and overturns 

00:06:54.190 --> 00:06:59.310
 if you want destruction and fun 

00:06:56.229 --> 00:06:59.310
 buy yourself screams 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:04.230
 in number 1 you find the next 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:06.419
 game of the creators of fly out reaches 

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.460
 this game the best shocks game that 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.190
 I have played is that they have the best 

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.260
 damage ever done the car is crushed 

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:15.150
 completely like the carmagedón but to 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:16.979
 the time has a driving physics 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.440
 pretty good the game really 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.540
 impresses at first sight and when it comes to 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:23.940
 of the team that brought us fly out according to 

00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.080
 very big expectation the game is 

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:27.919
 is in development and is 

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.919
 available in steam 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:42.039
 and here comes the video of the 10 

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:44.710
 driving games with better damage 

00:07:42.039 --> 00:07:46.060
 from my point of view and if you have 

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:47.830
 some game that I did not mention 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.139
 by melo in the comments 

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:52.620
 I am going to walk and I wish you a happy 

00:07:50.139 --> 00:07:52.620
 week
