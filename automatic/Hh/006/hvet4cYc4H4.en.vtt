00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
click so this is our factory where we

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:08.179 
click so this is our factory where we
make<00:00:02.460> pallets<00:00:03.589> and<00:00:05.810> we<00:00:06.810> will<00:00:07.020> do<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.500> test<00:00:07.799> for

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
make pallets and we will do the test for

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.770 
make pallets and we will do the test for
you<00:00:08.519> as<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:09.059> requested<00:00:09.920> so<00:00:11.150> the<00:00:12.150> machines<00:00:12.570> are

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
you as you requested so the machines are

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.680 
you as you requested so the machines are
not<00:00:13.769> working<00:00:14.280> in<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.519> moment<00:00:14.940> their<00:00:15.299> pallets

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
not working in the moment their pallets

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.050 
not working in the moment their pallets
which<00:00:15.870> we<00:00:16.080> made<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.529> today<00:00:19.070> mainly<00:00:20.070> we<00:00:20.850> make

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
which we made this today mainly we make

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.470 
which we made this today mainly we make
pallets<00:00:21.480> from<00:00:21.810> sawdust<00:00:22.699> you<00:00:23.699> can<00:00:23.939> see<00:00:24.180> we<00:00:24.359> have

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
pallets from sawdust you can see we have

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.140 
pallets from sawdust you can see we have
got<00:00:24.510> quite<00:00:24.990> a<00:00:25.019> lot<00:00:25.320> of<00:00:25.519> good<00:00:26.519> sawdust<00:00:27.560> and<00:00:29.150> now

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
got quite a lot of good sawdust and now

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.680 
got quite a lot of good sawdust and now
I'm<00:00:30.810> walking<00:00:31.710> towards<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.520> big<00:00:33.149> back<00:00:33.450> you've

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
I'm walking towards the big back you've

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:38.900 
I'm walking towards the big back you've
sent<00:00:34.020> us<00:00:35.510> so<00:00:36.510> material<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.489> believe<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.670> this

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
sent us so material I believe is this

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:45.140 
sent us so material I believe is this
one

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.890 

she<00:00:46.150> sells<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.720> us

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:49.900 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:59.900 

and<00:00:51.480> let's<00:00:52.480> have<00:00:52.690> a<00:00:52.750> look<00:00:52.900> what's<00:00:53.170> inside<00:00:53.350> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470 

we<00:01:00.910> can<00:01:01.150> see<00:01:01.360> a<00:01:01.390> biomass<00:01:03.210> unfortunately<00:01:04.210> at

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:04.480 
we can see a biomass unfortunately at

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.530 
we can see a biomass unfortunately at
the<00:01:04.690> moment<00:01:04.720> it's<00:01:05.230> not<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:06.670> way<00:01:06.850> we<00:01:06.880> need<00:01:07.330> it

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
the moment it's not the way we need it

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.070 
the moment it's not the way we need it
you<00:01:08.380> can<00:01:08.590> see<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:08.980> light<00:01:09.310> bit<00:01:10.380> particles<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
you can see that light bit particles the

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.620 
you can see that light bit particles the
big<00:01:14.260> pieces<00:01:14.560> of<00:01:14.860> biomass<00:01:15.460> which<00:01:16.770> obviously

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
big pieces of biomass which obviously

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.780 
big pieces of biomass which obviously
are<00:01:19.630> not<00:01:20.140> fulfilling<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:21.010> requirement<00:01:21.730> that

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
are not fulfilling the requirement that

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.590 
are not fulfilling the requirement that
the<00:01:22.180> biomass<00:01:22.540> needs<00:01:22.960> to<00:01:23.229> be<00:01:23.410> shredded<00:01:24.190> up<00:01:24.600> to

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
the biomass needs to be shredded up to

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.250 
the biomass needs to be shredded up to
four<00:01:25.900> millimeters<00:01:27.030> maximum<00:01:28.030> of<00:01:28.860> of<00:01:29.860> size<00:01:31.260> so

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.260 
four millimeters maximum of of size so

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.630 
four millimeters maximum of of size so
we<00:01:32.440> will<00:01:32.680> shred<00:01:32.950> it<00:01:33.130> again<00:01:33.520> and<00:01:34.560> then<00:01:35.610> we<00:01:36.610> can

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
we will shred it again and then we can

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.609 
we will shred it again and then we can
make<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.060> tests<00:01:37.600> for<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:40.380> just<00:01:41.380> for<00:01:41.560> your

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
make the tests for you just for your

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.050 
make the tests for you just for your
understanding<00:01:41.710> this<00:01:42.700> is<00:01:42.940> the<00:01:43.180> dye<00:01:44.140> matrix<00:01:45.060> you

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
understanding this is the dye matrix you

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.960 
understanding this is the dye matrix you
push<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.600> material<00:01:46.810> through<00:01:47.500> this<00:01:48.220> dye<00:01:48.610> and

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
push the material through this dye and

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:52.530 
push the material through this dye and
you<00:01:49.000> get<00:01:49.869> the<00:01:50.229> pellets<00:01:50.680> on<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:50.979> other<00:01:51.160> side<00:01:51.540> so

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
you get the pellets on the other side so

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.060 
you get the pellets on the other side so
you<00:01:52.600> can<00:01:52.840> imagine<00:01:53.050> this<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.560> 6<00:01:53.800> millimeters

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
you can imagine this is 6 millimeters

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.720 
you can imagine this is 6 millimeters
dye<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.980> obviously<00:01:56.980> you<00:01:57.100> can<00:01:57.280> see<00:01:57.310> why<00:01:57.670> the

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
dye and obviously you can see why the

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.060 
dye and obviously you can see why the
size<00:01:58.180> of<00:01:58.450> your<00:01:58.600> material<00:01:59.110> it's<00:01:59.920> not

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
size of your material it's not

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.040 
size of your material it's not
acceptable

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:01.050 
acceptable

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.550 
acceptable
how<00:02:02.050> can<00:02:02.350> you<00:02:02.470> push<00:02:02.920> such<00:02:03.820> a<00:02:03.850> big<00:02:04.180> piece

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
how can you push such a big piece

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.210 
how can you push such a big piece
through<00:02:05.560> those<00:02:05.740> littler<00:02:06.270> little<00:02:07.270> holes<00:02:08.220> the

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
through those littler little holes the

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:12.500 
through those littler little holes the
material<00:02:09.670> needs<00:02:09.820> to<00:02:09.910> be<00:02:10.149> like<00:02:10.330> dust<00:02:11.130> sawdust

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
material needs to be like dust sawdust

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.920 
material needs to be like dust sawdust
so<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.810> were<00:02:13.989> shredded<00:02:14.440> now<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:14.950> then<00:02:15.930> show

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
so we were shredded now and then show

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.020 
so we were shredded now and then show
you<00:02:16.989> how<00:02:17.350> the<00:02:17.410> material<00:02:18.250> looks<00:02:18.340> differently

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
you how the material looks differently

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.229 
you how the material looks differently
and<00:02:19.560> it<00:02:20.560> will<00:02:20.980> give<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.340> much<00:02:21.580> better<00:02:21.880> results

00:02:22.229 --> 00:02:22.239 
and it will give you much better results

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:24.270 
and it will give you much better results
instead<00:02:23.080> of<00:02:23.200> stopping<00:02:23.470> the<00:02:23.769> machine<00:02:24.160> every

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
instead of stopping the machine every

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:59.440 
instead of stopping the machine every
time

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:01.720 

now<00:02:59.599> you<00:02:59.660> can<00:03:00.200> see<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.920> more<00:03:01.129> likely<00:03:01.370> what

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
now you can see this is more likely what

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:08.080 
now you can see this is more likely what
we<00:03:01.879> would<00:03:02.060> like<00:03:02.270> to<00:03:02.300> see

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.500 

nice<00:03:08.569> little<00:03:08.959> to<00:03:09.380> die

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
nice little to die

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.770 
nice little to die
so

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
so

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.309 
so
now<00:03:13.900> reverb<00:03:14.380> Sunseri<00:03:15.010> to<00:03:15.310> the<00:03:15.370> machine

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:17.319 
now reverb Sunseri to the machine

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.460 
now reverb Sunseri to the machine
and<00:03:17.560> see<00:03:17.950> what<00:03:18.340> the

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:25.860 

and<00:03:23.830> another<00:03:24.130> very<00:03:24.580> important<00:03:25.180> requirement

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
and another very important requirement

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.330 
and another very important requirement
for<00:03:26.080> the<00:03:26.230> biomass<00:03:26.710> is<00:03:26.980> that<00:03:27.310> it's<00:03:27.690> dry

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
for the biomass is that it's dry

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.700 
for the biomass is that it's dry
other<00:03:30.060> faces<00:03:30.630> say<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.140> should<00:03:31.380> be<00:03:31.530> up<00:03:31.680> to

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
other faces say it should be up to

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.630 
other faces say it should be up to
develop<00:03:32.490> their<00:03:33.000> sense<00:03:33.330> of<00:03:33.480> moisture<00:03:34.050> content

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
develop their sense of moisture content

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:40.150 
develop their sense of moisture content
we<00:03:35.640> have<00:03:35.670> got

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.160 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:50.410 

how<00:03:41.160> much<00:03:41.400> more<00:03:41.670> CEO<00:03:42.000> material<00:03:42.630> has<00:03:42.780> God

17<00:03:52.280> 8.9<00:03:53.280> we<00:03:53.910> can<00:03:54.060> measure<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.480> again<00:03:55.819> please

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:57.830 
17 8.9 we can measure it again please

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:03.580 
17 8.9 we can measure it again please
which<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:59.010> far<00:03:59.280> from<00:04:00.230> rectifier
