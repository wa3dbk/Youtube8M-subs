00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.040
 even after New Year's Eve the oliebollen was still available as hot cakes 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.430
 the counter on the Eindhoven market 

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.809
 but how do you bulky sell soufiane traders they sell it more 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.059
 antwerp bolat 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.959
 she can predict the future based on her tarot cards 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.769
 I think I wanted to know again what he will expect in 2011 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.849
 and very positive fact I suspect that psv is going to be our party again 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:28.460
 millings that it is very nice prospect 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.790
 He promised I should be on Europe on the map 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.989
 put I know Eindhoven in the food on certain points also 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.800
 but this is not only a party in Eindhoven 2011 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.170
 the people nice is that but the suspicion is that the recession and for the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.520
 small business owner 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.130
 thousands because that period is approaching I suspect that there will be more stores 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.090
 Close 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.100
 within the municipality, traders expect the necessary fireworks 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.950
 But I suspect that something is going on in public in the robbery 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.100
 the ball hit the post or something like that if the index ended up behind that 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.470
 to buy something but that something is going to be from the city, I suspect both 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.320
 we have teams, what do we find out? 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.380
 fraud or what then again well I do not know if the relationships between the 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.430
 revelation of the something that is going on so nothing at all we need one more 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:20.540
 whistleblower 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.660
 h but i'm sure it didn't hear 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.210
 whistleblowers 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.220
 register with the cwi d 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.020
 it will be a difficult year for the builders in eindhoven anyway 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.430
 I suspect that the iron beams are shut down for safety reasons 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.980
 to spur to the arm that made that choice city and that there are more 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.030
 We suspect that there are only a few eyes 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.499
 the city is laid 

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:48.670
 associated with traces at work it is 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:50.240
 at helmond eindhoven 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.890
 furthermore, in 2011 a pack of 16 from volkel more stops near 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 eindhoven 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.060
 fortunately the traps are not killed 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.140
 finally anp just heard deer weather forecast for 2011 in the summer 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.830
 I suspect them and it is a special getaway though the peaks 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.459
 deep valleys between ie when the weather fired it suddenly becomes whole 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:12.259
 long 

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:16.349
 and then the weather declined to peak but I suspect that we will in July 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.219
 no a heat wave going to run at the end of July that it is a heat wave 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:21.339
 to sit 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:24.079
 when is the turn this time over again this winter 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.629
 and ajax must now to the next three weeks that it remains a bit the number 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.069
 but that is well on its way 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.069
 return small at the end of January 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:35.919
 Hanoi 

00:02:35.919 --> 00:02:36.209
