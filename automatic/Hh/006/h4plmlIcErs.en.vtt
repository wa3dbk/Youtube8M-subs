he's just so fat that it doesn't really

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.790 
he's just so fat that it doesn't really
work<00:01:37.570> well<00:01:38.140> and<00:01:39.060> so<00:01:40.060> normally<00:01:40.960> he<00:01:40.990> just<00:01:41.140> walks

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
work well and so normally he just walks

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.450 
work well and so normally he just walks
around<00:01:42.040> she's<00:01:42.640> kind<00:01:42.850> of<00:01:42.910> a<00:01:43.030> bummer<00:01:43.330> you<00:01:43.600> know

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
around she's kind of a bummer you know

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.859 
around she's kind of a bummer you know
but<00:01:45.460> he<00:01:45.670> just<00:01:45.940> doesn't<00:01:46.180> really<00:01:46.479> care<00:01:46.750> about

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
but he just doesn't really care about

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.140 
but he just doesn't really care about
much<00:01:47.170> except<00:01:47.650> for<00:01:47.890> whether<00:01:48.400> or<00:01:48.550> not<00:01:48.610> his<00:01:48.820> food

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
much except for whether or not his food

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.500 
much except for whether or not his food
bowl<00:01:49.360> is<00:01:49.660> full<00:01:49.890> so<00:01:50.890> I<00:01:51.190> think<00:01:51.310> that<00:01:51.640> any<00:01:52.030> kind<00:01:52.420> of

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
bowl is full so I think that any kind of

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.420 
bowl is full so I think that any kind of
voice<00:01:52.750> for<00:01:53.020> him<00:01:53.200> would<00:01:53.320> be<00:01:53.380> pretty<00:01:53.800> good<00:01:54.100> I

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
voice for him would be pretty good I

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.010 
voice for him would be pretty good I
mean<00:01:54.820> if<00:01:54.970> you're<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.180> girl<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:55.510> you<00:01:55.630> can<00:01:55.810> do<00:01:55.990> a

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
mean if you're a girl and you can do a

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.350 
mean if you're a girl and you can do a
sort<00:01:56.619> of<00:01:56.740> boyish<00:01:56.979> force<00:01:57.400> that<00:01:57.790> would<00:01:57.940> be<00:01:58.119> fine

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
sort of boyish force that would be fine

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
sort of boyish force that would be fine
I<00:01:59.130> really<00:02:00.130> don't<00:02:00.310> care<00:02:00.369> who<00:02:00.729> does<00:02:00.910> it<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.780> next

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
I really don't care who does it and next

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.740 
I really don't care who does it and next
one<00:02:02.740> is<00:02:03.009> me<00:02:03.429> she<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:04.030> she's<00:02:04.979> somewhat<00:02:05.979> normal

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
one is me she and she's somewhat normal

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.810 
one is me she and she's somewhat normal
except<00:02:07.750> for<00:02:07.780> she's<00:02:08.440> scared<00:02:08.890> of<00:02:09.070> I<00:02:09.460> mean

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:09.820 
except for she's scared of I mean

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.120

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
terrified of any sort of food that's

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.900
