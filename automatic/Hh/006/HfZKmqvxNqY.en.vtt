got this question a lot from people who
follow<00:00:11.250> my<00:00:11.400> videos<00:00:11.730> they<00:00:12.240> want<00:00:12.509> to<00:00:12.599> know<00:00:12.780> how

do<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.559> hit<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:14.570> one-handed<00:00:15.570> backhand<00:00:16.260> on<00:00:16.470> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
do you hit a one-handed backhand on the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.519 
do you hit a one-handed backhand on the
run<00:00:17.190> all<00:00:18.000> right<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.930> is<00:00:19.140> a<00:00:19.170> tough<00:00:19.500> one

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
run all right and this is a tough one

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.099 
run all right and this is a tough one
because<00:00:19.920> I<00:00:20.490> think<00:00:20.550> the<00:00:21.000> one<00:00:21.150> hander<00:00:21.570> has<00:00:21.750> some

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
because I think the one hander has some

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.550 
because I think the one hander has some
disadvantages<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.580> notice<00:00:23.850> more<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.180> more

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
disadvantages you notice more and more

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.009 
disadvantages you notice more and more
that<00:00:25.560> two<00:00:26.099> handers<00:00:26.490> are<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:27.359> Novak<00:00:27.750> Djokovic

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
that two handers are like Novak Djokovic

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.439 
that two handers are like Novak Djokovic
perfect<00:00:28.710> example<00:00:29.189> Serena<00:00:29.550> Williams<00:00:29.939> great

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
perfect example Serena Williams great

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.150 
perfect example Serena Williams great
able<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.660> run<00:00:30.869> out<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.230> get<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.439> lot<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.890> power

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
able to run out and get a lot of power

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.940 
able to run out and get a lot of power
on<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:33.059> open<00:00:33.750> stance<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.739> know<00:00:34.890> you

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
on the open stance we you know you

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.040 
on the open stance we you know you
rarely<00:00:35.520> see<00:00:35.790> someone<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.420> Roger<00:00:36.660> Federer

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
rarely see someone like Roger Federer

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.410 
rarely see someone like Roger Federer
hit<00:00:37.170> an<00:00:37.260> open<00:00:37.410> stance<00:00:37.829> one<00:00:38.070> here<00:00:38.280> back<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.850> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
hit an open stance one here back in so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.290 
hit an open stance one here back in so
we<00:00:39.450> swapped<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.930> cross<00:00:40.200> over<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.680> our<00:00:40.770> step

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
we swapped a cross over with our step

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.180 
we swapped a cross over with our step
but<00:00:42.300> being<00:00:43.050> able<00:00:43.140> to<00:00:43.260> really<00:00:43.469> time<00:00:43.800> out<00:00:44.010> your

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
but being able to really time out your

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.490 
but being able to really time out your
run<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:45.059> is<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.239> important<00:00:45.660> part<00:00:45.809> cuz

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
run I think is the important part cuz

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.580 
run I think is the important part cuz
people<00:00:46.969> don't<00:00:47.969> really<00:00:48.239> know<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:49.140> foot<00:00:49.530> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
people don't really know which foot is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.270 
people don't really know which foot is
supposed<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.280> land<00:00:50.879> in<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.930> order<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
supposed to land in which order and so

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.709 
supposed to land in which order and so
like<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.699> get<00:00:53.910> here<00:00:54.149> too<00:00:54.300> early<00:00:54.629> and

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
like if you get here too early and

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.869 
like if you get here too early and
you're<00:00:54.780> on<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:55.050> run<00:00:55.230> you<00:00:55.610> probably<00:00:56.610> felt

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
you're on the run you probably felt

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:58.369 
you're on the run you probably felt
locked<00:00:57.210> up<00:00:57.480> before<00:00:57.660> and<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.079> your<00:00:58.199> only

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
locked up before and that your only

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.229 
locked up before and that your only
option<00:00:58.800> is<00:00:58.920> to<00:00:59.160> hit<00:00:59.640> it<00:00:59.730> down<00:00:59.850> the<00:01:00.030> line<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
option is to hit it down the line that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.580 
option is to hit it down the line that
you<00:01:00.449> don't<00:01:00.539> even<00:01:00.690> really<00:01:00.840> feel<00:01:01.050> much<00:01:01.289> power

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you don't even really feel much power

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.410 
you don't even really feel much power
doing<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.670> what<00:01:02.789> we're<00:01:02.879> gonna<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.210> is<00:01:03.300> we're

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
doing so what we're gonna do is we're

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.299 
doing so what we're gonna do is we're
going<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> talk<00:01:03.750> about<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.409> exact<00:01:04.830> steps<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
going to talk about the exact steps you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
hits you want have a nice split step in

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
hits you want have a nice split step in
him<00:01:11.189> it's<00:01:11.310> coming<00:01:11.580> out<00:01:11.700> to<00:01:11.790> your<00:01:11.909> backhand

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.520 
off to the outside right so you push off
the<00:01:17.189> outside<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.270> you<00:01:18.390> start<00:01:18.780> running

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
the outside and then you start running

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:22.070 
the outside and then you start running
right<00:01:19.860> whenever<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> get<00:01:21.060> said<00:01:21.479> it's<00:01:21.869> kind<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
always going to be to the outside

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.830 
always going to be to the outside
getting<00:01:23.820> set<00:01:24.119> that's<00:01:24.330> where<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.600> want<00:01:24.780> to
