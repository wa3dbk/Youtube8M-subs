while<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.760> don't<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.180> it<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.450> but<00:00:39.770> um<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.760> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
while I don't think it is but um like I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.569

teleporting<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.690> clone<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.530> herself<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.250> thought

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
teleporting a clone of herself I thought

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.860

it<00:00:47.610> was<00:00:47.760> a<00:00:47.820> glitch<00:00:48.030> because<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.480> thought<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.719> was

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
it was a glitch because I thought it was

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.590 
it was a glitch because I thought it was
a<00:00:48.930> faux<00:00:49.230> model<00:00:49.739> sick<00:00:50.039> standing<00:00:50.550> here<00:00:50.700> because
