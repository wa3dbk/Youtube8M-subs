Android tablets do have very low
specification<00:00:22.170> but<00:00:22.710> there<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.100> a<00:00:23.130> way<00:00:23.400> you<00:00:23.430> can

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
specification but there is a way you can

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.609 
specification but there is a way you can
optimize<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.420> to<00:00:24.630> make<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.590> run<00:00:25.769> very<00:00:26.250> decently

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
optimize it to make it run very decently

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:30.800 
optimize it to make it run very decently

is checked and we're all good so and
there's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> lot<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.010> other<00:00:53.129> stuff<00:00:53.370> you<00:00:53.399> can

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
there's a lot of other stuff you can

there's a lot of other stuff you can
play<00:00:53.730> around<00:00:53.969> here<00:00:54.239> too<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.870> transitions

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
play around here too the transitions

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.560 
play around here too the transitions
will<00:00:55.739> make<00:00:55.860> your<00:00:55.980> device<00:00:56.070> feel<00:00:56.460> faster<00:00:56.969> if<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
will make your device feel faster if you

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.510 
will make your device feel faster if you
don't<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.079> transitions<00:00:58.770> you<00:00:58.859> can<00:00:58.890> turn<00:00:59.340> them

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
don't like transitions you can turn them

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.819 
don't like transitions you can turn them
off<00:00:59.699> or<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.359> can<00:01:00.510> actually<00:01:00.629> turn<00:01:00.930> them<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.199> 0.5

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
off or you can actually turn them to 0.5

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.010 
off or you can actually turn them to 0.5
and<00:01:03.710> I'll<00:01:04.710> show<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.010> it'll<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.210> make<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
and I'll show you it'll actually make it

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.560 
and I'll show you it'll actually make it
a<00:01:07.200> lot<00:01:07.650> faster<00:01:08.280> well<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.850> make<00:01:09.000> it<00:01:09.119> feel<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> lot

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
a lot faster well to make it feel a lot

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.359 
a lot faster well to make it feel a lot
faster<00:01:09.930> so<00:01:10.049> you<00:01:10.080> can<00:01:10.200> see<00:01:10.409> that<00:01:10.950> was<00:01:11.100> pretty

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
faster so you can see that was pretty

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:11.840 
faster so you can see that was pretty
fast

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
fast

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850 
fast
so<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.450> made<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> device<00:01:12.930> feel<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.530> bit

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
so it made the device feel a bit

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.060 
so it made the device feel a bit
snappier<00:01:15.200> anything<00:01:16.200> else<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.650> developer

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
snappier anything else in developer

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.070 
snappier anything else in developer
options<00:01:17.430> there<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.790> couple<00:01:18.299> other<00:01:18.420> stuff<00:01:18.840> as

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
options there is a couple other stuff as

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.320 
options there is a couple other stuff as
you<00:01:19.619> can<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.430> won't<00:01:20.700> really<00:01:21.030> speed<00:01:21.299> up

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
you can do but it won't really speed up

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.190 
you can do but it won't really speed up
your<00:01:21.479> device<00:01:22.159> so<00:01:23.159> those<00:01:23.400> are<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.700> things<00:01:23.880> I

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
your device so those are the things I

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.940 
your device so those are the things I
recommend<00:01:25.200> in<00:01:25.880> also<00:01:27.110> let's<00:01:28.110> go<00:01:28.200> back<00:01:28.350> in<00:01:28.500> to

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
recommend in also let's go back in to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:30.620 
recommend in also let's go back in to
your<00:01:29.070> developer<00:01:29.490> option<00:01:29.759> also<00:01:30.180> one<00:01:30.420> thing<00:01:30.540> I

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
your developer option also one thing I

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.340 
your developer option also one thing I
wanted<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.460> note<00:01:32.460> too<00:01:32.820> is<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.659> how<00:01:33.900> much<00:01:34.140> it

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
wanted to note too is the how much it

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.249 
wanted to note too is the how much it
can<00:01:34.530> stay<00:01:34.799> how<00:01:35.250> much<00:01:35.720> RAM<00:01:36.720> you're<00:01:37.020> using

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
can stay how much RAM you're using

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.340 
can stay how much RAM you're using
because<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:37.979> thing<00:01:38.159> has<00:01:38.280> 512<00:01:38.909> Rams<00:01:39.150> so<00:01:39.420> don't

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
because this thing has 512 Rams so don't

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.440 
because this thing has 512 Rams so don't
keep<00:01:40.560> activities<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.369> probably<00:01:42.119> recommend

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
keep activities I probably recommend

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.420 
keep activities I probably recommend
that<00:01:42.780> as<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.439> can<00:01:43.560> see<00:01:43.680> don't<00:01:43.979> keep<00:01:44.130> every

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
that as you can see don't keep every

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.450 
that as you can see don't keep every
activity<00:01:44.790> or<00:01:45.630> in<00:01:45.869> a<00:01:45.990> background<00:01:46.409> limit<00:01:46.860> so<00:01:47.430> if

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
activity or in a background limit so if

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.710 
activity or in a background limit so if
you<00:01:47.579> have<00:01:47.670> a<00:01:47.729> background<00:01:47.939> limit<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.450> have<00:01:48.630> it

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
you have a background limit I have it

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300 
you have a background limit I have it
only<00:01:48.869> standard<00:01:49.259> limits<00:01:49.560> so<00:01:49.710> let's<00:01:49.890> say<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.100> want

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
only standard limits so let's say I want

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.030 
only standard limits so let's say I want
to<00:01:50.509> applications<00:01:51.509> running<00:01:51.720> in<00:01:52.040> the

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
to applications running in the

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.590 
to applications running in the
background<00:01:53.280> I've<00:01:54.119> got<00:01:54.299> 3<00:01:55.460> yeah<00:01:56.460> yeah<00:01:56.670> so<00:01:57.540> 2

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
background I've got 3 yeah yeah so 2

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.999 
background I've got 3 yeah yeah so 2
applications<00:01:58.409> running<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> background

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
applications running in the background

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.920 
applications running in the background
so<00:01:59.579> what<00:01:59.729> this<00:01:59.880> would<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.540> won't<00:02:00.719> do<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
so what this would do is it won't do the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.300 
so what this would do is it won't do the
standard<00:02:01.290> lender<00:02:01.530> it'll<00:02:01.740> just<00:02:01.979> run<00:02:02.100> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
standard lender it'll just run to

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.280 
standard lender it'll just run to
applications<00:02:02.880> and<00:02:03.119> that'll<00:02:03.420> save<00:02:03.659> RAM<00:02:04.020> and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
applications and that'll save RAM and

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.170 
applications and that'll save RAM and
make<00:02:04.439> it<00:02:04.590> a<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:05.130> more<00:02:05.159> smoother<00:02:05.759> so<00:02:05.969> yeah

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
make it a bit more smoother so yeah

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.580 
make it a bit more smoother so yeah
it'll<00:02:06.360> kick<00:02:06.659> you<00:02:06.840> out<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.049> you'd<00:02:07.290> have<00:02:07.439> to

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
it'll kick you out and you'd have to

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.040 
it'll kick you out and you'd have to
restart<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.550> applications<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.300> it'll<00:02:09.899> keep

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
restart some applications but it'll keep

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.410 
restart some applications but it'll keep
