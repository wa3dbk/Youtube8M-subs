solavei on my Nexus 4 I actually ordered

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.050 
solavei on my Nexus 4 I actually ordered
solavei<00:00:25.500> solely<00:00:25.980> based<00:00:26.340> on<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.730> reason<00:00:27.029> that

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
solavei solely based on the reason that

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
solavei solely based on the reason that
this<00:00:27.330> phone<00:00:27.510> was<00:00:27.630> ever<00:00:27.900> produced<00:00:28.170> without<00:00:28.560> LTE

into<00:02:29.920> new<00:02:30.220> area

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.900 

let's<00:02:45.260> see<00:02:45.470> how<00:02:45.590> long<00:02:45.770> takes<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.250> lot<00:02:46.400> of<00:02:46.460> a<00:02:46.670> high

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
let's see how long takes a lot of a high

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:54.280 
let's see how long takes a lot of a high
quality<00:02:46.940> youtube<00:02:47.570> video<00:02:52.600> so<00:02:53.600> high<00:02:53.750> quality<00:02:54.200> is

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
quality youtube video so high quality is

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.380 
quality youtube video so high quality is
on<00:02:54.470> and<00:02:54.860> let's<00:02:55.070> start<00:02:55.280> counting<00:02:55.700> star<00:02:56.120> became

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
on and let's start counting star became

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.750 
on and let's start counting star became
so<00:02:56.900> the<00:02:57.080> same<00:02:57.320> thing<00:02:57.560> always<00:02:57.770> happens<00:02:57.950> i<00:02:58.580> can

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
so the same thing always happens i can

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.580 
so the same thing always happens i can
use<00:02:58.850> device<00:02:59.120> launches<00:02:59.600> let's<00:03:00.080> go<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.290> another

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
use device launches let's go to another
