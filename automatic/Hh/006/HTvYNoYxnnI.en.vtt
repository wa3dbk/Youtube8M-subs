00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:42.350
 let's say it allocates a moment to sit down 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.329
 on the synthetic platinum that he was looking at 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.690
 the flight that was ready for took off 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:49.430
 to be able to accommodate clear thanks for 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.170
 host with Giulia our 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.519
 bunny then these animals are 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:55.269
 now they have entered 

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:58.040
 we see our houses with daisy 

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:59.750
 with daisy in our homes like 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.579
 animals from naturally made the rabbit 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.470
 it is an animal from the technical point of view 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:05.960
 but these animals are also meat 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.830
 thanks to particular enters 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.600
 our homes 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.450
 what is your experience can put 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.380
 dario on these rabbits of affection 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.350
 then what is the difficulty 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.390
 greater is understanding how much an animal 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.430
 precisely this considered an animal from 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.590
 meat or any cage can enter 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:25.360
 in homes essentially like a 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.009
 pet so you understand how 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.119
 essentially everyone should be treated 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.119
 the effects as a pet 

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.550
 with controls both from the point of view 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.530
 of vaccination prophylaxis both from the point 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.940
 of view also of the analyzes of the 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.180
 I did because they are animals that can 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.759
 to meet very easily 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.729
 coccidiosis as well as dental malocclusions 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.110
 and therefore it is an animal that must nevertheless 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.860
 be followed from the point of view 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.740
 veterinarian as it is like a cat a 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:56.899
 I read classical china exactly so just 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:01.009
 got a rabbit here generally are 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.619
 they are taken at trade shows or otherwise 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:07.430
 also in specialized shops but they must 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.590
 be promptly checked 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.840
 and at 30 days already begin 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.840
 vaccination prophylaxis also because then 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.269
 they are animals that will stay at home or at home 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.890
 maximum precisely in cages like these or 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.690
 some cases that are generally barely there 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.769
 behavior of these animals that I 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:23.870
 I know but we want to say 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.420
 viewers that is who looks like 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.870
 a little cat or dog 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:32.450
 different features have 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.299
 they look like they are affectionate like 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.030
 like dogs even if they have anyway 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:39.660
 of their needs 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.160
 we smile because there is less to find 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.880
 it requires attention he is also one 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.560
 show 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:51.360
 we want to say something all the 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:53.160
 parrot loves to be pretty 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.930
 vain here from the point of view 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:59.120
 veterinarian can be said that anyway 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.120
 he also requires a lot of attention 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.510
 I like plastic objects 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.310
 Also colored microphones we lira 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.230
 a rano artisan must put the 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.720
 springs that occupy the bed 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.750
 crushing the model on which language 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.570
 watching is because it seems like a seed 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.830
 morally I resemble a seed crisis 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:24.330
 reason very well we ask for andrea if it 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:27.150
 we push another if you don't think but you 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.210
 so thank you for your experience 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:32.850
 we thank our people and my colleagues 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:34.920
 to have come here to have given del 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.110
 flash information but useful though 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.260
 see the veterinarian at 360 degrees 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.820
 in the end no specializations e 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.350
 anything else in every sector though 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.350
 we really need to know that
