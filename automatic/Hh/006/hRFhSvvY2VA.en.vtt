00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:36.329 
really use this I'm going to be honest

with<00:02:36.480> you<00:02:36.599> over<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.650> plug-in<00:02:37.890> just<00:02:38.609> for

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
with you over a plug-in just for

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.240 
with you over a plug-in just for
prefixes<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.810> might<00:02:40.019> want<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.319> use<00:02:40.409> that<00:02:40.470> this

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
prefixes you might want to use that this

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.220 
prefixes you might want to use that this
gives<00:02:41.489> you<00:02:41.609> more<00:02:41.819> control<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.840> if<00:02:42.930> you<00:02:43.049> don't

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
gives you more control but if you don't

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.289 
gives you more control but if you don't
need<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.590> control<00:02:44.010> then<00:02:44.639> just<00:02:44.939> go<00:02:45.060> for<00:02:45.239> a

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
need the control then just go for a

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:46.910 
need the control then just go for a
simpler<00:02:45.629> one<00:02:45.870> because<00:02:46.200> creating<00:02:46.560> quite<00:02:46.859> a

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
simpler one because creating quite a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.940 
simpler one because creating quite a
load<00:02:47.099> of<00:02:47.250> prefixes<00:02:48.349> can<00:02:49.349> be<00:02:49.500> quite<00:02:49.709> annoying

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
load of prefixes can be quite annoying

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.129 
load of prefixes can be quite annoying
unless<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.609> really<00:02:50.849> do<00:02:51.090> want<00:02:51.299> a<00:02:51.480> custom<00:02:51.689> chat

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:52.139 
unless you really do want a custom chat
