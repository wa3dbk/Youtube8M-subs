00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.130
 its creator of info pets tell us sir 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.530
 ruiz where the initiative of 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.809
 create this project for a while 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.170
 for here we were giving shape to this 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.180
 event until this project and the 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.250
 first stage that we say well this 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.710
 consists of what is the interaction of 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.719
 the people giving food to the fish 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.239
 that today are some fish that last 100 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:53.190
 years is something millenary are fish 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.379
 sacred in all the part of asia and 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.620
 well they are able to recognize the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.620
 owners 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 Y 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.710
 we mainly try to get people 

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:17.630
 have the contact but keeping a lot 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.880
 care about the animals can be 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.740
 put the food that the fish takes it from 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.869
 the tip of the fingers of the people 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.299
 but you are not allowed to touch the fish nor 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:29.060
 trying to grab it is also a way 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.340
 of culturing towards people to 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.590
 have a little more respect 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:49.759
 towards the environment and so we go 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:51.679
 forming a better future an experience 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.810
 We had seen them in magazine 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.340
 in documentaries but not if live 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.130
 it seems beautiful that they have placed us 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:01.440
 here in the pond pretty nice 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.210
 the experience I'm not 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.700
 no excellent fish stiles 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.280
 relaxed from experience and first 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.790
 nothing very good 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.790
 Y 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.390
 Y 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.450
 due to the success with these fish coin of the 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.400
 another side to another lagoon of the terraces 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.710
 I'm going to turn it into a pond 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.680
 marine or saltwater to be able 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.410
 have marine species like sharks and 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.210
 sting rays of sea stars and that 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.250
 that way we're going to give you a little bit 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:39.470
 more entertainment than what we 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.910
 like to make our visitors here 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.910
