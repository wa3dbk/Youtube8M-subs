 today we focus on the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.980
 culture in Reims by visiting the museum 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.740
 fine arts which hosts a 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.779
 extraordinary exhibition 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.880
 based on the Champagne and heritage 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.920
 right now we are going 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.809
 find inside to talk about 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.440
 the exhibition the arts of effervescence 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.440
 that jean bart 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.809
 parallel this exhibition on the 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.000
 Champagne 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.489
 we can also you and me 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.359
 defend our heritage and landscape 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.519
 hillsides of champagne 

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.440
 for that it suffices simply to 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:05.140
 fill out this little newsletter to become 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.630
 Ambassador of the candidacy 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.190
 champagne landscapes at unesco 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:11.350
 introduce it here and make it the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.210
 promotion around us we go out david 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.869
 lyon thank you for accepting our 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.330
 invitation 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.740
 so me my first question you who 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:19.539
 are director of the Museum of Fine Arts 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.220
 is also curator of the exhibition 

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.380
 why this exhibition on the 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.800
 champagne either I'm really a subject 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.050
 absolutely 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.690
 the essential thing is one subject at a time that 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.250
 sends us back to our common territory 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.830
 but it's also a national topic 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.090
 Parisian is also a subject 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.250
 international so it's really a 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.720
 subject in gold and then it's a subject 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.760
 does not concern 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.650
 simply a liking to sion but before 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.210
 all the arts the champagne besides 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.800
 himself is an assassin creations 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.200
 extraordinary for viewers 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.090
 who look at us we can say we have 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.740
 here a wonderful catalog that presents 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.470
 we will say the many works 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.600
 presented more than 370 an exhibition 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.680
 really amazing but there 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.420
 which hand that can score at 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.980
 the entrance that the severini painting was 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.090
 this picture because it could 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.830
 give us some details about 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.390
 the arrival of this painting by the way there is 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.470
 a little report on arte tv on his 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.840
 arrival at the Museum of Fine Arts 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.790
 we were very scared to have come 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.490
 it's one of the center's masterpieces 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.690
 Pompidou National Museum of Modern Art 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.459
 it's one of the biggest paintings 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.110
 futuristic is a painting that already 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.580
 had been very important before the big 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.470
 war is a painting all that lives 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.870
 history we do not know well 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.120
 since it will disappear these 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.430
 when we are going to be very unhappy going 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.069
 to be able to paint them through 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.230
 pictures what makes this final painting 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:35.079
 this version is realized in the 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.359
 60s is offered by the sons of his 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:39.760
 derivatives in the center want a table 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:41.680
 for me that is essential in 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.049
 exhibition because we go beyond our 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.519
 posters that we often know 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:48.159
 around the champagne is intel who 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:50.739
 finally recalls that this exhibition 

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.750
 his first title Caesar 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.859
 the effervescence and we can say that this 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.290
 painting is a fashion 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.790
 the effervescence to grind to our colleagues 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.310
 of France devoted television there is little 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.919
 of time a broadcast a report on 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.870
 the role of women in champagne and 

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.819
 we see you in this exhibition 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.199
 a bust of the widow 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.790
 corinne is what you give us 

00:03:08.199 --> 00:03:11.109
 some explanations some details 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.590
 on the involvement of women in 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.639
 Champagne 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:20.169
 I believe in ten years 25 by the way 

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:23.270
 windows of the rifains capabilities of 

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:24.830
 women manage two legs 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.200
 I believe they are played a big 

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:29.840
 role launched alain obviously with 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.550
 lovers since he is the icon with 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.950
 rate that will defend the heritage 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.930
 archaeological history and payment 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:37.910
 who defends the door march and by 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.940
 later in the second half of the seventeenth 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.350
 century ago there was too much want the break that 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.270
 is at the origin of our collections 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.410
 that she played a role quite 

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:49.130
 essential since ali in the basket 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:50.710
 together they will make waves 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:54.230
 essentials that will renew 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:57.380
 the installation of this museum weeks but 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.970
 already at the time was fighting for the 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.640
 building to repel his escape 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:04.580
 david liot we see in one of the rooms 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.840
 of the exhibition the dining room of a 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.130
 What can you give us? 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.880
 some details a little history 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.790
 where his furniture 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:12.560
 so important regarding his furniture he 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.660
 is of his time he will eventually bought 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.610
 design of his time and especially 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.850
 the new art he will discover at 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:22.070
 the World's Fair of 1889 and 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.910
 this is where he will discover pebbles and 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.820
 so what is quite amazing 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.280
 it's finally that it's olive tree 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.990
 is going to drive Wales is genuinely on 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.790
 furniture path and who will he 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.520
 ask for a dining room and this 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:38.150
 dining room is a real 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:42.379
 laboratory to true repertoire of the 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:44.090
 nature champenoise vidic wine is 

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.050
 it's absolutely amazing 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.090
 it's accepting a piece of furniture 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:49.520
 feeling that he is coming out of the ground that his 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:51.259
 roots are those of vines 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:53.389
 and gradually it becomes more and more 

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:55.069
 high more and more fascinating and getting 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.050
 transforms into a constellation 

00:04:55.069 --> 00:05:00.169
 there are also more modern works 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.090
 more contemporary like this work to 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:03.830
 Murano glass base reps 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.030
 chandeliers is really very original 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.490
 because you can give us 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:08.979
 some information already on 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.389
 the artist and on this artwork 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:11.930
 I think that we really have a beautiful 

00:05:11.389 --> 00:05:13.669
 conclusion 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.979
 at the same time this work beyond the glass 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:18.409
 of murano glass it reveals the setting 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:20.150
 in abyss of the aristocratic myth of 

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:24.319
 champagne and that's what's all about 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:27.289
 funny funny is that finally we 

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:30.139
 concludes the exhibition with a set to 

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:33.590
 the dali is a whole table finally 

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:36.169
 both refreshed evening Cutting 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.780
 bottles and a chandelier all that seems 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:42.080
 to liquefy like soft watches from 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:44.960
 salvador dali and I think we have a 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:47.419
 very nice wink over the 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.250
 champagne is pretty fast since three 

00:05:47.419 --> 00:05:51.020
 centuries so I'm really delighted that 

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:52.819
 the house ruinart and well accepted of 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.870
 we lend this work of extreme 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:55.870
 paralyzing agility 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.140
 david liot so for better you 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.580
 to know I have a little game of questions 

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:06.100
 pretty quick answers if you can 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:09.770
 good of which you are rather by new 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.080
 art deco at the same time it does not look 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.390
 consoles again when we pose a 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:16.580
 complex question and as for this 

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:19.910
 hatching is in connection with the dance museum 

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:21.500
 exact rather left victory but I 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:24.280
 am necessarily at the left knee of any 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:26.750
 way we dissect the nausea of ​​orsay 

00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:28.160
 had boasted about having this exhibition 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.270
 talk about champagne and in a lot of 

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:30.670
 personal you are rather champagne 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:37.400
 raw or rosé champagne 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:38.840
 I was rather raw champagne I am and 

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:44.450
 the madam rather tea or coffee 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:46.310
 ho8ot morning here is my letter rather from 

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:52.070
 liters of these distributions and well 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:53.630
 it is after that so ends our 

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:54.170
 visit this exhibition on the 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:56.090
