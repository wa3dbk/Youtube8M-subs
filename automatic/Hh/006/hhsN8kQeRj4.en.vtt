00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
yeah I mean it's very easy I mean if you

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.109 
yeah I mean it's very easy I mean if you
can't<00:00:24.500> score<00:00:25.500> a<00:00:25.710> passing<00:00:26.369> touchdown<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.060> a

can't score a passing touchdown and a

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.509 
can't score a passing touchdown and a
rushing<00:00:27.480> touchdown<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.349> in<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:29.010> same<00:00:29.189> game

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
rushing touchdown and in the same game

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.569 
rushing touchdown and in the same game
you<00:00:29.550> should<00:00:29.820> probably<00:00:30.859> go<00:00:31.859> play<00:00:32.189> a<00:00:32.219> different

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
you should probably go play a different

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.459 
you should probably go play a different
 game<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.329> I<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:37.200> first

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
 game the way I do it the first

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.850 
 game the way I do it the first
1i<00:00:37.770> score<00:00:38.219> is<00:00:38.399> a<00:00:39.079> passing<00:00:40.079> touchdown<00:00:40.530> I<00:00:40.559> think

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
1i score is a passing touchdown I think

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
you get to about usually right around

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.420 
you get to about usually right around
the<00:01:35.369> 20<00:01:35.759> yard<00:01:35.939> line<00:01:36.290> it's<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.770> can't<00:01:38.040> stop

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
the 20 yard line it's they can't stop

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.600 
the 20 yard line it's they can't stop
you<00:01:38.640> know<00:01:39.500> especially<00:01:40.500> if<00:01:41.009> you<00:01:41.130> have<00:01:41.159> a<00:01:41.280> fast

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you know especially if you have a fast

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.539 
you know especially if you have a fast
quarterback<00:01:42.030> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.689> I<00:01:43.820> think<00:01:44.820> they<00:01:45.180> stuff

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
quarterback you know I think they stuff

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.429 
quarterback you know I think they stuff
Barry<00:01:47.549> Sanders<00:01:48.119> here<00:01:48.479> and<00:01:48.659> then<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> next<00:01:49.170> one

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
Barry Sanders here and then the next one

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:49.980 
Barry Sanders here and then the next one
I<00:01:49.500> run

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
I run

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.700

then<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:52.030> probably<00:01:52.689> could<00:01:52.930> have<00:01:52.960> ran<00:01:53.200> that<00:01:53.439> one

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
then I probably could have ran that one

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.690
