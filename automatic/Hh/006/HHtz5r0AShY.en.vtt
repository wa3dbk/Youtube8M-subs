00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi so I actually had a problem 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.000
 at the level of my clutch pedal so 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.290
 on it is a command 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.570
 hydraulic is actually my pedal 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:18.520
 clutch had a very very race 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.170
 low it is almost like that so 

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:22.150
 Well, I just blew 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:26.490
 so to do a purge down I did 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.800
 an arc system 50 which clark 50 is 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.370
 a pressure in a jar that sends 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:36.120
 brake fluid to the jar and it allows 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.120
 to purge 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.440
 so then my system in the end 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:47.440
 it's simple I took a road a 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.210
 road or just for not having too much 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.890
 of pressure so I put pressure on 

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:56.950
 about 1.5 so there I removed the Laval 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.020
 wants the wii the little wave that is 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.360
 in which prevents the air from coming out 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.600
 so this one looks at the lot not a pipe 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.170
 so the pipe that fits so in a 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.740
 bottle 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:11.490
 a bottle of coke is there then the 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.140
 air pipe we see here that appears 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.700
 so the re-entries but in pressure in 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.600
 the bottle 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.590
 they have to have liquid from 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.540
 brakes so here I just made the 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:22.930
 purge so obviously there is almost more 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.659
 of brake fluid and so and a hose 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:27.549
 which goes down to the bottom it is necessary that the 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.799
 pipe absolutely is why in the liquid 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.619
 of brakes so there pressure come in 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.950
 in is going up through the pipe so that 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:42.939
 up the brake fluid up and 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:45.670
 so then I adapted a little one 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.049
 little cap on my jar so there in 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.170
 ultimately the jar it's always 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:53.850
 in pressure with brake fluid 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.049
 who comes in who arrives constantly 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.439
 So now we will see where 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:04.210
 find the purge of the receiver 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:08.789
 clutch so you lie so 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:11.700
 this is the front left wheel 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:20.760
 so we will come to the level of the box 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:25.219
 speed is so there is one 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.219
 scepter so on the receiver 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:37.349
 so here is the receiver there is a 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:40.319
 little clip what to push so 

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.420
 pushed by pressing where then with a 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.159
 little screwdriver behind to pull it 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.109
 a little bit so we do not want to do it 

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.459
 because there I'm going to purge 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.579
 then I would like by master air 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.939
 so in fact there the little clip that we go 

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:58.739
 push it what will allow the pipe 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:03:01.290
 is here to be able to pull it through there so 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.870
 in the end it will open the small 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.720
 purge that's here because it's not 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.510
 a purge with a screw so at the end of 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.430
 account pulling the pipe goes 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.019
 open to the purge is like the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.209
 circuit it is under pressure and well the 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.979
 brake fluid will come out through the 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.159
 purge simply 

00:03:19.979 --> 00:03:24.599
 here and so at the pedal 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:27.120
 clutch 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.040
 Ben she and me the remounts elsewhere 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:31.590
 gone up alone very slowly 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.319
 and so now I have more than I 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:36.359
 more than two races actually the problem 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.370
 what happened was that I had 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.129
 have a brake fluid level too 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:49.379
 weak so we will go and see where 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:52.079
 find the pipe so here's the 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:54.269
 jar he is there and the pipe 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:57.299
 so we 're not going to have a terrible time with 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.510
 sun the pipe here we learn 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:02.300
 see it here here is cooking yola so is 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.920
 ultimately 

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.380
 level of brake fluid was to be 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:09.790
 too low as I was in the mountains with 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:12.879
 down with the turns with 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:14.760
 the ribs actually when I geared that 

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:20.160
 had to take a little air and so sat to 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:24.940
 his grandma's air in the in the 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:27.639
 clutch hydraulic circuit so in 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.039
 done it's on the on this system at 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:34.840
 hydraulic system level 

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:38.020
 this is the first the first organ that 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:41.020
 will get some fresh air 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:44.860
 since their end the 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:47.410
 lala brake hoses will take the air in 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:50.830
 last one so it's because it's 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:52.180
 under the jar so here is a 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:54.389
 simple system to be able to do 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.360
 a purge so obviously we can do 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:05:00.690
 exactly the same thing since there I 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.800
 have taken a lot to purge but 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:07.979
 when I have my brakes so that's it 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.979
 was going to
