00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 hi my name is katerina and today u 

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.340
 us on the comment tenth number more precisely 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.840
 I have 8 but you already have 10 which means 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.840
 that the time has come book gangs 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:20.310
 If someone does not burn in the book gang, I am a member 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 I'm looking for 5 cool guys can credit them 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.570
 channels i take on a bet in the description 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.310
 go look and the whole essence of the book 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.470
 gang is that we choose 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.080
 some topic of the month under this topic 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.120
 we select books we read throughout 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.010
 months these books and at the end of the tenth 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.309
 every month we talk about 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.230
 These books I hope everything is clear and the topic 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.510
 This month has become a book grade too 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:47.610
 The theme of this month was the classic of the genre 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.440
 I thought for a long time what book 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.570
 choose what author at all 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.730
 is a classic of the genre we like 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.680
 I did not discuss a particular genre very much 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.420
 long thought Bradbury Martian 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.489
 Chronicles had a lot of time to take Camilla 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.859
 so I decided to take my adored 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 jane austin probably there is nothing 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.240
 classic jane austin and since i 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.979
 read all 6 basic jane novels 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 Austin and I had a desire to reread 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.210
 any of them in general is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.490
 writer and and the works are great 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.409
 approached the topic of this month I did not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.720
 take a popular topic or even more 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.619
 popular pride and prejudice i 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.150
 decided to reread 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 and tell you about one of ours we 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.560
 jane austin's favorite books she stands 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.270
 I'm in the same row with emma pride and 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.579
 warnings and this work 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.860
 reasoning in my name yet 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.869
 translates hop beliefs but here we have 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.070
 mostly reasoning though probably 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.900
 beliefs still sounds more 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.880
 right in my opinion you are not so 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.680
 Jane Austen's popular novel I don't know 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.420
 why because I love him dearly 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.369
 really like to reread it with me 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.159
 see the same battered copy 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.829
 all the glue on the glue I read it until 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.840
 generally lounging in general need to buy 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.500
 imagine this hardcover book true 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.140
 I want minutes 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.640
 in this translation 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.550
 just like this book because to me 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.410
 really like how it is translated and so 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.710
 This book tells us how it all 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.050
 books about Jane Austen's England of the 19th century about 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.330
 family and litas who live in keel chol 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.459
 and they are quite notable and the family has water 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.770
 father and three daughters their mother long ago 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:16.500
 died already wear very often somebody 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.360
 from parents dies and sir walter elliot 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.130
 he is very proud of his origins and 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.220
 the pedigree of all is very important to him 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.150
 families their nobility all these under the Baron 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.060
 and the baroness 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.800
 In general, all these titles here and he already 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.330
 quite a few years but he go on 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.650
 follow with you and can not stand 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.250
 some human flaws during 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.470
 appearance 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.940
 his eldest daughter forgotten for 29 years 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.820
 so my mother is not she is 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.320
 the main woman in the house is how she is 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.040
 senior and she is not married 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:46.380
 there is also an average n she's 27 years old and she 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.570
 also not married and also we 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.580
 she is younger issued uniqueness having collected 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.680
 and the main character of this book is n and 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.630
 ice father most love older daughter 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.760
 and not forgotten and nothing you spend time and 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.519
 they are with her very much like day u are important too 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.590
 all here are these titles and also external 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.390
 beauty mary all the time whines 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 all the time considers himself the most patient 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.160
 herself miserable she lives with her husband and in 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.230
 general and in general there she lives with him 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.660
 the scenes nobody count nobody in anything 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.670
 doesn't put her just need her name is and she 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.470
 helps 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.440
 but it is not as simple as it seems even she 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.019
 so calm and humbly and patient 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.519
 there would be life one love story she 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.650
 met a young man they 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.959
 fell in love with each other but since he was 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:30.329
 he had no status 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.040
 in general, nothing was her father could not 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.410
 approve this bug and also on it 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:35.610
 was influenced by a friend of her mother who took 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.310
 assume a role like that 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.750
 guardian Lady Russell, and she also I am good 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:41.970
 and on this young man 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.549
 n was only 12 years old and she failed 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.340
 go against their beliefs their arguments and 

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:49.620
 she refused the young man and now 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.590
 Now I have 27 years before the time of the 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.870
 he is by the way probably the only one 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.450
 heroines such an adult ouji and wear 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:59.730
 basically all there are 20 years old plus or minus 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.230
 guy and here once by random 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.569
 by coincidence and again 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.069
 meets this young man of his 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:07.500
 name is captain wentworth 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:10.620
 and he made himself a naval sailor 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.200
 he has a lot of money now he is captain he 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.510
 already has some sort of title that is it 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.430
 in principle well valued in 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.199
 society and in the family of lyutov opposite 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.449
 there was a change for the worse plan 

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:23.639
 financial issue they have to pass 

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:25.620
 your big kellynch hall to bring together 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:28.680
 ends meet in general live more modestly 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.510
 although sir walter and elizabeth cannot live 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.699
 more modest and in general a book to tell us 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.470
 about what they feel and what they experience and 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:36.330
 when she meets with the captain 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.860
 Wentworth there what he feels like 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:40.440
 events unfold in general probably 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:42.960
 that's all you need to know about this book i 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.510
 would say that the very beginning of this 

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.310
 no spoiler and immediately say but how 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.800
 fate and until the captain want for 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.320
 the one with whom they will be with whom they will not 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.030
 You will learn about this by reading this book. 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:56.099
 really madly in love with this work 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:58.169
 jane bones i probably his most 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:00.419
 so I reread the book probably 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:02.610
 in such a miserable state of him 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.060
 I read everything in it 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.250
 work the story itself the plot itself as 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.080
 it's written how the main ones behave 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.610
 the characters there are pretty nasty 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.830
 personality and personality pretty 

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:15.389
 I like how unsympathetic lead 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.280
 myself from even she and together i wouldn't 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.680
 could be so short so 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:20.820
 humble i also like as chief 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.050
 hero captain wentworth 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.210
 I like the work he saw him 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:25.889
 real man he is very cool and 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.900
 so I advise you to read this 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:29.580
 a book if you haven't read it yet 

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:31.199
 like all books jane austin this 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.840
 the works are written the same here 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:36.780
 manner no one anywhere they do not rush for 

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:39.300
 that I love the nineteenth century because 

00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:40.490
 everything goes slowly for them 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:42.770
 by itself 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.479
 undermining things like that 

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:46.460
 nobody runs anywhere nobody rushes 

00:05:44.479 --> 00:05:47.569
 and of course like all jane stories 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.759
 austin this story ends 

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:52.759
 happy ending i love it 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:54.800
 books are writers because sometimes 

00:05:52.759 --> 00:05:56.210
 I don't want everything to be bad 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.430
 that everything was good for some 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.039
 a fairy tale and here in principle we wear 

00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.419
 it always always ends 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:05.180
 weddings flea heroes roughly speaking 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:07.639
 punished good got what they wanted 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:09.979
 overall I love jen austin and advise you 

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:11.990
 to love if they suddenly fell in love 

00:06:09.979 --> 00:06:13.759
 well, and probably that's all I hope is 

00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:15.259
 you enjoyed this video i hope you 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.569
 It was interesting to know what book I am 

00:06:15.259 --> 00:06:18.740
 picked up for a book panda and generally in 

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:21.080
 one opinion about this work 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:22.789
 jane austin also be sure to go 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:24.650
 on the channel and guys and see what 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:26.479
 days they picked those book plans all 

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:28.039
 ssylochki I leave in the description and 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.960

00:06:28.039 --> 00:06:32.240
 Gin autumn I love her so much 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:34.340
 read it specifically the arguments of reason 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.840
 if up to whether you liked me or not 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:37.849
 will know your impressions very closely 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:39.550
 about this book but I say goodbye to it 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:42.550
 I hope you can see you soon
