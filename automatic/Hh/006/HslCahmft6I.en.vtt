00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.089
 We will not negotiate with Silvana 

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:07.350
 the third thing is for real 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.369
 corsa the year 

00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:12.369
 and many artists I want to portray nature 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.289
 but the nature that I had in the house 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:17.929
 a lot of people are not true 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:20.210
 or how it is visited 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:22.710
 with some place he was passing through 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.259
 many artists really portray 

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.810
 and treated 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.989
 the nature around you 

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:30.430
 What brought us not 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:32.170
 we were treated until today 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.620
 about what it was like at that moment 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.650
 the landscape as I want 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.329
 people are here 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.080
 it was the door as much as the 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.910
 different from today 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.110
 all the rooms were to exist today his Friday speech I think 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 we're up to an artist 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.540
 try to solve some artists 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.180
 Let's talk a little 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.560
 of some artists who portray 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.900
 landscapes or things of nature and became famous also for this 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.670
 is the case for example of cloud and monique 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:10.880
 in 1899 I changed painted the famous series of four calls of the unfortunate in his 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.149
 A cute little lakefront property on a small Japanese bridge that inspired the 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:16.520
 series of interests 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.710
 these works when they were exhibited made a great success 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.500
 was a late recognition of a genius of painting 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.030
 mooney in trying to faith relied on the lake and at the tip of his own house 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.280
 in the fall 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.180
 because it was this time of year 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.440
 that the flowers fall on the lake creating a beautiful vision in which moniz oil 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:37.330
 painted 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.620
 the technique of monitors to paint pictures was quite peculiar to people 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.110
 and other artists who listened 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:49.290
 but the technique developed at the time was considered later with 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.840
 one of the most beautiful 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.380
 of the world that is impressive at 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.810
 which appear to be close only to pockets 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.690
 marx when dispensing the vision the picture is formed neatly 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.180
 The captain 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.480
 that also postava of portraying the landscapes taking sides 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.560
 his life was marked by failures he failed 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.170
 in all aspects important to your world in your time 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:21.850
 was able to establish family 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.570
 to pay for their own subsistence or even for social contacts 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:29.510
 at age 37 succumbed to mental illness 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.849
 committing suicide 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.730
 in 1889 at age 36 he came to be hospitalized 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:41.029
 the region of the asylum possessed much corn of wheat wines and olive groves 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.780
 which have become the main source of inspiration for the following four 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.319
 which marked a new style change 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.919
 the small strokes evolved into spiral curves 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.579
 he is going to be 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.789
 only work is centered on the landscapes of religious themes 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:03.799
 combining the ideas of European Expressionism with the feeling of the Baroque of Minas Gerais 

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:07.029
 he's Brazilian 

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:10.819
 speaking to the Brazilian painters we have the famous anita malfati 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:13.459
 listen to the sound a few words 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.189
 salads by herself 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:18.039
 I was 13 

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:19.220
 and suffered 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.559
 because I did not know what course to take in life 

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.559
 nothing and not even reveal myself to the bottom of my sensibility 

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:29.819
 since then this limit the experience teacher 

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:33.449
 Yours must be a descendant of death. 

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.909
 felt the evil strong emotion 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.090
 violently approaching the piri gomes would give the definitive ad- 

00:03:42.089 --> 00:03:43.839
 my personality 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:45.409
 and see I did 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:48.439
 on the sack bag brings nothing polite season 

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.939
 of the deep bar 

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:54.099
 one day leaving the house most tem tementes my girl braids 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.039
 I lay underneath 

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.069
 the sleepers I waited 30 out on top of me 

00:03:59.779 --> 00:04:02.359
 it was an indescribable horrible thing 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:07.389
 the noise in the desert to think of the displacement of air at the 27 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:10.619
 derani in the impression of delirium of madness 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.239
 and I saw things I ran boy registering space 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.390
 colors that I would like to fix 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:19.189
 forever in the haunted retina 

00:04:19.189 --> 00:04:20.539
 was revelation 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:23.539
 I came back determined to dedicate myself to painting 

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:27.430
 anita malfatti 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.220
 was very famous for its beautiful paintings and also painted many 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.260
 landscapes that we can admire according to this figure that you too 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.950
 some artists also mount nature with photo 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:43.659
 like the one you're checking now 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:45.349
 it will be an assembly 

00:04:45.349 --> 00:04:48.539
 editing or editing is a process that consists of selecting 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:52.189
 in order to achieve the desired visual result 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:56.319
