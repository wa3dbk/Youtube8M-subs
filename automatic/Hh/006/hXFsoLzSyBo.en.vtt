we're<00:00:05.060> checking<00:00:05.149> out<00:00:05.330> the<00:00:05.420> fractal<00:00:05.750> define<00:00:05.990> r4

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:06.470 
we're checking out the fractal define r4

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:08.410 
we're checking out the fractal define r4
and<00:00:06.740> this<00:00:06.950> is<00:00:07.069> the<00:00:07.160> black<00:00:07.370> pearl<00:00:07.790> color<00:00:08.090> option

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
and this is the black pearl color option

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.480 
and this is the black pearl color option
sort<00:00:08.690> of<00:00:08.750> a<00:00:08.809> charcoal<00:00:09.200> color<00:00:09.980> looks<00:00:10.280> really

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
sort of a charcoal color looks really

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.830 
sort of a charcoal color looks really
nice<00:00:10.610> got<00:00:10.850> a<00:00:10.879> piano<00:00:11.209> black<00:00:11.299> finish<00:00:11.420> on<00:00:11.750> the

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:11.840 
nice got a piano black finish on the

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.650 
nice got a piano black finish on the
front<00:00:11.870> it<00:00:12.530> is<00:00:12.590> wider<00:00:12.980> than<00:00:13.340> most<00:00:13.580> ATX<00:00:14.299> cases

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:14.660 
front it is wider than most ATX cases

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.170 
front it is wider than most ATX cases
and<00:00:15.019> that<00:00:15.259> allows<00:00:15.530> for<00:00:15.799> maximum<00:00:16.340> airflow<00:00:16.700> and

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:17.180 
and that allows for maximum airflow and

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:18.429 
and that allows for maximum airflow and
that's<00:00:17.330> important<00:00:17.660> because<00:00:17.689> this<00:00:17.990> case<00:00:18.230> is

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
that's important because this case is

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.220 
that's important because this case is
designed<00:00:18.890> for<00:00:19.610> sound<00:00:19.970> dampening<00:00:20.420> yeah<00:00:21.020> when

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
designed for sound dampening yeah when

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.510 
designed for sound dampening yeah when
you<00:00:21.289> open<00:00:21.470> up<00:00:21.560> the<00:00:21.619> door<00:00:21.800> you'll<00:00:22.010> snow<00:00:22.340> tiss

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
you open up the door you'll snow tiss

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.759 
you open up the door you'll snow tiss
sound<00:00:22.970> deadening<00:00:23.269> foam<00:00:23.539> behind<00:00:23.990> the<00:00:24.170> door<00:00:24.380> all

spots for fans that one 140 is already
in<00:00:55.040> there<00:00:55.129> but<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.309> can<00:00:55.430> put<00:00:55.519> two<00:00:55.670> 140<00:00:56.119> s<00:00:56.180> or

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:56.330 
in there but you can put two 140 s or

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.350 
in there but you can put two 140 s or
two<00:00:56.510> 120<00:00:56.989> s<00:00:57.049> in<00:00:57.170> there<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:57.879> there<00:00:58.879> are<00:00:58.909> filters

00:00:59.350 --> 00:00:59.360 
two 120 s in there and there are filters

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.240 
two 120 s in there and there are filters
there<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.690> dust<00:00:59.869> so<00:01:00.619> that's<00:01:00.769> really<00:01:00.890> nice<00:01:01.070> to

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:32.659 
then you have your expansion base now

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:34.810 
then you have your expansion base now

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:04.240 
hard drive screws and then we also have

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.360 
hard drive screws and then we also have
cable<00:06:04.690> ties<00:06:04.870> always<00:06:05.590> gonna<00:06:05.710> have<00:06:05.890> cable<00:06:06.070> ties

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:06.370

you<00:06:06.910> know<00:06:07.000> I<00:06:07.030> think<00:06:07.120> this<00:06:07.270> case<00:06:07.450> actually

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
you know I think this case actually

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.210 
you know I think this case actually
needs<00:06:08.020> something<00:06:08.380> I<00:06:08.500> mean<00:06:08.710> we<00:06:08.830> admit<00:06:09.070> it's

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
needs something I mean we admit it's

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.250 
needs something I mean we admit it's
it's<00:06:09.520> almost<00:06:09.670> perfect<00:06:10.150> but<00:06:10.300> I<00:06:10.480> think<00:06:11.110> it<00:06:11.170> can

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
it's almost perfect but I think it can

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.150 
it's almost perfect but I think it can
be<00:06:11.350> a<00:06:11.380> little<00:06:11.500> bit<00:06:11.620> better<00:06:11.740> what<00:06:11.890> do<00:06:11.950> you<00:06:12.010> think

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:12.160 
be a little bit better what do you think

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.510 
be a little bit better what do you think
it's<00:06:12.280> missing<00:06:12.580> some<00:06:12.730> for<00:06:13.030> air<00:06:13.210> wait<00:06:14.020> a<00:06:14.080> second

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:14.520 
it's missing some for air wait a second

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:18.060 
it's missing some for air wait a second
yes<00:06:15.520> that's<00:06:15.790> much<00:06:15.970> nicer<00:06:16.000> yes<00:06:16.900> we<00:06:17.680> have<00:06:17.860> just

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.070 
yes that's much nicer yes we have just

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:19.830 
yes that's much nicer yes we have just
added<00:06:18.220> many<00:06:18.610> megahertz<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.360> this<00:06:19.480> thing<00:06:19.720> I

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:19.840 
added many megahertz to this thing I

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:21.300 
added many megahertz to this thing I
know<00:06:19.960> it's<00:06:20.110> not<00:06:20.200> twice<00:06:20.470> as<00:06:20.680> fast<00:06:20.920> because<00:06:21.190> that

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
know it's not twice as fast because that

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.100 
know it's not twice as fast because that
logo<00:06:21.610> now<00:06:22.480> this<00:06:22.600> is<00:06:22.690> the<00:06:22.750> case<00:06:22.870> that<00:06:23.020> we're

gonna be using for Max's an editing rig
we<00:06:25.090> picked<00:06:25.300> this<00:06:25.420> case<00:06:25.630> and<00:06:26.070> it's<00:06:27.070> just<00:06:27.340> as
