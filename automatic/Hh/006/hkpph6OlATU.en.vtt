00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.580
 we go 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.769
 my makeup admiration started already ago 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.599
 several years and it was for youtube I've 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.090
 told other times that I started to see 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.649
 tutorials and then it takes the taste and 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.010
 I wanted to start doing this kind of 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.010
 videos 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.450
 but this particular video new a 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.450
 tutorial 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:48.110
 today I'm not going to teach you how to 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.930
 blur shadows or how to create a smoky 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:52.810
 eyes 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.270
 today I want to ask you how they see 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.870
 you makeup 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.450
 how do you want to go out to the world as you want 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.490
 is to show you 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.980
 you think that the amount of makeup 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.980
 what you apply influences how you are 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.150
 I see it like this in this way 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.750
 the makeup is like a way of 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.280
 expression that highlights our 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.770
 personality 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.410
 Beauty is how you feel with you 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.260
 same new the reflection of what you see 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.360
 When you look in the mirror 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.100
 qualities of a person have nothing 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.640
 what to do with the amount of makeup 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.860
 what apply 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.960
 a person with washed face does not stop 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.790
 be beautiful and a person with a lot 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.790
 makeup does not mean that it is 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.119
 the surrounded and many comments on the 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.270
 video powers make up the lines inc and 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.420
 tutorial and criticizing the use of 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.130
 makeup and even own women 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.960
 trying to fake others just for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.320
 make use of something as beautiful as 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.320
 makeup 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.250
 prejudice is what we 're full of 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.970
 when we stop thinking about that one 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.849
 person who puts on makeup is false hollow 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.450
 shallow believe me the world will be 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.450
 more or less 

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.680
 yes no 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:40.120
 because at the end of the day when you 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.450
 maquilles you will remain the same 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.450
 person
