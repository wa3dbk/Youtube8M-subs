producing more food globally and that's
a<00:03:57.489> long-term<00:03:58.030> scenario<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.660> mean<00:03:58.810> this<00:03:58.900> is

00:03:59.039 --> 00:03:59.049 
a long-term scenario I mean this is

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:02.190 
a long-term scenario I mean this is
long-term<00:03:59.590> thinking<00:04:00.510> not<00:04:01.510> everyone<00:04:01.900> agrees

with that perspective ahead a lot iya is

taking away their land I think the

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.569 
taking away their land I think the
simple<00:04:16.570> fact<00:04:16.840> is<00:04:16.989> that<00:04:17.049> if<00:04:17.979> there<00:04:18.280> is<00:04:18.400> no

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
simple fact is that if there is no

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:20.070 
simple fact is that if there is no
investment<00:04:18.909> in<00:04:19.239> these<00:04:19.390> countries<00:04:19.690> these

investment in these countries these

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.980 
investment in these countries these
countries<00:04:20.470> would<00:04:20.590> suffer<00:04:21.010> from<00:04:21.570> low<00:04:22.570> supply

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
it all depends on the approach it all

company you're talking about we in Qatar
we<00:05:10.900> took<00:05:11.080> the<00:05:11.259> approach<00:05:11.349> that<00:05:11.590> we<00:05:12.099> will<00:05:12.400> work

00:05:12.809 --> 00:05:12.819 
we took the approach that we will work

00:05:12.819 --> 00:05:14.939 
we took the approach that we will work
with<00:05:13.120> local<00:05:13.150> farmers<00:05:13.539> we<00:05:14.110> will<00:05:14.349> work<00:05:14.650> with

with local farmers we will work with

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:17.309 
with local farmers we will work with
local<00:05:14.979> communities<00:05:15.729> in<00:05:16.330> fact<00:05:16.659> it<00:05:16.810> cannot<00:05:17.050> just

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:17.319 
local communities in fact it cannot just

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:20.640 
local communities in fact it cannot just
