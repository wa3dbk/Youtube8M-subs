the race sebastian vettel did end up

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.850 
the race sebastian vettel did end up
getting<00:02:15.330> the<00:02:15.600> win<00:02:15.870> this<00:02:16.050> race<00:02:16.260> was<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.650> over

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
getting the win this race was just over

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:19.370 
getting the win this race was just over
two<00:02:17.070> hours<00:02:17.100> long<00:02:17.790> but<00:02:18.450> he<00:02:18.720> did<00:02:18.960> get<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.230> win

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
two hours long but he did get the win

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.800 
two hours long but he did get the win
over<00:02:19.620> jenson<00:02:20.250> button<00:02:20.640> in<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.060> second<00:02:21.450> place<00:02:21.570> I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
over jenson button in the second place I

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:22.730 
over jenson button in the second place I
think<00:02:21.840> for<00:02:22.110> the<00:02:22.170> last<00:02:22.320> couple<00:02:22.500> of<00:02:22.680> years

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
think for the last couple of years

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.100 
think for the last couple of years
Sebastian<00:02:23.370> Vettel<00:02:23.640> as<00:02:23.760> one<00:02:23.970> and<00:02:24.390> second<00:02:24.930> place

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
Sebastian Vettel as one and second place

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.290 
Sebastian Vettel as one and second place

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
has been Jenson Button fernando alonso

has been Jenson Button fernando alonso
has<00:02:27.630> always<00:02:28.080> gone<00:02:28.290> well<00:02:28.590> in<00:02:28.860> singapore<00:02:29.550> he

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
has always gone well in singapore he

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.160 
has always gone well in singapore he
might<00:02:29.880> not<00:02:30.000> had<00:02:30.150> the<00:02:30.300> car<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.690> year<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:31.020> go

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
might not had the car this year to go

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.230 
might not had the car this year to go
for<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.380> win<00:02:31.620> but<00:02:31.860> he<00:02:32.220> could<00:02:32.400> most<00:02:32.640> likely<00:02:32.730> get

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
for the win but he could most likely get

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.390 
for the win but he could most likely get
up<00:02:33.390> there<00:02:33.660> and<00:02:33.780> challenge<00:02:34.470> some<00:02:34.800> good<00:02:35.010> points

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
up there and challenge some good points

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.460 
up there and challenge some good points
once<00:02:35.610> again<00:02:35.940> and<00:02:36.120> maybe<00:02:36.330> a<00:02:36.630> podium<00:02:37.260> is

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
once again and maybe a podium is

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.810 
once again and maybe a podium is
probably<00:02:37.770> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.070> cards<00:02:38.400> for<00:02:38.520> him<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.760> year

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
probably on the cards for him this year

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.180 
probably on the cards for him this year
but<00:02:39.420> we<00:02:39.540> were<00:02:39.690> Fernando<00:02:40.260> Alonso<00:02:40.650> who<00:02:40.800> can<00:02:40.950> pull

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
but we were Fernando Alonso who can pull

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.950 
but we were Fernando Alonso who can pull
out<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> result<00:02:41.730> out<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.000> bag<00:02:42.180> even<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.660> the<00:02:42.780> car

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 
out a result out the bag even if the car

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.110 
out a result out the bag even if the car
isn't<00:02:43.230> that<00:02:43.590> great<00:02:43.890> so<00:02:44.130> I<00:02:44.160> expect<00:02:44.760> him<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.090> be

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
isn't that great so I expect him to be

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.660 
isn't that great so I expect him to be
up<00:02:45.330> there<00:02:45.360> challenging<00:02:45.600> for<00:02:46.440> a<00:02:46.470> podium<00:02:46.860> last

the<00:03:13.500> season<00:03:13.590> with<00:03:14.040> 40<00:03:14.520> indira<00:03:14.820> sort<00:03:15.000> of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
the season with 40 indira sort of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.550 
the season with 40 indira sort of
struggling<00:03:15.510> with<00:03:15.660> development<00:03:16.200> and<00:03:16.320> the

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
struggling with development and the

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.400 
struggling with development and the
tires<00:03:16.800> and<00:03:17.190> I<00:03:18.060> don't<00:03:18.300> think<00:03:18.540> 40<00:03:18.840> India<00:03:19.050> can<00:03:19.290> be

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
tires and I don't think 40 India can be

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.170 
tires and I don't think 40 India can be
up<00:03:19.560> there<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:19.980> i<00:03:20.010> do<00:03:20.130> think<00:03:20.280> Adria<00:03:20.880> suit<00:03:21.060> i

india-mercedes<00:04:04.200> which<00:04:04.890> last<00:04:05.160> year<00:04:05.520> wasn't

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:06.240 
india-mercedes which last year wasn't

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.210 
india-mercedes which last year wasn't
too<00:04:06.660> much<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.930> a<00:04:07.140> common<00:04:07.470> sight<00:04:07.650> Mercedes

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
too much of a common sight Mercedes

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.030 
too much of a common sight Mercedes
wasn't<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.880> strongest<00:04:09.120> car<00:04:09.540> last<00:04:09.780> year

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
wasn't the strongest car last year

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.680 
wasn't the strongest car last year
barbarously<00:04:11.040> did<00:04:11.310> bag<00:04:11.610> a<00:04:11.640> win<00:04:11.970> but<00:04:12.300> it<00:04:12.330> wasn't

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
barbarously did bag a win but it wasn't

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:14.570 
barbarously did bag a win but it wasn't
really<00:04:12.720> nice<00:04:13.110> consistent<00:04:13.740> car<00:04:13.950> over<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.310> year

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
really nice consistent car over the year

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.550 
really nice consistent car over the year
and<00:04:15.180> I<00:04:15.240> think<00:04:15.450> we<00:04:15.570> are<00:04:15.660> saying<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.020> this<00:04:16.260> year

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
and I think we are saying that this year

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.650 
and I think we are saying that this year
I<00:04:16.590> think<00:04:16.680> we<00:04:16.920> can<00:04:17.070> start<00:04:17.520> to<00:04:17.730> see<00:04:17.760> the<00:04:18.120> Mercedes

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
I think we can start to see the Mercedes

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.110 
I think we can start to see the Mercedes
sort<00:04:19.560> of<00:04:19.799> dropping<00:04:20.280> off<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.430> little<00:04:20.640> bit<00:04:20.910> I'm

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
sort of dropping off a little bit I'm

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:22.760 
sort of dropping off a little bit I'm
not<00:04:21.570> a<00:04:21.630> hundred<00:04:21.780> percent<00:04:22.020> sure<00:04:22.229> that's<00:04:22.590> down

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:22.770 
not a hundred percent sure that's down

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:25.070 
not a hundred percent sure that's down
to<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.010> circuits<00:04:23.490> were<00:04:23.640> going<00:04:23.940> to<00:04:24.120> or<00:04:24.510> what<00:04:24.900> by

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
to the circuits were going to or what by

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.200 
to the circuits were going to or what by
not<00:04:25.440> I<00:04:25.740> don't<00:04:26.070> think<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.820> there

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
not I don't think that there

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.240 
not I don't think that there
current<00:04:27.870> Mercedes<00:04:28.319> we<00:04:28.410> see<00:04:28.590> now<00:04:28.740> has<00:04:28.949> the<00:04:29.069> same

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
current Mercedes we see now has the same

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.600 
current Mercedes we see now has the same
sort<00:04:29.460> of<00:04:29.490> pace<00:04:29.729> we<00:04:29.940> saw<00:04:30.120> in<00:04:30.479> Hungary<00:04:31.199> and<00:04:31.610> when

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
sort of pace we saw in Hungary and when

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.010 
sort of pace we saw in Hungary and when
obviously<00:04:32.729> Lewis<00:04:33.120> Hamilton<00:04:33.479> got<00:04:33.630> his<00:04:33.780> well<00:04:33.960> I

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
obviously Lewis Hamilton got his well I

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.090 
obviously Lewis Hamilton got his well I
think<00:04:34.080> it's<00:04:34.319> dropped<00:04:34.560> off<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.800> little<00:04:34.919> bit

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
think it's dropped off a little bit

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:36.650 
think it's dropped off a little bit
since<00:04:35.400> then<00:04:35.610> let<00:04:36.150> me<00:04:36.240> know<00:04:36.330> what<00:04:36.449> you<00:04:36.509> think

Caterham and obviously his team mate
Charles<00:05:05.880> peak<00:05:06.150> so<00:05:06.360> this<00:05:06.509> could<00:05:06.690> be<00:05:06.810> a<00:05:06.840> race

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
Charles peak so this could be a race

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.770 
Charles peak so this could be a race
where<00:05:07.530> we<00:05:07.740> see<00:05:07.919> a<00:05:07.949> lot<00:05:08.310> of<00:05:08.520> drama<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.270> lot<00:05:09.479> of

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:09.780 
where we see a lot of drama a lot of

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:11.930 
where we see a lot of drama a lot of
accidents<00:05:10.229> last<00:05:10.590> year<00:05:10.949> we<00:05:11.430> saw<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.639> lot<00:05:11.729> of

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
accidents last year we saw a lot of

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.930 
accidents last year we saw a lot of
people<00:05:12.479> fooled<00:05:12.840> out<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.139> the<00:05:13.259> race<00:05:13.490> only<00:05:14.490> 16

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
people fooled out to the race only 16

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:16.580 
people fooled out to the race only 16
cars<00:05:15.240> on<00:05:15.449> the<00:05:15.539> lead<00:05:15.690> lap<00:05:15.750> last<00:05:16.169> year<00:05:16.440> so<00:05:16.560> I

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:16.590 
cars on the lead lap last year so I

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.189 
cars on the lead lap last year so I
suppose<00:05:16.770> that's<00:05:16.919> not<00:05:17.099> too<00:05:17.340> bad<00:05:17.370> but<00:05:17.669> I<00:05:18.270> think

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
suppose that's not too bad but I think

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:20.719 
suppose that's not too bad but I think
about<00:05:19.380> good<00:05:19.590> five<00:05:19.770> or<00:05:19.800> six<00:05:20.159> people<00:05:20.340> ended<00:05:20.669> up

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
about good five or six people ended up

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.730 
about good five or six people ended up
retiring<00:05:21.150> from<00:05:21.539> the<00:05:21.720> race<00:05:21.870> last<00:05:22.199> year<00:05:22.409> and

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
retiring from the race last year and

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:24.649 
retiring from the race last year and
which<00:05:23.520> is<00:05:23.639> never<00:05:23.789> nice<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.030> see<00:05:24.330> I<00:05:24.360> mean<00:05:24.509> you

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:24.659 
which is never nice to see I mean you

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:25.939 
which is never nice to see I mean you
always<00:05:24.810> want<00:05:24.990> to<00:05:25.050> see<00:05:25.169> all<00:05:25.319> the<00:05:25.440> cars<00:05:25.620> come<00:05:25.860> to

00:05:25.939 --> 00:05:25.949 
always want to see all the cars come to

00:05:25.949 --> 00:05:28.040 
always want to see all the cars come to
the<00:05:26.039> finish<00:05:26.310> but<00:05:26.580> last<00:05:27.180> year<00:05:27.419> we<00:05:27.509> saw<00:05:27.539> Hamilton

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 
the finish but last year we saw Hamilton

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:31.550 
the finish but last year we saw Hamilton
cart<00:05:28.650> care<00:05:28.979> Maldonado<00:05:29.729> and<00:05:30.150> Vern<00:05:30.930> Schumacher

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:31.560 
cart care Maldonado and Vern Schumacher

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.830 
cart care Maldonado and Vern Schumacher
and<00:05:31.919> also<00:05:32.490> sin<00:05:32.789> and<00:05:32.970> not<00:05:33.090> getting<00:05:33.389> to<00:05:33.509> the<00:05:33.599> flag

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
and also sin and not getting to the flag

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.420 
and also sin and not getting to the flag
which<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.199> a<00:05:34.229> bit<00:05:34.440> disappointing<00:05:35.159> and

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
which is a bit disappointing and

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:36.860 
which is a bit disappointing and
hopefully<00:05:36.060> this<00:05:36.210> year<00:05:36.389> we<00:05:36.509> get<00:05:36.630> to<00:05:36.720> see

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870 
hopefully this year we get to see

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:38.629 
hopefully this year we get to see
everyone<00:05:36.900> comes<00:05:37.349> to<00:05:37.500> flag<00:05:37.740> but<00:05:38.009> obviously

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:38.639 
everyone comes to flag but obviously

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:41.570 
everyone comes to flag but obviously
this<00:05:39.150> is<00:05:39.389> a<00:05:39.599> straight<00:05:40.409> track<00:05:40.740> so<00:05:41.009> obviously<00:05:41.370> we

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
this is a straight track so obviously we

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.089 
this is a straight track so obviously we
know<00:05:41.759> that<00:05:42.449> accident<00:05:43.139> can<00:05:43.440> happen<00:05:43.500> especially

00:05:44.089 --> 00:05:44.099 
know that accident can happen especially

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:47.300 
know that accident can happen especially
in<00:05:44.699> Formula<00:05:45.120> One<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.650> obviously<00:05:46.650> hopefully

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
in Formula One and obviously hopefully

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.370 
in Formula One and obviously hopefully
we<00:05:47.430> won't<00:05:47.550> see<00:05:47.669> any<00:05:47.909> accidents<00:05:48.389> but<00:05:48.599> it<00:05:49.110> might

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
we won't see any accidents but it might

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.050 
we won't see any accidents but it might
be<00:05:49.560> quite<00:05:49.770> likely<00:05:50.039> as<00:05:50.310> we<00:05:50.490> are<00:05:50.580> getting<00:05:50.759> so

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
be quite likely as we are getting so

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.360 
be quite likely as we are getting so
close<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.389> the<00:05:51.630> wall<00:05:51.840> here<00:05:52.440> in<00:05:52.590> Singapore<00:05:53.159> but

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
close to the wall here in Singapore but

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:54.620 
close to the wall here in Singapore but
