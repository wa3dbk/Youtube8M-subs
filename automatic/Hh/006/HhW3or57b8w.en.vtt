 do not 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.059
 do not 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:11.059
 oaxaca welcome mr 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:15.019
 to be happy I think it's fundamental 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.720
 in the center of yourself 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.539
 from your mind, your actions, kristen your principles 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.779
 the principles are the core of their existence 

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.449
 what principles today even 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.740
 what are the principles 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.240
 the principles are innate characteristics to any human being 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.470
 we do not choose them 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.980
 we are born and grow with them are within us 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.500
 both a good man and a criminal are able to feel in a moment 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.850
 determined 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 with passion 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:04.370
 socialist fidelity 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:07.370
 honesty 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.560
 these are the principles 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.950
 we all have them 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.710
 we all have a 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.810
 nahuel born that tells us what is right and what is wrong in some way 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.640
 we all understand that 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.030
 helping another is good because causing unnecessary harm ism is bad 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.600
 of course all these lopo value judgments are confused 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.780
 with no doctrine or in all that as a result of simply different 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.630
 cultural forms of press 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 but in principle 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:44.000
 we all have 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.130
 a sirte 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.750
 implemented within us 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 that tells us 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.680
 who judges us 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.850
 and to be happy there is no turning of the page 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.729
 you have to live affecting 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.729
 its principles respecting a judge 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.510
 accepting that yourself 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.510
 that above all 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.929
 What is it 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.319
 that other everything 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.449
 all the other important areas in my life 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:19.969
 because there are not too many to know that it is he who is important to you 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:23.209
 love 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.429
 friendship 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:29.229
 the relationship of a couple, family, money or work 

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:31.569
 the power 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.069
 which can include 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.059
 fame or recognition 

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:36.999
 sensory pleasure 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:39.999
 no religion or spirituality 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:45.519
 the creativity 

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:49.399
 some safe area that she left me but she decides 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:53.479
 that this already includes all levels 

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:56.479
 We are all different 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.569
 but we are all moved 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.830
 for these areas 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.830
 they are the engines of our existence 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:10.679
 for one of its three areas are important for others are its four 

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:13.069
 important areas 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.069
 look well inside yourself 

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:21.249
 look carefully inside the people around you rows that you have always said 

00:03:21.249 --> 00:03:23.129
 An area 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.989
 that predominates over the others is the rudder the oar 

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:30.879
 of the assistance of each 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.269
 of course to achieve a 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:39.769
 emotional stability 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:42.769
 the three four five areas that are important in your life 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.619
 they have to be balanced in a harmonic way 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:53.180
 but if we talk about happiness, what I am saying is simple, I am 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.180
 saying that the task that predominates in your life 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.139
 that if you observe yourself Benasque is different 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:02.859
 as your life goes on at the beginning it can be 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:05.419
 then friendship then love it 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:06.499
 then 

00:04:06.499 --> 00:04:09.499
 work money then family health 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:16.119
 the most important area always to be fully happy 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.930
 there must be principles can not be other 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:23.219
 because none of the other areas 

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:25.620
 guarantees happiness 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 all depend on external factors 

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:31.059
 the principles 

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:33.740
 you are yourself one hundred percent 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.729
 your principles are 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.729
 they have to be the starting point and the end point 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.780
 because when the world comes to you down that abc comes 

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:49.430
 maybe the only thing that comes out of it 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:52.430
 are your principles a calm conscience 

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.630
 and if we talk about happiness is that it can not be otherwise you can not live 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.469
 against your principles 

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:02.680
 as simple as those 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.039
 And that is all for now 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:06.560
 safe to listen to me 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:07.659
 is next 

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:09.229
