00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.980
 good morning today we want to present you a 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.040
 home elevator cat 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:15.160
 transformed from a car spending 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.160
 lift bikes that are finished 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.539
 as you can see now let's try to 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:24.890
 see how they work and how to lift the 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.529
 bike 'we are 233 kilos so what 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.910
 let's talk about my partner will record 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.910
 and I'm going to go to work 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.250
 we put it under the engine 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:45.290
 of weight 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.290
 lift it a little 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.190
 sometimes 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.650
 I have already eaten 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.440
 as you can see it is already raising the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.400
 floor almost almost 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:17.400
 you see a lot 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:23.150
 these cats lift up a car like 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.590
 are designed for the car there will be no 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.240
 no problem to lift a motorcycle 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 then we have space here for 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.450
 remove the front wheel the rear one 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.070
 as well 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.510
 and what you want 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.320
 Well this is the cat here 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:42.470
 to make it look closer 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.340
 as it is placed there below the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.340
 motor protector 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.050
 here we have the cat the kind of expense 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.500
 for cars 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.810
 I put her arms here plus her arm that 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:00.060
 comes original from the car and then others 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:04.760
 Two arms and support 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:07.790
 an angular profile and you're 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.690
 I hope you liked this brightness and 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:10.690
 may this be useful
