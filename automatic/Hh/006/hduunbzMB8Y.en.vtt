we'll take just the first three chords
for<00:01:14.609> instance<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.810> chord<00:01:16.140> E<00:01:16.350> major<00:01:16.710> so<00:01:17.460> all<00:01:17.640> I

did was I took the root the fifth and
the<00:01:20.490> third<00:01:20.759> it<00:01:21.000> sounds<00:01:21.420> something<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.719> this

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:31.930 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.080 

I<00:01:31.990> did<00:01:32.680> another<00:01:32.890> inversion<00:01:33.490> of<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.730> bee<00:01:33.880> with

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
I did another inversion of the bee with

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.520 
I did another inversion of the bee with
some<00:01:34.360> added<00:01:34.510> extension<00:01:35.080> so<00:01:35.200> let<00:01:35.320> me<00:01:35.380> show<00:01:35.500> you

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
some added extension so let me show you

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:51.630 
some added extension so let me show you
what<00:01:35.650> that<00:01:35.680> is<00:01:42.330> next<00:01:43.330> course<00:01:43.690> to<00:01:43.840> sharp<00:01:44.080> minor

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.940 

and<00:01:52.540> I<00:01:52.630> outlined<00:01:53.320> just<00:01:53.500> the<00:01:53.590> rest<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
and I outlined just the rest of the

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.500 
and I outlined just the rest of the
chords<00:01:54.220> just<00:01:54.340> like<00:01:54.520> that<00:01:54.730> so<00:01:54.940> this<00:01:55.090> next<00:01:55.270> chord

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
chords just like that so this next chord

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:00.210 
chords just like that so this next chord
e<00:01:55.690> with<00:01:56.170> the<00:01:56.290> G<00:01:56.500> sharp<00:01:58.560> have<00:01:59.560> nice<00:01:59.740> inversion

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
e with the G sharp have nice inversion

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:15.310 
e with the G sharp have nice inversion
shape<00:02:00.430> here<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.480> root

so<00:02:18.880> it's<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.180> very<00:02:19.510> simple<00:02:19.930> formula<00:02:20.410> just<00:02:20.740> take

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
so it's a very simple formula just take

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.210 
so it's a very simple formula just take
the<00:02:21.400> cords<00:02:21.850> take<00:02:22.630> the<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:23.440> core<00:02:23.680> tones<00:02:23.950> the

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
the cords take the the core tones the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.070 
the cords take the the core tones the
the<00:02:24.700> root<00:02:24.910> the<00:02:25.090> fifth<00:02:25.300> and<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.540> third<00:02:25.840> and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
the root the fifth and the third and

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.290 
the root the fifth and the third and
just<00:02:26.680> spread<00:02:27.070> them<00:02:27.160> out<00:02:27.250> over<00:02:27.310> the<00:02:27.640> neck<00:02:27.820> so

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
just spread them out over the neck so

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.300 
just spread them out over the neck so
let's<00:02:28.480> try<00:02:28.660> this<00:02:28.720> together<00:02:29.320> here<00:02:29.830> let<00:02:30.220> me

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
let's try this together here let me

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.400 
let's try this together here let me
count<00:02:30.460> this<00:02:30.610> down<00:02:30.790> for<00:02:31.060> you<00:02:31.260> one<00:02:32.280> two<00:02:33.280> three
