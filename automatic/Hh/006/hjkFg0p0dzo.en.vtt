00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.220
 Ozone is an element that appears in the 

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:28.599
 nature thanks to electric discharges 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.599
 that occur in the atmosphere 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.360
 each oxygen molecule reaction is 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.280
 break and regroup with an atom 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.190
 extra to form ozone 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.040
 this third atom is very unstable and 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.870
 tends to break rapidly by reacting and 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.870
 oxidizing molecules around you 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.929
 bacteria and organic molecules in general 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.699
 extremely sensitive to oxygen 

00:00:52.929 --> 00:00:57.370
 free 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:59.620
 therefore this oxidizing principle 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.320
 similar to that of hydrogen peroxide 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.080
 we use to clean wounds makes 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.440
 Ozone is a potent full eliminator 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.440
 of bacteria 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.200
 the hospital of the clinics of são paulo 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:18.620
 today announced a discovery that promises 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.790
 destroy a necroscopic enemy 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.860
 powerful 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.770
 the scientists found a way to 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.780
 against the kpc superbug 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.970
 resulted in the death of 18 people in 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.830
 Brasilia this year doctors know of 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.870
 ozone has been killing bacteria since the 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.130
 past century is a treatment used in 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.960
 many countries 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.670
 now the hospital of the clinics of são 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.280
 Paulo investigated whether this technique 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.960
 also works with super bacteria 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.210
 that antibiotics do not 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.040
 destroy and cause deaths 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.380
 for hospital infection 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.229
 the result of this search can save 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.660
 of these bacteria were tested on the 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.850
 The samples divided into three groups 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.510
 first been exposed to ozone for five 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.540
 minutes 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.040
 according to oxygen the third group does not 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.870
 had no treatment 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.540
 the next day the bacteria had 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:08.209
 multiplied in the last two glasses in 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.420
 which was treated with ozone no signal 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.640
 The last test was done with the kpc that 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.410
 earned the nickname of superbugia by 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.150
 have been shown to be immune to antibiotics 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.180
 more powerful 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.220
 the sample that received ozone was also 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.530
 clean survey coordinator explains 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.810
 that ozone molecules corrode the 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:28.730
 bacterial outer wall and they are 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.700
 quickly destroyed 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.230
 the gas can be used on the skin or injected 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.150
 in the patient's body 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.310
 the next stage of the study will investigate 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.709
 Ozone vaporization in the environment 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.890
 a surgical center or a uti 

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:46.010
 example also eliminates bacteria 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:49.489
 Optimally it 's very cheap and you use air 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.800
 environment as a raw material then 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.870
 spent can completely modify the 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.780
 control scenario of bacteria 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:59.239
 in a simple way from a 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:02.230
 inexpensive and affordable way in any 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.230
 capital of the country 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.360
 there are no 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.660
 Israelis and Palestinians exchange and not
