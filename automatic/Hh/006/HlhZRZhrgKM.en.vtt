00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
three generators and we're headed back

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.520 
three generators and we're headed back
to<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.940> third<00:00:12.300> one

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:15.530

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
there's not really a puzzle to get it so

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.630 
there's not really a puzzle to get it so
I'm<00:00:32.850> gonna<00:00:32.940> try<00:00:33.150> to<00:00:33.180> get<00:00:33.360> back<00:00:33.570> there<00:00:34.640> without

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
I'm gonna try to get back there without

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.940 
I'm gonna try to get back there without
walking<00:00:36.330> through<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.100> sinks<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:39.770> just<00:00:40.770> cuz

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
walking through the sinks and just cuz

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:48.340 
walking through the sinks and just cuz
it's<00:00:41.130> easier<00:00:44.180> little<00:00:45.180> butterfly

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.430

now those butterflies will mean

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.470 
now those butterflies will mean
something<00:00:52.920> later<00:00:53.130> on<00:00:53.220> in<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.640> game<00:00:56.390> if<00:00:57.390> you

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
something later on in the game if you

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.210 
something later on in the game if you
see<00:00:57.630> three<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.960> them<00:00:58.140> flying<00:00:58.560> around<00:00:58.890> it<00:00:59.130> means

00:02:54.089 --> 00:02:54.099 
alright now if I hit the time crystal

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:56.920 
alright now if I hit the time crystal
damn<00:02:55.099> relic<00:02:55.519> should<00:02:55.700> still<00:02:56.090> be<00:02:56.360> there<00:02:56.569> because

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
damn relic should still be there because

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.119 
damn relic should still be there because
it's<00:02:57.080> before<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.530> took<00:02:57.739> it

00:02:58.119 --> 00:02:58.129 
it's before I took it

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.640 
it's before I took it
right

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:10.300 

but<00:03:02.250> it's<00:03:02.489> not<00:03:05.930> they've<00:03:06.930> broken<00:03:07.290> time<00:03:07.680> law

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.520 

yeah<00:03:10.880> should<00:03:11.569> reappear<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.170> that<00:03:12.319> hole

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
yeah should reappear in that hole

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:18.280 
yeah should reappear in that hole
because<00:03:13.370> I<00:03:13.550> haven't<00:03:13.760> taken<00:03:14.000> it<00:03:14.240> hit<00:03:16.900> and<00:03:17.900> those

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.600 
because I haven't taken it hit and those
doors<00:03:18.530> should<00:03:18.800> actually<00:03:18.980> close<00:03:19.250> themselves

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:19.610 
doors should actually close themselves

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.970 
doors should actually close themselves
as<00:03:20.090> well<00:03:20.270> but<00:03:21.170> oh<00:03:22.810> well<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.080> just<00:03:24.260> I<00:03:24.560> guess

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
as well but oh well I just I guess

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:29.229 
as well but oh well I just I guess
they're<00:03:25.130> just<00:03:25.160> keeping<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.700> simple<00:03:28.030> so<00:03:29.030> there

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
they're just keeping it simple so there

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.270 
they're just keeping it simple so there
you<00:03:29.330> go<00:03:29.480> that's<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.170> third<00:03:30.380> generator<00:03:30.860> nice

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
you go that's the third generator nice

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.780 
you go that's the third generator nice
and<00:03:31.520> easy<00:03:31.640> now<00:03:32.120> you've<00:03:32.270> got<00:03:32.450> all<00:03:32.480> three<00:03:33.790> fired

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
and easy now you've got all three fired

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:49.170 
and easy now you've got all three fired
up<00:03:35.030> so<00:03:35.569> head<00:03:35.810> back<00:03:35.840> towards

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:56.180 

back<00:03:49.810> towards<00:03:50.110> the<00:03:50.290> main<00:03:50.530> power<00:03:50.769> generator

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:04.960 

huh

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:13.739 

it<00:04:05.970> was<00:04:06.090> kind<00:04:06.300> of<00:04:06.360> close

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:13.749 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:18.360 

so<00:04:14.749> you<00:04:14.840> gotta<00:04:14.989> line<00:04:15.260> these<00:04:15.499> things<00:04:15.829> up

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:25.439

the<00:04:40.250> symbols<00:04:40.699> on<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.360> map<00:04:41.410> line<00:04:42.410> up<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.800> how

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
the symbols on the map line up to how

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:48.490 
the symbols on the map line up to how
they<00:04:43.099> need<00:04:43.250> to<00:04:43.430> be<00:04:46.509> on<00:04:47.509> the<00:04:47.870> generator<00:04:48.259> so

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
they need to be on the generator so

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.279 
they need to be on the generator so
you've<00:04:48.650> got<00:04:48.800> three<00:04:49.220> o'clock<00:04:49.520> for<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.000> water
