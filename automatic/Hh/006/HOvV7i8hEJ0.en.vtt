00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.200
 there are very good everyone here the killer and 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:08.109
 today I bring you another seed and one more 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.429
 very good seed we already know there are more 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.829
 options and here paste the in the seed 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:17.500
 the seeds are called too many creepers 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.439
 so it's okay you crazy they can 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.929
 memorize but then of all the tejera 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.089
 I'll leave it in the description so that 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:29.529
 copy and paste it easy too many 

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:32.410
 creepers and you're already don creating new world 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:36.010
 and they are going to see this is a seed made 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:38.410
 for people who like to survive is 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.989
 a real challenge they will see because it is 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.030
 an island but the best island of all 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.550
 that I really liked it a lot for 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.840
 survival here the truth if they seek 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.829
 a challenge 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:52.850
 this is the island indicated seriously not 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.940
 is a seed is a simple seed and 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.940
 it is very very very very very very very very 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.370
 entertaining as you see is an island see it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.250
 normal and not what if you will say then 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.440
 how we do it if there is no way 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.350
 trees so easy you have 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.630
 than finding them down there what they have 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:14.479
 what to do is to go down then to break 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.549
 this breaks in this and as you see is already 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.890
 falling and the water is already only going down 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.220
 what would be the water already 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.840
 it would work as an elevator and now 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.770
 they have to enter here I said I put 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:29.600
 torches torches torches la 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.659
 truth is the best seed I've 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.049
 found now for these versions 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:39.009
 and well, they come in here and I think 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:42.200
 they go here if you remember here 

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:43.880
 they fell and they go here and this is where 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.700
 let's find what would be 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:53.049
 the good thing we go there is not true 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.049
 the following the 119 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.490
 in our parts I will not try not 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.970
 show them a lot I do not like me 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.610
 show them a lot of things where they are 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.140
 the locations because then that 's part 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.800
 of you new if you would not be 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.170
 looking for seeds you this one touches 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.810
 explore it but the truth is that it is 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.670
 very very very very father because look like 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.240
 there is no wood what they have to do is 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:19.240
 come here 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.129
 and find them for you, you 're just going to 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.620
 have to come here and break it to 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.379
 you but it 's difficult because I do not know 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.150
 they make it easy for the mods that there are and then 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:33.689
 to find ways what they need 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:37.799
 here they find what would be the 

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:40.319
 wood when you cut these things down but 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:44.340
 experiences that there were more chests I do not know 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:46.470
 if mike is that to find them is that 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.000
 if it was very low or not what it is 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.359
 I tell them why I tell them that it is a great 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.540
 challenge but that is very fun and 

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:56.290
 has this what would be being chests 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.420
 for 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:02.859
 to do it to charm and things like that 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.109
 let me see if I find it and see if 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.569
 If I find it, well then, if not 

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:11.439
 we are already saying goodbye I forgot 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:15.330
 tell them that good down here they go up 

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:18.590
 and break this block quoted 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.590
 and the wait 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.799
 and here is a spa where what would come to 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:26.000
 be not spider but there are drawers 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:29.690
 remember what I always tell you about 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.000
 drawers the version I am when right now 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:35.840
 in version 1.6 points 2 if you too 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.090
 you have version 1.6 1.6 point 2 you are going 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:43.069
 to leave exactly this but if you have 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.489
 1.6 point 1 1 point 6.2 whatever this is 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:49.459
 the map will come out but I would change what 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:51.950
 that would be the chests that is not 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.010
 these things that we are seeing would come out 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.599
 but if you have a 1.6 point 2 then you 

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:59.990
 it would come out the same as right now we are 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:03.080
 seeing and then in what we stay 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.990
 what I was looking for but well there 

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.290
 they see iron good guys, well, good 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.600
 I have not found it but the fact is that 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:16.210
 Well, you know, it's a mine and it has 

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:16.210
 enough chests 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.570
 I already explored it a bit but I tell you 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.330
 it's a bit farfetched and 

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.950
 well that is a very father island 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.180
 really liked that idea that there was not 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:32.010
 wood and you have to come to get 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:35.910
 from here not because you have to enter the 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:37.920
 mine and look for it because yes it is a 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:40.170
 abandoned mine and has as it is called 

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.850
 has what would come from being 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:47.250
 always the abandoned mines so 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:50.289
 have the the train tracks or the 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.089
 more wood and all that 

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:55.749
 Well, it's father, not because you have to 

00:04:52.089 --> 00:04:58.539
 enter here to look for it and then try 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:05:02.030
 do not kill the monkeys because if there 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:05.000
 It's quite like I'm telling you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:08.330
 it is a very father seed because it is 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.160
 a big challenge for those who do not know 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.930
 feel prepared that you like the 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.390
 seeds of 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:17.150
 worlds like that 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:19.490
 of islands of survival to me in what 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.400
 personal, I do not like them as you see here 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:25.550
 it's more wood that you have to come to 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:29.510
 look for there the two rails 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:31.449
 of the days train tracks or flu axis 

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:36.599
 That's what it's called 

00:05:31.449 --> 00:05:36.599
 well let's say goodbye on behalf of 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:41.319
 of the click as it is called the name of 

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:43.960
 the seeds many creepers for here there are 

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:46.479
 two flu so you can see good here 

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:48.699
 They are like those who would come to be seen 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:51.580
 the woods here from here where they have 

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:56.680
 to get the wood coming in here and then 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:59.979
 good helping with enchanted arch and everything 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:02.139
 well, it 's very, very good, 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:04.870
 really liked this idea the truth is that 

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:06.630
 they have quite a lot of spawn 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:10.680
 monsters 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:14.990
 they still do not cause a zombie with armor 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:14.990
 with almost full gold armor 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.250
 It is very good, it is very good 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.920
 seed the truth if they want a challenge they 

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:25.130
 I recommend it 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.430
 and then it 's all until the next seed 

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:30.800
 goodbye the rating that I give to the 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.010
 seed in this seed I will give two 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.390
 qualifications because one would be if you 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:39.140
 you are looking for 

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:41.780
 a map seed if you're looking 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:43.760
 one and is the rival how is this is 

00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:47.240
 your seed is the best seed I have 

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.030
 seen so far from island maps its 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.580
 rival how are you and the truth is very very 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:55.280
 very very difficult is a challenge for all 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:58.460
 those who like this type of maps 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:07:02.870
 and the rating would be 10 because then 

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:05.000
 the truth is difficult is a challenge and therefore 

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:08.000
 have a 

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.250
 a great goal for surviving but 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.770
 it has it exquisite because you have 

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.760
 to go in there in order to 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.830
 find wood because as it is a place 

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:21.470
 Now we have seen that it has wood because 

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:23.210
 it's like an abandoned mine and for 

00:07:21.470 --> 00:07:25.940
 I would also have to find food 

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.640
 killing zombies and well this is a great 

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:32.150
 I recommend the challenge if what you are looking for 

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:34.520
 it is an island its living paranormal if it is a 

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:36.350
 normal world would be a 4.5 or up 

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:40.430
 least I do not know I would give it 0 because I do not 

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:43.220
 they like maps like that but well 

00:07:40.430 --> 00:07:44.840
 normal rating would be a 4.5 

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:49.040
 more or less because then it does not have there 

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:51.250
 it's just an island and then it's just 

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:56.240
 recommended for those who are looking 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:59.860
 that would be the island its rival and then 

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.860
 good is all goodbye
