00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:15.870
 healthy everyone my name is newton and today 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.720
 show you the mod called meta 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.329
 worlds mod and this mod allows us 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:24.300
 reduce increase block sizes 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:27.929
 rotate them in space and generally can 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.849
 transfer blocks different to another 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:32.040
 space in new space and 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.840
 let's just build for starters 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.480
 small platform me a little 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.210
 podlagivaet is not annoying but now 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 not about this here 's a platform 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.590
 unpretentious let's even more 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.450
 I will do something completely miserable 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.250
 Well, about this platform you need 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.610
 so that it must be divorced from 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.800
 of the earth hung like air here like mine 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:55.020
 take the first block then I'm all all 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.690
 Kraft blocks show their strength 7 by the way 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.380
 blocks take 1 which is called 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.750
 Content shows a world crater crater then 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:06.869
 there he allows us to change that is 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.270
 introduces our platform into a new dimension 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.280
 put this block and as we can see 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.240
 our platform has been updated now it is 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.520
 new dimension 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.109
 Take for example the super block 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.359
 sizing unit and set its size to ours 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.299
 platforms increased and that's pretty 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:26.159
 fun to look at me I'm the same as 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.759
 blocks anymore I can not on them now 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.399
 jump food is great you can do 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.229
 beautiful and interesting maps and let's 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.859
 a little more can be increased to 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.799
 incredible size to increase this 

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:44.850
 these blocks this platform she even leaves 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.670
 down here as you can see in other blocks but 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.060
 this 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.799
 not so important because these are different 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.960
 blocks exist in different spaces 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.890
 and so take for example this block 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.619
 which we will have to reduce the size and 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.659
 reduce it several times and 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.460
 as we see the platform has become very 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.909
 small just petite 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.190
 still put and here is such a can 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.580
 make compact schemes roadstone schemes 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.130
 and it would be very interesting to look at 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.430
 such schemes the next block scale raises 

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:20.620
 block it returns to normal size 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.510
 we will insert all this business and we select 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.170
 is such a great platform it seems 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.870
 shifted or seems fine to me 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.870
 the next block we have is a world controller 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.940
 we put it for example here and now 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.030
 take for example an empty hand and 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.819
 and right click on this 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.860
 block great turn i can fly 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.680
 turn my head and with me will 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.200
 rotate the platform is great and very 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.370
 interesting idea how do you see i can 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.400
 move her 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.709
 he can go there and move unfortunately 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.230
 seemingly up she can't those i can 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.000
 moving blocks is just awesome 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.380
 see for example we put it 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:06.459
 Well, so much so that she does not 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:09.070
 flew well over there put it and all I 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.750
 I can click on the left shift and jump 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.890
 as you can see the platform is now worth it 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.070
 so uneven 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.560
 with our blocks namely at an angle we 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:19.750
 we can run on it and do anything 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.640
 this new dimension is very interesting 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:26.530
 there is also a world l diner or 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.140
 engineer and the awful name is simple 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.739
 put it not you again clicked on this 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:35.680
 block shift put here and here our 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:38.170
 the platform disappeared because yes they 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.150
 rotate it can fly off to the thread and 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.859
 you will be uncomfortable there we have such 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.959
 platform and it will be out of place there 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:46.299
 just remove it with this one 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:49.630
 block well there is also such a 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:52.269
 block put it for example here as 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.760
 see he now stands at an angle 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:56.349
 we can build to it in a block here 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.799
 let's just try to build 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:02.769
 hence the line and from here it is a line 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.629
 will also be at an angle stage awesome 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:08.200
 can you build any such things 

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:10.090
 See immediately two measurements of blocks to 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:13.209
 cool maps on parkour by the way, you can 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.580
 do the truth i'm stuck here a little but 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:17.739
 it does not matter because to a great 

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:19.989
 blog so let's see craft &amp; craft 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.729
 the first unit we have here is this 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.930
 which is the most important unit without which 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:29.349
 almost nothing will 9 blocks of land 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.450
 the next nine blocks of cobble stone 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:36.580
 rather, the next nine blocks 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:40.890
 glass one block glass also 9 broc 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:45.700
 blocks of gravel 9 blocks 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:49.060
 boards of ordinary wooden boards 9 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.940
 blocks of sand and wool that are not there to 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:54.159
 place in general so here so let's 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.820
 I will try to just do something 

00:04:54.159 --> 00:05:03.669
 An interesting example is such a Christmas tree 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:07.030
 change and dig in and a little bit so 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:08.680
 great and put but this unit 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:11.969
 for example, here I think not much 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:17.050
 interfere will be fine now do it 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:20.940
 smaller our Christmas tree set here such 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.190
 block in right click and move it 

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:30.430
 I don't want to go there somewhere 

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:34.479
 I want to go there fine shift and see 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:36.640
 you can carry a herringbone to the house 

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:37.150
 Just put such a New Year's Eve where 

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:39.490
 anything 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:43.659
 next to the workbench so she will forever 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:45.969
 pleased and yes it's just fucking possible 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:49.659
 knock these blocks down and see it even 

00:05:45.969 --> 00:05:51.969
 rotates now I'm stuck in it here 

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:55.390
 such a thing is very interesting 

00:05:51.969 --> 00:05:56.980
 rotating Christmas tree and by the way there are small 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:58.510
 bugs with this mod 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.610
 if you have designs on your 

00:05:58.510 --> 00:06:02.560
 a tree platform or even a house which 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.740
 want to change there are some things 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:09.250
 like doors for example i know for sure 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.740
 that the doors and the torch are any ordinary torches 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.510
 who shine or redstone torch they 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:16.840
 will not decrease just fall out to you 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:19.600
 drop drop and yes of course 

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:22.300
 problem especially in redstone circuits in 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:25.840
 which need redstone torch 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.240
 these are the things guys and that's it 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.770
 Here is such an interesting mod, I hope you 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:32.620
 I liked it just like me 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:33.730
