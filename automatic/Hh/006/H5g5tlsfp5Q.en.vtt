00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:20.020
 president of the nation 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:22.120
 to see 20 it seems as if I chose them 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.600
 with the letter s good now it is a bit 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:29.710
 more more affable president of the nation 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:34.620
 with the s I want to say that I am one of the 

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.620
 more uneducated people there is that 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.840
 if that is the name but not the noval 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.840
 the second name does not not worth not worth 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.160
 rodrÃ­guez 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:07.350
 Now there's almost good you get no number 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:07.350
 and I'll take the category 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.170
 and if not, you bring him 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:19.590
 football objects or that can be 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.590
 with the letter r 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.860
 how much are we going 21 now it's good 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.860
 counted 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:35.870
 the 6 finally behind we also know 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.970
 the elements of the house elements of the 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:42.970
 house with the letter f 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.420
 with the letter f 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:05.949
 little vale is worth vale is valid that says 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.949
 the outside is fine 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:12.460
 and you will see well 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.590
 9 letter 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:25.539
 or the letter and it touches you 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.539
 it seems as if they had been technicians 

00:05:27.899 --> 00:05:31.529
 but of course 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.430
 that is, the problem
