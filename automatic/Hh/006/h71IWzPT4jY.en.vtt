I<00:01:17.100> think<00:01:18.100> for<00:01:18.190> the<00:01:18.250> music<00:01:18.490> camp<00:01:18.640> participants

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:18.760 
I think for the music camp participants

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:20.760 
I think for the music camp participants
if<00:01:19.600> there's<00:01:19.780> anything<00:01:19.960> I<00:01:20.200> could<00:01:20.380> personally

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
if there's anything I could personally

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.530 
if there's anything I could personally
convey<00:01:21.190> it's<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.580> to<00:01:21.700> absorb<00:01:22.060> as<00:01:22.240> much<00:01:22.270> as

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:22.540 
convey it's just to absorb as much as

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:24.870 
convey it's just to absorb as much as
you<00:01:22.600> can<00:01:22.810> here<00:01:23.110> with<00:01:23.860> all<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.250> these<00:01:24.369> soloists

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
you can here with all of these soloists

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.760 
you can here with all of these soloists
and<00:01:25.030> all<00:01:25.300> the<00:01:25.420> conductors<00:01:25.840> and<00:01:26.140> everything

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
and all the conductors and everything

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.370 
and all the conductors and everything
going<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.070> here<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:28.330> there<00:01:28.600> be<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.780> and<00:01:29.110> being

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
going on here and there be a and being

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.630 
going on here and there be a and being
in<00:01:29.470> this<00:01:29.530> beautiful<00:01:29.740> setting<00:01:30.040> I<00:01:30.250> think<00:01:30.490> it's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
in this beautiful setting I think it's

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.760 
in this beautiful setting I think it's
so<00:01:31.540> important<00:01:31.960> to<00:01:31.990> act<00:01:32.170> just<00:01:32.440> be<00:01:32.560> like<00:01:32.740> a

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
so important to act just be like a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.560 
so important to act just be like a
sponge<00:01:33.070> and<00:01:33.340> just<00:01:33.430> absorb<00:01:34.090> everything<00:01:34.390> you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
sponge and just absorb everything you
