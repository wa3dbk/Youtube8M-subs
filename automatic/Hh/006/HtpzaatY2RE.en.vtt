00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
and you catch a lot more fish bigger is

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.630 
and you catch a lot more fish bigger is
better<00:00:31.080> when<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.650> size<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.980> the<00:00:32.040> fish<00:00:32.250> but<00:00:32.489> not

better when the size of the fish but not

necessarily the catch let's start off

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.270 
necessarily the catch let's start off
with<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.829> hook

the smaller the hook you would think a

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.270 
the smaller the hook you would think a
big<00:00:37.170> hook<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.500> catching<00:00:37.829> but<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:37.980> lot<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.219> these

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
big hook of catching but a lot of these

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.950 
big hook of catching but a lot of these
fish<00:00:38.489> are<00:00:38.670> pretty<00:00:38.850> small<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.300> little<00:00:39.540> one<00:00:39.809> will

fish are pretty small a little one will

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.450 
fish are pretty small a little one will
catch<00:00:40.110> great<00:00:40.379> big<00:00:40.559> fish<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> it<00:00:41.129> really

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
catch great big fish and it really

catches<00:00:41.610> the<00:00:41.850> small<00:00:42.120> ones<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.570> lot<00:00:43.110> better

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
catches the small ones a lot better

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.440

you<00:00:44.129> always<00:00:44.250> put<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.610> worm<00:00:44.820> on<00:00:44.969> there<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.180> lot<00:00:45.360> of

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
you always put a worm on there a lot of

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.670 
you always put a worm on there a lot of
times<00:00:45.629> what<00:00:45.809> happens<00:00:45.840> you<00:00:46.320> have<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.530> look

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
times what happens you have the look

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
times what happens you have the look
nibblers<00:00:47.070> your<00:00:47.219> worm<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.550> always<00:00:47.789> gone<00:00:47.940> that

little<00:00:48.570> hook<00:00:48.719> works<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.230> much<00:00:49.350> better<00:00:49.410> put<00:00:50.219> a

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
little hook works so much better put a

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.400 
little hook works so much better put a
little<00:00:50.550> split<00:00:50.820> shot<00:00:51.030> above<00:00:51.360> it<00:00:51.510> just<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.230> few

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
little split shot above it just a few

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.260 
little split shot above it just a few
inches<00:00:52.559> above<00:00:52.890> your<00:00:53.070> hook<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.399> then<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:53.969> bobber

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
inches above your hook and then a bobber

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.779 
inches above your hook and then a bobber
the<00:00:55.050> bobber<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.620> smaller<00:00:55.949> you<00:00:56.129> have<00:00:56.340> the<00:00:56.640> more

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
the bobber the smaller you have the more

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
the bobber the smaller you have the more
sensitive<00:00:57.239> it's<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> be<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:58.320> want<00:00:58.469> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sensitive it's going to be you want to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:59.569 
sensitive it's going to be you want to
make<00:00:58.649> sure<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.890> big<00:00:58.980> enough<00:00:59.039> it<00:00:59.340> won't<00:00:59.430> go

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
make sure it's big enough it won't go

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.160 
make sure it's big enough it won't go
under<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> water<00:00:59.910> with<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.390> sinker<00:01:00.809> but<00:01:01.079> if

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
under the water with the sinker but if

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.420 
under the water with the sinker but if
you<00:01:01.230> use<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> small<00:01:01.680> one<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.890> don't<00:01:02.010> need<00:01:02.250> much

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you use a small one you don't need much

you use a small one you don't need much
and<00:01:02.730> use<00:01:03.210> a<00:01:03.270> small<00:01:03.600> one<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.989> just<00:01:04.140> clip<00:01:04.439> it<00:01:04.559> on

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
and use a small one you just clip it on

you're going to get a lot of a lot of
snags<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> put<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.180> down<00:01:09.270> really<00:01:09.540> deep<00:01:09.600> put

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
snags if you put it down really deep put

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
snags if you put it down really deep put
it<00:01:10.260> pretty<00:01:10.409> shallow<00:01:10.650> say<00:01:10.979> a<00:01:11.010> foot<00:01:11.310> down<00:01:11.520> it's

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
it pretty shallow say a foot down it's

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.280 
it pretty shallow say a foot down it's

not going to snag as much and most of

look into the Sun they can see better
everything's<00:01:17.009> dark<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.400> they<00:01:17.490> look<00:01:17.640> down

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
everything's dark when they look down

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.760 
everything's dark when they look down
it's<00:01:18.360> about<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.570> foot<00:01:18.780> down<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.409> these<00:01:19.590> are

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's about a foot down and these are

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.530 
it's about a foot down and these are
really<00:01:19.920> simple<00:01:20.189> these<00:01:20.400> bobbers<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.390> just

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
really simple these bobbers you just

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.330 
really simple these bobbers you just
adjust<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.140> you<00:01:22.320> push<00:01:22.500> it<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:22.860> clip<00:01:23.130> in

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
adjust it you push it and they clip in

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.149 
adjust it you push it and they clip in
very<00:01:24.060> simple<00:01:24.509> line<00:01:25.170> here<00:01:25.650> again<00:01:25.830> let's<00:01:26.040> go

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
very simple line here again let's go

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.609 
very simple line here again let's go
light<00:01:26.400> six<00:01:27.119> pound<00:01:27.299> test<00:01:27.570> is<00:01:27.840> really<00:01:28.080> universal

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
light six pound test is really universal

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.530 
light six pound test is really universal
eight<00:01:28.829> maybe<00:01:29.310> would<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> highest<00:01:30.329> end
