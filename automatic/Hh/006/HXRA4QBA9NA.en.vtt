this<00:00:51.989> real<00:00:52.289> exact<00:00:52.710> since<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.760> making<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
this real exact since I'm making a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.279 
this real exact since I'm making a
tutorial<00:00:54.180> about<00:00:54.510> this<00:00:54.840> but<00:01:00.079> looks<00:01:01.079> good

enough<00:01:04.100> so<00:01:05.100> pretty<00:01:05.250> much<00:01:05.339> that's<00:01:05.580> what<00:01:05.760> we<00:01:05.850> got

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
enough so pretty much that's what we got

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.630 
enough so pretty much that's what we got
so<00:01:06.119> far<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> then<00:01:07.650> if<00:01:07.830> you<00:01:07.950> want<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.250> just<00:01:08.430> add

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:46.880 

let<00:01:38.340> me<00:01:38.490> zoom<00:01:38.670> in<00:01:38.880> real<00:01:39.180> quick

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.980 

just<00:01:47.890> ctrl<00:01:48.340> T<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.850> then<00:01:49.270> we<00:01:49.450> can<00:01:49.630> actually

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
just ctrl T and then we can actually

just ctrl T and then we can actually
click<00:01:50.200> drag<00:01:50.950> this<00:01:51.220> like<00:01:51.700> we<00:01:51.820> did<00:01:51.970> before<00:01:52.090> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
click drag this like we did before and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.050 
click drag this like we did before and
then<00:01:54.310> we'll<00:01:55.320> rotate<00:01:56.320> this<00:01:56.770> 90<00:01:57.430> degrees<00:01:58.350> and

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
then we'll rotate this 90 degrees and

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.270 
then we'll rotate this 90 degrees and
then<00:02:01.060> just<00:02:01.540> drag<00:02:01.960> this<00:02:02.230> right<00:02:02.800> over<00:02:02.950> here<00:02:03.070> on

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
then just drag this right over here on

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.620 
then just drag this right over here on
the<00:02:03.370> side<00:02:05.310> we<00:02:06.310> get<00:02:06.520> down<00:02:06.670> to<00:02:06.700> the<00:02:06.820> little<00:02:07.480> bit

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
the side we get down to the little bit

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:14.130 
the side we get down to the little bit
of<00:02:07.720> nitty-gritty<00:02:09.270> zoom<00:02:10.270> in<00:02:10.450> right<00:02:10.660> here<00:02:13.140> we

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
of nitty-gritty zoom in right here we

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:20.340 
of nitty-gritty zoom in right here we
can<00:02:14.590> go<00:02:17.910> here<00:02:18.910> and<00:02:19.090> actually<00:02:19.600> try<00:02:19.990> to<00:02:20.080> line

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
can go here and actually try to line

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:21.870 
can go here and actually try to line
this<00:02:20.530> up<00:02:20.710> here<00:02:20.890> to<00:02:21.010> make<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> little<00:02:21.640> bit<00:02:21.760> better

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
this up here to make a little bit better

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.660 
this up here to make a little bit better
and<00:02:23.010> then<00:02:24.010> just<00:02:24.220> apply<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.520> transformation

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and then just apply the transformation

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.780 
and then just apply the transformation
and<00:02:25.480> then<00:02:25.720> it's<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:26.110> in<00:02:26.200> line<00:02:26.380> there<00:02:26.640> we<00:02:27.640> can

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
and then it's right in line there we can

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:33.510 
and then it's right in line there we can
zoom<00:02:28.000> out<00:02:28.180> I<00:02:30.959> think<00:02:31.959> if<00:02:32.140> I<00:02:32.350> just<00:02:32.680> sit<00:02:32.800> control-

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520 
zoom out I think if I just sit control-

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.449 
zoom out I think if I just sit control-
is<00:02:33.700> amount<00:02:34.060> yep<00:02:34.380> and<00:02:35.380> so<00:02:35.950> that's<00:02:36.100> what<00:02:36.220> we<00:02:36.310> get

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
is amount yep and so that's what we get

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.260 
is amount yep and so that's what we get
so<00:02:36.610> far<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:38.190> now<00:02:39.190> we<00:02:39.250> can<00:02:39.610> just<00:02:39.640> add<00:02:39.910> in<00:02:40.060> some

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:40.270
