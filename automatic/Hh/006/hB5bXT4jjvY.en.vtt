00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.190 
despite being on a smaller console the
controls<00:03:33.440> kind<00:03:33.890> of<00:03:34.360> need<00:03:35.360> some<00:03:35.690> getting<00:03:35.989> used

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
controls kind of need some getting used

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:36.670

handling feel slow and not really fluent
at<00:03:53.209> all<00:03:53.360> it's<00:03:54.019> kind<00:03:54.500> of<00:03:54.590> like<00:03:54.769> with<00:03:54.950> The<00:03:55.580> Legend

Metal Gear kind of feels really slow and

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.479 
Metal Gear kind of feels really slow and
clunky<00:04:05.390> but<00:04:06.230> there<00:04:06.440> is<00:04:06.650> an<00:04:06.860> option<00:04:07.220> to<00:04:07.250> switch

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489

even makes any sense the camera is also
a<00:04:12.110> pain<00:04:12.379> to<00:04:12.530> maneuver<00:04:12.950> with<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.280> main<00:04:13.459> buttons
