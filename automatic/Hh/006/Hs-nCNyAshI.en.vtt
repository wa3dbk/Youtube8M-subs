00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:03.570
 in another subject before the afternoon a new style of feeding that was our 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.730
 country it's about the photo food raw dehydrated food without tacc it 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.599
 maintain the essential nutrients for the functioning of our body 

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:15.219
 he assures his followers we know the tendency the note in which they wait is 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.650
 you imagine yourself eating all the food imposed 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.819
 undoubtedly something that can be a bit strange 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.589
 but in the world it is a trend that is taking place and is already beginning to reach 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.849
 Chile 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.450
 it's about ranking a stream that we avoid without giving the food so that 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:39.750
 these do not lose their nutrients what they have cc 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.650
 the food clothes year 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.790
 being a raw food ok said that it is also called 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.780
 the food under a process where they are kept 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.590
 your own natural infanta 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.690
 and it's about keeping your that essential so much this mine minerals proteins 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.280
 as nutrient tito and over 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.870
 chain 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.080
 the clear objective 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.399
 18 years 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.700
 what is mentioned and has its own edible garden 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.940
 based on visiting them organic I wonder how they should increase the 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.620
 controls 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.520
 North Korea 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.600
 I think it's kind of messed up 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.410
 This one has to eat 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.160
 but when I met al qaeda 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.409
 the producer 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.620
 but like all his life 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:29.490
 I've noticed that the woman denounced her with a clean energy 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.620
 a very special summer event 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.540
 in a note a lot of food instead being with a little garlic in that context 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.540
 indicated that afp is very efficient 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.030
 a true lifestyle 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.470
 and those who cultivate it 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.160
 often believe that the higher the percentage of food 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.380
 lu2 in the diet 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.800
 greater will be the health benefits not recommended women 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.670
 within the diet 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.909
 body as many fruits and vegetables 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.610
 who left 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.640
 but they did not start saying that you have to 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:06.130
 all the diet 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.189
 by elements for food 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.579
 For those who do not want to eat raw foods there are these products 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:16.660
 dehydrated which achieve a feeling of fullness 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.720
 and allows us to eat less and stay in shape what we do one of the 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.009
 stations concentrate the favor dayz is that I could not more time 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:27.879
 if finally this Monday 2 to 0 to fruits 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:29.739
 where do you get lots of vitamins 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.519
 vegetables where they are left to much my life incited nutrients 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.199
 and nuts where much acetyl fatty acid will be accessed 

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:40.269
 unsaturated monounsaturated which are very beneficial too 

00:02:40.779 --> 00:02:44.389
 the prd the mixture of these can be made preparation is very similar to the 

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:47.099
 that already exists 

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.550
 the strange radio 3 of rne and in that context of almonds 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:55.110
 and spinach rolls stuffed with a monk are part of the gastronomy that 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.800
 It can be done by combining raw and dehydrated products the basic idea of 

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.049
 the masnou cooking food 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.529
 the but do not separate 

00:03:04.529 --> 00:03:08.569
 efe is not going to be noticed as a total virgin latour 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:12.279
 what is made on the basis of all foods by colors and that goes 

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:16.340
 in the possibility of getting all kinds of nutrients vitamins proteins and 

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:17.359
 minerals 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:20.389
 all kinds of crimes are naturally 

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:24.529
 contribute to our organism a style of feeding that enters with force in 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:28.899
 our country although it is not advisable to start consuming these products of 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:29.849
 just one time 

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.289
 without medical supervision
