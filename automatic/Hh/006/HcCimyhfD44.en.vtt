00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:08.519
 if this fabulous presents tutorial 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.129
 gift February 14 little notebook mosaic 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.549
 of ideal paper to give to friends 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:15.959
 or to the couple this Valentine's Day 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:18.540
 The necessary materials are the 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:21.500
 following a notebook of any 

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:25.080
 size white glue and scissors 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.530
 black acrylic paint and a brush and 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.790
 paper of your favorite colors 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.640
 we will start by painting the cover of the 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.899
 notepad with acrylic paint 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.640
 remember to put a newspaper or something 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.160
 below so they will not paint the 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.790
 mix since the acrylic paint is very 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.790
 difficult to remove 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:45.790
 if necessary a second layer and 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.970
 then wait for it to dry by 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:51.340
 complete once dry we will take a pencil 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.680
 and we will make a drawing in this case 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.600
 we will give a heart but you 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.070
 they can do it with the initial of the name 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.950
 of the person to whom they are going to 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.490
 give a gift or a drawing to this person 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:02.490
 he would like 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.790
 and that's how you're going to see our drawing 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.790
 that will serve as our base 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:17.610
 now we will choose a paper color and 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.610
 we will cut small squares 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.290
 then with the help of a brush 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.600
 we will put glue on the contour 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.900
 of the heart and we will stick the squares of 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.900
 paper 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.260
 and so we will finish the whole contour of 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:54.330
 our heart 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.670
 now we will choose the colors with the 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.490
 that we will fill the heart 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.500
 we chose pink and fuchsia red and 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.490
 we will cut the paper into triangles of 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.490
 different sizes 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.160
 let's paste the paper triangles 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:15.270
 inside our heart until 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.270
 everything is covered 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.350
 ah 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:47.360
 when we finish we will choose others 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.030
 colors to fill the rest of the 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:52.730
 notebook we chose colors 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:54.860
 different from the heart in this 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.569
 occasion we will cut the paper in 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.569
 rectangles of different sizes 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.790
 we will put a sheet of paper under 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.160
 our cover so that the glue does not 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.170
 paste the pages of our notebook and 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.090
 we will begin to fill everything 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.320
 remains of the notebook until it is 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.320
 completely covered 

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:37.690
 and that's how our notebook will be 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:40.900
 all paper mosaics 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.790
 now to finish we will cover all the 

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.370
 cover with a thin layer of 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.730
 glue to make it shiny like 

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.980
 mosaic 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.980
 and then let it dry 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:59.960
 I know that this book will you 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:02.870
 You can add a ribbon or a bow 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.819
 gift so that it is ready to give as a present 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.010
 besides being very good detail for 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.709
 give away is very useful because you can 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.720
