00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
so the mic we're using real quick for

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.350 
so the mic we're using real quick for
our<00:03:15.630> viewers<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:17.070> outtakes<00:03:17.370> I<00:03:17.520> 5<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.180> it's

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360 
our viewers is the outtakes I 5 and it's

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.840 
our viewers is the outtakes I 5 and it's
basically<00:03:18.660> like<00:03:18.780> an<00:03:18.930> equivalent<00:03:19.170> to<00:03:19.770> a<00:03:20.100> shure

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
basically like an equivalent to a shure

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.960 
basically like an equivalent to a shure
sm57<00:03:21.450> and<00:03:21.900> i<00:03:22.710> really<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.310> it<00:03:23.340> because<00:03:23.700> it

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:23.970 
sm57 and i really like it because it

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.810 
sm57 and i really like it because it
captures<00:03:24.390> absolutely<00:03:25.080> no<00:03:25.380> low-end<00:03:26.040> another
