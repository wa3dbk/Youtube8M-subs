around here but it does have a little T
little<00:00:31.529> spot<00:00:32.009> right<00:00:32.040> here<00:00:32.460> so<00:00:32.640> that<00:00:32.759> when<00:00:32.850> you

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
little spot right here so that when you

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.670 
little spot right here so that when you
do<00:00:33.840> set<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:34.620> ground<00:00:36.200> it's<00:00:37.200> actually

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
do set it on the ground it's actually

do set it on the ground it's actually
off<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.100> ground<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.430> little<00:00:38.520> bit<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:41.100> has<00:00:41.340> a

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
off the ground a little bit so it has a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.560 
off the ground a little bit so it has a
very<00:00:41.850> nice<00:00:42.950> grip<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.730> display<00:00:45.180> I'll<00:00:45.360> get

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
very nice grip and the display I'll get

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.450 
very nice grip and the display I'll get
to<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.930> minute<00:00:47.420> it<00:00:48.420> has<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:49.140> very<00:00:49.680> nice<00:00:50.010> coil

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
to in a minute it has a very nice coil

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:00.369 
to in a minute it has a very nice coil
and<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:52.579> pretty<00:00:54.829> nice<00:00:57.739> is<00:00:58.739> still<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.280> coil<00:00:59.670> but

it's completely waterproof um your
targets<00:01:05.220> will<00:01:05.430> all<00:01:05.700> end<00:01:06.060> up<00:01:06.210> right<00:01:06.479> here<00:01:06.720> here

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
targets will all end up right here here

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.830 
targets will all end up right here here
pinpointing<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.299> everything<00:01:09.299> will<00:01:09.479> wind<00:01:09.659> up

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
pinpointing and everything will wind up

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.450 
pinpointing and everything will wind up
right<00:01:10.080> there<00:01:11.000> so<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.030> will<00:01:12.299> be<00:01:12.720> doing<00:01:12.869> a<00:01:13.110> lot<00:01:13.229> of

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
detecting on this channel that's gonna

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.210 
detecting on this channel that's gonna
be<00:01:17.640> my<00:01:17.820> main<00:01:18.030> thing<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.600> just<00:01:19.590> get<00:01:19.890> to<00:01:20.040> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
so that's pretty much all it is for the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.800 
so that's pretty much all it is for the
menu<00:02:31.700> and<00:02:32.700> one<00:02:32.940> really<00:02:33.300> nice<00:02:33.450> thing<00:02:33.780> about

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
menu and one really nice thing about

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.490 
menu and one really nice thing about
this<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:35.250> that<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.670> has<00:02:35.820> a<00:02:37.280> pin<00:02:38.280> point<00:02:39.500> feature

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
this is that it has a pin point feature

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.890 
this is that it has a pin point feature
which<00:02:40.920> lets<00:02:40.950> you<00:02:41.490> find<00:02:41.940> exactly<00:02:42.600> where<00:02:42.780> your

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
which lets you find exactly where your

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.290 
which lets you find exactly where your
target<00:02:43.080> is<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.740> then<00:02:44.310> you<00:02:44.400> can<00:02:44.430> probe<00:02:44.850> for<00:02:45.180> it

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:45.300 
target is and then you can probe for it

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.110 
target is and then you can probe for it
with<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:45.540> screwdriver<00:02:46.070> or<00:02:47.070> such<00:02:48.500> anything

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
with the screwdriver or such anything

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.000 
with the screwdriver or such anything
okay<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.150> then<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.690> have<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> wide<00:02:52.380> range<00:02:52.739> of

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
okay and then you have a wide range of

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.050 
okay and then you have a wide range of
senses<00:02:53.459> so<00:02:54.360> if<00:02:54.450> you're<00:02:54.630> in<00:02:55.850> somewhere<00:02:56.850> where

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
senses so if you're in somewhere where

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.970 
senses so if you're in somewhere where
there's<00:02:57.270> a<00:02:57.330> lot<00:02:57.480> of<00:02:57.600> electric<00:02:58.790> like<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> lot<00:03:00.180> of

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there's a lot of electric like a lot of

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.670 
there's a lot of electric like a lot of
electronic<00:03:01.980> activity<00:03:02.660> you<00:03:03.660> use<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:04.230> your

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
electronic activity you use it your

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.000 
electronic activity you use it your
sensitivity<00:03:05.340> about<00:03:05.430> they're<00:03:06.350> out<00:03:07.350> somewhere

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
sensitivity about they're out somewhere

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.100 
sensitivity about they're out somewhere
else<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.459> can<00:03:08.489> get<00:03:10.100> full<00:03:11.100> sense<00:03:11.459> Tiffany<00:03:12.110> the

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
else you can get full sense Tiffany the

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.720 
else you can get full sense Tiffany the
Mac<00:03:13.320> deep<00:03:14.040> thing<00:03:14.400> I've<00:03:14.580> ever<00:03:14.610> found<00:03:15.030> if<00:03:15.270> it<00:03:15.480> was

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
Mac deep thing I've ever found if it was

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.970 
Mac deep thing I've ever found if it was
10<00:03:17.750> inches<00:03:18.750> I<00:03:19.080> think<00:03:19.970> 10<00:03:20.970> inches<00:03:21.299> give<00:03:21.510> or<00:03:21.540> take

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
10 inches I think 10 inches give or take

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.680 
10 inches I think 10 inches give or take
so<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.310> have<00:03:23.640> your<00:03:23.850> little<00:03:24.030> depth<00:03:24.390> gauge

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
so you have your little depth gauge

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:27.170 
so you have your little depth gauge
right<00:03:24.930> here<00:03:25.200> new<00:03:26.040> arrow<00:03:26.280> will<00:03:26.489> pop<00:03:26.760> up<00:03:26.790> that

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
right here new arrow will pop up that

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.449 
right here new arrow will pop up that
look<00:03:27.390> that's<00:03:27.720> a<00:03:27.900> reverse<00:03:28.200> of<00:03:28.470> that<00:03:28.650> one<00:03:28.860> will

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
look that's a reverse of that one will

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.150 
look that's a reverse of that one will
come<00:03:29.489> down<00:03:29.850> here<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.269> just<00:03:30.480> kind<00:03:30.810> of<00:03:31.070> point<00:03:32.070> to

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
come down here and just kind of point to

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.720 
come down here and just kind of point to
it

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.780 

it<00:03:39.299> runs<00:03:39.570> on<00:03:39.780> two<00:03:40.100> batteries<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.989> nine<00:03:43.260> volt

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:43.790 
it runs on two batteries to nine volt

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:47.410 
it runs on two batteries to nine volt
and<00:03:44.790> it<00:03:44.970> also<00:03:45.090> has<00:03:45.420> a<00:03:45.450> discrimination<00:03:46.170> feature

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
and it also has a discrimination feature

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.350 
and it also has a discrimination feature
so<00:03:48.420> if<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:49.200> only<00:03:49.350> want<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.709> find<00:03:50.360> Penny's

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
so if I only want to find Penny's

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.320 
so if I only want to find Penny's
quarters<00:03:51.930> and<00:03:52.140> 50<00:03:52.560> cent<00:03:52.799> pieces<00:03:53.040> I<00:03:53.430> could<00:03:54.150> just

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:54.330 
quarters and 50 cent pieces I could just

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.130 
quarters and 50 cent pieces I could just
do<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.660> or<00:03:54.989> I<00:03:55.019> could<00:03:55.320> I<00:03:56.780> usually<00:03:57.780> keep<00:03:57.959> it

00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.140 
do that or I could I usually keep it

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:03.530 
do that or I could I usually keep it
with<00:03:58.200> two<00:03:58.820> it's<00:03:59.820> all<00:03:59.970> I<00:04:00.000> need<00:04:01.880> these<00:04:02.880> are<00:04:03.150> built

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
with two it's all I need these are built

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.289 
with two it's all I need these are built
in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:04.080> USA<00:04:04.500> and<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:08.070> basically<00:04:08.610> a<00:04:08.730> prism

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
in the USA and it's basically a prism

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:12.890 
in the USA and it's basically a prism
three<00:04:09.600> with<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> few<00:04:10.290> upgrades<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:11.600> I<00:04:12.600> believe

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
three with a few upgrades and I believe

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.330 
three with a few upgrades and I believe
the<00:04:13.079> prism<00:04:13.470> 3<00:04:13.769> retails<00:04:14.370> for<00:04:14.519> about<00:04:14.780> $300<00:04:15.780> and

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
the prism 3 retails for about $300 and

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.050 
the prism 3 retails for about $300 and
this<00:04:18.530> retails<00:04:19.530> for<00:04:19.739> a<00:04:20.310> hundred<00:04:20.729> and<00:04:20.880> eighty

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
this retails for a hundred and eighty

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:24.969 
this retails for a hundred and eighty
dollars<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.620> it's<00:04:22.830> a<00:04:22.950> great<00:04:23.370> detector<00:04:24.000> guys

00:04:24.969 --> 00:04:24.979 
dollars so it's a great detector guys

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.480 
dollars so it's a great detector guys
the<00:04:25.979> total<00:04:26.400> weight<00:04:26.610> on<00:04:26.849> it

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
the total weight on it

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.150 
the total weight on it
it's<00:04:27.610> two<00:04:27.910> point<00:04:28.210> five<00:04:28.419> pounds<00:04:28.810> she<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:29.860> swing

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.160 
it's two point five pounds she can swing

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.890 
it's two point five pounds she can swing
this<00:04:30.340> all<00:04:30.610> day<00:04:30.819> and<00:04:31.090> your<00:04:31.210> arms<00:04:31.539> will<00:04:31.600> never

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
this all day and your arms will never

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.550 
this all day and your arms will never
get<00:04:32.139> tired<00:04:32.819> it<00:04:33.819> has<00:04:34.060> three<00:04:34.870> positions<00:04:35.500> for

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
get tired it has three positions for

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.170 
get tired it has three positions for
your<00:04:35.740> cup<00:04:35.979> you<00:04:36.009> just<00:04:36.400> undo<00:04:36.699> that<00:04:36.819> screw<00:04:36.970> and

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
your cup you just undo that screw and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:41.249 
your cup you just undo that screw and
you<00:04:37.419> can<00:04:37.569> slide<00:04:37.870> it<00:04:38.020> back<00:04:38.520> or<00:04:39.520> forward<00:04:40.259> and

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
then it has three more adjustments on

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.159 
then it has three more adjustments on
the<00:04:43.150> coil<00:04:43.500> before<00:04:44.500> you<00:04:44.710> just<00:04:44.889> push<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:46.169> the

right here and one right here that you
can<00:04:52.539> go<00:04:52.870> into<00:04:53.139> so<00:04:54.870> um<00:04:57.030> it's<00:04:58.030> a<00:04:58.150> great<00:04:58.389> detector

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
can go into so um it's a great detector

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.200 
can go into so um it's a great detector
guys<00:04:59.139> and<00:04:59.470> I<00:04:59.500> recommend<00:04:59.800> it<00:05:00.160> to<00:05:00.400> thumbs<00:05:01.360> up<00:05:03.210> to

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.189 
guys and I recommend it to thumbs up to
prove<00:05:04.449> it<00:05:04.660> here's<00:05:04.870> some<00:05:04.930> of<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.289> things<00:05:07.199> these

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:08.199 
prove it here's some of the things these

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:21.180 
prove it here's some of the things these
are<00:05:08.259> not

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:29.680 

pesos<00:05:23.379> more<00:05:25.930> nice<00:05:26.930> time<00:05:27.319> right<00:05:27.680> here<00:05:28.690> I've

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
pesos more nice time right here I've

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.809 
pesos more nice time right here I've
I've<00:05:30.050> cleaned<00:05:30.349> all<00:05:30.620> these<00:05:30.949> well<00:05:31.250> most<00:05:31.490> of<00:05:31.669> them

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:31.819 
I've cleaned all these well most of them

00:05:31.819 --> 00:05:32.950 
I've cleaned all these well most of them
I<00:05:31.940> could<00:05:32.000> get<00:05:32.389> cleaned

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:32.960 
I could get cleaned

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:37.480 
I could get cleaned
looks<00:05:33.680> like<00:05:33.860> there's<00:05:35.259> these<00:05:36.259> three<00:05:37.099> right

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:37.490 
looks like there's these three right

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.159 
looks like there's these three right
here<00:05:37.729> they<00:05:37.909> found<00:05:38.210> all<00:05:38.389> right<00:05:38.659> next<00:05:38.870> to<00:05:39.080> each

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:39.169 
here they found all right next to each

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:41.040 
here they found all right next to each
other<00:05:39.379> and<00:05:39.590> they're<00:05:39.740> all<00:05:39.860> coated<00:05:40.159> really

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
other and they're all coated really

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.059 
other and they're all coated really
really<00:05:42.050> bad<00:05:42.259> I<00:05:42.289> should<00:05:42.620> say<00:05:44.289> it<00:05:45.289> does<00:05:45.500> find<00:05:45.979> a

00:05:46.059 --> 00:05:46.069 
really bad I should say it does find a

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:48.610 
really bad I should say it does find a
lot<00:05:46.250> of<00:05:46.370> bull<00:05:46.550> cows<00:05:46.789> but<00:05:47.210> it<00:05:47.539> stands<00:05:48.409> up<00:05:48.560> to

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
lot of bull cows but it stands up to
