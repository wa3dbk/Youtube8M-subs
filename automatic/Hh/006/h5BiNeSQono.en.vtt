00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.050
 U 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.280
 4 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:09.280
 Mine 

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:14.080
 Oh Oh Oh Oh 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:25.710
 The model you will test today is the BMW 520i 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.710
 232 model will be 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 U 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.180
 U 

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:41.650
 This model is made by Akriss bangle 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:47.440
 The existing oil-covered YouTube Kidney grill and 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:51.340
 The character of such a loose wa is represented by four round lights completely 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:56.020
 I will become a model that has changed innovatively. 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:01:02.830
 Toxic eyebrow headlights that remind us of eagles 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:09.190
 The whole line of these is a very breakthrough 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:11.530
 Brought a change in its design, but hobulho a lot during the public 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.050
 What kind of model is Galli ? 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:23.170
 But over time, I could feel the charm enough. 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:26.080
 Interior design is much more sophisticated than old 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:30.759
 Switches for various devices 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:32.110
 I can say that all of these things are definitely upgraded. 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:39.130
 There is 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:44.590
 And after this model, there is also a special upgrade for the model 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:50.440
 Because I do not have trust in what I see, 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:54.010
 I do not think I need to have dinner for a new model. 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:58.120
 This model also has 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.960
 The e-Shoba was stationed, 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:07.980
 bmw unique hard 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.980
 Because we are keeping such a characteristic of being aware of the road 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:17.310
 Such lower body characteristics will pull both satisfactory results of the characteristics of the engine and mission 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.220
 Out 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:28.200
 I think this car is practical and bmw specific 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:29.579
 And the evaluation of such a model that is not dissatisfied with the politics of various votes 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.950
 I'll do it 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.950
 So let's try to run slowly. 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.030
 You 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:21.250
 E-shop, too frozen to the bmw 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.890
 Not really any vendor 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:29.230
 Unsuitable 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:32.090
 Cream hair flying birds have had specific, and many people are down 5 else 

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.090
 You can not just following 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.090
 U 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 U 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:18.079
 The 520 model is extremely sporty due to its low body and engine mission characteristics. 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:26.130
 It's fun to drive, but the limit of 520 output is inevitable 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:31.680
 If you drive a vehicle in Musa search if so if it is sufficient 520 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:34.840
 Oh, if you are interested in running and have fun , 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:39.250
 I would recommend you choose 

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.480
 For example, the 520 232 model 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:49.420
 Practicality and Holy Spirit in every way 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:53.300
 And grab everything as a family sedan that gives a very satisfying 

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:56.380
 It shows all the values. 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.380
 Thank you.
