 from those 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:14.699
 the electric branch that goes from 11 to brown 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:19.669

 It has 52 steps at level 10 29 pedestrian corridors provides 382 service 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.490
 of daily trains with one train frequency every eight minutes during peak hours 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.249
 the economic crisis of previous years 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.029
 strongly harnessed all sectors and rail services were not 

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:53.690
 alien to the same 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 the consequences 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.169
 were quickly noted and that in terms of security and services 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:03.880
 in this situation 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.720
 demanded answers and within the development plan that is being carried out 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.490
 this government in railway matters 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.450
 the execution of a series of works is planned 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.400
 that respond to the problem generated by the growing demand for capacity 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:20.399
 transport 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.840
 the implementation of this solution is allowed 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.190
 in those accidents 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.860
 improve the frequency of travel binder a greater comfort 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.580
 and expand transportation capacity 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.460
 these works 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.760
 framed within the line project project a project that will contribute 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.270
 enormously to continue to improve the quality of life all of our 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.280
 community 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.050
 the works that comprise this project are 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.050
 burial from caballito to liniers 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.750
 this work 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.010
 will eliminate interference in the service 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.590
 eliminate barriers 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.290
 improve safety improve vehicular traffic 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.290
 and help revalue the adjacent properties 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.389
 closure of the operational area of ​​ideas 

00:02:20.389 --> 00:02:23.389
 until brown

 this opera prevents pedestrians from entering the area of ​​villas 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.599
 reduces accident 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:39.100
 and allows to prevent acts of vandalism, theft, theft and sabotage 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:42.100
 against railway installations 

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.650
 elimination of level crossings between liniers 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.650
 And brown 

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:04.439
 This work consists of the elimination of the 31 steps at the vehicular level 

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:09.189
 located along this stretch replacing them for approximately 20 

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:11.139
 adif crosses 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.040
 In parallel, this project is already undergoing new renovation works 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.039
 of tracks and cables in several sections of the route 

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.309
 important changes are being made to the rolling stock with 

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:34.040
 implementation of the first train 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:38.060
 double floor of the country that will come into operation at the beginning of the year 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.489

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:56.309
 higher circulation speed 

00:03:56.309 --> 00:04:01.329
 lower the transport capacity to consolidate a more comfortable trip 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:04.229
 for the passengers of these branches 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.309

 would be a great contribution to achieve the dream of all 

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.159
 that the train develops 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:42.059
 modernize and expand the train to be the pride of all
