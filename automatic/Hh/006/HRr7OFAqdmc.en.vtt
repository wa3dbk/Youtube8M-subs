red<00:01:04.799> sharp<00:01:05.129> edges<00:01:05.339> you'll<00:01:06.030> notice<00:01:06.299> that<00:01:06.420> this

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:07.250 
red sharp edges you'll notice that this

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.429 
red sharp edges you'll notice that this
side<00:01:08.250> is<00:01:08.280> bent<00:01:08.760> it's<00:01:09.450> actually<00:01:09.810> bent<00:01:10.080> right

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.830 
side is bent it's actually bent right
there<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.369> it's<00:01:11.580> easy<00:01:11.790> to<00:01:11.970> bend<00:01:12.180> these<00:01:12.360> cards

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there so it's easy to bend these cards

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.570 
there so it's easy to bend these cards
when<00:01:13.080> you<00:01:13.350> know<00:01:13.470> if<00:01:13.590> they<00:01:13.740> drop<00:01:14.040> the<00:01:14.189> boxes

and you know they obey well since the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.010 
and you know they obey well since the
best<00:01:31.290> side<00:01:31.500> is<00:01:31.650> down<00:01:31.799> there<00:01:32.100> if<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.970> drop<00:01:33.869> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
best side is down there if they drop the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
best side is down there if they drop the
box<00:01:34.200> like<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.640> obviously<00:01:35.640> you're<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:35.970> to
