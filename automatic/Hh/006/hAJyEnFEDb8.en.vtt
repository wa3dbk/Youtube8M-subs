00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.510
 Welcome to do it yourself 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.190
 inspiration 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.020
 in this video I introduce one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.580
 face mask or it is also one 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.160
 little facial peeling 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.759
 you can on the whole face 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.350
 Apply that gives moisture to the skin 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:18.750
 cleanses the skin and is also beautiful 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.359
 refreshing so maybe you have 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 I want to do it and I wanted it too 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.390
 give it a try 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 then just watch a video now 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.750
 needs sugar oatmeal olive oil and 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.579
 Lemon juice also has a container where 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.760
 Everything can be mixed together and 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.370
 a spoon first'll give you three 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.370
 tablespoons of olive oil in your container 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.160
 now comes a tablespoon 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:55.250
 oatmeal quietly such a heaped 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.250
 tablespoon and a tablespoon of sugar 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:10.909
 That's a good mix now 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.500
 shot lemon juice and calm 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.350
 a little more oatmeal where 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:30.800
 I take a second tablespoon again 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:32.810
 heaped and the whole drive well 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.820
 facial mask you can now quietly 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.679
 bit in the fridge stand up 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.869
 the oatmeal still a bit full 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:41.229
 and then you can do that 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.490
 just apply it all over your face 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.280
 Of course, it has to be careful 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.600
 relatively fluid best you lie down 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.850
 the whole thing lasts ten minutes 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.830
 the skin and then want thoroughly 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.090
 and it can be easy 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.550
 massaging face it 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.009
 that is also the sugar with it in the 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.540
 It's not a light feeling, either 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.840
 a bit of facial mask and peeling 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:08.390
 in a very careful and massage 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.140
 then just with lukewarm water again 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:11.930
 wash 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:16.220
 this face mask or face 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:19.010
 Peeling cleanses the skin gives dry 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.200
 Moisturizes and moisturizes the skin 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.150
 but also with nutrients so 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.890
 really had many advantages 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.750
 you can try it once and in 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.790
 the comments write like it with you 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.769

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.750
 if you can recommend it so 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.239
