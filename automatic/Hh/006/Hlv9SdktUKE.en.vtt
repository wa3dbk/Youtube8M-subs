 just when I went to what was 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.060

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.110
 full we have ammo instants 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.940

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.450
 this I do not know how that is it makes me have a 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.010
 little more damage or maybe not not true 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:49.840
 increases what is the damage because of the 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:52.420
 big ones use toxic tests we have 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.670

 ammunition of the distant future ok a 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.450

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.490
 future says with the technology of the future 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.500

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.090
 ammunition capacity go come 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.000
 pretty good for you already remember 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.980
 minds the character is super 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.080
 and well, this gives a bit of 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.700
 plus a little better to have a 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.140
 little more ammunition we have here 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.820

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.440

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.020
 characters the soldiers are what most 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.700
 I like them I think they are the most 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.800
 balanced as those that take you out 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.660

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:47.160
 the game so guys we have obtained 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.870
