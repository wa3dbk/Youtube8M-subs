stuff<00:03:49.380> actually<00:03:49.709> you<00:03:50.700> had<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:50.970> put<00:03:51.150> together

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
stuff actually you had to put together

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.690 
stuff actually you had to put together
now<00:03:51.870> let's<00:03:52.110> stick<00:03:52.350> that<00:03:52.560> missile<00:03:52.980> right<00:03:53.459> back

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:53.700 
now let's stick that missile right back

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.880 
now let's stick that missile right back
in<00:03:53.910> there<00:03:54.120> so<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.959> can't<00:03:55.350> take<00:03:55.560> that<00:03:55.680> out<00:03:55.739> and

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
in there so you can't take that out and

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.380 
in there so you can't take that out and
you<00:03:56.040> can<00:03:56.250> have<00:03:56.400> them<00:03:56.519> walk<00:03:56.730> around<00:03:57.090> with<00:03:57.239> that

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
you can have them walk around with that

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.300 
you can have them walk around with that
if<00:03:57.660> you<00:03:57.810> really<00:03:58.079> want<00:03:58.290> this<00:03:58.769> doesn't<00:03:59.190> do

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
if you really want this doesn't do

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.310 
if you really want this doesn't do
anything<00:03:59.670> I<00:03:59.790> mean<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.060> just<00:04:00.180> rolls<00:04:00.540> you<00:04:01.290> can

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:01.320 
anything I mean it just rolls you can

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.190 
anything I mean it just rolls you can
see<00:04:01.769> that<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.160> top<00:04:02.370> section<00:04:02.820> here<00:04:02.850> does<00:04:03.780> open

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:04.200 
see that the top section here does open

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:06.440 
see that the top section here does open
so<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.799> can<00:04:04.980> have<00:04:05.130> a<00:04:05.160> turtle<00:04:05.640> actually<00:04:06.090> come

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
so you can have a turtle actually come

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.630 
so you can have a turtle actually come
up<00:04:06.630> you<00:04:06.930> know<00:04:06.959> let's<00:04:07.200> let's<00:04:07.530> take<00:04:07.739> Donatello

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
this section right here let's take

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.850 
this section right here let's take
Raphael<00:05:10.550> for<00:05:10.760> example<00:05:11.180> hold<00:05:12.080> this<00:05:12.260> then<00:05:12.740> you

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
Raphael for example hold this then you

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.000 
Raphael for example hold this then you
take<00:05:13.100> this<00:05:13.390> it's<00:05:14.390> like<00:05:14.540> that<00:05:14.570> in<00:05:14.900> then<00:05:15.410> rotate

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
take this it's like that in then rotate

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.400 
take this it's like that in then rotate
this<00:05:16.280> it<00:05:16.850> says<00:05:17.150> to<00:05:17.330> rotate<00:05:17.810> it<00:05:17.930> around<00:05:18.020> about

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
this it says to rotate it around about

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:21.370 
this it says to rotate it around about
four<00:05:19.250> or<00:05:19.370> five<00:05:19.550> times<00:05:19.880> I<00:05:20.210> do<00:05:20.270> it<00:05:20.420> so<00:05:20.690> once<00:05:21.290> you

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
four or five times I do it so once you

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.940 
four or five times I do it so once you
start<00:05:21.470> hearing<00:05:21.800> it<00:05:21.950> click<00:05:23.080> that's<00:05:24.080> just<00:05:24.800> like

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:24.950 
start hearing it click that's just like

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:27.400 
start hearing it click that's just like
that<00:05:25.160> kind<00:05:25.910> of<00:05:26.000> do<00:05:26.210> it<00:05:26.360> about<00:05:26.750> like<00:05:27.050> so<00:05:27.290> and

that kind of do it about like so and

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.680 
that kind of do it about like so and
then<00:05:27.530> take<00:05:27.740> this<00:05:27.950> push<00:05:28.820> this<00:05:29.000> all<00:05:29.330> the<00:05:29.450> way<00:05:29.540> in

then take this push this all the way in

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.420 
then take this push this all the way in
here<00:05:29.840> let<00:05:29.990> me<00:05:30.050> get<00:05:30.200> this<00:05:30.290> arm<00:05:30.590> straight<00:05:30.740> push

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
here let me get this arm straight push

this<00:05:53.420> is<00:05:53.480> a<00:05:53.630> spring-loaded<00:05:54.080> thing<00:05:54.680> that<00:05:55.340> you

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 
this is a spring-loaded thing that you

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:59.080 
this is a spring-loaded thing that you
just<00:05:55.820> rotate<00:05:56.210> this<00:05:56.390> around<00:05:56.570> just<00:05:57.610> like<00:05:58.610> so<00:05:58.880> and

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
just rotate this around just like so and

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.270 
just rotate this around just like so and
you<00:05:59.540> can<00:05:59.690> see<00:05:59.900> that<00:06:00.050> I<00:06:00.110> mean<00:06:00.380> it<00:06:00.680> lets<00:06:00.920> it<00:06:01.070> go<00:06:01.250> I

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:01.280 
you can see that I mean it lets it go I

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.890 
you can see that I mean it lets it go I
mean<00:06:01.490> it's<00:06:01.610> all<00:06:01.730> spring-loaded<00:06:02.360> like<00:06:02.570> I<00:06:02.600> say

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
mean it's all spring-loaded like I say

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:05.830 
mean it's all spring-loaded like I say
but<00:06:03.110> when<00:06:03.290> you<00:06:03.380> put<00:06:03.650> it<00:06:03.770> in<00:06:03.920> here<00:06:04.300> it<00:06:05.300> holds<00:06:05.720> in

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:05.840 
but when you put it in here it holds in

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:07.150 
but when you put it in here it holds in
because<00:06:06.170> you<00:06:06.320> can<00:06:06.500> see<00:06:06.710> that<00:06:06.890> there's<00:06:07.100> a

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.160 
because you can see that there's a

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:09.700 
because you can see that there's a
little<00:06:07.580> foot<00:06:07.910> section<00:06:08.420> that<00:06:08.930> his<00:06:09.110> foots<00:06:09.440> kind

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
little foot section that his foots kind

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:12.070

of<00:06:09.800> hitting<00:06:10.040> on<00:06:10.160> and<00:06:10.400> then<00:06:10.910> this<00:06:11.450> pushes<00:06:11.960> the

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
of hitting on and then this pushes the

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.660 
of hitting on and then this pushes the
door<00:06:12.260> open<00:06:12.590> so<00:06:12.740> I'll<00:06:12.800> just<00:06:12.980> leaving<00:06:13.280> it<00:06:13.400> open

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:13.670

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:17.020 
door open so I'll just leaving it open
and<00:06:13.790> then<00:06:13.880> pushing<00:06:14.270> on<00:06:14.480> this<00:06:14.600> button<00:06:15.820> he<00:06:16.820> just

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.030 
and then pushing on this button he just

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.390 
and then pushing on this button he just
comes<00:06:17.270> out<00:06:17.420> spinning<00:06:18.020> which<00:06:18.200> is<00:06:18.410> absolutely
