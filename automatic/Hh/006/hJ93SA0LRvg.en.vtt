00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.220
 to his transparent brawn presents 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.170
 and read that they stick 

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:18.100
 here we are for the professor silvina 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:18.100
 Busquets 

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:26.240
 it still does not force black subject much 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:28.880
 good today a job this cute cute 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:34.990
 very decorative very decorative and very 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.990
 practical and theses that I really 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.690
 good is a face that is very simple 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.150
 that is nice work with what it was is 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:50.990
 the purina caixa if the so cute total 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.550
 it's good to give it another wave and to see 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.520
 that you can do nice things with 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.920
 paper we remember them this way is in 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.930
 the number 12 would be that it is already in the 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.240
 kiosks so lose it because it's 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.980
 when other projects very nice that 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.119
 you can go to the magazine and see if you 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.180
 lacked something good you can find 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.549
 they absolutely hear you good very well 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.439
 Well how are you doing then welcome to 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.299
 we're all going to do this way that 

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:16.100
 It really is very simple and easy to 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.530
 do for nothing in principle what I do 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.640
 let's use journal paper as 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.770
 I always use that they are 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.180
 of paper in this case I cut the 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.409
 half but good actually the sheet 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.909
 to make it longer the strip 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.860
 we would have to use the whole if the 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.619
 whole the diary then what are we going to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.350
 do we fold the paper what 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.600
 we do is pretty much double as well 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.140
 about two centimeters and let's go 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.090
 sticking until we manage to fold everything and 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.920
 that we have a strip when we arrived 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.830
 In the end, what I'm going to do is take a 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.240
 little bit of vinyl cola we're going to pass you 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.720
 well to the whole strip and we paste and we 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.490
 the strip is well done 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.899
 so this way we're going to do some 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.360
 how many because for this way we are going to 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.740
 need about 15 strips then 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.660
 Once they 're ready, I'll 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.330
 I have here, we are going to place the 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.670
 first I to make the base of this 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.369
 basket I used for example in this case 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.070
 I'm going to put five strips like this in this 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.019
 position if vertically and I'm going to 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:17.870
 take another five strips that I'm going to 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.550
 crisscross horizontally like 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.290
 we do we are going to interbreed with the 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.019
 basic or common interlacing of the 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.340
 basketry that is to go passing a strip by 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.379
 up one x 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.290
 of the other above the one that follows 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:33.110
 below like that of the next one and by 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.819
 above the other if I take another more than 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.500
 I'll have the same but the other way around 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.170
 interlaced that is if here it goes through 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.450
 up here went up in this part 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.450
 this is going to go under then 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:46.540
 we passed like this 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.330
 and the last one I'm going to pass this way 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.670
 way and we will go accommodating so that 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.060
 this is one or join because I want 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.800
 achieve a base there is like that then 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.290
 I will go lifting for example in this 

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:01.690
 case I'm going to lift these two because it's going 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:06.519
 to go just like the first one I'm going to place 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:08.349
 another one that I raise these three so they see 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:10.239
 how easy is simple they have to go 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:12.250
 looking that the previous one does not match 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:13.959
 that the two that do not stay past me 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.049
 the same but I stayed upside down that the 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:19.450
 previous I raise these other two and already 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.390
 is to see we have five and five of each 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.540
 side and I already achieved the base of the basket in 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:28.030
 this case have to look yes this 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.920
 is going to be the base of the basket so this 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.660
 part that is here is going to be the lateral or 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.970
 the height yes yes I like this 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.340
 We are going to leave it this way 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.810
 then once I have achieved the base I 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:39.220
 I could keep adding for this side and 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.290
 for this side of making a basket a 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.030
 little bigger if I want to leave it like that 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.980
 I'm going to grab one of the strips and I'm going to 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.540
 start cutting a little more girls 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.790
 because because what I'm going to do now 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.340
 it's just to intertwine 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:53.379
 each side separately then by 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.569
 example I want between the edges I'll 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:00.019
 spend like this I will spend like this 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:02.160
 and so in this way only this side I follow 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.950
 with this I go like this 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.650
 I go like this and I'm going to keep intertwining 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.730
 amount that I want to achieve 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.209
 height of the basket 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:16.630
 well once then I did this 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:18.430
 same on the four sides we are going to 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.829
 paste the edges with which we are going to paste 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.930
 we are going to hit, we are going to hit with supra 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:24.729
 transparent bond if this sticks 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.130
 perfect is not going to move work 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.770
 for nothing and we're going to make sure we stay 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.650
 really well and that does not disarm in 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.389
 No moment of our work 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.949
 then I will do it in each one 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.190
 of the tips or the edges I will go 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:42.160
 placing some glue so that 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:45.699
 I was perfect for example here I go to 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.669
 go placing here in this part in all 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:51.160
 in all the edges we will go placing 

00:04:48.669 --> 00:04:53.979
 the glue to have a job 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.320
 really barbaric that once with what 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:58.270
 what's left over with transparent in everything we give 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.789
 back and we hit the other side 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 then this I'm going to run 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.300
 let's leave it here I'm going to 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.010
 accommodate a little bit down here so that 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.410
 you see how I have left once 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.289
 everything is already stuck and everything between the 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:12.760
 blood are intertwined and so all the 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:15.130
 good tips 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:17.620
 once I did this we are going to take the 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:20.290
 scissors and we're going to cut all the excess 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.020
 and we are going to cut well flush so that 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.360
 everything is so neat 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:28.160
 there it is once then that already 

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.259
 we cut and everything was neat 

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:32.419
 let's paint right now we paint 

00:05:30.259 --> 00:05:35.150
 I painted it a dark brown 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:37.039
 which is a water-based varnish 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.870
 tan color that left me with that 

00:05:37.039 --> 00:05:41.810
 perfect because it gave me color and could 

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:42.409
 seal the work and I will stay 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.039
 A) Yes 

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:48.020
 thus this way des 

00:05:46.039 --> 00:05:50.210
 with this type of painting appears 

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.039
 really like it's a leather or a 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.500
 hill once I did this that is 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:56.539
 all painted I'll take for example a 

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:59.780
 tool so it's a machine 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.639
 generator so I did with this 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.849
 creative what I did was to drill do 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:06.830
 Look perforations going to see here in 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.259
 each of the sides in this case 

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:11.870
 I made three on one side I made three on the other 

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:14.030
 I also did three in this part and so on 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:16.250
 each of the edges once 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:18.289
 we did all the drilling I'm going to 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.780
 do the termination the termination the 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.699
 I did with the tape well I took a tape 

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:24.020
 well in color also brown yes 

00:06:22.699 --> 00:06:25.190
 they want can take a color that is 

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:27.379
 contrast that will also be 

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.070
 cute and what we do we also come back to 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:33.960
 drink 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:40.470
 We will place well on the entire edge if 

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:42.000
 in this part here and here if once 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:44.310
 that we place the shadow with transparent 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.220
 what we do is take the tape well yo 

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:51.720
 first, double it to the middle and what 

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:53.700
 we do is paste like this around this 

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.160
 edge once we paste a side 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:58.350
 we do the same thing from the back side and we 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.630
 will be perfectly well stuck 

00:06:58.350 --> 00:07:02.970
 just like this is and to finish 

00:07:00.630 --> 00:07:05.100
 you can for example take crashes 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:07.920
 take or a thread that is a cord 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:09.240
 suede that we are going to go through the 

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:11.460
 perforations we made with some 

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.650
 ties is cute and ready can 

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.510
 do it with another color also clear to 

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:17.190
 lorca rum that after is already comfortable 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.530
 of each one and as he does not want to decorate 

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:22.970
 ways is also so good I 

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.970
 I painted for this door 

00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:36.150
 everyone who decides and who sees 

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:39.110
 what does seem also very practical 

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.110
 Thank you 

00:07:39.710 --> 00:07:45.539
 now we continue with carolina giavedoni 

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:49.969
 from the province of córdoba that is going to 

00:07:45.539 --> 00:07:49.969
 be an asthma many cases of pumpkins
