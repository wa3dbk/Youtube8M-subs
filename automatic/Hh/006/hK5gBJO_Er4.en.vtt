00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.800
 my name is ana isabel corner i am 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:09.080
 midwife since this year that finished the 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.510
 residency I created the blog planner 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:12.889
 because I called plan and go because a 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.200
 goal is in a plan it's just a wish 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.330
 That is the phrase of Saint ExupÃ©ry with the 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.460
 that I studied the air and had it very 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.929
 clear that a goal without a plan is a 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.269
 desire and that you had to fight for it 

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:25.009
 I decided to create the blog afterwards when 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.259
 I finished the residency and I already had a 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.999
 A little more time with the function of 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:30.679
 accompany students who are 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:32.329
 preparing this exam is directed 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.040
 fundamentally to the people who are 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:35.210
 wants to prepare exams but also 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.380
 is open to everyone who is 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.730
 interested in the specialization of 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.710
 nursing because many times what 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.630
 I also make a claim to try 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.160
 make our profession visible and that everything 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.260
 world that is interested in defending it 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.000
 so you can participate in fact one of 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.010
 the most important parts for me in the 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.990
 blog are going to be comments is something 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.940
 I want it to be interactive, I'm going 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.350
 doing post chronologically in 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.060
 function of all the novelties that go 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.460
 arising in the air test after attempt 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:59.990
 give the data that I know are from 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.180
 interest for them and that at that time 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.380
 they will be trusted because this 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180
 blog at the end of what it is about is 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.430
 bring confidence that I think is the 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.870
 weak point that the opponent has and a 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.500
 of the things that I have pending 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.510
 to post 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.980
 also in the blog is the new 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.540
 application that I created for the 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.670
 preparation of the exam that is going to 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 call simulation follow the function more 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.180
 important that will have that application 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.380
 is that we will be able to compare is 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.790
 say that the application is going to tell you in 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.770
 what position have you left with respect to 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.720
 rest of the students one of the 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.070
 options that I have on the blog is a 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.350
 clock that is marking the time that 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.850
 is for the exam but that is not 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.229
 try to overwhelm and think what I 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.510
 is left to study because in fact what 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.850
 that I put down is two months left and 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.410
 three days to be a resident my advice 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:40.850
 final for students who love each other 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.770
 prepare read is that really that 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.479
 trust them to be cured 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.020
 much in which that is happening or is 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.020
 take the square 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.799
 no no no
