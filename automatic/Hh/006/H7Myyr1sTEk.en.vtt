00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.920
 teacher in which she explains all the 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.610
 Keyboard features 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:54.600
 since this keyboard is configurable 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.340
 because it has macros has a software in 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.689
 which we can configure the profiles 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.600
 of user 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.310
 we see the gold-plated cable what 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.720
 improves conductivity and 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.540
 keyboard connectivity 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.399
 we see that even to be 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:13.280
 Backlit 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.670
 the keys are even seen being 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.799
 off which is quite strange of 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.470
 see are usually keys that are 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:24.049
 shutdowns that do not have the letters 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.290
 recorded that you only see when you're 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:32.330
 backlit on keyboard we see the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:36.650
 more specific programmable keys 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.660
 dmm and macro keys standars fine ya 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.520
 we have turned off the lights now 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.580
 we will show the backlight is 

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.150
 quite special so we will have 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.239
 what 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.220
 they showed it for quite a while already 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.220
 which has many colors 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.510
 we have to go from color to color 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.180
 since we do not have it configured to 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.480
 through software redo 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.730
 we have to show it by passing it and 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.319
 going through all the colors 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.590
 we see that below they light up after 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:13.969
 redo the color in concrete that 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.969
 let's have a place 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:21.100
 has the whole rgb scale we see that the 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:23.740
 backlighting is perfect 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.940
 the illuminated keyboard is not below 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:30.450
 only the letter in particular that we are 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.450
 retro lighting 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:35.659
 we show it in green 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.400
 we see that it is also changing color 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:41.840
 since we do not have it configured and 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:43.879
 comes with the pre configuration 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.680
 we see that they have gaming mode so 

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.640
 the windows key is also 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.640
 blocked right now 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.100
 some excellent matt finishes with 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:59.100
 antique ting and anti-skid keys 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.870
 profile configuration is on the 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.270
 flight so we can do it 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.760
 while we play 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.570
