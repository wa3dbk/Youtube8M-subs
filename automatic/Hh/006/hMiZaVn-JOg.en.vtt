00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
the server with everyone that we always

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.859 
the server with everyone that we always
playing<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.369> party<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.030> it<00:01:09.150> might<00:01:09.270> kicked<00:01:09.570> into

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
playing a party and it might kicked into

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.440 
playing a party and it might kicked into
theater<00:01:10.200> mode<00:01:10.409> my<00:01:10.770> pen<00:01:10.979> five<00:01:11.220> minutes<00:01:11.520> my<00:01:12.210> eyes

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
theater mode my pen five minutes my eyes

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.710 
theater mode my pen five minutes my eyes
31<00:01:13.320> I<00:01:13.830> end<00:01:14.520> up<00:01:14.580> on<00:01:14.729> a<00:01:14.820> screen<00:01:15.060> with<00:01:15.360> like<00:01:15.570> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
31 I end up on a screen with like a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
31 I end up on a screen with like a
checkup<00:01:16.110> chessboard<00:01:17.009> sort<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.430> thing<00:01:17.549> yeah<00:01:17.790> is

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
checkup chessboard sort of thing yeah is

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.510 
checkup chessboard sort of thing yeah is
it<00:01:18.570> is<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> mode<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.560> occasionally<00:01:20.070> random

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
it is a mode and occasionally random

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.789 
it is a mode and occasionally random
people<00:01:20.790> in<00:01:20.909> them<00:01:21.060> or<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.780> just<00:01:22.140> get<00:01:22.350> kicked<00:01:22.619> on

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
people in them or I just get kicked on

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.859 
people in them or I just get kicked on
to<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> loading<00:01:23.100> screen<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.759> my<00:01:23.909> ps3<00:01:24.240> freezers

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
to a loading screen or my ps3 freezers

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.310 
to a loading screen or my ps3 freezers
but<00:01:25.500> uh<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:26.009> assume<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.330> that<00:01:27.570> will<00:01:27.810> be<00:01:28.020> fixed

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
but uh I assume that that will be fixed

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.039 
but uh I assume that that will be fixed
I'm<00:01:29.100> hoping<00:01:29.430> today<00:01:29.549> because<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.810> all<00:01:30.930> the

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I'm hoping today because the all the

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.590 
I'm hoping today because the all the
other<00:01:31.200> games<00:01:31.409> were<00:01:31.740> terrible<00:01:32.189> at<00:01:32.610> first<00:01:32.970> like

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
other games were terrible at first like

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.200 
other games were terrible at first like
that<00:01:33.840> yeah<00:01:34.320> so<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:34.860> guess<00:01:35.159> that's<00:01:35.610> not<00:01:36.150> really

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
that yeah so I guess that's not really

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.999 
that yeah so I guess that's not really
something<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.869> worry<00:01:37.020> about<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.409> more<00:01:37.770> fair<00:01:37.890> to

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
something to worry about it more fair to

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.039 
something to worry about it more fair to
crash<00:01:38.310> on<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.729> first<00:01:38.939> day<00:01:39.150> like<00:01:39.329> couple<00:01:39.810> hours

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
crash on the first day like couple hours

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.539 
crash on the first day like couple hours
oh<00:01:40.170> yeah<00:01:40.490> we<00:01:41.490> had<00:01:41.610> the<00:01:41.700> crown<00:01:41.939> coral<00:01:42.600> or<00:01:43.549> I'll

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
oh yeah we had the crown coral or I'll

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.490

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
when I first place called g4 it took me

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.830 
when I first place called g4 it took me
40<00:01:46.979> minutes<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.310> get<00:01:47.460> my<00:01:47.520> first<00:01:47.909> game<00:01:48.119> happy
