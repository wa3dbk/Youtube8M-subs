00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.420
 welcome to st tropez so we live 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.880
 from the camp of the lodges with thiago on the right 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.529
 isaac at best and anthony left bottom 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.090
 hello the share of pg tickets has 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.180
 started that tiago so how is going 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.539
 this beginning of season with the jersey of the 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.539
 paris saint germain 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:35.040
 what is difficult to agree to 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.770
 marco v raking the counterexample to him 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.710
 which shows precisely that we can 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.969
 succeed by being small so how does that 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:47.640
 is happening this week the workout 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:50.100
 what was the program this morning okay 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.600
 and so with a second workout 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.949
 this afternoon I presume as every 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.219
 Tuesdays it's not too complicated to train 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.449
 twice in the day 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.530
 okay last weekend so 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.730
 apparently you go you played dh 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:05.299
 how was the match against 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:09.000
 brétigny good ya not peril in the house 

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.790
 ok isaac so baky new club I think 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.979
 so you come straight 2 2 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.689
 montpellier so you left your accent 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.189
 wheel all because they already have you by 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.570
 Parisian told me I have so good then 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.950
 the different centers of montpellier 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.210
 hérault or what were you in the area 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.860
 montpellier tt why not I 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.259
 believe the differences between regions 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.520
 of Montpellier and Paris 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.060
 the culture shock it's not too much 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.560
 important it's okay so I play in d1 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.400
 in 15 dh also last weekend 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.090
 how was this match in 17 years 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.759
 as much for me 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.570
 in 17 dh so how was this 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.570
 meet 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.350
 we lost 2 1 but it went well 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.350
 so its debut season automatisms 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:02.299
 for you you see in which post middle 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:04.829

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:09.780

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.170

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.000

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.920
 that's it and then associated with school in 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.709
 it's not always obvious 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:19.230
 little month two months and after it's good 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:21.239

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:27.140
