the same between the classic and the GS
okay<00:00:11.389> just<00:00:12.389> step<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:12.690> no<00:00:13.080> still<00:00:13.920> wrong<00:00:14.389> just

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
pull the pin out and it's easiest to

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.140 
pull the pin out and it's easiest to
knock<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.019> pin<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.439> with<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.189> caliper

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
Pistons back in the brake pads that

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.390 
Pistons back in the brake pads that
Artyom<00:01:49.180> is<00:01:49.300> taken<00:01:49.630> out<00:01:49.750> are<00:01:50.130> actually<00:01:51.130> only

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
Artyom is taken out are actually only

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.310 
Artyom is taken out are actually only
about<00:01:51.520> half<00:01:51.970> of<00:01:52.119> their<00:01:52.270> wear<00:01:52.540> limit<00:01:52.930> but<00:01:53.080> he

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
about half of their wear limit but he

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.710 
about half of their wear limit but he
doesn't<00:01:53.950> like<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.520> feel<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.000> those<00:01:55.240> pads<00:01:55.479> so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
doesn't like the feel of those pads so

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.180 
doesn't like the feel of those pads so
he<00:01:55.869> wants<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.140> change<00:01:56.410> them<00:01:56.590> if<00:01:56.740> you<00:01:56.860> look<00:01:57.040> at

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
he wants to change them if you look at

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:58.889 
he wants to change them if you look at
the<00:01:57.310> groove<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:57.790> the<00:01:57.820> brake<00:01:58.090> pad<00:01:58.330> if<00:01:58.840> you

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
the groove in the brake pad if you

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.749 
the groove in the brake pad if you
cannot<00:01:59.320> see<00:01:59.649> that<00:01:59.830> groove<00:02:00.160> then<00:02:00.430> your<00:02:00.550> brake

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:00.759 
cannot see that groove then your brake

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:02.600 
cannot see that groove then your brake
pads<00:02:00.910> are<00:02:01.149> definitely<00:02:01.570> need<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.050> be<00:02:02.140> replaced

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
pads are definitely need to be replaced

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.130 
pads are definitely need to be replaced
you<00:02:03.610> want<00:02:03.790> to<00:02:03.850> put<00:02:03.970> the<00:02:04.060> pad<00:02:04.270> in<00:02:04.479> that<00:02:04.960> goes

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
you want to put the pad in that goes

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.180 
you want to put the pad in that goes
against<00:02:05.830> the<00:02:06.600> Pistons<00:02:07.600> first<00:02:08.170> and<00:02:08.500> then<00:02:09.009> put

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
against the Pistons first and then put

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:18.589 
against the Pistons first and then put
the<00:02:09.280> other<00:02:09.310> pad<00:02:09.670> in

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:28.190 

and<00:02:19.290> then<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.829> pin<00:02:20.040> is<00:02:20.159> going<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.370> go<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:27.200> we

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and then the pin is going to go in we

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.020 
and then the pin is going to go in we
spread<00:02:28.469> a<00:02:28.499> little<00:02:28.620> bit<00:02:28.739> of<00:02:28.889> wd-40<00:02:29.489> on<00:02:29.609> the<00:02:29.790> pin

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
spread a little bit of wd-40 on the pin

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.739 
spread a little bit of wd-40 on the pin
to<00:02:30.450> clean<00:02:30.719> it<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.019> now<00:02:31.579> putting<00:02:32.579> just<00:02:33.150> a<00:02:33.389> light

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:33.749 
to clean it and now putting just a light

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:36.500 
to clean it and now putting just a light
coat<00:02:34.139> of<00:02:34.260> grease<00:02:34.469> on<00:02:34.709> here<00:02:35.180> because<00:02:36.180> the<00:02:36.299> pads

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
coat of grease on here because the pads

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.099 
coat of grease on here because the pads
are<00:02:36.689> going<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.579> move<00:02:38.579> on<00:02:38.849> that<00:02:39.000> pin<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.659> the

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:40.109 
are going to move on that pin and the

00:02:40.109 --> 00:02:41.509 
are going to move on that pin and the
pin<00:02:40.139> won't<00:02:40.469> wear<00:02:40.620> so<00:02:40.799> much<00:02:40.980> it<00:02:41.189> just<00:02:41.219> has<00:02:41.489> a

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
pin won't wear so much it just has a

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:48.229 
pin won't wear so much it just has a
little<00:02:41.700> bit<00:02:41.879> of<00:02:41.969> grease<00:02:46.669> okay<00:02:47.669> so<00:02:47.730> now<00:02:47.939> the<00:02:47.999> pin

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:48.239 
little bit of grease okay so now the pin

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:53.599 
little bit of grease okay so now the pin
slides<00:02:48.599> in<00:02:49.159> and<00:02:50.510> and<00:02:51.510> drives<00:02:51.959> home<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.609> then

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
slides in and and drives home and then

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:55.909 
slides in and and drives home and then
the<00:02:53.700> clip<00:02:53.909> goes<00:02:54.090> in<00:02:54.359> if<00:02:54.569> the<00:02:55.530> hole<00:02:55.680> is<00:02:55.709> not

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:55.919 
the clip goes in if the hole is not

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:58.819 
the clip goes in if the hole is not
showing<00:02:56.299> the<00:02:57.299> pins<00:02:58.109> got<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.379> be<00:02:58.439> knocked<00:02:58.650> in

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
showing the pins got to be knocked in

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.920 
showing the pins got to be knocked in
further<00:02:59.159> but<00:02:59.849> that<00:02:59.879> little<00:03:00.329> that<00:03:00.689> could<00:03:00.870> be

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
further but that little that could be

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.929 
further but that little that could be
done<00:03:01.049> after<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:01.799> calipers<00:03:02.219> back<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.609> the<00:03:02.699> bike

00:03:02.929 --> 00:03:02.939 
done after the calipers back on the bike

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.860 
done after the calipers back on the bike
just<00:03:03.569> don't<00:03:03.780> forget<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.889> at<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.189> point<00:03:05.870> he's

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
just don't forget and at this point he's

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:22.430 
just don't forget and at this point he's
stuck<00:03:07.169> pry<00:03:07.769> on<00:03:07.799> the<00:03:08.930> the<00:03:09.930> pads

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.480 

now<00:03:23.440> just<00:03:24.070> one<00:03:24.520> drop<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:24.790> Loctite<00:03:25.390> on<00:03:25.570> the<00:03:25.900> end

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
now just one drop a Loctite on the end

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
back again the pin goes in and you want

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.420 
back again the pin goes in and you want
to<00:04:17.600> make<00:04:17.690> sure<00:04:17.870> that<00:04:18.079> the<00:04:18.229> curved<00:04:18.590> end<00:04:18.769> of<00:04:19.370> the

to make sure that the curved end of the

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:27.370 
to make sure that the curved end of the
pin<00:04:19.669> faces<00:04:20.660> the<00:04:20.780> caliper<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:26.200> that's<00:04:27.200> all

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
pin faces the caliper and that's all

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:28.990 
pin faces the caliper and that's all
there<00:04:27.530> is<00:04:27.650> to<00:04:28.010> changing<00:04:28.040> the<00:04:28.639> front<00:04:28.760> brake

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
there is to changing the front brake

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.990 
there is to changing the front brake
pads<00:04:29.240> other<00:04:29.600> than<00:04:29.810> maybe<00:04:30.080> bleeding<00:04:30.500> them

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
pads other than maybe bleeding them

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000
