00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.360
 once united 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.580
 When we have downloaded, we will go to 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:14.080
 the folders that have been downloaded 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.290

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.630
 first file the first error there is or 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.880
 then once he had removed the 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.580
 first a folder will be created and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:26.800
 Of course , we will not always create a 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.780
 iso image which we with the 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.900
 program called daemon tools 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.470
 simon tools start we are in a video 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.690
 please which we with the one of 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.210
 montull is very simple what we will do 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.350
 we will copy this from the bar 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:48.970
 directions we'll go here we see the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:50.869
 address bar we will put this and 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:53.750
 we will select the image and I am 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.320
 We will open and clear as always 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.850
 will come out an installer all that and until now 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.670
 we will have our walking says in 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.740
 Spanish totally free I have to 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.789
 say that I recommend buying the game already 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.350
 that is a game that deserves 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.940
 very much worth it but of course this 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.100
 I go up for people who do not have 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.080
 money to download it to get it 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.569
 uy what position of qantas I am already 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.510
 badly left in the video I'm sorry and 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:19.340
 Well, it's just for that 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.840
 because the translations of this 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.640
 videogames are not very good are 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:23.810
 reliable translations but they are not very 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.100
 good 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.980
 so I always recommend buying 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.810
 the video game and more if it's a video game 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.040
 as good as the walking dead if there 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.510
