Steve<00:02:05.189> and<00:02:05.939> Paul<00:02:06.210> Williams<00:02:06.509> would<00:02:06.780> be<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:06.899> poor

Steve and Paul Williams would be a poor

natural market for those guys I
I<00:02:13.800> personally<00:02:14.460> think<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.700> fight<00:02:15.120> would<00:02:15.270> have

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
I personally think that fight would have

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
I personally think that fight would have
been<00:02:15.480> one<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.810> might<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.050> don't<00:02:16.230> feel

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
been one that might have don't feel

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:18.620 
been one that might have don't feel
better<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.830> Vegas<00:02:17.250> but<00:02:17.460> you<00:02:17.700> know<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.270> it<00:02:18.510> is

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
better in Vegas but you know as it is

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.260 
better in Vegas but you know as it is
you<00:02:19.350> know<00:02:19.500> it's<00:02:19.890> just<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:21.030> know<00:02:21.060> you

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
know it was going on and let me say this

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.380 
know it was going on and let me say this
for<00:02:43.920> people<00:02:44.250> who<00:02:44.340> don't<00:02:44.550> know<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.910> know<00:02:45.120> if

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
for people who don't know you know if

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.510 
for people who don't know you know if
you<00:02:45.510> go<00:02:45.720> back<00:02:45.960> let's<00:02:46.230> go<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:46.500> into<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:46.950> 1980s

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:47.520 
you go back let's go to into the 1980s

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:49.310 
you go back let's go to into the 1980s
because<00:02:47.790> that<00:02:48.270> was<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.510> last<00:02:48.720> time<00:02:48.960> the<00:02:49.140> box

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
because that was the last time the box

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:51.650 
because that was the last time the box
was<00:02:49.620> really<00:02:50.100> vibrant<00:02:50.370> and<00:02:50.760> big<00:02:50.970> I<00:02:51.180> think

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
was really vibrant and big I think

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.090 
was really vibrant and big I think
there's<00:02:51.810> a<00:02:51.900> lot<00:02:52.020> of<00:02:52.080> good<00:02:52.290> things<00:02:52.440> going<00:02:52.590> on<00:02:52.920> in

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
there's a lot of good things going on in

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.220 
there's a lot of good things going on in
boxing<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:53.850> hardly<00:02:54.690> want<00:02:54.900> to<00:02:54.960> say<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
boxing and I hardly want to say the

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:56.570 
boxing and I hardly want to say the
boxing<00:02:55.650> is<00:02:55.770> dead<00:02:55.950> because<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.430> know<00:02:56.520> you

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
boxing is dead because you know you

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.030 
boxing is dead because you know you
don't<00:02:56.730> draw<00:02:57.000> on<00:02:57.150> many<00:02:57.510> pack<00:02:57.780> our<00:02:57.990> room<00:02:58.200> 90,000

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
don't draw on many pack our room 90,000

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.710 
don't draw on many pack our room 90,000
people<00:02:59.130> to<00:02:59.340> two<00:02:59.520> fights<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.030> sports<00:03:00.300> not<00:03:00.510> dead

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
people to two fights the sports not dead

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.660 
people to two fights the sports not dead
if<00:03:00.870> you<00:03:00.960> can<00:03:01.140> do<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.470> but<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.130> think<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:02.610> needs

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
if you can do that but I think it needs

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.820 
if you can do that but I think it needs
to<00:03:02.970> be<00:03:03.060> tweaked<00:03:03.420> a<00:03:03.570> little<00:03:03.600> bit<00:03:03.960> and<00:03:04.410> I<00:03:04.650> think

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:04.830 
to be tweaked a little bit and I think

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.200 
to be tweaked a little bit and I think
there's<00:03:05.040> some<00:03:05.250> things<00:03:05.460> going<00:03:05.670> on<00:03:05.790> but<00:03:05.970> if<00:03:06.090> you

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
there's some things going on but if you

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:08.720 
there's some things going on but if you
go<00:03:06.360> back<00:03:06.630> to<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.990> 80s<00:03:07.680> and<00:03:07.890> when<00:03:08.490> you<00:03:08.610> had

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
go back to the 80s and when you had

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
go back to the 80s and when you had
sugar<00:03:08.940> ray<00:03:09.120> leonard<00:03:09.150> and<00:03:09.690> Hagler<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.200> Hearns

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
sugar ray leonard and Hagler and Hearns

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.900

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
and Durant people say well they were

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.370

better<00:03:12.150> fighters<00:03:12.600> well<00:03:12.750> there's<00:03:12.930> still<00:03:13.020> good

better fighters well there's still good
fighters<00:03:13.830> now<00:03:14.040> but<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.370> difference<00:03:14.790> was<00:03:14.850> the

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
fighters now but the difference was the

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.820

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:21.230 
media um you know the way it is right
now<00:03:19.140> you<00:03:19.890> know<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.160> fighters<00:03:20.580> get<00:03:20.850> in<00:03:21.000> there

who's one of the more accessible
fighters<00:03:27.330> out<00:03:27.510> there<00:03:27.570> but<00:03:28.110> what<00:03:28.140> we<00:03:28.440> end<00:03:28.620> up

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
fighters out there but what we end up

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.800 
fighters out there but what we end up
seeing<00:03:29.040> is<00:03:29.310> you<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.880> an<00:03:30.120> opening<00:03:30.540> press

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
seeing is you have an opening press

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.330 
seeing is you have an opening press
conference<00:03:31.380> where<00:03:31.530> they<00:03:31.620> talk<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:32.040> the<00:03:32.160> media

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
conference where they talk to the media

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.300 
conference where they talk to the media
then<00:03:33.120> you<00:03:33.330> have<00:03:33.600> a<00:03:34.080> fight<00:03:34.800> week<00:03:35.010> press

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
then you have a fight week press

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.890 
then you have a fight week press
conference<00:03:35.790> maybe<00:03:36.000> you<00:03:36.209> have<00:03:36.390> a<00:03:36.420> conference

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
conference maybe you have a conference

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.330 
conference maybe you have a conference
call<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:37.320> other<00:03:37.440> than<00:03:37.560> that<00:03:37.740> there's<00:03:38.130> no

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
call and other than that there's no

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.790 
call and other than that there's no
media<00:03:38.700> so<00:03:39.120> the<00:03:39.240> media<00:03:39.630> has<00:03:39.870> gone<00:03:40.110> away<00:03:40.290> from

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
media so the media has gone away from

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:42.440 
media so the media has gone away from
covering<00:03:41.250> boxing<00:03:41.730> because<00:03:41.850> they<00:03:42.180> don't<00:03:42.360> have

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
covering boxing because they don't have

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.690 
covering boxing because they don't have

and the fans were in the gym every day

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.090 
and the fans were in the gym every day
as<00:03:54.360> the<00:03:54.510> fighters<00:03:54.870> were<00:03:55.020> training<00:03:55.320> it<00:03:55.560> that's

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
as the fighters were training it that's

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.220 
as the fighters were training it that's
not<00:03:56.370> the<00:03:56.400> case<00:03:56.580> of<00:03:56.970> what's<00:03:57.120> going<00:03:57.330> on<00:03:57.570> now<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
not the case of what's going on now and

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.560 
not the case of what's going on now and
it's<00:03:58.620> really<00:03:59.010> unfortunate<00:03:59.490> that<00:04:00.000> that's<00:04:00.270> you

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
it's really unfortunate that that's you

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.240 
it's really unfortunate that that's you
know<00:04:00.720> that<00:04:00.930> we're<00:04:01.170> in<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.560> stage<00:04:01.950> but<00:04:02.220> i

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
know that we're in that stage but i

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.710 
know that we're in that stage but i
think<00:04:02.550> you<00:04:02.730> know<00:04:02.880> there's<00:04:03.120> a<00:04:03.180> lot<00:04:03.420> of<00:04:03.450> things

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
think you know there's a lot of things

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.540 
think you know there's a lot of things
that<00:04:03.840> have<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.200> change<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.650> get<00:04:04.800> back<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.490> i

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
that have to change to get back but i

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:07.130 
that have to change to get back but i
think<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.850> good<00:04:06.150> step<00:04:06.450> would<00:04:06.660> be<00:04:06.720> if<00:04:06.990> the

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
think a good step would be if the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.290 
think a good step would be if the
fighters<00:04:07.680> themselves<00:04:07.950> would<00:04:08.610> open<00:04:09.000> up<00:04:09.090> their

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:09.300 
fighters themselves would open up their

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.140 
fighters themselves would open up their
training<00:04:09.720> camps<00:04:10.080> to<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> media<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.310> fans

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
training camps to the media and to fans

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.990

little<00:04:30.310> better<00:04:30.669> in<00:04:30.879> kind<00:04:31.090> of<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.240> way<00:04:31.360> they

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
little better in kind of the way they

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:33.540 
little better in kind of the way they
should<00:04:32.050> be<00:04:32.289> done<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.830> boxing<00:04:33.190> just<00:04:33.370> kind<00:04:33.520> of

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
should be done and boxing just kind of

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:34.830 
should be done and boxing just kind of
has<00:04:33.669> to<00:04:33.699> catch<00:04:33.970> up<00:04:34.150> in<00:04:34.270> terms<00:04:34.419> of<00:04:34.539> that<00:04:34.629> mindset

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
has to catch up in terms of that mindset

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.589 
has to catch up in terms of that mindset
because<00:04:35.050> you're<00:04:35.259> right<00:04:35.460> for<00:04:36.460> most<00:04:36.639> fights<00:04:37.000> the

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:37.599 
because you're right for most fights the

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:39.749 
because you're right for most fights the
media<00:04:37.960> lead<00:04:38.259> into<00:04:38.620> a<00:04:38.650> fight<00:04:38.949> is<00:04:39.159> limited<00:04:39.610> to

00:04:39.749 --> 00:04:39.759 
media lead into a fight is limited to

00:04:39.759 --> 00:04:41.969 
media lead into a fight is limited to
the<00:04:39.970> two<00:04:40.210> days<00:04:40.479> going<00:04:41.289> into<00:04:41.379> a<00:04:41.530> fight<00:04:41.800> and

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:41.979 
the two days going into a fight and

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.689 
the two days going into a fight and
that's<00:04:42.099> not<00:04:42.310> enough<00:04:43.860> yeah<00:04:44.860> I<00:04:45.069> think<00:04:45.400> you<00:04:45.580> know

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
that's not enough yeah I think you know

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.760 
that's not enough yeah I think you know
that<00:04:45.729> the<00:04:46.060> public<00:04:46.870> when<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.110> public<00:04:47.289> knows<00:04:47.740> a

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
that the public when the public knows a

ABC and CBS and NBC and so he got a

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:17.640 
ABC and CBS and NBC and so he got a
great<00:05:16.090> deal<00:05:16.300> of<00:05:16.330> exposure<00:05:16.750> so<00:05:16.990> people<00:05:17.349> cared

it's<00:06:04.509> not<00:06:04.629> like<00:06:04.690> mixed<00:06:05.139> martial<00:06:05.469> arts<00:06:05.650> cuz<00:06:05.770> we

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:05.889 
it's not like mixed martial arts cuz we

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:07.439 
it's not like mixed martial arts cuz we
cover<00:06:06.069> both<00:06:06.340> is<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:06.699> know<00:06:06.789> as<00:06:06.849> MMA<00:06:07.240> is<00:06:07.300> not

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 
cover both is you know as MMA is not

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:08.790 
cover both is you know as MMA is not
blowing<00:06:07.659> it<00:06:07.840> away<00:06:07.960> in<00:06:08.199> terms<00:06:08.379> of<00:06:08.440> web<00:06:08.590> hits

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:08.800 
blowing it away in terms of web hits

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.730 
blowing it away in terms of web hits
yeah<00:06:09.370> you<00:06:09.430> know<00:06:09.669> I<00:06:09.699> think<00:06:10.300> that<00:06:10.659> what<00:06:11.020> MMA<00:06:11.469> does

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:11.740 
yeah you know I think that what MMA does

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:14.219 
yeah you know I think that what MMA does
well<00:06:12.099> is<00:06:12.400> Dana<00:06:13.150> White<00:06:13.449> and<00:06:13.659> Lorenzo<00:06:14.050> Fertitta

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:14.229 
well is Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:16.860 
well is Dana White and Lorenzo Fertitta
really<00:06:14.860> with<00:06:14.979> the<00:06:15.129> UFC<00:06:15.430> they<00:06:16.270> looked<00:06:16.629> at<00:06:16.779> the

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
really with the UFC they looked at the

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.779 
really with the UFC they looked at the
mistakes<00:06:17.259> that<00:06:17.349> box<00:06:17.680> he<00:06:17.860> made<00:06:18.069> and<00:06:18.279> because

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:18.789 
mistakes that box he made and because

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:20.760 
mistakes that box he made and because
MMA<00:06:19.240> was<00:06:19.389> a<00:06:19.419> fledgling<00:06:19.779> sport<00:06:20.349> and<00:06:20.469> didn't

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
MMA was a fledgling sport and didn't

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:23.159 
MMA was a fledgling sport and didn't
have<00:06:21.009> a<00:06:21.400> lot<00:06:21.819> of<00:06:21.879> route<00:06:22.240> they<00:06:22.719> were<00:06:22.779> able<00:06:22.990> to

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
have a lot of route they were able to

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.080 
have a lot of route they were able to
mold<00:06:23.590> it<00:06:23.830> the<00:06:23.949> way<00:06:24.099> they<00:06:24.310> wanted<00:06:24.639> and<00:06:24.849> even

00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:25.090 
mold it the way they wanted and even

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:26.550 
mold it the way they wanted and even
then<00:06:25.210> it<00:06:25.330> took<00:06:25.360> them<00:06:25.690> a<00:06:25.719> long<00:06:25.960> time<00:06:26.259> and<00:06:26.289> they

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:26.560 
then it took them a long time and they

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.920 
then it took them a long time and they
still<00:06:26.590> have<00:06:27.009> a<00:06:27.039> ways<00:06:27.310> to<00:06:27.340> go<00:06:27.550> but<00:06:28.240> but<00:06:28.750> if

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930 
still have a ways to go but but if

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.659 
still have a ways to go but but if
boxing<00:06:29.529> could<00:06:29.770> take<00:06:30.039> some<00:06:30.310> of<00:06:30.340> the<00:06:30.490> things

00:06:30.659 --> 00:06:30.669 
boxing could take some of the things

00:06:30.669 --> 00:06:32.909 
boxing could take some of the things
that<00:06:30.759> are<00:06:30.940> working<00:06:31.419> in<00:06:31.509> MMA<00:06:31.960> and<00:06:32.169> part<00:06:32.680> of<00:06:32.770> it

00:06:32.909 --> 00:06:32.919 
that are working in MMA and part of it

00:06:32.919 --> 00:06:34.529 
that are working in MMA and part of it
is<00:06:33.009> just<00:06:33.310> the<00:06:33.460> accessibility<00:06:34.389> of<00:06:34.419> the

00:06:34.529 --> 00:06:34.539 
is just the accessibility of the

00:06:34.539 --> 00:06:36.600 
is just the accessibility of the
fighters<00:06:34.870> you<00:06:35.349> know<00:06:35.469> the<00:06:35.620> in<00:06:35.800> MMA<00:06:36.310> you<00:06:36.370> can

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:36.610 
fighters you know the in MMA you can

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:38.970 
fighters you know the in MMA you can
walk<00:06:36.849> into<00:06:37.149> Xtreme<00:06:37.779> Couture<00:06:37.990> and<00:06:38.289> see<00:06:38.649> the

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:38.980 
walk into Xtreme Couture and see the

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:40.470 
walk into Xtreme Couture and see the
years<00:06:39.220> and<00:06:39.370> you<00:06:39.490> can<00:06:39.670> interact<00:06:40.000> with<00:06:40.300> them<00:06:40.390> in

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:40.480 
years and you can interact with them in

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:42.570 
years and you can interact with them in
a<00:06:40.510> lot<00:06:40.720> of<00:06:40.810> cases<00:06:40.960> train<00:06:41.440> with<00:06:41.710> them<00:06:41.890> and<00:06:42.310> I

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
a lot of cases train with them and I

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:44.220 
a lot of cases train with them and I
think<00:06:42.640> that<00:06:43.000> if<00:06:43.150> you<00:06:43.180> get<00:06:43.570> that<00:06:43.750> grassroots

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:44.230 
think that if you get that grassroots

00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.440 
think that if you get that grassroots
support<00:06:45.070> where<00:06:45.250> the<00:06:45.400> public<00:06:45.850> feels<00:06:46.150> like<00:06:46.270> they

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:46.450 
support where the public feels like they

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:48.210 
support where the public feels like they
know<00:06:46.720> you<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:47.080> they<00:06:47.140> care<00:06:47.530> about<00:06:47.650> you<00:06:47.950> I<00:06:48.010> think

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
know you and they care about you I think

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:49.770 
know you and they care about you I think
that<00:06:48.340> makes<00:06:48.520> a<00:06:48.610> big<00:06:48.820> difference<00:06:48.850> all<00:06:49.660> right

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
that makes a big difference all right

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.010 
that makes a big difference all right
good<00:06:50.110> job<00:06:50.170> will<00:06:50.440> talk<00:06:50.590> to<00:06:50.710> you<00:06:51.900> thank<00:06:52.900> you
