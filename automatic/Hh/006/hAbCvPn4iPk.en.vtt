00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.830 
through and you get all screwed over but
that's<00:01:31.799> where<00:01:32.100> this<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.240> i<00:01:33.750> guess

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
that's where this actually in i guess

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.140 
that's where this actually in i guess
i'll<00:01:34.200> just<00:01:34.259> say<00:01:34.590> intercepts<00:01:35.250> where<00:01:35.939> it

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
i'll just say intercepts where it

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.660 
i'll just say intercepts where it
actually<00:01:36.390> gets<00:01:36.960> into<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.680> whole<00:01:37.979> gameplay<00:01:38.640> of

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
actually gets into the whole gameplay of

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.210 
actually gets into the whole gameplay of
getting<00:01:39.329> this<00:01:39.450> crazy<00:01:39.840> difficult<00:01:40.650> i<00:01:40.740> guess<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
getting this crazy difficult i guess a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.429 
getting this crazy difficult i guess a
very<00:01:41.520> unique<00:01:41.850> gameplay<00:01:42.180> and<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.049> reason<00:01:43.229> why

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
very unique gameplay and the reason why

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.050 
very unique gameplay and the reason why
i<00:01:43.470> say<00:01:43.740> this<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.040> because<00:01:44.399> as<00:01:44.549> soon<00:01:44.759> as<00:01:44.909> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
i say this is because as soon as you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.490 
i say this is because as soon as you
join<00:01:45.270> that<00:01:45.479> game<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.899> you<00:01:45.990> go<00:01:46.020> right<00:01:46.320> down
