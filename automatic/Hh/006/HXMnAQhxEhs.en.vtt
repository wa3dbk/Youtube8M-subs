on the challenges of going from grass to
turf<00:00:35.969> I<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.469> main<00:00:37.680> difference<00:00:37.739> between

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
turf I think the main difference between

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.630 
turf I think the main difference between
play<00:00:39.239> on<00:00:39.420> turf<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.020> grass<00:00:40.680> is<00:00:40.980> just<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> speed

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
play on turf and grass is just the speed

of play I you definitely have to get
used<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.309> how<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.850> ball<00:00:45.120> moves<00:00:45.390> how<00:00:45.780> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
used to how the ball moves how it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.819

bounces<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:48.000> really<00:00:48.230> kind<00:00:49.230> of<00:00:49.440> adjust

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.469 
that's what we have to go after i think
it's<00:01:31.530> it's<00:01:31.829> not<00:01:32.070> ideal<00:01:32.220> for<00:01:32.790> soccer<00:01:33.210> players

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
it's it's not ideal for soccer players

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.530 
it's it's not ideal for soccer players
we<00:01:33.689> love<00:01:33.869> playing<00:01:34.110> on<00:01:34.350> grass<00:01:35.000> but<00:01:36.000> it<00:01:36.090> is<00:01:36.270> what

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
we love playing on grass but it is what

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.080 
we love playing on grass but it is what
it<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:36.689> and<00:01:36.869> we'll<00:01:37.170> make<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.439> best<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:38.090> are

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it is and we'll make the best of it are

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.609 
it is and we'll make the best of it are
you<00:01:39.210> think<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:39.540> a<00:01:39.600> little<00:01:39.630> bit<00:01:39.900> of<00:01:39.930> a<00:01:40.140> harder

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
you think it's a little bit of a harder

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.710 
you think it's a little bit of a harder
surface<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.220> sometimes<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:42.210> difficult<00:01:42.630> to

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
surface and sometimes more difficult to

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.929 
surface and sometimes more difficult to
get<00:01:42.869> under<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.320> ball<00:01:43.470> for<00:01:44.130> of<00:01:44.430> course<00:01:44.670> shots

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
get under the ball for of course shots

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.810 
get under the ball for of course shots
crosses<00:01:45.509> that<00:01:45.960> kind<00:01:46.140> of<00:01:46.200> stuff<00:01:46.439> but<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:47.220> lot<00:01:47.790> of

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
crosses that kind of stuff but a lot of

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.429 
crosses that kind of stuff but a lot of
us<00:01:48.030> are<00:01:48.180> very<00:01:48.390> used<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.659> playing<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.140> tariffs

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
us are very used to playing on tariffs

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.319 
us are very used to playing on tariffs
whether<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> be<00:01:49.890> at<00:01:50.040> college<00:01:50.399> or<00:01:50.579> with<00:01:50.700> our<00:01:50.850> WPS

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
whether it be at college or with our WPS

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.780 
whether it be at college or with our WPS
teams<00:01:51.600> so<00:01:52.259> it'll<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.740> little<00:01:53.369> bit<00:01:53.579> getting

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
teams so it'll take a little bit getting

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.280 
teams so it'll take a little bit getting
used<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.180> but<00:01:54.420> it's<00:01:54.630> nothing<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:55.020> we're

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
used to but it's nothing that we're

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:56.870 
used to but it's nothing that we're
completely<00:01:55.770> unfamiliar<00:01:56.280> with<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
completely unfamiliar with you know I

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.370 
completely unfamiliar with you know I
think<00:01:57.119> it<00:01:57.240> depends<00:01:57.509> if<00:01:57.689> they<00:01:57.719> water<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.200> turf

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
think it depends if they water the turf

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.620 
think it depends if they water the turf
down<00:01:58.590> as<00:01:58.799> well<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.729> speed<00:01:59.939> picks<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.360> but

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
down as well the speed picks up but

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.380 
down as well the speed picks up but
definitely<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.369> I<00:02:02.610> would<00:02:02.790> say<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.000> final

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
definitely the the I would say the final

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
definitely the the I would say the final
passes<00:02:03.869> are<00:02:04.140> a<00:02:04.200> little<00:02:04.350> bit<00:02:04.500> harder<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.829> you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
passes are a little bit harder to you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.980 
passes are a little bit harder to you
know<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.909> texture<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.509> have<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.719> put<00:02:06.869> on

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
know that the texture you have to put on

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.510 
know that the texture you have to put on
the<00:02:07.079> ball<00:02:07.259> on<00:02:07.530> turf<00:02:08.009> is<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.220> little<00:02:08.429> bit

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
the ball on turf is a little bit

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.100 
the ball on turf is a little bit
different<00:02:08.879> so<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.599> know<00:02:09.720> there<00:02:09.869> will<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.080> a

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
different so you know there will be a

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:11.630 
different so you know there will be a
lot<00:02:10.259> of<00:02:10.349> balls<00:02:10.530> running<00:02:10.979> out<00:02:11.069> of<00:02:11.099> balance<00:02:11.370> more

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
lot of balls running out of balance more

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.140 
lot of balls running out of balance more
so<00:02:11.819> than<00:02:11.970> we<00:02:12.120> do<00:02:12.270> on<00:02:12.300> grass<00:02:12.629> but

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so than we do on grass but

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.420 
so than we do on grass but
something<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.540> got<00:02:13.659> to<00:02:13.689> get<00:02:13.840> the<00:02:13.870> feel<00:02:14.079> for

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
something you got to get the feel for

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.130 
something you got to get the feel for
sometimes<00:02:15.430> I<00:02:15.579> think<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:16.120> if<00:02:16.420> it<00:02:16.720> is<00:02:16.870> a<00:02:16.900> little

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
sometimes I think that if it is a little

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:19.350 
sometimes I think that if it is a little
bit<00:02:17.349> harder<00:02:18.069> and<00:02:18.310> the<00:02:18.640> ball<00:02:18.790> is<00:02:18.819> bouncing<00:02:19.299> a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
bit harder and the ball is bouncing a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.789 
bit harder and the ball is bouncing a
little<00:02:19.540> bit<00:02:19.659> more<00:02:19.810> becomes<00:02:20.230> a<00:02:20.439> more

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
little bit more becomes a more

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.240 
little bit more becomes a more
competitive<00:02:21.189> game<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:21.849> think<00:02:22.860> which<00:02:23.860> for<00:02:24.159> us

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
competitive game I think which for us

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.679 
competitive game I think which for us
could<00:02:24.549> be<00:02:24.670> good<00:02:24.849> we<00:02:25.000> have<00:02:25.209> some<00:02:25.239> of<00:02:25.599> the<00:02:25.629> best

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:25.689 
could be good we have some of the best

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:28.080 
could be good we have some of the best
ball<00:02:26.079> winners<00:02:26.439> in<00:02:27.159> the<00:02:27.280> world<00:02:27.459> on<00:02:27.700> our<00:02:27.819> side

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
ball winners in the world on our side

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.000 
ball winners in the world on our side
but<00:02:28.360> I<00:02:28.420> think<00:02:28.689> that<00:02:28.720> we'd<00:02:28.989> prefer<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.859> know<00:02:29.980> to

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
but I think that we'd prefer you know to

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.500 
but I think that we'd prefer you know to
keep<00:02:30.189> the<00:02:30.459> ball<00:02:30.579> on<00:02:30.640> the<00:02:30.849> ground<00:02:31.090> and<00:02:31.269> keep<00:02:31.359> it

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
keep the ball on the ground and keep it

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.289 
keep the ball on the ground and keep it
moving<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.109> it<00:02:32.769> could<00:02:33.640> become<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.939> little<00:02:34.209> bit

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:34.299 
moving so it could become a little bit

00:02:34.299 --> 00:02:36.119 
moving so it could become a little bit
more<00:02:34.420> of<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.599> physical<00:02:34.720> matchup<00:02:35.109> I<00:02:35.560> would<00:02:35.739> say<00:02:35.920> I

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
more of a physical matchup I would say I

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.819 
more of a physical matchup I would say I
think<00:02:36.700> it's<00:02:37.689> definitely<00:02:37.930> something<00:02:38.590> that

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:38.829 
think it's definitely something that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.649 
think it's definitely something that
takes<00:02:39.400> a<00:02:39.579> little<00:02:39.760> bit<00:02:39.909> of<00:02:39.970> time<00:02:40.150> to<00:02:40.299> get<00:02:40.420> used

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
takes a little bit of time to get used

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.710 
takes a little bit of time to get used
to<00:02:40.870> but<00:02:41.200> as<00:02:41.620> long<00:02:42.220> as<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.459> plan<00:02:42.700> on<00:02:42.909> it<00:02:43.120> for<00:02:43.689> a

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
to but as long as you plan on it for a

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.140 
to but as long as you plan on it for a
little<00:02:43.870> bit<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.859> getting<00:02:45.280> used<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.670> it<00:02:45.819> you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
little bit and getting used to it you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.159 
little bit and getting used to it you
can<00:02:46.299> adjust<00:02:46.690> pretty<00:02:47.230> well<00:02:47.500> just<00:02:47.709> soccer
