the<00:03:50.090> graveyard<00:03:50.480> based<00:03:50.630> deck<00:03:50.870> so<00:03:51.019> i<00:03:51.080> don't

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
the graveyard based deck so i don't

the<00:04:35.389> reason<00:04:35.690> it<00:04:35.810> was<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.199> the<00:04:36.470> sideboard<00:04:36.830> for

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
the reason it was in the sideboard for

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:38.200 
the reason it was in the sideboard for
the<00:04:36.979> first<00:04:37.220> place<00:04:37.400> was<00:04:37.610> to<00:04:37.639> be<00:04:37.880> able<00:04:37.970> to<00:04:38.090> hit

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
the first place was to be able to hit

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.450 
the first place was to be able to hit
gods<00:04:38.419> when<00:04:38.690> they're<00:04:38.840> turned<00:04:39.020> on<00:04:39.229> but<00:04:40.099> it<00:04:40.160> also

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
gods when they're turned on but it also

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.129 
gods when they're turned on but it also
isn't<00:04:40.789> that<00:04:41.000> bad<00:04:41.210> when<00:04:41.720> we're<00:04:41.840> trying<00:04:41.930> to

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
isn't that bad when we're trying to

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:44.350 
isn't that bad when we're trying to
accelerate<00:04:42.470> into<00:04:42.830> you<00:04:43.669> can<00:04:43.789> do<00:04:43.880> it<00:04:43.970> on<00:04:44.030> for

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
accelerate into you can do it on for

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.120 
accelerate into you can do it on for
