good<00:04:28.300> experience<00:04:29.300> at<00:04:29.780> home<00:04:30.080> but<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.620> should

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
good experience at home but I should

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:32.680 
good experience at home but I should
mention<00:04:31.190> also<00:04:31.669> they<00:04:31.820> should<00:04:31.880> give<00:04:32.240> yourself

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
mention also they should give yourself

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.529 
mention also they should give yourself
at<00:04:32.900> least<00:04:32.930> six<00:04:33.620> to<00:04:33.770> seven<00:04:34.099> days

00:04:34.529 --> 00:04:34.539 
at least six to seven days

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:36.610 
at least six to seven days
breather<00:04:35.539> just<00:04:35.690> so<00:04:35.960> that<00:04:36.080> your<00:04:36.199> skin<00:04:36.409> can

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
breather just so that your skin can

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.080 
breather just so that your skin can
regenerate<00:04:36.949> because<00:04:37.340> it<00:04:37.460> is<00:04:37.550> an<00:04:37.789> abrasive

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090

treatment<00:04:38.750> and<00:04:38.930> too<00:04:39.050> much<00:04:39.199> of<00:04:39.259> it<00:04:39.500> is<00:04:39.680> actually

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
treatment and too much of it is actually

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.680 
treatment and too much of it is actually
damaging<00:04:40.490> to<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.699> skin<00:04:40.729> I'm<00:04:41.210> planning<00:04:41.599> on
