steam<00:03:15.440> engine<00:03:15.650> so<00:03:16.070> for<00:03:16.310> his<00:03:16.400> hot<00:03:16.610> steamed<00:03:17.000> runs

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:17.330 
steam engine so for his hot steamed runs

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.060 
steam engine so for his hot steamed runs
from<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.780> kettle<00:03:17.990> to<00:03:18.230> the<00:03:18.320> cylinder<00:03:18.830> and

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
from the kettle to the cylinder and

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.070 
from the kettle to the cylinder and
raises<00:03:19.460> the<00:03:19.580> plunger<00:03:20.000> second<00:03:20.330> cold<00:03:20.600> water<00:03:20.900> is

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
raises the plunger second cold water is

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.050 
raises the plunger second cold water is
injected<00:03:21.560> into<00:03:21.800> the<00:03:22.100> cylinder<00:03:22.550> and<00:03:22.580> the<00:03:22.850> steam

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
injected into the cylinder and the steam

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.420 
injected into the cylinder and the steam
condenses<00:03:23.300> the<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:23.960> called<00:03:24.170> partial<00:03:24.620> vacuum

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
condenses the so called partial vacuum

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:27.640 
condenses the so called partial vacuum
