next<00:01:28.470> I<00:01:28.560> picked<00:01:28.860> up<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.640> white<00:01:29.880> um

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
next I picked up just the white um

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.719 
next I picked up just the white um
there's<00:01:30.900> no<00:01:30.990> shimmer<00:01:31.560> or<00:01:31.740> glitter<00:01:31.920> anything

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
there's no shimmer or glitter anything

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.030 
there's no shimmer or glitter anything
is<00:01:32.850> just<00:01:33.060> plain<00:01:33.360> white<00:01:33.600> because<00:01:34.409> I<00:01:34.560> ran<00:01:34.829> out

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
is just plain white because I ran out

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.460 
is just plain white because I ran out
and<00:01:35.250> usually<00:01:35.700> I<00:01:35.759> go<00:01:36.030> for<00:01:36.270> OPI<00:01:36.600> white<00:01:36.990> because<00:01:37.320> I

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
and usually I go for OPI white because I

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.800 
and usually I go for OPI white because I
really<00:01:37.710> like<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> formula<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.240> decided<00:01:39.630> to

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
really like the formula but I decided to

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.319 
really like the formula but I decided to
try<00:01:39.990> this<00:01:40.049> one<00:01:40.439> since<00:01:40.680> it's<00:01:41.189> so<00:01:41.549> much<00:01:41.759> cheaper

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
try this one since it's so much cheaper

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.090 
try this one since it's so much cheaper
so<00:01:42.630> hopefully<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.770> is<00:01:44.250> good<00:01:45.710> the<00:01:46.710> whole<00:01:46.920> reason

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
so hopefully it is good the whole reason

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.460 
so hopefully it is good the whole reason
I<00:01:47.369> wanted<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> make<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:48.149> models<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.750> order<00:01:49.200> it's

I<00:02:08.709> don't<00:02:09.039> have<00:02:09.159> anything<00:02:09.459> like<00:02:09.640> this<00:02:09.819> so<00:02:10.179> I

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
I don't have anything like this so I

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.059 
I don't have anything like this so I
really<00:02:10.599> wanted<00:02:10.840> to<00:02:10.959> pick<00:02:11.170> it<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.409> the<00:02:11.860> only

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
really wanted to pick it up the only

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.830 
really wanted to pick it up the only
thing<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.640> clear<00:02:12.909> polish<00:02:13.209> is<00:02:13.599> kind

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
thing is that the clear polish is kind

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.750 
thing is that the clear polish is kind
of<00:02:13.959> thick<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.650> rewrites<00:02:15.129> the<00:02:15.370> Polish

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
of thick and it rewrites the Polish

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.300 
of thick and it rewrites the Polish
underneath<00:02:16.209> so<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.290> just<00:02:17.319> have<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.739> watch<00:02:18.129> out

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
underneath so you just have to watch out

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.089 
underneath so you just have to watch out
for<00:02:18.340> that<00:02:21.659> last<00:02:22.659> from<00:02:22.989> superdrug<00:02:23.560> I<00:02:23.709> picked<00:02:23.950> up

fini<00:02:36.760> la<00:02:37.030> is<00:02:37.269> better<00:02:37.569> in<00:02:37.900> my<00:02:38.049> opinion<00:02:38.579> and<00:02:39.579> this

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
fini la is better in my opinion and this

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330 
fini la is better in my opinion and this
is<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> really<00:02:40.540> really<00:02:40.569> nice<00:02:40.980> properly<00:02:41.980> shade
