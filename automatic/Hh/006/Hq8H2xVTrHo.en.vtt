00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.020
 What's up kids? Nothing, this is 

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:07.690
 just to tell you what I'm going to do 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.360
 another new gambaria hours of teaching in 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.549
 the video what is going to be is going to be one of 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.630
 the 200 liters I have in the 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.780
 logan room several 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.980
 what kind of eternal love I do not know yet 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:20.150
 honestly I do not know I do not know if I found out 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:22.369
 red m 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.650
 acquaintances I'm little be a bit silly 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.510
 as I have so many I will catch the three 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.980
 small aquariums that are below the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.189
 window that you can also know now 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.570
 that there are black sakura are the various guns 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.350
 that are as careless as they are 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.899
 growing the cure plate very well 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.670
 and I want to get a big aquarium of 

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.930
 black sakura to be able to teach it well 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.730
 because in those little ones you can not 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.010
 continue well and thus practically 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.859
 we would all have to see how they are going 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.960
 reproducing in the channel will shrink what 

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.780
 I teach good there you have the sailor who 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.170
 always see and nothing is very good 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.089
 I teach the aquarium now and everything 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.769
 well these are the great several that I 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.230
 I tell you that they are the hangovers the re 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.210
 sure the black sure is full of 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.949
 black prawns out there you can see 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.500
 some down there 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.060
 they are also super super super big not 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.729
 it's so comfortable for the ones I've seen 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.100
 so big prawns neo cardinal the 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.570
 they really look like cockroaches 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.970
 are the several that I have 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.310
 forgotten but to notice is that they do not stop 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.500
 to breed and then a black color but 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.270
 black black 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.550
 this one here has absolutely nothing 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.030
 and then wait here because it has the same 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.750
 prawns 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.619
 for equal enormous bold to ramÃ³n and 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.000
 also to because it was that 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:37.820
 writing blue ones that are 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.340
 we are going to teach the eagles 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.509
 So we have grazing microalgae 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.509
 that comes out of the crystal 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.140
 I guess I look and we have a 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 I had also restored 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.380
 I already know what the videos of 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.520
 shrimp, you 'll know how the 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.460
 history of the offspring and the whole roll 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.250
 Well, I'm going to take the blacks 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.050
 here and they're going to go to this one here this 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.660
 here it's practically empty 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:11.230
 he has absolutely nothing has 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.670
 how many guppies and good and have the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.140
 By the way, I'm seeing the female 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.819
 see if it's going to breed right now that I'm going 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.400
 to change up the female in the nest 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:22.760
 here I have a record of belo macho and 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.030
 a 144 normal female that I want to 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.030
 breed 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.890
 it's going to be time to change the side 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.530
 you can change the letters once at the end is 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.540
 a dizzy what I do but good 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.280
 well here I also have the aquarium of 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.020
 discards is this is the one that is full 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.430
 from in the garden trees we are looking at 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.930
 one that has a number of eggs 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.190
 let's focus what this is always 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:45.190
 interesting to see and it's nice 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.590
 and it's safer to look at how the 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:53.220
 belly as it already has the belly that already 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.260
 more than eggs are practically the 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:59.110
 formed prawns is not that the belly 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:00.550
 If you understand me are the legs that 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.650
 he has the eggs there that's where 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.230
 the young will be born 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:07.460
 it just ends down just the back light 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.350
 my mother 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.280
 well then that the new project is 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.110
 change all the blacks to this nose 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.569
 that will be laborious first change 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:19.689
 fish 

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:22.540
 I will have to buy a special screen 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:24.549
 for prawns and I'll have to empty the 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:27.040
 water completely and prepare all of that 

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.749
 we're going to see it in a videotutorial that 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.450
 it's going to be the same as the assembly of 300 

00:03:28.749 --> 00:03:34.150
 liters but in this little one also already 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.629
 I bought the ph driver for 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:39.459
 have them regular with ph and nothing to be 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.659
 attentive that the montage will be cool 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.659
 of this water and a greeting
