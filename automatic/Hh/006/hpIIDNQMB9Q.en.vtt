00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
with a ka please out it changes to a DSR

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.590 
with a ka please out it changes to a DSR
then<00:01:11.340> decides<00:01:11.670> he<00:01:11.760> wants<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.000> get<00:01:12.090> escapees

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
then decides he wants to get escapees

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.350 
then decides he wants to get escapees
out<00:01:12.810> minions<00:01:13.049> to<00:01:13.470> swaps<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:14.130> then<00:01:14.880> he<00:01:14.970> catches

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
X at the exact same time so to make this

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.020 
X at the exact same time so to make this
look<00:02:15.720> clean<00:02:16.080> the<00:02:16.260> key<00:02:16.410> is<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:17.220> sprint<00:02:17.550> before

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
look clean the key is to sprint before

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.420 
look clean the key is to sprint before
you<00:02:18.360> jump<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:18.930> then<00:02:19.650> it<00:02:19.770> gives<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> that<00:02:20.160> real

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
you jump and then it gives you that real

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.880 
you jump and then it gives you that real
always<00:02:21.330> like<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.510> gliding<00:02:21.900> mod<00:02:22.320> to<00:02:22.560> kind<00:02:22.860> of

always like a gliding mod to kind of
effect<00:02:23.360> okay<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:24.450> with<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.840> next<00:02:25.260> shot<00:02:25.410> we're

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
effect okay so with this next shot we're

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020

all wastes are on the general setting

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.370 
all wastes are on the general setting
that<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.740> weapon<00:02:38.160> already<00:02:39.030> has<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.720> full<00:02:40.230> auto

that the weapon already has a full auto
or<00:02:41.160> bust<00:02:42.290> so<00:02:43.290> what<00:02:43.470> you<00:02:43.590> need<00:02:43.770> to<00:02:43.890> do<00:02:44.040> is<00:02:44.310> you

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
or bust so what you need to do is you

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.120 
or bust so what you need to do is you
need<00:02:44.670> to<00:02:44.700> sprint<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.840> jump<00:02:46.140> again<00:02:46.320> tap

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
need to sprint as you jump again tap

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:48.620 
need to sprint as you jump again tap
that<00:02:47.280> select<00:02:47.670> fire<00:02:47.910> based<00:02:48.300> on<00:02:48.480> whatever

that select fire based on whatever

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.960 
that select fire based on whatever
weapon<00:02:49.080> you<00:02:49.200> choose<00:02:49.500> to<00:02:49.740> use<00:02:50.100> whatever<00:02:50.760> its

weapon you choose to use whatever its

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.530 
weapon you choose to use whatever its
default<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.570> and<00:02:52.050> then<00:02:52.650> triple<00:02:53.100> tap<00:02:53.280> Y<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.970> it

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
default is and then triple tap Y and it

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.760 
default is and then triple tap Y and it
will<00:02:54.630> look<00:02:54.780> something<00:02:55.230> along<00:02:55.470> these<00:02:55.620> lines

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
will look something along these lines

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.600 
will look something along these lines
hopefully<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.800> final<00:02:59.130> shot<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.340> is

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
hopefully so the final shot here is

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:01.970 
hopefully so the final shot here is
gonna<00:02:59.820> need<00:02:59.970> DSR<00:03:00.450> be<00:03:00.750> two<00:03:00.930> three<00:03:01.110> fast<00:03:01.560> hands

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
gonna need DSR be two three fast hands

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.970 
gonna need DSR be two three fast hands
and<00:03:02.130> some<00:03:02.700> shot<00:03:03.030> charges<00:03:03.680> now<00:03:04.680> this<00:03:04.830> shot

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
and some shot charges now this shot

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.350 
and some shot charges now this shot
couldn't<00:03:05.340> be<00:03:05.460> more<00:03:05.700> beautiful

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:06.360

literally<00:03:22.170> press<00:03:22.500> Y<00:03:22.740> before<00:03:23.250> you<00:03:23.370> jump<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:23.880> add

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
literally press Y before you jump to add

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.270 
literally press Y before you jump to add
to<00:03:24.180> smoothness<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.930> then<00:03:25.320> into<00:03:25.800> swap<00:03:26.040> and

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
to smoothness and then into swap and

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.790 
to smoothness and then into swap and
catch<00:03:26.850> any<00:03:27.060> X<00:03:27.270> for<00:03:27.510> the<00:03:27.570> wallbang<00:03:27.990> so<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.560> hope

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:28.800 
catch any X for the wallbang so I hope

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.200 
catch any X for the wallbang so I hope
