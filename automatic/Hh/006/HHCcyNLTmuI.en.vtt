going<00:00:15.919> on<00:00:16.129> in<00:00:16.340> grand<00:00:16.610> theft<00:00:16.669> auto<00:00:16.910> 5<00:00:17.240> online<00:00:17.270> so

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
going on in grand theft auto 5 online so

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.450 
going on in grand theft auto 5 online so
the<00:00:18.259> issue<00:00:18.380> is<00:00:18.560> that<00:00:18.680> players<00:00:19.009> are<00:00:19.189> actually

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
the issue is that players are actually

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.069 
the issue is that players are actually
not<00:00:19.579> receiving<00:00:20.060> any<00:00:20.210> RP<00:00:20.599> which<00:00:20.750> basically

00:00:21.069 --> 00:00:21.079 
not receiving any RP which basically

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:22.479 
not receiving any RP which basically
means<00:00:21.349> they're<00:00:21.619> losing<00:00:21.860> our<00:00:22.099> peak<00:00:22.340> because

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:22.489 
means they're losing our peak because

00:00:22.489 --> 00:00:23.979 
means they're losing our peak because
obviously<00:00:22.730> they're<00:00:23.329> completing<00:00:23.750> something

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:23.989 
obviously they're completing something

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:26.290 
obviously they're completing something
but<00:00:24.349> getting<00:00:24.649> nothing<00:00:24.980> in<00:00:25.040> return<00:00:25.099> I<00:00:25.640> don't

is<00:01:05.150> just<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.449> important<00:01:05.900> because<00:01:05.960> obviously

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:06.290 
is just so important because obviously

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:08.020 
is just so important because obviously
it's<00:01:06.650> used<00:01:06.830> to<00:01:06.950> level<00:01:07.220> up<00:01:07.370> and<00:01:07.550> everyone<00:01:07.850> wants

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
it's used to level up and everyone wants

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.610 
it's used to level up and everyone wants
to<00:01:08.060> love<00:01:08.210> love<00:01:08.450> and<00:01:08.690> be<00:01:08.780> a<00:01:08.810> higher<00:01:09.050> rank<00:01:09.350> and

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:09.620 
to love love and be a higher rank and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.800 
to love love and be a higher rank and
whenever<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.460> play<00:01:10.640> gt5<00:01:10.880> and<00:01:11.420> gets<00:01:11.540> so<00:01:11.690> many

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
whenever I play gt5 and gets so many

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.180 
whenever I play gt5 and gets so many
stars<00:01:12.050> because<00:01:12.350> you<00:01:12.380> run<00:01:12.590> someone<00:01:12.860> over<00:01:12.920> you

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:13.190 
stars because you run someone over you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.130 
stars because you run someone over you
steal<00:01:13.400> a<00:01:13.430> car<00:01:13.700> etc<00:01:13.850> you<00:01:14.330> get<00:01:14.480> stars<00:01:14.750> on<00:01:14.960> you

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
steal a car etc you get stars on you

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.630 
steal a car etc you get stars on you
then<00:01:15.500> you<00:01:15.590> keep<00:01:15.740> on<00:01:15.920> playing<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:16.310> get<00:01:16.490> more

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
then you keep on playing you get more

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.340 
then you keep on playing you get more
stars<00:01:16.940> on<00:01:17.150> you<00:01:17.270> eventually<00:01:17.600> you<00:01:17.930> lose<00:01:18.110> them

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:18.350 
stars on you eventually you lose them

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.650 
stars on you eventually you lose them
and<00:01:18.650> you<00:01:18.740> get<00:01:18.860> some<00:01:19.040> RP<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.580> I<00:01:20.120> guess<00:01:20.330> no<00:01:20.510> one

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
and you get some RP and I guess no one

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.720 
and you get some RP and I guess no one
uses<00:01:20.840> the<00:01:21.050> RP<00:01:21.380> method<00:01:21.710> of<00:01:21.830> losing<00:01:22.220> stars<00:01:22.490> to

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:22.730 
uses the RP method of losing stars to

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.460 
uses the RP method of losing stars to
get<00:01:22.880> some<00:01:23.060> RP<00:01:23.390> I<00:01:23.420> guess<00:01:23.690> really<00:01:23.960> no<00:01:24.110> one<00:01:24.290> does

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
get some RP I guess really no one does

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:25.540 
get some RP I guess really no one does
that<00:01:24.500> because<00:01:24.860> it's<00:01:25.010> probably<00:01:25.220> gonna<00:01:25.490> take

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
that because it's probably gonna take

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.000 
that because it's probably gonna take
too<00:01:25.940> long<00:01:26.120> but<00:01:26.360> it<00:01:26.810> is<00:01:26.930> good<00:01:27.170> additional<00:01:27.680> RP

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
too long but it is good additional RP

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.770 
too long but it is good additional RP
and<00:01:28.190> when<00:01:28.280> people<00:01:28.400> play<00:01:28.700> they<00:01:29.240> get<00:01:29.390> stars<00:01:29.600> on

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
and when people play they get stars on

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.030
