00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
so maybe over the holiday season you got

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:05.390 
so maybe over the holiday season you got
it<00:00:02.879> yourself<00:00:03.360> assignment<00:00:03.810> x5<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:05.040> first

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
it yourself assignment x5 the first

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.400 
it yourself assignment x5 the first
thing<00:00:05.700> you're<00:00:05.850> gonna<00:00:06.000> want<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.420> do<00:00:06.569> is<00:00:06.899> take<00:00:07.350> it

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
thing you're gonna want to do is take it

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:09.860 
thing you're gonna want to do is take it
apart<00:00:07.799> I<00:00:08.069> know<00:00:08.639> I<00:00:08.820> know<00:00:09.120> that<00:00:09.150> sounds<00:00:09.719> like

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
apart I know I know that sounds like

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.530 
apart I know I know that sounds like
kind<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.290> counterintuitive<00:00:10.849> but<00:00:11.849> one<00:00:12.330> of<00:00:12.360> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
kind of counterintuitive but one of the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.360 
kind of counterintuitive but one of the
things<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:12.929> noticed<00:00:13.290> that<00:00:13.440> happens<00:00:14.009> the<00:00:14.160> most

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:14.370 
things we noticed that happens the most

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.700 
things we noticed that happens the most
with<00:00:14.580> these<00:00:14.730> little<00:00:14.969> guys<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.599> LED<00:00:16.199> panels

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
with these little guys is the LED panels

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.710 
with these little guys is the LED panels
fall<00:00:16.920> up<00:00:17.130> so<00:00:17.730> you're<00:00:17.880> gonna<00:00:18.300> want<00:00:18.539> to<00:00:18.600> grab

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
fall up so you're gonna want to grab

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.870 
fall up so you're gonna want to grab
some<00:00:19.109> hot<00:00:19.289> glue<00:00:19.500> or<00:00:19.890> maybe<00:00:20.039> some<00:00:20.250> Krazy<00:00:20.520> Glue

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
some hot glue or maybe some Krazy Glue

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.330 
some hot glue or maybe some Krazy Glue
like<00:00:21.180> I<00:00:21.300> used<00:00:21.539> here<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> just<00:00:22.529> kind<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> weld

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
like I used here and just kind of weld

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.240 
like I used here and just kind of weld
the<00:00:23.609> edges<00:00:24.029> of<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.480> little<00:00:25.170> LED<00:00:25.619> panels<00:00:26.039> on

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
the edges of the little LED panels on

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.120 
the edges of the little LED panels on
the<00:00:26.369> sides<00:00:26.660> cuz<00:00:27.660> after<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.320> couple<00:00:28.590> crashes

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
the sides cuz after a couple crashes

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.679 
the sides cuz after a couple crashes
these<00:00:29.340> were<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.640> first<00:00:29.939> things<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.330> popped

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
these were the first things that popped

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.659 
these were the first things that popped
off

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
off

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:35.540 
off
so<00:00:32.669> put<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.090> DAB<00:00:33.329> on<00:00:33.540> each<00:00:33.809> side<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
so put a DAB on each side on the the

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.060 
so put a DAB on each side on the the
inside<00:00:35.730> of<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.180> panel<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.320> just<00:00:37.950> for

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
inside of the panel and then just for

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.530 
inside of the panel and then just for
good<00:00:38.100> measure<00:00:38.250> put<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:38.820> little<00:00:39.120> bit<00:00:39.270> on<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
good measure put a little bit on the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.020 
good measure put a little bit on the
outside<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.350> edges<00:00:40.649> too<00:00:40.890> just<00:00:41.790> to<00:00:41.850> make

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
outside on the edges too just to make

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.459 
outside on the edges too just to make
sure<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.420> these<00:00:42.600> little<00:00:42.809> guys<00:00:42.930> don't<00:00:43.230> fall

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
sure that these little guys don't fall

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.520 
sure that these little guys don't fall
off<00:00:43.700> then<00:00:44.700> if<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.270> want<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> make<00:00:45.660> your<00:00:45.840> cyma<00:00:46.379> a

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
off then if you want to make your cyma a

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.529 
off then if you want to make your cyma a
little<00:00:46.829> bit<00:00:46.950> more<00:00:47.160> special<00:00:47.610> you<00:00:47.640> can<00:00:47.940> paint<00:00:48.420> it

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
little bit more special you can paint it

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit more special you can paint it
like<00:00:48.690> I<00:00:48.809> did<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.350> use<00:00:49.800> some<00:00:50.129> you<00:00:50.820> know

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
like I did and I just use some you know

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.090 
like I did and I just use some you know
neon<00:00:51.420> bright<00:00:51.780> colors<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.530> went<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.829> green

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
neon bright colors I went with green

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.819 
neon bright colors I went with green
orange<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.879> blue<00:00:54.379> and<00:00:55.379> it<00:00:55.530> worked<00:00:55.710> pretty

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
orange and blue and it worked pretty

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.410 
orange and blue and it worked pretty
well<00:00:55.980> because<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.640> helped<00:00:56.910> me<00:00:56.940> look<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.300> the

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
well because it helped me look at the

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.689 
well because it helped me look at the
propellers<00:00:57.870> and<00:00:58.739> which<00:00:59.010> direction<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> was

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
propellers and which direction I was

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:02.029 
propellers and which direction I was
flying<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.840> eventually<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.440> might<00:01:01.620> have<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
flying and eventually you might have to

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.910 
flying and eventually you might have to
replace<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.670> motor<00:01:03.030> on<00:01:03.359> your<00:01:03.449> cyma<00:01:04.140> which<00:01:04.710> is

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
replace a motor on your cyma which is

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.330 
replace a motor on your cyma which is
actually<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.610> too<00:01:05.880> bad<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:06.299> do<00:01:07.040> the<00:01:08.040> hardest

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
actually not too bad to do the hardest

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.550 
actually not too bad to do the hardest
part<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.670> waiting<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:09.930> weeks<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
part is waiting the two weeks for the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.800 
part is waiting the two weeks for the
motor<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.920> come<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.310> but<00:01:11.640> you'll<00:01:12.270> need<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.570> bust

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
motor to come in but you'll need to bust

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.960 
motor to come in but you'll need to bust
out<00:01:13.049> your<00:01:13.080> soldering<00:01:13.740> iron<00:01:13.890> once<00:01:14.610> you've<00:01:14.760> got

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
out your soldering iron once you've got

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.929 
out your soldering iron once you've got
your<00:01:15.150> new<00:01:15.270> motors<00:01:15.659> in<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.820> disconnect<00:01:17.820> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
your new motors in and disconnect the

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.280 
your new motors in and disconnect the
old<00:01:18.060> motor<00:01:18.330> take<00:01:18.990> off<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> top<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:21.290> Padre

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
old motor take off the top and Padre

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.929 
old motor take off the top and Padre
pointed<00:01:22.650> out<00:01:22.740> there's<00:01:23.009> an<00:01:23.159> easier<00:01:23.549> way<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.700> do

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
pointed out there's an easier way to do

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.429 
pointed out there's an easier way to do
this<00:01:24.119> and<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.630> D<00:01:24.810> solder<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.229> wires

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
this and that's the D solder the wires

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.249 
this and that's the D solder the wires
from<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.799> board<00:01:26.159> but<00:01:26.939> as<00:01:27.240> I<00:01:27.600> had<00:01:28.020> not<00:01:28.200> thought

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
from the board but as I had not thought

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.950 
from the board but as I had not thought
of<00:01:28.500> this<00:01:28.740> before<00:01:28.979> I<00:01:29.220> recording<00:01:29.850> I<00:01:30.030> cut<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
of this before I recording I cut the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.440 
of this before I recording I cut the
wires<00:01:31.170> stripped<00:01:32.100> them<00:01:32.310> use<00:01:32.970> some<00:01:33.210> heat<00:01:33.390> shrink

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
wires stripped them use some heat shrink

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.859 
wires stripped them use some heat shrink
and<00:01:34.159> reattach<00:01:35.159> the<00:01:35.520> the<00:01:36.000> new<00:01:36.150> motor<00:01:36.420> that<00:01:36.689> way

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
and reattach the the new motor that way

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.640 
and reattach the the new motor that way
now<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:37.860> motors<00:01:38.579> do<00:01:39.650> rotate

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
now the motors do rotate

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.389 
now the motors do rotate
counterclockwise<00:01:41.570> or<00:01:42.570> clockwise<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.250> you'll

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
counterclockwise or clockwise but you'll

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.630 
counterclockwise or clockwise but you'll
want<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.759> match<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.720> color<00:01:45.750> code<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:47.070> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
want to match up the color code the the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.090 
want to match up the color code the the
color<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> wire<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> wire<00:01:49.170> so<00:01:49.950> if

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
color of the wire with the wire so if

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
laying around that's what I did to

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.280 
laying around that's what I did to
solder<00:02:44.130> to<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> board<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.390> on<00:02:45.600> most<00:02:45.810> antennas

there'll<00:02:46.500> be<00:02:46.530> a<00:02:46.709> shielding<00:02:47.670> that<00:02:47.700> you'll<00:02:48.030> need

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
there'll be a shielding that you'll need

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.930 
there'll be a shielding that you'll need
to<00:02:48.239> peel<00:02:48.630> back<00:02:49.100> connect<00:02:50.100> it<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> smaller

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:55.430 
soldered the battery cables back to the

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.520 
soldered the battery cables back to the
back<00:03:56.430> part<00:03:57.060> of<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.239> case<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:57.750> then<00:03:58.500> you

00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:58.530 
back part of the case and then you

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:02.199 
back part of the case and then you
should<00:03:59.299> be<00:04:00.299> able<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.720> test<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.260> out<00:04:01.410> now

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:02.209 
should be able to test it out now

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.569 
should be able to test it out now
keeping<00:04:03.209> our<00:04:03.299> fingers<00:04:03.480> crossed<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.590> test<00:04:05.370> out

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:05.579 
keeping our fingers crossed I test out

00:04:05.579 --> 00:04:07.789 
keeping our fingers crossed I test out
the<00:04:05.910> new<00:04:05.940> antenna<00:04:06.390> with<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.840> cyma<00:04:07.079> and<00:04:07.380> it

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:07.799 
the new antenna with the cyma and it

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.300 
the new antenna with the cyma and it
works<00:04:08.660> it's<00:04:09.660> just<00:04:09.780> as<00:04:10.079> responsive<00:04:10.680> as<00:04:10.890> before

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
works it's just as responsive as before

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:12.770 
works it's just as responsive as before
at<00:04:11.489> close<00:04:11.700> range<00:04:12.000> but<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.540> biggest

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
at close range but the biggest

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.250 
at close range but the biggest
difference<00:04:13.110> is<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.459> fly<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.880> at<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> point

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
difference is I can fly to at a point

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.680 
difference is I can fly to at a point
that<00:04:16.470> I<00:04:16.530> can't<00:04:16.890> see<00:04:17.100> it<00:04:17.220> anymore<00:04:17.459> so<00:04:18.239> that's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
that I can't see it anymore so that's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.750 
that I can't see it anymore so that's
far<00:04:18.989> enough<00:04:19.109> for<00:04:19.440> me<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.829> that<00:04:20.100> definitely

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
far enough for me and that definitely

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:24.590 
far enough for me and that definitely
extended<00:04:21.539> the<00:04:21.690> range<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:22.200> the<00:04:22.349> syma
