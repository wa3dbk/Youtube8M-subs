length<00:00:28.160> it<00:00:28.520> to<00:00:28.669> really<00:00:28.879> hit<00:00:28.969> a<00:00:29.029> double<00:00:29.660> leg<00:00:29.779> and

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:30.079 
length it to really hit a double leg and

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:32.380 
length it to really hit a double leg and
if<00:00:30.739> I'm<00:00:30.890> within<00:00:31.160> an<00:00:31.309> arm's<00:00:31.460> length<00:00:31.579> guess<00:00:32.210> what

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
if I'm within an arm's length guess what

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.970 
if I'm within an arm's length guess what
he's<00:00:32.509> got<00:00:32.660> arms<00:00:32.899> he<00:00:33.020> can<00:00:33.050> hit<00:00:33.320> me<00:00:33.440> with<00:00:33.620> it<00:00:33.739> and

the<00:01:31.180> low<00:01:31.300> single<00:01:31.540> that's<00:01:32.380> exactly<00:01:32.920> why<00:01:33.040> you

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
the low single that's exactly why you

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.590 
the low single that's exactly why you
don't<00:01:33.250> see<00:01:33.460> a<00:01:33.490> lot<00:01:33.700> of<00:01:33.730> guys<00:01:33.880> shoot<00:01:34.120> that<00:01:34.300> shot

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
don't see a lot of guys shoot that shot

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.420 
don't see a lot of guys shoot that shot
because<00:01:35.080> it's<00:01:35.440> pretty<00:01:35.650> easy<00:01:35.800> to<00:01:35.950> carry<00:01:36.250> your

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
because it's pretty easy to carry your

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:38.700
