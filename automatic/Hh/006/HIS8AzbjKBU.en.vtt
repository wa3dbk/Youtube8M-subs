not the chair the actual chair i'm going

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.260 
not the chair the actual chair i'm going
to<00:01:25.080> get<00:01:25.170> a<00:01:25.200> real<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.549> just<00:01:26.549> showing<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:26.880> where

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
to get a real one just showing you where

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.510 
to get a real one just showing you where
the<00:01:27.540> light<00:01:27.720> drops<00:01:28.049> as<00:01:28.229> well<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.650> hopefully

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
the light drops as well but hopefully

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.700 
the light drops as well but hopefully
this<00:01:29.850> will<00:01:30.000> not<00:01:30.150> be<00:01:30.180> too<00:01:30.570> bad<00:01:30.810> that<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.619> be

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this will not be too bad that it will be

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.440 
this will not be too bad that it will be
in<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:32.070> between<00:01:32.369> entryways<00:01:32.880> but<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.299> is

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
in in between entryways but this is

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.999 
in in between entryways but this is
where<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.780> pc<00:01:34.110> will<00:01:34.320> be<00:01:34.470> where<00:01:34.710> the<00:01:34.829> magic

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
where the pc will be where the magic

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.590 
where the pc will be where the magic
