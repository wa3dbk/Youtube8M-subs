00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.069
 Winners leave WiMAX at all and he does not order anything around but as soon as we do 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.099
 Having seen pictures of Brummifahrer on and their lost cargo 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.589
 Domino said that Gibson "is not that incredible for several 

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.720
 Motorists who probably must have had Gundersen guardian angels right away 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.460
 otherwise it is not to be explained that they put theirs briefly on 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.720
 Crates or punctured could survive tens of thousands of desolate 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.720
 on the highway and then that 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.640
 Here, a tire makes itself independent 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.629
 more often over the Fairfield motorway a parked car just barely 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.240
 too fast in the curve a vice loses the charged further 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.490
 serious accident on the a 4 a timber truck has lost tree trunks 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.490
 two people are dying 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:04.360
 About 2500 accidents of this type are registered per year cargo on the road surface 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.830
 represents a big danger 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.360
 Jens Wolf got caught on the highway in the morning on his way to work 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:12.850
 want 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.800
 a the knee was there 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.940
 Demands taken under exploiters 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.900
 in a parking lot he stops and looked 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.130
 for Worms 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.880
 Like a sportsman has a two-meter-long steel rod in his 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.410
 Small car drilled 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.250
 she is part of a construction fence 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:32.990
 and probably comes from 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.939
 I'm from such a truck 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:37.610
 with open loading area 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.790
 it's already so all millions in height 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.430
 a few days through the head is also the special of the years that you yourself 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.400
 has little influence 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.040
 just as in normal countries, a business trip comes to an abrupt end as well 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.740
 he lies on the highway 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.740
 a piece of metal against 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.120
 how to come to me and I thought so 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.450
 now is time 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.580
 It was DSDS 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.350
 so the accident has probably expired a truck loses the disease 

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:12.999
 several cars drive over it 

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:14.880
 one would blow her up 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.080
 and she bumps into the vehicle a little more pace and the plank would have 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.439
 affected the driver 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:24.260
 on the left side on the passenger side he both 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.640
 Sun the series really directly percent to me come to me so that 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.369
 Things that beheaded me 

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:36.089
 we meet our Schieder from the General Association of Insurers he has 

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:39.759
 collected over years in photos with accidents caused by lost cargo 

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:44.860
 These steel tubes pierce the cab during a braking maneuver 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.450
 and crash into a bus, miraculously nobody gets hurt 

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.060
 this truck has fallen into skidding 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.069
 fourth against the guardrail a ton of heavy disease flies on the 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.589
 Oncoming lane and smashes this car 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.879
 the passenger dies the survivor survives heavily injured 

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:07.819
 the giant stuff is that was in danger 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:10.869
 do not understand that heavy cargo does not secure itself 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.379
 So that you ask very intense questions why you do not charge 

00:03:15.379 --> 00:03:19.789
 secured or inadequate if his vision is so difficult 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:24.009
 that can not be moved worse is the Dekra with 3 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:27.009
 image-judgmental 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:33.779
 the first unsecured held in the middle of a simple cross ford 

00:03:33.779 --> 00:03:38.159
 the back on Andy Schleck tries the sharp edges are extra 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.079
 protected 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.079
 then the crash 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:47.309
 Bild APA Deputy Klaus stays lying 

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:49.629
 a tenant in travels the location 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.779
 this and the unsecured popping against the cab 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:04:01.489
 For some truck drivers, the danger of their cargo seems new 

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:02.109
 his 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:04.369
 Police check on the a4 

00:04:04.369 --> 00:04:08.749
 this driver transports steel pipes and profiles it is unsecured 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.409
 who won her once 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:15.409
 we want and we have to want to get rid of more 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:17.949
 Accident site Brücker 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:21.949
 the loading height of a truck would have been Christian Meier almost doomed here 

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:26.879
 if now driven on this track where the construction of the bridge ran along 

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.480
 Having gone a long way, let the Englishman say, 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.910
 Metal strikes in the 2 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:37.910
 a massive cast iron seized bursts away 

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:41.069
 through the windscreen 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:43.889
 and lands on the dashboard 

00:04:43.889 --> 00:04:45.390
 the street 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:48.590
 a debris field fortunately there is hardly any traffic 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:53.130
 the sharp-edged piece of metal has Christian Meier until today it depends 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.379
 as one would have met Aigner 

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:57.430
 Hildegard 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.960
 Rebers taken care of 

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.560
 even more adventurous 

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.889
 the load securing with private individuals 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.620
 this wooden transport could just be stopped by the police 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:14.349
 here it came to a crash, the plates slip while braking forward 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:18.360
 beaten first the hacker then the driver's windshield will be with 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.309
 pressed the seat on the steering wheel 

00:05:20.309 --> 00:05:23.309
 remains unhurt 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:30.389
 this is what a crash with an unsecured charge looks like at tempo 50 

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:33.680
 the beer tent set around the screen becomes a bullet 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.190
 the rest of the cargo flies through the interior of the bottles splintering 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:47.749
 a hardware store with them adds up as coach Roland Rauchbach we look 

00:05:47.749 --> 00:05:49.529
 Customers when loaded too 

00:05:49.529 --> 00:05:53.960
 this van has several 40 kilos of sacks in the back of the truck bed 

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:56.309
 strengthens lots of space lots 

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:58.629
 from the Norwegian we are like that 

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:01.849
 new tools would become clearer Euro and the least that would be a heart 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:03.369
 Feeling is but that changes 

00:06:03.369 --> 00:06:07.119
 who will support nearly four sons of mission play 

00:06:07.119 --> 00:06:11.129
 Of course the sacks of smoke and heat travel are not that much 

00:06:11.129 --> 00:06:13.409
 beautiful ProVital of the world 

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:17.209
 This is how heavy tool parts and tubes behave during a crash 

00:06:17.209 --> 00:06:19.460
 pickup 

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:23.560
 This couple has bought concrete parts and stowed in the trunk 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:26.830
 to free in the Portuguese quarter Kant Hölzer 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:29.210
 also the cross-dangerous

 the Rheintöchtern the back seat is set in motion 

00:06:34.189 --> 00:06:39.189
 the tip of the expert when the back bank is free both times tight 

00:06:39.189 --> 00:06:43.459
 possible even cross that gives the back seat and the cargo stop 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.610
 The bulky goods such as squared timbers would be down so they can not get away 

00:06:50.649 --> 00:06:51.789
 lash down 

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:55.219
 because you do not always have to be clear 

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:58.409
 July even supposedly easy things are fastened 

00:06:58.409 --> 00:07:00.599
 this water bottle to the dangerous
