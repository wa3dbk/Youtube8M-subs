00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
I'm going to tease this part if you

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.830 
I'm going to tease this part if you
don't<00:01:16.380> have<00:01:16.470> bangs<00:01:16.740> I<00:01:17.390> wouldn't<00:01:18.390> tease<00:01:18.600> it<00:01:18.780> i

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
don't have bangs I wouldn't tease it i

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.140 
don't have bangs I wouldn't tease it i
mean<00:01:18.990> i<00:01:19.049> never<00:01:19.140> did<00:01:19.500> until<00:01:19.680> i<00:01:19.830> had<00:01:20.040> bangs<00:01:20.369> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
mean i never did until i had bangs it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.640 
mean i never did until i had bangs it
doesn't<00:01:21.420> necessarily<00:01:21.810> make<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.960> easier<00:01:22.409> i

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
doesn't necessarily make it easier i

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.830 
doesn't necessarily make it easier i
don't<00:01:22.799> think<00:01:23.119> it<00:01:24.119> just<00:01:24.240> helps<00:01:24.570> keep<00:01:24.750> your

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
don't think it just helps keep your

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.230 
don't think it just helps keep your
bangs<00:01:25.110> in<00:01:25.580> place

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:32.240 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.630 

and<00:01:32.450> also<00:01:33.049> if<00:01:33.409> you<00:01:33.500> bang<00:01:33.829> something<00:01:34.460> that

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
and also if you bang something that

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.149 
and also if you bang something that
helps<00:01:35.030> is<00:01:35.390> twisting<00:01:36.049> your<00:01:36.079> hair<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.829> take

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:37.159 
helps is twisting your hair so you take

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.529 
difficult for me to mold so I like to
take<00:01:59.570> mine<00:01:59.840> in<00:02:00.049> an<00:02:00.140> angle<00:02:00.560> right<00:02:00.740> over<00:02:00.799> my

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:01.539 
take mine in an angle right over my

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:06.190 
take mine in an angle right over my
eyebrow<00:02:02.539> and<00:02:03.289> I<00:02:03.590> make<00:02:03.770> a<00:02:03.799> loop<00:02:04.189> and<00:02:04.959> then<00:02:05.959> just

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
eyebrow and I make a loop and then just

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:16.230 
eyebrow and I make a loop and then just
roll<00:02:06.380> that<00:02:06.500> loop<00:02:06.740> up<00:02:06.920> towards<00:02:07.250> your<00:02:07.280> head

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:18.300 

and<00:02:16.360> then<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.050> closer<00:02:17.290> you<00:02:17.530> get<00:02:17.680> to<00:02:17.740> your<00:02:18.040> head

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
and then the closer you get to your head

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.400 
and then the closer you get to your head
the<00:02:18.790> more<00:02:19.060> straight<00:02:19.510> out<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.960> want<00:02:20.140> to<00:02:20.200> pull

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
the more straight out you want to pull

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
the more straight out you want to pull
it

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.300 

and<00:02:26.640> then<00:02:27.180> lay<00:02:27.359> it<00:02:27.420> against<00:02:27.719> your<00:02:27.810> head<00:02:28.310> and

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
and then lay it against your head and

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.830 
and then lay it against your head and
hold<00:02:30.000> it<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.239> your<00:02:30.269> finger<00:02:30.810> and<00:02:32.060> I<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.540> to

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
hold it with your finger and I like to

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.979 
hold it with your finger and I like to
use<00:02:34.019> a<00:02:34.379> large<00:02:34.650> bobby<00:02:34.980> pin<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.670> think<00:02:36.659> it's<00:02:36.810> much

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
use a large bobby pin I think it's much

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.349 
use a large bobby pin I think it's much
easier<00:02:39.109> but<00:02:40.370> little<00:02:41.370> bobby<00:02:41.519> pins<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.939> just<00:02:42.209> as

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
easier but little bobby pins to just as

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.690 
easier but little bobby pins to just as
well

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.910 

so<00:02:48.239> I<00:02:48.300> put<00:02:48.480> a<00:02:48.510> large<00:02:48.750> body<00:02:48.959> pin<00:02:49.230> from<00:02:49.379> one<00:02:49.650> side

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
so I put a large body pin from one side

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.140 
so I put a large body pin from one side
and<00:02:50.340> then<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.390> small<00:02:52.050> bobby<00:02:52.349> pin<00:02:53.060> from<00:02:54.060> the

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
and then a small bobby pin from the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.440 
and then a small bobby pin from the
other<00:02:54.510> side

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:04.280 

and<00:03:00.450> then<00:03:00.750> let<00:03:00.930> go<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:03.450> can<00:03:03.840> pull<00:03:04.170> it

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
and then let go and you can pull it

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.630 
and then let go and you can pull it
apart<00:03:04.350> and<00:03:04.940> mold<00:03:05.940> it<00:03:06.060> however<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.540> want<00:03:07.640> if

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
apart and mold it however you want if

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.100 
apart and mold it however you want if
you<00:03:09.560> don't<00:03:10.560> have<00:03:10.770> bangs<00:03:11.690> you<00:03:12.690> can<00:03:12.840> make<00:03:12.990> this

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
you don't have bangs you can make this

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.530 
you don't have bangs you can make this
part<00:03:13.440> much<00:03:13.680> bigger<00:03:14.010> but<00:03:14.400> if<00:03:14.730> you<00:03:14.880> have<00:03:15.000> banks<00:03:15.450> I

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
part much bigger but if you have banks I

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.780 
part much bigger but if you have banks I
suggest<00:03:15.930> keeping<00:03:16.050> this<00:03:16.350> pretty<00:03:17.070> small<00:03:17.490> on

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
suggest keeping this pretty small on

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.390 
suggest keeping this pretty small on
because<00:03:18.330> that's<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.630> only<00:03:18.720> way<00:03:18.990> i<00:03:19.020> have<00:03:19.230> found

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
because that's the only way i have found

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.430 
because that's the only way i have found
to<00:03:20.400> keep<00:03:21.030> it<00:03:21.210> without<00:03:21.540> my<00:03:21.810> bangs<00:03:22.050> like

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
to keep it without my bangs like

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.080 
to keep it without my bangs like
shooting<00:03:22.920> out<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:23.340> I<00:03:23.430> keep<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:23.700> part

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
shooting out is if I keep this part

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.920 
shooting out is if I keep this part
relatively<00:03:24.570> small<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:25.830> prior<00:03:26.160> to<00:03:26.930> having

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
relatively small but prior to having

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.840 
relatively small but prior to having
bangs<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.440> used<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> make<00:03:28.800> this<00:03:29.010> little<00:03:29.490> loop

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850

quite large and also if you want this
part<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:32.820> stick<00:03:33.150> up<00:03:33.270> more<00:03:33.510> you<00:03:33.690> can<00:03:33.810> just<00:03:34.020> tease

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260
