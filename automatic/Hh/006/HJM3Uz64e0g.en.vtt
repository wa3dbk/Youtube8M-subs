00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
so it's all whirlwind of destruction and

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.170 
so it's all whirlwind of destruction and
the<00:02:22.820> style<00:02:23.820> is<00:02:24.120> elemental<00:02:24.750> Android<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:26.100> if<00:02:27.000> you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
the style is elemental Android so if you

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.030 
the style is elemental Android so if you
can<00:02:27.330> see<00:02:27.570> the<00:02:27.810> gear<00:02:28.140> is<00:02:28.350> actually<00:02:29.060> what<00:02:30.060> is<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
can see the gear is actually what is the

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:37.310 
can see the gear is actually what is the
base<00:02:32.040> is<00:02:32.420> 90<00:02:33.620> PvP<00:02:34.620> item<00:02:35.459> level<00:02:35.610> and<00:02:36.080> all<00:02:37.080> of<00:02:37.200> it

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
base is 90 PvP item level and all of it

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.300 
base is 90 PvP item level and all of it
is<00:02:37.350> 90<00:02:38.010> actually<00:02:39.020> and<00:02:40.020> I<00:02:40.200> do<00:02:40.260> got<00:02:40.590> knots<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.160> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
is 90 actually and I do got knots on it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.070 
is 90 actually and I do got knots on it
you<00:02:41.459> guys<00:02:41.580> see<00:02:41.820> these<00:02:42.030> little<00:02:42.270> synthetic<00:02:42.600> mod

checked the PVE vendors yet I'm going to
actually<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:58.080> just<00:02:58.290> reminded<00:02:58.740> me<00:02:58.770> and<00:02:59.100> see

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
if we're able to buy these with like

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.410 
if we're able to buy these with like
marks<00:03:02.610> of<00:03:02.730> triumph<00:03:03.060> now<00:03:03.209> for<00:03:03.600> the<00:03:04.459> PVE<00:03:05.459> armor

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
but if so that pretty much takes out

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.180 
but if so that pretty much takes out
like<00:03:09.320> EXO<00:03:10.320> farming<00:03:10.709> and<00:03:10.830> stuff<00:03:10.980> like<00:03:11.130> that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190

like EXO farming and stuff like that
guys<00:03:11.550> because<00:03:12.360> i<00:03:12.600> know<00:03:12.660> i<00:03:12.840> would<00:03:13.170> rather<00:03:13.350> and

guys because i know i would rather and

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.680 
guys because i know i would rather and
these<00:03:14.370> are<00:03:14.550> real<00:03:14.790> cheap<00:03:15.030> actually<00:03:15.510> they're

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
these are real cheap actually they're

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.390 
these are real cheap actually they're
not<00:03:15.870> that<00:03:16.080> expensive<00:03:16.200> i<00:03:16.680> can<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.130> here<00:03:17.160> and

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
not that expensive i can go in here and

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.910 
not that expensive i can go in here and
show<00:03:17.610> you<00:03:17.670> guys<00:03:17.850> a<00:03:17.910> maxim<00:03:18.540> real<00:03:19.380> quick<00:03:19.680> how

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
show you guys a maxim real quick how

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.110 
show you guys a maxim real quick how
much<00:03:20.100> they<00:03:20.280> cost

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.530 

okay<00:03:28.120> right<00:03:28.480> down<00:03:28.660> here<00:03:28.960> and<00:03:29.650> if<00:03:29.860> you<00:03:29.920> can<00:03:30.190> see

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
okay right down here and if you can see

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.340 
okay right down here and if you can see
synthetic<00:03:31.540> my<00:03:31.690> 5s<00:03:32.440> and<00:03:33.360> there's<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.480> precision

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
synthetic my 5s and there's a precision

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.770 
synthetic my 5s and there's a precision
and<00:03:35.530> might<00:03:36.220> one<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.790> guess<00:03:37.180> there's<00:03:37.390> not<00:03:37.570> really

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:37.780 
and might one I guess there's not really

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.400 
and might one I guess there's not really
that<00:03:37.900> much<00:03:38.110> of<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.560> variety<00:03:38.830> in<00:03:39.130> here<00:03:39.430> but

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
that much of a variety in here but

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:44.130 
that much of a variety in here but
anyway<00:03:41.410> it<00:03:41.710> it<00:03:42.670> beats<00:03:43.000> elam<00:03:43.390> XL<00:03:43.780> farming

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
anyway it it beats elam XL farming

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:45.990 
anyway it it beats elam XL farming
especially<00:03:44.320> for<00:03:44.710> the<00:03:44.770> red<00:03:44.950> ones<00:03:45.190> you<00:03:45.820> could

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
especially for the red ones you could

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.880 
especially for the red ones you could
build<00:03:46.150> pure<00:03:46.390> precision<00:03:46.870> or<00:03:46.990> PMI<00:03:47.410> which<00:03:47.440> ever

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:47.890 
build pure precision or PMI which ever

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.210 
build pure precision or PMI which ever
you<00:03:48.190> know<00:03:48.790> your<00:03:49.030> character<00:03:49.180> is<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:50.100> if<00:03:51.100> you

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:51.220 
you know your character is and if you

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:52.800 
you know your character is and if you
guys<00:03:51.370> can<00:03:51.550> see<00:03:51.580> they<00:03:51.790> only<00:03:51.940> cost<00:03:52.150> 50<00:03:52.480> marks<00:03:52.720> of

the world shutting down here in 25
minutes<00:04:07.870> it<00:04:08.110> shouldn't<00:04:08.410> take<00:04:08.440> that<00:04:08.650> long<00:04:08.709> to

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
minutes it shouldn't take that long to

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.920 
minutes it shouldn't take that long to
make<00:04:09.100> this<00:04:09.250> video<00:04:09.520> or<00:04:09.640> anything<00:04:10.000> so<00:04:10.240> I<00:04:10.510> should

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
be good but anyway let me go into my

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.030 
be good but anyway let me go into my
inventory<00:04:13.270> again<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:14.050> like<00:04:14.590> i<00:04:14.620> said<00:04:14.770> this

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
inventory again and like i said this

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.289 
inventory again and like i said this
gear<00:04:15.310> is<00:04:15.340> a<00:04:15.760> pvp<00:04:16.690> 90<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:17.880> if<00:04:18.880> i<00:04:18.970> go<00:04:19.120> into<00:04:19.239> my

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
gear is a pvp 90 and if i go into my

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.070 
gear is a pvp 90 and if i go into my
stats<00:04:19.739> my<00:04:20.739> combat<00:04:21.160> rating<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.730> 90<00:04:22.600> so<00:04:22.780> i<00:04:22.810> guess

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
stats my combat rating is 90 so i guess

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.100 
stats my combat rating is 90 so i guess
90<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:24.040> the<00:04:24.190> new<00:04:24.370> max<00:04:24.640> I<00:04:24.910> do<00:04:24.970> not<00:04:25.240> all<00:04:25.540> my<00:04:25.810> mods

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
90 is the new max I do not all my mods

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:28.800 
90 is the new max I do not all my mods
and<00:04:26.530> but<00:04:27.130> I<00:04:27.160> use<00:04:27.760> pure<00:04:28.060> precision<00:04:28.510> on<00:04:28.600> all

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
and but I use pure precision on all

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.840 
and but I use pure precision on all
homes<00:04:29.110> even<00:04:29.320> like<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.950> blue<00:04:30.190> ones<00:04:30.460> are<00:04:30.610> and

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
homes even like the blue ones are and

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.520 
homes even like the blue ones are and
stuff<00:04:31.360> like<00:04:31.540> that<00:04:31.600> but<00:04:31.810> i<00:04:32.080> don't<00:04:32.290> think<00:04:32.350> that

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
stuff like that but i don't think that

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.100 
stuff like that but i don't think that
affects<00:04:32.950> the<00:04:33.100> level<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.610> mine<00:04:33.940> in<00:04:34.480> my<00:04:34.750> affect

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
affects the level it mine in my affect

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:36.870 
affects the level it mine in my affect
the<00:04:35.260> level<00:04:35.380> by<00:04:35.620> a<00:04:35.650> couple<00:04:36.190> but<00:04:36.340> i<00:04:36.370> don't<00:04:36.640> think

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:36.880 
the level by a couple but i don't think

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.400 
the level by a couple but i don't think
it<00:04:37.000> would<00:04:37.120> put<00:04:37.300> my<00:04:37.419> combat<00:04:37.810> rating<00:04:38.080> up<00:04:38.200> so

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
it would put my combat rating up so

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.200 
it would put my combat rating up so
pretty<00:04:39.010> sure<00:04:39.190> the<00:04:39.340> max<00:04:39.580> kind<00:04:39.790> of<00:04:39.850> iterating

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:40.210 
pretty sure the max kind of iterating

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:43.740 
pretty sure the max kind of iterating
for<00:04:40.390> pvp<00:04:40.810> after<00:04:41.800> this<00:04:41.979> new<00:04:42.220> update<00:04:42.400> 33<00:04:43.150> is<00:04:43.360> on

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.180 
precision is 1196 my might is pretty
high<00:05:35.540> actually<00:05:36.200> I<00:05:36.410> would<00:05:36.800> have<00:05:36.890> thought<00:05:37.040> it

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
high actually I would have thought it

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.620 
high actually I would have thought it
would<00:05:37.310> have<00:05:37.430> been<00:05:37.520> lower<00:05:37.790> since<00:05:38.120> I<00:05:38.240> went<00:05:38.390> look

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
would have been lower since I went look

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.480 
would have been lower since I went look
like<00:05:38.870> pure<00:05:39.170> precision<00:05:39.740> mobs<00:05:39.920> and<00:05:40.160> stuff<00:05:40.340> like

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
like pure precision mobs and stuff like

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.600 
like pure precision mobs and stuff like
that<00:05:40.550> but<00:05:40.880> it's<00:05:41.660> on<00:05:42.040> 2566<00:05:43.040> i'm<00:05:43.280> sure<00:05:43.430> you<00:05:43.520> guys

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
that but it's on 2566 i'm sure you guys

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.960 
that but it's on 2566 i'm sure you guys
see<00:05:44.030> all<00:05:44.180> this<00:05:44.360> anyway<00:05:44.680> but<00:05:45.680> i'm<00:05:46.550> not<00:05:46.760> really

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
see all this anyway but i'm not really

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.880 
see all this anyway but i'm not really
sure<00:05:47.090> what<00:05:47.420> the<00:05:47.570> old<00:05:47.750> toughness<00:05:48.260> armor<00:05:48.710> was

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
sure what the old toughness armor was

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:51.220 
sure what the old toughness armor was
because<00:05:49.190> i'm<00:05:49.310> not<00:05:49.430> a<00:05:49.490> big<00:05:49.760> PvP<00:05:50.270> player<00:05:50.510> i<00:05:50.780> play

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 
because i'm not a big PvP player i play

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:53.920 
because i'm not a big PvP player i play
more<00:05:51.440> PvE<00:05:51.770> so<00:05:52.580> I'm<00:05:52.940> not<00:05:53.090> really<00:05:53.150> sure<00:05:53.360> what<00:05:53.780> the

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:53.930 
more PvE so I'm not really sure what the

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.900 
more PvE so I'm not really sure what the
precision<00:05:54.410> are<00:05:54.620> the<00:05:54.860> toughness<00:05:55.250> was<00:05:55.610> on<00:05:55.760> the

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
precision are the toughness was on the

00:05:55.910 --> 00:06:00.580 
precision are the toughness was on the
other<00:05:55.970> gear<00:05:56.360> but<00:05:56.600> now<00:05:57.170> it<00:05:57.440> is<00:05:59.290> 2274<00:06:00.290> for<00:06:00.500> the

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
other gear but now it is 2274 for the

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.710 
other gear but now it is 2274 for the
dps<00:06:00.950> gear<00:06:00.980> and<00:06:01.400> I<00:06:02.090> think<00:06:02.360> that<00:06:02.540> you're<00:06:02.690> not

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:02.720 
dps gear and I think that you're not

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:05.710 
dps gear and I think that you're not
allowed<00:06:03.050> to<00:06:03.110> use<00:06:03.380> this<00:06:03.560> in<00:06:03.800> PvE<00:06:04.790> combat

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720 
allowed to use this in PvE combat

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.690 
allowed to use this in PvE combat
anymore<00:06:06.170> I<00:06:06.200> don't<00:06:06.410> really<00:06:07.100> know<00:06:07.340> how<00:06:07.370> that

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
anymore I don't really know how that

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.360 
anymore I don't really know how that
works<00:06:07.940> but<00:06:08.120> I'll<00:06:08.720> figure<00:06:09.380> it<00:06:09.530> out<00:06:09.680> and<00:06:09.950> let<00:06:10.010> you

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:10.370 
works but I'll figure it out and let you

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.060
