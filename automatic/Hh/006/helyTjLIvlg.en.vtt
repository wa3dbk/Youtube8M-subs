00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.390 
games so let's just get into the game
now<00:03:09.209> well<00:03:09.810> first<00:03:10.230> of<00:03:10.410> all<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.769> what<00:03:10.950> you<00:03:11.040> do<00:03:11.220> is

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:11.400 
now well first of all the what you do is

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.250 
now well first of all the what you do is
you<00:03:11.610> have<00:03:11.640> your<00:03:12.000> region<00:03:12.360> that<00:03:12.510> you<00:03:12.599> select<00:03:12.989> and

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
you have your region that you select and

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.559 
you have your region that you select and
you<00:03:13.410> start<00:03:13.650> building<00:03:14.010> your<00:03:14.099> roads<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.819> feels

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
you start building your roads it feels

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:17.780 
you start building your roads it feels
very<00:03:15.780> limited<00:03:16.530> because<00:03:16.650> once<00:03:17.010> you've<00:03:17.160> built<00:03:17.580> a

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
very limited because once you've built a

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.080 
very limited because once you've built a
city<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.950> basically<00:03:19.950> kicks<00:03:20.489> you<00:03:20.640> out<00:03:20.670> of<00:03:21.000> it

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090

city it basically kicks you out of it
and<00:03:21.269> you<00:03:21.360> got<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.599> go<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:21.720> a<00:03:21.810> different<00:03:22.049> region

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
and you got to go to a different region

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.890 
and you got to go to a different region
and<00:03:22.769> make<00:03:22.890> another<00:03:23.190> city<00:03:23.610> right<00:03:24.239> and<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.720> you

bunch of little houses around the town
hall<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:40.380> eventually<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:41.099> town<00:03:41.700> hall<00:03:41.940> is

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
hall but eventually that town hall is

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.850 
hall but eventually that town hall is
going<00:03:42.239> to<00:03:42.329> expand<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.989> big<00:03:43.260> so<00:03:43.530> it's<00:03:43.650> best

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
going to expand really big so it's best

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.400 
going to expand really big so it's best
to<00:03:44.010> give<00:03:44.130> it<00:03:44.250> like<00:03:44.400> a<00:03:44.430> huge<00:03:45.090> city<00:03:45.750> block<00:03:46.049> for

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
to give it like a huge city block for

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.900 
to give it like a huge city block for
that<00:03:46.530> town<00:03:46.769> hall<00:03:47.040> so<00:03:47.340> you<00:03:47.400> always<00:03:47.609> have<00:03:47.730> to

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
that town hall so you always have to

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.550 
that town hall so you always have to
think<00:03:47.940> about<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.359> you're<00:03:49.260> going<00:03:49.410> to<00:03:49.500> be

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
think about that you're going to be

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.710 
think about that you're going to be
bulldozing<00:03:50.280> a<00:03:50.340> lot<00:03:50.519> of<00:03:50.670> shit<00:03:50.910> as<00:03:51.120> you<00:03:51.299> expand

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
bulldozing a lot of shit as you expand

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.629 
bulldozing a lot of shit as you expand
and<00:03:51.930> there's<00:03:52.139> some<00:03:52.319> really<00:03:52.530> bad<00:03:52.920> things<00:03:53.250> in

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
and there's some really bad things in

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.640 
and there's some really bad things in
this<00:03:53.819> game<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.299> I<00:03:54.329> hate<00:03:54.720> it<00:03:55.049> doesn't<00:03:55.410> allow

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
this game that I hate it doesn't allow

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.590 
this game that I hate it doesn't allow
you<00:03:55.709> to<00:03:56.100> put<00:03:56.280> the<00:03:56.400> road<00:03:56.579> anywhere<00:03:57.209> you<00:03:57.239> want

00:03:57.590 --> 00:03:57.600 
you to put the road anywhere you want

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.500 
you to put the road anywhere you want
like<00:03:58.049> a<00:03:58.079> Sim<00:03:58.470> City<00:03:58.739> game<00:03:59.130> used<00:03:59.819> to<00:04:00.000> let<00:04:00.150> you<00:04:00.269> do

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
like a Sim City game used to let you do

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.000 
like a Sim City game used to let you do
like<00:04:00.870> that's<00:04:01.049> what<00:04:01.170> architects<00:04:01.680> would<00:04:01.859> have

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
like that's what architects would have

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.770 
like that's what architects would have
to<00:04:02.130> do<00:04:02.220> any<00:04:02.430> architects<00:04:02.910> ins<00:04:03.150> know<00:04:03.389> but<00:04:03.660> our

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
to do any architects ins know but our

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.840 
to do any architects ins know but our
contentions<00:04:04.350> anyone<00:04:04.680> yes<00:04:05.010> but<00:04:05.310> architects

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
contentions anyone yes but architects

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.550 
contentions anyone yes but architects
would<00:04:06.030> make<00:04:06.209> it<00:04:06.389> work<00:04:06.600> where<00:04:06.870> they<00:04:07.139> want<00:04:07.350> it<00:04:07.440> to

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
would make it work where they want it to

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:10.160 
would make it work where they want it to
work<00:04:07.680> and<00:04:07.920> that's<00:04:08.010> why<00:04:08.250> are<00:04:08.519> ya<00:04:08.959> stupids<00:04:09.959> do

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
work and that's why are ya stupids do

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.170 
work and that's why are ya stupids do
that<00:04:10.350> exactly<00:04:10.889> instead<00:04:11.340> but<00:04:11.579> then<00:04:11.790> i<00:04:12.060> wouldn't

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
that exactly instead but then i wouldn't

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:13.879 
that exactly instead but then i wouldn't
i<00:04:12.569> would<00:04:12.870> make<00:04:13.049> the<00:04:13.170> decision<00:04:13.560> to<00:04:13.590> put<00:04:13.799> it

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:13.889 
i would make the decision to put it

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:15.289 
i would make the decision to put it
there<00:04:14.069> then<00:04:14.310> if<00:04:14.489> you<00:04:14.609> were<00:04:14.730> just<00:04:14.970> bleeding

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
there then if you were just bleeding

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.300 
there then if you were just bleeding
like<00:04:15.630> if<00:04:15.780> there's<00:04:16.019> a<00:04:16.079> big<00:04:16.350> block<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.739> stone

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:17.310 
like if there's a big block of stone

00:04:17.310 --> 00:04:18.560 
like if there's a big block of stone
that<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:17.639> can't<00:04:17.850> cut<00:04:18.030> through<00:04:18.180> you'd<00:04:18.359> build

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
that you can't cut through you'd build

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.300 
that you can't cut through you'd build
like<00:04:18.750> you<00:04:18.900> go<00:04:19.079> around<00:04:19.200> right<00:04:19.620> exactly<00:04:20.130> that's

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
like you go around right exactly that's

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:22.310 
like you go around right exactly that's
what<00:04:20.459> it's<00:04:20.669> doing<00:04:21.090> but<00:04:21.329> it<00:04:21.479> that's<00:04:21.720> kind<00:04:22.200> of

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
what it's doing but it that's kind of

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.510 
what it's doing but it that's kind of
what<00:04:22.470> it's<00:04:22.560> doing<00:04:22.830> maybe<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.190> can<00:04:23.340> hire<00:04:23.460> a

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
what it's doing maybe you can hire a

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.510 
what it's doing maybe you can hire a
crew<00:04:24.060> to<00:04:24.840> actually<00:04:25.229> blast<00:04:25.560> out<00:04:25.860> the<00:04:26.070> highway

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.520 
crew to actually blast out the highway

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.830 
crew to actually blast out the highway
and<00:04:26.729> then<00:04:26.940> you<00:04:27.090> can<00:04:27.270> put<00:04:27.419> it<00:04:27.510> through<00:04:27.690> and

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
and then you can put it through and

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.270 
and then you can put it through and
maybe<00:04:27.990> you<00:04:28.080> have<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.260> pay<00:04:28.440> for<00:04:28.680> that<00:04:28.710> why

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
maybe you have to pay for that why

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.710 
maybe you have to pay for that why
didn't<00:04:29.490> they<00:04:29.580> take<00:04:29.760> it<00:04:29.910> to<00:04:30.030> that<00:04:30.060> level<00:04:30.210> you

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
didn't they take it to that level you

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.140 
didn't they take it to that level you
can<00:04:30.870> truly<00:04:31.110> build<00:04:31.500> wherever<00:04:31.830> you<00:04:31.919> want<00:04:32.160> but

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
can truly build wherever you want but

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.120 
can truly build wherever you want but
sometimes<00:04:33.539> you<00:04:33.840> can't<00:04:34.050> like<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:34.620> found<00:04:34.889> that<00:04:35.070> I

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
sometimes you can't like I found that I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.980 
sometimes you can't like I found that I
was<00:04:35.220> just<00:04:35.430> playing<00:04:35.760> the<00:04:35.880> game<00:04:35.990> really

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
was just playing the game really

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.320 
was just playing the game really
enjoying<00:04:37.560> it<00:04:37.800> I<00:04:38.010> was<00:04:38.280> watching<00:04:38.610> the<00:04:38.700> city<00:04:38.910> grow

enjoying it I was watching the city grow

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.960 
enjoying it I was watching the city grow
that<00:04:39.720> I<00:04:39.780> built<00:04:40.200> but<00:04:41.010> that<00:04:41.190> was<00:04:41.400> it<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.729> gotta

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
that I built but that was it I gotta

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:43.730 
that I built but that was it I gotta
reroute<00:04:42.300> the<00:04:42.479> water<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.960> sewer<00:04:43.169> system<00:04:43.260> is

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
reroute the water the sewer system is

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:45.529 
reroute the water the sewer system is
not<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.160> game<00:04:44.370> if<00:04:44.580> that's<00:04:44.849> the<00:04:45.060> game<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.419> was

00:04:45.529 --> 00:04:45.539 
not the game if that's the game it was

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.900 
not the game if that's the game it was
ok<00:04:45.960> those<00:04:46.380> challenges<00:04:46.830> pop<00:04:47.070> up<00:04:47.310> and<00:04:47.550> again

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
ok those challenges pop up and again

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.250 
ok those challenges pop up and again
