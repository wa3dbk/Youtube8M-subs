00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.969
 very good to all people here the 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.880
 bank or in another chapter episode of 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:18.550
 the tyranny of the york king and washington and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.510
 good 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.510
 because who has done this 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.860
 fuck 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:35.860
 flip 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.800
 dead spots will not have 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.800
 l 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.420
 the men of north heart followed 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.140
 until the brothers fought well 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.140
 but the angle 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.610
 it gives you strength 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.550
 not immortality 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:05.239
 it gives me life I had never felt anything 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.380
 you must be careful, respect the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.110
 Power of tea 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.970
 a habit 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.909
 and he was right 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.130
 when worrying about the risks 

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.130
 I know I could beat anyone 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.840
 January 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.900
 ltm this destruction 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.590
 you must achieve it 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:41.090
 bratton that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.090
 if it's not you 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.990
 I am the only hope of my people 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.180
 the only hope of freedom 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.990
 is the only hope to keep 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.400
 Washington 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.480
 son of a bitch s 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.480
 they achieved everything 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.540
 the wolves were not on my side 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.709
 it seems that you are not 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.709
 what is boy taste 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.060
 where I have to go now to discover 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.060
 surely afterwards where I have 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:34.270
 where will the commanders and the 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.340
 washington and others 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:38.340
 he said he had to kill not also 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:49.240
 the one that is full of corpses shot 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:51.100
 horse this staff is not a cow and 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.150
 use a pencil 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:54.150
 the stone 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.250
 I have to listen to a conversation 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.090
 here 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.090
 If you do not see me 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.750
 but everything because of the wind 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.769
 no one loose corpses like I've already 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:16.769
 saying 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.970
 stability 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.920
 they are all the same yesterday they are strict 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.840
 a man for having dirty the musket 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:30.170
 study in favor of separating the weak 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.270
 but this is something else 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:38.820
 we are on the opposite side means 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:41.970
 that were not hard as a wall but at 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:46.010
 final fell I liked we do not have what 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.010
 worry do not be so often 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:53.510
 then wait for orders from the commander 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.530
 aznar and where they were in a kind of 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.530
 retirement until the king 

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:06.000
 almost caught me lad 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.269
 Well they caught me but I became invisible 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.760
 they ask me to fuck that one is attentive to the 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:13.319
 conversation and he does not know his 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.450
 around 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:21.609
 how it's worth then I was not here 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.569

 I was concentrated there doing 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.639

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:43.629

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.669
