in<00:02:05.140> the<00:02:05.979> game<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.940> is<00:02:07.090> a<00:02:07.209> miracle<00:02:07.479> oh<00:02:07.929> my<00:02:08.679> god

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
in the game this is a miracle oh my god

in the game this is a miracle oh my god
i<00:02:08.890> goes<00:02:09.039> through<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.220> axe<00:02:09.399> straight<00:02:09.759> down<00:02:10.000> do

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
i goes through the axe straight down do

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:12.449 
i goes through the axe straight down do
I<00:02:10.690> even<00:02:10.720> want<00:02:10.989> to<00:02:11.170> attempt<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.470> get<00:02:11.620> this<00:02:11.860> looks

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
I even want to attempt to get this looks

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.700 
I even want to attempt to get this looks
like<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.670> don't<00:02:12.730> have<00:02:12.940> it

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:23.990 

I<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:22.680> don't<00:02:22.860> understand<00:02:23.460> like<00:02:23.700> how<00:02:23.730> would

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
I just don't understand like how would

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.760 
I just don't understand like how would
anybody<00:02:24.300> ever<00:02:24.600> get<00:02:24.810> through<00:02:24.990> this<00:02:25.080> normally<00:02:25.560> I

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
anybody ever get through this normally I

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.350 
anybody ever get through this normally I
just<00:02:26.100> understand<00:02:26.550> this<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.790> like<00:02:26.910> the<00:02:27.330> most

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
just understand this is like the most

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.170 
just understand this is like the most
fun<00:02:27.600> why<00:02:28.500> why<00:02:29.070> does<00:02:29.190> he<00:02:29.310> just<00:02:29.490> just<00:02:29.850> lose

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
fun why why does he just just lose

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:31.670 
fun why why does he just just lose
momentum<00:02:30.420> in<00:02:30.810> midair<00:02:30.990> it's<00:02:31.290> like<00:02:31.380> it'd<00:02:31.500> be<00:02:31.650> one

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
momentum in midair it's like it'd be one

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.130 
momentum in midair it's like it'd be one
thing<00:02:31.890> if<00:02:32.130> he<00:02:32.640> already<00:02:32.820> had<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.360> momentum<00:02:33.690> or

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
thing if he already had the momentum or

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.480 
thing if he already had the momentum or
I<00:02:34.170> mean<00:02:34.650> if<00:02:34.770> you<00:02:34.830> can<00:02:34.950> see<00:02:35.040> if<00:02:35.100> you<00:02:35.160> just<00:02:35.280> had<00:02:35.370> no

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
I mean if you can see if you just had no

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.890 
I mean if you can see if you just had no
momentum<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:36.000> all<00:02:36.120> I<00:02:36.150> can<00:02:36.360> real<00:02:36.540> life<00:02:36.660> but

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:36.900 
momentum that all I can real life but

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.150 
momentum that all I can real life but
it's<00:02:36.990> like<00:02:37.110> they<00:02:37.230> decided<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.860> halfway

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
it's like they decided to halfway

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.400 
it's like they decided to halfway
