boxes<00:00:38.690> of<00:00:38.750> rack<00:00:39.020> in<00:00:39.260> one<00:00:39.530> single<00:00:39.920> pedal<00:00:40.220> with<00:00:40.610> a

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
boxes of rack in one single pedal with a

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.070 
boxes of rack in one single pedal with a
foot<00:00:40.910> switch<00:00:41.120> for<00:00:41.330> each<00:00:41.420> side<00:00:41.630> so<00:00:41.840> we<00:00:41.930> could

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
foot switch for each side so we could

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:43.870 
foot switch for each side so we could
cascade<00:00:42.559> them<00:00:42.710> into<00:00:42.890> each<00:00:42.980> other<00:00:43.190> and<00:00:43.370> it's

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
cascade them into each other and it's

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:45.580 
cascade them into each other and it's
basically<00:00:44.150> exactly<00:00:44.480> that<00:00:44.900> but<00:00:45.230> for<00:00:45.470> the

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
basically exactly that but for the

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.200 
basically exactly that but for the
public<00:00:45.800> release<00:00:46.160> they<00:00:46.370> actually<00:00:46.670> added<00:00:47.059> a

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210 
public release they actually added a

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.120 
public release they actually added a
little<00:00:47.960> 3-way<00:00:48.140> toggle<00:00:48.620> switch<00:00:48.800> on<00:00:48.920> each

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
little 3-way toggle switch on each

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.400 
little 3-way toggle switch on each
channel<00:00:49.520> for<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.880> sub<00:00:50.600> active<00:00:50.989> so<00:00:51.170> you<00:00:51.200> can

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
channel for the sub active so you can

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.479 
channel for the sub active so you can
bring<00:00:51.559> like<00:00:51.770> basically<00:00:52.040> more<00:00:52.250> bass<00:00:52.460> than

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
bring like basically more bass than

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:55.360 
bring like basically more bass than
you'd<00:00:52.820> ever<00:00:52.910> need<00:00:53.210> into<00:00:53.809> each<00:00:53.930> channel<00:00:54.370> but

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
you'd ever need into each channel but

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.100 
you'd ever need into each channel but
the<00:00:55.430> idea<00:00:55.700> is<00:00:55.760> you<00:00:56.360> have<00:00:56.510> a<00:00:56.540> foot<00:00:56.720> switchable

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
the idea is you have a foot switchable

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.260 
the idea is you have a foot switchable
clean<00:00:57.380> boost<00:00:57.680> or<00:00:57.920> distortion<00:00:58.670> on<00:00:58.820> both<00:00:59.000> sides

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
clean boost or distortion on both sides

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.910 
clean boost or distortion on both sides
so<00:00:59.840> you<00:00:59.900> could<00:01:00.050> run<00:01:00.170> it<00:01:00.290> as<00:01:00.380> just<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.710> single

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
so you could run it as just a single

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.500 
so you could run it as just a single
clean<00:01:01.250> boost<00:01:01.490> which<00:01:01.670> is<00:01:01.790> essentially<00:01:02.120> super

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
clean boost which is essentially super

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.299 
clean boost which is essentially super
hard<00:01:02.690> on<00:01:02.810> it's<00:01:03.050> the<00:01:03.140> exact<00:01:03.350> same<00:01:03.380> circuit<00:01:03.950> you

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
hard on it's the exact same circuit you

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.890 
hard on it's the exact same circuit you
can<00:01:04.339> run<00:01:04.580> two<00:01:04.820> super<00:01:05.119> hard-ons<00:01:05.479> in<00:01:05.690> a<00:01:05.750> row

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
can run two super hard-ons in a row

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.260 
can run two super hard-ons in a row
which<00:01:06.110> is<00:01:06.140> the<00:01:06.530> super<00:01:07.070> duper<00:01:07.190> tune<00:01:07.490> one<00:01:07.729> you

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
which is the super duper tune one you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.420 
which is the super duper tune one you
can<00:01:08.420> run<00:01:08.630> a<00:01:08.869> boost<00:01:09.229> and<00:01:09.500> the<00:01:09.710> distortion<00:01:10.250> which

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
can run a boost and the distortion which

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.820 
can run a boost and the distortion which
is<00:01:10.640> the<00:01:10.759> normal<00:01:11.090> box<00:01:11.660> of<00:01:11.869> rack<00:01:12.050> configuration

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:12.830 
is the normal box of rack configuration

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.130 
is the normal box of rack configuration
or<00:01:13.160> you<00:01:13.340> can<00:01:13.490> run<00:01:13.640> two<00:01:13.880> of<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.330> distortions<00:01:14.900> in

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
or you can run two of the distortions in

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.200 
or you can run two of the distortions in
a<00:01:15.290> row<00:01:15.440> which<00:01:15.710> gives<00:01:15.950> you<00:01:16.130> more<00:01:16.580> gain<00:01:16.910> and

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
a row which gives you more gain and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.120 
a row which gives you more gain and
sustain<00:01:17.930> and<00:01:18.259> you<00:01:18.320> probably<00:01:18.500> would<00:01:18.740> ever<00:01:18.890> need

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
sustain and you probably would ever need

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.650 
sustain and you probably would ever need
really<00:01:19.700> really<00:01:19.880> cool<00:01:20.030> for<00:01:20.270> lead<00:01:20.420> tones

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
really really cool for lead tones

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.630 
really really cool for lead tones
supersaturated<00:01:21.560> really<00:01:21.860> compressed<00:01:22.369> tone

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
supersaturated really compressed tone

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880 
supersaturated really compressed tone
but<00:01:23.450> yeah<00:01:23.570> it's<00:01:23.780> like<00:01:23.899> having<00:01:24.140> eight<00:01:24.410> pedals

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
but yeah it's like having eight pedals

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.330 
but yeah it's like having eight pedals
in<00:01:25.040> one<00:01:25.220> really<00:01:26.210> really<00:01:26.420> super<00:01:26.840> cool<00:01:27.340> good

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
in one really really super cool good

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.010 
in one really really super cool good
metal<00:01:28.729> flank<00:01:29.000> paint<00:01:29.270> job<00:01:29.450> has<00:01:29.660> a<00:01:29.720> cool<00:01:29.929> little

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.020 
metal flank paint job has a cool little

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.719 
metal flank paint job has a cool little
painting<00:01:30.410> of<00:01:30.500> J<00:01:30.649> Mascis<00:01:30.860> on<00:01:31.160> it<00:01:31.280> and<00:01:31.429> it's<00:01:31.610> a

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
painting of J Mascis on it and it's a

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.130 
painting of J Mascis on it and it's a
awesome<00:01:32.119> pedal<00:01:32.509> let's<00:01:32.630> see<00:01:32.720> how<00:01:32.780> it<00:01:32.840> sounds

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
awesome pedal let's see how it sounds

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.570 
awesome pedal let's see how it sounds
all<00:01:33.860> right<00:01:33.979> so<00:01:34.100> here's<00:01:34.280> our<00:01:34.369> clean<00:01:34.610> sound

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
all right so here's our clean sound

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.279 
all right so here's our clean sound
here's<00:01:37.580> one<00:01:37.940> boost<00:01:38.210> engage<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:41.780> adds<00:01:41.990> a<00:01:42.140> little

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
here's one boost engage it adds a little

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:43.359 
here's one boost engage it adds a little
bit<00:01:42.410> of<00:01:42.500> dirt<00:01:42.679> a<00:01:42.709> little<00:01:42.950> bit<00:01:43.039> of<00:01:43.100> warmth

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
bit of dirt a little bit of warmth

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:45.040 
bit of dirt a little bit of warmth
here's<00:01:43.580> both<00:01:43.880> boosts<00:01:44.360> going<00:01:44.660> in<00:01:44.720> a<00:01:44.780> row<00:01:44.899> this

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
here's both boosts going in a row this

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.540 
here's both boosts going in a row this
is<00:01:45.200> like<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:45.530> super<00:01:45.890> duper<00:01:45.979> two<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.429> one

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:46.550 
is like the super duper two and one

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.210 
is like the super duper two and one
going<00:01:46.759> on

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.039 

really<00:01:53.729> kind<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> classic<00:01:54.479> rock<00:01:54.630> warm

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
really kind of a classic rock warm

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.450 
really kind of a classic rock warm
overdrive<00:01:55.619> when<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.860> get<00:01:55.950> them<00:01:56.040> both<00:01:56.189> going

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
overdrive when you get them both going

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.109 
overdrive when you get them both going
now<00:01:56.970> here<00:01:57.360> is<00:01:58.220> distortion<00:01:59.220> on<00:01:59.430> one<00:01:59.579> side<00:01:59.820> and

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
now here is distortion on one side and

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
now here is distortion on one side and
the<00:02:00.180> boost<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.780> front<00:02:01.170> so<00:02:01.350> here's<00:02:01.530> just<00:02:01.710> a

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the boost up front so here's just a

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.050 
the boost up front so here's just a
boost<00:02:01.950> by<00:02:02.130> itself<00:02:02.399> again<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:05.549> boost<00:02:05.820> going

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
boost by itself again the boost going

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:14.010 
boost by itself again the boost going
into<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.659> Distortion
