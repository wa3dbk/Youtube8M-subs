00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.030
 two missing stairs on the top left 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.030
 arrived 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.240
 freising 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.340
 only who the green hell and self- worth 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.000
 knows what a fascination of 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.489
 you go out 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.130
 at the beginning of the 90s they still flew the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.170
 heroes of the dtm blind information with 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.670
 over 200 times raced drivers like keke 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:07.460
 rosberg and ellen lohr by the 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.900
 curvy eifel course fear 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.900
 the spar but nordschleife 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.009
 do not think 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.869
 a reason why the dtm 1993 for the last 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:25.030
 times on the Nordschleife has appeared to 

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:28.570
 dangerous with 20 3 82 km long 33 left 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.179
 40 right turns 292 meters 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.799
 height difference by up to 17 percent 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:36.460
 slope is not just her 

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.780
 most demanding no with a total of 140 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.220
 Unfortunately she is dead, too 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.220
 most dangerous race track in the world 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.310
 but before you look at the over 20 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.289
 kilometer long spaghetti course 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:04.140
 green eifel vegetable draws in needs 

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:04.140
 first of all exactly a decent fork 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.500
 however 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.400
 May I introduce lamborghini gallardo 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:25.980
 superleggera and so get it all 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.730
 gallardo superleggera super light and 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.730
 even more power 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.080
 superleggera 530 hp distributed to 1400 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.390
 kilo empty weight probably the shallowest of the 

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.030
 orange with two horns 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.230
 The name La Molina belongs to one connects 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.770
 I would always go with that 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:49.380
 supercar with martial 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.200
 looking body 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.700
 cars 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:56.100
 in the design of a camouflage bomber 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:00.920
 synthesized 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.920
 Super flat super loud and to adjust 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.370
 apa 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:17.240
 So the eco with 100 kilo absolute 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.640
 perfect but ten ps just on it 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:23.770
 um really superleggera here on the 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.770
 I would have 30 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:35.260
 what really super strong here in the 3 since 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:36.820
 really slows down the lining that goes on 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.380
 the slice ran and the thing is in 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.230
 null comma nothing there is a brake pressure 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.640
 there and the nice thing about the brakes is you 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.210
 may also gas again it works 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.210
 forward again 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.239
 All-wheel and supercar is always a 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.870
 difficult topic tends to be one of them 

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:03.220
 shit superleggera on the contrary the car 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.450
 really does not make any of 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.950
 Untersteiner you can in the corner 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.920
 hew as you want 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.230
 he lays on the front axle 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.099
 you can step on the brush and do it 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:13.099
 is just breathtaking 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:19.400
 2 0 was called it 

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.150
 Super cool 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:33.770
 its when the throttle 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.770
 rise up 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:43.990
 the car if you go by car 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:45.910
 you are automatically less Spanish 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.320
 bullfighter but feels like in 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.670
 one of the big pieces betrays 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:51.249
 spain 

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:55.709
 always get used to a giant 

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:55.709
 power without end and the thrill 

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:02.769
 superleggera 100 kilo less for 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:05.259
 190,000 euros 

00:05:02.769 --> 00:05:07.929
 but there are powerful carbon on it 

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:10.089
 the glacier hammering after 38 seconds 

00:05:07.929 --> 00:05:12.789
 the tacho needle over three digit area 

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:17.219
 and only at 315 kilometers per hour goes 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:17.219
 the 5 liter ten cylinder out of breath 

00:05:17.999 --> 00:05:23.019
 the view to the back of the darkness 

00:05:20.709 --> 00:05:26.139
 it can be like a bear's arts 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:36.989
 just be a lamborghini but on the 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:36.989
 nordschleife ball go ahead 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.260
 sms 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:48.760
 the commission 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.760
 makes me think in beauty 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:56.410
 Switzerland is a way to go 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.410
 also really eggs in the pants 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.900
 on the brake 

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.600
 and then left in those very fast 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:02.300
 come 

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:05.670
 but fully pull through 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.560
 Reinhard from the brakes Arenberg 

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:09.139
 and now s 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.180
 roller coaster 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.180
 which raises the interest of children, child-shit 

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.520
 with 230 questions 

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.520
 patrol from there 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.320
 Miegel is already pretty high on 

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:35.070
 habsberg key office long camp 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.070
 goes uphill 

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.600
 to do it 

00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:43.370
 use through the whole stretch 

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:46.660
 now just as I said it works 

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:46.660
 straight ahead and that's all 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:58.260
 second gear hard hard material needs 

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:59.580
 You are already 24 on Saturdays 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.810
 accelerate that goes on the 

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:05.870
 drive shafts when the car goes through 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:07.070
 again nothing accelerating in more detail 

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.370
 stretch knowledgeable 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.090
 count 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:11.090
 place came 

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.510
 I must 

00:07:23.009 --> 00:07:28.139
 drive towards 

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.420
 on the brake 

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:32.780
 and then nice out 

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:33.930
 let go back to the middle left block 

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:37.060
 here 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:37.870
 Concentrate no head calm 

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:39.640
 unimportant 

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:41.120
 Perfect the actual among friends 

00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:43.810
 in swing 

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.810
 on the long 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.670
 posed 

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.670
 also mentally
