00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:09.410
 hello everyone for cooking buns 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:09.410
 books about tasty and healthy food 

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:20.460
 need warm milk flour 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.970
 my friends can be dry or 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.730
 pressed salt sugar and vanilla 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.740
 sugar I have together melted butter 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:42.769
 cream and eggs warm milk 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:46.699
 dissolve we press a few minutes to swell 

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:52.129
 I stood for five minutes now sending 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:56.989
 half he needs kellys gradually 

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.989
 knead the brew 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:18.890
 kneaded and started from the first speed 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.530
 for up to 2 a couple of minutes it turns out 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:32.829
 it seems possible and manually and sinet.com may 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:32.829
 but that was not lumps 

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:46.210
 and cover me with a towel 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:02:04.240
 put away in a warm place dough has risen 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:04.240
 the opara stood 45 minutes rose like 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:15.890
 I put salt vanilla sugar 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.180
 butter 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
 egg 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.490
 it's all mixed up 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:59.109
 I clean the walls 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:59.109
 and now I will sprinkle with poppy seeds 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.760
 but he should always be sprinkled gradually 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:28.219
 do not overdo it 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:28.219
 me but on fuel 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:35.940
 Knead at second speed 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:04.220
 knead the dough should stick 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:22.470
 I left probably 50 grams of flour covering 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:36.990
 again with film and sent on the spot 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:39.830
 the dough radiator went up then personally what 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.830
 falling asleep flour 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:05:00.110
 now make buns about 56 somewhere 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.110
 So 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.250
 I make round buns, I prize the dishes already 

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:14.210
 I prefer it so you can roll them on 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.210
 stage to do 

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:34.800
 I give elimination 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.800
 still swell 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.810
 so I have flour left for 500 bravo 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.450
 gram and probably use 450 but in 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.760
 the recipe, I will point out that 500 to whatever 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:53.040
 flour density 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:56.090
 ready buns already grease 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.090
 cream ghee 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:14.969
 need to let them stand again so that 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:27.110
 rose and stood 10 minutes blurry 

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:27.110
 downed face and carefully grease 

00:06:29.239 --> 00:06:33.809
 it was also possible when mixing the secondary 

00:06:32.459 --> 00:06:37.249
 power raisins 

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:37.249
 then you either buns with raisins 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:52.770
 send already preheated oven 

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.220
 did not try 18 minutes 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:33.780
 cover with a towel after the cops stand 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:40.800
 the buns are cold show the markup 

00:07:46.529 --> 00:07:53.069
 soft 

00:07:48.689 --> 00:07:56.279
 tasty like white sweet bread 

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:59.329
 I liked the recipe buns are ready 

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:59.329
