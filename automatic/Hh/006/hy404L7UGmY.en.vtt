00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.819
 Hey, people, it's good having this 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.130
 video to question who is 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.500
 looking for good 7 network and a good keyboard 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.639
 cost in the case below 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.940
 of 100 reais 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.740
 so I'll explain to you why 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.789
 I concluded the following 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.420
 conclusion 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.760
 in case I searched for trek bite 2 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.480
 what is a keyboard is cute with keys 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.289
 is different with colored and everything 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.560
 more 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.630
 also has the genius of head 255 this is 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.719
 a keyboard that has the old system 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:38.790
 xii right you found for 100 reais 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.579
 also has reservations with the lock by 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.140
 $ 100 and what I'm using logitech 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.570
 here 120 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.140
 what problem the two grounds freight 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.360
 he has a ghost problem is you 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.059
 you try to use two more keys while 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.699
 same time some game or in the system he 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.920
 will not accept and will not recognize 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.890
 then this is the negative point of the freak 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.229
 genius genius from what i heard he is a 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.810
 excellent keyboard it has a system of 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.000
 luxury that 17 keys being that has one 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.549
 problem is the user complaining that he 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.720
 has very high and hard aspects, either 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:17.250
 it's bad for you to be typing 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:19.380
 So for me on a note because you have 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.229
 feel comfortable typing use 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.330
 I deleted the genius also the ratio of 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.880
 book the lock here 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.110
 you find it for 100 reais but it 's a keyboard 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.820
 it is not good 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.740
 I see a lot of people complaining that they do not have 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.079
 bush system né 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.150
 and only worth a little symbol beyond the reserve 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.220
 talk has a keyboard to laugh but it does not 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.460
 quality has no performance and 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.560
 I did not delete it too gamer keyboard 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.360
 So what was the conclusion that I 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.460
 I arrived with the best keyboard you 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.869
 can find under 100 real is in 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.960
 case a keyboard that will not even be the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.659
 is the logitech model kah 120 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.340
 why a soft keyboard is a 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.049
 keyboard here in Brazil you have a guarantee 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.689
 three years and that alone shows the 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.000
 quality of the keyboard and above all a 

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:05.369
 keyboard that does not have ghost 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.350
 practically no keypad I do not 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.270
 I managed to find a defect in this keyboard 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.690
 understood I'll show you now 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.120
 what does it mean 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.450
 the good ghost you see on youtube on 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.220
 google to edit microsoft gols players 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.810

 image will appear taiti uses here is only 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.280

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.350
 any key on your keyboard that will 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.230
 to stay green in case i will hold owe 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.940
 I will hold on to the beauty that happens 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.430
 that the effectiveness when you will play 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:42.040
 a racing game let's design you 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.310
 Hold the key and he will sing 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.800
 tire beauty is holding ws being 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.270
 on common keyboards if you hold ws 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.310
 at the same time and try to tighten the 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.370
 Bikini I 'm asking you now 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.740
 car sing tire and stay spinning on the 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.360
 there to make a tire mark on the 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.980
 floor to floor 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.980
 you will not get an ordinary keyboard 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.540
 already in this nor that of the neno for troicki 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.710
 I'll die where you're going to get it. 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:11.410
 here keyboard is very is to have a performance 

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:13.540
 very insecure about it in you 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.459
 cushing virtually everything in that 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.360
 stated so I did not like it 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:20.590
 then summarizing in the forte fm bocce of 2 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:23.920
 You can not do it, I'll do it. 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.000
 now is to press the ws and the at the same 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.550
 Time she only got ws beauty. 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.520
 This here already makes me clear here. 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.250
 being a great cost-benefit 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:38.680
 else I can select all the 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:42.400
 Here little arrows while the 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.959
 Left to right top to down 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.970
 all in the selected green time too 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.100
 no and still can shake the shift looks 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.830
 for the keys to see the keyboard recognizes 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.019
 at the same time only that is perfect 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.140
 understood is a keyboard that gathers and that is 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.580
 that does not even mention the keyboard distinction 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.830
 understood I could even say that there is a 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:02.260
 style, so many keys, do not even mention it 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.420
 proves good keyboard quality 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.269
 because of this I came to the conclusion that in 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:11.110
 three keyboards force game boy of two 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:14.140
 geniuses head 255 risers the lock and 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:17.090
 logitech at 120 the best is logitech 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:20.419
 because it's cheap 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.010
 It's nice to type is soft for you. 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.430
 typing you can stay testing the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:28.400
 ignore ladies you will not feel 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.010
 pain in the hand is a pain in your hand you 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.889
 It will not have any problem understood. 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:37.220
 Good to play I felt comfortable playing 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.650
 the keys are very soft and off they 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:43.130
 have a three- year warranty on 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.199
 beauty already explained why the 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:49.400
 logitech the 121 best on my point 

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:52.729
 view between all these now headset I 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.530
 I was in doubt about the philips ' model shm 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:56.720
 1900 that many people recommend in 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.350
 internet you can find 45 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:59.960
 real 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:01.610
 then c3 tech doubt this model 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.130
 exsite x 15 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.150
 you find for $ 60 ipo logitech a 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.040
 110 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.210
 Why did I stay with Logitech? 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.000
 hangar 110 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:13.039
 I already deleted face and c3 c3 tech 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.199
 why c3 tech shock appearance 

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:17.539
 pretty much everyone complains 

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:19.220
 quality of the product you buy in 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.490
 a short time is no longer working 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:25.639
 side of life , it breaks down with 

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.000
 I already deleted it and stayed there. 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.229
 in philips and logitech doubt 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.740
 because tec's chosen because the 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:36.050
 government reviewed on the internet of the 277 I saw 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:38.479
 that the logitech headset is much more 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.910
 clean much more niel is the dream too much 

00:05:38.479 --> 00:05:42.830
 sharper than the right not philips 

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:45.860
 that the son is bad movies is very good 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:49.310
 but comparing the microphone of the two 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.289
 Logitech is so much better for me 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.970
 Understanding the sound is much better. 

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:55.760
 so due to this a weight factor 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:58.250
 also and not to mention that it is more 

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.050
 cheap you find for 35 reais 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.270
 if you live in rio de janeiro 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.010
 it may not be a city ​​and buy 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.310
 this value here 35 reais 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:08.570
 another positive point for today's tech two 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.960
 years warranty 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.270
 no 110 or you will buy one 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.639
 headset that will have a warranty 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:18.919
 extended a good two-year warranty 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.450
 of a defect will only send today tech point 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:21.950
 that proves the quality of the product 

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.770
 also because when a product is good 

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:25.760
 they will give you what is a guarantee of 

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.860
 three months 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.599
 beauty and serve break in hand then 

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.040
 taking all this into consideration what 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:32.200
 the indent 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:34.990
 You guys want to play that is surfing the 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:37.240

 for 30 reais on internet sites you 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.580
 should be found at the base of the 45 

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:46.990
 50 more reals on the keyboard is worth it 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.540
 three - year warranty 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.490
 the headset does not have far better technique 

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:54.250
 110 35 reais 

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:56.200

 decide there with the keyboard and headset 

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:16.870
 choosing is a good price, huh? 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.670
 nowadays there are mechanical keyboards 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:21.580
 But you do not want to spend money on 

00:07:18.670 --> 00:07:23.800
