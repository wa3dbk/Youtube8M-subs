00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.970
 Epistle of the Apostle Saint Paul to the 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:10.280
 Romans 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.280
 Romans chapter 11 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:19.080
 so I must ask 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.539
 it is possible that God has rejected his 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.260
 village 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.980
 of course not 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:30.850
 I am also an Israelite descendant of 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:35.550
 abraham and the tribe of benjamin 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:39.520
 there was no god has not rejected his people 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.560
 whom he knew beforehand 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.010
 they do not remember what the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:48.900
 writing about elias when this 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:53.820
 Accused Israel before God 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.400
 Lord they have killed your prophets have 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.720
 knocked down your altars 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.180
 I was left alone and they also want 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.560
 kill me 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.560
 and what was the answer 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.480
 I have reserved seven thousand men who do not 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:16.560
 they have knelt before evil 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:19.530
 the same thing happens now there is a rest 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.430
 chosen by sheer grace 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.000
 and I say by grace 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.740
 and not because they complied otherwise 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.350
 grace would not be grace 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:35.480
 and then what 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.090
 israel did not find what he was looking for 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.910
 but if those chosen ones found it 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.520
 while others hardened says the 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:48.640
 writing 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:52.240
 god those in protection their eyes do not see and 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.400
 his ears do not hear to this day and 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.480
 David says 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.690
 let their banquets be snares and a snare 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:05.550
 a stone where they fall themselves and 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.550
 find your punishment there 

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:11.940
 Make your eyes darken and do not see 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.510
 and that they always walk with their backs 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.510
 hunched 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:21.270
 again I ask 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:25.520
 they stumbled and fell to not return to 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:28.820
 get up in no way 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.360
 as a result of its setback the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:37.650
 salvation has been brought to the pagans 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:41.370
 and this will be a challenge for them 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.830
 if the fall of israel was a wealth 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.770
 for the world 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:51.180
 and what they lost enriched the 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:54.360
 pagan nations how will it be when israel 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:59.060
 reach the fullness 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:04.000
 to you who are not Jews I tell you 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.000
 yes I apostle of the non-Jews 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.870
 I put so much effort into fulfilling my 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.470
 job 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:18.750
 it's because I want to awaken the jealousy of 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.260
 my race and so save some of them 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:26.960
 if its exclusion has been reconciliation 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:29.290
 of the world with god that will mean his 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.780
 reinstatement 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.989
 but life resurfaces from among 

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.989
 dead 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:40.890
 when the first fruits are consecrated to God 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:44.760
 everything is blessed 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.200
 If the root is holy, so will the 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.599
 branches 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.019
 is that some branches have been 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.510
 cut while you were taken from 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:58.590
 a wild olive to graft tea on 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:04.300
 the good tree of them benefiting you 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:08.440
 so of the root and the sap of the olive tree 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:13.600
 do not despise those branches 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:16.850
 How can you feel superior? It's not you 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:20.510
 the one who holds the root 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.720
 but it is the root that holds you up 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.820
 you 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.720
 will you say maybe 

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:32.000
 cut the branches to graft miami 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.820
 very well they did not believe and they were broken 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.030
 while you are there thanks to the 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.060
 faith 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.770
 but do not be proud and watch your 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.860
 Steps 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:49.750
 because if God did not forgive the branches 

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:54.580
 less natural will still forgive you 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:56.160
 notice that God is at once kind and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.030
 severe 

00:04:56.160 --> 00:05:01.420
 severe with them who fell and kindly 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.140
 with you 

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:09.560
 as long as persevere are the good then 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:12.060
 otherwise you too will be cut 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:15.360
 as for them 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:19.439
 if they do not persist in rejecting the faith 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.249
 they will be grafted in because God is capable of 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:25.099
 graft the again 

00:05:22.249 --> 00:05:28.999
 if you were taken out of the wild olive tree 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:32.599
 that was your same species to be 

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:36.139
 grafted into the good olive tree that was not 

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:39.109
 of your kind will be much easier for 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:41.499
 they who are of the same species 

00:05:39.109 --> 00:05:41.499
 olive 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:46.090
 I want brothers who understand this 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.300
 mystery 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:52.389
 and do not feel superior 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.349
 a part of israel- will stay 

00:05:52.389 --> 00:05:55.349
 hardened 

00:05:55.969 --> 00:06:00.730
 until the set of nations 

00:05:58.009 --> 00:06:04.940
 I have entered 

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:06.860
 then all Israel will be saved according to 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.530
 says the writing 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:12.050
 decio a will leave the liberator that 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:13.800
 will clean Jacob's children of all 

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:16.560
 its faults 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.720
 and this is the alliance that I will make with 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.930
 them after erasing all their 

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.930
 sins 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.449
 if we look at them from the gospel they 

00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:30.500
 they are enemies 

00:06:26.449 --> 00:06:34.490
 what is for the good of you 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:38.270
 but following the choice they are 

00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:41.240
 loved in attention to their parents because 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:45.680
 God does not repent of his call nor 

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:48.530
 of your gifts, well, you who do not 

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:52.110
 they obeyed God they were forgiven to 

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:54.990
 through the disobedience of the Jews 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:58.920
 they in turn will be forgiven after 

00:06:54.990 --> 00:07:01.780
 of the current disobedience that has 

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:04.450
 brought forgiveness to you 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:07.630
 so God made everyone go through the 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.780
 disobedience in order to show everyone 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.590
 his mercy 

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:17.730
 How deep wisdom is rich 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:22.009
 and the science of God as to inquire 

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:25.339
 decisions or recognize their ways 

00:07:22.009 --> 00:07:27.520
 who never entered into the thoughts 

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:29.560
 of the lord 

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:31.350
 whom he called to be his 

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.380
 adviser 

00:07:31.350 --> 00:07:36.880
 who gave him first for God to have 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:40.110
 to return it 

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:40.110
 everything comes from him 

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:47.689
 for the event and will return to him to be 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:50.499
 the glory forever 

00:07:47.689 --> 00:07:50.499
 Amen
