00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 hello friends and welcome to 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:06.810
 another video on my channel 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.330
 in the year 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.099
 today it's about a mod there have 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.870
 I discovered something or rather 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:19.080
 said a friend told me 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:22.050
 I personally find it very funny there 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.830
 or you can if you have the model then 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.800
 you can bring a black hole 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.330
 let arise 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.700
 For example, here I would have been 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:46.469
 a radio that is nothing now 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:49.910
 special but it makes music like that 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.910
 bad that there now run only once 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.640
 Because of me, I'm sitting here now 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:07.110
 portal you know the game totally and 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.500
 it is simple then you have it 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.570
 Advantage that with a second portal of 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.770
 are white when you go into a purely 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:24.330
 If you can do it, then you come with the other one 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.150
 back out when we go in you come 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.670
 here again if you somehow times 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.560
 run far away or so then you can 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.009
 to see it 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:38.850
 there you were before tal and or fitness man 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:41.100
 other portal there is always quite good 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.049
 if somehow you just watched something 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.320
 or so that you are the portals 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.700
 again, because if I am now 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.700
 example the portal 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.600
 and then when you click on it you press it 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.140
 portal inputs 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.090
 I'll just do that now 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.910
 are my portal right you can still see 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:10.000
 nice around a thread around a reticule 

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:14.140
 Once upon a time there is something blue and one 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.020
 orange so blue it on one 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:22.050
 portal if I said that when 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:22.050
 now mine against young as always 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.690
 there you see that it is too far or there 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.020
 nothing in the field of flowers 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.150
 there's nothing that's why I 'm here 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:41.709
 is, it is identified by total 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.410
 finished and wanted to come back now 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:47.020
 because you the point me is me completely 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:49.270
 you just can not do it because of it 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.510
 I would suggest either two 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:58.000
 portal with or takes your own 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:59.650
 and then not so much playing around you 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.780
 can also do it for me if I am 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:07.180
 Now every time that one has simply 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.930
 I want to go away because of me 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.390
 spread out on it 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.730
 therefore do not always put then you have 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:22.959
 the portal always with you one could 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.100
 but here again never gone 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:28.630
 though struck in her 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.760
 and back there is so come away now 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.560
 we show what the actual topic is 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.760
 wanted 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.890
 then I have to briefly here once 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:41.160
 nice place find here a portal 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.160
 purely 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.480
 I'm back is mine minecraft 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.480
 just smeared 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:54.900
 on the subject for this I would have to be a man 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:04:01.090
 to be done 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:04.360
 or comes as I said here it is 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.430
 a portal now you have the moon 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.430
 search or you are the moon send 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:22.560
 I 'm smart to have a good position 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:29.889
 there you see the portal with my wife 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 then quite a few shots around the moon 

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:33.280
 hold true 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:38.770
 Now you can see that I have 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:41.650
 hit and what does a black one come up with? 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:48.400
 hole all yes environment to i 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:50.740
 Think 15 or 20 bridges feed animals 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.860
 and creatures are also fed 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:57.630
 as well as I renounce that now 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:05.770
 same items if we also doubted 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:07.090
 are also drawn in and yes so 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.700
 it arises then 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:14.110
 then I could upgrade here again 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:20.139
 and others away what I personally build 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:21.880
 use if I always the same 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.840
 is now listed that means I have 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:27.340
 you hit moon he is on the moon 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:28.990
 as I said so you could very nice 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:33.280
 smooth surfaces make that I do 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:37.800
 sometimes the tree is pulled to all dirt 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.850
 since I do now got a great 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.850
 smooth platform of 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.260
 I think that's really funny with me 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.780
 sometimes I can not stand a chance 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.670
 then little chance of break-in 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:58.040
 you have to I'm sorry I have to 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.090
 do not know if it is with you too 

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.560
 not so personally i do not have any 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.890
 times such a bad calculator I know 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:14.300
 not if that's kind of a bug no 

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:16.100
 and jan bornemann party becomes 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.410
 but always there or became element 

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.590
 also just pulled in 

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:28.600
 so he can all over here again 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:28.600
 still won by 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:37.880
 but the money comeback so the mod is 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:40.640
 very funny and so yes it tasted 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:43.340
 you can simply serve him 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:45.010
 either so amazing or you use 

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.890
 best that is always the best 

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:52.760
 possibility used crafting terminal 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:53.630
 that's a launcher of minecraft there 

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.030
 you have then 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:59.770
 I believe all versions on it all up 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:07:02.780
 now except maybe a two and one 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:05.260
 the associated with which place for 

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:08.060
 this version was outside 

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:10.460
 Just get them some times I've got that 

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.169
 link in the description very useful 

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.100
 I personally play mainly 

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:15.740
 about that 

00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:19.720
 You have then whether the fine you can do that 

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:22.729
 do not cut shader or cut it 

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.669
 since the new version then runs the culprit 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:26.810
 not perfect it is still 

00:07:25.669 --> 00:07:29.600
 not so broken 

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:31.490
 So that is broken in my running 

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.760
 shader not at all with my friends 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:39.979
 It does not work either but you can 

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:45.729
 the friends with indicator that exist 

00:07:39.979 --> 00:07:45.729
 still stuck mods and gigants 

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.379
 yes, here I can again 

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:54.379
 demonstrating would also be involved 

00:07:51.379 --> 00:07:56.870
 and now totally and completely live in the 

00:07:54.379 --> 00:07:59.449
 I would die and yes 

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:03.219
 Thank you for watching please go there 

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:08.050
 an abo da please also a thumbs up 

00:08:03.219 --> 00:08:08.050
 and yes we'll see you next time
