got<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.510> one<00:03:16.280> disconnected<00:03:17.420> this<00:03:18.420> is<00:03:18.510> where

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
got that one disconnected this is where

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:20.120 
got that one disconnected this is where
it<00:03:18.720> comes<00:03:18.930> in<00:03:19.200> handy<00:03:19.350> to<00:03:19.530> have<00:03:19.680> a<00:03:19.740> little<00:03:19.980> bit

it comes in handy to have a little bit

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.930 
it comes in handy to have a little bit
longer<00:03:20.340> figured<00:03:20.760> out<00:03:22.220> alright<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.280> we'll<00:03:23.730> just

longer figured out alright so we'll just

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:29.770 
longer figured out alright so we'll just
do<00:03:24.090> the<00:03:24.210> same<00:03:24.270> thing<00:03:24.720> here

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.660 

there<00:03:30.170> we<00:03:30.320> go<00:03:30.470> we're<00:03:30.680> disconnected<00:03:31.310> there<00:03:31.490> we

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
there we go we're disconnected there we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.670 
there we go we're disconnected there we
have<00:03:31.880> our<00:03:31.960> antenna<00:03:35.110> right<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.380> we're<00:03:36.530> going

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
have our antenna right and we're going

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.400 
have our antenna right and we're going
to<00:03:36.710> just<00:03:36.890> take<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:38.020> new<00:03:39.020> one<00:03:40.570> which<00:03:41.570> is<00:03:41.870> right

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:42.410 
to just take the new one which is right

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.180 
to just take the new one which is right
here<00:03:42.440> and<00:03:42.920> we're<00:03:43.760> going<00:03:43.880> to<00:03:43.910> connect<00:03:44.210> it<00:03:45.190> on

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
here and we're going to connect it on

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.920 
here and we're going to connect it on
the<00:03:46.340> outside<00:03:46.670> port<00:03:46.970> see<00:03:47.120> this<00:03:47.240> one<00:03:47.360> has<00:03:47.450> three

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
the outside port see this one has three

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.980 
the outside port see this one has three
so<00:03:48.350> we're<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.070> to<00:03:49.160> have<00:03:49.340> two<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:50.810> not<00:03:50.959> a

big deal at all we'll just go ahead and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:26.129 
big deal at all we'll just go ahead and
connect<00:03:54.320> these<00:03:54.470> right<00:03:54.860> here

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.839 

let's<00:04:26.680> make<00:04:26.860> sure<00:04:27.039> they're<00:04:27.189> nice<00:04:27.460> and<00:04:27.520> secure

00:04:27.839 --> 00:04:27.849 
let's make sure they're nice and secure

let's make sure they're nice and secure
on<00:04:28.120> there<00:04:28.419> you<00:04:28.539> don't<00:04:28.569> fall<00:04:29.050> off<00:04:29.189> so<00:04:30.189> you're

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
on there you don't fall off so you're

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:31.619 
on there you don't fall off so you're
going<00:04:30.430> to<00:04:30.460> have<00:04:30.550> to<00:04:30.639> open<00:04:30.729> this<00:04:30.969> thing<00:04:31.030> back<00:04:31.389> up

00:04:31.619 --> 00:04:31.629 
going to have to open this thing back up
