sick bastard designed this stuff but
besides<00:02:40.670> the<00:02:40.909> added<00:02:41.209> challenge<00:02:41.659> there<00:02:41.870> were<00:02:41.959> a

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
besides the added challenge there were a

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.839 
besides the added challenge there were a
few<00:02:42.260> other<00:02:42.409> interesting<00:02:43.010> things<00:02:43.280> introduced

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
few other interesting things introduced

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.149 
few other interesting things introduced
most<00:02:44.450> notably<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.139> choice<00:02:45.379> of<00:02:45.650> plane<00:02:45.889> as

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
most notably the choice of plane as

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:48.490 
most notably the choice of plane as
Mario<00:02:46.579> or<00:02:46.879> Luigi<00:02:46.909> each<00:02:47.870> was<00:02:48.200> slightly

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
Mario or Luigi each was slightly

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.979 
Mario or Luigi each was slightly
different<00:02:48.769> controls<00:02:49.400> Mario<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.299> the<00:02:50.599> same<00:02:50.840> as

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
different controls Mario is the same as

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.140 
different controls Mario is the same as
before<00:02:51.109> but<00:02:51.829> his<00:02:51.919> brother<00:02:52.220> can<00:02:52.519> jump<00:02:52.819> slightly

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
before but his brother can jump slightly

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.629 
before but his brother can jump slightly
higher<00:02:53.540> and<00:02:53.840> he<00:02:54.409> slides<00:02:54.769> around<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:55.310> bit<00:02:55.489> more

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
higher and he slides around a bit more

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.909 
higher and he slides around a bit more
on<00:02:55.790> the<00:02:55.849> ground<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:56.480> for<00:02:57.200> some<00:02:57.379> reason<00:02:57.769> the

00:02:57.909 --> 00:02:57.919 
on the ground and for some reason the

00:02:57.919 --> 00:02:59.619 
on the ground and for some reason the
two-player<00:02:58.310> mode<00:02:58.340> was<00:02:58.790> removed<00:02:59.180> because<00:02:59.419> of

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
two-player mode was removed because of

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.899 
two-player mode was removed because of
this<00:02:59.870> feature<00:03:00.079> but<00:03:00.859> this<00:03:01.099> definitely<00:03:01.489> adds<00:03:01.760> a

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
this feature but this definitely adds a

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.759 
this feature but this definitely adds a
bit<00:03:02.060> of<00:03:02.090> replayability<00:03:02.569> if<00:03:03.230> you're<00:03:03.409> badass

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
bit of replayability if you're badass
