00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello girls so I find you 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.140
 today in a new video so 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.790
 it will be a tutorial video to make you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.160
 the tutorial ji carnival masks 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.889
 so this video actually will contain two 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.360
 tutorial so a tutorial juice masks the 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:15.809
 carnival that you could see in the 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.710
 video 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.820
 all our movie creations is another 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.949
 carnival mask 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.250
 in fact I found an image on google 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.019
 and I was inspired by it so I 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.279
 realized a new type if I can say 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.380
 carnival masks 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.469
 but unfortunately I have already sold and 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.489
 I had made a copy so 

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.190
 here I am sorry but I will make you 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.110
 still the tutorial then for that you 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 will need some bread from your 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:46.079
 choice so I will always use 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.750
 the number 63 plums in soft of Indochina 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.129
 tools of a toothpick finally a body 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.410
 in skewers it's 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.780
 this is optional if you 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.170
 want to make a hole if I can say 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.550
 in your creation of a not cut so 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.250
 I advise you to use a 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.619
 cut straw an important pieces have 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.380
 so here it is after you see it 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.680
 a road to the scalpel end of an object 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.590
 cutting without teeth of a roll but 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:15.090
 it's evacuating the numbers here and from 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.930
 hopping pythons where you go 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.640
 maybe not if you wish 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.700
 hang your creation 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.860
 so stop everything starts and you go 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.840
 so take a piece of your dough for 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.150
 the first tutorial 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.790
 so it's true that he 's image 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.890
 which I inspired myself 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.670
 you will separate your dough in two 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:39.079
 equal parts 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.079
 sorry and so you formed balls 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.189
 then you will flatten them so either 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:53.869
 with your finger but in this case you 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.429
 have been forced to clean up your 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:00.770
 creation to remove the trace of law 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:02:03.609
 or so I'll have your roll 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.170
 attack my first ball 

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:09.440
 so I apathy not too hungry but not 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.069
 too thick either finally must it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.819
 still really round you do not 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:18.230
 achieve it restructure the edges here 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.540
 so here I have pretty much what I want 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.310
 I come to do my second small 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.019
 mug 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.930
 so gerard trained because he can not 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:28.930
 laugh a lot less well 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.590
 so see it's still small 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:35.480
 light shots a game but not great 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.790
 rolls so I have my two 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 little balls 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.579
 there we will come the players so this is where 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:45.980
 that such intervenes our 100 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:49.569
 hens so I'll come take a little 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.569
 of dough there and come join them 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:59.900
 so on both sides I do it after 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.549
 if you want to do it only 

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:03.549
 on one side it is also possible 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:12.819
 so I'm you have take your from 

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:18.709
 chint rolls and we're just going 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:22.359
 drawn a species of rounds that 's 

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.359
 so that its shape makes a hollow 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:41.380
 where I deform and that's what it gives 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.400
 for now and then you picked up a 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:48.310
 little bit of your dough where you find 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.490
 also take a paw others from a 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.120
 other color and you can make a 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:58.830
 little bit of a g8 is recognizable a little 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.830
 boudin that you're just going 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:12.280
 cut off from Madame cut you will be able 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.980
 come make some kind of dice 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.350
 are so I can say about your creation 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:26.560
 for example here I am coming 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:28.710
 Wrapped in water and I come to place it 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.660
 between 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.980
 so that's after you can change from 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.520
 color so I do not really like it 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.600
 tutorial finally this type of mass that there is 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.770
 for that I'm going to show you a 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:41.380
 second method 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.500
 so yes I took the same paw I 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.550
 I'm sorry so you're going to take 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.400
 your dough and flatten it so there is no need 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:56.530
 the farm were too much too thin but 

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:59.110
 not ipe at all then the help 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.700
 of a boss I do not have to take a 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.130
 you can also use a 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.640
 cookie cutter rectangle but not the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:09.690
 no more you have come 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.690
 cut out a rectangle 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.010
 so for now it does not look like 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.780
 all a carnival mask 

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:28.169
 I confirm it you will come 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:34.949
 cut the rounded edges finally 

00:05:28.169 --> 00:05:37.500
 only two rounded edges so 

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:43.889
 you have two rounded edges that go 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:45.770
 to be at the top and edge lying on the 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:48.479
 two rounded edges 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:51.830
 you're going to come up with a kind of 

00:05:48.479 --> 00:05:51.830
 little triangle 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.979
 That's what happens 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:07.650
 you can also fit and a 

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:12.840
 miniscule compared to each other at the top of 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.979
 your mask and this is the part the 

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:17.940
 more important because he'll have to 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:20.550
 come in actually give shape to the mask 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:25.470
 so that's me I'm rounding up before 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:28.550
 all the edges so I'm going to extended him 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:30.930
 actually the eyes if I can say 

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.410
 so for fingerprints it's not 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:33.330
 serious 

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:38.450
 hop we move the finger before 

00:06:33.330 --> 00:06:38.450
 cooking etc neither seen nor known 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:45.889
 this is how will the bottom and the top of 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.750
 my mask 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:51.930
 so after we did not do it 

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.349
 like that I did it more - but good 

00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:56.039
 here 

00:06:52.349 --> 00:06:58.260
 press each one as he wants so 

00:06:56.039 --> 00:07:00.479
 I pass my little finger 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:04.160
 so you see that I'm committing them here 

00:07:00.479 --> 00:07:06.990
 are really hungry my tech mask 

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:10.650
 so I will be more likely to make a 

00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:12.430
 little hole here for example with my 

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:14.470
 small peak 

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:18.580
 and of course what's missing is the 

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:24.660
 eyes so I take my straw with play 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:29.590
 cut me off with madame I take off the little 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:32.790
 the day before the little hey hey I redo the 

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:32.790
 same thing on the other side 

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:40.780
 so I try to be pretty much 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:44.950
 symmetrical all the same good me it's going 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.910
 it's pretty much symmetrical and so you 

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:48.370
 can cook it 

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:50.860
 after cooking you can add some 

00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:53.500
 small feathers on the backs of small 

00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:56.200
 glitter what you want 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.170
 so here are the girls I hope this 

00:07:56.200 --> 00:08:00.820
 you will have liked 

00:07:58.170 --> 00:08:04.210
 do not hesitate to ask for other tutorials 

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:05.230
 video reviews and then I make you 

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:08.010
 big kisses 

00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.010
 like
