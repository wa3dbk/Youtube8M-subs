factoring why stellar chose this

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.590 
factoring why stellar chose this
particular<00:00:07.310> product<00:00:07.700> it's<00:00:08.210> because<00:00:08.480> the

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:08.600 
particular product it's because the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.940 
particular product it's because the

design they needed something that was

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:14.830 
design they needed something that was
going<00:00:13.700> to<00:00:13.790> be<00:00:13.880> fairly<00:00:14.060> simple<00:00:14.360> for<00:00:14.600> them<00:00:14.720> to

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:14.840 
going to be fairly simple for them to

process keeping in mind that they had a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.400 
process keeping in mind that they had a
nine-month<00:00:31.699> build<00:00:31.940> time<00:00:32.180> I<00:00:32.480> don't<00:00:33.230> have

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:33.410 
nine-month build time I don't have

nine-month build time I don't have
delivery<00:00:34.039> sometimes<00:00:34.219> and<00:00:34.730> obviously<00:00:35.270> I've

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
delivery sometimes and obviously I've

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.970 
delivery sometimes and obviously I've
got<00:00:35.570> a<00:00:35.600> heap<00:00:36.050> of<00:00:36.079> guys<00:00:36.350> doing<00:00:36.710> around

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
got a heap of guys doing around

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.460 
got a heap of guys doing around
scratching<00:00:37.579> a<00:00:37.790> look<00:00:37.940> of<00:00:38.060> stuff<00:00:38.360> to<00:00:38.480> do<00:00:38.630> so<00:00:38.660> we

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
scratching a look of stuff to do so we

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.770 
scratching a look of stuff to do so we
key<00:00:39.860> everything<00:00:40.340> into<00:00:40.880> an<00:00:41.510> effective

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:41.780 
key everything into an effective

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.770 
key everything into an effective
timeline<00:00:42.440> it's<00:00:43.160> imperative<00:00:43.550> that<00:00:43.700> these<00:00:44.510> guys

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
timeline it's imperative that these guys

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.810 
timeline it's imperative that these guys
have<00:00:45.290> the<00:00:45.380> material<00:00:45.800> on<00:00:45.980> site<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.370> same<00:00:46.579> day

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
have the material on site the same day

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.330 
have the material on site the same day
because<00:00:47.780> I<00:00:47.840> gotta<00:00:47.960> keep<00:00:48.079> the<00:00:48.200> job<00:00:48.380> going<00:00:48.710> but<00:00:49.219> I

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:49.340 
because I gotta keep the job going but I

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.500 
because I gotta keep the job going but I
can<00:00:49.430> probably<00:00:49.550> guarantee<00:00:49.820> there's<00:00:50.270> no<00:00:50.300> other

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
can probably guarantee there's no other

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
timber suppliers in Victoria that can

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:53.650 
timber suppliers in Victoria that can
actually<00:00:52.399> deliver<00:00:52.610> what<00:00:53.059> they<00:00:53.210> need<00:00:53.450> on<00:00:53.570> the

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:56.690 
same day so with this particular part I

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:59.470 
same day so with this particular part I
gave<00:00:57.410> them<00:00:57.620> that<00:00:57.770> that<00:00:58.460> ability<00:00:58.670> to<00:00:58.910> get<00:00:59.300> the

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
gave them that that ability to get the
