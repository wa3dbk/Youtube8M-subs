one of my favorite games that I've been

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:17.090 
one of my favorite games that I've been
playing<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.770> called

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
playing it's called

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.099 
playing it's called
two<00:00:17.340> dots<00:00:17.609> so<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.270> do<00:00:18.449> it's<00:00:18.570> pretty<00:00:18.779> simple<00:00:19.050> you

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
two dots so we do it's pretty simple you

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.810 
two dots so we do it's pretty simple you
basically<00:00:19.439> just<00:00:19.560> connect<00:00:19.980> dots<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.520> you<00:00:20.640> can

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
basically just connect dots but you can

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.759 
basically just connect dots but you can
start<00:00:21.119> out<00:00:21.420> start<00:00:21.689> with<00:00:21.779> the<00:00:21.869> boost<00:00:22.080> because<00:00:22.470> I

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
start out start with the boost because I

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.529 
start out start with the boost because I
probably<00:00:23.369> need<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:23.880> it'll<00:00:24.090> give<00:00:24.210> you<00:00:24.330> random

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
probably need it it'll give you random

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.240 
probably need it it'll give you random
things<00:00:24.930> like<00:00:25.109> this<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.529> it'll<00:00:25.710> take<00:00:25.890> out<00:00:26.039> some

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
things like this and it'll take out some

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.980 
things like this and it'll take out some
of<00:00:26.310> the<00:00:26.369> dots<00:00:26.550> so<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.240> took<00:00:27.359> out<00:00:27.510> half<00:00:27.660> um<00:00:27.869> so

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
of the dots so it took out half um so

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.410 
of the dots so it took out half um so
for<00:00:28.109> this<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.470> I<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> crack<00:00:29.070> these

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420 
for this one I have to crack these

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.150 
for this one I have to crack these
icicles<00:00:30.420> or<00:00:30.750> whatever<00:00:31.019> they're<00:00:31.260> stuck<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:31.800> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
icicles or whatever they're stuck in so

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.650 
icicles or whatever they're stuck in so
you<00:00:32.219> basically<00:00:32.399> just<00:00:32.790> connect<00:00:33.059> the<00:00:33.180> dots<00:00:33.210> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
you basically just connect the dots and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.229 
you basically just connect the dots and
try<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.110> break<00:00:34.530> them<00:00:34.980> out<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> thing<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
try to break them out of the thing you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.479 
try to break them out of the thing you
can<00:00:36.390> also<00:00:36.540> do<00:00:36.840> like<00:00:36.870> different<00:00:37.260> combos<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.219> say

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
can also do like different combos so say

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.430 
can also do like different combos so say
I<00:00:38.520> had<00:00:38.760> a<00:00:38.790> slope<00:00:39.210> maybe<00:00:39.600> I'll<00:00:39.750> get<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.899> square<00:00:40.200> it

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I had a slope maybe I'll get a square it

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.500 
I had a slope maybe I'll get a square it
would<00:00:40.590> get<00:00:40.739> rid<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:40.980> all<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:41.550> colors

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
would get rid of all of the colors

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.479 
would get rid of all of the colors
ohhere<00:00:42.840> square<00:00:43.200> so<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:43.829> got<00:00:43.950> rid<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.190> all<00:00:44.340> the

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
ohhere square so it got rid of all the

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.340 
ohhere square so it got rid of all the
blue<00:00:44.670> ones<00:00:44.850> so<00:00:45.149> it's<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.420> fun<00:00:45.629> and<00:00:45.899> quite

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
blue ones so it's pretty fun and quite

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.779 
blue ones so it's pretty fun and quite
addicting<00:00:46.770> once<00:00:46.950> you<00:00:47.129> actually<00:00:47.489> get<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.700> hang

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
addicting once you actually get the hang

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.160 
addicting once you actually get the hang
of<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> I<00:00:48.239> started<00:00:48.629> playing<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.930> I<00:00:48.989> was<00:00:49.079> like

point

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.030 
point
that's<00:04:28.210> jelly<00:04:28.570> jump<00:04:28.840> let's<00:04:29.080> move<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.470> to<00:04:29.620> shade

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:30.040 
that's jelly jump let's move on to shade

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:31.980 
that's jelly jump let's move on to shade
you<00:04:30.580> basically<00:04:31.030> it's<00:04:31.180> kind<00:04:31.360> of<00:04:31.510> like<00:04:31.600> a<00:04:31.720> weird

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
you basically it's kind of like a weird

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.290 
you basically it's kind of like a weird
Tetris<00:04:32.680> you<00:04:32.920> want<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.280> look<00:04:33.430> line<00:04:33.700> up<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.060> line

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
Tetris you want to look line up the line

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.660 
Tetris you want to look line up the line
so<00:04:34.570> that's<00:04:34.780> all<00:04:34.960> match<00:04:35.620> colors<00:04:36.040> and<00:04:36.220> disappear

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:36.670 
so that's all match colors and disappear

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:38.940 
so that's all match colors and disappear
but<00:04:36.910> you<00:04:37.360> make<00:04:37.600> different<00:04:38.050> shades<00:04:38.380> so<00:04:38.800> that

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:38.950 
but you make different shades so that

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:41.220 
but you make different shades so that
the<00:04:39.040> colors<00:04:39.340> will<00:04:39.490> match<00:04:39.670> so<00:04:40.570> we<00:04:40.960> want<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.140> put

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:41.230 
the colors will match so we want to put

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.410 
the colors will match so we want to put
that<00:04:41.410> one<00:04:41.560> there<00:04:41.830> and<00:04:42.040> then<00:04:42.490> it<00:04:42.700> disappears<00:04:43.150> it

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:43.420 
that one there and then it disappears it

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.940 
that one there and then it disappears it
gets<00:04:43.600> really<00:04:43.810> hard<00:04:44.020> because<00:04:44.200> it<00:04:44.350> goes<00:04:44.470> really

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:44.950 
gets really hard because it goes really

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.640 
gets really hard because it goes really
fast<00:04:45.070> and<00:04:45.580> you<00:04:46.090> have<00:04:46.330> to<00:04:46.480> make<00:04:46.690> like<00:04:47.020> a<00:04:47.170> million

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:50.250 
fast and you have to make like a million
different<00:04:47.980> colors<00:04:48.400> for<00:04:49.270> it<00:04:49.360> to<00:04:49.480> go<00:04:49.660> like<00:04:49.990> this

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
different colors for it to go like this

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:51.690 
different colors for it to go like this
like<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:50.650> we'll<00:04:50.770> have<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:50.980> make<00:04:51.130> this<00:04:51.250> green
