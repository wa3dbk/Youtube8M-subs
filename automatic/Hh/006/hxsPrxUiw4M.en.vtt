 dangerous virus that transform people 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.300
 thirsting for bread and circuses monsters gangster 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.760
 anarchists conspiracy government 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.590

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.039
 Previously, he has been a wonderful and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.160
 now zombie-like concentration 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.210
 personalities crossed all boundaries 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.670
 government having learned about this issue 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.399
 hurried over and carried the city of concrete 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.769
 the walled walls of this city are survivors 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.550
 there is only one to unite in 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.710
 the fight 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:07.170
 but not everything is so easy besides 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.450
 remote communities and surviving singles 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.820
 the hardest to have good 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.920
 guys parkour people living in one of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.229
 skyscraper and there are bad guys under 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.659
 led by raisa who prefer 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.360
 first shoot and then talk 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:23.460
 speak body knows what's against contagion 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.710
 transmitted by a zombie bite is available 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.840
 antidotes so-called anti zen 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 which with regular admission allows 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.579
 delay a terrible painful death in 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.409
 the city does not naturally produce it but 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.899
 good-natured uncle fat cats with 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.270
 pleasure dropping planes whole 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.700
 containers filled and miraculous 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:43.740
 the elixir doesn't sound so bad 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:45.810
 you can live and survive but it is only when 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.880
 the light of the day is the sun going down behind 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.950
 horizon and kyle gets into a pullback without 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.290
 flashlight is not visible beyond their own hands 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.540
 But to turn it on somehow is reluctant because the light 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.030
 instantly attract the attention of dozens 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.729
 hungry eyes and walking at night 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.829
 become the most real running 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.320
 I'm not talking about particularly dangerous 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.719
 creatures that go hunting 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.340
 only at night and only 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:10.899
 acrobatic skills and remarkable strength 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.629
 will be able to save the main character from 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:16.480
 and hiring doom bringing all the facts together 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:19.680
 we have by daylight with an average plot 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.510
 a huge amount of invigorating spirit of action 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.519
 smartest parkour in 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.560
 a dozen variations of improved weapons 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.099
 interesting battle vs live system 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:32.200
