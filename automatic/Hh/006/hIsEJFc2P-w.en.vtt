controller knows that the joysticks are

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.290 
controller knows that the joysticks are
smaller<00:01:15.110> so<00:01:15.710> the<00:01:15.860> FPS<00:01:16.220> freak<00:01:16.430> from<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.790> 360

room<00:01:56.150> and<00:01:56.360> the<00:01:56.480> same<00:01:56.659> thing<00:01:56.840> with<00:01:56.930> the<00:01:57.020> sniper

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
room and the same thing with the sniper

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.280 
room and the same thing with the sniper
the<00:01:58.100> sniper<00:01:58.370> is<00:01:58.520> like<00:01:58.970> the<00:01:59.120> older<00:01:59.870> version

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
the sniper is like the older version

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.090 
the sniper is like the older version
gives<00:02:00.980> you<00:02:01.130> that<00:02:01.340> same<00:02:01.580> range<00:02:02.860> going<00:02:03.860> to<00:02:03.950> show

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
gives you that same range going to show

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.710 
gives you that same range going to show
you<00:02:04.190> here<00:02:04.520> if<00:02:04.700> you<00:02:04.880> come<00:02:05.090> in<00:02:05.210> close<00:02:05.300> you<00:02:05.630> can

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
you here if you come in close you can

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.750 
you here if you come in close you can
see<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.960> back<00:02:06.140> of<00:02:06.170> these<00:02:06.409> they<00:02:07.070> just<00:02:07.100> click<00:02:07.550> on

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
see the back of these they just click on

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.809 
see the back of these they just click on
and<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.330> they<00:02:08.450> got<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:08.659> be<00:02:08.720> a<00:02:08.750> good<00:02:08.959> size<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:10.159> me

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
and so they got to be a good size for me

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.309 
and so they got to be a good size for me
personally<00:02:11.209> I<00:02:11.239> am<00:02:11.450> NOT<00:02:11.480> had<00:02:11.750> any<00:02:11.959> issues

personally I am NOT had any issues

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.009 
personally I am NOT had any issues
taking<00:02:12.560> them<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.800> and<00:02:13.010> off<00:02:13.099> before<00:02:13.690> they<00:02:14.690> may

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:15.019 
taking them on and off before they may

taking them on and off before they may
Campbell<00:02:16.010> pointed<00:02:16.340> out<00:02:16.459> a<00:02:16.489> really<00:02:16.969> good<00:02:17.120> fact

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:17.329 
Campbell pointed out a really good fact

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.050 
Campbell pointed out a really good fact
is<00:02:17.540> if<00:02:18.049> you<00:02:18.319> look<00:02:18.530> coming<00:02:18.889> close<00:02:19.159> here<00:02:19.459> if<00:02:19.909> you

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
is if you look coming close here if you

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.920 
is if you look coming close here if you
look<00:02:20.209> at<00:02:20.359> the<00:02:20.450> material

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
look at the material

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.770 
look at the material
on<00:02:20.989> the<00:02:21.109> Xbox<00:02:21.530> one<00:02:21.799> joystick<00:02:22.510> we're<00:02:23.510> kind<00:02:23.719> of

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
on the Xbox one joystick we're kind of

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.330 
on the Xbox one joystick we're kind of
wondering<00:02:24.049> if<00:02:24.170> too<00:02:24.349> much<00:02:24.500> taking<00:02:24.890> them<00:02:25.010> on<00:02:25.129> and

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
wondering if too much taking them on and

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:26.860 
wondering if too much taking them on and
off<00:02:25.430> is<00:02:25.700> going<00:02:25.879> to<00:02:25.939> start<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.209> deteriorate<00:02:26.420> the

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
off is going to start to deteriorate the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.470 
off is going to start to deteriorate the
side<00:02:27.290> of<00:02:27.439> this<00:02:27.560> we<00:02:28.549> don't<00:02:28.670> know<00:02:28.909> I<00:02:29.090> mean<00:02:29.299> it's

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
side of this we don't know I mean it's

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.360 
side of this we don't know I mean it's
all<00:02:29.629> good<00:02:29.900> in<00:02:30.290> time<00:02:30.469> as<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:30.890> can<00:02:30.980> see<00:02:31.099> I've<00:02:31.219> got

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
all good in time as you can see I've got

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.140 
all good in time as you can see I've got
the<00:02:31.549> one<00:02:31.670> on<00:02:31.700> here<00:02:32.409> for<00:02:33.409> the<00:02:33.500> CQC<00:02:34.129> and<00:02:34.310> it's

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
the one on here for the CQC and it's

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.300 
the one on here for the CQC and it's
really<00:02:35.540> really<00:02:36.379> nice<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.799> real<00:02:36.950> comfortable

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
really really nice it's real comfortable

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:39.610 
really really nice it's real comfortable
me<00:02:38.209> personally<00:02:38.659> I<00:02:38.689> didn't<00:02:38.930> like<00:02:39.109> how<00:02:39.260> small

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
me personally I didn't like how small

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.649 
me personally I didn't like how small
these<00:02:39.889> were<00:02:40.159> so<00:02:40.609> I<00:02:40.639> may<00:02:40.909> run<00:02:41.120> one<00:02:41.269> of<00:02:41.359> these<00:02:41.420> on

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:41.659 
these were so I may run one of these on

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.080 
these were so I may run one of these on
both<00:02:42.139> sides<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:42.739> haven't<00:02:43.489> gotten<00:02:43.639> to<00:02:43.790> use<00:02:43.939> it

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
both sides I haven't gotten to use it

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.240 
both sides I haven't gotten to use it
too<00:02:44.239> much<00:02:44.450> with<00:02:44.739> Call<00:02:45.739> of<00:02:45.769> Duty<00:02:46.099> and

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
too much with Call of Duty and

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.860 
too much with Call of Duty and
Battlefield<00:02:46.310> stuff<00:02:46.849> like<00:02:47.000> that<00:02:47.180> so<00:02:47.629> this

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
Battlefield stuff like that so this

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.360 
Battlefield stuff like that so this
right<00:02:48.019> here<00:02:48.079> is<00:02:48.200> nice<00:02:48.409> and<00:02:48.620> then<00:02:48.859> if<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.099> look

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.370 
right here is nice and then if you look

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.520 
right here is nice and then if you look
we<00:02:49.760> also<00:02:49.879> have<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.299> sniper<00:02:50.569> on<00:02:50.900> the<00:02:51.139> day<00:02:51.379> one

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
we also have the sniper on the day one

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.830 
we also have the sniper on the day one
edition<00:02:51.650> right<00:02:52.459> here<00:02:52.760> this<00:02:53.359> is<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.599> main<00:02:53.689> one

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
edition right here this is the main one

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.379 
edition right here this is the main one
that<00:02:54.049> Camel<00:02:54.349> is<00:02:54.379> going<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> be<00:02:54.680> running<00:02:55.389> you've

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:56.389 
that Camel is going to be running you've

00:02:56.389 --> 00:02:57.629 
that Camel is going to be running you've
seen<00:02:56.540> him<00:02:56.689> in<00:02:56.720> a<00:02:56.840> few<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.049> my<00:02:57.139> other<00:02:57.290> videos

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
seen him in a few of my other videos

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:00.550 
seen him in a few of my other videos
this<00:02:58.639> one<00:02:58.849> right<00:02:58.939> here<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.450> me<00:02:59.629> it's<00:02:59.840> still<00:03:00.049> it

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
this one right here to me it's still it

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.369 
this one right here to me it's still it
feels<00:03:00.769> a<00:03:00.889> little<00:03:01.159> bit<00:03:01.250> higher<00:03:01.400> than<00:03:01.669> the<00:03:01.790> Xbox

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
feels a little bit higher than the Xbox

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.800 
feels a little bit higher than the Xbox
360<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:04.700> can<00:03:04.760> look<00:03:05.180> at<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.359> difference<00:03:05.750> here

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
360 you can look at the difference here

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.259 
360 you can look at the difference here
the<00:03:06.439> joystick<00:03:06.889> on<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.280> Xbox<00:03:07.609> one<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:07.909> already

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
the joystick on the Xbox one is already

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.360 
the joystick on the Xbox one is already
higher<00:03:08.540> so<00:03:09.260> I<00:03:09.290> think<00:03:09.530> it's<00:03:09.650> just<00:03:09.799> a<00:03:09.859> little<00:03:10.099> bit

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
higher so I think it's just a little bit

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.860 
higher so I think it's just a little bit
higher<00:03:10.519> plus<00:03:10.790> this<00:03:10.969> one's<00:03:11.180> down<00:03:11.389> where<00:03:11.629> I<00:03:11.659> was

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
higher plus this one's down where I was

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.000 
higher plus this one's down where I was
been<00:03:12.079> running<00:03:12.349> one<00:03:12.500> that's<00:03:12.680> a<00:03:12.739> little<00:03:12.889> bit

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:13.010 
been running one that's a little bit

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.220 
been running one that's a little bit
more<00:03:13.069> concave<00:03:13.549> so<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:14.750> going<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:14.959> really

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
more concave so it's going to really

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.659 
more concave so it's going to really
depend<00:03:15.439> on<00:03:15.739> you<00:03:15.950> and<00:03:16.189> your<00:03:16.280> personal

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:16.669 
depend on you and your personal

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.209 
depend on you and your personal
preference<00:03:17.799> it's<00:03:18.799> something<00:03:19.040> you're<00:03:19.129> going

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.219 
preference it's something you're going

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:21.459 
preference it's something you're going
to<00:03:19.280> work<00:03:19.489> through<00:03:19.790> if<00:03:20.419> you<00:03:20.599> haven't<00:03:20.930> ever<00:03:21.079> used

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:21.469 
to work through if you haven't ever used

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.709 
to work through if you haven't ever used
one<00:03:21.709> before<00:03:21.919> in<00:03:22.430> the<00:03:22.639> first<00:03:22.849> place<00:03:23.120> it's

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:23.719 
one before in the first place it's

00:03:23.719 --> 00:03:25.689 
one before in the first place it's
probably<00:03:24.290> going<00:03:24.439> to<00:03:24.500> take<00:03:24.560> you<00:03:24.859> about<00:03:24.949> I<00:03:25.340> would

00:03:25.689 --> 00:03:25.699 
probably going to take you about I would

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:27.640 
probably going to take you about I would
imagine<00:03:25.849> about<00:03:26.030> 20<00:03:26.510> games<00:03:26.720> to<00:03:26.959> really<00:03:27.440> start

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
imagine about 20 games to really start

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.189 
imagine about 20 games to really start
to<00:03:27.709> get<00:03:27.859> the<00:03:28.010> hang<00:03:28.190> of<00:03:28.310> these<00:03:28.629> your<00:03:29.629> your<00:03:29.959> hands

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:30.199 
to get the hang of these your your hands
