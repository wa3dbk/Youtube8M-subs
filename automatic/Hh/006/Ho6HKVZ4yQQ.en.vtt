she's holding the camera for me so I can
get<00:00:32.800> this<00:00:33.010> out<00:00:33.220> because<00:00:33.610> it's<00:00:33.940> pretty<00:00:34.750> big<00:00:42.090> and

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.959 

I<00:00:47.140> also<00:00:47.710> have<00:00:49.530> these<00:00:50.530> are<00:00:50.710> the<00:00:50.739> pads<00:00:51.190> come<00:00:51.820> with

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
I also have these are the pads come with

00:00:51.969 --> 00:01:08.730 
I also have these are the pads come with
it<00:00:56.879> open<00:00:57.879> this<00:00:58.149> together<00:00:58.539> okay<00:00:59.199> so<00:01:06.960> I<00:01:07.960> decided

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
it open this together okay so I decided

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.410 
it open this together okay so I decided
I<00:01:08.979> thought<00:01:09.189> I<00:01:09.220> needed<00:01:09.549> one<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:09.850> these<00:01:10.090> I<00:01:10.360> don't

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
I thought I needed one of these I don't

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.080 
I thought I needed one of these I don't
know<00:01:10.600> why<00:01:10.869> I<00:01:11.320> have<00:01:11.619> a<00:01:11.650> million<00:01:12.040> other<00:01:12.100> machines

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
know why I have a million other machines

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.719 
know why I have a million other machines
I<00:01:13.270> don't<00:01:13.479> even<00:01:13.600> use<00:01:13.930> that<00:01:14.409> I<00:01:14.710> wanted<00:01:15.490> something

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:15.729 
I don't even use that I wanted something

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:17.399 
I don't even use that I wanted something
that<00:01:15.970> I<00:01:16.150> could<00:01:16.330> cut<00:01:16.570> that<00:01:16.780> twelve<00:01:17.229> by<00:01:17.380> twelve

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:17.409 
that I could cut that twelve by twelve

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.620 
that I could cut that twelve by twelve
paper<00:01:17.920> on<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:18.400> we<00:01:18.490> have<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> Stampin<00:01:19.150> Up<00:01:19.299> and

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
paper on that we have a Stampin Up and

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.319 
paper on that we have a Stampin Up and
this<00:01:20.470> is<00:01:20.680> probably<00:01:21.280> the<00:01:21.460> best<00:01:21.579> machine<00:01:22.030> to<00:01:22.150> do

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
this is probably the best machine to do

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.380 
this is probably the best machine to do
that<00:01:22.799> okay<00:01:23.799> so<00:01:23.829> everybody's<00:01:24.490> deserted<00:01:25.090> me<00:01:25.240> and

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
that okay so everybody's deserted me and

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.219 
that okay so everybody's deserted me and
my<00:01:25.509> family

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
my family

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.810 
my family
so<00:01:26.320> it's<00:01:26.470> gonna<00:01:26.590> be<00:01:26.770> me<00:01:26.920> and<00:01:26.950> you<00:01:27.100> we're<00:01:27.729> gonna

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
so it's gonna be me and you we're gonna

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.190 
so it's gonna be me and you we're gonna
try<00:01:28.030> and<00:01:28.150> figure<00:01:28.270> this<00:01:28.479> out<00:01:28.630> together<00:01:28.810> but

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:29.200 
try and figure this out together but

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.480 
try and figure this out together but
this<00:01:29.770> apparently<00:01:30.280> is<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.759> adapter<00:01:31.270> or<00:01:32.140> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
this apparently is the adapter or the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.240 
this apparently is the adapter or the
sliding<00:01:33.490> tray<00:01:33.520> pad<00:01:33.970> and<00:01:34.439> then<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.619> tells<00:01:35.860> me<00:01:36.070> to

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
sliding tray pad and then it tells me to

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:41.789 
sliding tray pad and then it tells me to
put<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.409> adapter<00:01:38.409> pad<00:01:39.060> which<00:01:40.060> is<00:01:40.090> this<00:01:40.799> into

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
put the adapter pad which is this into

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:48.270 
put the adapter pad which is this into
the<00:01:41.920> tray<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:43.200> then<00:01:44.200> um<00:01:46.860> okay<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:47.890> it<00:01:48.100> says

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
the tray and then um okay so it says

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.880 
the tray and then um okay so it says
this<00:01:48.430> should<00:01:48.610> now<00:01:49.110> be<00:01:50.110> able<00:01:50.259> to<00:01:50.409> move<00:01:50.649> back<00:01:50.860> and

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
this should now be able to move back and

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:53.789 
this should now be able to move back and
forth<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.810> doesn't<00:01:53.140> seem<00:01:53.290> like<00:01:53.439> it's<00:01:53.590> moving

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:53.799 
forth it doesn't seem like it's moving

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.209 
forth it doesn't seem like it's moving
though<00:01:54.009> does<00:01:54.219> it<00:01:54.399> I'm<00:01:54.820> pushing<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.360> I<00:01:56.219> don't

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:57.219 
though does it I'm pushing it I don't

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:00.179 
though does it I'm pushing it I don't
see<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.460> moving<00:01:57.670> I<00:01:58.680> wonder<00:01:59.680> if<00:01:59.740> I<00:01:59.799> have<00:02:00.009> it<00:02:00.100> at

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:00.189 
see it moving I wonder if I have it at

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:02.639 
see it moving I wonder if I have it at
the<00:02:00.310> end<00:02:00.869> which<00:02:01.869> is<00:02:01.990> a<00:02:02.020> very<00:02:02.289> good<00:02:02.469> possibility

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
the end which is a very good possibility

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.050 
the end which is a very good possibility
but<00:02:03.070> I<00:02:03.130> think<00:02:03.310> it's<00:02:03.430> supposed<00:02:03.579> to<00:02:03.729> slide<00:02:03.939> no

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.060 
but I think it's supposed to slide no

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.030 
but I think it's supposed to slide no
matter<00:02:04.240> what<00:02:04.450> right

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040

camera<00:03:23.489> there<00:03:24.489> we<00:03:24.550> go<00:03:26.220> okay<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.250> it<00:03:27.520> says<00:03:27.670> to

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
camera there we go okay so it says to

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.670 
camera there we go okay so it says to
put<00:03:28.030> my<00:03:28.150> my<00:03:28.720> material<00:03:29.910> which<00:03:30.910> will<00:03:31.060> be<00:03:31.680> this

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
put my my material which will be this

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:43.200 
put my my material which will be this
paper<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.280> top<00:03:37.739> place<00:03:38.739> the<00:03:39.040> crease<00:03:39.310> pad<00:03:40.950> which

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:43.210 
paper on top place the crease pad which

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:53.580 
paper on top place the crease pad which
on<00:03:44.210> top<00:03:44.600> of<00:03:44.960> the<00:03:45.170> paper<00:03:45.440> to<00:03:46.220> make<00:03:46.370> the<00:03:47.230> sandwich

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.940 

okay<00:03:55.330> and<00:03:56.330> then<00:03:56.480> I'm<00:03:56.630> supposed<00:03:56.810> to<00:03:57.200> I<00:03:57.470> guess

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
okay and then I'm supposed to I guess

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.890 
okay and then I'm supposed to I guess
cut<00:03:58.720> okay<00:03:59.720> there<00:03:59.870> we<00:03:59.990> go

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:01.900 
cut okay there we go

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.980 
cut okay there we go
this<00:04:02.900> turns<00:04:03.620> really<00:04:03.920> easy<00:04:04.130> actually<00:04:04.990> quite

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
this turns really easy actually quite

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.500 
this turns really easy actually quite
surprised

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
surprised

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:26.410 
surprised
hopefully<00:04:08.510> it<00:04:09.110> cut<00:04:18.190> okay<00:04:20.440> there<00:04:21.440> we<00:04:21.560> go<00:04:25.420> okay

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:26.420 
hopefully it cut okay there we go okay

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.710 
hopefully it cut okay there we go okay
so<00:04:26.450> there's<00:04:26.810> my<00:04:27.020> paper<00:04:27.290> and<00:04:28.040> now<00:04:28.220> I<00:04:28.610> just<00:04:29.450> need

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
so there's my paper and now I just need

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:32.140 
so there's my paper and now I just need
to<00:04:29.870> figure<00:04:30.050> out<00:04:30.170> how<00:04:30.320> to<00:04:30.380> put<00:04:30.590> the<00:04:31.150> bags

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
to figure out how to put the bags

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.470 
to figure out how to put the bags
together<00:04:32.570> here's<00:04:32.930> my<00:04:33.050> crease<00:04:33.290> lines<00:04:34.210> and<00:04:35.210> fold

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
together here's my crease lines and fold

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:44.550 
together here's my crease lines and fold
those<00:04:35.660> up<00:04:37.360> and<00:04:38.860> I'm<00:04:39.860> gonna<00:04:39.980> take<00:04:40.190> my<00:04:41.230> snail

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:05:11.400 

down<00:04:46.060> beside<00:04:51.100> my<00:04:52.100> bag<00:04:52.310> together<00:04:52.669> there

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.280 

I'm<00:05:12.410> just<00:05:12.650> a<00:05:12.830> on<00:05:12.890> there<00:05:13.300> hold<00:05:14.300> that<00:05:14.510> in<00:05:16.540> I<00:05:17.540> use

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 
I'm just a on there hold that in I use

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.560 
I'm just a on there hold that in I use
something<00:05:18.710> like<00:05:18.740> that<00:05:18.890> boom<00:05:19.880> folder<00:05:20.390> or

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
something like that boom folder or

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.780 
something like that boom folder or
something<00:05:21.020> but<00:05:23.890> okay<00:05:24.890> in<00:05:24.980> there<00:05:25.100> are<00:05:25.250> little

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:25.790 
something but okay in there are little

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:35.320 
something but okay in there are little
side<00:05:26.650> pockets<00:05:27.650> here<00:05:33.460> and<00:05:34.460> again<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.880> probably

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
side pockets here and again I probably

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.060 
side pockets here and again I probably
wouldn't<00:05:35.570> have<00:05:35.630> done<00:05:35.810> this<00:05:35.960> had<00:05:36.530> I<00:05:36.560> known<00:05:36.860> I

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:37.070 
wouldn't have done this had I known I

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:39.220 
wouldn't have done this had I known I
probably<00:05:37.250> want<00:05:37.490> to<00:05:37.520> use<00:05:37.580> this<00:05:37.910> pattern<00:05:38.230> this

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
probably want to use this pattern this

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:44.620 
probably want to use this pattern this
pattern<00:05:40.930> have<00:05:41.930> not<00:05:42.140> seen<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:43.670> makes<00:05:44.270> the<00:05:44.450> bag

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:44.630 
pattern have not seen it makes the bag

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:46.960 
pattern have not seen it makes the bag
look<00:05:44.900> crooked<00:05:45.400> because<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:46.550> way<00:05:46.640> the<00:05:46.790> pattern

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
look crooked because the way the pattern

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.310 
look crooked because the way the pattern
is<00:05:47.270> filling<00:05:47.570> so<00:05:47.690> that's<00:05:47.870> something<00:05:48.200> you're

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
is filling so that's something you're

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:49.540 
is filling so that's something you're
probably<00:05:48.440> gonna<00:05:48.680> have<00:05:48.920> to<00:05:48.950> watch<00:05:49.190> if<00:05:49.400> these

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
probably gonna have to watch if these

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:52.930 
probably gonna have to watch if these
dies<00:05:49.790> if<00:05:50.030> you<00:05:50.240> have<00:05:50.420> a<00:05:50.450> pattern<00:05:50.720> paper<00:05:51.670> and<00:05:52.670> the

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
dies if you have a pattern paper and the

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:54.700 
dies if you have a pattern paper and the
way<00:05:53.030> that<00:05:53.240> died<00:05:53.450> was<00:05:53.720> kind<00:05:54.050> of<00:05:54.110> on<00:05:54.170> an<00:05:54.290> angle

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:54.710 
way that died was kind of on an angle

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:56.020 
way that died was kind of on an angle
and<00:05:54.740> you're<00:05:54.920> probably<00:05:55.100> gonna<00:05:55.310> have<00:05:55.550> to<00:05:55.610> change

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
and you're probably gonna have to change

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.840 
and you're probably gonna have to change
your<00:05:56.180> pattern<00:05:56.390> paper<00:05:57.070> so<00:05:58.070> that<00:05:58.280> it<00:05:58.400> looks<00:05:58.610> like

00:05:58.840 --> 00:05:58.850 
your pattern paper so that it looks like

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:02.080 
your pattern paper so that it looks like
bad<00:05:59.090> but<00:05:59.870> that's<00:06:00.230> the<00:06:00.470> new<00:06:00.620> Big<00:06:01.160> Shot<00:06:01.400> Pro<00:06:01.640> I

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
bad but that's the new Big Shot Pro I

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.110 
bad but that's the new Big Shot Pro I
don't<00:06:02.900> know<00:06:02.990> I'm<00:06:03.200> still<00:06:03.470> kind<00:06:03.740> of<00:06:03.890> out<00:06:04.220> on<00:06:04.730> that

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.120 
don't know I'm still kind of out on that

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.710 
don't know I'm still kind of out on that
it's<00:06:05.360> very<00:06:05.750> big<00:06:06.880> I'll<00:06:07.880> show<00:06:08.090> it<00:06:08.180> again<00:06:08.360> I<00:06:08.390> set

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:08.720 
it's very big I'll show it again I set

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:12.400 
it's very big I'll show it again I set
it<00:06:08.840> on<00:06:08.930> the<00:06:09.050> floor<00:06:09.080> very<00:06:10.070> big<00:06:10.460> very<00:06:11.419> heavy<00:06:11.840> too

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
it on the floor very big very heavy too

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.440 
it on the floor very big very heavy too
so<00:06:12.830> it's<00:06:12.980> pretty<00:06:13.430> much<00:06:13.550> a<00:06:13.700> machine<00:06:14.090> that<00:06:14.270> where

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:14.450 
so it's pretty much a machine that where

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.390 
so it's pretty much a machine that where
you<00:06:14.570> put<00:06:14.780> it<00:06:14.960> in<00:06:15.200> your<00:06:15.410> office<00:06:15.560> it's<00:06:16.040> one<00:06:16.190> thing

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
you put it in your office it's one thing

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.950 
you put it in your office it's one thing
that<00:06:16.550> it<00:06:16.640> does<00:06:16.820> have<00:06:17.060> for<00:06:17.330> it<00:06:17.390> I<00:06:17.450> will<00:06:17.600> say<00:06:17.840> is

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
that it does have for it I will say is

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:21.720 
that it does have for it I will say is
that<00:06:17.990> I<00:06:18.140> do<00:06:18.260> like<00:06:18.530> the<00:06:18.710> size<00:06:18.950> of<00:06:19.190> the<00:06:19.280> bags

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:21.730 

00:06:21.730 --> 00:06:24.070 

you're<00:06:22.730> trying<00:06:23.000> to<00:06:23.090> think<00:06:23.240> of<00:06:23.419> what<00:06:23.540> I've<00:06:23.630> had

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
you're trying to think of what I've had

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:29.230 
you're trying to think of what I've had
to<00:06:24.110> compare<00:06:24.860> it<00:06:25.040> with<00:06:25.070> for<00:06:25.640> you<00:06:25.880> but<00:06:26.810> um<00:06:28.240> you

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:29.240 
to compare it with for you but um you

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:31.030 
to compare it with for you but um you
know<00:06:29.270> it's<00:06:29.810> as<00:06:29.960> tall<00:06:30.169> as<00:06:30.380> this<00:06:30.590> which<00:06:30.830> i<00:06:30.980> think

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.040 
know it's as tall as this which i think

00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:37.150 
know it's as tall as this which i think
is<00:06:31.280> like<00:06:31.310> a<00:06:32.020> four<00:06:33.020> by<00:06:33.169> six<00:06:33.250> yeah<00:06:34.250> so<00:06:36.160> it's

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
is like a four by six yeah so it's

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:43.720 
is like a four by six yeah so it's
definitely<00:06:37.790> a<00:06:37.910> lot<00:06:38.470> bigger<00:06:39.470> you<00:06:41.770> know<00:06:42.800> like

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:43.730 
definitely a lot bigger you know like

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.400 
definitely a lot bigger you know like
six<00:06:44.860> six<00:06:45.860> tall<00:06:46.220> so<00:06:46.730> if<00:06:47.450> anything<00:06:47.750> I<00:06:47.990> like<00:06:48.200> the

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410 
six six tall so if anything I like the

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.230 
six six tall so if anything I like the
actual<00:06:48.770> size<00:06:49.190> of<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:49.460> other<00:06:49.730> products<00:06:50.180> that

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
actual size of the other products that

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.860 
actual size of the other products that
you're<00:06:50.419> getting<00:06:51.669> with<00:06:52.669> the<00:06:52.790> pro<00:06:52.970> thanks<00:06:53.720> for
