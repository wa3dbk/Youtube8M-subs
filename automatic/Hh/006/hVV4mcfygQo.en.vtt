demonstrate<00:01:58.830> what<00:01:59.400> happens<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.909> you<00:02:00.060> move<00:02:00.299> the

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
demonstrate what happens as you move the

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.380 
demonstrate what happens as you move the
deflector<00:02:01.110> closer<00:02:01.619> and<00:02:02.100> closer<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:03.180> the

deflector closer and closer to the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.480 
deflector closer and closer to the
subject<00:02:03.990> let's<00:02:04.470> take<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> look<00:02:05.130> at<00:02:05.250> how<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
subject let's take a look at how that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.240 
subject let's take a look at how that
works<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.119> the<00:02:06.479> diffuser<00:02:06.990> is<00:02:07.350> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> turn

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
works and the diffuser is going to turn
