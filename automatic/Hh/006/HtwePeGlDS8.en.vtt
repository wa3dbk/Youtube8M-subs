00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
I don't know if you can see it's kind of

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.600 
I don't know if you can see it's kind of
big<00:02:25.410> it's<00:02:26.410> a<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.770> big<00:02:26.950> I<00:02:27.190> don't<00:02:27.370> know<00:02:27.430> if

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
big it's a little big I don't know if

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.790 
big it's a little big I don't know if
you<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:27.730> your<00:02:28.030> stuff<00:02:28.180> big<00:02:28.480> then<00:02:29.260> it's

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
you like your stuff big then it's

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.380 
you like your stuff big then it's
probably<00:02:30.130> okay<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:30.459> I<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.850> myself<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.270> little

more<00:02:31.480> form-fitting<00:02:32.170> so<00:02:32.320> I<00:02:32.350> would<00:02:32.590> probably<00:02:32.680> go

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
more form-fitting so I would probably go

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.100 
more form-fitting so I would probably go
with<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.070> large<00:02:33.340> which<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.239> very<00:02:34.510> rarely<00:02:34.600> wear

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
with the large which I very rarely wear

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.870 
with the large which I very rarely wear
it<00:02:35.290> large<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.890> that<00:02:36.040> tells<00:02:36.280> you<00:02:36.400> that<00:02:36.430> it<00:02:36.670> fits

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
it large so that tells you that it fits

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.260 
it large so that tells you that it fits
