this<00:00:13.190> guy<00:00:13.580> comes<00:00:13.910> straight<00:00:14.570> out<00:00:14.629> and<00:00:15.139> he's

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
this guy comes straight out and he's

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.370 
this guy comes straight out and he's
loose<00:00:16.340> already

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
loose already

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.470 
loose already
okay<00:00:18.380> set<00:00:19.160> your<00:00:19.340> big<00:00:19.550> pieces<00:00:19.970> over<00:00:20.240> to<00:00:20.360> the

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
okay set your big pieces over to the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.529 
okay set your big pieces over to the
side<00:00:21.579> and<00:00:22.579> we're<00:00:22.759> probably<00:00:23.000> going<00:00:23.210> to<00:00:23.300> need<00:00:23.419> to

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:23.539 
side and we're probably going to need to

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:25.900 
side and we're probably going to need to
get<00:00:23.660> another<00:00:24.070> because<00:00:25.070> this<00:00:25.250> is<00:00:25.460> the<00:00:25.640> heart

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
get another because this is the heart

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.669 
get another because this is the heart
right<00:00:26.210> here<00:00:26.449> where<00:00:26.660> your<00:00:26.810> needle<00:00:27.019> is<00:00:27.259> right

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
right here where your needle is right

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:29.259 
right here where your needle is right
we're<00:00:27.949> going<00:00:28.070> to<00:00:28.130> need<00:00:28.279> another<00:00:28.460> clean<00:00:28.970> rag

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:29.269 
we're going to need another clean rag

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:31.960 
we're going to need another clean rag
because<00:00:29.570> that<00:00:29.839> is<00:00:29.960> awful<00:00:30.640> you<00:00:31.640> know<00:00:31.669> what<00:00:31.939> I

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
because that is awful you know what I

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:38.049 
because that is awful you know what I
need<00:00:32.300> to<00:00:32.449> know<00:00:32.599> if<00:00:32.720> you've<00:00:32.930> got<00:00:36.699> one<00:00:37.699> things

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
need to know if you've got one things

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:45.850 
need to know if you've got one things
coming<00:00:38.420> up<00:00:38.540> fairly<00:00:39.250> early<00:00:40.250> wood<00:00:40.610> colored<00:00:44.860> with

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
coming up fairly early wood colored with

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.660 
coming up fairly early wood colored with
solvent<00:00:46.550> loosening<00:00:47.090> the<00:00:47.530> varnish<00:00:48.530> and<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
solvent loosening the varnish and the

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.349 
solvent loosening the varnish and the
the<00:00:50.210> filing<00:00:50.989> action<00:00:51.559> of<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.829> wood<00:00:52.359> then

00:00:53.349 --> 00:00:53.359 
the filing action of the wood then

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:54.819 
the filing action of the wood then
you're<00:00:53.600> pretty<00:00:53.870> good<00:00:54.109> because<00:00:54.530> you're<00:00:54.710> not

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
you're pretty good because you're not

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.509 
you're pretty good because you're not
going<00:00:55.039> to<00:00:55.129> harm<00:00:55.399> that<00:00:55.519> steel<00:00:56.800> or<00:00:57.800> even<00:00:57.829> the

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
going to harm that steel or even the

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.819 
going to harm that steel or even the
brass<00:00:58.820> brush<00:00:59.269> that<00:00:59.600> we<00:00:59.719> had<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:00.260> kits<00:01:00.559> was

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:00.829 
brass brush that we had in the kits was

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:03.700 
brass brush that we had in the kits was
virtually<00:01:01.430> worthless<00:01:02.230> because<00:01:03.230> it<00:01:03.410> was<00:01:03.530> so

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
virtually worthless because it was so

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.490 
virtually worthless because it was so
soft<00:01:04.009> wasn't<00:01:04.940> to<00:01:05.479> avoid<00:01:05.810> eroding<00:01:06.800> the<00:01:06.920> stem

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:08.500 
soft wasn't to avoid eroding the stem

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:11.109 
soft wasn't to avoid eroding the stem
but<00:01:09.500> that's<00:01:09.740> where<00:01:09.979> your<00:01:10.130> carbon<00:01:10.490> buildup<00:01:10.910> is

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:11.119 
but that's where your carbon buildup is

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.600 
but that's where your carbon buildup is
the<00:01:11.240> most<00:01:11.509> because<00:01:11.960> it's<00:01:12.170> static<00:01:12.770> where<00:01:13.460> as

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
the most because it's static where as

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.940 
the most because it's static where as
the<00:01:13.789> needle<00:01:14.030> moves<00:01:14.479> and<00:01:15.140> when<00:01:15.470> the<00:01:15.590> needle

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
the needle moves and when the needle

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.120 
the needle moves and when the needle
pounds<00:01:16.729> it<00:01:17.450> has<00:01:17.869> a<00:01:17.899> tendency<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.679> knock<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
pounds it has a tendency to knock the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.940 
pounds it has a tendency to knock the
carbon<00:01:19.580> off<00:01:19.789> but<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:20.869> get<00:01:21.050> this<00:01:21.229> Ridge<00:01:21.619> of

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
carbon off but you get this Ridge of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.460 
carbon off but you get this Ridge of
carbon<00:01:22.490> around<00:01:22.789> that<00:01:23.000> hole<00:01:23.300> that<00:01:23.690> obscures

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
carbon around that hole that obscures

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.120 
carbon around that hole that obscures
the<00:01:24.800> flow<00:01:25.160> of<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.459> fuel<00:01:26.500> changes<00:01:27.500> its<00:01:27.709> pattern

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
the flow of the fuel changes its pattern

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.400 
the flow of the fuel changes its pattern
so<00:01:28.459> yeah<00:01:28.670> it<00:01:28.789> changes<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.360> pattern<00:01:29.599> a<00:01:29.959> little

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:30.410 
so yeah it changes the pattern a little

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.180 
so yeah it changes the pattern a little
rock<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:31.130> carbon<00:01:32.000> and<00:01:32.149> a<00:01:32.840> fuel<00:01:33.170> stream<00:01:33.649> is<00:01:33.950> like

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:34.190 
rock of carbon and a fuel stream is like

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.400 
rock of carbon and a fuel stream is like
a<00:01:34.220> rock<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.700> a<00:01:35.000> creek<00:01:35.390> mmm

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
a rock and a creek mmm

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:42.969 
a rock and a creek mmm
creates<00:01:37.099> turbulence<00:01:41.440> but<00:01:42.440> you<00:01:42.619> want<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.860> keep

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
creates turbulence but you want to keep

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.820 
creates turbulence but you want to keep
doing<00:01:43.039> that<00:01:43.459> till<00:01:43.670> you<00:01:43.729> get<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:44.000> clean<00:01:44.360> tip<00:01:44.830> both

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
doing that till you get a clean tip both

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:49.779 
doing that till you get a clean tip both
directions<00:01:46.599> and<00:01:47.679> side<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.890> outside<00:01:49.399> when<00:01:49.700> you

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:49.789 
directions and side and outside when you

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.029 
directions and side and outside when you
get<00:01:49.940> a<00:01:49.970> clean<00:01:50.330> tip<00:01:50.690> you<00:01:51.020> you're<00:01:51.349> done<00:01:51.560> you<00:01:51.860> got

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
get a clean tip you you're done you got

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:53.830 
get a clean tip you you're done you got
all<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> carbon<00:01:52.700> off<00:01:52.849> in<00:01:53.030> it<00:01:53.149> maybe<00:01:53.479> even

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
all the carbon off in it maybe even

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.740 
all the carbon off in it maybe even
squeak<00:01:54.229> like<00:01:54.530> that<00:01:54.739> one<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:55.009> did<00:01:55.220> while<00:01:55.459> ago

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.420 

friction<00:02:02.380> now<00:02:02.710> that<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.160> actual<00:02:04.080> nasal<00:02:05.080> kit

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
friction now that the actual nasal kit

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.990 
friction now that the actual nasal kit
that<00:02:06.430> came<00:02:06.820> to<00:02:07.390> clean<00:02:07.660> the<00:02:07.900> injectors<00:02:08.729> in<00:02:09.729> this

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
that came to clean the injectors in this

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.100 
that came to clean the injectors in this
service<00:02:10.509> were<00:02:10.899> sandalwood<00:02:12.300> are<00:02:13.300> not<00:02:13.660> orange

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
service were sandalwood are not orange

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.950 
service were sandalwood are not orange
would<00:02:14.290> our<00:02:14.560> arms<00:02:15.310> when<00:02:15.520> sticks<00:02:15.910> that<00:02:16.720> were<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:16.960 
would our arms when sticks that were a

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:19.770 
would our arms when sticks that were a
little<00:02:17.230> harder<00:02:17.650> than<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:17.890> toothpick<00:02:18.490> but<00:02:18.790> you

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
little harder than the toothpick but you

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.360 
little harder than the toothpick but you
know<00:02:19.900> you<00:02:20.020> can<00:02:20.170> buy<00:02:20.380> orange<00:02:20.680> wood<00:02:20.860> sticks<00:02:21.220> at

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
know you can buy orange wood sticks at

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.190 
know you can buy orange wood sticks at
Walmart<00:02:21.850> in<00:02:22.000> them<00:02:22.180> yeah<00:02:22.480> but<00:02:22.720> you're<00:02:22.990> going<00:02:23.140> to

Walmart in them yeah but you're going to
do<00:02:23.380> this<00:02:23.590> once<00:02:23.980> every<00:02:24.250> see<00:02:24.940> right<00:02:25.150> how<00:02:25.810> many

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
do this once every see right how many

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.620 
do this once every see right how many
years<00:02:26.530> you'll<00:02:27.520> buy<00:02:27.730> those<00:02:28.000> things<00:02:28.270> and<00:02:28.450> forget

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
years you'll buy those things and forget

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.160 
years you'll buy those things and forget
where<00:02:28.960> you<00:02:29.050> put<00:02:29.580> but<00:02:30.580> toothpicks<00:02:31.120> I<00:02:31.270> can<00:02:31.600> keep

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
where you put but toothpicks I can keep

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.920 
where you put but toothpicks I can keep
up<00:02:32.350> with<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.860> yeah<00:02:33.580> and<00:02:33.910> everybody's<00:02:34.570> get<00:02:34.750> to

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
up with you yeah and everybody's get to

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.130 
up with you yeah and everybody's get to
six<00:02:36.930> now<00:02:37.930> on<00:02:38.200> the<00:02:38.680> shoulders<00:02:39.490> up<00:02:39.730> here<00:02:40.140> you

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
six now on the shoulders up here you

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:42.690 
six now on the shoulders up here you
couldn't<00:02:41.470> apply<00:02:41.740> too<00:02:41.800> much<00:02:42.010> pressure<00:02:42.400> with

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
couldn't apply too much pressure with

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.449 
couldn't apply too much pressure with
exotic<00:02:43.240> how<00:02:43.600> about<00:02:43.810> on<00:02:44.020> the<00:02:44.200> little<00:02:44.500> now<00:02:45.070> that

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
exotic how about on the little now that

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.360 
exotic how about on the little now that
that<00:02:45.760> piece<00:02:46.150> of<00:02:46.360> steel<00:02:46.630> right<00:02:47.110> there<00:02:47.440> is<00:02:47.680> very

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
that piece of steel right there is very

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.620 
that piece of steel right there is very
very<00:02:49.120> very<00:02:50.670> so<00:02:51.670> I<00:02:51.700> can<00:02:51.970> increase<00:02:52.239> friction

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
very very so I can increase friction

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.400 
very very so I can increase friction
life<00:02:53.110> yeah<00:02:53.500> yeah<00:02:54.360> think<00:02:55.360> about<00:02:55.600> how<00:02:55.780> hard<00:02:56.080> that

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
life yeah yeah think about how hard that

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.280 
life yeah yeah think about how hard that
has<00:02:56.650> to<00:02:56.800> be<00:02:56.890> yeah<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.459> how<00:02:57.700> strong<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.660> steel

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
has to be yeah and how strong that steel

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250 
has to be yeah and how strong that steel
has<00:02:59.650> to<00:02:59.680> be<00:02:59.920> that's<00:03:00.580> to<00:03:00.790> be<00:03:00.940> incredibly<00:03:01.840> strong

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
has to be that's to be incredibly strong

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.970 
has to be that's to be incredibly strong
because<00:03:02.920> of<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:03.459> pounding<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> gets<00:03:04.980> every

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
because of the pounding it gets every

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.449 
because of the pounding it gets every
time<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.310> cylinder<00:03:06.730> fires<00:03:07.350> it<00:03:08.350> pounds<00:03:09.280> it's

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
time the cylinder fires it pounds it's

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.720 
time the cylinder fires it pounds it's
only<00:03:09.880> at<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.209> top<00:03:10.450> yeah<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:12.070> might<00:03:12.340> be<00:03:12.370> where

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
only at the top yeah that might be where

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:14.490 
only at the top yeah that might be where
it<00:03:12.850> was<00:03:12.970> rubbing<00:03:13.330> back<00:03:13.510> and<00:03:13.690> forth<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.140> polish

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
it was rubbing back and forth and polish

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.620 
it was rubbing back and forth and polish
show<00:03:14.950> that<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.340> goes<00:03:15.549> in<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.060> out<00:03:16.120> of<00:03:16.299> its<00:03:16.420> own

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
show that it goes in and out of its own

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.840 
show that it goes in and out of its own
trial<00:03:17.049> without<00:03:18.000> see<00:03:19.000> it<00:03:19.120> falls<00:03:19.450> out<00:03:19.780> low<00:03:20.850> yeah

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
trial without see it falls out low yeah

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.229 
trial without see it falls out low yeah
and<00:03:22.600> then<00:03:22.720> goes<00:03:22.959> back<00:03:22.989> in<00:03:23.530> little<00:03:24.519> little<00:03:24.970> tune

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
and then goes back in little little tune

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.650 
and then goes back in little little tune
okay<00:03:26.160> alright<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:27.640> we've<00:03:27.790> got<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.150> one<00:03:28.330> clean

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
okay alright so we've got that one clean

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.020 
okay alright so we've got that one clean
so<00:03:29.260> we'll<00:03:29.440> put<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.769> back<00:03:29.799> together<00:03:30.190> into<00:03:30.670> the

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
so we'll put it back together into the

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.680 
so we'll put it back together into the
case<00:03:31.360> and<00:03:31.720> tighten<00:03:32.650> period<00:03:33.250> you<00:03:34.090> know<00:03:34.239> there's

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
case and tighten period you know there's

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:43.950 
case and tighten period you know there's
no<00:03:34.840> resistance

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.640 

it<00:03:44.960> rolls<00:03:45.800> back<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.610> okay<00:03:47.300> so<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.200> test<00:03:48.470> is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
it rolls back in okay so the test is

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.560 
it rolls back in okay so the test is
will<00:03:48.890> it<00:03:49.010> crawl<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.700> direction<00:03:50.000> I<00:03:50.480> don't

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
will it crawl in that direction I don't

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:53.440 
will it crawl in that direction I don't
know<00:03:50.900> if<00:03:50.990> it'll<00:03:51.250> yeah<00:03:52.250> there<00:03:52.550> went<00:03:52.850> there<00:03:53.210> when

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
know if it'll yeah there went there when

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.800 
know if it'll yeah there went there when
I<00:03:53.480> went<00:03:53.870> is<00:03:54.230> all<00:03:54.620> right
