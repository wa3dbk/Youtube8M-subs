no<00:01:41.720> matter<00:01:41.930> how<00:01:42.050> much<00:01:42.170> you<00:01:42.350> love<00:01:42.500> breasts

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
no matter how much you love breasts

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.800 
no matter how much you love breasts
because<00:01:43.430> it'll<00:01:43.670> dry<00:01:43.880> out<00:01:43.910> so<00:01:44.510> we're<00:01:44.630> going<00:01:44.720> to

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
because it'll dry out so we're going to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.290 
because it'll dry out so we're going to
start<00:01:45.080> by<00:01:45.290> scoring<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.920> chicken<00:01:46.370> which<00:01:47.270> is

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
start by scoring the chicken which is

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.810 
start by scoring the chicken which is
basically<00:01:47.840> making<00:01:48.110> some<00:01:48.740> nice<00:01:48.890> deep<00:01:49.400> gashes

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
basically making some nice deep gashes

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.960 
basically making some nice deep gashes
in<00:01:50.030> it<00:01:50.240> and<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:51.590> idea<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.100> that<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:52.580> allows<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
in it and the idea is that it allows the

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.450 
in it and the idea is that it allows the
flavour<00:01:53.480> to<00:01:53.720> really<00:01:54.110> get<00:01:54.320> into<00:01:54.470> the<00:01:54.680> meat<00:01:54.710> so

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
flavour to really get into the meat so

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.250 
flavour to really get into the meat so
now<00:01:55.610> it's<00:01:55.820> time<00:01:56.030> to<00:01:56.060> marinate<00:01:56.450> our<00:01:56.870> tandoori

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
now it's time to marinate our tandoori

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.260 
now it's time to marinate our tandoori
chicken<00:01:57.410> and<00:01:57.920> this<00:01:58.430> is<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.700> first<00:01:59.000> of<00:01:59.210> two

00:01:59.260 --> 00:01:59.270
