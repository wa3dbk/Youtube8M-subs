00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.520 
one water bucket and I haven't seen this
one<00:01:53.159> actually<00:01:53.369> yet<00:01:53.759> so<00:01:54.119> let's<00:01:55.079> see<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.409> is

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
one actually yet so let's see what it is

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
one actually yet so let's see what it is
I<00:01:55.770> salata<00:01:56.189> cannot<00:01:56.460> be<00:01:56.549> created<00:01:57.299> below<00:01:57.780> layer

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
I salata cannot be created below layer

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.940 
I salata cannot be created below layer
16<00:01:58.500> oh<00:01:59.930> okay<00:02:00.930> because<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.290> are<00:02:01.439> in<00:02:01.469> a<00:02:01.619> flat

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
16 oh okay because we are in a flat

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.300 
16 oh okay because we are in a flat
world<00:02:02.310> here<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.360> what<00:02:03.509> we'll<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:05.210> you

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
world here so what we'll do you

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.160 
world here so what we'll do you
is<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:08.259> higher<00:02:08.530> than<00:02:08.560> 16<00:02:09.929> which<00:02:10.929> is<00:02:11.080> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
is go higher than 16 which is the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.740 
is go higher than 16 which is the
diamond<00:02:11.530> 11<00:02:11.860> the<00:02:12.700> diamond<00:02:13.090> another<00:02:13.330> Lucia

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
diamond 11 the diamond another Lucia

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.140 
diamond 11 the diamond another Lucia
Keenan<00:02:14.200> under<00:02:14.500> okay<00:02:15.099> so<00:02:15.670> we'll<00:02:15.790> just<00:02:15.819> do<00:02:16.000> this

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
Keenan under okay so we'll just do this

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.240 
Keenan under okay so we'll just do this
and<00:02:16.480> there<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:17.080> it's<00:02:17.349> the<00:02:17.440> instant<00:02:17.830> ladder

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
and there you go it's the instant ladder

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.949 
and there you go it's the instant ladder
and<00:02:19.000> I<00:02:19.060> guess<00:02:19.239> this<00:02:19.360> is<00:02:19.510> really<00:02:19.660> good<00:02:19.840> for

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
and I guess this is really good for

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.330 
and I guess this is really good for
mining<00:02:20.410> so<00:02:20.620> if<00:02:20.709> you're<00:02:20.830> going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:20.980> go<00:02:21.099> mining

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
mining so if you're going to go mining

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.910 
mining so if you're going to go mining
and<00:02:21.819> I<00:02:21.910> suggest<00:02:22.390> using<00:02:22.540> this<00:02:22.810> oh<00:02:23.019> yeah<00:02:23.620> okay<00:02:23.890> I

you<00:03:28.420> know<00:03:28.450> if<00:03:28.569> you<00:03:28.630> can<00:03:28.720> get<00:03:28.810> different<00:03:28.930> types

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
you know if you can get different types

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.020 
you know if you can get different types
maybe<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.620> randomizes<00:03:29.980> that<00:03:30.730> would<00:03:30.819> be<00:03:30.910> really

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.030 
maybe it randomizes that would be really

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:33.720 
maybe it randomizes that would be really
cool<00:03:31.230> the<00:03:32.230> next<00:03:32.590> one<00:03:32.829> which<00:03:33.069> in<00:03:33.310> my<00:03:33.400> opinion<00:03:33.519> is

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
cool the next one which in my opinion is

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.449 
cool the next one which in my opinion is
the<00:03:33.850> most<00:03:34.170> creative<00:03:35.170> and<00:03:35.560> most<00:03:35.769> fun<00:03:36.069> is<00:03:36.310> the

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
the most creative and most fun is the

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.129 
the most creative and most fun is the
instant<00:03:36.819> rainbow<00:03:37.090> skydive<00:03:37.510> block<00:03:37.840> and<00:03:38.079> you

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:38.139 
instant rainbow skydive block and you

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:39.420 
instant rainbow skydive block and you
hasn't<00:03:38.260> see<00:03:38.440> rainbow<00:03:38.769> is<00:03:38.889> felt<00:03:39.100> in<00:03:39.160> rainbow

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
hasn't see rainbow is felt in rainbow

right<00:05:37.170> here<00:05:37.200> and<00:05:37.620> just<00:05:37.920> the<00:05:38.760> water<00:05:38.970> because<00:05:39.360> of

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
right here and just the water because of

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.480 
right here and just the water because of
the<00:05:40.140> creative<00:05:40.470> world<00:05:40.620> and<00:05:40.950> messed<00:05:41.280> up<00:05:41.460> a

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
the creative world and messed up a

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.610 
the creative world and messed up a
little<00:05:41.790> but<00:05:42.750> if<00:05:42.840> it<00:05:42.930> was<00:05:43.020> in<00:05:43.080> a<00:05:43.140> normal<00:05:43.320> world

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
little but if it was in a normal world

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.470 
little but if it was in a normal world
the<00:05:43.920> water<00:05:44.070> would<00:05:44.220> simply<00:05:44.550> just<00:05:44.730> flow<00:05:45.030> to<00:05:45.450> that

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
the water would simply just flow to that

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:47.240 
the water would simply just flow to that
one<00:05:45.810> little<00:05:45.960> point<00:05:46.230> in<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.560> mobs<00:05:46.860> to<00:05:47.040> go<00:05:47.130> all

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:47.250 
one little point in the mobs to go all

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.860 
one little point in the mobs to go all
the<00:05:47.280> way<00:05:47.400> up<00:05:47.640> and<00:05:47.880> then<00:05:47.940> they<00:05:48.150> drop<00:05:48.540> to<00:05:48.780> their
