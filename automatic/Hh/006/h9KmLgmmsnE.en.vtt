that but I took the scene here you have
one<00:05:21.390> of<00:05:21.420> the<00:05:21.600> LEDs<00:05:22.020> and<00:05:22.350> the<00:05:22.590> other<00:05:22.710> LED<00:05:23.160> there

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
one of the LEDs and the other LED there

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.030 
one of the LEDs and the other LED there
that<00:05:23.550> picks<00:05:23.790> up<00:05:23.910> the<00:05:24.060> signals<00:05:24.530> from<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.620> unit

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
that picks up the signals from the unit

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:27.020 
that picks up the signals from the unit
inside<00:05:26.310> the<00:05:26.370> cabin

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
inside the cabin

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.830 
inside the cabin
I<00:05:27.620> do<00:05:28.620> use<00:05:28.980> lipo<00:05:29.730> batteries<00:05:30.210> on<00:05:30.360> these<00:05:30.510> trucks

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
I do use lipo batteries on these trucks

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.130

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:34.140 
this one has got a 10,000 milliamp this

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.960 
this one has got a 10,000 milliamp this
one<00:05:34.380> now<00:05:34.740> it's<00:05:35.040> got<00:05:35.220> a<00:05:35.250> six<00:05:35.550> thousand<00:05:35.940> milliamp

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
one now it's got a six thousand milliamp

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.040 
one now it's got a six thousand milliamp
well<00:05:38.970> that's<00:05:39.180> the<00:05:39.330> reason<00:05:39.540> I<00:05:39.600> want<00:05:39.750> to<00:05:39.810> build<00:05:39.960> a

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
well that's the reason I want to build a

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.390 
well that's the reason I want to build a

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
box on here for this one because it's

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.390 
box on here for this one because it's
quite<00:05:41.610> a<00:05:41.640> big<00:05:41.850> battery<00:05:42.920> magically<00:05:43.920> it<00:05:44.100> makes<00:05:44.280> a

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:44.400 
quite a big battery magically it makes a

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.760 
quite a big battery magically it makes a
lot<00:05:44.550> of<00:05:44.580> noise<00:05:44.700> this<00:05:45.230> because<00:05:46.230> I<00:05:46.380> have<00:05:46.530> got<00:05:46.740> a

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:46.770 
lot of noise this because I have got a

00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:49.730 
lot of noise this because I have got a
gear<00:05:47.280> box<00:05:47.480> sort<00:05:48.480> of<00:05:48.660> in<00:05:48.810> a<00:05:48.840> little<00:05:49.230> mini<00:05:49.530> gear

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
gear box sort of in a little mini gear

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:54.590 
gear box sort of in a little mini gear
box<00:05:50.870> that's<00:05:51.870> bringing<00:05:52.080> it<00:05:52.290> back<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:53.360> know<00:05:54.360> guys

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:54.600 
box that's bringing it back I know guys

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:57.890 
box that's bringing it back I know guys
will<00:05:55.020> stop<00:05:55.290> that<00:05:55.320> anyway<00:05:55.800> here<00:05:56.480> it<00:05:57.480> will<00:05:57.630> keep
