anything<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:14.750> sort<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.610> I<00:05:16.610> believe<00:05:16.880> he

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
anything of the sort and I believe he

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:24.420 
anything of the sort and I believe he
can<00:05:17.690> just<00:05:17.919> be<00:05:18.919> set<00:05:19.250> right<00:05:19.520> in<00:05:19.729> there<00:05:22.120> let's<00:05:23.120> see

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
can just be set right in there let's see

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.159 
can just be set right in there let's see
let<00:05:25.430> me<00:05:25.580> see<00:05:25.820> what<00:05:26.000> happens<00:05:26.090> here<00:05:28.990> see<00:05:29.990> should

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
let me see what happens here see should

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:32.110 
let me see what happens here see should
be<00:05:30.259> like<00:05:30.440> black<00:05:30.889> poem<00:05:31.190> so<00:05:31.789> I<00:05:31.820> guess<00:05:31.940> I<00:05:31.970> have

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:32.120 
be like black poem so I guess I have

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:35.649 
be like black poem so I guess I have
pushed<00:05:32.300> it<00:05:32.419> away<00:05:32.599> and<00:05:32.840> it<00:05:33.050> locks<00:05:33.320> in<00:05:33.590> okay<00:05:34.659> so

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:35.659 
pushed it away and it locks in okay so

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.629 
pushed it away and it locks in okay so
we're<00:05:35.990> just<00:05:36.020> gonna<00:05:36.199> have<00:05:36.440> him<00:05:36.620> fly<00:05:37.009> into<00:05:37.490> the

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:37.639 
we're just gonna have him fly into the

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:40.210 
we're just gonna have him fly into the
front<00:05:38.599> apart<00:05:38.900> they're<00:05:39.139> gonna<00:05:39.770> get<00:05:39.919> kind<00:05:40.130> of<00:05:40.190> a

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
front apart they're gonna get kind of a

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.850 
front apart they're gonna get kind of a
side<00:05:40.550> view<00:05:40.820> here<00:05:40.849> I<00:05:41.090> guess<00:05:41.500> if<00:05:42.500> have<00:05:42.650> you<00:05:42.740> had<00:05:42.830> a

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:44.509 
little bit of a better angle I'm gonna

00:05:44.509 --> 00:05:47.499 
little bit of a better angle I'm gonna
hold<00:05:44.810> the<00:05:44.960> back<00:05:45.139> as<00:05:45.349> well<00:05:45.560> so<00:05:46.400> we'll<00:05:47.120> pull<00:05:47.389> them

00:05:47.499 --> 00:05:47.509 
hold the back as well so we'll pull them

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.570

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:07.830 
the middle

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.559 
the middle
it<00:06:08.310> looks<00:06:08.460> like<00:06:08.580> it<00:06:08.699> should<00:06:08.729> have<00:06:09.360> a<00:06:09.419> way<00:06:09.539> of

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:09.569 
it looks like it should have a way of

00:06:09.569 --> 00:06:14.119 
it looks like it should have a way of
coming<00:06:09.840> apart<00:06:10.669> but<00:06:11.669> I<00:06:12.680> don't<00:06:13.680> want<00:06:13.800> to<00:06:13.889> fuss

00:06:14.119 --> 00:06:14.129 
coming apart but I don't want to fuss

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:15.589 
coming apart but I don't want to fuss
with<00:06:14.220> it<00:06:14.340> too<00:06:14.550> much<00:06:14.580> and<00:06:14.910> potentially<00:06:15.270> break

00:06:15.589 --> 00:06:15.599 
with it too much and potentially break

00:06:15.599 --> 00:06:16.070 
with it too much and potentially break
anything

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
anything

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:25.610 
anything
so<00:06:22.729> not<00:06:23.729> exactly<00:06:23.819> sure<00:06:24.300> but<00:06:24.690> if<00:06:25.259> you<00:06:25.409> push<00:06:25.590> that

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:25.620 
so not exactly sure but if you push that

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:28.909 
so not exactly sure but if you push that
down<00:06:25.949> once<00:06:26.460> it<00:06:26.669> hits<00:06:26.909> the<00:06:27.090> front<00:06:27.560> then<00:06:28.560> it<00:06:28.710> pops

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
down once it hits the front then it pops

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:32.029 
down once it hits the front then it pops
out<00:06:29.159> and<00:06:29.789> whoever's<00:06:30.330> driving<00:06:30.870> it<00:06:31.139> should<00:06:31.770> fly

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:32.039 
out and whoever's driving it should fly

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:40.450 
out and whoever's driving it should fly
out<00:06:38.539> already

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
out already

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.439 
out already
nice<00:06:41.460> Shing<00:06:41.880> make<00:06:42.180> it<00:06:42.300> fly<00:06:42.569> over<00:06:42.720> my<00:06:42.870> hand<00:06:43.110> here

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:44.449

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:47.270 
nice Shing make it fly over my hand here
so<00:06:45.449> yeah<00:06:45.630> if<00:06:46.139> you<00:06:46.199> guys<00:06:46.289> have<00:06:46.440> a<00:06:46.500> box<00:06:46.770> to<00:06:46.949> hit

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:47.280 
so yeah if you guys have a box to hit

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:49.010 
so yeah if you guys have a box to hit
right<00:06:47.819> in<00:06:47.940> front<00:06:48.090> of<00:06:48.180> them<00:06:48.300> you<00:06:48.539> can<00:06:48.810> fly

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:49.020 
right in front of them you can fly

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:50.839 
right in front of them you can fly
pretty<00:06:49.289> far<00:06:49.590> you<00:06:50.190> can<00:06:50.340> see<00:06:50.490> went<00:06:50.669> all<00:06:50.759> the<00:06:50.789> way

00:06:50.839 --> 00:06:50.849 
pretty far you can see went all the way

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.629 
pretty far you can see went all the way
over<00:06:51.270> there<00:06:51.389> so<00:06:51.780> flies<00:06:52.530> are<00:06:52.710> good<00:06:52.830> six<00:06:53.370> inches

00:06:53.629 --> 00:06:53.639 
over there so flies are good six inches

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:58.339 
over there so flies are good six inches
or<00:06:53.789> so<00:06:53.940> anyway<00:06:54.300> let<00:06:55.259> me<00:06:55.289> try<00:06:55.500> to<00:06:57.020> do<00:06:58.020> it<00:06:58.139> more

00:06:58.339 --> 00:06:58.349 
or so anyway let me try to do it more

00:06:58.349 --> 00:07:07.659 
or so anyway let me try to do it more
off<00:06:58.680> to<00:06:58.919> the<00:06:58.979> side<00:06:59.190> here<00:07:04.610> hit<00:07:05.610> my<00:07:05.759> thumb<00:07:06.050> but

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:07.669 
off to the side here hit my thumb but

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:09.800 
off to the side here hit my thumb but
you<00:07:08.669> have<00:07:08.759> to<00:07:08.849> pull<00:07:08.969> and<00:07:09.419> the<00:07:09.509> car<00:07:09.690> goes

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:09.810 
you have to pull and the car goes

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:11.570 
you have to pull and the car goes
farther<00:07:10.169> than<00:07:10.259> you<00:07:10.860> pull<00:07:11.039> back<00:07:11.250> so<00:07:11.430> I<00:07:11.490> just

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:11.580 
farther than you pull back so I just

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.719 
farther than you pull back so I just
pull<00:07:11.789> back<00:07:11.819> that<00:07:12.210> far<00:07:13.039> hey<00:07:14.039> if<00:07:14.520> there's<00:07:14.669> not

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:14.729 
pull back that far hey if there's not

00:07:14.729 --> 00:07:15.980 
pull back that far hey if there's not
stuff<00:07:14.880> to<00:07:15.030> stop<00:07:15.240> it<00:07:15.389> it's<00:07:15.509> gonna<00:07:15.599> drive<00:07:15.870> off

00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:15.990 
stuff to stop it it's gonna drive off

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:18.709 
stuff to stop it it's gonna drive off
the<00:07:16.169> table<00:07:16.500> so<00:07:16.800> it<00:07:17.789> can<00:07:17.940> go<00:07:18.030> pretty<00:07:18.240> far<00:07:18.479> to<00:07:18.539> pay

00:07:18.709 --> 00:07:18.719 
the table so it can go pretty far to pay

00:07:18.719 --> 00:07:20.330 
the table so it can go pretty far to pay
off<00:07:18.900> right<00:07:19.020> back<00:07:19.229> it<00:07:19.380> up<00:07:19.530> there's<00:07:19.800> place<00:07:19.979> some

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:20.340 
off right back it up there's place some

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:22.670 
off right back it up there's place some
sort<00:07:20.520> of<00:07:20.580> limit<00:07:20.819> to<00:07:21.000> it<00:07:21.120> but<00:07:21.440> these<00:07:22.440> have<00:07:22.650> a

00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:22.680 
sort of limit to it but these have a

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.050 
sort of limit to it but these have a
pretty<00:07:23.039> good<00:07:23.159> range<00:07:23.370> for<00:07:23.490> it<00:07:23.789> and<00:07:23.940> that's

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:24.060 
pretty good range for it and that's

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.510 
pretty good range for it and that's
still<00:07:24.449> again<00:07:25.319> it's<00:07:25.680> fully<00:07:25.889> customizable<00:07:26.069> if

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.520 
still again it's fully customizable if

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:29.300 
still again it's fully customizable if
you<00:07:26.580> buy<00:07:26.669> more<00:07:26.819> than<00:07:26.909> one<00:07:27.060> of<00:07:27.090> them<00:07:27.240> so<00:07:28.159> if<00:07:29.159> you

00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:29.310 
you buy more than one of them so if you

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:31.189 
you buy more than one of them so if you
got<00:07:29.490> creative<00:07:30.029> kids<00:07:30.270> or<00:07:30.479> your<00:07:30.690> kid<00:07:30.870> watching

you're creative enough to design things

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:36.140 
you're creative enough to design things
it's<00:07:33.990> not<00:07:34.139> very<00:07:34.380> complicated<00:07:34.770> but<00:07:35.069> yeah<00:07:36.060> if

00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.150
