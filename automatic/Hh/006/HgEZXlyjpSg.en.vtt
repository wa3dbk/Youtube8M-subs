00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:04.081
 By popular demand, Screen Junkies present 

00:00:04.081 --> 00:00:07.442
 honest trailer that may contain spoilers. 

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:13.203
 Meet the brand new sequel to restart the franchise, 

00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:16.644
 which is based on the sequel of the film from the original franchise. 

00:00:16.884 --> 00:00:19.205
 "STARRY WAY TO DARKNESS" 

00:00:19.445 --> 00:00:21.845
 Um, colon nobody forgot? 

00:00:22.005 --> 00:00:24.966
 Get ready for a sequel about which JJ Abrams swore 

00:00:24.966 --> 00:00:27.847
 that he won't be like Star Trek 2: Khan's Wrath. 

00:00:28.167 --> 00:00:29.527
 Well, except for this moment: 

00:00:29.527 --> 00:00:30.727
 "Most needs 

00:00:30.727 --> 00:00:32.488
 more important than minority needs. " 

00:00:32.488 --> 00:00:33.528
 And this 

00:00:33.928 --> 00:00:34.888
 And of course ... 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.009
 "HAAAN!" 

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:40.410
 "Haaan!" - this. 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.610
 But JJ is not only stealing scenes from Wrath of the Khan, 

00:00:43.771 --> 00:00:47.851
 he also re-uses everything that you liked in his Star Trek. 

00:00:48.092 --> 00:00:48.892
 For example: 

00:00:48.892 --> 00:00:50.652
 Kirk in bed with aliens 

00:00:50.652 --> 00:00:52.173
 Spock in fits of anger 

00:00:52.413 --> 00:00:54.093
 Kirk and Pike are drinking 

00:00:54.093 --> 00:00:55.853
 Red Bull jumps from space 

00:00:55.853 --> 00:00:57.294
 Running through the corridors 

00:00:57.294 --> 00:00:58.414
 Old Spock 

00:00:58.734 --> 00:00:59.614
 AND... 

00:00:59.614 --> 00:01:00.334
 EVEN 

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:01.535
 MORE 

00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:02.815
 BIN OF LENSES! 

00:01:11.857 --> 00:01:13.378
 Um, well, well, you understand. 

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:16.338
 So again ride with James T. Kirk, 

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:20.419
 the worst captain of Starfleet in the entire galaxy who 

00:01:20.419 --> 00:01:22.740
 defiles the gods of other civilizations 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.180
 "" What the hell are you saying? " 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.701
 "-I do not know, but they bowed to him!" 

00:01:25.861 --> 00:01:28.741
 lets experienced crew members out of malice 

00:01:28.741 --> 00:01:30.902
 "-So you accept my resignation or not?" 

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:31.862
 "-I accept!" 

00:01:31.862 --> 00:01:35.143
 Increases inexperienced crew members tucked under the arm 

00:01:35.143 --> 00:01:36.423
 "-Will be the chief engineer." 

00:01:36.423 --> 00:01:37.303
 "-I have, captain." 

00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:40.357
 And fails to protect his crew 

00:01:40.904 --> 00:01:42.185
 ... and the Enterprise 

00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:45.225
 ... and the center of San Francisco. 

00:01:47.946 --> 00:01:52.587
 Dejectedly watch the stereotypical image of the two main female characters: 

00:01:52.587 --> 00:01:56.908
 Uhura, usually a competent officer, interrupts a deadly mission, 

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:58.668
 to grumble at your boyfriend. 

00:01:58.668 --> 00:02:01.229
 "You prefer not to discuss your feelings at all." 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.749
 "Could you discuss it later?" 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.270
 "-And never pay your undivided attention ... Sorry, Captain, a couple of seconds." 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.751
 And newcomer Carol Marcus, who is in the film for the sole reason 

00:02:11.071 --> 00:02:12.032
 "Turn away." 

00:02:12.272 --> 00:02:13.792
 We count as two reasons. 

00:02:14.032 --> 00:02:18.113
 See how this crew is confronted by their most dangerous adversary: 

00:02:18.113 --> 00:02:19.153
 "Han!" 

00:02:19.153 --> 00:02:20.674
 This is a ruthless villain. 

00:02:20.674 --> 00:02:22.194
 "So, let's start?" 

00:02:22.194 --> 00:02:24.515
 He is so inhuman that ... 

00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:25.795
 won't kill Spock 

00:02:26.835 --> 00:02:29.236
 allow Kirk to express his feelings 

00:02:30.676 --> 00:02:34.357
 and ultimately it will be completely justified in their actions: 

00:02:34.357 --> 00:02:36.838
 "My crew is my family." 

00:02:36.838 --> 00:02:40.679
 "Wouldn't you have done anything for your family?" 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:42.679
 Admittedly, the argument is strong. 

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:47.960
 So feel free to go to this ridiculous temporary branch of "Star Trek", in which: 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.121
 "Enterprise" withstands more hits than he took for the entire original series 

00:02:52.121 --> 00:02:56.522
 Against the backdrop of magical interplanetary transporters spacecraft seem antiquity 

00:02:56.522 --> 00:02:58.923
 Death is cured by magical super blood. 

00:02:58.923 --> 00:03:01.724
 "I synthesized a serum from his super blood." 

00:03:01.724 --> 00:03:06.445
 And whenever they fall into a space jam, the old Spock webcam file 

00:03:06.445 --> 00:03:08.765
 "- Mr. Spock. - Mr. Spock." 

00:03:08.765 --> 00:03:12.126
 Oh, I already imagine what the next Star Trek will be. 

00:03:13.486 --> 00:03:18.928
 "Klingon General Cheng, Horta, Tolians, Borg. ALL VERY BAD !!!" 

00:03:18.928 --> 00:03:20.928
 Who else should we beware of? 

00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:22.449
 Did we go through Gorn? 

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.409
 Yes. This is just a test. The horn does not kill. 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.651
 Right. Oh, and when you return to New York in the 1930s, you must kill the girl Kirk, 

00:03:31.651 --> 00:03:34.531
 otherwise, Hitler will win World War II. 

00:03:34.531 --> 00:03:35.652
 How interesting. 

00:03:35.652 --> 00:03:41.413
 Oh, and at the same time hunt down a pair of humpback whales: this will save you a lot of time later. 

00:03:41.413 --> 00:03:42.934
 Gory-baty Ki-you. 

00:03:42.934 --> 00:03:47.175
 Well, sort of, that's all. And now, I believe you have something for me. 

00:03:47.815 --> 00:03:49.095
 A NEW MESSAGE! 

00:03:50.615 --> 00:03:52.296
 Oh you are lucky! 

00:03:52.296 --> 00:03:56.617
 The best I got was that weird dance in Star Trek 5. 

00:03:56.617 --> 00:04:00.458
 Will we definitely not break any space-time continuum? 

00:04:00.458 --> 00:04:03.018
 Hey! Do you want me to help, or not ?! 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:04.699
 CAST... 

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:06.219
 CAPTAIN FURK 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.099
 SCOOP 

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:08.540
 OLD SOVOK 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:10.060
 MARGARET CHO 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.580
 CARLOS SANTANA 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.141
 DOCTOR, NOT A MIRACLE 

00:04:14.301 --> 00:04:15.581
 Blingo 

00:04:15.581 --> 00:04:17.182
 SCOTT NAME ENGINEER 

00:04:17.502 --> 00:04:18.462
 Robokop 

00:04:18.782 --> 00:04:19.902
 FRAME TO SCREEN 

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:22.463
 AND BENEDICT CAMBERBAND EGGS 

00:04:22.623 --> 00:04:25.504
 "STARRY WAY TO DARKNESS" 

00:04:25.504 --> 00:04:28.064
 Let's definitely not put a colon? 

00:04:28.945 --> 00:04:31.665

 "I am a charming-adorable princess." 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.191
 "Nadu ass, Cbass!" 

00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.871
 "Go quiet." 

00:04:57.351 --> 00:04:58.896
 "Haaan!"
