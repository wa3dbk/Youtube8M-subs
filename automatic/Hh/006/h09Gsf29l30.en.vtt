one<00:04:28.729> thing<00:04:28.939> i<00:04:29.120> don't<00:04:29.180> like<00:04:29.539> about<00:04:29.930> this<00:04:30.499> is

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
one thing i don't like about this is

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.279 
one thing i don't like about this is
that<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:31.219> do<00:04:31.520> have<00:04:31.759> to<00:04:31.999> spread<00:04:32.330> it<00:04:32.479> evenly<00:04:32.599> to

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:33.289 
that you do have to spread it evenly to

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:36.330 
that you do have to spread it evenly to
not<00:04:33.469> get<00:04:33.620> any<00:04:33.830> splotze<00:04:34.340> like<00:04:35.300> uneven<00:04:35.539> tanning

not get any splotze like uneven tanning

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.950 
not get any splotze like uneven tanning
so<00:04:37.340> that<00:04:37.490> takes<00:04:37.639> up<00:04:37.849> a<00:04:37.939> lot<00:04:38.120> of<00:04:38.150> time<00:04:38.449> and<00:04:38.659> too

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
so that takes up a lot of time and too

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.860 
so that takes up a lot of time and too
I'm<00:04:39.349> not<00:04:39.620> too<00:04:39.800> fond<00:04:40.039> of<00:04:40.189> smell<00:04:41.090> so<00:04:41.419> definitely
