00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:15.760
 nine months of his government and with 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:18.640
 reason for the political message of his first 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.869
 government report peÃ±a grandson does not have 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.140
 nothing to brag about there are no happy accounts 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:29.189
 than to offer Mexican society the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:32.080
 maintenance of the neoliberal scheme 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.410
 economic in our country has thrown 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:39.460
 more than a growth a decrease 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:43.480
 a virtual stagnation of 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.579
 economy and of course the absence of 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:49.059
 enough jobs we are located 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:52.930
 at the worst level of unemployment in the 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:56.129
 last years and also what we saw today 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:58.920
 in the official residence of the pines 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:02.050
 is far from being a republican act 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.440
 rather it is the return to the old 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:08.080
 self- praise ways how good that 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.170
 recognizes that the only achievements 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.409
 important are those that have derived from 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.760
 agreements like reforms 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.250
 very important 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.370
 the result of the work of the pact by 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:24.090
 mexico in which the pr participates with 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.290
 a lot of responsibility we 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:31.670
 we will continue to demand 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.100
 take back the roads that can take 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:39.850
 that this country and that this government 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.710
 and assume that you can not continue with this 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:44.680
 model of economic development that is 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.360
 a factory that produces millions and 

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.610
 million poor people every year and that does not give 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:53.530
 the opportunities for the development of 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.960
 new generations that we follow 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:59.530
 stagnant in virtually all 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.140
 included items of insecurity in the 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.869
 whole country especially in regions 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.869
 very important of our country 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.600
 we will continue insisting from the 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:13.840
 pr of still participating in the pact for 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.709
 Mexico that a reform is required 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.560
 deep energy but that should not 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:23.019
 modify you do not need to modify the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.410
 constitution in none of your articles 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:28.299
 neither in 27 nor in 28 and that 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.790
 we also require a reform 

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.920
 progressive finance to pay 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.739
 more the ones who earn the most is to say one 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.250
 progressive tax reform that puts 

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:41.650
 in the center the need for a 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.080
 solidarity distribution with the whole 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.840
 of the country to attack the huge 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:50.830
 remnants and lags that we have we are not going 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:53.950
 to allow the nation to be removed 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.739
 absolute ownership over 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:59.230
 hydrocarbons we will not allow the 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.819
 delivery to private hands of wealth 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.580
 of our country with that determination 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.069
 we will continue working and therefore 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.860
 do not go thinking that because we are 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:12.250
 in the room for mexico we are going to say 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.290
 yes to everything that means that it comes from 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.550
 there is as a proposal of the grandson of the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.060
 pri 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:22.920
 but we're going to say yes to all that 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.920
 that we agree for the good of the country
