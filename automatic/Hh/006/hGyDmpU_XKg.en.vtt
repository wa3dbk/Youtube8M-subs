00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
it seems as if the PlayStation 4 launch

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.279 
it seems as if the PlayStation 4 launch
has<00:00:14.610> gone<00:00:14.849> off<00:00:15.059> without<00:00:15.240> a<00:00:15.450> hitch<00:00:15.750> we're<00:00:16.020> close

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
has gone off without a hitch we're close

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.130 
has gone off without a hitch we're close
to<00:00:16.529> 24<00:00:17.160> hours<00:00:17.520> in<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.539> seems<00:00:18.840> like

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
to 24 hours in and it seems like

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
to 24 hours in and it seems like
everything's<00:00:19.680> good<00:00:19.920> and<00:00:19.949> there<00:00:20.550> aren't<00:00:20.760> any

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
everything's good and there aren't any

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.150 
everything's good and there aren't any
issues<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.720> for<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.050> majority<00:00:22.590> of<00:00:22.619> people

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
issues and for the majority of people

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.730 
issues and for the majority of people
that<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.730> true<00:00:24.119> I<00:00:24.150> think<00:00:24.689> but<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.500> look

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
that is true I think but if you look

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.800 
that is true I think but if you look
hard<00:00:25.980> enough<00:00:26.130> there<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.670> some<00:00:27.269> issues<00:00:27.449> going

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
hard enough there are some issues going

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
hard enough there are some issues going
on<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> them<00:00:28.920> are<00:00:29.070> pretty<00:00:29.400> crazy

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
on and some of them are pretty crazy

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.330 
on and some of them are pretty crazy
there's<00:00:30.390> reports<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.080> more<00:00:31.380> brick<00:00:31.679> consoles

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
there's reports of more brick consoles

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.729 
there's reports of more brick consoles
and<00:00:32.610> obviously<00:00:33.450> you're<00:00:33.750> going<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.110> expect<00:00:34.620> to

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
and obviously you're going to expect to

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
and obviously you're going to expect to
have<00:00:34.980> a<00:00:35.190> certain<00:00:35.460> amount<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:36.090> bricked

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
have a certain amount of bricked

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.889 
have a certain amount of bricked
consoles<00:00:36.989> so<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.800> is<00:00:38.040> not<00:00:38.309> all<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.090> crazy<00:00:39.570> I

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
consoles so that is not all that crazy I

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.990 
consoles so that is not all that crazy I
guess<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.469> we<00:00:40.950> really<00:00:41.309> don't<00:00:41.520> know<00:00:41.790> the

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
guess and we really don't know the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440 
guess and we really don't know the
numbers<00:00:42.390> at<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.960> point<00:00:43.410> so<00:00:44.450> speculating

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
numbers at this point so speculating

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.900 
numbers at this point so speculating
that<00:00:45.480> it's<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.350> huge<00:00:46.770> failure<00:00:47.250> rate<00:00:47.670> or

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that it's a huge failure rate or

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
that it's a huge failure rate or
anything<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.510> would<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:49.110> stupid

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
anything like that would just be stupid

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.639 
anything like that would just be stupid
but<00:00:50.520> I<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:50.700> want<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.120> point<00:00:51.300> out<00:00:51.480> another<00:00:52.079> issue

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
but I do want to point out another issue

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.430 
but I do want to point out another issue

one<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.400> comments<00:01:17.850> said<00:01:18.090> I'm<00:01:18.299> having<00:01:18.810> this

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
one of the comments said I'm having this

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.710 
one of the comments said I'm having this
problem<00:01:19.470> with<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.920> ps4<00:01:20.280> as<00:01:20.640> well<00:01:20.880> tried

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
problem with my ps4 as well tried

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.570 
problem with my ps4 as well tried
leaving<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.170> unplugged<00:01:22.350> for<00:01:22.830> 30<00:01:23.070> minutes<00:01:23.310> but

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
leaving it unplugged for 30 minutes but

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.420 
leaving it unplugged for 30 minutes but
the<00:01:23.670> problem<00:01:24.060> came<00:01:24.270> back<00:01:24.540> this<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.590> not<00:01:25.950> good

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
the problem came back this is not good

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.940 
the problem came back this is not good
then<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.240> guess<00:01:27.689> his<00:01:27.869> video<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.409> getting<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.740> lot

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
then I guess his video is getting a lot

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.640 
then I guess his video is getting a lot
