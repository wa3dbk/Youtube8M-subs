00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:27.440 

I'm<00:03:23.310> sure<00:03:23.640> those<00:03:23.850> whiskers<00:03:24.150> will<00:03:24.540> go<00:03:24.750> back<00:03:26.450> and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
I'm sure those whiskers will go back and

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.180 
I'm sure those whiskers will go back and
it's<00:03:27.600> funny<00:03:27.810> because<00:03:27.900> his<00:03:28.380> whiskers<00:03:28.920> are

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
it's funny because his whiskers are

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.510 
it's funny because his whiskers are
black<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.180> turned<00:03:30.570> to<00:03:30.690> white<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:32.100> was<00:03:32.250> just

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
black and turned to white and I was just

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.520 
black and turned to white and I was just
noticing<00:03:32.880> that<00:03:33.180> Mariah's<00:03:33.720> whiskers<00:03:34.260> are

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
noticing that Mariah's whiskers are

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.770 
noticing that Mariah's whiskers are
white<00:03:35.520> and<00:03:35.850> turned<00:03:36.150> to<00:03:36.270> black<00:03:36.540> on<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:36.900> ends

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:38.780 
white and turned to black on the ends

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:51.360 
white and turned to black on the ends
