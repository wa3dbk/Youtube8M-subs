00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.959
 good time of ravines I come to you 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.510
 introduce my friends lecchini and it will be 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.460
 an ideal string door for 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.850
 transport our rope have it well 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:22.490
 organized and our short backpack 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:25.310
 material for ropes for our boat 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.990
 tight or whatever we want 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.330
 I think it's probably the best 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.390
 set of ravine material that 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.820
 I found but because we're going to 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.649
 tell the first thing you have to have 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.949
 in account the good things are done 

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.120
 with good material and this is a material 

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.640
 tremendously tenacious tremendously 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.460
 resistant and tremendously resistant to 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.469
 the abrasion that is frankly 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.879
 interesting in the world of the ravine 

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:52.789
 It has very interesting details 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.620
 example this drilling system in 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.199
 circle shape is a system 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.019
 developed by these people the idea 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.440
 basically it's very easy to evacuate 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.640
 the water but that is tremendously 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.430
 resistant indeed tests have been made 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.440
 destructive tensile tests on 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.450
 these holes putting a carabiner and 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.820
 pulling it and gives some ratios of 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.220
 resistance frankly 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.070
 pÃ©rez before we go to summarize is 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.430
 indestructible but more things have a few 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:26.150
 holes as you can see pierced with 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:29.510
 some pieces made of metal this metal 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.729
 it's stainless steel is a metal that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.759
 obviously does not react with the bow in 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.759
 the water therefore can not oxidize 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:41.000
 and therefore it will make it last a lot 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.090
 your material but what else has a 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.030
 backpack like this is for example mounts 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.340
 a pocket on the top that 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.979
 is communicated with the inner part to 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.300
 through a communicated network 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.369
 to see if you understand me the idea 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:58.910
 basically it is that when it comes from 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:01.369
 water evacuate quickly is a pocket 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.050
 to put small things those things 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.899
 small we do not want us 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.759
 lose and having more details on hand 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.220
 of the backpack as the backpack as 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.350
 you can see mounts very long straps 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.530
 so that the lid can be very 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.940
 open when we have it very loaded 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.130
 normally in approximation is when 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.330
 We wear our neoprene inside our 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.790
 bounce our rope 

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.620
 and the long side etcetera of material that 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.930
 we need but then we do not have the 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.320
 need that this one of this rope 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.990
 to this file this strip is smaller 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.750
 how do they do it good incorporate this 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:39.170
 and incorporate this rubber that you after 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.030
 you can relegate accordingly and how can you 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:46.310
 see you can leave as you 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 You also want to wear a sewn strip 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.440
 very very generously so that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.210
 it is impossible to tear it to be able 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.080
 pass it to our colleagues or 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.660
 companions but more details of the 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.730
 backpack because it has a few 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:03.400
 backpack padded back padded 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.650
 I wanted to say 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.230
 padded not with anything 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.840
 padded with a material that gives 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.360
 buoyancy the idea is basically that 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.030
 when this backpack we leave it on a 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:19.239
 hen we do not sink and so the 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.280
 we can lose to refloat more agreement 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.299
 details but for the other details 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.609
 I better put it on, come on, you have this 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.980
 backpack then it has so that you do 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:33.459
 an idea two pricks to take it 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:37.090
 hung with his tridents for 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:40.780
 free us in case you get caught 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.209
 both one and the other the idea is that a 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.359
 pam trident let go through the 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.639
 backpack we are liberated we have space and 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.709
 we can go through the place where we 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:53.230
 we have been trapped as they are also 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.599
 backpacks of 40 liters and in 40 liters already 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.939
 you can take enough material and for 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:04:00.430
 so much weight we have a 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:02.680
 Very generous fanny pack very with very 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.900
 comfortable that fits very well on the 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.569
 body the idea is that we load on 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.490
 lumbar and not on back is that 

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.560
 when we leave our 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.470
 the full of water we can evacuate 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.860
 easily and not to load or back 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.190
 and lumbar over streets as you can 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.830
 see takes a few strips of agreement are 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.570
 a material holder can therefore serve to 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.540
 take our razor at a given moment 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.450
 or can it serve to carry our in 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.130
 this mini yuma fist case and you know that 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.870
 It is very good to be able to recover ropes 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.450
 which you will see in which wide eye to which 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:40.420
 is this here because sometimes when you jump 

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.730
 you know you can give a good blow 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:46.570
 therefore careful agreement 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:49.660
 details more details what happens with 

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:51.460
 our backpack carries ropes as it is 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.190
 a rope carrier with release 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:56.200
 quick water where we would take our 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.849
 rope in our inner part and in the 

00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:01.599
 part 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:04.569
 of our lumbar area there are some hoops 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:06.909
 metallic both on the left so much to 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.749
 the left as on the right serves 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:13.029
 so we can hang up because our 

00:05:09.749 --> 00:05:16.270
 backpack to see if I can do it already this 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:18.550
 It is a bag carrying material rope holder 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.800
 sorry we can take it hanging from 

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:23.050
 harness our backpack and it serves us 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.429
 to pull out our rope so 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:31.300
 comfortable to pass it by our carabiner in 

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:34.719
 the zone of the cinch and go winding 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:36.309
 our companion comfortably up 

00:05:34.719 --> 00:05:39.099
 find half of the rope for 

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:41.469
 then pull the other side and have them 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:45.300
 perfectly balanced and well 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:47.360
 collected according to nothing else 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.280
 a backpack with a lot of details 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.370
 probably the best bag set 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.039
 and backpack for the descent of canyons 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:59.780
 both for its durability so much for its 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:02.040
 design as well as that by the end 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:04.080
 finishes 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.820
 and nothing else the truth that I can not tell 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.820
 we just see each other and until another
