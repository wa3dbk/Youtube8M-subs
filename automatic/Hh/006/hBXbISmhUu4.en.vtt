00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:53.670 

next<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.180> just<00:01:52.509> back<00:01:52.750> up<00:01:52.960> the<00:01:53.079> record<00:01:53.439> and

next is just back up the record and

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.800 
next is just back up the record and
hopefully<00:01:54.460> get<00:01:54.640> going<00:01:54.969> a<00:01:55.090> little<00:01:55.210> bit<00:01:55.360> faster

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
hopefully get going a little bit faster

right<00:01:56.289> now<00:01:56.409> we're<00:01:56.590> the<00:01:56.619> fastest

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:58.869 
piston-engined so we're going to keep
