00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.870
 playing a lot with toco shoes 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.430
 a particular and then replace 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.800
 market in a in a party how do you 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.360
 you felt good well the truth that very 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.189
 comfortable because I had been doing neither 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.619
 playing already having the rhythm in reserve 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:21.089
 Thank God it helped me a lot to 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.699
 that was split with lanús and good 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.560
 later I had to enter with san juan and 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.909
 I agree with the yields that three 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.579
 cars tournaments taking into account that 

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:32.279
 maybe I expected more games and the going of 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.560
 a technician than the last say 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.090
 it did not take you into account too much 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.000
 beyond that circumstance that 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.410
 many matías game is also never 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.719
 good and a technician because he wants to say 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.879
 they are not dating things but 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:49.920
 well do not take for me it was all positive 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.629
 recent first in the edition the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.359
 year within balance of what was the 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:56.160
 rise and I think nothing overshadow the great 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.769
 damage we had and Ramón Díaz in this 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.839
 little time it costs to know of no 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.100
 There will be much explained to them is tactically 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.960
 Yes Yes 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.159
 obviously that some some changes 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.310
 tactical 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.590
 and I am for example with the theme that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.259
 game with a hook but then good 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.539
 different points and in all in 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:17.250
 all situations and with respect to 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.329
 what is the not a person always that 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.789
 There is a lot of talk with the players 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.429
 we have a lot of dialogue and he 's a technician 

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:25.740
 very simple in mind that at the beginning 

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.020
 championship hesitated to stay or be 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
 I doubted sciences you stayed or not today 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.759
 you stay and want to lose a position and which 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.520
 is the group goal day surely 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.860
 today I stay I want to always stay my 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.129
 I wanted to stay in really nobody was 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.640
 wants to go but to a club that where 

00:01:41.129 --> 00:01:44.920
 can do 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.450
 better as soon as a load that is in 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.430
 europe in america I think the best is 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.630
 footballingly speaking but and in 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:56.860
 As for the good group we hope 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.660
 We aim to make doing champions because 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:00.660
 where it has to be 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.000
 and came a benefit party ended 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.910
 the year doing things for us 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.430
 Let's say it's the second time I've been here 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.130
 Past also I also came wait for me 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.840
 bighead also comes and good the truth 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.850
 that is good is good because 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.040
 it also serves beyond what the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.050
 solidarity to collaborate continues for 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.630
 get together with the guys that we have the 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.610
 true a very good relationship 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.290

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.400
