fighting anymore I don't know that he

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.560 
fighting anymore I don't know that he
was<00:01:05.280> fighting<00:01:05.489> confidence-wise<00:01:06.119> I'm<00:01:06.450> not

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
was fighting confidence-wise I'm not

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.240 
was fighting confidence-wise I'm not
sure<00:01:06.689> about<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.110> do<00:01:07.409> think<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.890> increased

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
sure about that I do think the increased

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
sure about that I do think the increased
reps<00:01:08.490> help<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.420> tonight<00:01:10.260> he<00:01:10.350> had<00:01:10.470> some<00:01:10.619> snaps

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
reps help and tonight he had some snaps

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.380 
reps help and tonight he had some snaps
with<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.010> first<00:01:11.250> offense<00:01:11.700> I<00:01:11.850> think<00:01:12.180> when<00:01:12.299> you

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
with the first offense I think when you

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.760 
with the first offense I think when you
with<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.659> first<00:01:12.869> group<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.260> it's<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.590> little

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
with the first group it's it's a little

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.810 
with the first group it's it's a little
bit<00:01:13.860> cleaner<00:01:14.100> usually<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> think<00:01:14.700> that

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
bit cleaner usually so I think that

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.120 
bit cleaner usually so I think that
hopes<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.200> what<00:01:16.200> did<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.590> overall<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
hopes to what did you think overall of

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.609 
hopes to what did you think overall of
the<00:01:17.250> cornerback<00:01:17.970> club<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.479> have<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.259> look<00:01:19.380> at<00:01:19.530> it

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the cornerback club I have to look at it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.350

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
looking at it in a big picture sense I
think<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.950> got<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.100> look<00:01:29.220> at<00:01:29.340> each<00:01:29.369> individual

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
think we got a look at each individual

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:30.980 
think we got a look at each individual
and<00:01:30.090> see<00:01:30.180> how<00:01:30.240> they<00:01:30.360> played<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.600> make<00:01:30.810> sure<00:01:30.900> we

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and see how they played and make sure we

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.149 
and see how they played and make sure we
got<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.170> best<00:01:31.290> players<00:01:31.500> on<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.710> field<00:01:31.829> how

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
got the best players on the field how

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.679 
got the best players on the field how

of him I wasn't watching and I was

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.499 
of him I wasn't watching and I was
behind<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.490> offense<00:01:35.850> for<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.030> most<00:01:36.210> parts

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
behind the offense for the most parts

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:37.969 
behind the offense for the most parts
are<00:01:36.630> really<00:01:36.840> tough<00:01:36.990> for<00:01:37.049> me<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.350> evaluate<00:01:37.860> it

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979

are really tough for me to evaluate it
you<00:01:38.070> know<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.189> real<00:01:38.520> i<00:01:38.610> think<00:01:38.640> that<00:01:38.970> one<00:01:39.090> I'd

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
you know I real i think that one I'd

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.780 
you know I real i think that one I'd
rather<00:01:39.450> reserve<00:01:39.780> comment<00:01:39.990> on<00:01:40.200> how<00:01:40.860> would<00:01:41.040> what

was it like you to see Paul Jenks break

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.470 
was it like you to see Paul Jenks break

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
situation like that before yeah I think

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.840 
situation like that before yeah I think
it's<00:01:49.070> a<00:01:49.160> great<00:01:49.760> reminder<00:01:50.480> of<00:01:50.900> what<00:01:51.520> of<00:01:52.520> what<00:01:52.610> he

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
it's a great reminder of what of what he

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.210 
it's a great reminder of what of what he
is<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:53.450> he's<00:01:53.780> a<00:01:53.810> he's<00:01:54.290> a<00:01:54.320> big<00:01:54.590> back<00:01:54.770> but<00:01:54.980> he<00:01:55.070> can

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
is and he's a he's a big back but he can

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.350 
is and he's a he's a big back but he can
run<00:01:55.400> and<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.760> would<00:01:55.850> have<00:01:55.940> been<00:01:56.000> nice<00:01:56.150> if<00:01:56.180> he

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
run and it would have been nice if he

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:57.910 
run and it would have been nice if he
got<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.570> the<00:01:56.630> end<00:01:56.750> zone<00:01:56.840> but<00:01:57.110> the<00:01:57.530> reality<00:01:57.890> is

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
got in the end zone but the reality is

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.080

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
definitely a teachable moment the

how<00:02:18.740> did<00:02:18.920> you<00:02:19.070> look<00:02:19.190> at<00:02:19.340> it<00:02:19.460> I<00:02:20.450> think<00:02:20.960> that's<00:02:21.140> an

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
how did you look at it I think that's an

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:22.690 
how did you look at it I think that's an
important<00:02:21.650> part<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.830> training<00:02:22.010> camp<00:02:22.250> I<00:02:22.400> think

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
important part of training camp I think

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730 
important part of training camp I think
sometimes<00:02:23.050> whether<00:02:24.050> they're<00:02:24.260> sitting<00:02:24.500> Alex

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
sometimes whether they're sitting Alex

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.680 
sometimes whether they're sitting Alex
are<00:02:24.800> a<00:02:24.860> little<00:02:24.950> dinged<00:02:25.190> up<00:02:25.310> or<00:02:25.610> you<00:02:26.270> put<00:02:26.450> a<00:02:26.510> guy

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
are a little dinged up or you put a guy

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.820 
are a little dinged up or you put a guy
who's<00:02:26.870> with<00:02:27.080> the<00:02:27.170> twos<00:02:27.350> in<00:02:27.380> there<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:27.740> the

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
who's with the twos in there with the

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.710 
who's with the twos in there with the
ones<00:02:28.070> and<00:02:28.610> even<00:02:28.910> tonight<00:02:29.210> we<00:02:29.390> did<00:02:29.510> a<00:02:29.570> lot<00:02:29.690> of

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
ones and even tonight we did a lot of

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.930 
ones and even tonight we did a lot of
ones<00:02:29.960> verse<00:02:30.170> tues<00:02:30.440> I<00:02:30.830> think<00:02:31.520> it's<00:02:31.640> important

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
ones verse tues I think it's important

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.130 
ones verse tues I think it's important
that<00:02:32.060> you<00:02:32.090> see<00:02:32.270> how<00:02:32.390> those<00:02:32.510> those<00:02:32.840> players

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
that you see how those those players

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.810 
that you see how those those players
react<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.860> know<00:02:33.950> because<00:02:34.160> those<00:02:34.340> backups

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
react you know because those backups

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.770 
react you know because those backups
when<00:02:34.970> they<00:02:35.060> go<00:02:35.180> in<00:02:35.300> the<00:02:35.390> game<00:02:35.540> they're

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
when they go in the game they're

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.600 
when they go in the game they're
responsible<00:02:36.260> to<00:02:36.410> be<00:02:36.500> the<00:02:36.620> starter<00:02:36.980> and

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
responsible to be the starter and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.130 
responsible to be the starter and
they're<00:02:37.790> surrounded<00:02:38.240> by<00:02:38.270> starters<00:02:38.750> so<00:02:38.900> it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
they're surrounded by starters so it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.720 
they're surrounded by starters so it
gives<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:39.440> a<00:02:39.470> great<00:02:39.620> gauge<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.250> think<00:02:40.460> of<00:02:40.550> where

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
gives you a great gauge I think of where

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.430 
gives you a great gauge I think of where
some<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:40.940> those<00:02:41.030> playing<00:02:41.300> out<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.660> guy<00:02:41.930> like<00:02:42.110> LJ

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
some of those playing out a guy like LJ

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:43.150 
some of those playing out a guy like LJ
listen<00:02:42.740> we're<00:02:42.830> gonna<00:02:42.920> have<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.070> great

Sebastian Joseph because from my vent by

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.449 
Sebastian Joseph because from my vent by
my<00:02:47.810> vantage<00:02:48.080> point<00:02:48.230> I<00:02:48.560> thought<00:02:49.220> he<00:02:49.340> had<00:02:49.430> a

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
my vantage point I thought he had a

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.620 
my vantage point I thought he had a
really<00:02:49.640> nice<00:02:49.790> scrimmage<00:02:50.120> tonight<00:02:50.240> now<00:02:50.480> we'll

really nice scrimmage tonight now we'll

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.790 
really nice scrimmage tonight now we'll
see<00:02:50.750> if<00:02:50.840> they<00:02:50.930> see<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.260> I'm<00:02:51.350> correct<00:02:51.500> and<00:02:51.740> we

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
see if they see if I'm correct and we

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.540 
see if they see if I'm correct and we
look<00:02:51.950> at<00:02:52.070> it<00:02:53.560> becoming<00:02:54.560> more<00:02:54.740> kisses<00:02:55.040> Peggy

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
look at it becoming more kisses Peggy

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.850 
look at it becoming more kisses Peggy
those<00:02:55.760> who<00:02:55.880> yeah<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:57.140> know<00:02:57.260> I<00:02:57.290> think<00:02:57.560> that's

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
those who yeah you know I think that's

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.340 
those who yeah you know I think that's
the<00:02:57.950> key<00:02:58.160> word<00:02:58.390> tonight<00:02:59.390> he<00:02:59.570> was<00:02:59.720> consistent

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the key word tonight he was consistent

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.770 
the key word tonight he was consistent
now<00:03:00.550> on<00:03:01.550> Monday<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.150> we<00:03:02.270> come<00:03:02.420> back<00:03:02.510> he's<00:03:02.660> got

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
now on Monday and we come back he's got

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.090 
now on Monday and we come back he's got
to<00:03:02.870> be<00:03:02.930> consistent<00:03:03.050> I<00:03:03.500> think<00:03:03.800> that's<00:03:03.950> the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
to be consistent I think that's the

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.190 
to be consistent I think that's the
important<00:03:04.459> thing<00:03:04.489> it's<00:03:04.760> not<00:03:04.820> so<00:03:05.209> much<00:03:05.270> doing

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
important thing it's not so much doing

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.960 
important thing it's not so much doing
it<00:03:06.380> one<00:03:06.590> night<00:03:06.620> it's<00:03:07.100> doing<00:03:07.340> it<00:03:07.459> day<00:03:07.610> after<00:03:07.820> day

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
it one night it's doing it day after day

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.729 
it one night it's doing it day after day
after<00:03:08.209> days<00:03:08.480> but<00:03:08.720> I'm<00:03:08.810> excited<00:03:09.260> about<00:03:09.530> what<00:03:09.680> he

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
after days but I'm excited about what he

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.220 
after days but I'm excited about what he
did<00:03:09.860> tonight<00:03:10.010> two<00:03:10.820> men<00:03:11.000> with<00:03:11.209> had<00:03:11.900> too<00:03:12.110> many

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
did tonight two men with had too many

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.150 
did tonight two men with had too many
big

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
big

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.720 
big
I<00:03:14.320> think<00:03:15.320> for<00:03:15.440> every<00:03:15.620> positive<00:03:15.830> you<00:03:16.220> can<00:03:16.460> look

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:16.730 
I think for every positive you can look

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.040 
I think for every positive you can look
at<00:03:16.850> it<00:03:16.910> in<00:03:17.030> a<00:03:17.120> positive<00:03:17.300> or<00:03:17.630> you<00:03:17.720> can<00:03:17.840> look<00:03:17.960> at

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
at it in a positive or you can look at

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.960 
at it in a positive or you can look at
it<00:03:18.080> as<00:03:18.260> a<00:03:18.290> negative<00:03:18.380> and<00:03:18.890> I<00:03:18.950> think<00:03:19.250> you<00:03:19.940> know

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
it as a negative and I think you know

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.700 
it as a negative and I think you know
part<00:03:20.360> of<00:03:20.450> what<00:03:20.600> we're<00:03:20.750> doing<00:03:20.990> right<00:03:21.110> now<00:03:21.170> with

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:21.710 
part of what we're doing right now with

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:23.350 
part of what we're doing right now with
everybody<00:03:22.340> playing<00:03:22.760> is<00:03:22.970> we're<00:03:23.120> getting<00:03:23.330> a

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
everybody playing is we're getting a

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.510 
everybody playing is we're getting a
little<00:03:23.480> bit<00:03:23.690> of<00:03:23.750> an<00:03:23.840> idea<00:03:23.990> of<00:03:24.340> where<00:03:25.340> we're<00:03:25.490> at

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:25.520 
little bit of an idea of where we're at

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:27.880 
little bit of an idea of where we're at
you<00:03:25.940> know<00:03:26.180> so<00:03:26.480> now<00:03:26.660> as<00:03:26.870> we<00:03:27.200> go<00:03:27.320> forward<00:03:27.530> we

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
you know so now as we go forward we

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:30.670 
you know so now as we go forward we
would<00:03:28.790> tighten<00:03:29.630> up<00:03:29.780> the<00:03:29.930> game<00:03:30.290> plan<00:03:30.500> but

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
would tighten up the game plan but

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.320 
would tighten up the game plan but
tighten<00:03:30.920> up<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.070> personnel<00:03:31.460> groups<00:03:31.700> and<00:03:32.000> the

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:32.330 
tighten up the personnel groups and the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:33.520 
tighten up the personnel groups and the
players<00:03:32.540> that<00:03:32.660> earned<00:03:32.900> the<00:03:33.050> right<00:03:33.170> to<00:03:33.230> be<00:03:33.350> out

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
players that earned the right to be out

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:34.780 
players that earned the right to be out
there<00:03:33.560> are<00:03:33.770> going<00:03:33.860> to<00:03:33.920> be<00:03:33.980> out<00:03:34.160> there<00:03:34.190> and<00:03:34.550> and

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
there are going to be out there and and

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.240 
there are going to be out there and and
then<00:03:35.210> when<00:03:35.330> you<00:03:35.420> play<00:03:35.570> an<00:03:35.630> opponent<00:03:36.250> hopefully

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:37.250 
then when you play an opponent hopefully

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.890 
then when you play an opponent hopefully

get me some of those what about special
person<00:03:39.800> I<00:03:40.640> thought<00:03:41.630> Joe<00:03:41.840> Roth<00:03:42.080> hit<00:03:42.260> a<00:03:42.290> pretty

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
person I thought Joe Roth hit a pretty

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.870 
person I thought Joe Roth hit a pretty
good<00:03:42.590> Kyle<00:03:42.950> I<00:03:42.980> think<00:03:43.280> made<00:03:43.400> all<00:03:43.550> his<00:03:43.640> kicks

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:43.880 
good Kyle I think made all his kicks

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.220 
good Kyle I think made all his kicks
tonight<00:03:44.090> which<00:03:44.690> was<00:03:44.810> good<00:03:44.960> to<00:03:45.050> see<00:03:45.200> that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
tonight which was good to see that

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.290 
tonight which was good to see that
coming<00:03:45.620> off<00:03:45.680> the<00:03:45.860> not-so-great<00:03:46.850> performance

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
coming off the not-so-great performance

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:49.090 
coming off the not-so-great performance
in<00:03:47.360> the<00:03:47.420> first<00:03:47.600> scrimmage<00:03:47.810> and<00:03:48.710> i<00:03:48.920> thought

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:49.100 
in the first scrimmage and i thought

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.740 
in the first scrimmage and i thought
tina<00:03:49.250> Gleason<00:03:49.640> dropped<00:03:50.090> one<00:03:50.240> inside<00:03:50.480> the<00:03:50.510> 10

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
tina Gleason dropped one inside the 10

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.060 
tina Gleason dropped one inside the 10
yard<00:03:50.780> man<00:03:51.110> which<00:03:51.230> we<00:03:51.350> think<00:03:51.470> he's<00:03:51.890> got<00:03:52.040> a

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:52.070 
yard man which we think he's got a

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:54.190 
yard man which we think he's got a
pretty<00:03:52.190> good<00:03:52.370> knack<00:03:52.550> for<00:03:52.810> so<00:03:53.810> as<00:03:53.930> we<00:03:54.080> go

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:54.200 
pretty good knack for so as we go

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.440 
pretty good knack for so as we go
forward<00:03:54.440> and<00:03:55.040> right<00:03:55.730> now<00:03:55.910> i<00:03:55.940> would<00:03:56.090> say<00:03:56.270> we'd

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
forward and right now i would say we'd

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.000 
forward and right now i would say we'd
use<00:03:56.540> both<00:03:56.750> burners<00:03:56.960> you<00:03:57.560> know<00:03:57.650> in<00:03:57.740> different

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010 
use both burners you know in different

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.860 
use both burners you know in different
situations<00:03:58.160> if<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.330> shakes<00:03:59.540> out<00:03:59.690> definitely

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
situations if that shakes out definitely

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.270 
situations if that shakes out definitely
over<00:04:00.140> the<00:04:00.200> next<00:04:00.410> week<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.710> could<00:04:00.800> change<00:04:00.980> grip

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
over the next week it could change grip

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.350 
over the next week it could change grip
if<00:04:01.460> you<00:04:01.550> were<00:04:01.640> playing<00:04:01.790> tomorrow<00:04:02.090> we're<00:04:02.240> using
