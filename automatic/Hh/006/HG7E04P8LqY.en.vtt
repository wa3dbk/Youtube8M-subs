types there are several important
factors

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:31.950 
factors

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:33.590 
factors
there's<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.520> brush<00:00:32.700> bar<00:00:32.880> that<00:00:33.030> spins<00:00:33.330> which

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
there's the brush bar that spins which

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.030 
there's the brush bar that spins which
loosens<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.110> agitates<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.560> dirt<00:00:34.770> and

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
loosens and agitates the dirt and

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.410 
loosens and agitates the dirt and
there's<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.520> suction<00:00:35.850> at<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:35.970> cleaner<00:00:36.030> head

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
there's the suction at the cleaner head

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
there's the suction at the cleaner head
pulling<00:00:36.720> the<00:00:36.870> dust<00:00:37.050> away<00:00:37.200> we've<00:00:37.830> got<00:00:37.950> a<00:00:38.160> moat

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
pulling the dust away we've got a moat

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.600 
pulling the dust away we've got a moat
here<00:00:38.610> that's<00:00:38.850> delivering<00:00:39.500> 25%<00:00:40.500> more<00:00:40.620> power<00:00:40.890> to

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
here that's delivering 25% more power to

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.460 
here that's delivering 25% more power to
this<00:00:41.730> newly<00:00:42.030> configured<00:00:42.270> brush<00:00:42.600> bar<00:00:42.840> and<00:00:43.320> that

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
this newly configured brush bar and that

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:45.979 
this newly configured brush bar and that
basically<00:00:43.770> drives<00:00:44.220> all<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.790> power<00:00:45.059> deeper

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
basically drives all that power deeper

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.020 
basically drives all that power deeper

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
into the carpet pile pulling allergens

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.760 
into the carpet pile pulling allergens
and<00:00:48.180> dirt<00:00:48.360> out<00:00:48.600> which<00:00:49.080> other<00:00:49.260> vacuums<00:00:49.650> leave

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
and dirt out which other vacuums leave

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
and dirt out which other vacuums leave
behind<00:00:50.180> we've<00:00:51.180> also<00:00:51.330> got<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> very<00:00:51.720> high

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260

look<00:00:55.260> here<00:00:55.590> there<00:00:56.400> are<00:00:56.489> 12<00:00:56.760> cyclones<00:00:57.600> which

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
look here there are 12 cyclones which

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.240 
look here there are 12 cyclones which
spin<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.170> air<00:00:58.260> very<00:00:58.530> very<00:00:58.710> quickly<00:00:58.949> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
spin the air very very quickly and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.399 
spin the air very very quickly and
create<00:00:59.489> incredible<00:00:59.909> forces<00:01:00.330> to<00:01:00.960> capture<00:01:01.320> the

tiniest<00:01:01.769> particles<00:01:02.480> if<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:03.659> look<00:01:03.780> at<00:01:03.870> this

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
tiniest particles if we look at this

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.200 
tiniest particles if we look at this
machine<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.979> doesn't<00:01:05.220> actually<00:01:05.430> have<00:01:05.790> any

separation and as a consequence it has

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.300 
separation and as a consequence it has
to<00:01:11.729> rely<00:01:11.909> heavily<00:01:12.060> on<00:01:12.479> this<00:01:12.900> porous<00:01:13.409> filter<00:01:14.190> to

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
to rely heavily on this porous filter to

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.330 
to rely heavily on this porous filter to

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.920 

the<00:01:20.340> problem<00:01:20.610> with<00:01:20.700> many<00:01:20.790> machines<00:01:21.210> is<00:01:21.540> the

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
the problem with many machines is the

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170 
the problem with many machines is the
clean<00:01:22.110> heads<00:01:22.320> are<00:01:22.530> set<00:01:22.980> a<00:01:23.010> fixed<00:01:23.610> height<00:01:23.760> above

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
clean heads are set a fixed height above

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.390 
clean heads are set a fixed height above
the<00:01:24.270> floor<00:01:24.450> surface<00:01:24.930> they<00:01:25.830> can't<00:01:26.070> adjust

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the floor surface they can't adjust

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.670 
the floor surface they can't adjust
between<00:01:26.760> different<00:01:27.030> floor<00:01:27.240> types<00:01:27.530> what<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
between different floor types what this

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.740 
between different floor types what this
means<00:01:28.980> is<00:01:29.220> they<00:01:29.370> have<00:01:29.490> a<00:01:29.520> large<00:01:29.820> gap<00:01:30.210> around

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
means is they have a large gap around

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.440 
means is they have a large gap around
the<00:01:31.650> perimeter<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.460> clean<00:01:32.670> head<00:01:32.910> if<00:01:33.120> we

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
the perimeter of the clean head if we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.030 
the perimeter of the clean head if we
put<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.660> light<00:01:33.870> behind<00:01:34.140> you<00:01:34.380> can<00:01:34.500> just<00:01:34.650> see<00:01:34.830> how

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
put a light behind you can just see how

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.400 
put a light behind you can just see how
pronounced<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.970> gap<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.450> that<00:01:37.140> is<00:01:37.230> going<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:37.410 
pronounced that gap is that is going to

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:39.590 
pronounced that gap is that is going to
be<00:01:37.500> wasting<00:01:38.010> a<00:01:38.220> huge<00:01:39.030> amount<00:01:39.270> of<00:01:39.330> suction

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
be wasting a huge amount of suction

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
be wasting a huge amount of suction
energy<00:01:40.020> especially<00:01:40.290> on<00:01:40.650> hard<00:01:40.830> floors

so<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.820> our<00:01:41.970> machine<00:01:42.120> we've<00:01:42.690> addressed<00:01:42.900> this

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
so in our machine we've addressed this

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.650 
so in our machine we've addressed this

still<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:02.940> very<00:02:03.180> very<00:02:03.480> easy<00:02:03.720> push<00:02:03.990> force

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 
still have very very easy push force

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:06.620 
still have very very easy push force
looking<00:02:05.160> closer<00:02:05.430> if<00:02:05.790> I<00:02:05.970> put<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.300> clean<00:02:06.480> head

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
looking closer if I put the clean head

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.660 
looking closer if I put the clean head
onto<00:02:06.750> carpet<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.800> can<00:02:07.830> see<00:02:08.100> that<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.340> bellows

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
onto carpet you can see that the bellows

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.980 
onto carpet you can see that the bellows
around<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.119> floating<00:02:09.480> soleplate

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
around the floating soleplate

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.870 
around the floating soleplate
are<00:02:10.140> compressed<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.980> when<00:02:11.100> I<00:02:11.130> put<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.370> onto<00:02:11.490> a

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
are compressed and when I put it onto a

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.290 
are compressed and when I put it onto a
hard<00:02:12.390> floor<00:02:12.660> surface<00:02:13.230> it<00:02:13.890> adjusts<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.760> you

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
hard floor surface it adjusts and you

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.210 
hard floor surface it adjusts and you
can<00:02:15.420> see<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.630> bellows<00:02:15.930> have<00:02:16.140> expanded<00:02:16.800> and

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
can see the bellows have expanded and

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.190 
can see the bellows have expanded and
that<00:02:17.250> again<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.880> maintaining<00:02:18.420> a<00:02:18.540> very<00:02:18.930> tight

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
that again is maintaining a very tight

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.260 
that again is maintaining a very tight
suction<00:02:19.620> seal<00:02:19.800> around<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.100> perimeter

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.640 

so<00:02:25.270> we've<00:02:25.420> strapped<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.840> machine<00:02:26.170> down<00:02:26.470> to

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
so we've strapped this machine down to

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.020 
so we've strapped this machine down to
what<00:02:26.740> we<00:02:26.830> call<00:02:26.950> an<00:02:27.070> air<00:02:27.190> what<00:02:27.340> spot's<00:02:27.640> and<00:02:27.940> that

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
what we call an air what spot's and that

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.680 
what we call an air what spot's and that
measures<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:29.110> suction<00:02:29.680> at<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.040> cleaner<00:02:30.220> head

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
measures the suction at the cleaner head

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.910 
measures the suction at the cleaner head
okay<00:02:31.690> so<00:02:31.750> if<00:02:31.960> I<00:02:32.020> turn<00:02:32.080> the<00:02:32.320> machine<00:02:32.620> on<00:02:34.800> you<00:02:35.800> can

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
okay so if I turn the machine on you can

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.620 
okay so if I turn the machine on you can
see<00:02:36.010> straight<00:02:36.220> away<00:02:36.460> we're<00:02:36.820> getting<00:02:37.090> very

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
see straight away we're getting very

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.050 
see straight away we're getting very
very<00:02:37.900> high<00:02:38.110> suction

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
very high suction

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.060 
very high suction
if<00:02:40.060> we<00:02:40.210> compare<00:02:40.390> ours<00:02:40.690> to<00:02:40.990> this<00:02:41.080> machine<00:02:41.320> we

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
if we compare ours to this machine we

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:43.980 
if we compare ours to this machine we
can<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.400> here<00:02:42.790> that<00:02:43.270> they're<00:02:43.390> significantly

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
can see here that they're significantly

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:46.680 
can see here that they're significantly
less<00:02:44.170> suction<00:02:44.650> at<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.830> cleaner<00:02:44.950> head<00:02:45.690> this

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
less suction at the cleaner head this

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:48.360 
less suction at the cleaner head this
