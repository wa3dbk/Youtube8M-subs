00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.750
 I told people, it's coming back here with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.340
 one more gameplay is do not stay 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.130
 concerned the channel will not become a 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.740
 The channel of who is is but is that it is more 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.590
 easy for me post-surgery to record a 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.930
 so I'm going to talk a little bit 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.029
 Less but I wanted to show you fifa. 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.820
 15 ultimate team that went out in the store 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.830
 Canadian apple store only 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.650
 I do not know why the place makes the 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.930
 google you can download normally but 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.210
 for me and only in the canadian store 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.059
 I have no idea why we choose 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:42.540
 here with a card I'll choose the 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.100
 england how to open it with my hand here 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.739
 I'm in control of what I did. 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.200
 boxing in if you did not see watch the video of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.010
 control box to that your cast 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.190
 FC Porto young downpour holder that 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.690
 wonderful 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.460
 Let's see how it works here. 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 not only 15 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.550
 here are some basic controls, right? 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:06.049
 but for the screen and not with the control teaches 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:12.920
 because here at least pause works 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.920
 but to leave does not work here is good 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:24.810
 usually touch here is what 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:32.939
 Believe the wonder is the setting is 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:38.490
 very different from fifa itself but the 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:42.479
 ball to change this but apparently 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:46.110
 For a mobile game, you can. 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:50.490
 see an evolution so I do not know if it has 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:55.829
 someone who plays a lot of game 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:59.670
 cell phone football on cell phone 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:03.180
 I play football a lot but the cell phone 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:07.290
 I confess that it is very complicated with 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.879
 control is already there is very different right 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.690
 I'll show you here how it is that 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:13.480
 works the ultimate team clothes wear 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.970
 collect here 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.670
 As you can see, my cast is 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.500
 very limited, right? 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.450
 I like to play what you can change to 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.879
 formation 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:29.620
 He's fine, it's very light. 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:32.680
 Can you cast a cast? 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:35.590
 can transfer players then 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.720
 that the transfer market here is 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.040
 From what I've seen he's not tied to the 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.829
 console game then it's a game apart 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:49.360
 Are you there? Come from meats and such. 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:57.609
 I do not think so 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:59.890
 You can play with friends like this and save the 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:02.470
 facebook login that promises to continue 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.690
 things are very interesting 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.090
 I think they left the game as well. 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.579
 apparently very similar to the one in the 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.609
 console and I think you can have fun 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:16.299
 Quite a great game is a free game 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:20.590
 and obviously they sell items here to 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:22.870
 You said right there. 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.590
 they earn money but here they have 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:29.430
 some initials whatever it may open 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.430
 about this from here for you to see 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.540
 look that 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:44.980
 the chain maybe just beauty or in 4 or 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.900
 save everything in my club and then I 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.459
 I'm going to fit 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.129
 because I'm going to open the remains there for 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:54.939
 set up my team 

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:56.319
 You can buy the obvious I put it. 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:00.609
 here on facebook to see what 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:03.159
 I just won a reward, right? 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:05.280
 for connecting aquino on facebook stall 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:08.230
 my account 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.139
 Let's see here if you play online appear 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.489
 Something he shows the score to 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:16.120
 see if you 're better off with your friends 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:24.280
 or we will not see if at least here they 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:26.490
 they put ours that what is the one of the league 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.490
 on here 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.970
 It's the Brazilian league does not appear here. 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:37.180
 also 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:41.729
 the Brazilian league does not appear in any 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:44.020
 of the games on the console and not here in the 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:50.710
 ultimate team mobile 

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:52.240
 let's support the chelsea ok wonder and 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:55.030

 For you to have fun, I hope you do not 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.310
 They have a very competitive team that avoid 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:05.110
 enough with this game 

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.229

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.599

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:13.120
