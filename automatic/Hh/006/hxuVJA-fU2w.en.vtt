00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
 two weeks after that 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.629
 World Cup triathlon as a ratomka 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:04.920
 again takes prestigious 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.359
 competitions no tournament and immediately kiss 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.219
 series 

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.459
 over a hundred athletes from seven countries will 

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:12.199
 shine your skills in one 

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:13.990
 of the most spectacular equestrian disciplines 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.219
 sports competitor competitions 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:18.380
 Jumping and overcoming obstacles passes 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.130
 in Belarus since 1999 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.000
 the forced break was only once 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.960
 when the sports complex was closed 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.099
 for renovation now updated 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.419
 base meets all requirements 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:30.269
 international standard and again 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.949
 lifts athletes only by 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.720
 I have had a break for three whole years and 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.390
 World Cup stage 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.850
 it is too early 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.749
 how difficult was it to spend 4 

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.079
 a repetition of this venture of such 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.870
 level 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.220
 and now started in the government and when 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.710
 Here is this field in general as after restoration 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.230
 which also took place 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.120
 she was a special horse discipline 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.200
 sports competition for hitting for example 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.839
 the olympiad is very high 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:00:59.899
 compared to disembarkation and triathlon 

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:01.889
 during the Olympic selection period 

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:03.559
 starts which athlete take 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:05.199
 participation can go up to twenty 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.369
 five main goal to earn as much as possible 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:09.679
 less penalty points successful performance 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:11.689
 largely depend not only on readiness 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:14.110
 Sannikov's horses on this he can they 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:15.420
 find mutual understanding 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.259
 voloshin how many people will say their 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:17.930
 character 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.030
 however by measures and the other is lazy then 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.620
 of course every inhabitant 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.680
 already 30 years 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.310
 in the course, therefore, in May that Russia 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.799
 listen to the recordings 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:29.229
 to negotiate because when 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.290
 sales to sharm ash sheikh dahab you 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.420
 full of trust between the council of libya 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.110
 so work despite the fact that the cup stage 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.180
 World Cup and Nations Competition Level 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.580
 two stars meaning points earned 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.719
 here the Olympic standings do not go 

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:43.389
 but confused came a record number 

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:45.700
 athletes and here you can select on 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.619
 2011 European Championship this year 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.520
 fight for victory at the world cup stage and 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.369
 Nations Cup there will be sports couples from 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.129
 Belarus, Moldova, Russia, Latvia, Lithuania, Lithuania 

00:01:54.129 --> 00:01:56.719
 Estonian and Finnish competitions 

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:58.359
 equestrian sports have long been for 

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:59.489
 belarus traditional 

00:01:59.489 --> 00:02:01.499
 annually the strongest seal seals 

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:02.749
 brother then to conquer another 

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:03.660
 title 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.260
 at home it is not always successful 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.300
 play for the national team of Belarus in this 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.350
 year the team will be represented 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.170
 the strongest composition I find Alexander 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.370
 Nasonov on the Internet
