00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
on one and it's gone frustrated by the

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.100 
on one and it's gone frustrated by the
abuse<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.320> this<00:01:28.759> elegant<00:01:29.759> concept<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> decided

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
abuse of this elegant concept I decided

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.330 
abuse of this elegant concept I decided
to<00:01:31.320> make<00:01:31.829> my<00:01:31.860> own<00:01:32.210> that<00:01:33.210> possibly<00:01:33.689> won't<00:01:33.960> break

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 
to make my own that possibly won't break

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.399 
to make my own that possibly won't break
so<00:01:35.340> I've<00:01:35.490> got<00:01:35.640> my<00:01:35.670> knife<00:01:36.180> out<00:01:36.390> and<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.810> stove<00:01:37.110> and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
so I've got my knife out and I stove and

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.219 
so I've got my knife out and I stove and
a<00:01:37.500> piece<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.710> wood<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.610> cut<00:01:39.270> I<00:01:39.479> carved<00:01:40.079> this

a piece of wood and I cut I carved this

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
a piece of wood and I cut I carved this

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
though it's probably not the most

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.200 
though it's probably not the most
practical<00:01:51.180> one<00:01:51.659> I<00:01:52.649> like<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.520> because<00:01:53.640> my<00:01:54.000> first

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210

in the woods here's another one it's a
more<00:02:01.980> refined<00:02:02.370> version<00:02:02.640> which<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.120> use<00:02:03.300> when

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
more refined version which I use when

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.920 
more refined version which I use when

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
if I lose it somewhere guess what I

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.990 
if I lose it somewhere guess what I
could<00:02:24.150> make<00:02:24.270> another<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.720> now<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:26.670> extend

that<00:02:57.990> the<00:02:58.500> problem<00:02:58.860> is<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.820> fires<00:03:00.060> very<00:03:00.510> hot

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
that the problem is the fires very hot

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.890 
that the problem is the fires very hot
so<00:03:01.020> we<00:03:01.140> have<00:03:01.320> we<00:03:01.500> have<00:03:01.560> always<00:03:01.830> problems<00:03:02.580> them

so we have we have always problems them
mr.<00:03:03.900> fire<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:05.730> what<00:03:06.120> I<00:03:06.150> did<00:03:06.269> was<00:03:06.480> actually<00:03:07.019> took

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.410 
mr. fire so what I did was actually took

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.810 
mr. fire so what I did was actually took
the<00:03:07.709> sport<00:03:08.670> concept<00:03:09.500> a<00:03:10.500> bit<00:03:11.100> further<00:03:11.370> and

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
the sport concept a bit further and

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:20.090 
the sport concept a bit further and
actually<00:03:15.320> crafted<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:18.530> what<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.560> would<00:03:19.830> call

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
actually crafted this what I would call

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.400 
actually crafted this what I would call
the<00:03:20.489> Altis<00:03:21.150> book<00:03:21.739> now<00:03:23.450> it<00:03:24.450> is<00:03:24.660> probably<00:03:24.930> the

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
the Altis book now it is probably the

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.920 
the Altis book now it is probably the
most<00:03:25.440> useful<00:03:25.880> implement<00:03:26.880> that<00:03:27.060> I<00:03:27.239> have<00:03:27.540> ever

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
most useful implement that I have ever

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:32.420 
most useful implement that I have ever
ever<00:03:28.260> used<00:03:29.030> by<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.060> campfire<00:03:31.130> this<00:03:32.130> is<00:03:32.280> not

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
ever used by a campfire this is not

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.670 
ever used by a campfire this is not
finished<00:03:32.790> yet<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.330> what<00:03:34.080> while<00:03:34.290> I<00:03:34.320> was<00:03:34.500> making

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
finished yet but what while I was making

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.860 
finished yet but what while I was making
it<00:03:35.010> I<00:03:36.019> couldn't<00:03:37.019> stop<00:03:37.230> using<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:38.450> let's<00:03:39.450> say<00:03:39.660> is

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
it I couldn't stop using it let's say is

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.600 
it I couldn't stop using it let's say is
here<00:03:40.140> we<00:03:40.260> have<00:03:40.380> bacon<00:03:40.590> cooking<00:03:41.100> rather<00:03:41.459> than

your copies etc etc another great thing

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.690 
your copies etc etc another great thing
is<00:04:09.959> because<00:04:10.319> it's<00:04:10.530> so<00:04:10.680> steady<00:04:11.069> and<00:04:11.190> slightly

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
is because it's so steady and slightly

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.000 
is because it's so steady and slightly
well<00:04:12.450> it's<00:04:12.599> fire<00:04:12.810> resistance<00:04:13.319> or<00:04:13.500> fireproof

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
well it's fire resistance or fireproof

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.159 
well it's fire resistance or fireproof
but<00:04:14.250> it<00:04:14.940> will<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.330> melt<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.780> the<00:04:15.959> plastic

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
but it will not melt like the plastic

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:20.390 
but it will not melt like the plastic
one<00:04:16.560> does<00:04:17.269> it<00:04:18.269> could<00:04:18.389> also<00:04:18.540> be<00:04:18.750> used<00:04:18.900> as<00:04:19.290> a<00:04:19.350> as<00:04:20.340> a

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
one does it could also be used as a as a

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.620 
one does it could also be used as a as a
rule<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.500> as<00:04:22.500> the<00:04:22.800> way<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:24.090> to<00:04:24.180> get<00:04:24.300> used<00:04:24.479> to

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
rule to as the way have to get used to

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.950 
rule to as the way have to get used to
it<00:04:24.660> easier<00:04:25.110> like<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.500> but<00:04:26.510> you<00:04:27.510> can<00:04:27.690> pick

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
it easier like this but you can pick

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.640 
it easier like this but you can pick
things<00:04:28.169> up<00:04:28.470> out<00:04:29.340> of<00:04:29.400> the<00:04:29.700> fire<00:04:29.970> with<00:04:30.300> it<00:04:30.650> like
