00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it's pretty happy with that the other

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.150 
it's pretty happy with that the other
thing<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.120> really<00:00:45.360> liked<00:00:45.570> was<00:00:45.800> now<00:00:46.800> this<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.129> the

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
thing I really liked was now this is the

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.770 
thing I really liked was now this is the
2008<00:00:48.000> version<00:00:48.469> I<00:00:49.469> believe<00:00:49.980> in<00:00:50.570> comparison<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
2008 version I believe in comparison to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.439 
2008 version I believe in comparison to
the<00:00:52.079> I<00:00:52.350> think<00:00:52.590> it's<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.829> 2010<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.760> newer<00:00:53.940> version

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the I think it's a 2010 or newer version

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.119 
the I think it's a 2010 or newer version
so<00:00:55.289> in<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.530> version<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:56.010> has<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.910> window<00:00:57.329> and

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
so in this version it has the window and

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.580 
so in this version it has the window and
this<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.780> hood<00:01:00.780> thing<00:01:01.079> which<00:01:01.289> i<00:01:01.410> guess<00:01:01.559> is

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
this little hood thing which i guess is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.139 
this little hood thing which i guess is
great<00:01:01.949> if<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.489> want<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> do<00:01:02.879> a<00:01:02.910> little

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
great if you want to do a little

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.770 
great if you want to do a little
additional<00:01:03.449> venting<00:01:03.989> underneath<00:01:05.780> but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
additional venting underneath but

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.410 
additional venting underneath but
otherwise<00:01:07.200> i<00:01:07.350> would<00:01:07.710> i<00:01:07.979> would<00:01:08.670> probably<00:01:09.240> just

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
otherwise i would i would probably just

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.830 
otherwise i would i would probably just
remove<00:01:09.720> it<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:12.210> other<00:01:12.330> kind<00:01:12.600> of<00:01:12.689> nice

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
remove it the other kind of nice

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.260 
remove it the other kind of nice
features<00:01:13.110> it<00:01:13.590> has<00:01:14.540> three<00:01:15.540> zips<00:01:16.970> so<00:01:17.970> if<00:01:18.090> you

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
features it has three zips so if you

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:27.679 
features it has three zips so if you
want<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:23.659> get<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.750> part<00:01:25.080> way<00:01:25.909> like<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:27.150> you<00:01:27.420> can

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
want to get a part way like that you can

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:41.240 
want to get a part way like that you can
or<00:01:28.590> you<00:01:28.619> can<00:01:28.920> fully<00:01:29.270> detach<00:01:30.270> it

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.230

change it has these little clip systems
here<00:03:00.540> which<00:03:01.540> I<00:03:01.690> would<00:03:01.810> prefer<00:03:01.989> to<00:03:02.170> have<00:03:02.640> little

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
here which I would prefer to have little

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.370 
here which I would prefer to have little
eyelets<00:03:05.370> those<00:03:06.370> might<00:03:06.580> break<00:03:06.820> I<00:03:07.320> think<00:03:08.320> it

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
eyelets those might break I think it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.910 
eyelets those might break I think it
doesn't<00:03:08.590> go<00:03:08.800> fully<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.400> the<00:03:09.430> ground<00:03:10.800> see<00:03:11.800> it

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
doesn't go fully to the ground see it

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:20.300 
doesn't go fully to the ground see it
has<00:03:12.640> about<00:03:14.010> 44<00:03:15.010> inch<00:03:15.160> rise<00:03:15.430> off<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:15.940> ground

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.070 

other<00:03:21.310> than<00:03:21.550> that<00:03:21.640> pretty<00:03:22.739> stoked<00:03:23.739> with<00:03:23.830> it<00:03:24.070> I

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
other than that pretty stoked with it I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.900 
other than that pretty stoked with it I
like<00:03:26.080> it<00:03:26.260> weighs<00:03:26.410> just<00:03:26.470> about<00:03:27.010> over<00:03:27.400> 5<00:03:27.640> pounds

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
like it weighs just about over 5 pounds

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:29.580 
like it weighs just about over 5 pounds
i<00:03:28.180> think<00:03:28.209> it's<00:03:28.420> five<00:03:28.600> pounds<00:03:28.930> eight<00:03:29.050> ounces<00:03:29.080> or

i think it's five pounds eight ounces or

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.570 
i think it's five pounds eight ounces or
so<00:03:31.560> you<00:03:32.560> will<00:03:32.709> have<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.980> get<00:03:33.130> some<00:03:33.340> additional
