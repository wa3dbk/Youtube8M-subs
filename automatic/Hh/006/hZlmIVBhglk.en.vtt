00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.060
 i 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.920
 olive saw for the whole world 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.020
 our production process and thought to the 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.330
 detail so that a simple olive 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.220
 is extracted from one of the best things 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:23.109
 are made in portugal and the rest of the globe 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.910
 guard is website 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.220
 everything starts with the situation of the 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.140
 varieties of olive trees to be 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.420
 chosen according to the properties 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.790
 organoleptic properties of your site 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.610
 productive climate and the climate of the 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.769
 in which nurseries will arrive at 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.769
 small olive trees that are planted with 

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:44.140
 gps feature a north-south orientation 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.949
 that maximizes sun exposure so 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:50.229
 favor the production of olive 

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.960
 so the olive tree of the mountain makes necessary 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:55.089
 largest olive grove in the world where thanks to 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.040
 integrated protection system to 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:59.559
 olive trees and produce 

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.900
 environmentally responsible 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.119
 our olive trees do not depend only on the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.119
 rain to get water from our rivals 

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:08.860
 have a drip irrigation system 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.070
 controlled by telemetry that holds the 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.260
 optimum water conditions on the soil is 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.480
 ting point of ripeness of the 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.150
 Olive is the time of harvesting 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.730
 country we have some machines 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.190
 adapted from the vineyard with 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:26.260
 accommodate up to six hectares per day 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.280
 one of the secrets to the quality of 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:29.860
 our site 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.110
 we can not reveal everyone and quickly with 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.100
 that we harvest and we go to the 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.010
 place 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.280
 I received from the olive already in the place this is only 

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:42.070
 taught clear and sent from the 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.080
 will result in a paste that the 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.600
 exact temperature and for an hour and a half 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.600
 shall be slaughtered to ensure the 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 most efficient of all 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.900
 olive oil 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.450
 then follow if the centrifugal actions 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.450
 before separation of the azait from the others 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.070
 constituent is from the water of the 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.040
 lump and pulp 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.320
 later it is sung during 24 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.630
 hours in deposits designed for the 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.360
 thereby preserving the purity of the 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.360
 product and the true flavor of 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.270
 oliveira da serra after these three phases 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.750
 haiti evidence this assessment determines the 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:20.610
 the organoleptic quality of the product 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.860
 paul ii integrate and store the second 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.870
 your profile already in the phase of the allotment 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.550
 we combine sites with different 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.130
 characteristics to ensure the 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.390
 taste and aroma profile of each of the 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.640
 our products 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.740
 in the end each batch is already so extensive 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.350
 set of analyzes that confirmed its 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.890
 high level of quality genuineness for 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.900
 end is bottled labeled and quickly 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.340
 shipped to our customers for 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.950
 that can reach our consumers 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.290
 with finished site properties 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.790
 first 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.380
 for oliveira da serra a 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.530
 environmental sustainability and 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.380
 important pillar in this process is nothing 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:59.760
 lose everything turns we use the core 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.260
 in our chairs 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.030
 we forward the sheets to the 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.070
 fertilization of soil and water 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:10.890
 after treatment for irrigation acting in 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.840
 present to think about the future we harmonize 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.090
 the competitiveness of industry 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.410
 the sustainability of our fields 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.330
 proof of this is our most recent 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.670
 symbol a place that is a reference 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.830
 technological and architectural 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.959
 same heart of one of our olive groves 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.299
 with a processing capacity of 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.310
 40 tons of olive for now 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.950
 daily production can reach 200 thousand 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.900
 liters of olive oil is based on 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.790
 a constant and we invent to 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.950
 accompany and demands of the times and 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.250
 ensure the modernization of agriculture and 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.330
 of productive methods 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.160
 so we also ensure 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.110
 competitiveness and quality that they have 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.390
 of us a reference in the production of 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.579
 olive oil as the world already knows it and being 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.959
 the only large company in the sector present 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:57.060
 across the value chain 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:59.400
 We assume another commitment of 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.290
 environmental responsibility is it 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.600
 we respond that being more carbon in the 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.730
 that we produce for our site 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.829
 is the world and the world continues to be 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.260
 all of the peoples of all nations. 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.220
 cultures of all generations 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.220
 Today and tomorrow
