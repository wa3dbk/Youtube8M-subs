00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:03.420
Konstantina ise already with Dimitra Goula, 

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:07.360
who is making her dynamic come back to our show.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.460
They will show us how to make a glowing facial mask and 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.140
and lotion using orange as the main ingredient. 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.440
Dimitra welcome back!

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.360
Hello!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.460
It's so good to see you all!

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.120
What lovely things have you prepared for us today?

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.040
Today we will make a glowing mask containg orange, 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:28.620
clay and caster sugar,

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.300
and a glowing lotion, using orange essence which

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.880
will make all on our own!

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.820
There will be no need to buy essential oils etc

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.740
I will show you how to get the essential oils straight

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:41.880
from the orange. 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.000
It's also the right season to do this.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.380
Yes, because it is orange season.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:47.440
That's right.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.240
- Why do we use orange?
- You tell us!

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.020
I see you know quite a lot!

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.320
I've brought my cheat sheet with me!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.280
It contains vitamins C, it helps with rejuvenation, 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.360
its a collagen activator, it helps the skin shine,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:00.080
it gets rid of blemishes...

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.520
And by blemishes I mean all the discolourations

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.820
that happen to our skin due to sun exposure.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.260
It helps the skin shine, its especially good to use 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:12.280
for formal events 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.080
Does it also contribute to the skins defense?

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.460
Of course, because vitamin C boosts the skins

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.720
natural defense against bacteria, infections and such. 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.020
Good idea, put your gloves on.

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.620
We need to be careful and clean!

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.460
What shall we start with?

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.080
Our ingredients are clay, orange, caster sugar and..?

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.040
That's it.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.900
And this is for the facial mask?

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.900
For the mask. We don't need anything else.

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.000
We need this to make our mask.

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.760
What are the differences?

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.040
Clay contains metals and trace elements specifically  

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.600
aimed at nourishing the skin, 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.680
caster sugar is a moisture magnet, 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.340
meaning that it moisturises the skin.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.340
Its truly amazing in a facial mask.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.380
May I add something,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.480
isn't there a beach on the island of Paros

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.640
which is full of clay and people use it on their skin?

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.620
And in Paros, and Crete...

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.160
So it's true. I've also tried it!

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.080
Yes of course, it's amazing,

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.960
it's thalassotherapy.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.080
Your skin is left soft as silk!

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.380
Apply everywhere and then rinse off,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.000
using sea water.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.360
Its is truly great.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.920
And lastly orange juice.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.320
The juice of half and orange?

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.520
No not so much.

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.900
Here, you can start stirring using the brush, 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:27.940
while I add the juice.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.020
Mix until it becomes a paste.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.180
Let me see...

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.180
I think this is perfect.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.180
Bravo.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.260
It is perfect..

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.400
Please give me the glove so we can show

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.760
how easy this is to apply.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.880
We leave it on for 20 minutes, 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.960
and in the end our skin is smooth and shiny!

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.800
Here I should add that due to the fact that orange

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.400
contains acid, which is the reason it helps remove

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.960
dead skin cells resulting in the skin glowing, 

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:04.980
it should not be used on very sensitive skin.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I was meaning to ask you that.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.120
It's best for people with very sensitive skin to avoid this treatment.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.900
 How about on dry skin, oily and combination skin?

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020
This is for all skin types, 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.780
just not for very sensitive skin.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:21.100
Shall we move on to the lotion?

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.100
How about women with acne?

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.940
This is ideal. It is ideal for acne.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:27.800
Very nice.

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.760
As I said it remove the skins dead cells, 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.060
enhancing skin rejuvenation 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.700
and it helps the skin really shine. 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.800
This is why the skin looks much cleaner, 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.380
and skin infections are avoided.

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.380
Such as acne.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:49.800
Now, using the same orange,

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.980
we will only need one orange, not even two!

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.160
We peel its skin off.. 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160
So we're also saving money.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.300
That's right.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:01.160
The skin of the orange contains all its essential oils.

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
 Look how simple it is to get the essential oils..

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.880
For the lotion, first we need 25ml of rosewater.

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.580
This is our lotion here.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.220
This is the finished product, you can see that

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.220
its white.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.680
Rosewater is used quite often when making

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.700
natural and fresh cosmetics.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.680
Yes, because it hydrates, its for all skin types, 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:29.680
See how nice it smells?

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.620
Just like orange.

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.620
It's all because of the essential oils.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.340
You can see this is white, and now

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.700
as soon as I add the orange essence it will turn yellow.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.220
I'm not sure if this is visible...

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.380
By creasing the skin, the essential oils burst out.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:45.400
just like a cloud.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.460
Do we need more then half an orange peel?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.720
We might need a bit more.

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:58.540
It will immediately turn yellow.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.300
These properties are not found in the orange? On the inside I mean.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.300
No, the essential oils are found in the peel.

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.300
OK, so only in the orange peel.

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.460
This isn't clearly visible from the TV.. 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.920
how the oils burst from the skin. 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.500
I'll demonstrate using a lighter.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:24.420
You see?

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.280
I'm not sure if you can see this..

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:31.360
I think we got it.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.860
So, the essential oils are derived from the orange peel, 

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.580
and into our rosewater giving it a yellow colour. 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.160
What kind of quantities do we use?

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.040
I always insist on using small quantities

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.000
 when making fresh cosmetics because their shelf life

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.020
is very short. 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.000
This for instance can be stored only in the fridge, 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.620
but it will last for a maximum of 30 days.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.800
But by 15 days it will have finished.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.800
And that's the way it should be; fresh cosmetics

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.460
should be used up quickly.

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.840
Therefore its best to use small containers.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.360
In any case, the cost is very small.

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.360
Even now in the winter?

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.360
Yes of course.

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:16.360
The products we just made, 

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.820
the mask and the lotion...

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.820
I forgot to mention how to use the lotion.

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.240
So after the facial mask, we use this lotion

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.020
as a toner.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.360
So our therapy is complete.

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.360
After we moisturise etc

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:34.700
We apply the mask the mask for how long?

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:36.180
20 minutes.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:38.760
We rinse it off with warm water?

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:40.760
With lukewarm water, always. 

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.360
Lukewarm to cool water.

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:50.240
If we use hot water we may create other skin irritations

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.800
 and sensitivities.

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:55.660
And after?

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:58.700
Using cotton wool we apply the lotion?

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.160
Yes, apply to all the face.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.360
We don't wash it off?

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:06.960
We don't rinse it off, we leave the toner on 

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.900
and on top of that we apply our moisturizing cream.

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:10.900
Our skin will be absolutely glowing!

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:12.440
Lovely.

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.140
If someone has very dry skin, 

00:07:15.140 --> 00:07:19.000
and they want to try this facial mask, 

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.800
its best to add some almond oil too.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:27.300
Just a teaspoon, just to give the mask an extra

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:28.540
moisturising effect.

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:30.040
This is to the facial mask?

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.040
Yes.

00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:35.100
Thank you very much.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:36.420
Thank you too.

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.420
I'll just take my notes and go!
