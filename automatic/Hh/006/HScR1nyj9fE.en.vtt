 we started in the whole process we started 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.410
 already to the trainings 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.260
 and now we are finishing the few 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.750
 details are the things but the idea is 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.210

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.910

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.460
 work a month on the beast for that 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350
 change for this transcript and 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.900
 we simply wait for you because this 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.360
 I hope to convey the emotion we have 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.930
 of that joy 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.230
 good today's video is super 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.060
 important myself I 'll share 

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.830
 four exercises 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.350
 jose through the ones I've said in all 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.110
 videos but the same and they are the four 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:44.450
 exercises that allow you to have 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.729
 muscle development but at the same time is that 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.960
 after these four exercises 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.340
 simply your development is 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.100
 guaranteed 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:57.000
 I know that in typical gyms you 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.520
 they say make a thousand machines and everything but the 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.640
 truth is that if you want a 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.509
 true development you need these 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.869
 four exercises 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.179
 ok do these four exercises what 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.710
 others that you do good complementary but 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:16.520
 this is the number one plot 

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:19.360
 squats ok guys if you do not do 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.360
 squats 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.120
 maybe it's just what beast 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.310
 develops absolutely everything because 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.700
 to make a city correctly 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.040
 you must put even from what you 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.100
 you put the boat your back of our 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.280
 intense shoulders arms all in the 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.730
 section must be tight legs 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:48.930
 that is, they are well placed to know if 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.460
 is well done number one number two is 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.160
 dead guys birds dead 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:58.620
 this is the favorite exercise they have 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.790
 what to do is basic growth and 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.980
 muscle development 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.769
 deadlift guys who works 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:08.640
 absolutely everything but especially all 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.760
 the rear chain back however in 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:15.860
 actually the deadlift where he works 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:18.390
 of the fingers because this weight 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.310
 absolutely all the feet all everything 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.220
 it has to work what it allows you 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.129
 this there is a greater production of 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.599
 testosterone growth hormone 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:33.120
 absolutely everything you need 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:36.269
 ok number three guys do not forget press 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:39.970
 military at a head price for two 

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:42.840
 nothing nothing to be like in accounts 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.840
 and to work 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:51.460
 that is very important in fact you have 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:55.870
 that your banking company grows 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:58.450
 as a basic military press that this makes you 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.100
 a development but to the beast forces 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.080
 who practice some sport that 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:08.630
 develops power but as one is 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.630
 number 44 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.080
 Boys 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.150
 but this we are going to preserve those summits 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.950
 good to measure strength do not take it as 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:21.130
 there are people that the press of 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:24.730
 banking is the most important thing is not going on 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.130
 that other ready bench press you need 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:29.830
 do just for the development 

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:32.170
 obviously victory of the podium but what 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.770
 that many people do is the subject of 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.770
 isolation 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:41.530
 if you work pectorals if writing is a 

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:43.449
 little shorter if you've seen a 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.490
 Lifting point lifter 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:48.160
 power a little shorter 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.320
 before that 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:53.080
 you have to literally put attention 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:56.370
 absolutely your whole body from the 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.370
 feet has settled 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.330
 absolutely everything and finally a 

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:08.550
 additional exercise that I am for me 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:11.100
 without this the other four are not equal 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:14.820
 complete you need to do this exercise 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.690
 and guess what dominated dominated 

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:20.970
 guys dominate this exercise the bars 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.860
 are very important are basic to the 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.770
 development that works absolutely 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.040
 all right you have others you want arms 

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:32.070
 you have abdomen that works absolutely 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:34.920
 all because a bar is simply 

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:37.410
 impressive to create the development 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:39.300
 you want muscular ok 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:42.840
 very good two girls that's all in this 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.370
 video they use these five exercises and they go 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:48.060
 to see that your results are going to be 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.720
 just awesome ok guys if 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.670
 the desperate girls boys of the 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:58.130
 Swans' removed is simply the best 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:02.600

 heart so much love that it will be to the 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:07.420
