a<00:01:41.490> Wi-Fi<00:01:41.579> router<00:01:41.939> then<00:01:42.420> since<00:01:42.750> it's<00:01:42.899> connected

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
a Wi-Fi router then since it's connected

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
directly to your internet connection yes

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.249 
directly to your internet connection yes
correct<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.270> will<00:01:45.390> also<00:01:45.509> act<00:01:45.750> as<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:45.899> wireless

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
correct it will also act as a wireless

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.889 
correct it will also act as a wireless
router<00:01:46.409> for<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.829> okay<00:01:47.399> and<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:47.880> we're<00:01:48.780> these

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
router for that okay and so we're these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.090 
router for that okay and so we're these
going<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.590> when<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.740> they<00:01:49.829> come<00:01:49.950> out

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
going to be at and when do they come out

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.219 
going to be at and when do they come out
how<00:01:50.610> soon<00:01:50.790> can<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.329> find<00:01:51.600> this<00:01:51.720> they'll<00:01:52.140> be
