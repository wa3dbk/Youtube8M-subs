00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.439 
but I still want to point out a couple
of<00:00:19.350> things<00:00:19.590> here<00:00:19.770> first<00:00:20.490> off<00:00:20.699> does<00:00:21.180> this<00:00:21.300> look

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
of things here first off does this look

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.240 
of things here first off does this look
familiar<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.930> guys<00:00:22.199> this<00:00:22.439> used<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.740> happen<00:00:22.980> in

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
familiar you guys this used to happen in

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.060 
familiar you guys this used to happen in
NHL<00:00:23.640> 15<00:00:23.820> when<00:00:24.480> your<00:00:25.199> your<00:00:25.590> players<00:00:25.920> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
NHL 15 when your your players and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.740 
NHL 15 when your your players and
opposing<00:00:26.550> teams<00:00:26.730> were<00:00:26.939> used<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.269> get<00:00:27.420> cramped

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
opposing teams were used to get cramped

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.960 
opposing teams were used to get cramped
up<00:00:27.869> against<00:00:28.470> each<00:00:28.560> other<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:29.039> that<00:00:29.699> wouldn't

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
up against each other and that wouldn't

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.720 
up against each other and that wouldn't
make<00:00:30.060> you<00:00:30.240> unable<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.720> move<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.730> it's

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
make you unable to move and it's

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.060 
make you unable to move and it's
surprising<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.630> that<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.440> haven't<00:00:34.829> fixed

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
surprising that that they haven't fixed

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.350 
surprising that that they haven't fixed
this<00:00:35.280> even<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.790> NHL<00:00:36.180> 16<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.160> the<00:00:38.160> AI<00:00:38.430> is<00:00:38.730> still

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
this even in NHL 16 and the AI is still

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.020 
this even in NHL 16 and the AI is still
bad<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.899> until<00:00:40.230> 16<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.760> gameplay

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
bad in until 16 so this is a gameplay

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.979 
bad in until 16 so this is a gameplay
work-in-progress

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
work-in-progress

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.799 
work-in-progress
I<00:00:43.110> hope<00:00:43.500> this<00:00:43.739> gets<00:00:43.980> fixed<00:00:44.430> for<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:44.879> final

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
I hope this gets fixed for the final

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:48.590 
I hope this gets fixed for the final
release<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> game<00:00:46.879> now<00:00:47.879> for<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.180> gameplay

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
release of the game now for the gameplay

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.209 
release of the game now for the gameplay

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
itself there's not many changes that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.569 
itself there's not many changes that
have<00:00:50.370> occurred<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.940> NHL<00:00:51.420> 16<00:00:51.600> but<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:53.250> small

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
have occurred in NHL 16 but like small

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.400 
have occurred in NHL 16 but like small
different<00:00:54.120> small<00:00:54.329> changes<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.780> appearances

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
different small changes and appearances

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.590 
different small changes and appearances
like<00:00:55.770> minor<00:00:56.039> changes<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.640> skating<00:00:57.120> as<00:00:57.239> well<00:00:57.449> in

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
like minor changes in skating as well in

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
like minor changes in skating as well in
commentary<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.530> really<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.980> only

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
commentary but really the only

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
commentary but really the only
difference<00:00:59.670> is<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.390> previous<00:01:01.230> game<00:01:01.469> modes

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
difference is that previous game modes

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.450 
difference is that previous game modes
like<00:01:01.920> an<00:01:02.100> e<00:01:02.430> sh<00:01:02.850> l<00:01:03.199> have<00:01:04.199> been<00:01:04.439> added<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:04.949> NHL

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
like an e sh l have been added into NHL

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.399 
like an e sh l have been added into NHL
16<00:01:05.640> when<00:01:06.090> really<00:01:06.570> they<00:01:06.750> should<00:01:06.780> have<00:01:07.110> been<00:01:07.260> an

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
16 when really they should have been an

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.140 
16 when really they should have been an
inch<00:01:07.560> or<00:01:07.740> 15<00:01:08.450> but<00:01:10.010> did<00:01:11.010> this<00:01:11.220> here's<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.820> spot

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
inch or 15 but did this here's a spot

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.120 
inch or 15 but did this here's a spot
that<00:01:12.180> I<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.450> to<00:01:12.720> stop<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.080> because<00:01:13.680> I<00:01:13.710> think

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
that I want to stop in because I think

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.310 
that I want to stop in because I think
this<00:01:14.369> is<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.580> huge<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.509> this<00:01:15.840> is<00:01:16.020> a<00:01:16.049> new

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
this is very huge this this is a new

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.499 
this is very huge this this is a new
thing<00:01:16.680> that<00:01:16.740> has<00:01:17.460> been<00:01:17.640> added<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.150> see<00:01:18.360> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
thing that has been added and see the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.260 
thing that has been added and see the
defender<00:01:19.080> reaching<00:01:19.920> out<00:01:20.100> with<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.640> stick<00:01:21.030> to

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
defender reaching out with a stick to

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.649 
defender reaching out with a stick to
stop<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.869> one-timer<00:01:22.380> from<00:01:22.680> happening<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.659> if

the<00:01:24.869> one-timer<00:01:25.290> had<00:01:25.530> occurred<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:26.850> would

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
the one-timer had occurred that would

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.300 
the one-timer had occurred that would
almost<00:01:27.330> be<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.689> definite<00:01:28.140> goal<00:01:28.380> but<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.070> never

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
almost be a definite goal but this never

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.999 
almost be a definite goal but this never
used<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.700> happen<00:01:29.880> in<00:01:30.119> HL<00:01:30.479> 15<00:01:30.930> most<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.650> the<00:01:31.740> time

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
used to happen in HL 15 most of the time

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.399 
used to happen in HL 15 most of the time
the<00:01:32.340> puck<00:01:32.549> would<00:01:32.729> just<00:01:33.000> magically<00:01:33.750> goes

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the puck would just magically goes

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.410 
the puck would just magically goes
straight<00:01:34.829> through<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.220> taken<00:01:35.640> onto<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.299> one

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
straight through is taken onto the one

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.690 
straight through is taken onto the one
timer<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.290> goal<00:01:37.650> would<00:01:37.799> be<00:01:37.860> scored<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.579> I'm

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
timer and a goal would be scored so I'm

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
timer and a goal would be scored so I'm
really<00:01:38.939> glad<00:01:39.210> that<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:39.840> has<00:01:40.079> been<00:01:40.350> fixed<00:01:40.590> for

NHL 16 so on this upcoming clip watch
the<00:01:44.939> left<00:01:45.180> winger<00:01:45.570> as<00:01:45.840> he's<00:01:46.020> gonna<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> full

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
the left winger as he's gonna do a full

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.639 
the left winger as he's gonna do a full
360<00:01:47.280> turn<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.270> this<00:01:48.780> used<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.140> happen<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.560> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
360 turn and this used to happen in the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.929 
360 turn and this used to happen in the
NHL<00:01:49.979> 15<00:01:51.470> now<00:01:52.470> these<00:01:52.770> are<00:01:53.070> minor<00:01:53.399> things<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
NHL 15 now these are minor things and

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.120 
NHL 15 now these are minor things and
can<00:01:54.270> easily<00:01:54.509> be<00:01:54.750> faced<00:01:55.200> but<00:01:55.439> different<00:01:55.920> if

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
can easily be faced but different if

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.340 
can easily be faced but different if
they're<00:01:56.369> an<00:01:56.460> off<00:01:56.640> fix<00:01:56.969> then<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.899> could<00:01:58.140> lead<00:01:58.320> to

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
they're an off fix then it could lead to

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.060 
they're an off fix then it could lead to
major<00:01:58.619> problems<00:01:59.340> so<00:01:59.549> imagine<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.950> a

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
major problems so imagine if it's a

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.459 
major problems so imagine if it's a
two-on-one<00:02:02.460> you're<00:02:03.390> the<00:02:03.570> only<00:02:03.810> defender<00:02:04.320> and

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
two-on-one you're the only defender and
