00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
people that have always dreamt about

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.880 
people that have always dreamt about
living<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.700> sea-doo<00:01:59.969> life<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.600> now<00:02:00.990> it's<00:02:01.770> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
living the sea-doo life and now it's a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.800 
living the sea-doo life and now it's a
product<00:02:02.369> that<00:02:02.549> makes<00:02:02.759> it<00:02:02.880> accessible<00:02:03.240> to<00:02:03.509> them

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
product that makes it accessible to them

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.139 
product that makes it accessible to them
but<00:02:04.350> not<00:02:04.530> just<00:02:04.770> accessibility<00:02:05.670> as<00:02:05.759> far<00:02:05.969> as

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
but not just accessibility as far as

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.749 
but not just accessibility as far as
price<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.170> also<00:02:07.320> its<00:02:07.590> size<00:02:07.829> I<00:02:08.190> mean<00:02:08.399> people

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
price but also its size I mean people

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.150 
price but also its size I mean people
don't<00:02:08.849> have<00:02:09.090> to<00:02:09.270> buy<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> new<00:02:09.750> tow<00:02:10.140> vehicle<00:02:10.649> to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
don't have to buy a new tow vehicle to

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.450 
don't have to buy a new tow vehicle to
pull<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> spark<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:11.940> mean<00:02:12.090> any

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.460 
pull a spark I mean any

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.580 
pull a spark I mean any
any<00:02:12.610> small<00:02:12.940> car<00:02:13.270> can<00:02:13.900> really<00:02:14.170> pull<00:02:14.410> this

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
any small car can really pull this

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.710 
any small car can really pull this
around<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.130> also<00:02:15.250> storage<00:02:15.910> since<00:02:16.480> it's

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
around and also storage since it's

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:18.690 
around and also storage since it's
smaller<00:02:17.020> and<00:02:17.290> lighter<00:02:17.500> it's<00:02:18.040> easier<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.550> put

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
smaller and lighter it's easier to put

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.370 
smaller and lighter it's easier to put
in<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:18.970> a<00:02:19.060> garage<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.660> you're<00:02:19.750> not<00:02:19.900> taking<00:02:20.260> up

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
in in a garage and you're not taking up

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.320 
in in a garage and you're not taking up
the<00:02:20.500> whole<00:02:20.530> garage<00:02:20.920> space<00:02:21.160> so<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.000> sparks

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
the whole garage space so the sparks

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.060 
the whole garage space so the sparks
really<00:02:22.390> a<00:02:22.660> unique<00:02:23.140> product<00:02:23.500> and<00:02:23.830> we<00:02:23.980> are

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
really a unique product and we are

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.340 
really a unique product and we are
targeting<00:02:24.370> and<00:02:24.760> we<00:02:24.850> still<00:02:25.120> are<00:02:25.150> targeting<00:02:25.780> to

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
targeting and we still are targeting to

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.370 
targeting and we still are targeting to
that<00:02:26.620> young<00:02:26.950> family<00:02:27.490> who<00:02:28.110> they're<00:02:29.110> just

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
that young family who they're just

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.980 
that young family who they're just
getting<00:02:29.770> maybe<00:02:30.430> they<00:02:30.640> grew<00:02:30.850> up<00:02:31.120> boating<00:02:31.810> and

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:31.990 
getting maybe they grew up boating and

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:34.740 
getting maybe they grew up boating and
grew<00:02:32.170> up<00:02:32.290> on<00:02:32.440> the<00:02:32.530> water<00:02:33.330> but<00:02:34.330> they<00:02:34.480> just

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
grew up on the water but they just

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.230 
grew up on the water but they just
weren't<00:02:35.320> able<00:02:35.590> for<00:02:35.980> whatever<00:02:36.190> reason<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:37.030> have

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:37.240 
weren't able for whatever reason to have

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.960 
weren't able for whatever reason to have
a<00:02:37.270> full-size<00:02:38.140> CD<00:02:39.040> watercraft<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.790> now<00:02:39.910> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
a full-size CD watercraft so now the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.660 
a full-size CD watercraft so now the
spark<00:02:40.390> is<00:02:40.570> really<00:02:40.930> designed<00:02:41.140> for<00:02:41.530> them<00:02:41.740> but

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:42.670 
spark is really designed for them but

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.140 
spark is really designed for them but
since<00:02:42.970> its<00:02:43.180> small<00:02:43.450> and<00:02:43.960> lightweight<00:02:44.350> and

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
since its small and lightweight and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.240 
since its small and lightweight and
relatively<00:02:46.150> inexpensive<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:47.620> enthusiasts

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
relatively inexpensive the enthusiasts

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.880 
relatively inexpensive the enthusiasts
love<00:02:48.430> it<00:02:48.610> too<00:02:48.760> so<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.480> lot<00:02:49.960> of<00:02:49.990> the<00:02:50.170> enthusiasts

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
love it too so a lot of the enthusiasts

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.060 
love it too so a lot of the enthusiasts
that<00:02:50.920> follow<00:02:51.310> the<00:02:51.550> sport<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.090> and<00:02:52.210> follow<00:02:53.070> the

that follow the sport and and follow the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.420 
that follow the sport and and follow the
media<00:02:54.400> like<00:02:55.030> watercraft<00:02:55.600> Rider<00:02:56.430> they're

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
media like watercraft Rider they're

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.420 
media like watercraft Rider they're
learning<00:02:57.730> about<00:02:58.030> the<00:02:58.710> product<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.860> they<00:03:00.190> fell

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
learning about the product and they fell

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.560 
learning about the product and they fell
in<00:03:00.460> love<00:03:00.580> with<00:03:00.880> it<00:03:00.970> because<00:03:01.060> it's<00:03:01.390> what

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:01.570 
in love with it because it's what

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.910 
in love with it because it's what
they've<00:03:01.750> been<00:03:01.870> asking<00:03:02.080> for<00:03:02.530> because<00:03:02.680> it's

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
they've been asking for because it's

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.210 
they've been asking for because it's
reminiscent<00:03:03.400> of<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:04.420> earlier<00:03:05.220> runabout

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
reminiscent of the earlier runabout

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.400 
reminiscent of the earlier runabout
models<00:03:06.610> it's<00:03:06.850> smaller<00:03:07.150> lighter<00:03:07.540> so<00:03:08.290> they

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
models it's smaller lighter so they

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.280 
models it's smaller lighter so they
gobbled<00:03:08.800> a<00:03:08.860> lot<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.190> them<00:03:09.340> up<00:03:09.490> so<00:03:10.000> in<00:03:10.150> 2015<00:03:11.110> we

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
gobbled a lot of them up so in 2015 we

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.620 
gobbled a lot of them up so in 2015 we
are<00:03:11.320> ramping<00:03:11.740> up<00:03:12.010> production<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:13.150> meet<00:03:13.390> that

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630 
are ramping up production to meet that

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:15.900 
are ramping up production to meet that
demand<00:03:14.040> because<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.130> were<00:03:15.190> almost<00:03:15.340> sold<00:03:15.760> out

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
demand because we were almost sold out

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.210 
demand because we were almost sold out
by<00:03:16.210> by<00:03:16.660> July<00:03:17.050> last<00:03:17.320> year<00:03:17.500> but<00:03:17.950> this<00:03:18.160> year

by by July last year but this year

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.610 
by by July last year but this year
there'll<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.180> enough<00:03:19.600> sparks<00:03:19.990> for<00:03:20.140> everybody

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
there'll be enough sparks for everybody

that<00:03:35.230> we<00:03:35.380> saved<00:03:35.790> because<00:03:36.790> we<00:03:37.000> knew<00:03:37.240> it<00:03:37.390> was

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
that we saved because we knew it was

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.110 
that we saved because we knew it was
coming<00:03:37.600> and<00:03:38.080> we<00:03:38.200> were<00:03:38.320> excited<00:03:38.860> so<00:03:39.760> we<00:03:39.910> knew

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:40.120 
coming and we were excited so we knew

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.750 
coming and we were excited so we knew
there<00:03:40.420> was<00:03:40.570> an<00:03:40.750> audience<00:03:41.260> of<00:03:41.760> enthusiasts

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
there was an audience of enthusiasts

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.580 
there was an audience of enthusiasts
that<00:03:42.880> the<00:03:43.120> spark<00:03:43.480> was<00:03:43.660> going<00:03:43.900> to<00:03:43.960> be<00:03:44.050> attracted

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
that the spark was going to be attracted

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.000 
that the spark was going to be attracted
to<00:03:45.600> with<00:03:46.600> the<00:03:46.720> high<00:03:46.870> horsepower<00:03:47.380> numbers<00:03:47.680> that

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
to with the high horsepower numbers that

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.350 
to with the high horsepower numbers that
are<00:03:48.160> out<00:03:48.190> there<00:03:48.310> right<00:03:48.610> now<00:03:48.640> we<00:03:48.850> weren't<00:03:49.150> sure

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
are out there right now we weren't sure

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.570

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.470 
how exactly how they were going to think
about<00:03:51.940> this<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.570> smaller<00:03:52.960> Rotax<00:03:53.650> ace<00:03:54.480> engine

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
about this the smaller Rotax ace engine

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.320 
about this the smaller Rotax ace engine
but<00:03:55.870> they<00:03:56.140> ended<00:03:56.350> up<00:03:56.470> obviously<00:03:57.250> they<00:03:57.700> love<00:03:58.180> it

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
but they ended up obviously they love it

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.720 
but they ended up obviously they love it
and<00:03:58.480> it's<00:03:58.720> really<00:03:59.050> it's<00:03:59.620> because<00:04:00.100> it's<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.400> fun
