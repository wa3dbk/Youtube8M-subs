00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.560 
long one we did have visitors while we

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.370 
long one we did have visitors while we
were<00:00:18.710> building<00:00:18.949> the<00:00:19.940> barbecue<00:00:20.810> and<00:00:21.080> that<00:00:21.259> was

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
were building the barbecue and that was

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.200 
were building the barbecue and that was
in<00:00:21.500> the<00:00:21.589> form<00:00:21.769> of<00:00:21.859> three<00:00:22.220> camels<00:00:22.519> out<00:00:22.910> of

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210 
in the form of three camels out of

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.650 
in the form of three camels out of
nowhere

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
nowhere

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.269 
nowhere
although<00:00:24.019> biology<00:00:26.589> basically<00:00:27.589> I<00:00:27.800> was<00:00:28.039> really

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:28.279 
although biology basically I was really

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:30.040 
although biology basically I was really
excited<00:00:28.579> about<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.119> prospect<00:00:29.570> of<00:00:29.689> a

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
excited about the prospect of a

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.899 
excited about the prospect of a
solar-powered<00:00:30.380> barbecue<00:00:31.039> the<00:00:31.189> ID<00:00:31.369> cook<00:00:31.730> up

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:31.909 
solar-powered barbecue the ID cook up

00:00:31.909 --> 00:00:34.930 
solar-powered barbecue the ID cook up
200<00:00:32.450> looked<00:00:32.689> on<00:00:32.930> paper<00:00:33.530> like<00:00:33.890> it<00:00:34.190> would<00:00:34.489> be<00:00:34.730> a

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
200 looked on paper like it would be a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.160 
200 looked on paper like it would be a
brilliant<00:00:35.270> idea

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
brilliant idea

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.740 
brilliant idea
it<00:00:36.410> promises<00:00:37.070> cooking<00:00:37.490> temperatures<00:00:38.000> of<00:00:38.210> 200

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
it promises cooking temperatures of 200

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.990 
it promises cooking temperatures of 200

the focus the sun's rays on a central
point<00:00:44.020> we<00:00:45.020> were<00:00:45.140> probably<00:00:45.320> in<00:00:45.560> one<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:45.710> the

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
point we were probably in one of the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.050 
point we were probably in one of the
best<00:00:45.890> locations<00:00:46.130> on<00:00:46.400> earth<00:00:46.430> to<00:00:46.760> test<00:00:46.970> the

best locations on earth to test the

best locations on earth to test the
sella<00:00:47.240> barbecue<00:00:47.720> it<00:00:48.380> was<00:00:48.650> hot<00:00:48.860> it<00:00:49.220> was<00:00:49.250> it<00:00:50.120> was

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
sella barbecue it was hot it was it was

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.250 
sella barbecue it was hot it was it was
definitely<00:00:50.780> 35<00:00:51.590> plus<00:00:52.540> for<00:00:53.540> most<00:00:53.720> of<00:00:53.840> the<00:00:53.900> day<00:00:54.080> a

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
definitely 35 plus for most of the day a

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.500 
definitely 35 plus for most of the day a
touch<00:00:54.620> 40<00:00:54.950> at<00:00:55.190> one<00:00:55.310> point<00:00:55.550> I<00:00:55.910> was<00:00:56.390> really

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:56.510 
touch 40 at one point I was really

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.090 
touch 40 at one point I was really
excited<00:00:57.110> about<00:00:57.170> this<00:00:57.470> we<00:00:57.650> thought<00:00:57.830> we'd<00:00:57.950> leave

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
excited about this we thought we'd leave

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.800 
excited about this we thought we'd leave
it<00:00:58.280> for<00:00:58.430> a<00:00:58.460> little<00:00:58.610> while<00:00:58.730> obviously<00:00:59.210> that<00:00:59.660> it

00:00:59.800 --> 00:00:59.810 
it for a little while obviously that it

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.500 
it for a little while obviously that it
reflects<00:01:00.470> the<00:01:00.680> energy<00:01:00.830> and<00:01:01.430> in<00:01:01.790> theory<00:01:02.270> this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
reflects the energy and in theory this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.570 
reflects the energy and in theory this
was<00:01:02.750> when<00:01:02.900> things<00:01:03.230> should<00:01:03.320> start<00:01:04.070> hotting<00:01:04.460> up

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580 
was when things should start hotting up

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.330 
was when things should start hotting up
but<00:01:05.239> we<00:01:05.449> were<00:01:05.570> still<00:01:05.780> missing<00:01:06.200> one<00:01:06.229> thing<00:01:06.439> the

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
but we were still missing one thing the

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.580 
but we were still missing one thing the

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:34.249 
I think it would have struggled to find

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:38.289 
I think it would have struggled to find
egg<00:01:34.700> let<00:01:35.149> alone<00:01:35.389> you<00:01:36.350> know<00:01:36.499> lambs<00:01:36.859> brains<00:01:37.299> it

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:38.299 
egg let alone you know lambs brains it

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:48.669 
egg let alone you know lambs brains it
was<00:01:38.659> rubbish<00:01:39.469> I<00:01:40.039> am<00:01:40.429> absolutely<00:01:41.299> shocked<00:01:47.679> that

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
was rubbish I am absolutely shocked that

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:50.830 
was rubbish I am absolutely shocked that
miner<00:01:49.310> flies<00:01:49.609> on<00:01:49.789> the<00:01:49.819> brain<00:01:50.090> that's<00:01:50.630> just

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
miner flies on the brain that's just

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.660 
miner flies on the brain that's just
that's<00:01:51.409> just<00:01:51.590> that<00:01:51.770> sort<00:01:52.039> of<00:01:52.100> flavor<00:01:52.340> a<00:01:52.520> few

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
that's just that sort of flavor a few

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.870 
that's just that sort of flavor a few
flies<00:01:52.909> in<00:01:53.149> there<00:01:53.329> so<00:01:54.200> it's<00:01:54.469> a<00:01:54.649> humiliating<00:01:55.340> one

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:55.880

G for the ID cooker it may have great

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.789 
G for the ID cooker it may have great
eco<00:01:58.700> potentials<00:01:59.299> but<00:01:59.539> at<00:01:59.869> the<00:01:59.990> barbecue<00:02:00.530> it

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
eco potentials but at the barbecue it

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.329 
eco potentials but at the barbecue it
was<00:02:00.920> all<00:02:01.039> fizzle<00:02:01.429> and<00:02:01.579> no<00:02:01.909> sizzle
