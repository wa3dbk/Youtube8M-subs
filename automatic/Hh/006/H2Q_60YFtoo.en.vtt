 then we can start from 20 here 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.830
 then there are pounds and here we can 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.440
 change the currency then for example 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.850

 we can see we have 73 0 73 dollars or 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.020

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.550
 we want 50 if we suddenly want 75 thousand 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.370
 then here 80 then we want 80 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.680

 open it or do it with paypal which is the 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.019
 easiest way and the truth then of this 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:24.440
 way I do it is a very easy account 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:26.990

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:54.310
 a coffee we are going to think that we are going to 

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:56.830
 do this we buy it 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.780

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.330
 here to wait for us to buy our 

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.120
 player 

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:06.419
 we ended up good friends now we enter 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:08.550
 to fifa and we can see click 

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:12.889
 it took about 10-15 minutes in 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:14.840
 give us the coins per click 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.180
 the first time you buy green is 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:20.810
 that was fleeting that is 12 minutes 

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.779
 then you can see them 80 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.150
 thousand coins we already have million 30 like 

00:06:23.779 --> 00:06:28.699
 you can see, I was quick, it was 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:31.219
 reliable is economically obviously the 

00:06:28.699 --> 00:06:32.810
 prices sometimes go down a lot so 

00:06:31.219 --> 00:06:35.110
 you can be aware that the 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.389
 prices are lowering prices 

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:41.810
 constantly as it goes they are reducing 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:43.669
 and nothing because that was a tutorial something 

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:45.289
 basic the truth is that it is simple not 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:47.210
 It has many obstacles 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:49.699
 complications then have the link 

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:51.949
 in the description with the code 5 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.020
 percent discount and nothing then 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.189
 I hope you liked it and we 'll see each other 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.189
