00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 ah 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.660
 well I started skating four years ago 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.870
 years when I lived in the city of Iquique 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.240
 they did a skatepark and it just came to me 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:19.410
 study to Santiago for the first time I saw 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 as a group of men skating but 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.440
 they were different skates were like 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.440
 thicker bigger heavy 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.770
 I've always liked to criticize a lot 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.550
 sports since I was a girl I've gone through the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.380
 Athletics 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.140
 the same model was the selection of 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.920
 college after more than bolt also 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.410
 I played in football as in the average 9 came 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 to santiago and it was a time I like 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:03.130
 practice breakdance and afterwards I 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.130
 motivated with the skates and meye just that 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.360
 since 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:03.770
 constancy is the most important thing as 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.370
 master the body 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.770
 that relationship between physics 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.300
 because you have to think the same 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.220
 progress 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.970
 how to understand it is not how to get there and 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.600
 pull out of the room like a 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.350
 exercise of thinking about me when I skated 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.440
 forgetfulness of all 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.540
 to enter another world of music and I 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.310
 I let carry I like to do routines or 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.990
 do a trick on several sides without stopping 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:32.270
 then it 's like being in a movie 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.600
 with music like that I feel when 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.600
 skated 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.930
 I like challenges and I started to climb 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.830
 the level of getting tricks done 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.959
 constants and hours to skate all day 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.120
 but the moment I saw that that gave 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.800
 fruits when you start to win 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.520
 championships 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:03.590
 the truth that was never a never me what 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.590
 I put as mediators it was given alone 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.040
 good one of the experiences that has 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.320
 been more important to me in terms of 

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:46.150
 championship was one of the first 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.790
 big championships that I went and compete 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.680
 with men in ecuador when I knew that 

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.060
 there was no female category and that was 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:53.390
 enrolled with a man and he gave me a lot 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.639
 scare 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:59.849
 good for you neisse the best I could 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:02.219
 at the time of classification to the other 

00:04:59.849 --> 00:05:05.479
 day I realized that I had stayed and that 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:09.409
 it was the final we were the four 

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:09.409
 South American beginners 

00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:22.740
 each championship one that you learn a lot 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.990
 like all the tricks I had 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.670
 remain forever in your memory and you 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.910
 turn to another level that's why it's good 

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.910
 to compete 

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:47.690
 the first thing we did with the cuca for 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.310
 motivate the girls because they knew each other 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.009
 the sport on the feminine side because 

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.389
 watch videos of men to one the incentive 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.740
 but it's not the same as you come from a 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:59.960
 girl and we started recording to upload photos 

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:02.300
 to contact more women 

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.280
 we showed facebook as well as advertising 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.410
 of ourselves and little by little we 

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.150
 started adding more people after we 

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.849
 we realized that there were more children and 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.020
 more small female championships and 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:17.229
 with support from small brands and that was 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.000
 that the feminine zones were shown 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.069
 but we also did not realize that 

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.960
 they were creating female groups of 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:25.849
 roles in other countries equal that 

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:29.120
 we did we started 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:32.240
 exchange information 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:35.030
 and the first thing that threw us the most 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:37.610
 foreigner was that ball without sounding a 

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:39.590
 professional skater usa saw our 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.900
 facebook and he wrote us and said that he 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.530
 like to go skating with us and 

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:47.389
 she paid for her passage and came to each site 

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:51.310
 we did a championship to receive it in 

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:51.310
 that championship we put the whole tub 

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:04.400
 Well now I'm finishing the 

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:08.949
 college 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.660
 I want to contribute to the sport with what 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:14.910
 study photography 

00:07:11.660 --> 00:07:16.770
 with that photograph 

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:19.110
 I want to make a sports magazine 

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:21.510
 feminine extreme I think it's missing 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:24.360
 show up then I want to generate that 

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:28.010
 space for the scene to be seen 

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:28.010
 female of general in chile
