 his views on the great

 political battle that is being waged in

 Venezuela

 fidelity has been reflected so 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:41.140
 clearly a struggle of ideas between the 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.700
 capitalism and socialism like the one that 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.210
 is expressed in venezuela 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.129

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.320

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.659
 the act of yesterday with the children to 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.239
 The start of the new school year was 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.190
 really wonderful a show 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.689
 unique in the world that the figures 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.960
 statistics expressed through the 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:10.299
 progress achieved year by year emphasizes the 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.520
 fact that only in the course that 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.770
 corresponded with the coup d'etat of 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 the bourgeois and reactionary right 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.659
 produced a decline in the booming advance 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.850
 of education in venezuela that the 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.479
 Bolivarian revolution brought that 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:28.750

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.789
 follower of the liberator of america in 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:36.850

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.190
 expressions your behavior is inspired without 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.630
 a day of rest for many years 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.759
 for me that from a forced retirement 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.590
 imposed by age and health 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:49.780
 He observed in detail the 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.600
 events of our world do not 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 There is no doubt about the results 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.250
 of that titanic 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.920
 and later says 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:10.869
 returning to the Venezuelan reality 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.290
 where you with admirable effort are looking 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:19.920

 so long the people victim of the abuse 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:33.970
 and the exploitation of the powers 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:37.000
 colonialists and imperialists assimilate the 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:39.760
 principles of socialism despite the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.640
 reactionary ideas sown during 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:46.650
 more than a century and a half and imposed by 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.650
 strength in your heroic country 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:03:02.239
