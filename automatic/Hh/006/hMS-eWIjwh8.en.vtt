00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:09.870
 hello today we are going to talk about receipt 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:11.430
 but for that we have to go back to 2012 on 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.400
 last year in which three came out 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.080
 sound games revelations operation 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.029
 raccoon city ​​that everyone considered 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.770
 that was the lousy price level 6 that 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.750
 everyone expected it to be the game of 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.689
 year but disappoints a lot because he had 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.400
 too much action as a result the best 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.109
 game last year's version was 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 revelations the problem is that only 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.949
 came out for nintendo 3ds the good news 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 is that this week has already come out and is 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.530
 available for pc xbox playstation and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.530
 wii 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.800
 the story takes place between greece 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.880
 level 4 and 5 lizbeth who has been 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.150
 kidnapped by an organization 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:50.070
 terrorist for what they are worth time and their 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.270
 new partner parker will have to go to 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.800
 rescue him 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.690
 this is eventually carried by a ship 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.430
 ghost that as expected is 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.680
 full of infected mutant creatures 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.960
 by the ted virus and things get a 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.309
 little ugly in addition they count the 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.560
 experiences of various other characters 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.270
 whose plots finally cross 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.040
 the truth is that they are not very 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.590
 deep but they are enough 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.270
 entertaining to hang out the best 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.070
 of this installment is that the series finally 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.020
 returns to its origins to what it sees without 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.899
 no you go out to the best that is to put you 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.659
 in enclosed places give you few 

00:01:19.899 --> 00:01:24.909
 ammunition and lasarte and others who want 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.920
 eat your head 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.039
 The advantage of being on a boat is that 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.659
 there are many corridors and closed places 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:33.460
 this combined with the strange rivers 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.179
 they create the perfect environment to give us 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.179
 some scares 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.909
 so imagine you're going to the 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.430
 the bathroom after I have to pee and 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.170
 nothing comes out a monster and he shoots him in the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.170
 head or whatever it is for him to die 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.229
 the people who are going to wash your clothes 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.740
 what makes me happy is that the 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.600
 transition of the screen girl of 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.510
 nintendo 3ds to televisions and monitors 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.010
 has been almost perfect and let's admit it 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.440
 you need super graphics to 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.690
 scare you used the same engine 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.400
 graphic with which it was created recent 15 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.380
 so the game looks good and runs 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.610
 fluid the only thing do not wait to see the last 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.610
 generation in details 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:29.370
 but what makes it stand out the most 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.560
 newly alive reflect are the sounds and 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.700
 the soundtrack that is possibly a 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.700
 of the best in the franchise 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.400
 another difference in this game is that the 

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:45.709
 monsters are made from water 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.930
 so enemies can appear in 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.239
 any part and the voices are also 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.099
 grotesquely cool some other 

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.099
 I might give you some nightmares 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.030
 It will take 10 or 12 hours to finish the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.470
 new campaign but then they can go back to 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.840
 play it in the infernal world where there 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.209
 more enemies and they seem to be 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.440
 hallucinations of the characters besides 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.819
 has a multiplayer mode that 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.819
 will have entertained for several weeks 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.550
 I know that fans already know it 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:17.380
 franchise has to get this 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.020
 game and for others if they are looking 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:22.240
 some suspense and they are not very 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:24.990
 claustrophobic president- revelations 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.990
 It is a very good alternative
