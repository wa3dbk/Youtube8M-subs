it's not going to do its job anymore so

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.980 
it's not going to do its job anymore so
that<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.790> quite<00:01:56.939> interesting<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.570> find<00:01:57.719> out

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that was quite interesting to find out

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.830 
that was quite interesting to find out
another<00:01:58.829> thing<00:01:59.040> I<00:01:59.189> found<00:01:59.369> out<00:01:59.610> is<00:01:59.790> that<00:01:59.880> SPF

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
another thing I found out is that SPF

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.230 
another thing I found out is that SPF
the<00:02:01.500> higher<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.950> SPF<00:02:02.100> it<00:02:02.579> doesn't<00:02:02.909> mean<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the higher the SPF it doesn't mean the

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.910 
the higher the SPF it doesn't mean the
more<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.540> protects<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.439> doesn't<00:02:04.710> mean

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
more it protects you it doesn't mean

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.350 
more it protects you it doesn't mean
it's<00:02:05.100> double<00:02:05.399> protection<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.969> just

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
it's double protection it just

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.240 
it's double protection it just
it's<00:02:06.780> going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.260> be<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.410> thicker<00:02:07.680> layer<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
it's going to be a thicker layer that

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.219 
it's going to be a thicker layer that
last<00:02:08.460> that<00:02:08.640> little<00:02:08.910> bit<00:02:09.000> longer<00:02:09.210> still<00:02:09.990> means

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
last that little bit longer still means

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.140 
last that little bit longer still means
you<00:02:10.410> have<00:02:10.560> to<00:02:10.680> apply<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.040> same<00:02:11.280> amount<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.700> it

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
you have to apply the same amount so it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.880 
you have to apply the same amount so it
doesn't<00:02:12.480> mean<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:12.750> double<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.650> protection

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
doesn't mean it's double the protection

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.110 
doesn't mean it's double the protection
of<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:15.500> 25<00:02:16.500> it<00:02:16.890> just<00:02:17.460> means<00:02:17.640> it's<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.850> bit<00:02:18.000> more

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
of a 25 it just means it's a bit more

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.340 
of a 25 it just means it's a bit more
it's<00:02:18.270> going<00:02:18.360> to<00:02:18.420> reflect<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:18.960> bit<00:02:19.170> more

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
it's going to reflect a little bit more

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.340 
it's going to reflect a little bit more
and<00:02:19.670> obviously<00:02:20.670> when<00:02:21.120> you<00:02:21.210> put<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.450> on<00:02:21.570> wait<00:02:22.110> 2

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
and obviously when you put it on wait 2

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.860 
and obviously when you put it on wait 2
hours<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.920> then<00:02:23.040> reapply<00:02:23.460> and<00:02:23.820> I<00:02:24.240> would<00:02:24.690> say

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
hours and then reapply and I would say

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.230 
hours and then reapply and I would say

thing is if you apply this twice doesn't

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:03.680 
thing is if you apply this twice doesn't
mean<00:03:02.100> you're<00:03:02.340> going<00:03:02.490> to<00:03:02.550> get<00:03:02.730> double<00:03:03.510> that

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
mean you're going to get double that

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.600 
mean you're going to get double that
protection<00:03:04.050> it's<00:03:04.740> actually<00:03:05.190> going<00:03:05.340> to<00:03:05.430> break

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
protection it's actually going to break

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.820 
protection it's actually going to break
it<00:03:05.760> down<00:03:05.790> and<00:03:06.120> dilute<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.600> if<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.230> have<00:03:07.440> an<00:03:07.590> SPF

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
it down and dilute it if you have an SPF

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.670 
it down and dilute it if you have an SPF
of<00:03:08.220> 15<00:03:08.700> on<00:03:08.940> your<00:03:09.090> face<00:03:09.540> on<00:03:09.780> your<00:03:09.840> daily<00:03:10.380> face

of 15 on your face on your daily face

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.370 
of 15 on your face on your daily face
moisturizer<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.610> then<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.209> put<00:03:12.450> an<00:03:12.660> SPF<00:03:13.260> of

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
moisturizer and then you put an SPF of

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.560 
moisturizer and then you put an SPF of
50<00:03:13.800> on<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:13.950> it's<00:03:14.550> not<00:03:14.880> going<00:03:15.060> to<00:03:15.150> double<00:03:15.480> up

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
50 on it it's not going to double up

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.270 
50 on it it's not going to double up
again<00:03:15.870> you're<00:03:16.080> not<00:03:16.230> going<00:03:16.410> to<00:03:16.500> have<00:03:16.620> an<00:03:16.739> SPF<00:03:17.160> of

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
again you're not going to have an SPF of

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.660 
again you're not going to have an SPF of
65<00:03:17.850> because<00:03:18.300> it's<00:03:18.540> diluting<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.170> down<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:20.190> it's

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
65 because it's diluting it down so it's

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.240 
65 because it's diluting it down so it's
very<00:03:21.000> complicated<00:03:21.570> but<00:03:21.959> it's<00:03:22.350> not<00:03:22.650> going<00:03:23.010> to

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
very complicated but it's not going to

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:24.830 
very complicated but it's not going to
add<00:03:23.430> together<00:03:23.910> because<00:03:24.330> actually<00:03:24.660> they're

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
add together because actually they're

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.290 
add together because actually they're
broken<00:03:25.019> each<00:03:25.230> other<00:03:25.470> down<00:03:25.739> so<00:03:26.340> a<00:03:26.370> sunblock<00:03:26.940> is

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
broken each other down so a sunblock is

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.780 
broken each other down so a sunblock is
going<00:03:27.690> to<00:03:27.930> reflect<00:03:28.380> the<00:03:28.709> Rays<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.160> a<00:03:29.519> Sun

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
going to reflect the Rays and a Sun

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.150 
going to reflect the Rays and a Sun
lotion<00:03:30.060> usually<00:03:31.019> designed<00:03:31.410> to<00:03:31.709> accelerate

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:32.160 
lotion usually designed to accelerate

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.650 
lotion usually designed to accelerate
with<00:03:33.150> little<00:03:33.810> or<00:03:34.050> no<00:03:34.860> protection<00:03:35.660> that's

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
with little or no protection that's

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.449 
with little or no protection that's
quite<00:03:36.870> scary<00:03:36.989> so<00:03:37.380> some<00:03:37.709> block<00:03:37.950> is<00:03:38.100> going<00:03:38.310> to

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
quite scary so some block is going to

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.479 
quite scary so some block is going to
block<00:03:39.060> out<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.300> Sun<00:03:39.600> a<00:03:39.810> Sun<00:03:40.260> lotion<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.980> going

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
block out the Sun a Sun lotion is going

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.540 
block out the Sun a Sun lotion is going
to<00:03:41.580> just<00:03:41.760> slowly<00:03:42.090> tan<00:03:42.510> you<00:03:43.310> right<00:03:44.310> let<00:03:44.459> me

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
to just slowly tan you right let me

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.940 
to just slowly tan you right let me
break<00:03:44.760> down<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.330> have<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.510> UV<00:03:45.780> a<00:03:46.140> rays

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
break down you have a UV a rays

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.120 
break down you have a UV a rays
ultraviolet<00:03:47.730> rays<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:48.870> you<00:03:48.989> have<00:03:49.170> UVB

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
ultraviolet rays and then you have UVB

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.720 
ultraviolet rays and then you have UVB
ultraviolet<00:03:51.030> big<00:03:51.269> now<00:03:51.980> ultraviolet<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.070> is<00:03:53.519> the

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
ultraviolet big now ultraviolet a is the

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.420 
ultraviolet big now ultraviolet a is the
long-wave<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.660> ultraviolet<00:03:55.170> B<00:03:55.530> is<00:03:55.739> shortwave

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
long-wave and ultraviolet B is shortwave

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.990 
long-wave and ultraviolet B is shortwave
both<00:03:57.180> penetrate<00:03:58.080> the<00:03:58.590> atmosphere<00:03:58.620> and<00:03:59.400> can

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
both penetrate the atmosphere and can

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.020 
both penetrate the atmosphere and can
cause<00:04:00.300> skin<00:04:00.959> aging<00:04:01.560> eye<00:04:01.709> damage<00:04:02.459> and<00:04:02.670> skin

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
cause skin aging eye damage and skin

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.780 
cause skin aging eye damage and skin
cancer<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.840> both<00:04:04.140> are<00:04:04.380> bad<00:04:04.500> so<00:04:05.280> protect<00:04:05.670> your

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:05.790 
cancer so both are bad so protect your

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:08.570 
cancer so both are bad so protect your
skin<00:04:06.090> UVA<00:04:06.720> goes<00:04:07.140> deeper<00:04:07.739> into<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:08.250> skins

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
penetrates more deeply than UVB so UVA

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.900 
penetrates more deeply than UVB so UVA
is<00:04:12.870> what<00:04:13.049> gives<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.380> a<00:04:13.410> tan

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:41.990 
an indication of how long it would take

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.670 
an indication of how long it would take
for<00:04:42.200> the<00:04:42.440> UB<00:04:43.450> UVB<00:04:44.450> rays<00:04:44.870> to<00:04:45.170> start<00:04:45.410> penetrating

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:11.600 
you go skiing and that's just going to

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:13.630 
you go skiing and that's just going to
protect<00:05:11.930> that<00:05:12.080> sensitive<00:05:12.290> skin<00:05:12.830> a<00:05:12.950> little<00:05:13.370> bit

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
protect that sensitive skin a little bit

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.050 
protect that sensitive skin a little bit
more<00:05:14.320> and<00:05:15.320> I<00:05:15.440> think<00:05:15.470> that's<00:05:15.800> everything<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.460> I

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
more and I think that's everything and I

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.640 
more and I think that's everything and I
was<00:05:17.270> just<00:05:17.420> researching<00:05:17.720> it<00:05:18.050> so<00:05:18.170> I<00:05:18.200> thought<00:05:18.470> I'd

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:18.650 
was just researching it so I thought I'd

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.530 
was just researching it so I thought I'd
let<00:05:18.860> you<00:05:18.890> know<00:05:19.040> about<00:05:19.310> it<00:05:19.640> as<00:05:19.730> well<00:05:19.850> I<00:05:20.120> hope
