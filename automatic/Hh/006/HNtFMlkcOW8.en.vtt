00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.430
 the idea of â€‹â€‹this video that million in 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.960
 The truth was the net ebay of the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.849
 people there for twitter we were 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.410
 talking about new videos and he 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.059
 commented on the subject 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.099
 henrique was also recording a video 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.080
 him and after he records I think that 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.359
 I'm going to force my henry arms today. 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.550
 tomorrow and then I leave the link 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:22.850
 Sick video for you as soon as you pass. 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.850
 in the channel 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:30.920
 hello people, how are you? I'm friend of the 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.200
 time of the mini and how you should have 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.570
 seen in the title above the video of 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.300
 today is five books that I do not 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.290
 I indicate for reading what I mean 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.059
 thereby 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.730
 for example the show make a video with 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:46.120
 indications is always synonymous with what 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:48.950
 you can get involved in some controversy 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 but I 'll explain the reasons why 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.780
 I do not recommend consuming five books that 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.900
 I'm going to quote a video today and how 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.519
 Name says books that I do not indicate more 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.440
 You do not owe the law. 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:04.159
 are books I did not like for some 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.940
 reason and I think it's not worth reading 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.500
 so come on, I'll start by talking about 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.409
 two meters I do not have in my 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.020
 collection one company knows the other beautiful 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.970
 a library system will explain 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.670
 For you, the first book I go to 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.630
 talking on this video is the secret I gave 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.630
 his plate here 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.390
 so the secret was a book 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.610
 classified as self-help did much 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:37.270
 a few years ago if I did not 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.060
 mistake was in 2007 or 2008 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.130
 and I borrowed it at that time because 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.560
 I did not like the book, it's not online. 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.560
 relation to the free in ciel that many people 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.860
 the feeling that a lot of people stayed after 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.570
 read this book because the secret is that 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.210
 book that talks about thinking 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.799
 positive about you believing that 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.319
 that you wish 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:03.640
 but many people have become so attached 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:06.189
 this idea and they were only in the imagination 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.830
 in positive thinking I am one of those 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.410
 people who are more pessimistic and 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 that positivists lighter think 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.670
 important to think positive about 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.910
 issues that are important to 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:21.730
 our life but reconcile with attitudes 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:24.250
 to really come true 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.040
 the second book of the video when he 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.109
 I worked on leave had hail think 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.120
 that there is no more you could take two 

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:33.730
 books per month to read more or less 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.280
 like the library scheme and I got it 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.200
 a book called wanted so much if I did not 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.790
 The name of the author is a mistake, Brazil is free 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.790
 and I'll leave it to you too 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.870
 if I'm not mistaken in a femur in the 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.680
 publication gives good turn and I did not like it 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.910
 from this book 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.350
 basically the character is 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.280
 in love with a friend of hers and this one 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:03.220
 gay friend passes 80% of the book trying 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:54.600
 change that little face to stay with her and 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:54.600
 even all the logic going against what 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:29.290
 happens is a pretty character 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.790
 Appealing is I did not like the book 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:34.860
 no question 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:43.350
 still the expectation because I read the 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:43.350
 synopsis the author of television 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:05:04.289
 the next book 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:05:07.259
 He won the bike and New York gives this one. 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:12.770
 book was disappointing because the 100 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:15.770
 pages more or less of it and reading 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:15.770
 Facebook 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:32.339
 after that a bummer and one day I 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:06:44.699
 new 

00:05:32.339 --> 00:06:46.409
 bad was the following quite was the book 

00:06:44.699 --> 00:06:49.349
 that I took much longer than the 

00:06:46.409 --> 00:07:00.259
 normal to read because I was not with 

00:06:49.349 --> 00:07:00.259
 story and the characters of the story 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:05.740
 that you have throughout the book and this 

00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:08.979
 greatly affected the same overview 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:11.740
 reading at the end then ease and 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:14.410
 tomorrow then forget the five books 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:16.960
 this first edition of the did not indicate 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.880
