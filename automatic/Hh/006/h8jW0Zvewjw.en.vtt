00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.609
 hello to you i 'm going to talk to you about 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.150
 laulan bib 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:12.150
 this is the video games championship 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.830
 around the league of legend game that is 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 goes into the libraries of all the 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:19.050
 France and the principle is to do 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.460
 meet teams of players in 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.810
 each library and make them 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.779
 fight all year round 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.130
 thanks to meetings and thanks to 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.130
 championship that we put in place 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.480
 weight we made the choice of league 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.580
 of legend such as carrier 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.470
 of animation it's actually this 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.690
 who helps us that we liked the first 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.020
 first of all it's a fact that they're playing out 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.879
 in team 2 that it is played that they have 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.820
 a competitive spirit but also a 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.500
 mind I would say team strategy 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.180
 all alone one player can not do anything 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.920
 do so coming together 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:06.080
 in one place and communicate 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.780
 together develop a strategy some 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.590
 share me I use I present the 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:11.119
 media library as a place 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.580
 learning the game league of legends 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.470
 and tells them come learn the basics of 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.330
 will not learn farm and do last hit 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.550
 come learn how to communicate report 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.200
 when there are lines that are missing 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.210
 or yahoo there is a lack of filthy 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.039
 adversaries if you are not habib 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.600
 passed as if these communications from 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.780
 base not necessarily you would not move forward 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.710
 far away and the fact of the 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.660
 the experienced like that in a place where 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.890
 everyone is together ben necessarily 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.860
 progress much faster 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.899
 I have a lot of players there who have 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:40.750
 who started league of legend with 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.100
 we with the championship the Bible Bible 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.600
 who started because he saw the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.340
 biggest players in the championship 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.140
 and then very quickly very salty 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:49.610
 it made them want to progress they 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.890
 are already level 30 even already well 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.090
 classified so the goal was it was 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.660
 to install gaming in 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.880
 libraries to create places of 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.440
 friendliness of we know that today 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.630
 teens spend a lot of time playing 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.979
 and in their room and the idea too 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:05.599
 of the concept was to get them out 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.770
 from their room and make them come back 

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.349
 in a public place 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.340
 a library to install a 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:13.590
 comfort moment and two 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.720
 and communication also I like 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.470
 much the idea of ​​bringing out the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.180
 children from their rooms where we have 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.530
 the image often of the isolated player in his 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.879
 room with his helmet and his name 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.069
 in front of his computer 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.810
 there with the Bible Bible and especially with the 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.269
 game league of legend we had really 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.950
 the possibility of bringing them in 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.629
 the library and make them 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.890
 really part by sharing a moment 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.890
 pure competition 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.230
 for this first season 30 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:59.959
 library are part of the project 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.080
 have joined us and so we have some 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:07.099
 teams of players of very varied level 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.940
 level 10 to level silver plus level 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.810
 30 silver level more meaning on the move 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.750
 have already taken place 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.160
 so the championship started at the month 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.890
 from last october it will end at 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.390
 next June and so I think 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.430
 we will actually arrive 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.130
 easily that one hundred and twenty 120 steps 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.930
 on the whole picture k season the 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.890
 the goal is every time so 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.480
 of adp to win the most wins 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.150
 possible and more we cash two 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:37.489
 victories the more we collect points and 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.099
 at the end of the year the team that will have the 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.640
 more baritone points will be will 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:45.709
 winner of the championship in the goal and 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.750
 also walk away with the points 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:49.150
 scared of points they were 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.739
 graciously 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:54.489
 distributed by riot since we have 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:55.540
 submitted our championship project to 

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.430
 competitions 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.360
 we are already going the current teams we 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.079
 indicated that they wanted to re 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.400
 participate continue season 2 and 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.989
 great chances for others of 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.079
 especially in the Paris region 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:09.189
 because I was very surprised to have 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:10.359
 3,4 only three four structures of 

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:12.750
 Paris region registered 

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.780
 there we will I think this is more 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.780
 next year 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:25.290
 very often so we said everything to 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.220
 the time young people often play alone 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.620
 in their room are a bit isolated 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.660
 spent an hour or two hours a little 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.990
 more times on the way on games 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.790
 isolated 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.250
 coming to the libraries 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.740
 already beats that it allows young people to 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:40.320
 go out from home to play with 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.070
 other young people their age so to get 

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.650
 socializing 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.449
 we could say and then suddenly 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.400
 some talk the parents are 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.110
 reassured to see there finally their 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.650
 kids play too but in the 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.530
 media 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:55.560
 it also allows almost 2 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.530
 to establish a time I was going to say a 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.760
 time a time of arbitrations in fact there 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.440
 there is no negotiation with them 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:04.020
 parents and children at home 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.580
 there in fact young people come to play a 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:06.600
 hour or two hours the media library and 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.460
 that's all we know that once the 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.110
 assignment is complete and we leave the 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.220
 instead the other youth which there 

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:13.500
 no discussion possible no 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:15.720
 conflict can also since everything was 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:18.330
 really framed by the regulation of the 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.449
 library that side there parents are 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:24.630
 pretty reassured to see them play but in 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:26.070
 outside and then you but also from 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.470
 see open with do 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.150
 knowledge with others 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:30.740
 other friends of other young people I 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:33.710
 think that's all that that can 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.780
 reassure to follow the news of the 

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:38.840
 championship so is the official website where 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:43.220
 we will reference all teams 3 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:45.260
 w lol you would go and get the Bible point fr 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.250
 and you type laulan bible in google 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.670
 and you go all but directly 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.500
 above 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:50.990
 and then also there a facebook page 

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.490
 which will list all the results of 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.950
 hens and match it's really enough 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.110
 much more news teams with 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:58.820
 sometimes interviews of the players or 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.890
 animations happening in the 

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:05.930
 coming days to league of players 

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:08.450
 legends ben you have a media library 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.650
 which is equipped with a sufficiently 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.930
 computers and a connection 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.300
 internet important enough for 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.310
 network play you ride a team 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.530
 of five or more substitutes 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:20.750
 and you will see your librarian 

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:23.030
 and wanted to propose to build a team 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:27.040
 to represent the cnav your first to 

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:27.040
 from there you are ready
