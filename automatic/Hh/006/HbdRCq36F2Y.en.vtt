all different resources of course in
this<00:01:32.340> day<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.579> age<00:01:32.880> everybody<00:01:33.840> has<00:01:34.049> access<00:01:34.229> to

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 
and technology at home so we certainly

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.820 
and technology at home so we certainly
don't<00:01:44.210> want<00:01:44.330> them<00:01:44.510> to<00:01:44.720> power<00:01:44.900> down<00:01:45.170> when<00:01:45.710> they

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
don't want them to power down when they

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.380 
don't want them to power down when they
come<00:01:46.010> to<00:01:46.160> school<00:01:46.280> they're<00:01:46.790> used<00:01:47.060> to<00:01:47.180> using

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
come to school they're used to using

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.570 
come to school they're used to using
iPads<00:01:47.990> that<00:01:48.170> used<00:01:48.440> to<00:01:48.560> using<00:01:48.800> their<00:01:49.100> iPhones

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
iPads that used to using their iPhones

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.510 
iPads that used to using their iPhones
and<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:50.930> try<00:01:51.140> to<00:01:51.200> integrate<00:01:51.530> that<00:01:51.980> in<00:01:52.340> a

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
and so we try to integrate that in a

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.210 
and so we try to integrate that in a
constructive<00:01:52.970> way<00:01:53.120> it's<00:01:54.110> not<00:01:54.410> fluff<00:01:54.800> but

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
constructive way it's not fluff but

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.490 
constructive way it's not fluff but
they're<00:01:55.460> they're<00:01:55.880> actually<00:01:56.360> learning<00:01:56.780> using

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
they're they're actually learning using

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.100 
they're they're actually learning using
