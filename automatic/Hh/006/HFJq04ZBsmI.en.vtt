00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
look at some of the options and then

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.160 
look at some of the options and then
we'll<00:00:17.640> take<00:00:17.789> a<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.270> some<00:00:18.660> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.840> images

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.790 
we'll take a look at some of the images
it<00:00:19.289> produces<00:00:19.740> so<00:00:19.920> we'll<00:00:20.010> go<00:00:20.100> into<00:00:20.279> camera<00:00:21.800> wait

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
it produces so we'll go into camera wait

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.009 
it produces so we'll go into camera wait
for<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.070> open<00:00:23.160> there<00:00:23.580> we<00:00:23.670> go<00:00:23.789> and<00:00:24.150> let's

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
for it to open there we go and let's

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.390 
for it to open there we go and let's
zoom<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.350> a<00:00:25.380> second<00:00:25.800> here<00:00:27.920> there<00:00:28.920> we<00:00:29.039> go<00:00:29.160> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
zoom in a second here there we go so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.919 
zoom in a second here there we go so
let's<00:00:29.519> take<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:29.789> look<00:00:30.000> at<00:00:30.090> some<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.330> the<00:00:30.570> options

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
as well which are similar we can record

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590
