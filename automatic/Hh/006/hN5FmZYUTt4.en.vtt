out<00:02:17.340> of<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.580> bag<00:02:17.760> I<00:02:18.060> didn't<00:02:18.690> get<00:02:18.840> it<00:02:18.930> a<00:02:18.990> little

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
out of the bag I didn't get it a little

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.870 
out of the bag I didn't get it a little
bit<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.440> shedding<00:02:19.890> but<00:02:20.010> I'm<00:02:20.160> not<00:02:20.340> getting<00:02:20.520> any

Shannon<00:02:21.300> right<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:21.630> which<00:02:21.900> i<00:02:22.020> think<00:02:22.080> is

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
Shannon right now which i think is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.960 
Shannon right now which i think is
normal<00:02:22.740> before<00:02:22.890> you<00:02:23.160> go<00:02:23.340> watch<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.760> hair

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
normal before you go watch the hair

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.500 
normal before you go watch the hair
anyway<00:02:24.420> there<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.740> lot<00:02:26.160> of<00:02:26.190> flyaways<00:02:27.180> in

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
anyway there are a lot of flyaways in

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.500 
anyway there are a lot of flyaways in
this<00:02:27.720> hair<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:29.160> hair<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.580> really<00:02:29.910> thick

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
this hair the hair is really thick

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.360 
this hair the hair is really thick
towards<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.230> web<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.740> then<00:02:31.890> as<00:02:32.100> you<00:02:32.250> get

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
towards the web and then as you get

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.699 
towards the web and then as you get
towards<00:02:32.820> the<00:02:32.880> end<00:02:32.970> it<00:02:33.510> just<00:02:33.720> stems<00:02:33.959> out<00:02:34.260> just<00:02:34.590> a

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
towards the end it just stems out just a

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:36.230 
towards the end it just stems out just a
little<00:02:34.950> bit<00:02:35.100> but<00:02:35.250> there<00:02:35.459> aren't<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.850> lot<00:02:35.880> of

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
little bit but there aren't a lot of

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.420 
little bit but there aren't a lot of
flyways<00:02:36.780> and<00:02:37.110> I<00:02:37.350> do<00:02:37.410> feel<00:02:37.800> like<00:02:37.830> because<00:02:38.400> of

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
flyways and I do feel like because of

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
flyways and I do feel like because of
the<00:02:38.700> processing<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.570> color<00:02:40.200> treatment

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
the processing and the color treatment

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.320 
the processing and the color treatment
that<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:41.070> hair<00:02:41.250> will<00:02:41.490> break<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:42.060> little<00:02:42.209> bit

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
that the hair will break a little bit

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.900 
that the hair will break a little bit
and<00:02:42.780> maybe<00:02:43.320> cost<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.860> little<00:02:44.010> bit<00:02:44.130> more<00:02:44.250> flowers

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and maybe cost a little bit more flowers

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.800 
and maybe cost a little bit more flowers
I<00:02:45.150> do<00:02:45.239> not<00:02:46.050> like<00:02:46.380> flowers<00:02:47.010> like<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:48.030> hair<00:02:48.330> when

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 
I do not like flowers like the hair when

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.930 
I do not like flowers like the hair when
you<00:02:48.989> flat<00:02:49.500> iron<00:02:49.770> it<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.250> if<00:02:50.400> you<00:02:50.520> don't<00:02:50.730> put

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
you flat iron it and if you don't put

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.370 
you flat iron it and if you don't put
like<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.540> lot<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.709> hairspray<00:02:53.070> or<00:02:53.910> all<00:02:54.510> on<00:02:55.200> it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
like a lot of hairspray or all on it

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.160 
like a lot of hairspray or all on it
like<00:02:55.590> the<00:02:55.800> flowers<00:02:56.400> are<00:02:56.610> just<00:02:56.640> really

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
like the flowers are just really

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.610 
like the flowers are just really
difficult<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.320> tame<00:02:58.590> so<00:02:59.070> like<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.519> really<00:03:00.620> don't

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
difficult to tame so like I really don't

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.310 
difficult to tame so like I really don't
like<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:02.040> lot<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.250> flowers<00:03:02.850> but<00:03:03.360> I<00:03:03.600> mean<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:04.140> is

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
like a lot of flowers but I mean it is

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.030 
like a lot of flowers but I mean it is
what<00:03:04.560> it<00:03:04.590> is<00:03:04.890> I<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.700> say<00:03:06.390> that<00:03:06.840> the<00:03:07.110> color<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
what it is I will say that the color is

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.789 
what it is I will say that the color is
not<00:03:08.400> really<00:03:08.790> red<00:03:09.060> it's<00:03:09.480> more<00:03:09.840> like<00:03:10.110> a<00:03:10.350> burgundy

00:03:10.789 --> 00:03:10.799 
not really red it's more like a burgundy

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.640 
not really red it's more like a burgundy
fuchsia<00:03:11.420> I<00:03:12.420> think<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.049> this<00:03:13.170> color<00:03:13.470> is

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
fuchsia I think that this color is

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.979 
fuchsia I think that this color is
supposed<00:03:13.980> to<00:03:14.070> be<00:03:14.250> like<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.670> 33<00:03:15.360> or<00:03:15.600> something

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
supposed to be like a 33 or something

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.979 
supposed to be like a 33 or something
like<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.170> it<00:03:16.620> is<00:03:16.950> really<00:03:17.370> pretty<00:03:17.610> I<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.600> tell

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
like that it is really pretty I can tell

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.080 
like that it is really pretty I can tell
by<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.290> way<00:03:19.560> that<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:19.980> was<00:03:20.250> color<00:03:20.549> treated

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
by the way that this was color treated

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.470 
by the way that this was color treated
that<00:03:21.600> they<00:03:21.840> bleached<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.470> hair<00:03:22.680> first<00:03:23.070> and

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
that they bleached the hair first and

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.780 
that they bleached the hair first and
because<00:03:24.480> this<00:03:24.870> hair<00:03:25.140> is<00:03:25.320> 1b<00:03:26.040> there<00:03:26.340> are<00:03:26.459> brown

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
because this hair is 1b there are brown

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:29.330 
because this hair is 1b there are brown
strands<00:03:27.330> in<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.840> so<00:03:28.260> they<00:03:28.650> bleached<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.160> hair

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
strands in it so they bleached the hair

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.580 
strands in it so they bleached the hair
first<00:03:29.640> maybe<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.480> area<00:03:30.989> and<00:03:31.170> then<00:03:31.380> they

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
first maybe in this area and then they

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.330 
first maybe in this area and then they
put<00:03:31.920> the<00:03:32.600> burgundy<00:03:33.600> color<00:03:34.170> or<00:03:34.620> whatever<00:03:35.040> this

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
put the burgundy color or whatever this

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:38.300 
put the burgundy color or whatever this
color<00:03:35.670> is<00:03:35.880> on<00:03:36.180> the<00:03:36.390> entire<00:03:36.840> bundle<00:03:37.290> because<00:03:37.830> I

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
color is on the entire bundle because I

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.729 
color is on the entire bundle because I
see<00:03:38.640> like<00:03:38.880> strands<00:03:39.330> of<00:03:39.720> like<00:03:39.989> burgundy

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
see like strands of like burgundy

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:43.670 
see like strands of like burgundy
fuchsia<00:03:41.400> within<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.209> hair<00:03:42.480> up<00:03:42.720> here<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.380> think

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
fuchsia within the hair up here I think

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.289 
fuchsia within the hair up here I think
that<00:03:43.799> is<00:03:43.950> really<00:03:44.160> really<00:03:44.280> pretty<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.910> I<00:03:45.030> think

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
that is really really pretty and I think

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:47.270 
that is really really pretty and I think
when<00:03:45.840> I<00:03:45.870> installed<00:03:46.410> it<00:03:46.530> it<00:03:46.680> will<00:03:46.830> look<00:03:46.980> really

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
when I installed it it will look really

I leave it on for about 10 minutes and

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:20.560 
I leave it on for about 10 minutes and

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:23.360 
density on this closure is low I would

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.890 
density on this closure is low I would
say<00:05:23.630> I<00:05:24.409> feel<00:05:25.130> like<00:05:25.400> this<00:05:25.880> area<00:05:26.240> right<00:05:26.509> here<00:05:26.570> is

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:26.900 
say I feel like this area right here is

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.399 
say I feel like this area right here is
a<00:05:27.080> little<00:05:27.440> bit<00:05:27.590> more<00:05:28.449> flat<00:05:29.449> than<00:05:29.479> this<00:05:30.020> area

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:30.409 
a little bit more flat than this area

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:31.779 
a little bit more flat than this area
over<00:05:30.500> here<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.009> I<00:05:31.070> think<00:05:31.130> that<00:05:31.430> that's<00:05:31.520> going

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
over here and I think that that's going

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.959 
over here and I think that that's going
to<00:05:31.880> propose<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.570> be<00:05:32.720> an<00:05:33.229> issue<00:05:33.590> as<00:05:34.099> far<00:05:34.370> as<00:05:34.699> like

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:34.969 
to propose to be an issue as far as like

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:36.999 
to propose to be an issue as far as like
getting<00:05:35.330> this<00:05:35.570> side<00:05:35.900> of<00:05:36.229> the<00:05:36.349> closure<00:05:36.590> to<00:05:36.830> lay

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
getting this side of the closure to lay

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.890 
getting this side of the closure to lay
down<00:05:37.039> but<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.490> will<00:05:37.699> keep<00:05:37.849> you<00:05:38.000> guys<00:05:38.030> updated<00:05:38.479> in
