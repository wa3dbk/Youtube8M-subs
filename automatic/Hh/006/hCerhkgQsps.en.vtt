00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.230 
here I don't know but it was definitely
taken<00:01:52.860> off<00:01:52.979> so<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.220> beside<00:01:53.610> definitely<00:01:54.119> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
taken off so this beside definitely is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.590 
taken off so this beside definitely is
different<00:01:54.979> by<00:01:55.979> two<00:01:56.040> things<00:01:56.399> it's<00:01:57.210> different

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
different by two things it's different

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.510 
different by two things it's different
by<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.840> the<00:01:58.320> laser<00:01:58.469> graphics<00:01:58.979> inside<00:01:59.310> here

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
by the the laser graphics inside here

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.030 
by the the laser graphics inside here
the<00:01:59.670> sole<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.180> like<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.290> bike<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.710> ones<00:02:01.920> in

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the sole and like the bike the ones in

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.139 
the sole and like the bike the ones in
November<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.780> Mike<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.140> Mars<00:02:04.320> uh<00:02:04.880> those<00:02:05.880> lace

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
November the Mike and Mars uh those lace

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.359 
November the Mike and Mars uh those lace
tabs<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.200> bottom<00:02:07.500> here<00:02:07.740> were<00:02:07.860> taken<00:02:08.069> off

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
tabs on the bottom here were taken off

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.200 
tabs on the bottom here were taken off
so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
so

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:10.580 
so
so<00:02:09.630> this<00:02:09.720> who<00:02:09.840> has<00:02:09.990> actually<00:02:10.170> two<00:02:10.440> different

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so this who has actually two different

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.380 
so this who has actually two different
things<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.610> make<00:02:11.940> it<00:02:12.060> different<00:02:12.210> from

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
things that that make it different from

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.540 
things that that make it different from
the<00:02:12.540> other<00:02:12.690> previous<00:02:13.020> physics<00:02:13.530> just<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.400> make

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
the other previous physics just to make

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:17.000 
the other previous physics just to make
a<00:02:14.580> point<00:02:14.790> of<00:02:14.940> it<00:02:15.470> anyway<00:02:16.470> this<00:02:16.650> who's<00:02:16.830> got<00:02:16.980> a

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
a point of it anyway this who's got a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.040 
a point of it anyway this who's got a
lot<00:02:17.160> of<00:02:17.190> colors<00:02:17.520> on<00:02:17.730> it

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
lot of colors on it

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.410 
lot of colors on it
you<00:02:19.440> got<00:02:19.560> your<00:02:19.710> elephant<00:02:20.010> print<00:02:20.250> here<00:02:20.430> I<00:02:20.850> don't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
you got your elephant print here I don't

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.630 
you got your elephant print here I don't
know<00:02:21.540> this<00:02:21.810> this<00:02:22.110> dark<00:02:22.740> grey<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.220> might<00:02:23.430> be<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
know this this dark grey it might be a

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.550 
know this this dark grey it might be a
3m<00:02:24.150> I<00:02:24.360> kind<00:02:24.720> of<00:02:24.750> think<00:02:24.930> it<00:02:25.110> is<00:02:25.230> it's<00:02:25.410> got<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
3m I kind of think it is it's got a

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.930 
3m I kind of think it is it's got a
little<00:02:25.620> bit<00:02:25.860> of<00:02:25.950> a<00:02:25.980> sheen<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.550> it<00:02:26.580> but<00:02:26.790> that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
little bit of a sheen to it but that

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.940 
little bit of a sheen to it but that
probably<00:02:27.210> is<00:02:27.360> a<00:02:27.420> 3m<00:02:27.780> this<00:02:28.350> is<00:02:28.470> like<00:02:28.590> a<00:02:28.620> slate

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
probably is a 3m this is like a slate

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
probably is a 3m this is like a slate
grey<00:02:29.250> it's<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.120> nice<00:02:30.300> light<00:02:30.570> grey<00:02:30.810> tumbled

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
grey it's a nice light grey tumbled

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.790 
grey it's a nice light grey tumbled
leather<00:02:31.320> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.420> the<00:02:33.420> quality<00:02:33.810> is<00:02:33.990> very<00:02:34.050> nice

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
leather this is the quality is very nice

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.240 
leather this is the quality is very nice
you've<00:02:35.430> got<00:02:35.610> your<00:02:35.760> maze<00:02:36.000> which<00:02:36.270> is<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.540> yellow

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
you've got your maze which is the yellow

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.760 
you've got your maze which is the yellow
right<00:02:38.250> there<00:02:38.310> comes<00:02:39.320> it's<00:02:40.320> also<00:02:40.470> got<00:02:40.740> some

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
right there comes it's also got some

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.370 
right there comes it's also got some
long<00:02:41.160> yellow<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.730> mace<00:02:41.910> leg<00:02:42.240> places<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.170> it's

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
long yellow the mace leg places and it's

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.400 
long yellow the mace leg places and it's
also<00:02:43.560> here<00:02:43.920> on<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> jump<00:02:44.430> man<00:02:44.610> here<00:02:45.290> on<00:02:46.290> the

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
also here on the jump man here on the

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.790 
also here on the jump man here on the
tunnel<00:02:46.800> that<00:02:47.160> maze<00:02:47.340> comes<00:02:47.640> back<00:02:47.820> in<00:02:48.800> you've

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
tunnel that maze comes back in you've

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:51.140 
tunnel that maze comes back in you've
got<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.070> blue<00:02:50.250> here<00:02:50.490> on<00:02:50.580> top<00:02:50.760> of<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:50.970> wing

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
got the blue here on top of the wing

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.750 
got the blue here on top of the wing
also<00:02:51.930> gonna<00:02:52.110> midsole<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.160> also<00:02:53.460> on<00:02:53.670> the

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
also gonna midsole and also on the

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.220 
also gonna midsole and also on the
inside<00:02:54.120> again<00:02:54.570> that's<00:02:54.840> where<00:02:54.960> that<00:02:55.020> laser

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
inside again that's where that laser

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.130 
inside again that's where that laser
graphic<00:02:55.650> should<00:02:55.770> have<00:02:55.890> been<00:02:56.010> but<00:02:56.100> it's<00:02:56.250> not

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
graphic should have been but it's not

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.550 
graphic should have been but it's not
and<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.290> this<00:02:58.440> look<00:02:58.680> at<00:02:58.800> the<00:02:58.860> bottom<00:03:00.560> there's

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
and in this look at the bottom there's

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.150 
and in this look at the bottom there's
no<00:03:01.710> car<00:03:01.980> here<00:03:02.220> there's<00:03:03.180> nothing<00:03:03.450> on<00:03:03.540> the<00:03:03.600> paper

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
no car here there's nothing on the paper

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.020 
no car here there's nothing on the paper
that's<00:03:05.160> how<00:03:05.310> they've<00:03:05.460> been<00:03:05.580> changed<00:03:05.910> in<00:03:05.970> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
that's how they've been changed in the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.460 
that's how they've been changed in the
last<00:03:06.120> physic<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:06.630> think<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:06.990> same<00:03:07.230> thing

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
last physic I think was the same thing

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.840 
last physic I think was the same thing
they<00:03:07.680> took<00:03:07.830> out<00:03:08.010> those<00:03:08.190> those<00:03:08.700> cards<00:03:09.560> put<00:03:10.560> out

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
they took out those those cards put out

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.100 
they took out those those cards put out
it<00:03:11.850> looks<00:03:12.030> like<00:03:12.180> the<00:03:12.300> bottom<00:03:12.510> of<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.840> shoe

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
it looks like the bottom of the shoe

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.750 
it looks like the bottom of the shoe
except<00:03:13.710> now<00:03:13.800> the<00:03:13.860> green<00:03:14.130> is<00:03:14.250> even<00:03:14.460> on<00:03:14.580> there<00:03:14.730> I

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
except now the green is even on there I

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.700 
except now the green is even on there I
think<00:03:14.820> all<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.480> colors<00:03:15.900> well<00:03:16.440> except<00:03:16.680> for

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
think all the colors well except for

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:20.810 
think all the colors well except for
black<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.490> on<00:03:17.760> the<00:03:17.940> bottom<00:03:19.070> yeah<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.340> gold<00:03:20.610> the

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
black is on the bottom yeah the gold the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.330 
black is on the bottom yeah the gold the
red<00:03:21.030> the<00:03:21.450> blue<00:03:21.740> slate<00:03:22.740> great<00:03:23.040> now<00:03:23.280> the

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
red the blue slate great now the

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.310 
red the blue slate great now the
charcoal<00:03:23.850> is<00:03:23.910> not<00:03:24.060> on<00:03:24.180> here<00:03:24.390> the<00:03:24.900> green<00:03:25.170> is

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
charcoal is not on here the green is

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.730 
charcoal is not on here the green is
here<00:03:25.500> also<00:03:26.070> here<00:03:26.250> in<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> air<00:03:26.550> bubble<00:03:26.910> here

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
here also here in the air bubble here

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:29.660 
here also here in the air bubble here
almost<00:03:28.740> the<00:03:29.010> colors<00:03:29.250> here<00:03:29.370> on<00:03:29.430> the<00:03:29.520> bottom

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
almost the colors here on the bottom

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.110 
almost the colors here on the bottom
both<00:03:30.000> bottoms<00:03:30.360> are<00:03:30.480> identical<00:03:31.790> and<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.880> time

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
both bottoms are identical and this time

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.820 
both bottoms are identical and this time
now<00:03:33.240> we've<00:03:33.420> got<00:03:33.570> no<00:03:33.780> ice<00:03:34.050> anywhere<00:03:34.560> on<00:03:34.650> this

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
now we've got no ice anywhere on this

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.070 
now we've got no ice anywhere on this
this<00:03:34.980> is<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.310> full<00:03:36.890> regular<00:03:37.890> CDDA<00:03:38.280> bottom<00:03:39.080> or

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
this is the full regular CDDA bottom or
