of<00:01:58.250> the<00:01:58.340> box<00:01:58.550> they<00:01:58.880> can<00:01:59.060> rotate<00:01:59.450> and<00:01:59.690> go

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
of the box they can rotate and go

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.330 
of the box they can rotate and go
wherever<00:01:59.990> the<00:02:00.620> only<00:02:00.830> weird<00:02:01.010> thing<00:02:01.040> is<00:02:01.250> you

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
wherever the only weird thing is you

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.140 
wherever the only weird thing is you
can't<00:02:01.580> pull<00:02:02.360> them<00:02:02.540> closer<00:02:03.470> to<00:02:03.740> her<00:02:03.860> sides<00:02:04.850> than

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
can't pull them closer to her sides than

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.820 
can't pull them closer to her sides than
this<00:02:05.300> so<00:02:05.540> she's<00:02:05.750> always<00:02:06.050> got<00:02:06.230> her<00:02:06.350> arms<00:02:06.620> sort

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:06.830

00:03:13.479 --> 00:03:13.489 
it's weird that they have painted the

00:03:13.489 --> 00:03:15.790 
it's weird that they have painted the
center<00:03:14.030> because<00:03:14.750> it<00:03:15.140> kind<00:03:15.410> of<00:03:15.470> just<00:03:15.620> looks

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
center because it kind of just looks

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.949 
center because it kind of just looks
like<00:03:15.920> she<00:03:16.069> grew<00:03:16.280> an<00:03:16.430> extra<00:03:16.550> section<00:03:17.510> to<00:03:17.720> her

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
front of it comes up words and well the

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.930 
front of it comes up words and well the
assets<00:03:51.739> of<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:52.010> is<00:03:52.130> nice<00:03:52.310> it<00:03:52.519> means<00:03:52.730> that

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
assets of that is nice it means that

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.060 
assets of that is nice it means that
she's<00:03:53.090> not<00:03:53.239> very<00:03:53.359> stable<00:03:53.810> because<00:03:54.230> I<00:03:54.739> don't

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
she's not very stable because I don't

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.140 
she's not very stable because I don't
know<00:03:55.130> if<00:03:55.190> you<00:03:55.250> can<00:03:55.340> tell<00:03:55.430> but<00:03:55.489> those<00:03:55.820> are<00:03:55.970> small

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
feet and she's very top-heavy and so

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.170 
feet and she's very top-heavy and so
it's<00:03:59.450> kind<00:03:59.750> of<00:03:59.840> hard<00:03:59.900> for<00:04:00.290> her<00:04:00.440> to<00:04:00.620> stand<00:04:01.010> so<00:04:02.000> it

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
it's kind of hard for her to stand so it

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.860 
it's kind of hard for her to stand so it
kind<00:04:02.420> of<00:04:02.450> just<00:04:02.600> likes<00:04:02.750> to<00:04:02.810> fall<00:04:03.049> over<00:04:03.130> also<00:04:04.870> I

kind of just likes to fall over also I
don't<00:04:06.530> know<00:04:06.590> if<00:04:06.680> this<00:04:06.769> is<00:04:06.829> a<00:04:07.010> Gus<00:04:07.220> like<00:04:07.549> you<00:04:07.760> see

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
don't know if this is a Gus like you see

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.199 
don't know if this is a Gus like you see
issue<00:04:08.269> or<00:04:08.359> not<00:04:08.540> but<00:04:08.870> my<00:04:09.590> feet<00:04:09.950> on<00:04:10.190> on<00:04:10.549> my<00:04:10.820> sample

issue or not but my feet on on my sample

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:13.420 
issue or not but my feet on on my sample
aren't<00:04:11.510> exactly<00:04:11.900> symmetrical<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:12.859> if<00:04:13.070> I<00:04:13.190> want

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430

look<00:06:24.310> at<00:06:24.490> there's<00:06:24.820> enough<00:06:25.000> articulation<00:06:25.630> to

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
look at there's enough articulation to

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.600 
look at there's enough articulation to
satisfy<00:06:26.110> most<00:06:26.320> pose<00:06:26.620> ability<00:06:27.040> junkies<00:06:27.430> and

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.080 
even though one of her accessories

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.810 
even though one of her accessories
didn't<00:06:29.470> turn<00:06:29.590> out<00:06:29.680> so<00:06:29.740> great<00:06:30.010> I'm<00:06:30.280> quite<00:06:30.669> glad

00:06:30.810 --> 00:06:30.820 
didn't turn out so great I'm quite glad

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.370
