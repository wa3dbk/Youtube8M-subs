you're gonna need it you won't be able

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.949 
you're gonna need it you won't be able
to<00:02:10.289> do<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.370> very<00:02:11.489> easily<00:02:11.580> later

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
to do it very easily later

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.619 
to do it very easily later
all<00:02:13.290> right<00:02:13.650> now<00:02:14.250> take<00:02:14.849> your<00:02:15.000> shooter<00:02:15.329> paper

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
all right now take your shooter paper

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.059 
all right now take your shooter paper
this<00:02:15.750> is<00:02:15.900> not<00:02:16.049> a<00:02:16.079> standard<00:02:16.530> sheet<00:02:16.859> of<00:02:16.980> paper

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
this is not a standard sheet of paper

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.640 
this is not a standard sheet of paper
but<00:02:17.370> it's<00:02:17.489> close<00:02:17.700> enough<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.840> cut<00:02:19.049> it<00:02:19.079> in

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
but it's close enough and you cut it in

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:26.420 
but it's close enough and you cut it in
half<00:02:22.790> all<00:02:23.790> right<00:02:23.939> then<00:02:24.659> you<00:02:25.439> tape<00:02:25.680> let<00:02:26.250> sheet

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
half all right then you tape let sheet

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.229 
half all right then you tape let sheet
of<00:02:26.519> paper<00:02:26.640> and<00:02:26.969> you<00:02:27.030> wrap<00:02:27.420> it<00:02:27.629> around<00:02:28.909> the<00:02:29.909> end

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
of paper and you wrap it around the end

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.360 
of paper and you wrap it around the end
of<00:02:30.599> this<00:02:30.810> tube<00:02:31.939> best<00:02:32.939> you<00:02:33.120> can

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
of this tube best you can

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.309 
of this tube best you can
needs<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.549> be<00:02:35.670> tight<00:02:35.909> so<00:02:36.299> sometimes<00:02:37.109> you'll

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
needs to be tight so sometimes you'll

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.129 
needs to be tight so sometimes you'll
have<00:02:37.409> to<00:02:37.620> do<00:02:38.189> it<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.400> couple<00:02:38.549> times<00:02:38.909> you<00:02:39.870> get<00:02:40.049> it

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:40.139 
have to do it a couple times you get it

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:42.559 
have to do it a couple times you get it
just<00:02:40.469> tight<00:02:40.889> enough<00:02:40.920> on<00:02:41.400> exit<00:02:41.879> needs<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.420> be

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
just tight enough on exit needs to be

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.220 
just tight enough on exit needs to be
tight<00:02:43.939> okay<00:02:44.939> then<00:02:45.180> you<00:02:45.329> take<00:02:45.599> your<00:02:45.629> piece<00:02:46.200> of

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
tight okay then you take your piece of

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.740 
tight okay then you take your piece of
tape<00:02:46.379> here<00:02:47.299> and<00:02:48.299> you<00:02:48.569> tape<00:02:48.810> it<00:02:50.480> then<00:02:51.480> you<00:02:51.599> take

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
tape here and you tape it then you take

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.819 
tape here and you tape it then you take
your<00:02:51.780> second<00:02:52.169> sheet<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.379> paper<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.650> do<00:02:52.739> the

your second sheet of paper and do the

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.250 
your second sheet of paper and do the
same<00:02:53.040> thing<00:02:53.310> on<00:02:53.459> top<00:02:53.700> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.419> first<00:02:54.780> make<00:02:55.230> sure

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
same thing on top of the first make sure

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:02.959 
same thing on top of the first make sure
you<00:02:55.530> get<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:55.739> as<00:02:55.889> tight<00:02:56.220> as<00:02:57.260> possible<00:03:01.879> try<00:03:02.879> and

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:02.969 
you get it as tight as possible try and

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.129 
you get it as tight as possible try and
keep<00:03:03.090> it<00:03:03.269> as<00:03:03.389> flush<00:03:04.349> as<00:03:04.379> you<00:03:04.739> can<00:03:04.950> also<00:03:06.139> I'm

going around the edges the tape of the

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:14.990 
going around the edges the tape of the
paper<00:03:09.180> that<00:03:09.389> is<00:03:09.739> then<00:03:11.030> take<00:03:12.030> your<00:03:12.209> tape<00:03:14.000> and

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
paper that is then take your tape and

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.030 
paper that is then take your tape and
put<00:03:15.269> it<00:03:15.299> on<00:03:15.569> there<00:03:17.930> all<00:03:18.930> right<00:03:19.079> now<00:03:19.829> what<00:03:19.949> you

little bit you can see there I've left

00:03:26.639 --> 00:03:28.159 
little bit you can see there I've left
the<00:03:26.970> outer<00:03:27.180> sheet<00:03:27.540> of<00:03:27.629> paper<00:03:27.750> slightly

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
the outer sheet of paper slightly

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:31.550 
the outer sheet of paper slightly
overlapped<00:03:28.859> or<00:03:29.159> over<00:03:30.120> the<00:03:30.359> edge<00:03:30.479> of<00:03:30.689> this<00:03:30.810> PVC

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.580 
overlapped or over the edge of this PVC
and<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.790> want<00:03:32.939> to<00:03:33.030> fold<00:03:33.299> this<00:03:33.479> in<00:03:36.139> by<00:03:37.139> folding

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
and you want to fold this in by folding

over<00:03:45.120> it<00:03:45.150> and<00:03:45.299> I'm<00:03:45.389> going<00:03:45.509> to<00:03:45.659> do<00:03:45.750> two<00:03:45.989> here

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
over it and I'm going to do two here

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.860 
over it and I'm going to do two here
sometimes<00:03:47.819> we<00:03:47.939> want<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.090> work<00:03:48.299> sometimes<00:03:48.780> you

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
sometimes we want to work sometimes you

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.129 
sometimes we want to work sometimes you
need<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.579> but<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.790> gives<00:03:51.120> it<00:03:51.269> added<00:03:51.720> strength

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
need to but that gives it added strength

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:57.379 
need to but that gives it added strength
to<00:03:53.359> to<00:03:54.359> the<00:03:54.479> end<00:03:54.659> of<00:03:54.810> your<00:03:55.040> rocket<00:03:56.040> here<00:03:56.389> now

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
to to the end of your rocket here now

00:03:57.389 --> 00:04:02.270 
to to the end of your rocket here now
you<00:03:58.049> can<00:03:58.199> pull<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.650> first<00:03:59.370> one<00:03:59.729> out<00:04:00.540> and<00:04:01.280> put

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
you can pull the first one out and put

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.550 
you can pull the first one out and put
it<00:04:02.370> to<00:04:02.459> the<00:04:02.489> side<00:04:02.840> now<00:04:03.840> if<00:04:03.959> you<00:04:04.019> realize<00:04:04.259> if<00:04:04.439> you

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
it to the side now if you realize if you

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.699 
it to the side now if you realize if you
gently<00:04:04.889> put<00:04:05.129> this<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.669> edge<00:04:05.959> that<00:04:06.959> it

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
gently put this over the edge that it

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.819 
gently put this over the edge that it
goes<00:04:07.859> on<00:04:08.509> up<00:04:09.509> and<00:04:09.720> up<00:04:10.019> and<00:04:10.139> down<00:04:10.229> pretty<00:04:10.590> easily

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
goes on up and up and down pretty easily

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.939 
goes on up and up and down pretty easily
but<00:04:11.189> it's<00:04:11.340> still<00:04:11.519> quite<00:04:12.299> flush<00:04:12.840> quite<00:04:13.739> tight

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:13.949 
but it's still quite flush quite tight

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:16.939 
but it's still quite flush quite tight
to<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.370> tube<00:04:14.599> that<00:04:15.599> allows<00:04:15.870> for<00:04:16.109> the<00:04:16.259> the<00:04:16.769> air

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
to the tube that allows for the the air

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.649 
to the tube that allows for the the air
to<00:04:17.280> create<00:04:17.430> maximum<00:04:17.759> pressure<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.389> push<00:04:18.509> it

00:04:18.649 --> 00:04:18.659 
to create maximum pressure and push it

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:21.920 
to create maximum pressure and push it
out<00:04:18.810> now<00:04:19.500> it's<00:04:19.530> time<00:04:20.329> go<00:04:21.329> get<00:04:21.479> you<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.659> piece<00:04:21.750> of
