coffee every single morning so I've

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.010 
coffee every single morning so I've
always<00:01:23.700> wanted<00:01:23.880> to<00:01:24.030> earn<00:01:24.180> residual<00:01:24.689> income

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

and<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.229> just<00:01:25.409> thought<00:01:25.560> what<00:01:25.799> better<00:01:25.920> way<00:01:26.189> to

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
and I just thought what better way to

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.760 
and I just thought what better way to
earn<00:01:27.060> residual<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.990> a<00:01:28.020> product<00:01:28.350> that's<00:01:28.590> been

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
earn residual to a product that's been

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
earn residual to a product that's been
around<00:01:28.890> for<00:01:29.310> hundreds<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.790> years<00:01:30.140> and<00:01:31.140> then

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
around for hundreds of years and then

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.480 
around for hundreds of years and then
combine<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> with<00:01:31.740> network<00:01:32.070> mark<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.460> I

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
combine it with network mark and I

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.069 
combine it with network mark and I
