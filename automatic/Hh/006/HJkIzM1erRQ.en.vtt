00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.899
 very good to all welcome to this 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.410
 new video so expected by all 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.809
 yeah well I'm referring to 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:12.719
 revive a blackberry in quotes 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 anyone to blackberry including 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.100
 tactile and non-tactile good as 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.580
 revive a blackberry in quotation marks and 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.300
 in quotation marks because 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:25.570
 because the blackberry understands at least 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.820
 a red light 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.780
 the logo the only thing that does not answer 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 when we are going to understand it there is everything 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.430
 and I have the solution 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.260
 many people of you have told me 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.940
 asked to make this video well 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.770
 here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.150
 what are we going to do because the blackberry 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.310
 do this 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.910
 this does it 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.460
 when it takes a while without recharging and 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:55.220
 the battery dies for him so 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:57.110
 say it dies it runs out of energy 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.900
 and then when we go to 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.720
 teach the mobile does not answer in normal 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.190
 because the battery is dead 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.280
 good 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.360
 the solution is not to charge the mobile 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.610
 with the charger or with this charger 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.310
 he will not do either he will not do anything 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.950
 we will get the red light too but 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.810
 It is not going to do anything we move from 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.399
 and the solution is this this charger 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:28.450
 batteries that we can find in 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.470
 Any Chinese vale charges batteries all 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.050
 type of batteries 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.160
 what we are going to do is take the battery 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.160
 of our mobile 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:43.010
 put the know if you see I do not know if I'm the 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:45.950
 so it will be 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:48.280
 Well, that's how it was before but 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.280
 I see what 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:56.370
 if this is the battery the irons have 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:58.760
 to go one to the left another to the 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.760
 right 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.700
 3 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:11.600
 they have to be in contact 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.400
 and then do not stain the current 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.490
 the minimum number of hours that you should leave the 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.460
 battery of recharges or at least 20 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.250
 hours I recommend that you leave everything 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:26.510
 day to have it 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.510
 it would be fine canada there is such 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.050
 you see there the reds come but masters that 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.630
 they pay 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:36.020
 then understand 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:38.990
 Y 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:41.240
 well, the battery the mobile is that 

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:46.569
 I have a year ago or something that is 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:49.180

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:52.480
