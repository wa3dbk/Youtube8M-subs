received in one of my subscription
services<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.059> think<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.299> might<00:00:51.420> have<00:00:51.449> been

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.869 
services I think I might have been
glossybox<00:00:52.229> when<00:00:52.470> I<00:00:52.500> had<00:00:52.739> it<00:00:52.890> so<00:00:53.549> it<00:00:53.670> says<00:00:53.850> to

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
glossybox when I had it so it says to

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.240 
glossybox when I had it so it says to
just<00:00:54.239> put<00:00:54.479> a<00:00:54.659> thin<00:00:54.960> layer<00:00:55.170> on<00:00:55.739> your<00:00:55.799> lips<00:00:56.129> and

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
just put a thin layer on your lips and

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.799 
just put a thin layer on your lips and
it<00:00:56.339> actually<00:00:56.699> says<00:00:56.879> that<00:00:56.909> you<00:00:57.089> should<00:00:57.449> use<00:00:57.659> it

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it actually says that you should use it

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:58.700 
it actually says that you should use it
day<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.199> night

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
day and night

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.670 
day and night

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
so this is a serum or generous amount

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.679 
so this is a serum or generous amount
actually<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:05.460> says<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.880> hold<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:11.540> just<00:01:12.540> make

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
different I think there might be

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.910 
different I think there might be
slightly<00:02:43.799> plumper<00:02:44.459> than<00:02:44.609> what<00:02:44.790> they<00:02:44.910> were

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
slightly plumper than what they were

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.410 
slightly plumper than what they were
especially<00:02:46.920> my<00:02:47.280> top<00:02:47.519> lip<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.970> looks<00:02:48.120> like<00:02:48.269> it's

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
Oh Darren's

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:09.560 
Oh Darren's
but<00:04:07.060> I<00:04:07.090> don't<00:04:07.330> think<00:04:07.480> it's<00:04:07.660> a<00:04:07.750> big<00:04:07.900> enough

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
but I don't think it's a big enough

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.420 
but I don't think it's a big enough
difference<00:04:10.570> for<00:04:11.050> me<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.290> go<00:04:11.380> out<00:04:11.470> and<00:04:11.680> spend<00:04:11.980> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
difference for me to go out and spend I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.430 
difference for me to go out and spend I
believe<00:04:13.060> it's<00:04:13.210> 28<00:04:13.690> in<00:04:13.780> the<00:04:13.810> States<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.290> it's

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
believe it's 28 in the States so it's

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.040 
believe it's 28 in the States so it's
probably<00:04:14.710> like<00:04:14.770> 33<00:04:15.610> 32<00:04:16.030> and<00:04:16.360> Canada<00:04:16.870> so<00:04:17.020> I

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.050 
probably like 33 32 and Canada so I

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.240 
probably like 33 32 and Canada so I
don't<00:04:17.260> think<00:04:17.440> it's<00:04:17.590> have<00:04:17.709> enough<00:04:17.950> of<00:04:18.100> a

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
don't think it's have enough of a

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.850 
don't think it's have enough of a
difference<00:04:18.840> for<00:04:19.840> me<00:04:19.930> to<00:04:20.080> go<00:04:20.200> spend<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.620> much

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:20.860 
difference for me to go spend that much

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.590 
difference for me to go spend that much
