weapon so this breach camo pack here is

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.860 
weapon so this breach camo pack here is
a<00:00:30.990> fairly<00:00:31.470> plain<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:32.160> camo<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.360> the<00:00:33.540> way<00:00:33.630> that

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
a fairly plain and camo in the way that

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.510 
a fairly plain and camo in the way that
it<00:00:33.960> actually<00:00:33.989> looks<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.010> can<00:00:35.190> see<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
it actually looks you can see the

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.690 
it actually looks you can see the
calling<00:00:35.940> card<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.390> screen<00:00:37.110> here<00:00:37.410> as<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:38.010> but

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
calling card on screen here as well but

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.310 
calling card on screen here as well but
I<00:00:38.820> feel<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.360> actual<00:00:39.690> sites<00:00:40.110> are

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
I feel that the actual sites are

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
I feel that the actual sites are
actually<00:00:40.710> fairly<00:00:40.950> useful<00:00:41.460> if<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.820> take<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:42.000> look

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
actually fairly useful if we take a look

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.840 
actually fairly useful if we take a look
at<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.390> first<00:00:42.660> side<00:00:42.930> here<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.950> reflex<00:00:44.550> sights

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
at the first side here the reflex sights

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
at the first side here the reflex sights
in<00:00:45.510> action<00:00:45.899> we<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.020> actually<00:00:46.230> see<00:00:46.530> that<00:00:46.649> it's

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
in action we can actually see that it's

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.680 
in action we can actually see that it's
actually<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> fairly<00:00:47.340> useful<00:00:47.760> sight<00:00:48.180> it's

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
actually a fairly useful sight it's

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.750 
actually a fairly useful sight it's
fairly<00:00:49.020> accurate<00:00:49.140> in<00:00:49.739> terms<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.280> cross

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
fairly accurate in terms of the cross

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.459 
fairly accurate in terms of the cross
on-screen<00:00:51.480> as<00:00:51.600> if<00:00:51.690> we<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:51.960> a<00:00:51.989> look<00:00:52.140> in<00:00:52.289> here

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
on-screen as if we have a look in here

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.049 
on-screen as if we have a look in here
and<00:00:52.680> what<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> tend<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.489> find<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.850> lot<00:00:54.030> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and what you tend to find with a lot of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.029 
and what you tend to find with a lot of
these<00:00:54.270> DLC<00:00:54.840> packs<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.320> that<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:55.620> reticule

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
these DLC packs is that the reticule

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.010 
these DLC packs is that the reticule
aren't<00:00:56.460> always<00:00:56.610> that<00:00:56.789> great<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.510> so<00:00:57.930> if

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
aren't always that great and so if

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.569 
aren't always that great and so if
you're<00:00:58.109> interested<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> sort<00:00:58.980> of<00:00:59.039> reticles
