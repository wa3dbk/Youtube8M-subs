if<00:01:12.740> he<00:01:12.980> can<00:01:13.130> work<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.550> so<00:01:13.760> then<00:01:13.910> the<00:01:14.060> idea<00:01:14.390> was

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
if he can work and so then the idea was

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:17.170 
if he can work and so then the idea was
born<00:01:15.020> after<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.770> well<00:01:16.130> again<00:01:16.730> I<00:01:16.790> think<00:01:16.910> it's

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
born after that well again I think it's

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.610 
born after that well again I think it's
important<00:01:17.570> to<00:01:17.600> emphasize<00:01:17.750> that<00:01:18.020> these<00:01:18.290> videos

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
important to emphasize that these videos

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.160 
important to emphasize that these videos
are<00:01:18.800> not<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:19.430> for<00:01:19.670> children<00:01:20.150> with<00:01:20.720> issues

are not just for children with issues
such<00:01:21.380> as<00:01:21.410> autism<00:01:22.280> they<00:01:22.520> can<00:01:22.790> appeal<00:01:23.120> to<00:01:23.270> a<00:01:23.300> lot

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
such as autism they can appeal to a lot

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.640 
such as autism they can appeal to a lot
of<00:01:23.540> different<00:01:23.780> children<00:01:24.050> but<00:01:24.200> what<00:01:24.380> is<00:01:24.500> it

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650

well<00:01:28.760> I<00:01:29.120> think<00:01:29.660> that<00:01:30.170> there's<00:01:30.350> really<00:01:30.410> nothing

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:31.010
