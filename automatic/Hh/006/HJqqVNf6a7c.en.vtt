00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.230
 hi to all these fise themes today 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.210
 we find ourselves for a small video 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.720
 which clara background I will introduce to my 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.710
 sq ride 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.880
 I hope you enjoyed it and 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.629
 today I present to you is some 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.739
 thing that will serve me to beat like that 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:37.879
 not going bad to present you a 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.350
 maximum of gameplay so el gato the 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.730
 case the cake so everyone 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.050
 know so i think an eagle on hd 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.750
 which of course allows for movies and 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.430
 equip themselves in hd why I chose 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.850
 I'm there I think it was more 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.500
 interesting 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.300
 we would like to go out with him I 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.280
 open be hama there is little thicker 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.949
 than expected 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.699
 So it's the big one like that 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:58.340
 maybe will happen better than I 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.390
 can inches and one side so that's it 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.140
 so why I chose that one 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:02.359
 rather than another 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.199
 already it aligns itself with 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.720
 price good and maybe they have 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:09.590
 hamsik or more expensive than some but at 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.880
 low level of connections this is the 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.250
 the better is the one who leaves the least 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.780
 very bad son everywhere actually 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:16.429
 and then the level of size and everything 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.009
 it's low capacity I think 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:20.720
 it was via choose me so I on ps3 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:23.569
 so I showed you first the 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.300
 unpacking is the cake with all 

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:29.509
 the cables and all that and after I you 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.739
 make a video in the same of course of 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.789
 connections and after the software finally 

00:01:33.739 --> 00:01:36.080
 at least from what I understood because 

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:38.929
 that in any case I received them this morning 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.830
 and that's so great I made 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:42.410
 little ones and so it works 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.130
 pretty good even so here we go 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:46.220
 start immediately 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.800
 so we forget the case gast so 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.259
 already super packaging frankly so the 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.879
 case is there so I showed you 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.020
 directly because it's a bit more 

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:57.689
 important i think 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.549
 so here is the case the cake so 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:05.909
 super small yes a little bit 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.200
 connections do not see much so 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.019
 to compare to the limit that we can 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.430
 to make that fight is a phone a 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:14.370
 year you see a little difference 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.900
 there is not much it's a little 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.530
 case so super nice than super 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.069
 good abilities 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.660
 so that's the case 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:27.870
 then at the cables the other the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:32.190
 caps below was already unpacked for you 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:34.349
 shows then we have a cable hdmi offered 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.299
 so it's convenient but we limit 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:37.769
 will not serve for ps3 players but 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:39.299
 rather for the xbox players but 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.970
 stock market page anyway you do you 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.380
 will you say no HDMI cable provided 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:52.099
 then a cable to connect the is the 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.120
 pc cake also provides usb cable 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:55.560
 that's the cables I do 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.989
 like that we need nothing else 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.180
 that what provide us has so and 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.130
 after the cable had in in motion which 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.480
 called here was just like life 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.530
 simply 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:11.910
 so this in the is the cake see well 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.239
 the tacc and that on the ps3 ok we are 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.030
 Okay 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.709
 so that's it and after that he 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.450
 remained on two draws there is always a 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.829
 hope 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.310
 see power me I do not use it 

00:03:19.829 --> 00:03:21.840
 personally 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.370
 and that's why I have 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.819
 chose this group because simply 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:27.900
 mater does not allow me to put yuv 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:29.819
 is that the age of the enemies on it and 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.250
 all that so I could just 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.160
 not me hd hd pvr in all a bigger 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.060
 so that's the next thing 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.380
 regards the hookups I 'm going to do 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.000
 a rather simple thing because I have not 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.169
 in fact I 'm doing you I'm with my pc 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.430
 I have a lot of trouble developing these two 

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.349
 everywhere in the room to show 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.880
 stuff so to make it simple already 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.459
 you need a computer 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.660
 so that I think you pointed it out 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.849
 these two videos in any case you have to 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.959
 have it you need a console so 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.489
 I'm going to make the connections in 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.010
 ps3 but i could also explain 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.980
 those of the xbox is the same except one 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.349
 little detail amy's bondage 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:04.280
 finally short one and so you need a 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:06.500
 console so ps3 or xbox a pc and a 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.510
 telly so if you have the three you 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.180
 can buy this case I do not 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.569
 the game play I then explain first 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.660
 I tell you to connect to ps3 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:19.130
 you plug in the verrine 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.560
 this one has believed in life there 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.180
 must plug this cable not returning 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.240
 in 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:28.310
 takjout mounts directly up 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.340
 inserted for xbox players you 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.370
 will not use this cable if you 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.100
 will use the hdmi so you meet 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.289
 in the cable hdmi in you go back there 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.729
 in the street if you put anything that and 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.580
 you join directly on your 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:43.820
 xbox in hdmi we saw that we can not the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.010
 to put 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:50.810
 seen that the the playstation 3 a trick of 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:53.240
 privacy for amy blah's life 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.280
 not really what's left between them ben 

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:56.990
 we plugged water with 2 so had 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.990
 once you have plug the AV cable 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:03.410
 in the end of the cable 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.300
 it is this one tac that you recognize 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.800
 surely so you're going plugged 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.120
 in the ps3 to bring it here like that me 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.770
 I can show you directly if not 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:16.520
 it would have been a little bit so putting the 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:19.099
 ps3 toc senecal is here here one to 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.270
 food is here that's where we go 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:20.900
 plug in the stuff that's for the 

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.000
 optics 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.410
 so if you have an astro whatever it is 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.539
 either I do not know how to get by 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.729
 hdmi but that's a cable and earth 

00:05:26.539 --> 00:05:29.990
 for the room collection so hop this 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.110
 do what I told you 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:42.080
 branch I find this cable here opts 

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:44.300
 here in one way or the other 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.680
 so that's what it was 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.240
 connections for your playstation so 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.660
 after you need to touch the 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.220
 sore it's easy age is here 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:55.400
 but if not I'll plug it in after we go 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.349
 finally you understood me then 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.360
 we on this side we call the l 

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:01.010
 business on ps3 has nothing to do and on 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:04.960
 xbox you just have to be washed in at the 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:08.319
 place there and you plug in hd 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:11.289
 hdmi hdmi on the xbox then once 

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:12.009
 that we plugged the guen capture hd on 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:15.220
 the playstation 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:17.560
 what we do is we plug into 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:19.830
 the pc you take the 4 pc is aiming before 

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.240
 just now the usb cable 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:25.270
 so here we see the tip we see 

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.580
 the usb tip here so what do we do 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.539
 plug the small end into the small end 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.990
 say little hole but that would have made a 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:35.259
 little weird 

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:36.910
 so here we plugged it in and then my 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:38.979
 jewel film with my pc i plugged into 

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:41.710
 canvas it's just so then 

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:43.360
 we plug the end of this usb cable on 

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:47.620
 the pc so in a usb port all 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.389
 just hop it's done and then this 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.020
 which just misses one thing is to 

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:54.610
 plug in the TV go the cake so 

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.050
 it's super simple you longchamp hdmi 

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:57.580
 on the other hand so I hope you have 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.930
 a hdmi port behind otherwise it's not going the 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:01.630
 do but I believe that if you are 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:04.030
 still in vga there must be some 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:07.630
 vga hdmi converters but I was passing 

00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:10.900
 the quality finally a short hdmi so in 

00:07:07.630 --> 00:07:13.630
 pardon branch shows you so hdmi out 

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:17.050
 you see well no and there I show you 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:20.229
 shit here I was thinking I 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:22.030
 hold off the shit hdmi out and bat out 

00:07:20.229 --> 00:07:24.280
 it's for TV he knows for 

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:25.750
 call it where is the end the xbox 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.340
 you understood me so you have to 

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:28.960
 you plugged the cake into hdmi if 

00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.099
 the other end hdmi it will go in your TV 

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:31.169
 so me behind them so I'm not going 

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.490
 do it now 

00:07:31.169 --> 00:07:35.259
 but once you've done that, 

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.789
 branches floats the connections are 

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:40.750
 finished I mean the branches but 

00:07:36.789 --> 00:07:43.599
 it was weird and so there the cake 

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:45.520
 is plugged in and now but I'm going 

00:07:43.599 --> 00:07:46.750
 cut this sequence and show you a 

00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:50.550
 shortly after how is it going on the 

00:07:46.750 --> 00:07:50.550
 playstation has the advantages immediately
