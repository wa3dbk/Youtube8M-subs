 with whom you also play up 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.240
 can and today we have as all 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.400
 First time a bit full on 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.199
 start did fully own a levelsystem 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.539

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.279
 you can come up very quickly 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.140
 like and how was the sheep that betrayed 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.480
 I should you first of all 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.309
 use their so-called burn cards 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.079

 then can equip the Main Menu while 

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:48.420
 do you have the possibility over the 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.819
 leave up to three places too 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.339
 occupy and corresponding cards 

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:55.019
 create an xp boost for you 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:56.519
 there are different for example the 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.309
 firing of enemy clans 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:00.690
 enemy ki or enemy titan 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:02.309
 and so you can if you have this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.559
 that you can do that at the beginning 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.869
 a game over the b key or 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.270
 while you came in the def after one 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.219
 death you can choose these cards 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.439
 and they will go to the next one 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:15.719
 respawn activated by you can you 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.670
 to collect a good book stan eby and 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.450
 Take it to the next level more 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.649
 catch up 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.210
 the second point which also the 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:22.680
 the most important is the fulfillment 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.479
 of challenges 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.670
 These can also be found in the menu 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:29.130
 see and refers to 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.710
 general stuff like games like this 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.329
 this mode or leave on the title 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.009

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.350
 diverse challenge for all 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.780
 weapon types and the classic is 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.079
 Of course, there are so many kills 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.969
 pilots or spectors or frontline soldiers 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.700
 These can be easily done 

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:49.950
 how do you even get damned for npcs 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.929
 high points resp 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.969

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:56.189
 you see several thousand points 

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.109
 make so that he can if you always 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.369
 keep in mind which challenge 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:00.960
 I have not unlocked yet 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.700
 or which is located 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.380
 just in the beginning and is easy 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.780
 you should unlock your own 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.340
 weapon switchen or your playing style short 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.590
 a little bit from the end just this 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.510
 complete requirements and thus 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.430
 murderously 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.769
 to collect experience points and if 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.269
 her further tips and stingy 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.709
 I would advise you to have some time 

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.510
 take a quick look at the abo button 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:21.769
 anger to miss anything or always 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:26.110
 to stay up to date 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:26.110
 in this sense malware target in the eye
