work<00:02:17.769> really<00:02:18.099> good<00:02:18.459> they<00:02:18.849> produce<00:02:19.090> a<00:02:19.510> huge

amount<00:02:20.050> of<00:02:20.110> biomass<00:02:20.290> in<00:02:20.709> a<00:02:20.800> short<00:02:21.099> time<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
amount of biomass in a short time and

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.940 
amount of biomass in a short time and
they<00:02:22.269> work<00:02:22.480> really<00:02:22.900> well<00:02:23.050> as<00:02:23.410> summer<00:02:23.680> cover

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950 
they work really well as summer cover

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.119 
they work really well as summer cover

broccoli or cabbage another thing that I

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.880 
broccoli or cabbage another thing that I
found<00:02:30.489> is<00:02:30.790> crimson<00:02:31.599> clover<00:02:31.959> and<00:02:32.200> barley<00:02:32.620> you

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
found is crimson clover and barley you

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.220 
found is crimson clover and barley you
can<00:02:32.920> get<00:02:33.340> huge<00:02:33.819> amounts<00:02:34.330> of<00:02:34.420> biomass<00:02:34.930> and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
can get huge amounts of biomass and

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
can get huge amounts of biomass and
nitrogen<00:02:35.950> from<00:02:36.280> the<00:02:36.340> crimson<00:02:36.819> clover<00:02:37.030> and<00:02:37.330> it

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
nitrogen from the crimson clover and it

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.500 
nitrogen from the crimson clover and it
will<00:02:37.930> come<00:02:38.319> in<00:02:38.440> earlier<00:02:38.950> like<00:02:39.340> three<00:02:39.879> weeks<00:02:40.180> or

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
will come in earlier like three weeks or

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.199 
will come in earlier like three weeks or
more<00:02:40.720> earlier<00:02:41.230> than<00:02:41.590> than<00:02:42.310> hairy<00:02:42.640> vetch<00:02:42.879> and

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
more earlier than than hairy vetch and

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.789 
more earlier than than hairy vetch and
so<00:02:43.360> you<00:02:43.450> can<00:02:43.660> use<00:02:43.900> this<00:02:44.110> for<00:02:44.290> your<00:02:44.440> early

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
so you can use this for your early

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.229 
so you can use this for your early
summer<00:02:45.069> crops<00:02:45.400> and<00:02:45.700> we've<00:02:45.819> been<00:02:46.209> very

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
summer crops and we've been very

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.200 
summer crops and we've been very
successful<00:02:46.720> with
