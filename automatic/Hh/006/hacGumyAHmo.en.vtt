I

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.680 

everyone<00:00:06.030> so<00:00:06.990> I<00:00:07.880> just<00:00:08.880> came<00:00:09.030> back<00:00:09.180> to<00:00:09.389> the<00:00:09.480> mall

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
everyone so I just came back to the mall

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.250 
everyone so I just came back to the mall
and<00:00:09.960> I<00:00:10.830> decided<00:00:11.730> to<00:00:11.850> do<00:00:12.090> a<00:00:12.120> haul<00:00:12.389> video<00:00:12.570> because

and I decided to do a haul video because

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.859 
and I decided to do a haul video because
I<00:00:13.740> had<00:00:14.280> looked<00:00:15.000> through<00:00:15.180> my<00:00:15.209> channel<00:00:15.750> and<00:00:15.780> I

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:15.869 
I had looked through my channel and I

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:18.890 
I had looked through my channel and I
realized<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:17.330> even<00:00:18.330> though<00:00:18.570> I've<00:00:18.660> been<00:00:18.810> on

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
realized that even though I've been on

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.210 
realized that even though I've been on
YouTube<00:00:19.110> for<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:19.619> time<00:00:19.830> I<00:00:19.860> had<00:00:20.070> never

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
YouTube for all this time I had never

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.290 
YouTube for all this time I had never
done<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.520> haul<00:00:20.699> video<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.980> I'm<00:00:22.980> always<00:00:23.300> looking

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
done a haul video and I'm always looking

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.240 
done a haul video and I'm always looking
for<00:00:24.750> who<00:00:24.930> deals<00:00:25.200> and<00:00:25.470> finding<00:00:25.860> things<00:00:26.010> on<00:00:26.220> a

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
for who deals and finding things on a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 
for who deals and finding things on a
budget<00:00:26.460> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.500> thought<00:00:28.500> it<00:00:28.650> would<00:00:28.710> be

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
budget so I thought it would be

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.920 
budget so I thought it would be
interesting<00:00:29.840> to<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.170> haul<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.660> it's<00:00:33.660> kind

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.530 
boots like especially the combat boots
are<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.410> really<00:01:59.220> good

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:02.540 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.270 

because<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.630> ones<00:02:03.840> that<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.080> had<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.770> they

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
because the ones that I had are they

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.120 
because the ones that I had are they
still<00:02:05.549> look<00:02:05.850> fairly<00:02:06.750> decent<00:02:07.320> I<00:02:07.439> had<00:02:07.650> them<00:02:07.860> for

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
still look fairly decent I had them for

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:10.160 
still look fairly decent I had them for
almost<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.940> year<00:02:08.970> and<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.300> half<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.750> they<00:02:09.959> had

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
almost a year and a half and they had

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
almost a year and a half and they had
still<00:02:10.470> held<00:02:11.009> up<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.940> they're<00:02:12.090> really<00:02:12.239> good

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
still held up and they're really good

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.470 
still held up and they're really good
against<00:02:12.989> so<00:02:13.950> I<00:02:14.310> thought<00:02:14.880> that<00:02:14.940> these<00:02:15.180> will<00:02:15.390> be

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
against so I thought that these will be

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.610 
against so I thought that these will be
a<00:02:15.510> good<00:02:15.690> investment<00:02:16.170> since<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:19.020> don't<00:02:19.200> want<00:02:19.440> a

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
a good investment since you don't want a

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.350 
a good investment since you don't want a
pair<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.950> shoes<00:02:20.160> i'm<00:02:20.340> just<00:02:20.940> going<00:02:21.090> to<00:02:21.120> fall

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
pair of shoes i'm just going to fall

jacket<00:02:35.269> since<00:02:36.269> camouflage<00:02:36.930> is<00:02:37.140> on<00:02:37.260> trend<00:02:37.560> I

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
jacket since camouflage is on trend I

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.920 
jacket since camouflage is on trend I
thought<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.190> would<00:02:38.280> be<00:02:38.660> good<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.720> get

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
thought it would be good to get

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.340 
thought it would be good to get
something<00:02:40.140> like<00:02:40.410> this<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:41.840> yeah<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.170> it's

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
something like this and yeah so it's

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.990 
something like this and yeah so it's
kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.650> it<00:02:44.040> has<00:02:44.160> a<00:02:44.190> little<00:02:44.430> distressed

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
kind of like it has a little distressed

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.610 
kind of like it has a little distressed
look<00:02:45.390> if<00:02:46.200> that<00:02:46.380> makes<00:02:46.560> any<00:02:46.709> sense<00:02:47.330> so<00:02:48.500> even<00:02:49.500> if

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
look if that makes any sense so even if

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.370 
look if that makes any sense so even if
I<00:02:49.739> wash<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.280> it'll<00:02:50.610> probably<00:02:50.790> still<00:02:51.180> look<00:02:52.019> okay

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.580 

but<00:04:53.850> there<00:04:54.120> was

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:01.679 

there's<00:04:58.130> like<00:04:58.280> 10<00:04:58.610> minutes<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:59.780> very<00:04:59.990> small

00:05:01.679 --> 00:05:01.689 
there's like 10 minutes it's very small

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:08.669 
there's like 10 minutes it's very small
in<00:05:02.080> this<00:05:02.289> verse<00:05:02.499> 14<00:05:02.979> 15<00:05:07.259> think<00:05:08.259> both<00:05:08.439> of<00:05:08.469> these

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:08.679 
in this verse 14 15 think both of these

00:05:08.679 --> 00:05:11.189 
in this verse 14 15 think both of these
different<00:05:09.009> on<00:05:09.809> both<00:05:10.809> of<00:05:10.839> these<00:05:11.019> different

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
different on both of these different

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.950 
different on both of these different
rings<00:05:11.619> sets<00:05:12.329> for<00:05:13.329> 1450

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
rings sets for 1450

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.650 
rings sets for 1450
but<00:05:16.530> I<00:05:16.560> think<00:05:16.919> that<00:05:17.009> says<00:05:17.400> you<00:05:17.639> get<00:05:17.850> about<00:05:18.270> 10

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
but I think that says you get about 10

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.629 
but I think that says you get about 10
