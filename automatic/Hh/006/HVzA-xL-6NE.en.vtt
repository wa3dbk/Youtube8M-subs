 hello everyone my name is din shevchenko and 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:36.920
 Today we will analyze with you a banana song 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.160
 b-side robert king with his eponymous 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:44.120
 '67 album a couple of words about Andarza 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:47.870
 king this blues monster is one of the most 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.440
 copied guitarists both blues and in 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.780
 roque 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:54.470
 with its own unique 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.629
 phrasing and with so many introductions 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.360
 which was used later 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.549
 very many blues as i said already 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.699
 the fateful guitarist and in this video we 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.530
 let 's break the reef this songs and the next we 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:10.490
 analyze the component 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:13.310
 immediately say that it is all played in 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.170
 other media nori than the main inaccuracy 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.470
 when some bands try to play 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.360
 This song they melt play in some not 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.939
 operated keys for example 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:28.510
 dollars and lira that is either a tone higher 

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:28.510
 there was a tone lower and they play something like this 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.390
 with both the guitar and the bass it 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.850
 wrong because one of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.280
 the appeal of this myth is that 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:48.710
 we have an open string constantly and 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.470
 all this is played rather lower by 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.150
 the territory is also a plus 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.890
 what's the guitar on this organ 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.920
 record steve crop 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.080
 one of the creators of booker ti ji so 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:04.360
 that composition there is very good steve very 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.360
 competent guitarist as it sounds from their 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:14.350
 the right hand invites us to the strings 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.350
 bridge area 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.400
 instead 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.540
 the pick we play all the time down 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:40.970
 here we play the first 3 fingers on 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:47.330
 what to disassemble the reef the first part we begin 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:51.980
 sixth string 2 fret 4 third finger on 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:58.160
 5 string second lumber finger it 4 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.610
 the third finger on the fourth string 2 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:06.130
 fret and back to fifth to fourth fret 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.130
 we pinch this third finger again 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:12.100
 this is the first part of the reef slowly again 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:21.290
 the next part is where it is actually 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.620
 an open string arises 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:29.720
 also begins the sixth string 2 fret 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:33.920
 index finger the third finger on 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:38.000
 fourth fret 6 strings and then 5 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.110
 string 2 fret index finger and here 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.420
 now the sixth string is open and again on 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:52.450
 5 string 4 third finger 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.450
 one more time slowly 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:00.250
 now all this is slowly connecting a 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.729
 Now let 's look at the approach to the lady find 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:33.230
 no we will have for flat 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:38.780
 and then here we play 8 frets 5 strings and 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:43.250
 first finger once second finger 9 5 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:50.080
 strings and a third finger are 10 lat 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:50.080
 already fingers 11 fret 1 2 3 4 1 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.389
 here we take the accord 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:02.139
 For flat si the third finger on the 1st fret 5 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:07.220
 strings and 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:10.040
 2 pass on the tenth fret 4 strings third 

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:12.229
 finger on the 11th fret the third string and 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:14.860
 first finger on the ninth fret second 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:14.860
 strings 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:39.069
 then we turn on the background of 7 after 

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:46.020
 every time we hit and invite 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:46.020
 right hand and again 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:04.640
 back upstairs slowly again 

00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:37.920
 and one more moment on the verses we play 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:40.380
 will simplified reef it sounds so then 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.170
 there are four times what we play again 

00:06:40.380 --> 00:06:45.750
 we are jamming strings in 2 bridge 

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:51.840
 sixth string 4 fret of the sixth string and 

00:06:45.750 --> 00:06:56.900
 second lot of 5 strings and more then semi 

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.900
 second fret once and for 4 5 strings and 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.180
 again do not forget to eat like I already 

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:11.520
 said and after four times when we 

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:14.000
 played this forgive reef again 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.000
 begins 

00:07:20.719 --> 00:07:24.110
 well then 

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:30.350
 what we have already gone before and 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:33.530
 so in this video we have disassembled 

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:35.740
