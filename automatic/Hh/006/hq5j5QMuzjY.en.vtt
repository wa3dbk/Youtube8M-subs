00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.600 

and<00:02:02.400> my<00:02:03.210> next<00:02:03.360> one<00:02:03.600> starts<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:06.110> ok<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.220> that's

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and my next one starts here ok so that's

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:18.040 
and my next one starts here ok so that's
that's<00:02:09.179> it<00:02:14.450> does<00:02:15.450> that<00:02:15.690> see<00:02:15.930> the<00:02:16.020> sign<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:17.130> um<00:02:17.459> I
