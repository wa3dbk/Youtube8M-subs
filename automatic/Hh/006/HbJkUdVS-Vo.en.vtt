 already arrived and will be played music 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.450

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.880
 totals say i feel at 60 i 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.670

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.629
 according to american ross he with 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.400
 gladly accepted the offer 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.060

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.530
 doubting 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.689
 and don't pay attention to what 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.560
 Regarding Russia, I will not survive 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:24.480
 better times 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.609
 I smiled, I would really like 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.560
 so that music was a universal language 

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:31.230
 which brings people together regardless 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.510
 from country and nationality or religion 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.579
 I believe that music can do it 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.590

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:39.629
 passion is life petena causes 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.480
 people have the same feeling around the world 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.760
 life the same thought repeats another

 foreign guest belgian singer 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.169
 Lara Fabian Whose creative tandem with 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.669
 Ukrainians by birth became steep igor 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:53.340
 those conductors due to which 

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:55.730
 modern Russian music will be recognized on 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:55.730
 west 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.360
 but 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.969
 of moms without i can confidently say that 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.579
 Igor is a cool one of the best composers 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.469
 with whom I've ever been small 

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.659
 the child in me certainly wants to say he 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:14.599
 my composer I can't it would be 

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:16.609
 too really value time

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:33.090
 i came with a youthful feeling 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:35.280
 street solidarity because it is for 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.879
 me this is the most that neither is 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:42.480
 honesty in what he does and in 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:45.720
 life and in his work and not for me 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.400
 it is equally important to play a phrase from his 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:53.160
 songs rather than play the first measure 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.440
 Godâ€™s work is harder than 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:57.420
 pop music but understandable enough for 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:59.700
 wide audience here is a stage 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.650
 meets with classics experts 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.959
 call this style a crossover that is 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.700
 the intersection of two elements and in these two 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.959
 evenings viewers will be able to see how on
