00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:09.800 
around it's got the PTO winch on there

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.440 
around it's got the PTO winch on there
it's<00:00:10.800> crazy<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.490> only<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.730> 10k<00:00:12.150> winch

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
it's crazy that it's only a 10k winch

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.749 
it's crazy that it's only a 10k winch
but<00:00:12.750> I<00:00:12.780> heard<00:00:12.960> that<00:00:13.200> military<00:00:13.710> the<00:00:14.460> way<00:00:14.610> they

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
but I heard that military the way they

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.490 
but I heard that military the way they
rate<00:00:14.969> things<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.509> a<00:00:15.750> lot<00:00:16.080> different<00:00:16.470> than

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
rate things is a lot different than

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.279 
rate things is a lot different than
civilian<00:00:17.250> versions<00:00:17.670> so<00:00:17.900> maybe<00:00:18.900> it'll<00:00:19.080> pull<00:00:19.260> a

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
civilian versions so maybe it'll pull a

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.800 
civilian versions so maybe it'll pull a
lot<00:00:19.439> more<00:00:19.619> than<00:00:19.740> that<00:00:19.830> on<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.779> but<00:00:21.779> uh

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
lot more than that on on that but uh

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.630 
lot more than that on on that but uh
yeah<00:00:22.350> it's<00:00:22.500> got<00:00:22.619> some<00:00:22.650> multi-fuel<00:00:23.160> engine<00:00:23.369> in

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
yeah it's got some multi-fuel engine in

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.609 
yeah it's got some multi-fuel engine in
it<00:00:23.760> it<00:00:24.060> is<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.240> non<00:00:24.510> turbo<00:00:24.750> that's<00:00:25.410> why<00:00:25.560> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it it is a non turbo that's why the

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.349 
it it is a non turbo that's why the
exhaust<00:00:26.010> is<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.369> tiny<00:00:26.580> over<00:00:26.880> there<00:00:27.000> compared

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
exhaust is so tiny over there compared

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.019 
exhaust is so tiny over there compared
to<00:00:27.449> most<00:00:27.599> two<00:00:27.840> snaps<00:00:28.490> but<00:00:29.490> it<00:00:29.609> pulls<00:00:29.820> its

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
to most two snaps but it pulls its

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.840 
to most two snaps but it pulls its
weight<00:00:30.179> pretty<00:00:30.390> fun<00:00:31.460> it's<00:00:32.460> got<00:00:32.579> the<00:00:32.730> little

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
weight pretty fun it's got the little

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.479 
weight pretty fun it's got the little
pee<00:00:33.540> thing<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:33.989> there<00:00:34.170> it<00:00:34.380> had<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.620> white<00:00:35.160> one<00:00:35.340> on

bomb crane is actually a little bit

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.070 
bomb crane is actually a little bit
longer<00:01:25.820> than<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.000> number<00:01:27.240> seven<00:01:27.509> record<00:01:27.780> but

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
longer than the number seven record but

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.560 
longer than the number seven record but
uh<00:01:28.400> I'm<00:01:29.400> sure<00:01:29.430> you<00:01:29.970> know<00:01:30.090> they<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.420> they

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
uh I'm sure you know they you they

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.060 
uh I'm sure you know they you they
probably<00:01:30.720> use<00:01:31.020> it<00:01:31.140> for<00:01:31.170> whatever<00:01:31.470> back<00:01:31.860> in<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
probably use it for whatever back in the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.740 
probably use it for whatever back in the
day<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:34.310> think<00:01:35.310> those<00:01:35.549> tires<00:01:35.820> are<00:01:35.909> like<00:01:36.060> 38<00:01:36.509> or

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
day I think those tires are like 38 or

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:37.940 
day I think those tires are like 38 or
something<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.350> that's<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.710> stock

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
something like that that's the stock

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.819 
something like that that's the stock

gas<00:02:10.730> which<00:02:11.730> I<00:02:12.060> don't<00:02:12.660> know<00:02:12.750> this<00:02:12.930> truck

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
gas which I don't know this truck

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.600 
gas which I don't know this truck
probably<00:02:13.170> get<00:02:13.530> something<00:02:13.740> like<00:02:13.980> 9<00:02:14.130> miles<00:02:14.400> per

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
probably get something like 9 miles per

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.640 
probably get something like 9 miles per
gallon<00:02:14.930> it's<00:02:15.930> not<00:02:16.050> the<00:02:16.170> best<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.500> the<00:02:16.530> world

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
gallon it's not the best in the world

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.680 
gallon it's not the best in the world
but<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.280> think<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.850> military<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:18.420> cared

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
but I think the military really cared

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.840 
but I think the military really cared
about<00:02:18.750> gas<00:02:19.080> mileage<00:02:19.500> and<00:02:20.280> they<00:02:20.430> made<00:02:20.610> them<00:02:20.730> so

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
about gas mileage and they made them so

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.140 
about gas mileage and they made them so
I'll<00:02:23.850> show<00:02:24.030> you<00:02:24.060> some<00:02:24.180> underneath<00:02:25.040> you<00:02:26.150> it's

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
person that told me it was pretty

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.250 
person that told me it was pretty
knowledgeable<00:02:45.989> in<00:02:46.350> military<00:02:46.770> stuff<00:02:47.040> so<00:02:48.260> no

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
knowledgeable in military stuff so no

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.010 
knowledgeable in military stuff so no
reason<00:02:49.560> to<00:02:49.620> go<00:02:49.770> against<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.840> that's<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> a

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
reason to go against that that's the a

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.610 
reason to go against that that's the a
action<00:02:52.739> shovel<00:02:53.239> holder<00:02:54.239> thing<00:02:54.450> they<00:02:55.410> call<00:02:55.560> it

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
action shovel holder thing they call it

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.120 
action shovel holder thing they call it
a<00:02:55.650> pioneer<00:02:56.010> rack<00:02:57.410> it<00:02:58.410> does<00:02:58.440> have<00:02:58.769> some<00:02:58.920> rust

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
a pioneer rack it does have some rust

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.970 
a pioneer rack it does have some rust
damage<00:02:59.370> on<00:02:59.640> it<00:02:59.840> not<00:03:00.840> bad<00:03:01.080> there<00:03:01.440> that's<00:03:01.860> like

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
damage on it not bad there that's like

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.289 
damage on it not bad there that's like
the<00:03:02.130> only<00:03:02.220> spot<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.730> it's<00:03:02.850> not<00:03:02.970> rusted

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
the only spot and it's not rusted

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:06.080 
the only spot and it's not rusted
through<00:03:03.920> yes<00:03:04.920> it<00:03:05.070> was<00:03:05.190> 2<00:03:05.340> layers<00:03:05.549> of<00:03:05.640> metal<00:03:05.880> or

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
through yes it was 2 layers of metal or

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:07.270 
through yes it was 2 layers of metal or
something

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
something

something
it's<00:03:08.280> pretty<00:03:08.459> cool<00:03:08.610> how<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.760> suspension

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
it's pretty cool how the suspension

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.740 
it's pretty cool how the suspension
works<00:03:09.390> on<00:03:09.630> these<00:03:10.400> he<00:03:11.400> just<00:03:11.549> hooks<00:03:11.730> up<00:03:11.940> and<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
works on these he just hooks up and the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.120 
works on these he just hooks up and the
weight<00:03:12.930> of<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.140> truck<00:03:13.380> sits<00:03:13.650> on<00:03:13.799> this<00:03:13.890> one

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130 
weight of the truck sits on this one

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:16.460 
weight of the truck sits on this one
center<00:03:14.489> point<00:03:14.700> right<00:03:14.910> here<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.690> as<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.110> as<00:03:16.320> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
center point right here and as it as it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.890 
center point right here and as it as it
goes<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.830> articulates<00:03:17.489> off-road<00:03:17.940> he<00:03:18.660> just

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
goes and articulates off-road he just

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.570 
goes and articulates off-road he just
flexes<00:03:19.350> back<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.709> forth<00:03:19.950> on<00:03:20.160> that<00:03:20.220> center

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
flexes back and forth on that center

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.820 
flexes back and forth on that center
point<00:03:20.760> so<00:03:21.720> it<00:03:21.780> has<00:03:21.900> really<00:03:22.170> good<00:03:22.350> flex<00:03:22.650> in<00:03:22.799> the

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
point so it has really good flex in the

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.710 
point so it has really good flex in the
rear<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.610> only<00:03:23.790> thing<00:03:24.000> is<00:03:24.150> with<00:03:24.269> these<00:03:24.420> trucks

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
rear the only thing is with these trucks

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.140 
rear the only thing is with these trucks
if<00:03:25.380> you<00:03:25.470> get<00:03:25.620> the<00:03:25.739> front-end<00:03:26.100> stuff<00:03:26.340> is<00:03:26.850> game

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
if you get the front-end stuff is game

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.890 
if you get the front-end stuff is game
over<00:03:27.380> it's<00:03:28.380> just<00:03:28.650> stuck<00:03:29.239> but<00:03:30.239> luckily<00:03:30.450> this<00:03:30.720> is

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
over it's just stuck but luckily this is

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.120 
over it's just stuck but luckily this is
the<00:03:30.989> PTO<00:03:31.320> truck<00:03:31.940> at<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.030> PTO<00:03:33.329> winch<00:03:33.920> my<00:03:34.920> last

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
the PTO truck at the PTO winch my last

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.380 
the PTO truck at the PTO winch my last
deuce<00:03:35.340> and<00:03:35.459> a<00:03:35.519> half<00:03:35.549> actually<00:03:35.820> got<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.239> stuck

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
deuce and a half actually got it stuck

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:38.030 
deuce and a half actually got it stuck
one<00:03:36.630> time<00:03:36.840> it<00:03:37.019> didn't<00:03:37.230> have<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.350> winch<00:03:37.590> on<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:37.799> so

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
one time it didn't have a winch on it so

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.220 
one time it didn't have a winch on it so
that<00:03:38.790> was<00:03:38.940> really<00:03:39.209> scary<00:03:39.630> we<00:03:39.780> had<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.959> hook<00:03:40.110> up

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
that was really scary we had to hook up

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.130 
that was really scary we had to hook up
two<00:03:40.410> jeeps<00:03:40.680> and<00:03:41.610> they<00:03:41.670> dodged<00:03:42.360> power<00:03:42.750> wagon

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
two jeeps and they dodged power wagon

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.350 
two jeeps and they dodged power wagon
like<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> new<00:03:43.860> body<00:03:44.100> new<00:03:44.549> like<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.150> don't<00:03:45.299> know

like a new body new like I don't know

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.860 
like a new body new like I don't know
think<00:03:45.600> it<00:03:45.660> was<00:03:45.750> 80s<00:03:46.049> model<00:03:46.380> Dodge<00:03:47.040> Power<00:03:47.340> Wagon

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
like two hours and finally they got it

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.140

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
out got very lucky because the back

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.430 
out got very lucky because the back
tires<00:03:54.390> were<00:03:54.570> on<00:03:54.690> something<00:03:54.900> drive<00:03:55.170> around<00:03:57.440> see

if<00:03:58.500> I<00:03:58.590> can<00:03:58.680> get<00:03:58.769> it<00:03:58.889> inside<00:03:59.250> the<00:03:59.489> bed<00:04:00.120> view

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
if I can get it inside the bed view
