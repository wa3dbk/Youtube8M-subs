00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
do is open a new composition and choose

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.500 
do is open a new composition and choose
with<00:00:19.830> a<00:00:19.859> choose<00:00:20.310> your<00:00:20.400> settings<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:21.150> this<00:00:21.420> is

my optimal settings so click OK and then
what<00:00:25.980> you're<00:00:26.099> going<00:00:26.189> to<00:00:26.310> do<00:00:26.490> is<00:00:26.699> choose<00:00:27.210> one<00:00:27.449> of

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
what you're going to do is choose one of

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.339 
what you're going to do is choose one of
the<00:00:27.750> stock<00:00:28.560> footages<00:00:29.250> by<00:00:29.429> videocopilot<00:00:30.179> in<00:00:30.630> my

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
the stock footages by videocopilot in my

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.370 
the stock footages by videocopilot in my
case<00:00:31.590> I'm<00:00:31.769> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:31.949> choose<00:00:32.130> shockwave<00:00:32.640> 23<00:00:33.390> so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
case I'm going to choose shockwave 23 so

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.530 
case I'm going to choose shockwave 23 so
add<00:00:34.770> it<00:00:35.040> to<00:00:35.190> your<00:00:35.690> composition<00:00:36.690> and<00:00:37.760> then<00:00:38.760> what

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
add it to your composition and then what

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.540 
add it to your composition and then what
you're<00:00:39.660> going<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.809> see<00:00:39.989> is<00:00:40.290> just<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.800> plain

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
you're going to see is just a plain

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.380 
you're going to see is just a plain
black<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:42.000> white<00:00:42.300> shockwave<00:00:43.489> so<00:00:44.489> one<00:00:45.180> method

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
black and white shockwave so one method

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.350 
black and white shockwave so one method
is<00:00:45.829> are<00:00:47.149> changing<00:00:48.469> your<00:00:49.469> arm<00:00:50.210> blending<00:00:51.210> mode

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
is are changing your arm blending mode

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.869 
is are changing your arm blending mode
to<00:00:51.390> add<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:52.100> just<00:00:53.100> adding<00:00:53.520> some<00:00:53.699> color

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
to add and just adding some color

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.910 
to add and just adding some color
correction<00:00:54.360> to<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.600> but<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.649> isn't<00:00:55.890> very

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
correction to it but that isn't very

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.520 
correction to it but that isn't very
effective<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:56.699> when<00:00:57.690> you<00:00:57.809> add<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> on<00:00:58.260> top

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
effective because when you add it on top

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.869 
effective because when you add it on top
of<00:00:58.559> another<00:00:58.710> layer<00:00:59.129> you'll<00:00:59.399> see<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.730> there's

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
of another layer you'll see that there's

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.029 
of another layer you'll see that there's
going<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.059> be<00:01:00.120> some<00:01:00.329> highlights<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.050> blues

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
going to be some highlights of blues

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.960 
going to be some highlights of blues
particles<00:01:02.609> that's<00:01:02.730> our<00:01:04.519> life<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.820> just

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
particles that's our life so I'm just

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.370 
particles that's our life so I'm just
loose<00:01:06.390> particles<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.840> come<00:01:06.990> out<00:01:07.110> from<00:01:07.290> the

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
loose particles that come out from the

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.490 
loose particles that come out from the
shockwave<00:01:07.939> so<00:01:08.939> well<00:01:09.360> my<00:01:09.659> effective<00:01:10.170> method

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
shockwave so well my effective method

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.359 
shockwave so well my effective method
that's<00:01:10.950> 100<00:01:11.369> percent<00:01:12.530> just<00:01:13.530> limited<00:01:14.100> to<00:01:14.130> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that's 100 percent just limited to the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.820 
that's 100 percent just limited to the
particles<00:01:14.850> within<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.990> thing<00:01:16.229> not<00:01:16.560> just<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
particles within that thing not just the

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.539 
particles within that thing not just the
particles<00:01:17.189> go<00:01:17.340> out<00:01:17.490> is<00:01:18.830> this<00:01:19.830> way<00:01:19.979> so<00:01:20.009> what

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
particles go out is this way so what

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.469 
particles go out is this way so what
you're<00:01:20.640> going<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.790> do<00:01:20.909> is<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.180> change<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
you're going to do is just change it

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.320 
you're going to do is just change it
back<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> normal<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:22.170> then<00:01:23.030> you're<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
back to normal and then you're going to

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.020 
back to normal and then you're going to
go<00:01:24.840> on<00:01:24.930> layer<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:26.600> make<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> new<00:01:28.020> solid<00:01:28.290> and

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
go on layer and make a new solid and

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.190 
go on layer and make a new solid and
then<00:01:30.030> call<00:01:30.329> yourselves<00:01:30.540> whatever<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.049> want

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
then call yourselves whatever you want

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.270 
then call yourselves whatever you want
but<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.409> going<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.590> call<00:01:31.740> this<00:01:31.829> tutorial

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:32.280 
but it's going to call this tutorial

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.730 
but it's going to call this tutorial
colors<00:01:32.610> so<00:01:33.650> tutorial<00:01:34.650> colors<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.740> here's

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
colors so tutorial colors and here's

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.039 
colors so tutorial colors and here's
here's<00:01:38.159> an<00:01:38.280> important<00:01:38.579> part<00:01:38.820> make<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.840> color

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
here's an important part make the color

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.749 
here's an important part make the color
the<00:01:40.229> solids<00:01:40.590> what<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.130> your<00:01:41.310> shockwave

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the solids what you want your shockwave

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.760 
the solids what you want your shockwave
to<00:01:41.909> be<00:01:42.030> so<00:01:42.270> I'm<00:01:42.990> just<00:01:43.110> going<00:01:43.229> to<00:01:43.320> choose<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.530> nice

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
to be so I'm just going to choose a nice

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.130 
to be so I'm just going to choose a nice
stalkers<00:01:44.670> color<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.149> then<00:01:45.689> make<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:46.020> to

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
stalkers color and then make sure to

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.030 
stalkers color and then make sure to
click<00:01:46.290> arm<00:01:46.649> it<00:01:46.979> complies<00:01:47.509> click<00:01:48.509> OK<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.040> then

click arm it complies click OK and then
here's<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.369> tricky<00:01:50.549> part<00:01:50.960> what<00:01:51.960> you<00:01:52.079> going<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
here's the tricky part what you going to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.940 
here's the tricky part what you going to
do<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.619> pull<00:01:53.070> tutorials<00:01:53.700> under<00:01:53.909> shockwave<00:01:54.540> and

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 
do is pull tutorials under shockwave and

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.429 
do is pull tutorials under shockwave and
then<00:01:55.950> go<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.369> track<00:01:56.610> Matt<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.229> click<00:01:58.229> on

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
then go and track Matt and click on

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.410 
then go and track Matt and click on
limit<00:01:58.920> Matt<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.729> name<00:01:59.880> of<00:01:59.909> your<00:02:00.000> footage

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
limit Matt and the name of your footage

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.719 
limit Matt and the name of your footage

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
you click on one of these doesn't really

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.580 
you click on one of these doesn't really
do<00:02:07.740> much<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> what<00:02:10.110> you're<00:02:10.229> going<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.410> do<00:02:10.500> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
do much so what you're going to do is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.780 
do much so what you're going to do is
