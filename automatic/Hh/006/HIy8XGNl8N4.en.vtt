00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.210
 hi to all these crimes how are you 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:21.649
 finds himself today for a 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.300
 new video I introduced you so 

00:00:21.649 --> 00:00:24.919
 a little tutorial where I'm going to 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.429
 present ten rules of survival is 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.439
 essential 

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.789
 so on this call of duty has in this 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.439
 way because there are new small 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.759
 Things there are more old things 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.050
 we will see all this in the video so 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.050
 it's gone we lost too much time 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.180
 then rule number 1 the dash so the 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:43.430
 dash what is it if the 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.300
 right or left lateral displacement or 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.829
 in front behind 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.269
 so we will use it in two cases 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.530
 different either to go to attack 

00:00:47.269 --> 00:00:50.570
 the enemy to defend himself 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.070
 so here I defended myself on this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.780
 overnight overtaking quickly on the 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.759
 left the first few I did 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.199
 choice she quickly look for so in 

00:00:55.759 --> 00:00:58.780
 using the dage I advise you 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.070
 to use in these two different cases 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.479
 use it to jump everywhere and make 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:03.199
 anything is absolutely nothing 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:05.210
 you will die 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.070
 and if you go rage and after you 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.509
 will say I'm bad so here is 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.100
 a little board use the dash for 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.570
 dodge or attack the enemies you 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.840
 see how to train view is really 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 not bad 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.869
 then rule number two with 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.369
 walk along the walls in fact why longer 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.350
 the walls all the enemies are often 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:27.080
 on the walls or on the roofs are 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.820
 often authors and it's complicated for 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.860
 them to eliminate us on along the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.299
 walls so and depending on a maximum the 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.500
 walls of there and doubles and some 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.180
 red dots on the roof use the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:42.320
 dash quickly go get neither for 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.700
 eliminate it then the solid aim is 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.020
 extremely helpful you'll see everything 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.729
 throughout this excerpt I put the 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.439
 enemies very easily so teams 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:49.550
 will try the frame the asset number 2 which 

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.950
 is called france hours actually you 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.289
 will be able to run and shoot everything from 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.119
 following without lifting tears in fact this is what 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:57.380
 that I mean and with the laser sight 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:00.159
 and you will see that you will make big 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.159
 massacre workouts 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 a regulation rule number 4 the drone 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.729
 explosive what is it's a 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.349
 drone we're going to throw the enemies are going 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.910
 pass on it will activate the drone 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.760
 he will go stick to your opponent 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.830
 to eliminate it is something that 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.209
 can be misused but 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.380
 I'm going I explained Prancing 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.790
 is not I sure I play a lot in 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.170
 domination so if every time you 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.300
 take seconds you put on a 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.280
 position whenever an emirate on 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.440
 the position he will be eliminated or 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.440
 fresh mopti massacre 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.079
 then rule number 5 do the tarn have 

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:38.700
 so is it all 

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:40.260
 simple you put behind a wall or 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.329
 billion trash cans that we them 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.980
 finally you put something behind 

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:45.689
 which hides the room in which you 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.010
 want to go in and look at you 

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:48.060
 quickly on the left or on the 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:49.890
 right in it depends where you want 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.480
 to pass to see if precisely there is no 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.730
 issue and a half so you can 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.959
 the illuminated on the several I could 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.609
 to turn around here it's just 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.890
 a little trick to throw a shot 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:00.450
 of eye and line and the opponents get 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.590
 put to the right goes to the left 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:04.200
 and so on as you can the 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.420
 see the gemmi the opponent dies in 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.459
 seeing him arrive before him precisely in 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.989
 using the technique so due to arnaud 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.670
 so I really advise you on that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.620
 you will see that you will do 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.139
 more elimination then you would have 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.139
 had to die before before this trick 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.350
 so flee to better come back it's true 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.790
 that I do not think and that as soon as we 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.320
 takes balls directly on 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:28.580
 try to go on the enemy while 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.020
 in the best way is to go away 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.940
 precisely to be able to come back better 

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.680
 eliminate more easily get in 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.300
 withdrawal know where he exactly 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.690
 and come back and really eliminate it 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.690
 easily 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:44.690
 then do the bac it's not something 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.070
 thing that a lot of people do 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.800
 while it's really something 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:50.330
 that there is to do well in the sense that 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.640
 it is true that we arrive at a position 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:54.230
 sees all enemies who are where 5 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.460
 6 red dots we do not want to 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.660
 take the lead we really want to 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.350
 to go into it to do the maximum 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.970
 immunization 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.950
 but that's exactly where you'll be killed 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.700
 that you are not going to succeed well I 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.170
 your goal 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.430
 at best even if there is a lot of 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.930
 points tell you that if you go you 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.280
 are you going to die that better is going to be 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.050
 to just go to turn your 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.670
 opponents and that there you will be able 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.130
 eliminate them because anyway you 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.500
 go and get eliminated e6 on by 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.269
 example or two against five or six years 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.230
 more after eliminating them in their 

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.870
 back you will be able to more easily 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:22.760
 take the flag so really some 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.930
 thing to do and think about it think about it and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.930
 train yourself Coy 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.250
 then tactical reloading is 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.900
 really something really con 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:35.400
 but it's true that I'm having myself 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.110
 again and I think we have a lot 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.539
 of them that will be to see and that 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.800
 you're going to do an elimination think about 

00:04:39.539 --> 00:04:42.630
 to recharge of course if you are at 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.560
 the shelter if we do not do it because 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.300
 it is true that in this game the ben ali 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.800
 leave extremely alive so think 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:49.080
 really to use their change 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.650
 tactical so as soon as you admire charge 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.650
 at once 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.639
 so what do I call them 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.919
 sing people you'll see the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.210
 blocking meetings I eliminate anemia and 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.319
 I'm going to go just less hidden 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.180
 behind a pilot so my movements 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:06.039
 are they moving and I'm moving 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.090
 exactly like that so I have the flag 

00:05:06.039 --> 00:05:08.440
 is being caught by a 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.330
 enemy you see I will not go 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.650
 so precisely by that the main ones I 

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:13.090
 will go to jump the wall you will see 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.729
 precisely that Lenin was not expecting me 

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:17.620
 so you're going over the wall there I'm trying to 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:19.150
 Anemia I can not do more 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.310
 easy to get around and I'm going 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.660
 precisely the happy have bypassed so 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.610
 and it's really smart thinking 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:25.990
 to illuminate your friends so watch her 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:27.400
 I put a shot in the anti you will see 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.000
 that in many of my imitations that 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.440
 happens like this 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.970
 I always try to go behind 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.009
 the enemy to be able to eliminate it so 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:35.830
 more easily me it'll be still a 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:36.910
 second now slows down so the 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.289
 look again I try to pass 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:40.120
 behind the enemy to be able to 

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.990
 eliminate it more easily when you 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.680
 are in melee and you have 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.449
 no reflexes 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.280
 all this bullshit there and so it's 

00:05:43.449 --> 00:05:47.320
 precisely to go from behind your 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.580
 green vote of rage has arrived towards your 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.380
 enemy again there I come from the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:52.509
 do or think when I talk rush 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:53.860
 smart I really think level of 

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:55.599
 placements have therefore used the dash 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.460
 to move much faster 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.159
 on the enemies have precisely the 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.320
 eliminate by surprise to think of everything 

00:06:00.159 --> 00:06:03.639
 7.6 to all these little tricks and you 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.620
 see that it did not come home alone 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:08.860
 ensures the drive train yourself 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.330
 to all this is this tactic there after I 

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:11.919
 you do other videos regarding the 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.389
 moving it's pretty fast it's 

00:06:11.919 --> 00:06:16.710
 really a little bit of history 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.710
 give you my rule in quotation marks 

00:06:19.549 --> 00:06:23.099
 so do not have the pigeons and yes first 

00:06:21.869 --> 00:06:24.539
 the pigeons in the sense that they were going 

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:26.369
 we will take in a few moments 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.409
 everyone is going badly like a nag 

00:06:26.369 --> 00:06:28.769
 on b without even knowing what's going on 

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:30.899
 around 

00:06:28.769 --> 00:06:32.249
 so let them go there 

00:06:30.899 --> 00:06:34.319
 call the pigeons these people where 

00:06:32.249 --> 00:06:35.189
 they go there they get killed and waited 

00:06:34.319 --> 00:06:38.189
 just one or two people 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.839
 arrive on the goal of beewi your 

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:40.499
 endurance like for all the time I 

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.969
 spoke about the ferry 

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:43.559
 you see that there is a lot of him 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:45.029
 waited for them to have a little less 

00:06:43.559 --> 00:06:46.949
 that you opponents are trying to 

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:48.509
 you are combining his teeth you are precisely 

00:06:46.949 --> 00:06:49.860
 that there are some who get killed and 

00:06:48.509 --> 00:06:51.839
 alesia after you will have less luck 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:53.249
