this is a neat now dude fell in the eye

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.669 
this is a neat now dude fell in the eye
and<00:00:06.240> if<00:00:06.390> that<00:00:06.629> he<00:00:07.020> is<00:00:07.290> less<00:00:07.649> than<00:00:08.040> that<00:00:08.340> then

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
and if that he is less than that then

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:15.440 
and if that he is less than that then
it's<00:00:10.679> going<00:00:10.920> to<00:00:11.040> need<00:00:11.280> more<00:00:13.849> day<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:14.880> them<00:00:15.179> have

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
it's going to need more day of them have

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.650 
it's going to need more day of them have
my<00:00:15.929> ipod<00:00:16.590> or<00:00:16.800> environment<00:00:17.430> 20<00:00:19.910> so<00:00:20.910> if<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.449> can

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
my ipod or environment 20 so if you can

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.720 
my ipod or environment 20 so if you can
eat<00:00:21.840> here<00:00:22.080> too<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.830> we'll<00:00:23.010> see<00:00:23.220> are<00:00:23.400> we<00:00:23.550> have

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
eat here too but we'll see are we have

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.250 
eat here too but we'll see are we have
the<00:00:23.880> second<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> sometimes<00:00:24.930> it<00:00:25.080> is<00:00:25.230> useful

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
the second all it sometimes it is useful

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.509 
the second all it sometimes it is useful
to<00:00:26.539> take<00:00:27.539> way<00:00:27.779> down<00:00:28.109> from<00:00:28.680> this<00:00:28.949> point<00:00:29.220> from

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
to take way down from this point from

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.740 
to take way down from this point from
here<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.769> see<00:00:31.769> if<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.070> guys<00:00:32.279> wanted<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.510> it

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
here and see if you guys wanted to do it

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.299 
here and see if you guys wanted to do it
I<00:00:33.870> don't<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.140> how<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.620> want<00:00:34.890> an

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
I don't know how you really want an

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.170 
I don't know how you really want an
intermediate<00:00:36.829> you<00:00:37.829> can<00:00:38.040> save<00:00:38.250> all<00:00:38.550> that<00:00:38.579> well

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
intermediate you can save all that well

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:53.770 
intermediate you can save all that well
but<00:00:39.840> we<00:00:40.020> didn't<00:00:40.200> act<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:52.829> ice<00:00:53.100> at<00:00:53.579> zero

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
but we didn't act the ice at zero

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:05.509 
but we didn't act the ice at zero
through<00:00:54.780> water<00:00:58.280> we<00:00:59.280> are<00:00:59.430> an<00:00:59.940> hour<00:01:00.329> late<00:01:04.519> that's

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
through water we are an hour late that's

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.399 
through water we are an hour late that's
why<00:01:05.820> I<00:01:07.250> bothered<00:01:08.250> you<00:01:08.280> i<00:01:08.400> would<00:01:09.299> resemble<00:01:12.409> once

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
why I bothered you i would resemble once

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.490 
why I bothered you i would resemble once
you<00:01:13.619> have<00:01:13.770> no<00:01:13.979> one<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> alive<00:01:14.850> if<00:01:15.330> I<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.750> job<00:01:16.049> 0

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
you have no one is alive if I a job 0

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.030 
you have no one is alive if I a job 0
for<00:01:17.159> hire<00:01:19.880> select<00:01:20.880> relate<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:22.259> have<00:01:22.860> a

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
for hire select relate so you have a

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.200 
for hire select relate so you have a
problem<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:24.840> that<00:01:25.400> indicates<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.850> your<00:01:27.000> ice

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
problem and that indicates to your ice

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.649 
problem and that indicates to your ice
and<00:01:27.509> water<00:01:27.659> both<00:01:28.590> threats<00:01:29.119> and<00:01:30.119> you<00:01:30.299> know<00:01:30.420> that

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
and water both threats and you know that

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.680 
and water both threats and you know that
the<00:01:30.750> final<00:01:31.110> consistency<00:01:33.079> no<00:01:34.079> calculation

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.790 

so<00:01:37.690> through<00:01:37.900> the<00:01:38.020> kitchen<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.470> wanna<00:01:38.680> make

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:38.800 
so through the kitchen you wanna make

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.040 
so through the kitchen you wanna make
sure<00:01:39.040> through<00:01:39.400> temperature<00:01:39.910> water<00:01:40.150> to<00:01:40.780> take

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
sure through temperature water to take

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.040 
sure through temperature water to take
some<00:01:41.320> water<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.400> add<00:01:42.730> analyze<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.660> certain

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
some water and add analyze and certain

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.160 
some water and add analyze and certain
civil<00:01:44.380> Isis<00:01:44.740> Melanie<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:46.210> then<00:01:46.600> even<00:01:46.840> without

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
civil Isis Melanie and then even without

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.020 
civil Isis Melanie and then even without
a<00:01:47.230> momentary<00:01:47.920> north<00:01:49.740> now<00:01:50.740> it<00:01:50.980> is<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.400> not<00:01:51.820> if

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:52.030 
a momentary north now it is just not if

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:53.940 
a momentary north now it is just not if
it's<00:01:52.180> just<00:01:52.420> as<00:01:52.570> a<00:01:52.660> break<00:01:52.900> that<00:01:53.170> could<00:01:53.440> be<00:01:53.590> zeros

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
it's just as a break that could be zeros

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
it's just as a break that could be zeros
in<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.190> lot<00:01:55.710> just<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.890> little<00:01:56.920> rise<00:01:57.400> and<00:01:57.730> if<00:01:57.820> you

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
in a lot just a little rise and if you

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.540 
in a lot just a little rise and if you
say<00:01:58.300> so<00:01:59.140> where<00:01:59.350> can<00:01:59.470> I<00:01:59.590> get<00:01:59.650> a<00:01:59.800> reaction<00:02:00.160> to<00:02:00.460> a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
say so where can I get a reaction to a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:14.550 
say so where can I get a reaction to a
decision<00:02:04.260> now<00:02:05.260> you<00:02:05.320> have<00:02:12.780> now<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.840> last<00:02:14.170> one

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
decision now you have now the last one

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:20.100 
decision now you have now the last one
by<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.010> time<00:02:15.460> I'd<00:02:15.700> like<00:02:15.730> to<00:02:15.910> look<00:02:16.240> that<00:02:16.450> is<00:02:19.110> one

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
by the time I'd like to look that is one

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.440 
by the time I'd like to look that is one
where<00:02:20.500> we're<00:02:20.620> going<00:02:20.830> to<00:02:20.950> heat<00:02:21.250> and<00:02:21.550> work<00:02:22.060> when

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
where we're going to heat and work when

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:30.990 
where we're going to heat and work when

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
here in this water this would be coming

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:54.160 
here in this water this would be coming

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
water gap at 100 degrees so I have to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:02.640 
water gap at 100 degrees so I have to
chop<00:02:54.410> don't<00:02:54.890> need<00:02:56.260> to<00:02:57.940> find<00:02:58.940> delta<00:02:59.780> T<00:03:00.400> for
