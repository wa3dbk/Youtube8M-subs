00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.529

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.390
 open the channel to all of you means 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:23.100
 that you can now send your videos 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.099
 when you like it and like it 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.660
 on the minecraft theme but then how to do it 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.849
 to video weapons and how to do it to 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
 have them accepted so what are i 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.279
 requirements 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.410
 then guys meanwhile the videos go 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.469
 sent to the email sanchez drake 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.690
 snail gmail.com that you find both in 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.670
 description and be now on the screen 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.649
 after which these videos what is that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.500
 they must have to be accepted 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.969
 first of all they must be at least 720p 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.160
 therefore minimum 720p and the maximum 1080p 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.110
 because however more than 1,080 none 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.870
 watch the videos or at least I think that 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.059
 no one does the second requirement is 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.980
 that these videos must be unique in the 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.000
 their kind in the sense that you can't 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.460
 make videos also on your channel 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.409
 it must necessarily be exclusive to the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.350
 my channel so if you make a tutorial of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.420
 in short, a structure of the red with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.920
 the red stone you have to do it only for the 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.570
 my channel you can't put this 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.210
 video from other parties because otherwise 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.729
 then there will be copyright issues 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.290
 so you have to be very careful the 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.420
 third requirement is to have the 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.520
 free copyright music so where is that 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.979
 you can find music that you are 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.619
 sure they are completely free 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.180
 you must have no copyright 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.100
 go to the two sites that puts you a 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.479
 description and if you don't feel like 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.829
 go where two sites look for 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 music because they are practically there 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.680
 all free and without copyright 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.140
 you can download my package 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.640
 youtuber you find now at the top a 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.770
 right of the screen in that package 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.380
 there will be a lot of things they have to 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.450
 what to do with youtube there are gods 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.799
 There are programs to record 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.960
 photoshop 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.390
 there are a lot of things but 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.759
 among those many things there are also the 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.590
 free copyright music then the music 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.539
 that you are sure you can use for 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.879
 therefore strengthens this the third requirement 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.910
 having free music is 

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.680
 completely 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:18.970
 copyright the fourth requirement however is 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.400
 very simple and the most obvious of all 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.990
 true what kind of video should be 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.390
 obviously video guys have to be 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:29.650
 only and exclusively of minecraft e 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.420
 they can be tutorials and in short things 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.790
 that have to do with curiosity and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.420
 strange things we say about minecraft then 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.980
 don't make me a gameplay don't make me one 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.470
 what already seen and reviewed but do me 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.690
 something interesting to do 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.250
 with the red stone or what to do 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.350
 with curiosities precisely on 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.090
 minecraft or even on a texture 

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:51.490
 important to pack these videos together 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.440
 to facts well that there is desire to do 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.020
 on your part and therefore there is the 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.280
 utmost commitment is another thing 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.690
 you can also send me 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.270
 structures for example if you have one 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:04.060
 structure ganza tv a castle 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:06.850
 beautiful made with many towers fig 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.490
 you can easily send me or 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:16.690
 you know for example of the you 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:19.780
 rebuilt the whole world in scale 1 a 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.730
 1 on minecraft a bit impossible however in 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.410
 1 year scale on minecraft perfect minus 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.720
 send and be sure that 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:28.420
 certainly if the video is done well 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.920
 will be accepted then guys there 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.690
