00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:18.029
 based on this french lucrÃ¨ce area 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.920
 what's the quattro the first hairstyle 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.869
 is a simplified version of the braid 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.849
 alsatian of the Snow Queen is 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.830
 a braid on the side a lot more 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.199
 quick and easy to make yourself 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.210
 the original version the second 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.910
 hairstyle is in very simple low bun 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.230
 to do 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:36.330
 the latest hairstyle is a bohemian look 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.120
 very trendy which their game so of course 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:40.410
 mid-long hair to start I 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.420
 I'll try my hair extensions 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.460
 Natural dagenham in real terms clips 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.500
 as usual I use a blond 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.750
 dark and a light blond to create a 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010
 effect of spontaneous villains 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.900
 we receive at home can either 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.950
 fully unravel and easy to this 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.900
 stop 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.690
 bring your hair back to one side 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.490
 a very low stop is like wick 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.050
 of hair parallel to your dream is 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.720
 divided into three parts 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.120
 place to the magic of left on the maj of the 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.780
 middle placed at the right mhd above 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:11.610
 chewy middle once again 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.500
 placed at the left maj on the image of the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.240
 middle is a game of waste from 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.580
 from the left side of your head to the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.160
 new maj of continuous circles 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.530
 trace add wicks alternately 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.100

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.110
 behind your braids 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.180
 we have to integrate all these horses into 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.510
 address before reaching the level of 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.510
 shoulders 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.739
 if you want now you can 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:31.910
 delicately pulled on the braid for 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:34.870
