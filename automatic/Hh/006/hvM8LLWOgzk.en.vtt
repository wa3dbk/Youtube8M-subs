00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
keys and then behind that as well you do

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.170 
keys and then behind that as well you do
have<00:00:53.020> additional<00:00:53.739> storage<00:00:54.010> as<00:00:54.430> well<00:00:54.790> just<00:00:55.000> for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
have additional storage as well just for

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.460 
have additional storage as well just for
those<00:00:55.300> bits<00:00:55.540> even<00:00:55.750> if<00:00:56.020> you've<00:00:56.140> got<00:00:56.290> like<00:00:56.410> a

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
those bits even if you've got like a

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:57.960 
those bits even if you've got like a
hydration<00:00:56.920> bladder<00:00:57.130> you<00:00:57.460> can<00:00:57.579> probably<00:00:57.730> slide

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:57.970 
hydration bladder you can probably slide

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.520 
hydration bladder you can probably slide
that<00:00:58.239> in<00:00:58.360> there<00:00:58.540> and<00:00:58.690> then<00:00:59.050> work<00:00:59.200> it<00:00:59.440> out

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
that in there and then work it out

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.620 
that in there and then work it out
coming<00:00:59.920> out<00:01:00.040> from<00:01:00.250> the<00:01:00.399> hose<00:01:00.579> kind<00:01:01.239> of<00:01:01.360> between

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
coming out from the hose kind of between

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:03.540 
coming out from the hose kind of between
the<00:01:02.050> you<00:01:02.620> know<00:01:02.739> between<00:01:02.890> the<00:01:03.070> zips<00:01:03.370> there

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
the you know between the zips there

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.219 
the you know between the zips there
let's<00:01:04.150> just<00:01:04.300> say<00:01:04.390> that's<00:01:04.540> pretty<00:01:04.809> much<00:01:04.989> what

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
let's just say that's pretty much what

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:07.410 
let's just say that's pretty much what
that's<00:01:05.379> designed<00:01:06.220> for<00:01:06.340> it's<00:01:06.700> mint<00:01:06.909> is<00:01:07.090> all

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
that's designed for it's mint is all

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.969 
that's designed for it's mint is all
about<00:01:07.720> keeping<00:01:08.110> it<00:01:08.350> nice<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.800> lightweight

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
about keeping it nice and lightweight

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.030 
about keeping it nice and lightweight
but<00:01:09.610> functional<00:01:10.210> as<00:01:10.360> one<00:01:10.870> paddling<00:01:11.650> system

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
but functional as one paddling system

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.800 
but functional as one paddling system
itself<00:01:12.370> you<00:01:12.490> get<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.729> air<00:01:12.880> vent<00:01:13.210> section<00:01:13.720> on

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
itself you get the air vent section on

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.000 
itself you get the air vent section on
the<00:01:13.900> back<00:01:14.020> there<00:01:14.200> so<00:01:14.350> there's<00:01:14.500> mid<00:01:14.710> section

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 
the back there so there's mid section

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.010 
the back there so there's mid section
well<00:01:15.670> you'll<00:01:15.820> notice<00:01:15.970> is<00:01:16.299> obviously<00:01:16.600> slightly

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
well you'll notice is obviously slightly

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.450 
well you'll notice is obviously slightly
in<00:01:17.140> water<00:01:17.380> it's<00:01:17.620> going<00:01:17.710> to<00:01:17.799> enable<00:01:17.920> cool<00:01:18.280> air

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
in water it's going to enable cool air

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.770 
in water it's going to enable cool air
to<00:01:18.610> run<00:01:18.850> through<00:01:19.060> your<00:01:19.210> back<00:01:19.330> but<00:01:19.479> then<00:01:19.600> also

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
to run through your back but then also

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.180 
to run through your back but then also
that's<00:01:20.049> going<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.260> allow<00:01:20.470> the<00:01:20.530> moisture<00:01:20.680> to

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
that's going to allow the moisture to

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.070 
that's going to allow the moisture to
escape<00:01:21.640> from<00:01:22.090> your<00:01:22.299> back<00:01:22.570> as<00:01:22.810> well

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
escape from your back as well

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.660 
escape from your back as well
the<00:01:23.380> padding<00:01:23.680> themselves<00:01:24.190> does<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.520> does

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
the padding themselves does that does

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.580 
the padding themselves does that does
have<00:01:24.820> like<00:01:25.000> a<00:01:25.030> honeycomb<00:01:25.390> section<00:01:26.020> to<00:01:26.170> it<00:01:26.260> so

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
have like a honeycomb section to it so

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.200 
have like a honeycomb section to it so
that's<00:01:26.740> going<00:01:26.950> to<00:01:27.100> label<00:01:27.280> the<00:01:27.549> breathability

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 
that's going to label the breathability

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.960 
that's going to label the breathability
as<00:01:28.690> well<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.290> bag<00:01:29.440> as<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.799> say<00:01:30.070> it<00:01:30.310> really

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
as well of the bag as I say it really

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.730 
as well of the bag as I say it really
does<00:01:31.119> have<00:01:31.299> all<00:01:31.540> the<00:01:31.659> runners<00:01:31.780> in<00:01:32.110> mind<00:01:32.500> there

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
does have all the runners in mind there

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.800
