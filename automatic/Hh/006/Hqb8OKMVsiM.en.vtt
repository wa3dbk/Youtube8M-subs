00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.860 
you can change that right there so I'm
just<00:02:19.819> gonna<00:02:19.939> have<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.390> blank<00:02:21.310> its<00:02:22.310> save<00:02:22.870> and

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
just gonna have it blank its save and

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.330 
just gonna have it blank its save and
then<00:02:24.019> it<00:02:24.170> just<00:02:24.349> gets<00:02:24.620> rid<00:02:24.799> of<00:02:24.860> it<00:02:25.010> completely

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
then it just gets rid of it completely

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.559 
then it just gets rid of it completely
so<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.180> can<00:02:26.299> do<00:02:26.420> multiple<00:02:26.569> printers<00:02:27.349> and

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
so you can do multiple printers and

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:31.479 
so you can do multiple printers and
though<00:02:29.569> it'll<00:02:29.930> show<00:02:30.230> up<00:02:30.409> here<00:02:30.739> on<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.250> list

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
though it'll show up here on the list

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:35.199 
though it'll show up here on the list
and<00:02:32.829> it's<00:02:33.829> actually<00:02:34.159> all<00:02:34.310> you<00:02:34.489> need<00:02:34.640> to<00:02:34.760> do<00:02:34.940> for

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
and it's actually all you need to do for

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:37.539 
and it's actually all you need to do for
air<00:02:35.329> for<00:02:35.569> an<00:02:35.690> activator<00:02:36.110> but<00:02:36.379> your<00:02:37.010> computer

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
air for an activator but your computer

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:43.360 
air for an activator but your computer
needs<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:38.150> be<00:02:38.329> on<00:02:39.519> to<00:02:40.519> use<00:02:41.239> air<00:02:41.540> print<00:02:42.370> because

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
needs to be on to use air print because

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.160 
needs to be on to use air print because
it<00:02:43.400> uses<00:02:43.849> the<00:02:44.030> computer<00:02:44.209> actually<00:02:44.930> what<00:02:45.049> it

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
it uses the computer actually what it

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.759 
it uses the computer actually what it
does<00:02:45.379> is<00:02:46.329> using<00:02:47.329> AirPrint<00:02:47.720> it<00:02:47.959> actually<00:02:48.290> sends

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 
does is using AirPrint it actually sends

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.680 
does is using AirPrint it actually sends
the<00:02:49.340> thing<00:02:49.760> that<00:02:49.909> you<00:02:49.970> want<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.209> print<00:02:50.390> to<00:02:50.569> the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
the thing that you want to print to the

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.970 
the thing that you want to print to the
computer<00:02:51.200> then<00:02:51.409> it<00:02:51.440> sends<00:02:51.829> it<00:02:52.040> to<00:02:52.220> the<00:02:52.510> printer

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
computer then it sends it to the printer

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.300 
computer then it sends it to the printer
so<00:02:54.980> it's<00:02:55.370> not<00:02:56.409> instead<00:02:57.409> of<00:02:57.560> needing<00:02:57.920> to<00:02:58.010> buy<00:02:58.129> an

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
so it's not instead of needing to buy an

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.119 
so it's not instead of needing to buy an
air<00:02:58.459> print<00:02:58.819> printer<00:02:59.690> it<00:03:00.409> goes<00:03:00.739> through<00:03:01.040> the

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
air print printer it goes through the

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.750 
air print printer it goes through the
computer<00:03:01.579> so<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.879> computer<00:03:02.150> needs<00:03:03.019> to<00:03:03.109> be<00:03:03.200> on

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
computer so the computer needs to be on

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.990 
computer so the computer needs to be on
but<00:03:05.440> you<00:03:06.440> don't<00:03:06.650> need<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.859> do<00:03:07.340> anything<00:03:07.609> every

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
but you don't need to do anything every

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.580 
but you don't need to do anything every
time<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.299> turn<00:03:08.480> it<00:03:08.569> on<00:03:08.659> it<00:03:08.900> should<00:03:09.079> work<00:03:09.230> every

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
time you turn it on it should work every

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.879 
time you turn it on it should work every
time<00:03:09.769> that<00:03:10.069> you<00:03:10.220> turn<00:03:11.090> on<00:03:11.269> the<00:03:11.389> computer<00:03:11.889> and

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:12.889 
time that you turn on the computer and

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.460 
time that you turn on the computer and
that's<00:03:13.069> it<00:03:13.280> it's<00:03:13.940> pretty<00:03:14.150> simple<00:03:14.239> to<00:03:14.599> nimble

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
that's it it's pretty simple to nimble

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.849 
that's it it's pretty simple to nimble
air<00:03:15.620> print<00:03:15.889> and<00:03:16.959> if<00:03:17.959> you<00:03:18.049> have<00:03:18.169> any<00:03:18.319> questions

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:18.859

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:21.460
