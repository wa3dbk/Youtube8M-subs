 Yes i 'm going to get this 7 update before i start 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.930
 If you've seen a snapshot, you may know, but if you forget it, try it once more 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:21.640
 Well recommended 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:26.640
 Well this time there are a lot of updates on Redstone, but let's go 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.420
 Yes, this red stone comparator is new 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.620
 Something like a red stone repeater has been added 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.040
 I don't know much about this , but fire bra knows about this 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:42.240
 Than there 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:46.110
 You want to know that you are familiar who is recommended to see the video of the pie oil of 

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:49.970
 I don't know much about Red Stone I guess next 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.230
 Yes This is a block that say dropper 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:57.160
 And this is as the name 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:59.700
 Yes also put course another all PECO was Do Well opponent in this 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.700
 Then 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.300
 It came more and more items like this 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:15.200
 I will go here after I enter here 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.100
 Well Oh At the same I might have not liked Well, but this is 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.440
 It was not a pity 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.340
 I'm sorry 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.340
 It was a hopper 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:27.860
 I'm sorry Seriously Day 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.940
 It 's okay to repeat this like this 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:32.350
 Akuse 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.530
 It is all right even if we repeat 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.710
 Again, from this official office Ropper 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:42.620
 I went to this hopper from the hopper that I mistaken for the island 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.730
 I will go to this chest 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.720
 This is no matter how you collect hoppers 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.470
 Yes next is this 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.720
 Well it is I Well mistake while ago This is a dropper 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.020
 Heidi's 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.760
 Ah this is a dispenser car Akhatta Europe 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:06.200
 Yes the dropper has become Nico Nico Mark but this face is 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.920
 The dispenser beats the ear when I let it go inside 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.569
 Dropper 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.660
 It is such a feeling to yes 2 to drop 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:18.070
 It is pretty good 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:23.830
 And now I have not prepared here, but the dispenser has also changed 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:27.220
 For example, if this beer is put, it will grow in a moment if there is grass here 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:31.450
 This dispenser sea Once in the armor 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:36.280
 If you stand here I will be automatically attached here 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:38.920
 Yes Yes This is'm sad up Sorcerer but 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:44.190
 How is this 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:49.290
 It is not possible to grow it with one Bonn look 12 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.700
 I also need 3 pieces Bonville I don't like this plate too much 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.390
 Thats also Well 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.390
 Maa Maa Maa 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:02.650
 It's sad I guess this may look like a normal chest 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:07.390
 Red around 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.460
 There are some things but this is a trap and a chest and it is red when opened 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:14.270
 And the trajectory of the stone came out in Pune 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:18.050
 Once the well is said to Tien here Hana For example, you dance can be used to trap 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.680
 Because it is something I wonder What What open 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.430
 eh 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:27.300
 You can also pass a bird with a feeling 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:31.980
 Jazz position yes this may seem to be a pressure plate 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.120
 It does not make sense to get on why this is a depeche applet to go to 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:37.960
 In the weight of the item 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:44.860
 It will be decided whether the dong will be strong 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:47.170
 Here a I'd come out strongly live video in a little lighter items here are full of items 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.730
 It will not be so strong without putting 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.730
 I see this difference a little later 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:04:01.269
 Yes here is a little strong orbit Next 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:04.120
 Yes normal like love species but this is I block by saying Red Sutonbu lock 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:10.350
 I'm out of redstone orbit 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:14.420
 And of course, this one can be moved at the piston, so if you like map making surely 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:18.829
 I think now that I think something new Daihatsu eyes 

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:21.310
 Yes I thought it was quite interesting but this is day light 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:27.530
 sensor you want in a guy 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:32.990
 Put out a trajectory in the wind that say this is the time when the morning you are well out of the corresponding 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:34.300
 Well this doesn't matter Let's do it this way I'll put an orbit, but at night 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:36.599
 Person 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.599
 Yes 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.080
 Don't put out The lung airway has disappeared though 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.390
 U 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:52.380
 When Well this is yes to something like 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:55.300
 Something like a reverse weapon This will disappear at night, but like this , Red Stone block 

00:04:52.380 --> 00:05:00.520
 If you set the middle east feel 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:03.150
 It will be here can do something automatic Denki look like stick So, for example, 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:07.500
 It will disappear in the morning 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:12.120
 When night comes this can be like this 

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:13.170
 Now it's 4 Yes next I can't do this unless it's a cree creative 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:17.760
 but 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:21.889
 Like this , put the creamer 's spawn egg and so on to the anvil 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:25.020
 You can change the name, for example, and to Bob edge 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:28.639
 Barber with a creeper called Bob 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.699
 This is a round tee clipper and this is 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.800
 Is Ender Man say 8 Tanaka udon comes out 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:37.630
 Ah I have a chance to make some noise at the chance , but the enderman star or udon bar 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.340
 Mark 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.280
 ok 's 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.970
 Do you want to continue 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.990
 Yes this is tnt no line ah ah minecraft 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.590

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.740

00:05:55.740 --> 00:06:07.230
 Here Oh Tteyuu activator because this is a little different from that seen 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:11.180
 Once through here it this tnt mine cart is a view I'd rail 

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:11.180
 Let's go through a little bit of explosion 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.009
 Then yes 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:19.259
 woke up 

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:19.259
 I heard that arm now 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.230
 So much 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.650
 Yes Is this a cool updater mistake ? 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:34.389
 New item called quartz is added to the Nether 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:38.440
 If you collect these coats like this, it's a cool thing with a quartz block but Greek 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:42.720
 You can make a block that looks like a building . Let's go to the mountain. 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:48.450
 There was this Nether immediately 

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:49.140

 There are a lot of earth on the ceiling here 13 meals 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:08.890
 It is dangerous but quite many, and there was a ruin of one Nether by accident . 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.890
 I'm lucky 

00:07:10.590 --> 00:07:20.700
 Well then yes this is all of this 1.5 Redstone update 

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:25.720
