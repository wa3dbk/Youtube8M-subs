tracks with with DJ and live in Ableton
you<00:00:58.170> could<00:00:58.289> probably<00:00:58.500> use<00:00:58.770> as<00:00:58.920> many<00:00:59.100> tracks<00:00:59.370> as

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
you could probably use as many tracks as

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.209 
you could probably use as many tracks as
you<00:00:59.640> like<00:00:59.879> but<00:01:00.750> you're<00:01:01.260> pretty<00:01:01.590> much<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:02.070> to

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
you like but you're pretty much going to

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.690 
you like but you're pretty much going to
have<00:01:02.820> two<00:01:03.149> tracks<00:01:03.480> as<00:01:03.809> your<00:01:04.320> main<00:01:04.500> setup<00:01:05.010> you

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
have two tracks as your main setup you

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.219 
have two tracks as your main setup you
know<00:01:05.790> just<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.090> having<00:01:06.360> two<00:01:06.540> turntables<00:01:06.780> or

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
know just like having two turntables or

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.010 
know just like having two turntables or
whatever<00:01:07.760> so<00:01:08.760> we're<00:01:09.150> setting<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.600> up<00:01:09.780> in

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
whatever so we're setting this up in

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.120 
whatever so we're setting this up in
audio<00:01:10.350> one<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.740> audio<00:01:10.979> two<00:01:11.220> and<00:01:11.790> I've<00:01:12.540> dragged

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
audio one and audio two and I've dragged

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.120 
audio one and audio two and I've dragged
two<00:01:14.130> separate<00:01:14.520> tracks<00:01:14.760> in<00:01:15.890> one<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.009> each

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
two separate tracks in one in each

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.749 
two separate tracks in one in each
window<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:18.650> basically<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.340> first<00:01:20.580> thing

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
window and basically the first thing

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.999 
window and basically the first thing
that<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:21.000> want<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.330> figure<00:01:22.020> out<00:01:22.140> how<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.290> do<00:01:22.530> is

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
that you want to figure out how to do is

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.179 
that you want to figure out how to do is
how<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:23.970> cue<00:01:24.299> your<00:01:24.479> tracks<00:01:24.750> so<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.320> for

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
how to cue your tracks so I can for

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.819 
how to cue your tracks so I can for
example<00:01:26.610> listen<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.119> this<00:01:27.750> track<00:01:28.020> here<00:01:28.439> while

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
example listen to this track here while

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.069 
example listen to this track here while
this<00:01:29.040> one's<00:01:29.250> playing<00:01:31.340> in<00:01:32.340> order<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:33.000> queue<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
this one's playing in order to queue a

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.550 
this one's playing in order to queue a
track<00:01:34.710> you<00:01:35.369> are<00:01:35.640> going<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.600> need<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.990> multiple

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
track you are going to need a multiple

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.310 
track you are going to need a multiple
output<00:01:38.100> sound<00:01:38.790> card<00:01:39.180> something<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.079> more

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
output sound card something with more

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.569 
output sound card something with more
than<00:01:40.500> just<00:01:40.560> stereo<00:01:41.040> out<00:01:43.280> otherwise<00:01:44.280> it's<00:01:44.520> just

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
than just stereo out otherwise it's just

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.350 
than just stereo out otherwise it's just
not<00:01:44.880> going<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.530> it's<00:01:46.530> not<00:01:46.649> going<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.920> work<00:01:47.360> so

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
not going to it's not going to work so

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.580 
not going to it's not going to work so
in<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.810> case<00:01:49.170> I<00:01:49.590> don't<00:01:50.579> have<00:01:51.200> any<00:01:52.200> more<00:01:52.409> than

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
in this case I don't have any more than

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.920 
in this case I don't have any more than
stereo<00:01:52.890> outputs<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.490> even<00:01:53.670> if<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.880> did<00:01:54.180> you

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
stereo outputs and even if I did you

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.350 
stereo outputs and even if I did you
wouldn't<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.229> able<00:01:55.350> to<00:01:55.500> hear<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.920> cue<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:57.149> this

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
wouldn't be able to hear the cue in this

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.130 
wouldn't be able to hear the cue in this
tutorial<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.759> what<00:01:59.759> I'm<00:01:59.880> doing<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.420> I'm<00:02:01.079> going

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
tutorial so what I'm doing is I'm going

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.350 
tutorial so what I'm doing is I'm going
to<00:02:01.920> set<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.759> main<00:02:03.799> output<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:05.759> the<00:02:06.149> left

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
to set the main output to the left

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.419 
to set the main output to the left
speaker<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.020> then<00:02:07.530> I'm<00:02:07.619> gonna<00:02:07.740> set<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.160> Q

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
speaker and then I'm gonna set the Q

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.520 
speaker and then I'm gonna set the Q
output<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.270> right<00:02:09.450> speaker<00:02:09.899> so<00:02:10.200> basically

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
output to the right speaker so basically

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.350 
output to the right speaker so basically
you<00:02:10.739> can<00:02:10.890> kind<00:02:11.520> of<00:02:11.580> see<00:02:11.819> what<00:02:12.030> they're<00:02:12.180> both

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
you can kind of see what they're both

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.900 
you can kind of see what they're both
doing

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
doing

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:15.790 
doing
like<00:02:14.180> I<00:02:14.210> said<00:02:14.450> before<00:02:14.630> this<00:02:14.990> is<00:02:15.170> just<00:02:15.440> for<00:02:15.710> the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
like I said before this is just for the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.730 
like I said before this is just for the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
more than two outputs so let's go ahead

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.850 
more than two outputs so let's go ahead
and<00:02:21.740> start<00:02:23.290> first<00:02:24.290> thing<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:24.560> you're<00:02:24.680> going

section<00:02:30.830> here<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.580> this<00:02:32.330> is<00:02:32.480> where<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.900> would

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
section here and this is where you would

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.020 
section here and this is where you would
find<00:02:33.080> all<00:02:33.590> your<00:02:33.740> multiple<00:02:34.130> out<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.550> let's<00:02:34.880> say

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
you had six or eight outputs you could

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.700 
you had six or eight outputs you could
come<00:02:38.180> over<00:02:38.270> here<00:02:38.420> and<00:02:38.630> choose<00:02:38.870> output<00:02:39.230> three

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
and four for your cue and then your main

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.900 
and four for your cue and then your main
output<00:02:42.050> would<00:02:42.170> be<00:02:42.230> one<00:02:42.500> and<00:02:42.650> two<00:02:42.770> in<00:02:43.340> this<00:02:43.670> case

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910 
output would be one and two in this case

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.420 
output would be one and two in this case
I'm<00:02:44.150> gonna<00:02:44.300> choose<00:02:44.870> output<00:02:45.350> two<00:02:45.920> which<00:02:46.280> is

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430 
I'm gonna choose output two which is

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.330 
I'm gonna choose output two which is
going<00:02:46.490> to<00:02:46.610> be<00:02:46.730> your<00:02:46.880> right<00:02:46.970> speaker<00:02:47.450> and<00:02:48.340> then

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
output one and then on both of my tracks

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.610 
output one and then on both of my tracks
I'm<00:02:58.400> gonna<00:02:58.670> go<00:02:58.820> ahead<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.110> assign<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.320> to

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
I'm gonna go ahead and assign this to

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.940 
I'm gonna go ahead and assign this to

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
one and assign this to one as well just

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.350 
one and assign this to one as well just
like<00:03:04.100> so<00:03:05.230> now<00:03:06.250> normally<00:03:07.250> when<00:03:07.550> you<00:03:07.760> set<00:03:08.150> it<00:03:08.180> up

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
like so now normally when you set it up

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.900 
like so now normally when you set it up
properly<00:03:08.560> these<00:03:09.560> outputs<00:03:09.980> would<00:03:10.100> be<00:03:10.250> one<00:03:10.760> and

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
properly these outputs would be one and

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.760 
properly these outputs would be one and
two<00:03:11.060> and<00:03:11.420> your<00:03:11.900> cue<00:03:12.110> would<00:03:12.200> be<00:03:12.320> set<00:03:12.530> up<00:03:12.650> to

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
two and your cue would be set up to

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.950 
two and your cue would be set up to
three<00:03:13.010> and<00:03:13.100> four<00:03:13.340> or<00:03:13.670> whatever

what you'll notice now is since I've set

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.070 
what you'll notice now is since I've set
this<00:03:17.900> cue<00:03:18.290> to<00:03:18.680> its<00:03:19.190> own<00:03:19.370> output<00:03:19.870> this<00:03:20.870> has

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:21.080 
this cue to its own output this has

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.520 
this cue to its own output this has
changed<00:03:21.500> here<00:03:21.830> to<00:03:22.370> Q<00:03:22.820> and<00:03:23.080> this<00:03:24.080> right<00:03:24.320> here

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:24.530 
changed here to Q and this right here

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.060 
changed here to Q and this right here
now<00:03:24.800> becomes<00:03:25.220> your<00:03:25.850> headphone<00:03:26.270> volume<00:03:26.440> so<00:03:27.440> if

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.060 

just<00:04:10.000> like<00:04:10.150> so<00:04:14.610> so<00:04:15.610> let's<00:04:15.819> say<00:04:16.030> this<00:04:16.829> this<00:04:17.829> song

speaker so I'll turn off the cue and you
got<00:04:43.660> both<00:04:43.840> songs<00:04:44.169> playing<00:04:44.530> so<00:04:45.160> let<00:04:45.280> me<00:04:45.340> stop

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
got both songs playing so let me stop

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.879 
got both songs playing so let me stop
this<00:04:45.729> for<00:04:45.910> a<00:04:46.000> second<00:04:49.680> because<00:04:50.680> that's

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
this for a second because that's

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.070 
this for a second because that's
essentially<00:04:51.520> how<00:04:52.150> it<00:04:52.180> works<00:04:52.479> with<00:04:52.690> the<00:04:52.750> volume

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
essentially how it works with the volume

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.150 
essentially how it works with the volume
now<00:04:53.380> you<00:04:54.220> could<00:04:54.340> also<00:04:54.490> work<00:04:54.850> with<00:04:56.130> with<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
now you could also work with with the

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.850 
now you could also work with with the
cross<00:04:57.400> fader<00:04:57.669> and<00:04:58.000> in<00:04:58.780> that<00:04:58.930> case<00:04:59.200> you<00:04:59.770> would

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
cross fader and in that case you would

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:01.140 
cross fader and in that case you would
just<00:05:00.039> go<00:05:00.160> ahead<00:05:00.250> and<00:05:00.430> leave<00:05:00.580> both<00:05:00.880> of<00:05:01.060> your

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150 
just go ahead and leave both of your

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:04.589 
just go ahead and leave both of your
volumes<00:05:01.510> up<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.340> you<00:05:03.340> would<00:05:03.460> assign<00:05:03.789> here's

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
volumes up and you would assign here's

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.150 
volumes up and you would assign here's
your<00:05:04.780> cross<00:05:04.900> waiter<00:05:05.260> over<00:05:05.410> here<00:05:05.530> follow<00:05:05.950> my

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:06.160 
your cross waiter over here follow my

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.490 
your cross waiter over here follow my
arrow<00:05:06.419> down<00:05:07.419> here<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.810> the<00:05:07.990> actual<00:05:08.320> cross

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:08.500 
arrow down here is the actual cross

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.400 
arrow down here is the actual cross
fader<00:05:09.539> just<00:05:10.539> all<00:05:10.750> the<00:05:10.840> way<00:05:10.930> to<00:05:10.990> the<00:05:11.110> left<00:05:11.200> and

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
fader just all the way to the left and

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.450 
fader just all the way to the left and
right<00:05:11.530> now<00:05:12.539> the<00:05:13.539> right<00:05:13.750> side<00:05:14.080> is<00:05:14.410> going<00:05:15.160> to

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
right now the right side is going to

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:19.529 
right now the right side is going to
represent<00:05:15.760> a<00:05:16.320> so<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.880> excuse<00:05:18.880> me<00:05:19.000> the<00:05:19.120> left<00:05:19.300> side

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
represent a so I excuse me the left side

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.589 
represent a so I excuse me the left side
is<00:05:19.720> going<00:05:19.900> to<00:05:19.990> represent<00:05:20.169> a<00:05:20.669> so<00:05:21.669> you<00:05:22.360> want<00:05:22.539> to

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:22.599 
is going to represent a so you want to

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:26.390 
is going to represent a so you want to
put<00:05:22.750> your<00:05:22.900> your<00:05:23.349> first<00:05:23.590> audio<00:05:23.950> track<00:05:24.250> on<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.840> and

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
put your your first audio track on a and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.450 
put your your first audio track on a and
your<00:05:27.400> second<00:05:28.060> audio<00:05:28.330> track<00:05:28.630> on<00:05:28.870> be<00:05:30.120> that<00:05:31.120> way

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
your second audio track on be that way

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:36.720 
your second audio track on be that way
if<00:05:33.460> I<00:05:33.580> go<00:05:33.729> ahead<00:05:33.820> and<00:05:33.940> play<00:05:34.120> both<00:05:34.389> of<00:05:34.419> them

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:36.730 
if I go ahead and play both of them

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:39.780 

right<00:05:37.630> now<00:05:37.780> I'm<00:05:37.960> hearing<00:05:38.170> audio<00:05:38.560> one<00:05:38.830> because

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:39.790 
right now I'm hearing audio one because

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:42.360 
right now I'm hearing audio one because
I<00:05:40.030> got<00:05:40.870> my<00:05:40.990> cross<00:05:41.200> fader<00:05:41.440> set<00:05:41.680> over<00:05:41.830> here<00:05:41.860> and

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:42.370 
I got my cross fader set over here and

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:43.660 
I got my cross fader set over here and
then<00:05:42.790> as<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:43.060> blend

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:43.670 
then as I blend

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:53.720 
then as I blend
[Music]

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:53.730 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:55.770 

you'll<00:05:54.730> hear<00:05:54.880> the<00:05:55.000> other<00:05:55.120> tracks<00:05:55.390> starting<00:05:55.690> to

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:55.780 
you'll hear the other tracks starting to

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.860 
you'll hear the other tracks starting to
come<00:05:55.900> in<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:57.270> now<00:05:58.270> it's<00:05:58.450> starting<00:05:58.690> to<00:05:58.750> take

00:05:58.860 --> 00:05:58.870 
come in and now it's starting to take

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:08.670 
come in and now it's starting to take
over<00:06:03.840> just<00:06:04.840> like<00:06:05.020> so<00:06:07.200> so<00:06:08.200> let<00:06:08.350> me<00:06:08.410> go<00:06:08.530> ahead<00:06:08.590> and

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
over just like so so let me go ahead and

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.580 
over just like so so let me go ahead and
stop<00:06:08.920> that<00:06:09.780> and<00:06:10.780> what<00:06:11.200> you're<00:06:11.290> going<00:06:11.380> to<00:06:11.440> want

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
stop that and what you're going to want

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
stop that and what you're going to want
to<00:06:11.710> do<00:06:11.800> you're<00:06:11.950> not<00:06:12.070> going<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.310> want<00:06:12.430> to<00:06:12.490> use

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:12.610 
to do you're not going to want to use

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:14.490 
to do you're not going to want to use
the<00:06:12.760> cross<00:06:12.940> fader<00:06:13.180> with<00:06:13.360> your<00:06:13.540> mouse<00:06:13.690> you

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
the cross fader with your mouse you

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:17.730 
the cross fader with your mouse you
would<00:06:14.590> go<00:06:14.680> ahead<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:14.980> assign<00:06:15.400> that<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.870> one<00:06:17.650> of

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
would go ahead and assign that to one of

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.790 
would go ahead and assign that to one of
the<00:06:17.830> knobs<00:06:18.010> on<00:06:18.370> your<00:06:18.970> controller<00:06:19.960> would<00:06:20.380> be

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:20.800 
the knobs on your controller would be

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.890 
the knobs on your controller would be
the<00:06:20.920> best<00:06:21.100> approach<00:06:21.280> to<00:06:21.460> use<00:06:21.850> and<00:06:22.150> you<00:06:22.780> would

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:22.900 
the best approach to use and you would

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:26.460 
the best approach to use and you would
just<00:06:23.080> simply<00:06:23.230> hit<00:06:23.620> MIDI<00:06:24.070> and<00:06:25.350> grab<00:06:26.350> that

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:26.470 
just simply hit MIDI and grab that

00:06:26.470 --> 00:06:28.470 
just simply hit MIDI and grab that
controller<00:06:26.950> and<00:06:27.250> then<00:06:27.340> twist<00:06:27.910> the<00:06:28.090> knob<00:06:28.210> that

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:28.480 
controller and then twist the knob that

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:31.410 
controller and then twist the knob that
you<00:06:28.570> want<00:06:28.780> to<00:06:28.990> control<00:06:29.320> it<00:06:29.880> turn<00:06:30.880> it<00:06:31.000> off

00:06:31.410 --> 00:06:31.420 
you want to control it turn it off

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:35.160 
you want to control it turn it off
and<00:06:31.510> now<00:06:31.960> when<00:06:32.140> I<00:06:32.170> twist<00:06:32.470> that<00:06:32.680> knob<00:06:33.250> I<00:06:34.170> got

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:35.170 
and now when I twist that knob I got

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:37.380 
and now when I twist that knob I got
cement<00:06:35.500> a<00:06:35.650> smooth<00:06:36.010> transition<00:06:36.520> I'll<00:06:37.210> get<00:06:37.360> a

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
cement a smooth transition I'll get a

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.650 
cement a smooth transition I'll get a
little<00:06:37.540> bit<00:06:37.660> more<00:06:37.870> into<00:06:38.080> MIDI<00:06:38.230> setup<00:06:38.890> on

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.660 
little bit more into MIDI setup on

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:42.570 
little bit more into MIDI setup on
another<00:06:40.660> tutorial<00:06:41.050> I<00:06:41.380> think<00:06:42.280> this<00:06:42.400> is<00:06:42.490> going

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:42.580 
another tutorial I think this is going

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.420 
another tutorial I think this is going
to<00:06:42.670> be<00:06:42.760> a<00:06:42.790> four<00:06:43.000> part<00:06:43.180> tutorial<00:06:44.430> but

00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:45.430 
to be a four part tutorial but

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.850 
to be a four part tutorial but
essentially<00:06:45.850> this<00:06:46.030> is<00:06:46.390> the<00:06:46.840> basic<00:06:47.410> way<00:06:47.560> that

00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:47.860 
essentially this is the basic way that

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.320 
essentially this is the basic way that
you<00:06:48.820> set<00:06:49.060> up<00:06:49.180> for<00:06:49.210> cueing<00:06:49.870> and<00:06:50.490> and<00:06:51.490> set<00:06:52.240> up

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
you set up for cueing and and set up

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:54.750 
you set up for cueing and and set up
your<00:06:52.360> cross<00:06:52.660> fader<00:06:53.160> you<00:06:54.160> don't<00:06:54.310> just<00:06:54.520> have<00:06:54.670> to

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:54.760 
your cross fader you don't just have to

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.450 
your cross fader you don't just have to
assign<00:06:55.060> one<00:06:55.360> track<00:06:55.690> to<00:06:55.960> a<00:06:55.990> and<00:06:56.620> one<00:06:56.800> track<00:06:57.100> to<00:06:57.280> B

00:06:57.450 --> 00:06:57.460 
assign one track to a and one track to B

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.130 
assign one track to a and one track to B
you<00:06:58.060> could<00:06:58.150> have<00:06:58.270> as<00:06:58.420> many<00:06:58.540> tracks<00:06:58.840> as<00:06:59.020> you

00:06:59.130 --> 00:06:59.140 
you could have as many tracks as you

00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.670 
you could have as many tracks as you
want<00:06:59.410> essentially<00:07:00.130> but<00:07:00.510> I'm<00:07:01.510> trying<00:07:01.900> to<00:07:02.050> set

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:02.680 
want essentially but I'm trying to set

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:05.700 
want essentially but I'm trying to set
you<00:07:02.800> up<00:07:02.830> for<00:07:02.980> the<00:07:03.730> easiest<00:07:04.090> DJ<00:07:04.510> approach<00:07:04.870> and

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:05.710 
you up for the easiest DJ approach and
