00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
charge because of this I recommend

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.910 
charge because of this I recommend
waiting<00:01:15.540> before<00:01:15.689> you<00:01:15.990> enter<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.409> soul<00:01:16.650> Khan

waiting before you enter the soul Khan

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.969 
waiting before you enter the soul Khan
or<00:01:17.189> at<00:01:17.520> least<00:01:17.700> saving<00:01:18.119> before<00:01:18.450> you<00:01:18.570> enter

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
or at least saving before you enter

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:20.929 
or at least saving before you enter
unfortunately<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> only<00:01:20.340> other<00:01:20.610> way<00:01:20.790> of

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
unfortunately the only other way of

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.969 
unfortunately the only other way of
obtaining<00:01:21.090> dragon<00:01:21.780> bone<00:01:21.930> weapons<00:01:22.380> reliably

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
obtaining dragon bone weapons reliably

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.190 
obtaining dragon bone weapons reliably
is<00:01:23.310> by<00:01:23.490> smithing<00:01:24.000> them<00:01:24.180> because<00:01:24.659> they<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:24.869> not

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
is by smithing them because they do not

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.109 
is by smithing them because they do not
appear<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.530> containers<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.400> chests<00:01:26.970> I

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
appear in containers like chests I

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.660 
appear in containers like chests I
personally<00:01:27.990> think<00:01:28.200> this<00:01:28.409> is<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> real<00:01:28.829> pity<00:01:29.100> on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
personally think this is a real pity on

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.700 
personally think this is a real pity on
