00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
with a dry and wet knob you get a Mane

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.469 
with a dry and wet knob you get a Mane
out<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.340> basically<00:01:50.340> I<00:01:50.430> mean<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.939> way<00:01:51.299> that

pretty<00:03:45.150> spectacular<00:03:45.590> Mike<00:03:46.590> one<00:03:46.920> goes<00:03:47.490> into

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
pretty spectacular Mike one goes into

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.930 
pretty spectacular Mike one goes into
the<00:03:48.420> mic<00:03:48.990> one<00:03:49.200> input<00:03:49.740> of<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.280> rain'<00:03:50.459> product

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
the mic one input of the rain' product

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.720 
the mic one input of the rain' product
and<00:03:51.240> just<00:03:52.080> look<00:03:52.230> at<00:03:52.380> channel<00:03:53.280> one<00:03:53.310> and<00:03:53.459> you'll

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
and just look at channel one and you'll

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:55.910 
and just look at channel one and you'll
see<00:03:53.880> there's<00:03:54.060> a<00:03:54.120> balanced<00:03:54.690> quarter<00:03:55.440> inch<00:03:55.620> and

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
see there's a balanced quarter inch and

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.510 
see there's a balanced quarter inch and
a<00:03:56.790> balanced<00:03:57.209> XLR<00:03:57.600> input<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:59.220> can<00:03:59.400> be

00:03:59.510 --> 00:03:59.520 
a balanced XLR input that can be

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.570 
a balanced XLR input that can be
assigned<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.940> line<00:04:00.390> or<00:04:00.750> mic<00:04:01.170> level<00:04:01.590> there's

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:02.580 
assigned to line or mic level there's

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:04.370 
assigned to line or mic level there's
actually<00:04:03.150> a<00:04:03.180> gain<00:04:03.720> on<00:04:03.750> each<00:04:04.170> and<00:04:04.320> every

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
actually a gain on each and every

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.740 
actually a gain on each and every
channel<00:04:04.830> so<00:04:05.760> not<00:04:05.940> only<00:04:06.060> is<00:04:06.209> there<00:04:06.330> gain<00:04:06.540> in<00:04:06.660> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
channel so not only is there gain in the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:07.780 
channel so not only is there gain in the
front<00:04:07.050> but<00:04:07.200> there's<00:04:07.380> one<00:04:07.530> on<00:04:07.620> the<00:04:07.709> back

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
front but there's one on the back

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:10.250 
front but there's one on the back
there's<00:04:08.790> also<00:04:09.000> a<00:04:09.150> switch<00:04:09.450> for<00:04:09.630> phantom<00:04:10.050> power

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
there's also a switch for phantom power

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.750 
there's also a switch for phantom power
if<00:04:10.500> you<00:04:10.530> happen<00:04:10.830> to<00:04:10.860> be<00:04:10.950> using<00:04:11.160> condenser

if you happen to be using condenser

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.430 
if you happen to be using condenser
microphones<00:04:12.270> that<00:04:12.420> require<00:04:12.780> phantom<00:04:13.080> power

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
microphones that require phantom power

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.830 
microphones that require phantom power
