00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.610
 Hello 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.399
 ah 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.910
 very good to two kids welcome to 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.860
 this new dead motorcycle guide 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.750
 I am price 115 and in this video we are going to 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.950
 see how to get it uplander gat and its 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.029
 three improved versions 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.860
 the cidh cat the sweep sweeper and 

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:26.810
 Vitamin liquid erin or withered into 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:28.279
 corrosive then the first thing that touches 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.260
 does get the talk of the cat the 

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.269
 we can get in the magic box as 

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:34.160
 you are watching or also through five 

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:36.620
 blue skulls that we will have to 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.720
 I'll teach in another video it's about the 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:41.330
 wonder wipo in the magical weapon of the map 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.059
 a shotgun the first magic weapon of 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.469
 black ops 2 that you do not have to build 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:46.940
 has four guns that fire 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:48.739
 all at once so it has to be 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.930
 firing firing firing 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:52.660
 recharging but it's quite effective 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.500
 against large groups of zombies 

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.690
 starting from this blanc der garde 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.090
 we can do two things or we improve it 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.359
 in the pack a punch or we add acid 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.620
 with a kit then if we improve it already 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.050
 you know that the avante pack is in the 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.430
 bridge we will get the sweeper or the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.440
 sweet park that has double 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.420
 ammunition that speak of the 120 bullets 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.640
 and has two bullets in the charger 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.380
 that is, we shoot one we shoot another 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.040
 and then we reload instead of shooting 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.900
 once as the talk about the cat 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.790
 but then we have the other option 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.650
 that would be adding acid then for 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.050
 this we have to collect three pieces each 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.490
 one of them has three locations 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.470
 the first piece of the briefcase in the area 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.270
 of the cells and can appear here at 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.070
 side of the bookstore but you can also 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.510
 appear here right on the other end in 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.280
 the hallway that takes you until 3 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.560
 guards last the last 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.870
 location is here in the room the mp5 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.790
 in this little corner 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.830
 the second piece of the engine that is in 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.660
 the warden's room may appear in 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.430
 this area down here below the uci 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.190
 but you can also go to the left 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.050
 from the box or next to the fireplace after 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.550
 this we are going to move on to our third 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.680
 piece found in the infirmary 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.570
 can be by several places can 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.460
 be here in this little corner or if not 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.530
 here in this other corner right on the 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.210
 next room another option is that 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.870
 you also appear here in the hall 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:08.060
 this one that is on top of this table 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.220
 after having the three pieces we assemble the 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.930
 acid kit where we will introduce 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.450
 the blanc der garde getting his 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.140
 improved version the aacid cat and also 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:20.210
 achieved the achievement or acid drop trophy on 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.370
 Spur is a shotgun that shoots 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.110
 acid bullets that stick like the ones in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.390
 texas to the zombies or to the walls and 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.280
 it explodes a few seconds but it exists 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.900
 a third improved way of talking about 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.420
 Latex is in the first weapon that has 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.550
 three improved versions is called vitro 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.190
 liquid erin or corrosive wilt 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.870
 in Spanish how to get very simple 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.090
 if you have the speak der garde and 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.040
 improvements from his father in the pack to punch 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.080
 Well, if you put your peers in the 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.450
 acid kit will become glass 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.250
 liquid erin corrosive withering and 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:51.680
 then in the same way if you have the speak 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.360
 der garde and the raisins adicat if then 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.860
 we put the typical in the pay punch 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.930
 we will also get the vitriolic 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.700
 whiting this gun is pretty good 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.650
 because in addition their acid bullets act 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.720
 as monkeys or as the piles of the 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.050
 improved crossbow that attract all 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.000
 zombies 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.380
 in short having the talk of gatt 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.940
 you can improve it and get the 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:11.160
 sweeper but you can also add 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.080
 acid and get the activity improving 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.960
 the a-5 or adding acid to the sweeper 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.580
 you will get vitriol and widder in and nothing 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.560
 more I hope you have served this 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.340
 video a greeting and we do not see video 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.340
 goodbye
