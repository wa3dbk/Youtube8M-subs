00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.369
 tastes as good as a seat on the 

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:15.509
 Somehow it does not look that good 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.490

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.170

 made with butter and strawberry jam 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.409
 The bread is very light and unfortunately 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.540
 it breaks very easily if you can 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.329

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.329
