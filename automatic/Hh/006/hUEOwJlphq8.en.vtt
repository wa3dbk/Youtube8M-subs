this one this part is stamping I started
using<00:01:01.579> stamps<00:01:02.149> because<00:01:02.450> I<00:01:02.540> had<00:01:02.690> to<00:01:02.870> I<00:01:03.110> had<00:01:03.920> to

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
using stamps because I had to I had to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.100 
using stamps because I had to I had to
do<00:01:04.579> so<00:01:04.820> many<00:01:05.030> paintings<00:01:05.299> and<00:01:05.600> I<00:01:05.659> had<00:01:05.780> to<00:01:05.869> find

do so many paintings and I had to find
ways<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.649> paint<00:01:06.860> more<00:01:07.310> quickly<00:01:07.610> I<00:01:08.829> was<00:01:09.829> lucky

00:01:10.599 --> 00:01:10.609 
ways to paint more quickly I was lucky

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:13.169 
ways to paint more quickly I was lucky
in<00:01:10.639> that<00:01:10.999> the<00:01:11.479> things<00:01:11.749> I<00:01:11.869> was<00:01:11.990> interested<00:01:12.170> him

in that the things I was interested him

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:17.550 
in that the things I was interested him
later<00:01:14.179> on<00:01:14.389> became<00:01:14.749> more<00:01:15.049> popular<00:01:15.259> for<00:01:16.069> example

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
later on became more popular for example

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.769 
later on became more popular for example
performance<00:01:18.560> and<00:01:18.799> conceptual<00:01:19.340> art<00:01:19.520> later<00:01:20.479> on

00:01:20.769 --> 00:01:20.779 
performance and conceptual art later on

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:23.679 
performance and conceptual art later on
became<00:01:21.170> the<00:01:21.679> norm<00:01:22.060> and<00:01:23.060> then<00:01:23.359> when<00:01:23.509> I<00:01:23.600> got

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
became the norm and then when I got

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.389 
became the norm and then when I got
