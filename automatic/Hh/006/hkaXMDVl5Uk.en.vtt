and<00:03:25.290> I'd<00:03:25.950> like<00:03:26.070> to<00:03:26.130> see<00:03:26.340> if<00:03:26.430> Ursa<00:03:26.640> has<00:03:26.910> a

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
and I'd like to see if Ursa has a

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.400 
and I'd like to see if Ursa has a
sentence<00:03:27.360> as<00:03:27.480> well<00:03:27.600> since<00:03:27.840> she<00:03:27.990> was<00:03:28.110> also<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
sentence as well since she was also a

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.050 
sentence as well since she was also a
part<00:03:28.620> of<00:03:28.650> the<00:03:28.770> reason<00:03:28.980> why<00:03:29.070> he<00:03:29.100> members<00:03:29.580> went

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
part of the reason why he members went

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.260 
part of the reason why he members went
missing<00:03:30.420> for<00:03:30.570> six<00:03:30.750> months<00:03:31.190> so<00:03:32.190> it<00:03:32.760> was<00:03:32.940> really

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:33.270 
missing for six months so it was really

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.690 
missing for six months so it was really

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
about that there are some people that

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:05.450 
about that there are some people that
have<00:04:02.910> guessed<00:04:03.180> that<00:04:03.480> Makarov<00:04:04.470> is<00:04:04.740> actually

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:05.460 
have guessed that Makarov is actually

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:06.770 
have guessed that Makarov is actually
the<00:04:05.550> priest<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.300> he's<00:04:06.480> heading<00:04:06.750> this

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
the priest and that he's heading this

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.100 
the priest and that he's heading this
entire<00:04:07.230> thing<00:04:07.560> up<00:04:07.770> I<00:04:08.010> can't<00:04:08.880> understand<00:04:09.660> why

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
entire thing up I can't understand why

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:12.560 
entire thing up I can't understand why
that<00:04:10.410> would<00:04:10.560> be<00:04:10.680> Makarov<00:04:11.100> if<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.090> not<00:04:12.330> girl

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
that would be Makarov if it is not girl

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.570 
that would be Makarov if it is not girl
it<00:04:12.780> would<00:04:12.870> understand<00:04:13.290> it<00:04:13.560> would<00:04:13.650> explain<00:04:14.010> why

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
it would understand it would explain why

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.280 
it would understand it would explain why
he<00:04:14.910> knew<00:04:15.150> that<00:04:15.360> fairy<00:04:15.570> tale<00:04:15.810> would<00:04:15.930> show<00:04:16.140> up

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
he knew that fairy tale would show up

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.580 
he knew that fairy tale would show up
like<00:04:16.530> this<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.040> I<00:04:18.000> still<00:04:18.780> have<00:04:18.989> a<00:04:19.020> very<00:04:19.109> hard

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
like this but I still have a very hard

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.349 
like this but I still have a very hard
time<00:04:19.859> believing<00:04:20.280> that<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.670> would<00:04:20.790> be<00:04:20.910> Makarov

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
time believing that it would be Makarov

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.880 
time believing that it would be Makarov
this<00:04:21.870> would<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.080> a<00:04:22.109> very<00:04:22.290> interesting<00:04:22.560> time

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:22.890 
this would be a very interesting time

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:24.200 
this would be a very interesting time
for<00:04:22.919> him<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.250> show<00:04:23.370> up<00:04:23.610> though<00:04:23.730> if<00:04:23.880> the

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
for him to show up though if the

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.820 
for him to show up though if the
purification<00:04:24.780> process<00:04:25.110> did<00:04:25.290> start<00:04:25.560> up<00:04:25.680> and

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
purification process did start up and

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.860 
purification process did start up and
actually<00:04:25.950> got<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.340> be<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.640> huge<00:04:27.000> threat

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
actually got to be a huge threat

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.570 
actually got to be a huge threat
now<00:04:28.320> would<00:04:28.500> be<00:04:28.530> a<00:04:28.620> fun<00:04:28.830> time<00:04:28.949> for<00:04:29.010> Makarov<00:04:29.430> to

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:29.580 
now would be a fun time for Makarov to

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.460 
now would be a fun time for Makarov to
show<00:04:29.699> up<00:04:29.850> just<00:04:29.880> just<00:04:30.300> because<00:04:30.810> we've<00:04:31.320> already

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
show up just just because we've already

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:32.810 
show up just just because we've already
got<00:04:31.710> everyone<00:04:32.160> showing<00:04:32.490> up<00:04:32.580> in<00:04:32.699> all

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
got everyone showing up in all

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.700 
got everyone showing up in all
directions<00:04:32.940> why<00:04:33.419> not

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:34.710 
directions why not

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:36.920 
directions why not
but<00:04:35.250> that's<00:04:35.699> one<00:04:35.910> theory<00:04:36.240> as<00:04:36.360> to<00:04:36.419> why<00:04:36.630> he<00:04:36.780> could

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:36.930 
but that's one theory as to why he could

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.409 
but that's one theory as to why he could
possibly<00:04:37.110> understand<00:04:37.800> what's<00:04:37.979> going<00:04:38.220> on<00:04:38.419> but

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
possibly understand what's going on but

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:40.969 
possibly understand what's going on but
at<00:04:39.690> the<00:04:39.810> very<00:04:39.960> least<00:04:40.080> he<00:04:40.290> might<00:04:40.440> be<00:04:40.590> someone

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
at the very least he might be someone

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:43.939 
at the very least he might be someone
and<00:04:41.910> I<00:04:42.360> apologize<00:04:42.900> I've<00:04:43.169> actually<00:04:43.470> only<00:04:43.680> read

00:04:43.939 --> 00:04:43.949 
and I apologize I've actually only read

00:04:43.949 --> 00:04:45.200 
and I apologize I've actually only read
like<00:04:44.070> the<00:04:44.190> first<00:04:44.220> two<00:04:44.520> chapters<00:04:44.910> of<00:04:44.940> fairy

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
like the first two chapters of fairy

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.930 
like the first two chapters of fairy
tale<00:04:45.479> zero<00:04:45.860> I'm<00:04:46.860> gonna<00:04:47.070> go<00:04:47.280> actually<00:04:47.460> finish

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
tale zero I'm gonna go actually finish

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.850 
tale zero I'm gonna go actually finish
that<00:04:48.120> tonight<00:04:48.300> but<00:04:49.229> I've<00:04:49.410> just<00:04:49.440> been<00:04:49.710> super

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
that tonight but I've just been super

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.350 
that tonight but I've just been super
behind<00:04:50.100> because<00:04:50.520> of<00:04:50.639> work<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:50.910> everything

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
behind because of work and everything

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.990 
behind because of work and everything
but<00:04:51.660> he<00:04:52.650> might<00:04:52.830> even<00:04:52.979> be<00:04:53.130> someone<00:04:53.460> from<00:04:53.820> that

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
but he might even be someone from that

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.290 
but he might even be someone from that
someone<00:04:54.360> related<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.870> fairy<00:04:55.290> tale<00:04:55.530> but<00:04:56.370> I<00:04:56.520> just

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
someone related to fairy tale but I just

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.640 
someone related to fairy tale but I just
the<00:04:57.449> fact<00:04:57.630> that<00:04:57.660> he's<00:04:57.840> calculated<00:04:58.320> fairy<00:04:58.470> tale

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
the fact that he's calculated fairy tale

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.590 
the fact that he's calculated fairy tale
in<00:04:58.830> and<00:04:59.070> is<00:04:59.280> possibly<00:04:59.639> even<00:04:59.820> using<00:05:00.180> him<00:05:00.330> in<00:05:00.360> his

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
in and is possibly even using him in his

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.409 
in and is possibly even using him in his
plans<00:05:00.900> um<00:05:01.460> sounds<00:05:02.460> a<00:05:02.639> little<00:05:02.729> odd<00:05:02.910> to<00:05:03.120> me<00:05:03.150> like

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
plans um sounds a little odd to me like

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.900

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
I'm really excited for next I'd assume

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.300

that<00:05:13.050> we're<00:05:13.169> getting<00:05:13.260> chapters<00:05:13.740> are<00:05:14.070> we<00:05:14.190> gonna

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:16.380 
get a chapter next week because I don't

think<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.740> these<00:05:16.919> two<00:05:17.160> chapters<00:05:17.550> were

supposed to be released this week they

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.969 
supposed to be released this week they
might<00:05:20.639> have<00:05:20.789> been<00:05:20.940> for<00:05:21.690> next<00:05:22.139> week<00:05:22.320> but<00:05:22.860> they

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:22.979 
might have been for next week but they
