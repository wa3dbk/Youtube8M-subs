00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:56.350
 It is known though 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:01:00.900
 I think that the transmitted Well because people talk to say Jiro Horikoshi was the Zero fighter of design to Fu 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.540
 In a word, Miyazaki Hayao's war that does not make this movie 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.550
 I wonder if it will come out 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:12.490
 What is wrong with this is not temporary 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:15.520
 What kind of things when I also war it is quite warlike people such a person to come dating between now 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:20.679
 I'm interested in making it 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:24.300
 I I say other than Te calibrated Yo so I'm warlike seen me Shiga mountain doing Nante the 1 gold 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:26.370
 It's not going to make a warlike movie 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.710
 I was very interested in it 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:33.510
 So I told you to do some household chores etc. It was summer about three years ago 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.920
 But I is 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:39.830
 Everyone who is not like Ace if you know 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.730
 Oro' and I got angry really 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.710
 Become me 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.180
 I found something 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.700
 Fishers do not think what 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.800
 Oh my dear people 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.180
 I wonder 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:56.880
 Animation I have an idea that I should have 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.790
 Wings of Tteyuu movie written in meeting 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.250
 It is what children see as a rule 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.230
 In short, your rattan 7 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.550
 Don't care 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.510
 That's why I say it is wrong as a plan 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:14.000
 Certainly that's right, but 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.850
 People who are everyone I have come along 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.540
 Another me anyway no day-to-day talking 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:22.560
 But to improve the doodle 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:26.250
 I am writing something immediately I fighter 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.319
 That's right-I say that I'm good at relationships 

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.859
 Then there is a person called you guys 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.859
 war 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.260
 I knew it well 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.370
 I know that 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.960
 Live in the magazine for 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:44.569
 I wish I chained 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.940
 Shouldn't we head over it? 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:51.870
 I feel like that 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:54.540
 In fact, it did not blow even if it was screamed, then the second floor, the third floor, the fourth floor east 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.819
 In fact, we will have to talk many times 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.040
 My thoughts on you guys 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.220
 I though I each also 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.490
 It sounds I certainly 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:12.560
 It was a plan I was targeting 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:16.340
 I still I that kind of thing something is somewhere you will regret it later you can not keep doing 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.400
 What I thought was that if I fell, it was just that 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.819
 I think it's about October in Okinawa 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.140
 It's a figure that I understand 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:26.970
 Think in the car 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:32.450
 Do you want to try it yourself? 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.450
 I've left a bit of that story for a while now 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:38.390
 It's about when you're imminent from everyone 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.250
 Still started
