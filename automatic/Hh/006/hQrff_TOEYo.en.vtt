00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.680
 you me 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.310
 so this is drift 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.900
 we start with 5 frets 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.550
 as I have shown in other videos very 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.070
 often you probably also noticed that we 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.240
 play usually use fourth 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.830
 third string 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:17.020
 here it is quarts and we do it by clamping 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.270
 first fingers of them at the same time here 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:23.979
 let it be comfortable if we are two this 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:27.960
 however a inconveniently once 2 1 building 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.840
 that is, here peaks slide mediator 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.290
 chiefs and then he offers odiously 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.170
 under to then go straight to the clutch 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.130
 then we hold on the fifth fret 4 third 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:48.190
 the string would also find 5 down 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.610
 Open is the beginning of further 5 string and 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.610
