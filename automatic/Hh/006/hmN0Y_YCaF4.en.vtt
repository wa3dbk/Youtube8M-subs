okay
so<00:01:54.720> what<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.899> used<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.290> use<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.950> boar<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.759> nylon

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
so what I used to use to boar the nylon

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.639 
so what I used to use to boar the nylon
bristles<00:01:57.479> where<00:01:57.630> at<00:01:57.719> least<00:01:57.990> twice<00:01:58.350> as<00:01:58.619> thick

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
bristles where at least twice as thick

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
bristles where at least twice as thick
which<00:01:59.189> means<00:01:59.399> that's<00:01:59.579> what's<00:01:59.880> gliding

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
which means that's what's gliding

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.850 
which means that's what's gliding
through<00:02:00.420> your<00:02:00.780> hair<00:02:00.990> so<00:02:01.500> if<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:01.740> have<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
through your hair so if you have a

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.200 
through your hair so if you have a
thicker<00:02:02.189> bristle<00:02:02.610> gliding<00:02:02.969> through<00:02:03.000> your

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
thicker bristle gliding through your

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.969 
thicker bristle gliding through your
hair<00:02:03.360> how<00:02:03.780> smooth<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.290> how<00:02:04.350> polished<00:02:04.860> you

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
hair how smooth and how polished you

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.889 
hair how smooth and how polished you
really<00:02:05.250> think<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:05.610> gonna<00:02:05.759> be<00:02:06.000> because<00:02:06.750> it's

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
really think it's gonna be because it's

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.080 
really think it's gonna be because it's
gonna<00:02:07.290> be<00:02:07.469> like<00:02:07.590> my<00:02:07.619> fingers<00:02:08.129> versus<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.819> comb

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
gonna be like my fingers versus a comb

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.390 
gonna be like my fingers versus a comb
okay<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.470> going<00:02:10.649> to<00:02:10.770> be<00:02:10.920> more<00:02:11.129> polished

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
okay so it's going to be more polished

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.550 
okay so it's going to be more polished
more<00:02:11.790> smooth

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
more smooth

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.740 
more smooth

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
the handles of my brushes because they

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.220
