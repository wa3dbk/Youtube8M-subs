have it you know be fully functionally

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.980 
have it you know be fully functionally
afterwards<00:04:32.220> so<00:04:32.490> no<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:33.180> is<00:04:33.390> this<00:04:33.690> is<00:04:33.810> really

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
afterwards so no this is this is really

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.020 
afterwards so no this is this is really
good<00:04:34.260> as<00:04:34.380> far<00:04:34.410> as<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.340> know<00:04:35.430> we<00:04:35.550> can<00:04:35.640> discuss

this verse the the waterproof matches
you<00:04:39.150> know<00:04:39.240> I<00:04:39.300> guess<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.720> ends<00:04:39.900> up<00:04:40.050> being

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
you know I guess that ends up being

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.490 
you know I guess that ends up being
preference<00:04:41.180> but<00:04:42.180> certainly<00:04:42.690> both<00:04:42.990> products

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:43.500 
preference but certainly both products

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.530 
preference but certainly both products
that<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:43.770> tried<00:04:44.010> were<00:04:44.250> real<00:04:44.700> good<00:04:44.940> both<00:04:45.330> of

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
that we tried were real good both of

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.080 
that we tried were real good both of
them<00:04:45.630> worked<00:04:45.930> after<00:04:46.350> being<00:04:46.590> being<00:04:47.160> wet<00:04:47.490> me

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
them worked after being being wet me

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.090 
them worked after being being wet me
myself<00:04:48.300> I<00:04:49.670> kind<00:04:50.670> of<00:04:50.700> like<00:04:50.910> the<00:04:51.090> lighter<00:04:51.330> more
