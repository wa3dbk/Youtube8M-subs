00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.979
 cordial greeting my name is mario germán 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:08.530
 clear gel I'm a department teacher 

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:12.330
 humanities and arts and I'm giving the 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.330
 episteme course and knowledge 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.450
 the concept of episteme has a strong 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.710
 tradition in the knowledge of 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:25.970
 humanity and platón defined it as the 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.210
 scientific knowledge par excellence 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.789
 that differentiates it from opinion or from 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.410
 mere bag in which the 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.989
 strictness 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.989
 the episteme is the soil 

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:46.550
 sustains knowing the knowledge the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.370
 paradigm and all scientific discourse without 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:54.000
 she is impossible 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 all this epistemological scaffolding 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.220
 the episteme therefore produces a 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.220
 know produces knowledge 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:07.000
 she is within a context 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:10.690
 historical than according to the time according to 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.210
 interests so the episteme moves and the 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.700
 move well the episteme also moves 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.980
 a culture also moves a 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.780
 paradigm and also moves the 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:26.100
 scientific knowledge the episteme 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.480
 allows a knowledge traffic that is 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.650
 interrelate to build what 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:35.770
 it would be a knowing a knowledge that is going to 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.960
 depend on the historical context can 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.450
 be a knowledge depending on the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.740
 long-term needs 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:47.170
 historical or very short history 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:49.600
 historical consequently when 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.400
 we talk about the episteme is not 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.850
 saying that to produce a series of 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.790
 speeches initially or to know those 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.670
 highly rigorous knowledge that 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.360
 can belong to a culture and that 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.530
 they produce specialized knowledge 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 Thus 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.300
 it produces a whole interest of order 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.060
 epistemological because when we 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.220
 we talk about epistemology this is a 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.190
 compound word that means logy 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.330
 and episteme what the study has tried 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.120
 of the episteme therefore everything 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:29.200
 knowledge of epistemological order and 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:32.200
 all know scientist will depend on 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.500
 what determines the episteme for a 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.680
 certain period it should be noted that 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:41.800
 the episteme does not necessarily have to 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.860
 be of scientific order all episteme 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.290
 may have different characteristics 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.420
 'despite cultural issues the episteme in a 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:54.390
 know certain example the episteme 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:56.760
 of communication the episteme of the 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.620
 contemporary advertising can also 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.709
 talk about history episteme 

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:05.670
 philosophy etcetera what is clear 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:09.330
 to leave is that the episteme is the one that enters 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:12.180
 to play the determining role of all 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:15.450
 know and all knowledge without it 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.670
 we could say again I repeat that it is 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.709
 impossible the construction of a 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.480
 paradigm because the paradigm is going to 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:24.420
 depend on what the 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:26.670
 episteme at a time determined by 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:30.110
 So much when we talk about episteme 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.750
 we are talking about what sustains the 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:36.959
 behavior of a certain time 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:41.420
 of a certain culture or of several 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.420
 cultures in a specific way
