00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
healing happens afterwards you have to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:26.270 
healing happens afterwards you have to
have<00:03:24.180> these<00:03:24.360> conversations<00:03:25.010> so<00:03:26.010> are<00:03:26.160> you

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
have these conversations so are you

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:27.560 
have these conversations so are you
saying<00:03:26.490> that<00:03:26.730> you<00:03:26.850> almost<00:03:27.000> have<00:03:27.180> to<00:03:27.450> go

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570 
saying that you almost have to go

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.120 
saying that you almost have to go
through<00:03:27.810> some<00:03:27.990> of<00:03:28.080> these<00:03:28.170> arguments<00:03:28.530> and<00:03:28.920> let

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
through some of these arguments and let

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:31.130 
through some of these arguments and let
them<00:03:29.310> write<00:03:29.550> out<00:03:29.730> and<00:03:30.030> then<00:03:30.570> have<00:03:30.990> the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
them write out and then have the

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.930 
them write out and then have the
awareness<00:03:31.380> afterwards<00:03:32.160> to<00:03:32.430> go<00:03:32.550> back<00:03:32.760> and

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
awareness afterwards to go back and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.560 
awareness afterwards to go back and
revisit<00:03:33.120> and<00:03:33.690> hopefully<00:03:34.320> there<00:03:35.280> is<00:03:35.310> that<00:03:35.730> that

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
revisit and hopefully there is that that

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.300 
revisit and hopefully there is that that
level<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:36.990> awareness<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:37.740> it<00:03:37.860> doesn't<00:03:38.160> yeah

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
level of awareness that it doesn't yeah

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.880 
level of awareness that it doesn't yeah
fight<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.360> because<00:03:39.690> I'm<00:03:39.960> working<00:03:40.350> with<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.530> a
