 annually claim more than three lives 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.540
 million people around the world more 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.600
 total suffering from these insects 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.460
 African countries themselves bite malaria 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.119
 mosquitoes and mosquitoes are not dangerous for living 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.730
 creatures 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.490
 but the parasites contained in their saliva 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.619
 penetrate the victim's blood causing a dangerous 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.019
 disease 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.590
 bees can be very dangerous sting

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.440
 small bag of venom wild bees 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.690
 attack with a whole swarm 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.520
 escape from them is almost impossible 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 because alarmed bees 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.899
 stalking the victim constantly squeezed her in 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.149
 the result of a lot of poison 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:51.059
 the person entering the body dies 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:53.399
 from exogenous intoxication pretty 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.190
 allergic reactions to 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.960
 bee stings like blades that are heavy 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.629
 cases may result in death from 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.420
 suffocation victims of scorpions and spiders 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.309
 become thousands of people a year if 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.560
 scorpions can only boast 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 one deadly poisonous fellow then 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.450
 spiders representing a danger to 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.090
 a lot of people like 1 gram 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.320
 the poison of the Brazilian soldier spider is enough 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.990
 to kill 10 adult male snakes alone 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.270
 of the most dangerous creatures on the planet on 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.290
 their consciences are over 50 thousand human 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.439
 deaths per year 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.150
 among snakes the most dangerous are 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.680
 sandy efa royal cobra and 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.409
 asian cobra 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.960
 if the last two snakes are not aggressive 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.549
 sand efah often attacks itself 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.900
 people 

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:42.060
 to be dangerous animals not 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:44.280
 sure to be poisonous it 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.070
 assertion prove small 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.049
 pirate fish toothy aggressive fish with 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.820
 very sharp teeth incredible 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.880
 with appetite they attack any living thing 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.009
 being caught in water is worth only 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.500
 remember the case when piranhas ate 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.390
 300 people alive trying to escape 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.110
 from a wrecked ship 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.450
 their danger becomes indisputable lions 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.399
 and tigers pose a threat to humans 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.619
 wild cat attack 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.049
 few 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.790
 these predators are perfectly adapted for 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.980
 animal killings are much bigger 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.230
 human therefore people should be 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.760
 careful with them to remember that sensing 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.140
 physical or moral weakness 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.989
 human wild cats can attack 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.670
 hippos being herbivores 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:31.430
 kill more people than others 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.650
 the inhabitants of the shroud lions and tigers crocodiles and 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.019
 other hippos are large 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.190
 great weight they swim well even 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.470
 can sleep in the water 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.329
 subcutaneous fat keeps them afloat about 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.040
 membranes between fingers help 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.989
 do all this allows these 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.000
 mammals turn over boats and 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.549
 to attack people in the water 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.799
 hippopotamus settled near villages and 

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.200
 villages can eat all night 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:56.120
 vegetation in the fields awkward 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.609
 animals spoil things and small 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.980
 buildings for the inhabitants of these populated 

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:02.560
 hippo items become real 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.970
 natural disaster 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:06.769
 despite the fact that elephants produce 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:09.620
 impression of wise calm animals 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.690
 they are not always so 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.419
 absolutely not important accustomed animal 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.250
 or lives in the wild elephants are killed annually 

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:18.200
 about 600 people 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:20.239
 they are able to catch up with the car 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.319
 moving on uneven ground and 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:23.900
 attack him 

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:26.000
 to say nothing of the fact that the person 6 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.910
 tons and and giants can easily trample 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.889
 or pierce the tusk the most dangerous in their 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.930
 behavior 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:33.530
 unpredictability of elephants especially living 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.750
 captive 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.480
 attack without apparent reason unexpectedly 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:42.349
 such attacks always have a deadly 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.900
 outcome bears these animals several times 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:47.299
 bigger than the chuntiest man they have 

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.340
 sharp teeth and claws strong paws big 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.349
 weight bears run fast not bad 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.319
 swim and climb trees well 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.120
 they also have a great nose for a person without 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:59.049
 the weapons of the bear that met him 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:01.220
 territory very little chance of salvation 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.319
 some scientists give palm 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.260
 crocodile championship 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:08.720
 the danger levels of these reptiles are different 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.299
 some do not attack people at all others 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:13.160
 only in some places to cast and very 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.500
 dangerous are capable of not only unexpectedly 

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.419
 attack a man but also chase him 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.640
 annually crocodile and become 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.280
 perpetrators of more than two thousand 

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.810
 human deaths 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.150
 wild bull 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.639
 whether bunting is the most dangerous hoofed 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.740
 animal these bulls rarely kill people but 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.810
 wild bulls attack quite often 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.000
 being large animals with sharp 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.820
 horns are very aggressive and fierce 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.840
 especially males and pregnant females and to 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:39.760
 the same shy 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.310
 fear makes them not run away 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.250
 danger and destroy you on this 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.290
 meeting a banting person is better not 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.720
 risk caution without sudden movements 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:50.850
 move away and go out of sight 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.260
 bk 

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.330
 thanks to the movie pretty well 

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.280
 The opinion was that the sharks were the most 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.950
 sea ​​predators dangerous for humans 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.870
 partially so in water in size and 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:04.570
 danger shark second only to 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:07.600
 rainfall but annually sharks kill people 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.430
 less than even the elephants are the most distinguished 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.979
 and bitten a great white shark and 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:14.410
 mako shark is also worth noting that 

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:17.290
 the victims of these big fish becomes 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.900
 about 300 people a year and people kill in 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.919
 including for entertainment about 10 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.290
 million sharks 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.630
 annually for the last fifty years 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.630
 the number of sharks decreased almost 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.320
 three times orca by the way more dangerous than 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.080
 sharks 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.919
 they are known for their intelligence 

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.169
 ingenuity when attacking and 

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:37.000
 ability to retaliate to offenders 

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:39.550
 less killer whales even less often than sharks 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.110
 attack people but no matter how dangerous 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.419
 there were no animals they could not 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:45.100
 compare with the man himself people die 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:47.860
 at the hands of their brethren through negligence 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.650
 or inattention dies in traffic accident 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.510
 many diseases are taking their lives 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.280
 which thousands of people die is nothing 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:56.130
 like the consequences of human 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.020
 activities and lifestyle 

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:01.479
 subscribe to our second world project 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:04.500
 time unsolved mysteries and unique 

00:06:01.479 --> 00:06:04.500
 cases from around the world 

00:06:09.249 --> 00:06:13.689
 inspector checking some school 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:15.999
 noticed that whenever he asked for a class 

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:18.669
 question in response pulling hands all students 

00:06:15.999 --> 00:06:20.889
 more so although the school teacher every 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.809
 once the other student chose the answer is always 

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:24.809
 was correct how it worked
