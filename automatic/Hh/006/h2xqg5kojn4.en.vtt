00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.530
 how 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.340
 hola soy carlos and order welcome 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.320
 my channel where you will learn exercises and 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.090
 tips to take your game or the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.010
 of your players to another level in 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.690
 this first video we are going to talk about 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.520
 the strength for me is the most 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:25.920
 important in a player since 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.080
 we achieve two objectives prevention of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.080
 injuries and increase our performance 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:34.520
 to do a good job of strength 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.080
 in basketball it is no longer enough 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.880
 the conventional exercises of always 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.680
 you have to try adding variants 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.210
 specific to our sport in the 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.500
 basketball the instability is 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:44.270
 present in all movements 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.910
 specific actions that the player makes in 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.840
 track it is important to train movements 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.840
 and not muscles 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.530
 and 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.610
 then we will show you 5 of the 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.320
 better exercises to improve 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.320
 specific strength in basketball 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.590
 it is a stride exercise but 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:14.600
 multidirectional with which we will improve 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.359
 in our movements and gestures 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.219
 technicians like the exits the movement 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.500
 of the arms we make them to create 

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:24.909
 more instability in the exercise with what 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.909
 that we will also work the cole 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.229
 you have to always keep in position 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.090
 basic game with the center 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.549
 low severity flexing legs 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.060
 the palms of life and not crouch the 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:36.060
 too much 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.130
 yes 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.250
 then we show you some 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.390
 variants of the exercise there are simply 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.380
 to take the ball to different 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.450
 addresses 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.970
 thus we increase the difficulty of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.740
 exercise at coordination levels 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.280
 balance concentration and activation 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.280
 of the cut 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.920
 for more experienced players other 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.990
 option is doing it with extra weight 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.220
 either a medicine ball or a disc of 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:15.220
 3 or 5 kilograms 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.540
 exercise that will help you increase 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.489
 strength for related technical gestures 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.290
 with the jump you have to carry the weight 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.360
 always towards the heel of the foot that is 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.190
 on the floor to try that the knee does not 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.660
 exceed the foot line in excess to 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.660
 avoid overloading in it 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.180
 with this exercise avoid overloading 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.890
 the back since it is intense and does not 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:44.450
 lack doing it with a lot of weight 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.220
 we also introduce in the touch of 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.220
 instability and cutting work 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.010
 for the variant of the exercise 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.660
 you just have to carry the ball 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.430
 to different directions 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.800
 thus we increase the difficulty 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.480
 intensity of the exercise we can also 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.810
 add that extra with a ball 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.810
 medicinal 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.260
 exercise that will improve your balance and 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.360
 will help you in all the technical gestures 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:17.040
 of the game improving the strength of your 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.480
 ankles which is the joint in the 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280
 that start and end all 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.379
 actions from the initial position 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.140
 making the gesture of the shot to only one 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:29.300
 leg we extend as much as possible in 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.300
 a single line without turning the hips 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.760
 we take the ball and the arms towards 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.140
 forward always making a law of 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.470
 flexion of the leg that is in the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.470
 ground 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.430
 for the variant of the exercise 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.650
 we increase the difficulty by doing the 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.720
 same gesture but dynamically 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.610
 It will seem like a simple exercise but if 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:55.110
 you have never worked the balance os 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.110
 It will be complicated when performing 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:09.049
 and exercise with which you will improve the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.000
 strength of your core 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.310
 the player is placed in position 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:16.190
 stride with leg flexion back 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.690
 straight and outstretched arms we make sure 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.090
 that is in tension with all the 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.160
 muscles activated with arms 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.470
 they will write numbers from 1 to 5 with a 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.260
 leg and from 6 to 10 with the other 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.600
 try not to move the body only the 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.680
 arms 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:31.680
 no no 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.380
 the exercise also to improve the 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:43.690
 core we put ourselves in position 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.520
 iron fully stretched with the 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.500
 arms below the perpendicular of the 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.510
 shoulders with the gluteus and dominating 

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:52.120
 active and avoiding hyperlordosis 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.300
 lumbar that is not curling too much 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.620
 back nor rectifying 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.480
 we make movements with our 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.130
 arms and legs preventing the trunk 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:02.590
 it moves us in excess always 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.300
 keeping a horizontal line for the 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.160
 today's video we have had tubes 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.140
 for 7 bits that our players 

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.680
 Macedonia that will play in Cartagena 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:10.680
 this year
