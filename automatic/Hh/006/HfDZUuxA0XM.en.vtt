00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.029
 to me 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.970
 a petroleum training for 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.339
 zones the weight training is not 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.619
 complicated any beginner you 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.779
 will say that the inclined prisoners are for 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.910
 the upper chest and those intended 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:35.390
 for the lower 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.330
 1 hector area to the upper opening with 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.489
 dumbbells on bench tilted lying down 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.470
 face up on a sloping bench 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:45.040
 holding two dumbbells with grip 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.019
 neutral the weights will be directly 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:51.180
 over the chest and the elbows will bend 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:54.060
 slightly throughout the tour 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:57.120
 inclined bench press lying on the mouth 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:01:00.390
 up on a bench at an angle of 30 a 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.360
 45 degrees to support the feet on the floor 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.420
 or a platform attached to the bar with 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.000
 grip lead separating the arms more 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.490
 that the width of the shoulders take it out of 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
 the supports and take it over the 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.140
 pectoral superior 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.440
 area 2 pectoral middle 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.930
 verdiblanca with dumbbells lying on his mouth 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:24.140
 up on a flat bench holding 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.970
 the dumbbells on both sides of the chest 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.460
 raise it up to stretch the arms without 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.580
 block the elbows or that the discs 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.640
 touch slowly lower the weight to the point 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:38.070
 starting machine pectoral with 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.320
 tractor in the device version of the 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.560
 Dumbbell openings on a flat bench 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.020
 and of the openings with pulleys in bank 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.759
 the device offers more control because 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.009
 allows to maintain the position of 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.270
 elbows along the entire 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.610
 travel interval

 internal chest area 3 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.010
 opening with pulley on the flat bench 

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.920
 this pulley version of the openings 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.200
 allows you to cross your hands in front to 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.310
 feel the movement differently 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.730
 increase travel interval 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:15.400
 area 4 external chest bench press with 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.920
 wide grip use an open grip 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.480
 reduces the range of travel and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.270
 imposes more stress on 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.810
 pectorals particularly in the area 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:28.630
 external media as well as on the shoulders

 room 5 lower pectoral 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:34.570
 pre declined in pulp and power place the 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:37.150
 bench between the supports and move it towards 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.970
 go back and forth until you find 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.830
 the right place the bar should touch the 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.770
 lower part of the pectorals the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.930
 low position grab the bar separating 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.110
 hands beyond the width of the 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.690
 shoulders crosses between pulleys grab them 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.360
 way to them and slightly bend the 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.090
 elbows if you understand it work the
