800 series some phones the only

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309

frankly<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.150> white<00:00:15.299> edition<00:00:15.509> of<00:00:15.780> foam<00:00:15.990> do

frankly the white edition of foam do

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.380 
frankly the white edition of foam do
take<00:00:16.440> longer<00:00:16.770> to<00:00:17.100> produce<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:17.789> it's<00:00:18.000> not

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
take longer to produce but it's not

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.910 
take longer to produce but it's not
really<00:00:18.779> like<00:00:19.130> the<00:00:20.810> the<00:00:21.810> company's<00:00:22.230> fault<00:00:22.560> it's

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
really like the the company's fault it's

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.540 
really like the the company's fault it's
just<00:00:23.189> how<00:00:23.480> science<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.630> um<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.920> know<00:00:26.039> when<00:00:26.369> the

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
just how science is um you know when the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.400 
just how science is um you know when the
when<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> white<00:00:27.150> phone<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.390> created<00:00:27.930> it<00:00:28.019> has<00:00:28.199> to

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
when a white phone is created it has to

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.450 
when a white phone is created it has to
be<00:00:28.529> UV<00:00:28.920> product<00:00:29.310> muv<00:00:29.939> protect<00:00:30.300> unprotected

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
be UV product muv protect unprotected

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.770 
be UV product muv protect unprotected
among<00:00:32.460> other<00:00:32.700> things<00:00:32.790> because<00:00:33.300> the<00:00:33.390> light<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
among other things because the light and

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.240 
among other things because the light and
everything<00:00:34.079> just<00:00:34.110> interacts<00:00:34.710> differently

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
everything just interacts differently

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.610 
everything just interacts differently
with<00:00:35.430> white<00:00:35.730> then<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.809> like<00:00:36.899> blue<00:00:37.200> or

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
with white then I just be like blue or

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.920 
with white then I just be like blue or
like<00:00:37.770> red<00:00:38.040> or<00:00:38.070> purple<00:00:38.460> whatever<00:00:38.910> right<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
like red or purple whatever right so

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.990 
like red or purple whatever right so
that's<00:00:40.110> why<00:00:40.230> why<00:00:41.129> it's<00:00:41.280> actually<00:00:41.610> is<00:00:41.700> harder

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
that's why why it's actually is harder

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.680 
that's why why it's actually is harder
to<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.770> actually<00:00:43.980> do<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:45.510> then

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
to you know actually do and then

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.660 
to you know actually do and then
actually<00:00:45.870> perfecting<00:00:46.710> the<00:00:46.829> color<00:00:47.070> white<00:00:47.399> is

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
actually perfecting the color white is

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.130 
actually perfecting the color white is
just<00:00:47.879> harder<00:00:48.270> than<00:00:48.300> every<00:00:48.750> other<00:00:48.780> color

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
just harder than every other color

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.869 
just harder than every other color
because<00:00:49.440> for<00:00:50.010> like<00:00:50.100> glue<00:00:50.370> or<00:00:50.520> something<00:00:50.640> if

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
because for like glue or something if

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.580 
because for like glue or something if
you<00:00:50.969> screw<00:00:51.329> up<00:00:51.360> out<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.539> day<00:00:51.780> access<00:00:52.140> to<00:00:52.289> get<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
you screw up out a day access to get the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.830 
you screw up out a day access to get the
production<00:00:53.100> companies<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.699> come<00:00:53.879> screws<00:00:54.570> up<00:00:54.719> a

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
production companies to come screws up a

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.450 
production companies to come screws up a
little<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.350> not<00:00:55.680> really<00:00:55.890> noticeable<00:00:56.160> with

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
little it's not really noticeable with

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.880 
little it's not really noticeable with
white<00:00:56.789> that<00:00:57.239> is<00:00:57.390> pretty<00:00:57.840> noticeable<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.739> can

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
white that is pretty noticeable you can

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.619 
white that is pretty noticeable you can
either<00:00:58.980> tell<00:00:59.280> if<00:00:59.399> it's<00:00:59.520> white<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.030> like<00:01:00.239> grey

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
either tell if it's white or like grey

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.319 
either tell if it's white or like grey
there's<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.410> big<00:01:01.829> difference<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.489> uh<00:01:02.520> here's

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
there's a big difference but uh here's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.789 
there's a big difference but uh here's
actually<00:01:03.570> look<00:01:03.809> pictures<00:01:04.229> you<00:01:04.350> can<00:01:04.439> check<00:01:04.680> it

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
actually look pictures you can check it

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.469 
actually look pictures you can check it
out<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.640> link<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:05.970> this<00:01:06.060> will<00:01:06.240> be<00:01:06.330> in<00:01:06.390> the

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
out on the link for this will be in the

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.810 
out on the link for this will be in the
description<00:01:06.570> below<00:01:07.100> but<00:01:08.100> like<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.250> said<00:01:08.490> it's

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
description below but like I said it's

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.240 
description below but like I said it's
exactly<00:01:09.390> like<00:01:09.450> the<00:01:09.900> Loom<00:01:10.200> yay<00:01:10.409> another<00:01:10.799> series

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
exactly like the Loom yay another series

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.000 
exactly like the Loom yay another series
it's<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.670> white<00:01:12.140> now<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.380> extremely

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
it's just white now this is extremely

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.890 
it's just white now this is extremely
good<00:01:14.369> white<00:01:14.580> I<00:01:14.610> mean<00:01:14.880> you<00:01:14.970> can<00:01:15.119> compare<00:01:15.509> to<00:01:15.540> the

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
good white I mean you can compare to the

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.289 
good white I mean you can compare to the
background<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:17.030> white<00:01:18.030> white

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
background of this which is white white

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.640 
background of this which is white white
and<00:01:18.600> then<00:01:18.689> you<00:01:18.810> can<00:01:18.960> compare<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
and then you can compare to this

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.100 
and then you can compare to this
obviously<00:01:20.400> there's<00:01:20.580> the<00:01:20.640> camera<00:01:21.390> quality<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
obviously there's the camera quality and

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.590 
obviously there's the camera quality and
the<00:01:22.170> lighting<00:01:22.380> etc<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.159> you<00:01:23.729> know<00:01:23.850> you<00:01:24.450> can

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
the lighting etc but you know you can

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.810 
the lighting etc but you know you can
compare<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.170> background<00:01:25.590> it's<00:01:25.740> white<00:01:26.009> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
compare to the background it's white a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.620 
compare to the background it's white a
very<00:01:27.750> nice<00:01:27.960> wide<00:01:28.229> at<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:29.460> guess<00:01:30.420> that's

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
very nice wide at that I guess that's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.210 
very nice wide at that I guess that's
what<00:01:30.840> they<00:01:30.960> took<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> little<00:01:31.560> while<00:01:31.799> to<00:01:32.070> do<00:01:32.189> i

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
what they took a little while to do i

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.609 
what they took a little while to do i
mean<00:01:32.579> i<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.360> lumia<00:01:33.659> 800<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.259> came<00:01:34.470> out

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
mean i think the lumia 800 it's came out

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.350 
mean i think the lumia 800 it's came out
a<00:01:34.650> few<00:01:34.770> months<00:01:35.040> ago<00:01:35.250> so<00:01:35.880> i<00:01:35.909> guess<00:01:36.060> it<00:01:36.180> took<00:01:36.270> a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
a few months ago so i guess it took a

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.149 
a few months ago so i guess it took a
few<00:01:36.540> months<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> white<00:01:37.470> dishing<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:37.860> come

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
few months for the white dishing to come

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.460 
few months for the white dishing to come
out<00:01:38.310> but<00:01:38.579> uh<00:01:38.640> i'm<00:01:39.360> actually<00:01:39.420> quite<00:01:39.960> satisfied

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
out but uh i'm actually quite satisfied

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.499 
out but uh i'm actually quite satisfied
with<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.650> wet<00:01:40.799> white<00:01:41.159> edition<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.909> looks<00:01:42.090> very

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
with a wet white edition it looks very

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.810 
with a wet white edition it looks very
nice<00:01:42.659> with<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:43.049> whole<00:01:43.259> black<00:01:43.740> screen<00:01:44.340> the

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
nice with the whole black screen the
