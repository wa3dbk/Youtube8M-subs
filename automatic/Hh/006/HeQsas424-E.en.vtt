00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 hello everyone today received a parcel with 

00:00:03.429 --> 00:00:09.220
 red dragon 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:13.540
 I want to share with you 

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:17.770
 impressions well, a knife here I will immediately say 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.010
 Chinese made knife copy knife 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.880
 if i'm not mistaken he's called 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.720
 benchmark bedlam so here is interesting 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:33.340
 the name was packed of course guys 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:37.559
 seriously for maxies i use my 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.559
 swollen swan narzanom 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.910
 today he specifically took no 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:56.510
 another knife because I knew that I would stop by 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.510
 Mail and I will have a package today 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:10.820
 so we inside box immediately make a reservation 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.680
 sold here these knives is why 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.680
 in the same section where knives are sold and 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.230
 multitools ganzo 

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:21.110
 Well, as if this fact surprised me a little 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.180
 because this knife is this one yourself 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:27.290
 see that he is without any logos 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:30.080
 without any brand values ​​to me 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.400
 just liked his handle like 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:36.650
 like his original grandparent 

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:48.820
 so how would I decide to purchase such 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:51.259
 the knife itself means become here on the blade 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.110
 how much I saw on the site information 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.530
 there is no information about the brand 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.530
 become 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.539
 so according to some sensations 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.020
 will have to draw any conclusions either 

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:10.729
 search for information on other sites 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.690
 here you can see the company logo 

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:17.920
 being made you say 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:21.610
 worth number 550 522 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.880
 axis lock is the same as on the hanza 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.890
 processing in principle without any 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.680
 jambs all clearly no backlash 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.030
 very comfortable handle but I know for sure that 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.530
 the fellow of this knife, that is, the original 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.950
 the original of this knife handle should be 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.410
 bit longer 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:47.990
 judging by the video review of other YouTube 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.960
 there are mostly american english-speaking 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.630
 review of this knife here 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:56.520
 it feels like basically the same 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.240
 are you a knife here that do where 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:03.480
 make ganzo knives 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.120
 if steel is on blades here if 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.070
 suggest that she if the same 440 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.770
 how is she ganzo g704 

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:15.050
 then in principle it is pretty good 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:18.770
 but such an update 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.770
 thank you all bye
