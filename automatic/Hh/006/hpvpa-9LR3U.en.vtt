00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
don't know but in my opinion is really

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.210 
don't know but in my opinion is really
like<00:01:26.400> comparing<00:01:27.299> an<00:01:28.049> apple<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.799> orange

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
like comparing an apple to an orange

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.580 
like comparing an apple to an orange
because<00:01:29.579> they're<00:01:29.759> so<00:01:29.970> different<00:01:30.409> and<00:01:31.409> what<00:01:31.560> I

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
because they're so different and what I

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.429 
because they're so different and what I
mean<00:01:31.829> by<00:01:31.890> that<00:01:32.159> okay<00:01:32.820> let's<00:01:33.750> take<00:01:33.930> the<00:01:34.079> orange

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
mean by that okay let's take the orange

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.429 
mean by that okay let's take the orange
here<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.130> example<00:01:35.570> the<00:01:36.570> orange<00:01:36.990> here<00:01:37.229> has<00:01:37.409> a

here for example the orange here has a

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.770 
here for example the orange here has a
skin<00:01:37.890> that's<00:01:38.780> inedible<00:01:39.799> it<00:01:40.799> has<00:01:41.790> slices<00:01:42.630> on

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
the inside and the slices are made up of

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.249 
the inside and the slices are made up of
watery<00:01:47.009> Pope<00:01:47.430> if<00:01:48.270> you<00:01:48.390> cut<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.750> half<00:01:48.810> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
watery Pope if you cut it in half you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.780 
watery Pope if you cut it in half you
can<00:01:49.409> squeeze<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.040> be<00:01:50.159> very<00:01:50.369> easy<00:01:50.610> to

can squeeze it and be very easy to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.510 
can squeeze it and be very easy to
produce<00:01:50.939> juice<00:01:51.509> out<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.979> juice<00:01:53.189> will

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
produce juice out of it the juice will

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.880 
produce juice out of it the juice will
cause<00:01:54.450> a<00:01:54.479> sticky<00:01:54.840> residue<00:01:54.930> on<00:01:55.320> your<00:01:55.409> hands<00:01:55.710> on

with boxing and MMA I think the only

have<00:02:28.319> are<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:29.190> seeds<00:02:29.459> and<00:02:29.790> when<00:02:30.569> you<00:02:30.810> look<00:02:31.620> at

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
have are the seeds and when you look at

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.020 
have are the seeds and when you look at
the<00:02:33.090> boxing<00:02:33.420> and<00:02:33.569> MMA<00:02:34.250> striking<00:02:35.250> with<00:02:35.760> both
