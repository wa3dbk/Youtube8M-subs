00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.340
 hello to all these crises in riom 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.840
 I hope you are well and we are 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.060
 found today on a new 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.849
 video a video that will show you 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:28.390
 how to install the ptr or call the 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.359
 rpt if it is the public realm of 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.300
 test so this is a beta test server 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.970
 in quotation marks open to all and who 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:40.269
 allows you to test in preview 

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:41.170
 all future updates of 

00:00:40.269 --> 00:00:44.320
 diablo iii 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.850
 so it's online sometimes and it's not 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.070
 all the time online this server from 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.340
 test but currently we are the 27 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:53.410
 June there is the 2.1 update which is 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:55.780
 deployed on the test server and that 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.960
 we can test to make 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.329
 returns to blizzard to improve the game 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.949
 to rebalance to denounce the bugs 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.570
 it is a little the principle had for 

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:06.330
 discover what are we going to have in 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.860
 this update 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.390
 this server is accessible to all 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.440
 world so I'm going to show you how 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.679
 install 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:17.520
 the first thing to do the simplest 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.840
 it's launching the battle.net application 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.509
 that you all know to go in the 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.149
 section diablo iii and you're going to have 

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:26.830
 a list box here for your server 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:28.660
 so you are I think all about the 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:32.380
 europe server and you will be able 

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.270
 select the rpt so public realm 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.539
 test or so the public ptr 

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:41.860
 Rwandan others like this here you 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:46.560
 so you can install this ptr 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:49.569
 but beware it's 2 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.849
 as much giga as the normal game so 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.020
 plan a lot of room on your 

00:01:51.849 --> 00:01:54.759
 Hard disk 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.250
 I will show you now a 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:59.979
 second method to install the ptr 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.220
 the second way to install the ptr is 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:06.099
 located on diablo on the official website of 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:07.929
 of pardon battle.net and so you have 

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:10.479
 just go there to log on 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.700
 your account so welcome christophe and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.030
 then you will be able to click on 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.170
 the section counts here present 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.880
 you will then be able to select 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.620
 diablo 3 you have 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.890
 in doubt a collector's standard edition 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.800
 or other and suddenly you will see here 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.700
 the public test realm available in 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.430
 downloading 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.010
 so here is the second way to install 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.630
 the ptr now let's see what happens 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:36.970
 when we connect for the first time 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:40.480
 once after launching the ptr you go 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.070
 arrive directly at the screen of 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.740
 creating a character 

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:47.320
 do not worry, just create 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.710
 any character we do not care a 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.750
 little 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:52.000
 once you are going to have created this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.630
 character you are going to get to the screen 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.190
 welcome with this created character but 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.590
 here at the top right you will be able 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:01.660
 select the region the server where 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.790
 you are normally like you are 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.560
 connected by battle.net and ben your 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.150
 account and already registered so there you 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.990
 just select europe for the 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:13.690
 most of you to copy 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:17.050
 the ptr will restart and you will have access 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.880
 to your entire account noted that there are 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.980
 we can not copy I think there 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.740
 72 hours between each 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.850
 copy of characters do not fool yourself 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.260
 because I believe that if you make a 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.140
 copy of america you are obliged 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.510
 to wait 72 hours to play 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.100
 and copy from europe server just 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.850
 because was corrected but it was the case 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.310
 previously 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.700
 here is I hope this video has you 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:43.240
 helped take advantage of these updates 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.650
 try hard and I tell you 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.650
 see you soon in a new video
