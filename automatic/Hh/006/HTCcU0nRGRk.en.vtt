00:00:05.079 --> 00:00:10.790
 all good health 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:15.110
 Here is such a strawberry hill 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:17.390
 me in the kitchen and still eat right here in 

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.260
 saucepan if i would talk 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:25.010
 more accurate then here are two buckets of strawberries 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:29.030
 I bought them this morning already she washed 

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:29.990
 ready to part of this clever 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:34.730
 it was seven 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:38.270
 start we have prepared for the future of all kinds 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.750
 as if storing strawberries we prefer 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:44.540
 freeze her how it is done as 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.350
 I do this and he will now show 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.950
 clean strawberries i stand up like this 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:54.320
 blender can crush strawberries manually 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.059
 it is as if not fundamentally further 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.210
 add sugar here process 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:04.479
 freezing the process of eating 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.600
 strawberries we kind of noticed that strawberries 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:11.899
 crushed sugar much tastier 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.240
 than he just has a new blender 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:19.459
 I do not know why, well, like so we 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:22.420
 do this recipe further nickname 

00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:22.420
 covered with 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:39.869
 Well, as if all strawberry puree I poured 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.340
 cups disposable cups 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.430
 ordinary plastic 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.789
 200 milliliters further this is mashed 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.090
 put on the shelf freezer 

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:54.439
 camera 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:59.610
 closes and you need to wait until all 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:04.770
 freeze after a day during this time my 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:06.569
 strawberries became hard she froze to 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:13.220
 game packaging 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:18.690
 regular tracing paper and each and cups 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:21.480
 Here in this bag and wraps this 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.420
 being done in order to process 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.819
 frost excess moisture does not evaporate 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.489
 from cardboard cup in cup in 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:34.640
 first did not deteriorate the quality of the product 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:38.880
 secondly so that the freezer does not 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.920
 Kohl frost formed further more 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.590
 one nuance 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.540
 or the question may even be so many 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.750
 there will be why I do not freeze 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.730
 solid fornicator 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:54.079
 I do such a rub firstly I already 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:56.819
 said frozen strawberries 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:02.060
 rubbed with sugar but the new one tastes better 

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:02.060
 secondly it is firstly secondly 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:08.090
 strong strawberry when unfolding 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:11.379
 she tastes so kind 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.330
 Well, I do not even know what to call 

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:18.140
 such a soap that so well , something very 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:22.459
 tasteless in the third basically we 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:24.860
 use this strawberry as a filler 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.010
 for yogurt, article first home 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.349
 yogurt fish will be below this video 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.920
 and in winter 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:36.519
 defreeze a cup of strawberries I 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.140
 add homemade yogurt 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:42.079
 strawberry yogurt and how my whole not 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.299
 deprives great pleasure principle 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.959
 this is how we che I continue to fold here 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:50.120
 it's all strawberries in a one-on-one box 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.840
 so more compact or then how 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.120
 you send back the freezer and wait 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.220
 winters when frosts come when not 

00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:00.349
