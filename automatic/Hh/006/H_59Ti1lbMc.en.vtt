00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 hello everyone, today's topic 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.740
 Primer penetration is dedicated to 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.910
 the reason we all know what we need three 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.590
 rifle more precisely take shake off and take 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.929
 put a brush and put all that 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.680
 please and apply on the undisputed more 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.380
 someone doesnâ€™t feel right away 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.570
 practice began to use and wear but 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 apply first coat 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.990
 the primer itself is broken in a certain 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 proportions dissolve the primer should 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.020
 suddenly proportions 1 1 to the house let that 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.600
 gram 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.540
 cook let's say water service and second 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.450
 the way is 100 grams of primer and 200 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:47.010
 grams of water water gives the best 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:50.430
 penetration of particles and primer molecules 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.440
 in the base itself therefore to primer 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:56.010
 did not accumulate on immediately when 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 applied on the basis of 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.070
 and still penetrated inside by that 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:04.199
 strengthen more your advice you can 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.590
 understand and check that is poll 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:11.010
 and fruits form you once its penetration 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.090
 we will be the minimum but now if you 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:17.700
 dilute and put it there early 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.280
 primer collapsed on is penetrate 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.350
 more deeply after drying already 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.689
 diluted primer on the wall 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.570
 you or you will need on the floor 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.820
 take already so let's say no concentrate 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.150
 diluted primer and apply as 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.479
 you can usually check yourself 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.880
 on my own I will take out the media myself to take 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.759
 two bases 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.710
 how would take a piece flew mortar 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:50.360
 Well, let's say gypsum give them dry 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:54.090
 then apply primer with 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:56.390
 sprayer not diluted primer 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.240
 and such a second reason immediately 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.159
 after his mustache 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.369
 make me the second put the second layer 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.590
 after drying later, let's say two 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.010
 days you can take your cream and 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:15.160
 and see that where it was not diluted 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.250
 primer on the base there is a film of her 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.380
 you can pick up and tear off well 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.569
 layba so drag on optimal work 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.190
 Bukharin and in the primer which is already 

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.500
 it was originally originally 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.970
 diluted first layer and subsequent 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.900
 concentrate ordinary groundwater 100 she 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.900
 penetrated inside 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.750
 Based on the very best and giving 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.330
 strength to the very basis when more in 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.340
 becomes suitable for the finish 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.220
 finishes 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.840
 I do not recommend it I recommend it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.260
 professional manufacturers 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:57.390
 building materials on juice sights 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:03:00.519
 so people brands speak for themselves 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:01.810
 I hope the information was useful to you all 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.590
 good bye 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.590
 take care of yourself
