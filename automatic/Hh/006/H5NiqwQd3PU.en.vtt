going and just put it like that and on

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.960 
going and just put it like that and on
the<00:04:56.320> top<00:04:56.530> I'll<00:04:56.740> just<00:04:56.920> leave<00:04:57.040> it<00:04:57.100> to<00:04:57.250> dry<00:04:57.550> and<00:04:57.880> I

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
the top I'll just leave it to dry and I

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.640 
the top I'll just leave it to dry and I
don't<00:04:58.210> really<00:04:58.330> like<00:04:58.420> leaving<00:04:58.960> clips<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.470> my

00:04:59.640 --> 00:04:59.650 
don't really like leaving clips in my

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.380 
don't really like leaving clips in my
ear<00:04:59.890> while<00:05:00.070> my<00:05:00.340> hair<00:05:00.520> was<00:05:00.670> wrapped<00:05:00.940> in<00:05:01.180> dry

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
ear while my hair was wrapped in dry

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:07.380 
ear while my hair was wrapped in dry
because<00:05:01.570> it<00:05:02.350> tends<00:05:03.040> to<00:05:03.160> leave<00:05:03.670> on<00:05:04.060> a<00:05:05.220> mark<00:05:06.390> so

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
because it tends to leave on a mark so

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:11.310 
because it tends to leave on a mark so
that's<00:05:07.570> why<00:05:07.780> I<00:05:07.810> really<00:05:09.360> leave<00:05:10.360> those<00:05:10.750> in<00:05:10.780> my

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
that's why I really leave those in my

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.100 
that's why I really leave those in my
head<00:05:11.620> I<00:05:11.980> just<00:05:12.580> use<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:12.970> as<00:05:13.120> a<00:05:13.150> guide<00:05:13.390> to<00:05:14.080> help

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110
