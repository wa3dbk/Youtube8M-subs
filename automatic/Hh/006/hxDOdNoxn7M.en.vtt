and<00:01:45.450> usually<00:01:45.929> in<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.080> Latin<00:01:46.349> movements<00:01:46.830> our

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
and usually in the Latin movements our

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.160 
and usually in the Latin movements our
frame<00:01:48.090> will<00:01:48.330> tend<00:01:48.539> to<00:01:48.569> be<00:01:48.690> a<00:01:48.720> little<00:01:48.899> bit<00:01:49.050> more

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
frame will tend to be a little bit more

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.960 
frame will tend to be a little bit more
and<00:01:49.500> compact<00:01:49.920> in<00:01:50.130> here<00:01:50.310> opposed<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.670> being<00:01:50.789> out

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
and compact in here opposed to being out

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.309 
and compact in here opposed to being out
like<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.209> ballrooms<00:01:51.569> onto<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> side

00:01:52.309 --> 00:01:52.319 
like the ballrooms onto the side

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:53.930 
like the ballrooms onto the side
somewhere<00:01:53.039> in<00:01:53.190> that<00:01:53.250> Latin<00:01:53.610> movement

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
somewhere in that Latin movement

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.820 
somewhere in that Latin movement
sometimes<00:01:54.239> you<00:01:54.330> see<00:01:54.450> something<00:01:54.619> arms<00:01:55.619> like

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
sometimes you see something arms like

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.979 
sometimes you see something arms like
this<00:01:56.009> it's<00:01:56.429> your<00:01:56.520> preference<00:01:56.789> so<00:01:57.179> just<00:01:57.840> kind

00:01:57.979 --> 00:01:57.989 
this it's your preference so just kind

00:01:57.989 --> 00:01:59.270 
this it's your preference so just kind
of<00:01:58.020> holding<00:01:58.229> it<00:01:58.319> more<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.770> tight<00:01:59.009> position

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
of holding it more in the tight position

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.529 
of holding it more in the tight position
slow<00:02:00.020> quick<00:02:01.020> we've<00:02:01.229> drawn<00:02:01.470> out<00:02:01.649> that<00:02:01.830> slow

00:02:02.529 --> 00:02:02.539 
slow quick we've drawn out that slow

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:07.219 
slow quick we've drawn out that slow
dragging<00:02:03.539> that<00:02:03.690> foot<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.470> low<00:02:04.640> ok<00:02:05.959> the<00:02:06.959> pattern

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
dragging that foot so low ok the pattern

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.690 
dragging that foot so low ok the pattern
number<00:02:07.410> 2<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.679> a<00:02:07.709> basic<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.369> second

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
number 2 and a basic is the second

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.540 
number 2 and a basic is the second
position<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.750> basically<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.410> is<00:02:11.160> going<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.489> be

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
position so basically is is going to be

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.610 
position so basically is is going to be
a<00:02:11.819> side<00:02:12.300> together<00:02:13.230> side<00:02:14.090> and<00:02:15.090> together<00:02:15.620> so

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
a side together side and together so

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.839 
a side together side and together so
they<00:02:16.799> go<00:02:16.920> quick<00:02:17.519> quick<00:02:18.150> slow<00:02:18.659> quick<00:02:19.340> quick

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849 
they go quick quick slow quick quick

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.020 
they go quick quick slow quick quick
slow<00:02:21.560> quick<00:02:22.560> quick<00:02:22.769> think<00:02:23.370> of<00:02:23.430> it<00:02:23.519> as<00:02:23.700> again

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
slow quick quick think of it as again

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.539 
slow quick quick think of it as again
you're<00:02:24.209> stepping<00:02:24.569> step<00:02:25.439> down<00:02:25.680> step<00:02:26.189> back<00:02:26.489> up

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
you're stepping step down step back up

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.190 
you're stepping step down step back up

up and step down same thing when I go to
the<00:06:33.760> right<00:06:33.880> step<00:06:34.660> down<00:06:34.960> together<00:06:35.410> step<00:06:36.040> down

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:36.370 
the right step down together step down

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:38.730 
the right step down together step down
together<00:06:36.820> step<00:06:37.419> down<00:06:37.720> opposed<00:06:38.440> to<00:06:38.590> stepping

together step down opposed to stepping
out<00:06:39.479> okay<00:06:40.479> so<00:06:40.539> the<00:06:40.690> difference<00:06:40.840> how<00:06:41.080> that

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
out okay so the difference how that

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.140 
out okay so the difference how that
looks<00:06:41.440> so<00:06:42.220> more<00:06:42.460> of<00:06:42.520> the<00:06:42.610> get<00:06:42.760> them<00:06:42.880> you'll<00:06:43.030> get

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
looks so more of the get them you'll get

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.550 
looks so more of the get them you'll get
more<00:06:43.240> of<00:06:43.330> that<00:06:43.390> hip<00:06:43.660> movement<00:06:44.080> then<00:06:44.320> and<00:06:44.470> they
