00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.170
 functional we will also see how it 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.930
 they feel since it is the latest technology

 coming also on a motorcycle and that is going to 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.070
 comment part of this new acquisition

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.100
 will involve this death 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.990
 good morning good the new the new 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.820
 technology that has acquired that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.920
 acquired carabineros de chile as 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.100
 you no longer have to see sayings are 64 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.610
 motorcycles of a larger cylinder are 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.910
 of 700 cubic centimeters 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.900
 and this means that it is a new 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.990
 refinement or a new technology 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.220
 that we the level carabineros 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.340
 first in santiago and some provinces 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.990
 of our country we are going to have 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 this vehicle as I say is more agile 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's better police coverage and good 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.460
 can be driven by both women and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.319
 as men for the benefit of 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.240
 our transit service is now a

 unpublished fact that they are for the staff 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.950
 female highlight these bikes also what 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.750
 we were commenting on safety and also 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.299
 the acceleration capacity 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.880
 because they were decided to deliver this 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:56.219
 kind of instruments to the staff and good 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.649
 the female staff has highlighted a lot 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.890
 in these transit services gives us the 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.209
 trust to be able to give you these 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.920
 tools so important for 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:06.179
 our services and how do I say good 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.459
 in this opportunity we are 

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.289
 perfecting we have our 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.090
 driver's school here in cerrillos 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.700
 which is in charge of a grade officer 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:18.360
 from captain the bichette captain and now 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.549
 We have the great cooperation of the bbc 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.379
 instructors of this brand to be able to 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:23.670
 perfect us more and more in our 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:25.500
 in our delivery to the community 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.670
 perfect let's go out a bit of the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.230
 protocol let's see if we can 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.900
 talk to some of them to see what 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.660
 feel to be able to use these bikes 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.389
 latest technology plus major acceleration 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.609
 security that seems good morning I'm 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:41.700
 lacquered second degree clear as it says 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.260
 you a motorcycle which has many 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.690
 benefits for us as 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:50.010
 institution and at the same time it helps us 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:53.220
 can perform the transit role both 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.690
 in the center as in the route with more 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.940
 security because it has much more 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.709
 technology so we feel good 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:00.540
 happy now they are preparing the 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.480
 they are testing what we are doing 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.519
 instruction and to be able to try to do 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.720
 the best possible we want to know more 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:08.130
 details also of these new 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.230
 instruments and that's also why 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.239
 we meet with manuel urzÃºa the 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.849
 institutional sales manager of the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:17.340
 sells mainly in that they stand out 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:19.109
 these are these new bikes that have 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.260
 come to the female staff good 

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:25.200
 particularly one that a very change 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.569
 strong and the greatest orientation is 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.220
 the security that presents the motorcycle brakes 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:31.079
 abs traction control that allows them 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.110
 clearly drive in the conditions 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.640
 from the city 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.960
 and make more of 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.350
 procedures is a very condition 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:40.940
 innovative within institutions 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:42.500
 particularly because they are motorcycles 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.060
 multipurpose we can walk the 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.020
 street we can go out a little to the ground 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.640
 seeing some trails and also doing 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.280
 other characteristics such as for example 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.710
 an escort but you're telling me something 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.390
 yes yes I wanted to see if you can help us 

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:57.650
 with a question go to one of the things 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.660
 that has always called attention to 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.750
 those who drive motorcycles are the weights 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:04.910
 gross of the motorcycle in the case of this in 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:07.100
 particular what is the approximate weight and 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.230
 from there probably lies in that this 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.690
 if it can be a little more vehicle 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:14.060
 suitable for women who probably do not 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:16.880
 always has the same strength as a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.950
 man to drive a motorbike 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.810
 clear that they followed and here assume from 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.700
 the study asks you mainly 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:24.170
 that what happens with the weight in this 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:26.060
 motorcycle in particular that one of the 

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.130
 conditions generally to choose a 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.350
 motorcycle and that it has been done we see that 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:31.910
 pretty big how much does this bike weigh and 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.040
 if it is also good so that what 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:35.450
 uses for example a woman clearly 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.640
 a great topic when choosing a 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.720
 One motorcycle can take you a lot 

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.800
 Attention the fact that it is a motorbike 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:45.050
 200 kilos but that being a motorcycle of gs 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.180
 that has already 30 years of evolution its 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.410
 balances are perfect and we have 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.270
 proven by means of an arduous 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:51.500
 training that we are from from the 

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.680
 summer training all the healing 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:57.590
 arias therefore is something that they themselves 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.770
 have realized that they can work that 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:03.340
 the subject of weight is not a subject 300 kilos 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:06.020
 209 kilos but they are perfectly 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:08.300
 maneuverable we can see in some 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.480
 exercises that we are doing with the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:14.100
 cones where officials manipulate 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:16.050
 perfectly this amount of kilos 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.270
 how much training time have 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:19.860
 had for when they go out to 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.570
 circulation already went into circulation 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:23.520
 green clamor are already gone 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:25.170
 stars were delivered now 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:27.630
 it depends on the institution when they go out to 

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:30.510
 running the training has been 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:31.980
 We start hard in January and we've been 33 

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:33.540
 months training both the people of 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.560
 santiago as of regions because 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.630
 I understand that they will also do 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.370
 derived to regions these motorcycles will 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960
 be of national presence 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:41.340
 the 64 bikes that we are delivering 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.840
 now you need a workout 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.880
 special for the weight 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.560
 precisely basically the 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.050
 training that an instructor does 

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.720
 Factory-enabled is geared to 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.120
 some tips that allow you to manage 

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.820
 correctly these weights know how to 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.770
 double how to brake how to overtake 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.390
 spend speeds in order are a series 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.820
 of techniques that, as you say, go 

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:05.250
 related to driving optimally 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:07.350
 the weight and being able to work perfect 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:10.830
 perfect good but there we solved 

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:12.900
 then this doubt 209 kilos unthinkable 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.730
 in any case, as what will handle it 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.020
 a woman but we can see them there 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.599
 quite 

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.000
 well driving this this new 

00:06:18.599 --> 00:06:23.190
 instrument of work that then already 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.319
 they would soon be going to circulation 

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:27.870
 there we see part of the instructions with this 

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:29.970
 image we say goodbye without showing this 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:32.220
 unpublished fact as the colonel said 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.020
 Oscar Vargas since it is the first 

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.479
 institution that uses this type of motorcycle 

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:38.430
 for a female staff from europe well 

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:41.009
 thank you very much see for that report 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:42.960
 Well, we need Carabineros for this 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.840
 acquisition that I hope is for the good of 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.310
 the community also for better control 

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.169
 of the transit and we are going to meet again 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:50.550
 we see later by other 

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:52.360
 news thank you very much we're going with 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.840
 that image 

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.840
 equally good morning
