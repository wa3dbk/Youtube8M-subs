00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:12.559
 hello this little video is just 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.140
 to show you how I do my 

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:17.360
 nourishing shampoo today I 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:20.240
 will show you just how I'm doing 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.130
 so this shampoo and I can 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:26.660
 apply it on me when I you 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.869
 show how I do it we go for 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:33.020
 the two ages so it depends on the 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:35.720
 length of your hair the volume of your 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.190
 hair so I really have no 2 to 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.070
 you give it on it so it's you 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.000
 who see it will be in the eye 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:51.050
 so we will start a year 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.859
 I always start by surprise me 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.859
 little 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.460
 for the occasion 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.540
 and then you can put several 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:28.690
 oils so it depends what you have 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:35.020
 so at home you really want to be 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:36.880
 was this passage in hand and especially not 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.420
 not worry that's addresses 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:42.340
 not the hair 20 not even you 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.920
 put oil in a field 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.530
 while after rinsing for 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.229
 oily hair so separate also do you 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.289
 do not worry this oil side of a 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.800
 shampoo it's not going to give you any 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:59.110
 greasy hair in addition not at all 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.610
 if not the application me I always do 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:05.200
 I do a first shampoo 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:07.869
 with that I rinse right after and 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.980
 I make a second choice point there by 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:15.580
 against I leave two to five minutes 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:18.010
 for break time and bicycles 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.379
 better anyway is to find a 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.060
 shampoo without sulfate but it's 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.080
 rather the problem is that if you 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.430
 bought several songs dots with 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.840
 the suspect to send a little thrown 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.330
 it'll make a nice little sore 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.099
 finance quan that if you ever have 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.780
 questions do not hesitate while waiting 

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.010
 so take care of yourself and I will 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.010
 see you soon dad
