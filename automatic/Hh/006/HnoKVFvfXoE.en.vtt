00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.080 

so<00:00:07.470> with<00:00:07.649> trowels<00:00:07.950> you<00:00:08.130> essentially<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.940> have

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
so with trowels you essentially you have

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.700 
so with trowels you essentially you have
you<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.599> three<00:00:09.870> main<00:00:10.080> variables<00:00:10.620> that

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
you have three main variables that

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.039 
you have three main variables that
you're<00:00:10.860> considering<00:00:11.540> in<00:00:12.540> order<00:00:12.780> to<00:00:12.870> figure

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
you're considering in order to figure

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.169 
you're considering in order to figure
out<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.530> the<00:00:13.679> right<00:00:13.860> trail<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.429> for<00:00:14.820> the<00:00:15.000> job

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
out what the right trail is for the job

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.060 
out what the right trail is for the job
that<00:00:15.210> you're<00:00:15.480> trying<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.839> do<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.800> first

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
that you're trying to do the first

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.070 
that you're trying to do the first
variable<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> flexibility<00:00:18.630> or<00:00:18.750> stiffness

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
variable is the flexibility or stiffness

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.840 
variable is the flexibility or stiffness
of<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> trial<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.070> second<00:00:20.400> variable<00:00:20.670> is

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
of the trial the second variable is

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.640 
of the trial the second variable is
whether<00:00:21.180> or<00:00:21.330> not<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.660> material<00:00:22.050> the<00:00:22.380> trowel

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
whether or not the material the trowel

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.130 
whether or not the material the trowel
is<00:00:22.830> made<00:00:23.130> out<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.369> has<00:00:23.820> surface<00:00:24.600> tension<00:00:24.630> with

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
is made out of has surface tension with

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.230 
is made out of has surface tension with
water<00:00:25.439> and<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:26.430> third<00:00:26.640> variable<00:00:26.939> is<00:00:27.090> going<00:00:27.150> to

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
water and the third variable is going to

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.240 
water and the third variable is going to
be<00:00:27.300> size<00:00:29.960> so<00:00:30.960> looking<00:00:31.289> first<00:00:31.500> at<00:00:31.650> stiffness

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
be size so looking first at stiffness

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.680 
be size so looking first at stiffness
you'll<00:00:32.700> notice<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> this<00:00:34.579> float<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.790> solid

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
you'll notice that this float is solid

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.220 
you'll notice that this float is solid
metal<00:00:37.100> but<00:00:38.100> it<00:00:38.280> is<00:00:38.430> I<00:00:39.000> can't<00:00:39.450> bend<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:39.989> can't

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
metal but it is I can't bend it I can't

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
metal but it is I can't bend it I can't
flex<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.770> it's<00:00:41.370> completely<00:00:42.360> rigid<00:00:43.879> versus

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
flex it it's completely rigid versus

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.630 
flex it it's completely rigid versus
this<00:00:45.480> trowel<00:00:45.870> which<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.440> also<00:00:46.800> solid<00:00:47.129> metal

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
this trowel which is also solid metal

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.139 
this trowel which is also solid metal
however<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.649> can<00:00:49.649> bend<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.250> bends<00:00:50.850> pretty

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
however I can bend it it bends pretty

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.100 
however I can bend it it bends pretty
easily<00:00:52.610> so<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.789> difference<00:00:54.149> is<00:00:54.360> when<00:00:55.079> you

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
easily so the difference is when you

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.099 
easily so the difference is when you
have<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> stiff<00:00:55.800> trowel<00:00:56.129> like<00:00:56.160> this<00:00:56.550> one<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:57.660> has

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
have a stiff trowel like this one it has

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.020 
have a stiff trowel like this one it has
to<00:00:58.410> move<00:00:58.590> all<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.160> material<00:00:59.520> that's<00:00:59.670> in<00:00:59.879> its

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
to move all the material that's in its

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.209 
to move all the material that's in its
way<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.539> has<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.170> move<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.559> material<00:01:02.010> out<00:01:02.190> of

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
way it has to move that material out of

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.820 
way it has to move that material out of
its<00:01:02.460> way<00:01:02.640> so<00:01:02.969> it<00:01:03.180> will<00:01:03.210> leave<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.840> with<00:01:04.619> this

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
its way so it will leave you with this

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.480 
its way so it will leave you with this
straight<00:01:05.250> edge<00:01:05.489> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.630> surface<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:08.010> leave

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
straight edge in the surface so leave

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.750 
straight edge in the surface so leave
you<00:01:08.580> with<00:01:08.729> a<00:01:08.760> flat<00:01:09.210> surface<00:01:09.570> the<00:01:10.760> flexible

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
you with a flat surface the flexible

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.359 
you with a flat surface the flexible
trowel<00:01:12.060> because<00:01:12.450> it's<00:01:12.630> flexible<00:01:13.200> has<00:01:14.189> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
trowel because it's flexible has the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.330 
trowel because it's flexible has the
opposite<00:01:14.850> effect<00:01:15.409> the<00:01:16.409> trowel<00:01:16.680> will<00:01:16.890> actually

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
opposite effect the trowel will actually

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.570 
opposite effect the trowel will actually
Bend<00:01:17.700> depending<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.549> front

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
Bend depending on what you have in front

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.960 
Bend depending on what you have in front
of<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.000> and<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.320> will<00:01:22.530> adjust<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.549> the

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
of it and so it will adjust to the

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.800 
of it and so it will adjust to the
surface<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:24.540> existing<00:01:25.170> on<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.409> wall<00:01:26.810> so

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
surface that's existing on the wall so

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.630 
surface that's existing on the wall so
instead<00:01:28.409> of<00:01:28.530> moving<00:01:28.740> all<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.130> material<00:01:29.520> out

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
instead of moving all the material out

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.630 
instead of moving all the material out
of<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:29.850> way<00:01:30.030> and<00:01:30.329> creating<00:01:30.750> a<00:01:30.810> very<00:01:30.990> flat<00:01:31.640> wall

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
of the way and creating a very flat wall

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.539 
of the way and creating a very flat wall
you<00:01:33.479> create<00:01:33.869> a<00:01:33.900> very<00:01:34.079> smooth<00:01:34.560> looking<00:01:35.070> wall<00:01:35.280> so

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
you create a very smooth looking wall so

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
you create a very smooth looking wall so
if<00:01:35.640> you<00:01:35.729> haven't<00:01:35.909> already<00:01:36.119> shaped<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:36.780> you

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
if you haven't already shaped it and you

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.539 
if you haven't already shaped it and you
go<00:01:37.170> right<00:01:37.380> in<00:01:37.530> with<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.740> flexible<00:01:38.159> trowel

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
go right in with a flexible trowel

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
go right in with a flexible trowel
you're<00:01:39.479> not<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> really<00:01:40.020> be<00:01:40.140> able<00:01:40.320> to

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
you're not going to really be able to

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.179 
you're not going to really be able to
shape<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.600> flexible<00:01:43.290> trowel<00:01:43.590> is<00:01:43.890> better

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
shape it so a flexible trowel is better

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.660 
shape it so a flexible trowel is better
for<00:01:44.670> crazy<00:01:45.299> curvy<00:01:45.810> things<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.549> when<00:01:47.549> you're

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
for crazy curvy things and when you're

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.980 
for crazy curvy things and when you're
trying<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:47.970> take<00:01:48.270> out<00:01:49.520> trowel<00:01:50.520> marks<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.090> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
trying to take out trowel marks and a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.840 
trying to take out trowel marks and a
stiff<00:01:52.439> trowel<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:53.040> when<00:01:53.490> you're<00:01:53.610> trying<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
stiff trowel is when you're trying to

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.490 
stiff trowel is when you're trying to
move<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.240> material<00:01:54.390> around<00:01:54.930> and<00:01:55.259> try<00:01:55.439> to

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
move the material around and try to

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.440 
move the material around and try to
shape<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.100> to<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.340> specific<00:01:56.549> shape<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:57.329> you're

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
shape it to a specific shape so you're

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.149 
shape it to a specific shape so you're
trying<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.689> make<00:01:57.780> a<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:58.140> level<00:01:58.560> floor<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
trying to make a really level floor and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.219 
trying to make a really level floor and
you<00:01:59.250> don't<00:01:59.460> want<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.700> see<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.119> the<00:02:00.299> movements

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
you don't want to see all the movements

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.590 
you don't want to see all the movements
from<00:02:01.380> your<00:02:01.560> hand<00:02:01.799> you<00:02:02.759> want<00:02:02.909> to<00:02:03.060> use<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.240> really

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
from your hand you want to use a really

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.510 
from your hand you want to use a really
stiff<00:02:03.869> trowel<00:02:06.590> the<00:02:07.590> second<00:02:07.950> variable<00:02:08.220> is

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
stiff trowel the second variable is

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
trowel is and specifically or you're

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.940 
trowel is and specifically or you're
concerned<00:02:12.569> about<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.989> property<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.530> surface

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
concerned about the property of surface

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.850 
concerned about the property of surface
tension<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.430> water<00:02:14.670> to<00:02:15.030> that<00:02:15.209> material<00:02:15.860> for

tension of water to that material for

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:23.059 
tension of water to that material for
example<00:02:17.370> a<00:02:17.610> steel<00:02:18.269> float<00:02:19.700> when<00:02:20.700> you<00:02:22.040> run<00:02:23.040> a

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
example a steel float when you run a

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:25.850 
example a steel float when you run a
steel<00:02:23.430> float<00:02:23.730> across<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.120> floor<00:02:24.860> there's

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
steel float across a floor there's

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
steel float across a floor there's
actually<00:02:26.780> an<00:02:28.310> attraction<00:02:29.310> between<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:30.510> water

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
actually an attraction between the water

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.350 
actually an attraction between the water
that's<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.410> your<00:02:31.620> material<00:02:32.220> to<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:33.000> steel<00:02:33.330> of

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
that's in your material to the steel of

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.520 
that's in your material to the steel of
the<00:02:33.810> trowel<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.700> it<00:02:35.700> will<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.780> trowel<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.410> you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
the trowel and it will the trowel as you

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.860 
the trowel and it will the trowel as you
run<00:02:37.830> it<00:02:37.860> over<00:02:38.250> the<00:02:38.340> floor<00:02:38.700> will<00:02:39.060> pull<00:02:39.510> the

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
run it over the floor will pull the

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.500 
run it over the floor will pull the
water<00:02:40.049> up<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.980> trowel<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.459> with<00:02:42.269> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
water up to the trowel and with that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.570 
water up to the trowel and with that
water<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.989> pulls<00:02:43.140> a<00:02:43.260> little<00:02:43.500> bit<00:02:43.620> of<00:02:43.709> clay<00:02:43.980> from

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
water it pulls a little bit of clay from

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.600 
water it pulls a little bit of clay from
your<00:02:44.730> floor<00:02:45.000> into<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.629> trowel<00:02:46.310> which<00:02:47.310> lets

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
your floor into that trowel which lets

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.199 
your floor into that trowel which lets
you<00:02:47.819> then<00:02:48.030> sweep<00:02:48.959> across<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.500> floor<00:02:49.830> with<00:02:50.209> a

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
you then sweep across the floor with a

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.750 
you then sweep across the floor with a
little<00:02:51.660> tiny<00:02:51.900> skim<00:02:52.319> of<00:02:52.470> clay<00:02:52.709> which<00:02:53.370> lets<00:02:53.640> you

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
little tiny skim of clay which lets you

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.850 
little tiny skim of clay which lets you
make<00:02:53.849> the<00:02:54.000> floor<00:02:54.209> really<00:02:54.480> smooth<00:02:54.780> that's<00:02:55.410> also

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
make the floor really smooth that's also

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.160 
make the floor really smooth that's also
true<00:02:55.920> for<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.519> flexible<00:02:56.970> trowel<00:02:57.239> so<00:02:57.810> this<00:02:58.049> is

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
true for the flexible trowel so this is

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.080 
true for the flexible trowel so this is
also<00:02:58.380> steel<00:02:58.829> it<00:02:59.010> has<00:02:59.040> good<00:02:59.340> surface<00:02:59.730> tension

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
also steel it has good surface tension

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.300 
also steel it has good surface tension
with<00:03:00.239> the<00:03:00.269> water<00:03:00.540> in<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:00.900> floor<00:03:01.290> and<00:03:01.560> as<00:03:02.160> you

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
with the water in the floor and as you

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.069 
with the water in the floor and as you
run<00:03:02.459> over<00:03:02.760> it's<00:03:02.880> going<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.120> make<00:03:03.269> the<00:03:03.450> surface

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:04.079 
run over it's going to make the surface

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:07.250 
run over it's going to make the surface
feel<00:03:04.440> really<00:03:04.739> smooth<00:03:05.390> the<00:03:06.390> wooden<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:06.989> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
feel really smooth the wooden and the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.650 
feel really smooth the wooden and the
magnesium<00:03:07.680> floats<00:03:08.250> do<00:03:08.640> not<00:03:08.970> have<00:03:09.269> surface

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
magnesium floats do not have surface

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.259 
magnesium floats do not have surface
tension<00:03:10.019> with<00:03:10.170> water<00:03:10.410> so<00:03:11.190> when<00:03:11.400> you<00:03:11.640> run

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
tension with water so when you run

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:16.670 
tension with water so when you run
across<00:03:12.540> a<00:03:13.230> floor<00:03:13.799> for<00:03:14.069> a<00:03:14.190> plaster<00:03:14.970> wall<00:03:15.680> they

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
across a floor for a plaster wall they

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:18.050 
across a floor for a plaster wall they
will<00:03:16.860> move<00:03:17.040> again<00:03:17.430> they're<00:03:17.579> not<00:03:17.610> they're

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
will move again they're not they're

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.640 
will move again they're not they're
stiff<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:18.569> they<00:03:18.720> will<00:03:18.870> move<00:03:19.049> the<00:03:19.200> material<00:03:19.319> out

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
stiff so they will move the material out

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.690 
stiff so they will move the material out
of<00:03:19.680> your<00:03:19.859> way<00:03:19.950> and<00:03:21.889> they<00:03:22.889> will<00:03:23.069> not<00:03:23.340> pull

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
of your way and they will not pull

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.330 
of your way and they will not pull
moisture<00:03:24.239> to<00:03:24.569> the<00:03:24.690> top<00:03:24.900> so<00:03:25.290> they<00:03:25.470> will<00:03:25.680> if<00:03:25.950> you

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
moisture to the top so they will if you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.039 
moisture to the top so they will if you
go<00:03:26.459> over<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.000> over<00:03:27.090> and<00:03:27.389> over<00:03:27.450> and<00:03:27.750> over<00:03:27.959> and

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
go over and over and over and over and

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:29.750 
go over and over and over and over and
over<00:03:28.139> with<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.530> magnesium<00:03:28.950> floater<00:03:29.400> a<00:03:29.489> wooden

then our third variable is size and
you'll<00:03:55.019> notice<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.799> know<00:03:55.889> there's<00:03:56.130> a<00:03:56.190> variety

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
you'll notice you know there's a variety

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.349 
you'll notice you know there's a variety
of<00:03:57.359> sizes<00:03:57.599> that<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:58.109> use<00:03:58.440> here<00:03:58.849> the<00:03:59.849> idea<00:04:00.150> behind

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
of sizes that I use here the idea behind

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.879 
of sizes that I use here the idea behind
size<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.989> that<00:04:01.109> when<00:04:01.260> you're<00:04:01.380> pushing<00:04:01.739> on<00:04:01.829> a

size is that when you're pushing on a

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:05.839 
size is that when you're pushing on a
trowel<00:04:02.190> right<00:04:02.670> and<00:04:03.349> then<00:04:04.349> you're<00:04:04.530> moving<00:04:04.920> you

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
trowel right and then you're moving you

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.280 
trowel right and then you're moving you
don't<00:04:05.970> have<00:04:06.209> exactly<00:04:06.959> the<00:04:07.200> same<00:04:07.340> even<00:04:08.340> force

the entire time that you're working the
trial<00:04:12.120> there's<00:04:12.359> like<00:04:12.540> slight<00:04:12.989> imperfections

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
trial there's like slight imperfections

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.339 
trial there's like slight imperfections
in<00:04:14.160> how<00:04:15.000> you're<00:04:15.299> pushing<00:04:15.660> on<00:04:15.720> the<00:04:15.870> trowel<00:04:16.079> and

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
in how you're pushing on the trowel and

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.400 
in how you're pushing on the trowel and
the<00:04:17.190> larger<00:04:17.700> your<00:04:17.849> surface<00:04:18.359> area<00:04:18.720> of<00:04:18.900> the

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 
the larger your surface area of the

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.310 
the larger your surface area of the
trowel<00:04:19.650> face<00:04:20.239> the<00:04:21.239> larger<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.810> area<00:04:21.840> those

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
trowel face the larger the area those

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.890 
trowel face the larger the area those
imperfections<00:04:23.130> are<00:04:23.310> spread<00:04:23.669> across<00:04:23.940> and<00:04:24.419> so

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:24.900 
imperfections are spread across and so

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.560 
imperfections are spread across and so
they<00:04:25.140> will<00:04:25.320> appear<00:04:25.890> smaller<00:04:26.849> in<00:04:27.150> your

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
they will appear smaller in your

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.050 
they will appear smaller in your
so<00:04:28.200> if<00:04:28.440> you<00:04:28.680> especially<00:04:29.430> if<00:04:29.640> your<00:04:29.760> first

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
so if you especially if your first

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.420 
so if you especially if your first
trying<00:04:30.390> to<00:04:30.450> use<00:04:30.690> a<00:04:30.720> trowel<00:04:31.280> there's<00:04:32.280> an

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
trying to use a trowel there's an

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.490 
trying to use a trowel there's an
awkwardness<00:04:32.880> to<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> large<00:04:33.480> trowel<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:34.320> it

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:34.500 
awkwardness to a large trowel but it

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:39.560 
awkwardness to a large trowel but it
also<00:04:34.740> lets<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:37.400> be<00:04:38.400> slightly<00:04:38.700> inconsistent

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:39.570 
also lets you be slightly inconsistent

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:41.720 
also lets you be slightly inconsistent
with<00:04:39.720> how<00:04:39.870> you<00:04:39.930> move<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.500> trowel<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.130> it's

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
with how you move the trowel and it's

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:43.580 
with how you move the trowel and it's
distributing<00:04:42.300> that<00:04:42.420> inconsistency<00:04:43.350> over<00:04:43.560> a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
distributing that inconsistency over a

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.320 
distributing that inconsistency over a
much<00:04:43.770> larger<00:04:43.950> area<00:04:44.160> so<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.640> don't<00:04:44.790> see<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.210> as

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
much larger area so you don't see it as

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.290 
much larger area so you don't see it as
much<00:04:45.510> in<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:45.750> wall<00:04:46.520> the<00:04:47.520> benefit<00:04:47.910> of<00:04:47.940> a<00:04:48.090> very

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:48.300 
much in the wall the benefit of a very

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:50.180 
much in the wall the benefit of a very
small<00:04:48.630> trowel<00:04:48.960> and<00:04:49.260> these<00:04:49.410> are<00:04:49.590> now<00:04:49.740> so<00:04:50.070> these

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:50.190 
small trowel and these are now so these

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.500 
small trowel and these are now so these
have<00:04:50.340> high<00:04:50.550> surface<00:04:50.850> tension<00:04:51.000> because

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:51.510 
have high surface tension because

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.060 
have high surface tension because
they're<00:04:51.690> super<00:04:51.900> beautiful<00:04:52.410> stainless<00:04:52.710> steel

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
they're super beautiful stainless steel

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.750 
they're super beautiful stainless steel
they're<00:04:53.640> extremely<00:04:54.540> flexible<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:56.400> they<00:04:56.580> will

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
they're extremely flexible so they will

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.340 
they're extremely flexible so they will
let<00:04:56.910> you<00:04:57.030> do<00:04:57.180> lots<00:04:57.450> of<00:04:57.630> detail<00:04:58.020> work<00:04:58.230> and

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350 
let you do lots of detail work and

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.860 
let you do lots of detail work and
they're<00:04:58.680> teeny<00:04:58.920> teeny<00:04:59.220> teeny<00:04:59.520> tiny<00:04:59.910> so<00:05:00.690> they

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
they're teeny teeny teeny tiny so they

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.780 
they're teeny teeny teeny tiny so they
let<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.170> get<00:05:01.380> in<00:05:01.500> little<00:05:01.800> teeny<00:05:02.040> tight<00:05:02.310> areas

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
let you get in little teeny tight areas

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.690 
let you get in little teeny tight areas
if<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.960> tried<00:05:04.350> to<00:05:04.470> plaster<00:05:04.920> an<00:05:05.010> entire<00:05:05.370> wall

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:05.700 
if you tried to plaster an entire wall

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.960 
if you tried to plaster an entire wall
with<00:05:05.730> these<00:05:06.120> little<00:05:06.600> teeny<00:05:06.810> tiny<00:05:06.960> trials<00:05:07.970> you

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 
with these little teeny tiny trials you

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.420 
with these little teeny tiny trials you
would<00:05:09.270> see<00:05:09.540> every<00:05:09.930> single<00:05:10.110> mark<00:05:10.500> from<00:05:11.070> every

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
would see every single mark from every

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.280 
would see every single mark from every
single<00:05:11.640> stroke<00:05:12.060> that<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.570> go<00:05:12.720> across<00:05:13.020> the

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
single stroke that you go across the

single stroke that you go across the
wall<00:05:13.500> with<00:05:14.690> but<00:05:15.690> these<00:05:15.840> benefit<00:05:16.350> you<00:05:16.530> when

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
wall with but these benefit you when

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:17.870 
wall with but these benefit you when
you're<00:05:16.860> trying<00:05:17.010> to<00:05:17.190> do<00:05:17.310> like<00:05:17.610> a<00:05:17.640> really

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:17.880 
you're trying to do like a really

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.730 
you're trying to do like a really
detailed<00:05:18.360> area<00:05:18.690> or<00:05:18.840> a<00:05:18.870> niche<00:05:19.200> or<00:05:19.410> something

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
detailed area or a niche or something

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:21.110 
detailed area or a niche or something
like<00:05:19.890> that<00:05:20.100> where<00:05:20.310> you<00:05:20.400> can<00:05:20.520> just<00:05:20.730> get<00:05:20.970> in

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
like that where you can just get in

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.880 
like that where you can just get in
there<00:05:21.270> really<00:05:21.510> lightly<00:05:21.870> and<00:05:22.260> just<00:05:22.530> really
