00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:17.570
 there are several methods of pausing 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.759
 we close open or in between these for 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.500
 extend roof performance ico 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.110
 strongly suggests metal undone 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.970
 open complete laying of under layer 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.340
 and of this one of us before putting the 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.320
 shingles it is recommended to use 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.410
 floors is in galvanized gauge metal 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:37.540
 28 or other anticorrosive material 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.530
 not knowing local codes 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:41.510
 center and a membrane strip 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.420
 protective against water and ice 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.629
 91 cm in the new nail she has 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.309
 tentatively along a border 

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:53.149
 carefully remove the film and 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:54.920
 kolelas by smoothing the folds start at 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:56.000
 from the front roof by causing 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.059
 overlap additional pieces 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.359
 at least 15 centimeters and then remove 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.149
 center nails and a floor is metal 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.640
 pre-finished or galvanized 28 gauge 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.399
 minimum and a minimum width of 60 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.320
 cm in the valley is nailed to the 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:17.899
 borders only to keep it in 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:20.000
 place overlaps each piece 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.369
 metal of at least 15 centimeters and 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.569
 use asphalt paste 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:28.520
 for each section prat these two lines 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:31.190
 distanced by 15 cm at the top 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.259
 7 5 centimeters on either side of the 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.970
 knots with a chalk coated to create 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.020
 all along the valley and increase the 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.800
 distance of 0.3 cm to each 30 cm to 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.450
 down to a maximum of 20 cm place 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.849
 the shingles over the ground one of 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.530
 we carve the bowling done with the 

00:01:46.849 --> 00:01:50.330
 string and nail the shingles to at 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.599
 least five centimeters from the line of 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:55.550
 chalk cut a triangle 5 cm from the corner 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:57.349
 higher so that the water goes in 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.970
 the valley is drowned shock bardot at the 

00:01:57.349 --> 00:02:00.590
 junction of the valley in a band of 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.220
 eight centimeters of pasty coating 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.220
 bituminous
