those are those are a little better they

need<00:02:45.700> to<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.150> taste<00:02:46.569> cuz<00:02:46.930> i<00:02:47.019> know<00:02:47.079> i<00:02:47.200> know

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
need to up the taste cuz i know i know

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.839 
need to up the taste cuz i know i know
this<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.920> needs<00:02:48.160> sugar<00:02:48.310> and<00:02:48.579> if<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.700> had<00:02:48.819> a

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
this is needs sugar and if you had a

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:51.119 
this is needs sugar and if you had a
sugar<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.299> might<00:02:49.510> be<00:02:49.690> passable<00:02:50.140> but<00:02:50.739> my<00:02:50.890> theory

00:02:51.119 --> 00:02:51.129 
sugar it might be passable but my theory

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:52.949 
sugar it might be passable but my theory
on<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.370> is<00:02:51.819> if<00:02:52.030> you<00:02:52.120> have<00:02:52.150> to<00:02:52.390> add<00:02:52.510> something

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
on that is if you have to add something

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.080 
on that is if you have to add something
to<00:02:53.110> cereal<00:02:53.590> what's<00:02:53.920> what's<00:02:54.250> the<00:02:54.340> point<00:02:54.760> it's<00:02:54.970> a

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090
