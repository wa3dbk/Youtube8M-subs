about<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.140> month<00:00:40.379> after<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.739> originally<00:00:41.129> built

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
about a month after I originally built

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.180 
about a month after I originally built
it<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> year<00:00:41.820> ago<00:00:41.879> you<00:00:42.660> know<00:00:43.190> unexpectedly

it a year ago you know unexpectedly

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.310 
it a year ago you know unexpectedly
fried<00:00:44.670> on<00:00:44.879> me<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.239> just<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.660> mr<00:00:45.870> board<00:00:46.079> just

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
fried on me and just the mr board just

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.069 
fried on me and just the mr board just
would<00:00:46.590> not<00:00:46.770> work<00:00:47.100> anymore<00:00:47.510> even<00:00:48.510> though<00:00:48.660> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
would not work anymore even though the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.869 
would not work anymore even though the
battery<00:00:49.379> pack<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.739> charging<00:00:50.280> and<00:00:50.579> getting

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
battery pack was charging and getting

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.049 
battery pack was charging and getting
magic<00:00:51.210> smoke<00:00:51.329> whatever<00:00:52.160> so<00:00:53.160> basically<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:53.940> was

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
magic smoke whatever so basically it was

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.330 
magic smoke whatever so basically it was
my<00:00:54.210> impetus<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.960> break<00:00:55.559> apart<00:00:55.680> and

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
my impetus to break apart and

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.550 
my impetus to break apart and
basically<00:00:58.270> I'm<00:00:58.330> redoing<00:00:58.690> the<00:00:58.900> whole<00:00:59.080> darn

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
basically I'm redoing the whole darn

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.730 
basically I'm redoing the whole darn
thing<00:00:59.650> and<00:01:00.930> there's<00:01:01.930> very<00:01:02.200> few<00:01:02.290> components

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:02.740 
thing and there's very few components

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.619 
thing and there's very few components
that<00:01:03.100> are<00:01:03.160> going<00:01:03.610> to<00:01:03.700> stay<00:01:03.910> the<00:01:04.030> same<00:01:04.239> in<00:01:04.449> this

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
that are going to stay the same in this

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.440 
that are going to stay the same in this
so<00:01:05.470> here<00:01:05.920> I'm<00:01:06.070> just<00:01:06.100> going<00:01:06.280> to<00:01:06.400> show<00:01:06.610> you<00:01:06.670> what

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
so here I'm just going to show you what

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.570 
so here I'm just going to show you what
some<00:01:07.630> of<00:01:07.780> the<00:01:07.900> major<00:01:08.020> differences<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:09.010> I'm

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
some of the major differences and I'm

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.250 
some of the major differences and I'm
stepping<00:01:10.150> this<00:01:10.270> up<00:01:10.450> a<00:01:10.540> notch<00:01:10.720> it's<00:01:11.050> going<00:01:11.200> to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
stepping this up a notch it's going to

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:12.660 
stepping this up a notch it's going to
be<00:01:11.350> beautiful<00:01:11.470> i'm<00:01:11.830> going<00:01:12.010> to<00:01:12.070> hide<00:01:12.220> all<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
be beautiful i'm going to hide all the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.080 
be beautiful i'm going to hide all the
wires<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.650> i'm<00:01:14.650> switching<00:01:15.190> the<00:01:15.369> LED<00:01:15.700> it's<00:01:15.940> no

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
wires and i'm switching the LED it's no

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.580 
wires and i'm switching the LED it's no
longer<00:01:16.270> going<00:01:16.450> to<00:01:16.510> be<00:01:16.570> a<00:01:16.630> blue<00:01:16.869> one<00:01:17.050> it's<00:01:17.380> going

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
longer going to be a blue one it's going

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.130 
longer going to be a blue one it's going
to<00:01:17.740> be<00:01:17.860> a<00:01:17.890> CLP<00:01:18.340> 4<00:01:18.880> i'm<00:01:19.510> going<00:01:19.690> to<00:01:19.750> use<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.869> yellow

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
to be a CLP 4 i'm going to use a yellow

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.980 
to be a CLP 4 i'm going to use a yellow
filter<00:01:20.380> because<00:01:20.770> it'll<00:01:21.550> give<00:01:21.880> a<00:01:22.090> super<00:01:22.600> bright

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
filter because it'll give a super bright

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.430 
filter because it'll give a super bright
yellow<00:01:23.500> it's<00:01:23.950> even<00:01:24.190> better<00:01:24.340> than<00:01:24.460> the<00:01:24.610> amber

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
yellow it's even better than the amber

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.480 
yellow it's even better than the amber
so<00:01:26.550> here<00:01:27.550> is<00:01:27.900> going<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:29.020> be<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.680> blade<00:01:30.070> holder

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
so here is going to be the blade holder

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.460 
so here is going to be the blade holder
and<00:01:30.780> heatsink<00:01:32.550> I<00:01:33.550> don't<00:01:34.540> have<00:01:34.630> epoxy<00:01:35.140> with<00:01:35.290> me

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
and heatsink I don't have epoxy with me

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.440 
and heatsink I don't have epoxy with me
but<00:01:35.680> when<00:01:35.830> I<00:01:35.860> get<00:01:36.070> it<00:01:36.190> when<00:01:36.640> I<00:01:36.700> get<00:01:36.790> it<00:01:37.030> right<00:01:37.180> it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
but when I get it when I get it right it

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.150 
but when I get it when I get it right it
is<00:01:37.600> going<00:01:37.899> to<00:01:37.960> be<00:01:37.990> a<00:01:38.080> proxy<00:01:38.530> together<00:01:38.890> it's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
is going to be a proxy together it's

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.420 
is going to be a proxy together it's
just<00:01:39.430> a<00:01:39.550> simple<00:01:39.910> piece<00:01:40.720> of<00:01:40.750> 1.25<00:01:41.649> aluminum

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
just a simple piece of 1.25 aluminum

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:44.999 
just a simple piece of 1.25 aluminum
tubing<00:01:42.790> that<00:01:43.210> has<00:01:43.420> an<00:01:43.540> inner<00:01:43.690> diameter<00:01:44.259> of<00:01:44.290> 1

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:45.009 
tubing that has an inner diameter of 1

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:47.670 
tubing that has an inner diameter of 1
inch<00:01:45.190> so<00:01:45.580> to<00:01:45.640> hold<00:01:45.850> my<00:01:45.940> blade<00:01:46.180> and<00:01:46.960> heatsink<00:01:47.500> is

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
inch so to hold my blade and heatsink is

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.109 
inch so to hold my blade and heatsink is
again<00:01:48.009> the<00:01:48.040> same<00:01:48.399> one<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.640> I<00:01:48.789> used<00:01:49.030> before

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
again the same one that I used before

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.120

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
that was made by acer market for me on

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.359 
that was made by acer market for me on
custom<00:01:51.610> and<00:01:52.119> as<00:01:52.479> you<00:01:52.630> can<00:01:52.750> see<00:01:53.190> polished<00:01:54.190> up

and<00:01:54.640> its<00:01:54.759> really<00:01:55.030> beautiful<00:01:55.630> looking

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and its really beautiful looking

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.520 
and its really beautiful looking
and<00:01:57.659> then<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:59.299> main<00:02:00.299> part<00:02:00.749> of<00:02:00.899> the<00:02:01.020> hilt<00:02:01.200> here

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and then the main part of the hilt here

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:07.459 
and then the main part of the hilt here
is<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:04.710> clear<00:02:04.950> too<00:02:05.539> now<00:02:06.539> when<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:06.960> was<00:02:07.079> screwing

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
is the clear too now when I was screwing

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:14.630 
is the clear too now when I was screwing
around<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:08.929> notice<00:02:09.929> them<00:02:10.229> cap<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:11.370> a<00:02:11.400> brass<00:02:13.640> sink

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
around I notice them cap to a brass sink

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.420 
around I notice them cap to a brass sink
tube<00:02:15.090> actually<00:02:15.870> kind<00:02:16.290> of<00:02:16.349> fits<00:02:16.590> rather<00:02:17.099> nicely

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
tube actually kind of fits rather nicely

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.940 
tube actually kind of fits rather nicely
on<00:02:17.819> the<00:02:17.849> end<00:02:18.120> there<00:02:18.269> so<00:02:19.170> i<00:02:19.230> think<00:02:19.379> i'm<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.830> to

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
on the end there so i think i'm going to

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.759 
on the end there so i think i'm going to
get<00:02:20.099> another<00:02:20.930> another<00:02:21.930> one<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.349> go<00:02:22.500> on<00:02:22.620> this

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:22.769 
get another another one to go on this

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:25.970 
get another another one to go on this
end<00:02:23.099> and<00:02:23.780> i<00:02:24.780> shall<00:02:25.080> have<00:02:25.230> two<00:02:25.560> of<00:02:25.680> these<00:02:25.769> on

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
end and i shall have two of these on

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.880 
end and i shall have two of these on
each<00:02:26.129> end<00:02:26.370> it'll<00:02:26.610> be<00:02:26.849> it<00:02:27.510> may<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.470> only

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
each end it'll be it may be the only

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.080 
each end it'll be it may be the only
