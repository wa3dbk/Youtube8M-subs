Hi everyone ! This is Kelyrin from Kelyrin-Bento.
Today I have a super cute tutorial for you,

00:00:05.149 --> 00:00:11.349
I'm going to show you 3 ways of making heart-shaped
food for your Bento. So I'll be teaching you

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.660
how to make heart shaped sausages, if you're
vegan you can use vegan sausages, so it works

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:23.240
too, heart shaped tamagoyaki, and finally,
heart shaped tomato. So keep watching if you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.780
want to know how to make these, let's go in
the kitchen ! 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.379
The first thing you need to do, is put your sausage in boiling water and
let it cook for a few minutes. We're going

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.170
to use the ends of the sausages to make the
heart so you will need as many sausages as

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.679
you need hearts. For the sausage heart I'm
going to use a knife, you can try cutting

00:00:44.679 --> 00:00:49.809
with your knife in the middle to see if your
knife suits well. So here I can see that the

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.379
cut is pretty precise, so I'm going to use
that knife for my recipe. If you're a vegetarian

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.589
or a vegan, you can also use a vegan sausage
of course. So the thing now, is to cut diagonally

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:09.509
on each side. Here you go, so you have a diagonal
cut here, and I'm going to do the same thing

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.370
on the other side. It's easier if you have
small sausages because you only need one cut,

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.440
and the sausage will be separated in two.
But if it's a big one, you need two cuts.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.110
And you need to make them approximately the
same size. I'm cutting the edges too because

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.780
they're coming out and it's not really pretty.
And the final step, sticking them to each

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.610
other. So we're going to use a spaghetti pasta,
you need to hold them like this and see how

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.480
long you need the pasta to be, it's going
to be our structure inside. But don't worry,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:50.380
with the moisture it will soften and it won't
be hard to chew on. So I'm just using the

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:58.580
pasta to attach my two pieces, and then they
will stay together. Here you go ! Cute little

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.660
heart. This side is prettier. And you can
stick it in your bento. 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.660
This is the second tutorial. You're going to need tamagoyaki,
which is japanese rolled omelet, so here you

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.810
can see it's already cut into the tamagoyaki
shape, so all you have to do is, same for

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:25.890
the sausage, cut diagonally, then you flip
the other side, and you get a heart ! Now

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.920
we can cut the excess here because it's not
really pretty. And the heart is better looking

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.230
now. So what I used to do, is place them straight
light this in my bento box, but they didn't

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.090
stick together and it's not so pretty, and
one day I found that I still had some egg

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.450
mixture in my bowl so I tried something. I
actually brushed the egg mixture on the heart,

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.300
and then I cooked it for a few minutes on
a pan on a very low heat so that it doesn't

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.500
take any color, and this will actually help
to seal the two pieces together.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.580
Now let's get onto our last project. So here is a cherry
tomato, I like to buy them a bit longer because

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.110
I think it makes prettier hearts, and then
you're going to figure out the roundest part

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.980
of the tomato. So here, it's this side. So
this side is not the roundest part, and I'm

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:21.600
going to cut diagonally here, and we're left
with this half tomato. So now we're going

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:30.689
to put it cut side on the plate, and cut it
in half again. And you're left with two pieces,

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:35.590
all you have to do is assemble them, and you're
left with a heart ! I'll show you again : this

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:40.030
is the roundest part. Sometimes it will be
the side of the stem, sometimes it won't.

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:57.489
Yay ! This one looks really pretty ! So I
can put it as it in my bento or I can secure

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.239
them with a toothpick so that it holds better
! What looks very nice and I love to do is

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:09.099
using mini mozzarella balls, so you put one
ball of mozzarella, one tomato heart in the

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.480
middle, and then another ball of mozzarella.
It looks really adorable in a bento and everyone

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.800
knows that mozzarella and tomatoes go really
well together. 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:27.290
