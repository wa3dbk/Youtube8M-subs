00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.190
 more video of gta iv with line we are 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.690
 here in a death game and we're going to 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 do a all against me but this time 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.929
 somewhat different I suppose this already 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.580
 You will have seen many of them in the background 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.070
 some video of my channel but it's 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.529
 totally oceans that is different but 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.150
 I'm going to record the like and well 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.010
 not knowing knows how to do this because I 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.330
 I explain basically all the people who 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.279
 is here is going to ride on what's coming 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.990
 to be the trucks and I'm going to go for 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.820
 a motorcycle that is there at the bottom of the map 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.680
 and then I have to resist 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.029
 four and a half minutes worth as bg down 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.309
 to the right of the counter four minutes 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.570
 and peak because I have to resist the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.829
 Saying changes can not pull me out 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.870
 the motorcycle during those four minutes if 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.059
 they throw me because they win and if I stay 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.219
 without being thrown away when I and my mother 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 My boy, who passed 50 kilometers very 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.989
 guys let's get the bike okay I have 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.820
 to resist four minutes and ten 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.980
 seconds so 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.540
 will be difficult will have to be invited 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:58.000
 many people invited to kobe ​​and 678 ones 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.680
 how many I can not even count on 18 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.570
 people who just not invited to 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.940
 everyone that I had since others if 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.710
 it would not be impossible since they are only 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:10.440
 four minutes what you want to exist like that 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.440
 that we go there is worth to see if it comes out already 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.380
 That 's how we got married, everybody. 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.170
 the writer changes and all my uncles 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.580
 worth worth worth worth worth watching 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.289
 panoramic from here above me the 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.610
 Towns trucks in summer are many 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.100
 I think there are some left behind 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.990
 and good if you cool because I will bring the same 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:39.880
 but with more people it's worth as I say look 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:42.310
 Look what came out of him worth worth worth and 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.549
 now laborious here there is champion 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.360
 one last one in front different and there 

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.009
 we're 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.229
 voucher voucher voucher voucher at least we are 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:51.399
 resisting a bit more the rules are 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.259
 that we can not open here from this 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.490
 airport because if I start running 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.409
 all over the map already so they do not catch me 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.450
 from braskem now we have this mode of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.729
 game 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.869
 I'm going to do like the one that goes around here and 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.180
 champions 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.360
 here there are champions and I jump you up 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.399
 come on father again divide these 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.080
 so many lost uncles evade worth 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.599
 of the track ocean guys two minutes 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:15.200
 50 seconds we have to resist let's 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.960
 let's go 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:21.870
 around here on the left because the 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:25.040
 trucks okay let's go let's go let's go 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.040
 let's go all good 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.580
 boy has appeared like a wave when 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.720
 since when you surf and a wave passes 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.480
 it appears the same as if I had 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.950
 surfing by a wave of trucks 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.950
 move 2 to throw him around here 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.390
 and good 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:52.490
 thus later is quite 2 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.020
 15 seconds minutes 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.750
 please let's go 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.290
 that I get in here does not expect it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.290
 they expect it 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.140
 ok jump over here in ethical game plan 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.270
 It's worth the ramps 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.360
 it happened to put the ideas back 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:12.460
 to see tries vainly 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:19.170
 then because the epics epic 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:19.170
 the epic ethics ay ay ay no 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.980
 more than epic was going to be like the file 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.629
 of the life of all my channel here neighbors 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.819
 well 62 and be conscious 

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.799
 the lifelong fire of my channel was 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.390
 believes to say of all my life the fire of 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:35.349
 all my channel if I said two things to the 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.349
 bella is totally meaningless 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.390
 worth 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:49.879
 guys but that I'm not going to allow 

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.530
 never ever in life because here 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:57.379
 over here because here not just waiting 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:04:02.230
 only two will be a little bit a kid 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:02.230
 I would not imagine that stands 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:05.330
 good 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:14.420
 doing the 50 last 50 seconds 

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.420
 seconds last type 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:20.699
 shortly after behind the stone is worth or 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:20.699
 do not 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:32.230
 worth it is worth it has been my imagine 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.820
 and it's worth 

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:34.930
 the onomatopoeic moment is over but it is 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.940
 that was the only thing he felt in the 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:39.340
 at the moment I did not have any words to 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:43.320
 describe what I just those guys 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:43.320
 as it has come out of there yes I was had 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.270
 Boys 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.560
 according to two guys 10 seconds we are going to 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.560
 make the americas 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:05.240
 no no no 

00:05:05.389 --> 00:05:13.289
 come on let's go yeah winner five minutes and 

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:16.679
 survived five super ethical minutes 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:19.110
 madryn ya madryn i be awesome 

00:05:16.679 --> 00:05:21.929
 very young because this has been the 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:23.939
 first episode of good is not the sixth 

00:05:21.929 --> 00:05:25.919
 or the seventh of the series of all against 

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:27.659
 me but it's a different format it's not 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.459
 as with time limit in plan so in 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.629
 a game to death and I think it can 

00:05:29.459 --> 00:05:32.069
 to stay is more good because all 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:33.629
 against me and in unlimited plan 

00:05:32.069 --> 00:05:35.099
 time until they kill me for it 

00:05:33.629 --> 00:05:36.209
 they did a little long and apart for everything 

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:36.839
 the map the wta that also little action 

00:05:36.209 --> 00:05:37.830
 long 

00:05:36.839 --> 00:05:39.599
 so when you see you can put by the 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:42.959
 comments, I want you to do what 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.479
 same but with gabions equal or had 

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:46.469
 with trucks and a more bad bike or like 

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:47.279
 you want, you can help me with the 

00:05:46.469 --> 00:05:49.349
 comments 

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:51.209

 many times yes yes I have finished 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:05:55.529
 making videos for some idea that I 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.879
 had said by the comments not like that 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:05:58.350
 I recommend that you put it because 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:00.240
 surely then 

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:01.650
 I noticed some of your 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.570
 comments and in the end it ends up doing 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.430

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.440
