00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:05.809 

now<00:00:03.840> we<00:00:03.900> will<00:00:04.140> tackle<00:00:04.560> the<00:00:04.950> circular<00:00:05.460> ruffle

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
now we will tackle the circular ruffle

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.089 
now we will tackle the circular ruffle
I've<00:00:06.630> loaded<00:00:06.840> up<00:00:07.019> my<00:00:07.170> circular<00:00:07.590> ruffle<00:00:07.890> bass

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
I've loaded up my circular ruffle bass

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.089 
I've loaded up my circular ruffle bass
which<00:00:08.610> consists<00:00:09.030> of<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.210> big<00:00:09.540> and<00:00:10.280> small<00:00:11.280> circle

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
which consists of a big and small circle

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:15.650 
which consists of a big and small circle
the<00:00:14.099> small<00:00:14.400> circle<00:00:14.820> has<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.089> circumference

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
the small circle has a circumference

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.720 
the small circle has a circumference
that<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.080> approximately<00:00:16.379> equal<00:00:16.830> to<00:00:17.610> the

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
that is approximately equal to the

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.689 
that is approximately equal to the
length<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.599> sleeve<00:00:18.869> edge<00:00:22.429> the<00:00:23.429> small

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
length of the sleeve edge the small

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.730 
length of the sleeve edge the small
circle<00:00:24.090> is<00:00:24.179> used<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.630> as<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> guide<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.410> large

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
circle is used just as a guide the large

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.710 
circle is used just as a guide the large
circle<00:00:26.189> will<00:00:26.340> make<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.640> buffer<00:00:26.910> pad<00:00:26.939> it<00:00:27.539> needs

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
circle will make the buffer pad it needs

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.950 
circle will make the buffer pad it needs
to<00:00:27.840> be<00:00:27.960> placed<00:00:28.259> on<00:00:28.769> top<00:00:29.009> of<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.279> guide<00:00:29.490> and<00:00:29.960> the

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
to be placed on top of the guide and the

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.670 
to be placed on top of the guide and the
bigger<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.820> big<00:00:32.820> circle<00:00:33.210> is<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:34.170> longer<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
bigger the big circle is the longer the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.470 
bigger the big circle is the longer the
sleeve<00:00:34.920> will<00:00:35.070> be<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.700> folder<00:00:36.000> would<00:00:36.120> be<00:00:38.480> so

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
sleeve will be in the folder would be so

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.460 
sleeve will be in the folder would be so
first<00:00:39.810> off<00:00:39.990> we<00:00:40.200> want<00:00:40.380> to<00:00:40.410> add<00:00:40.560> a<00:00:40.590> dart<00:00:42.440> to<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
first off we want to add a dart to the

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.070 
first off we want to add a dart to the
middle<00:00:43.740> of<00:00:43.830> this<00:00:43.920> big<00:00:44.130> circle<00:00:44.960> here's<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:46.080 
middle of this big circle here's the

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.030 
middle of this big circle here's the
dart<00:00:46.320> icon<00:00:47.930> just<00:00:48.930> drag<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.350> out<00:00:50.390> and<00:00:51.710> I<00:00:52.710> want<00:00:52.950> to

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.040 
dart icon just drag it out and I want to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.700 
dart icon just drag it out and I want to
turn<00:00:53.220> off<00:00:53.430> synchronization<00:00:54.450> it's<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.410> us<00:00:55.620> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
turn off synchronization it's just us to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.380 
turn off synchronization it's just us to
go<00:00:55.830> faster<00:00:56.040> so<00:00:56.430> I'm<00:00:56.490> gonna<00:00:56.670> hit<00:00:56.910> control<00:00:57.360> D

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
go faster so I'm gonna hit control D

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.910 
go faster so I'm gonna hit control D
turn<00:00:58.320> that<00:00:58.440> off<00:00:58.590> and<00:01:00.800> now<00:01:01.800> I'm<00:01:02.100> just<00:01:02.130> going<00:01:02.610> to

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
turn that off and now I'm just going to

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:17.870 
turn that off and now I'm just going to
line<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:04.949> these<00:01:06.799> points

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.410 

and<00:01:18.090> then<00:01:18.630> I'm<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.990> to<00:01:19.140> add<00:01:19.820> points<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.240> long

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
and then I'm going to add points so long

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.420 
and then I'm going to add points so long
issues<00:01:21.720> nice<00:01:22.049> match<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.830> points<00:01:23.220> on

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
issues nice match it with the points on

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:37.280 
issues nice match it with the points on
the<00:01:23.939> small<00:01:24.299> circle<00:01:24.750> guy

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.109 

mash<00:01:38.010> up<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:38.370> side

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:43.119 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.940 

and<00:01:43.659> finally<00:01:44.530> this<00:01:44.740> side

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.330 

and<00:01:49.950> now<00:01:50.100> you<00:01:50.189> just<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:51.000> move<00:01:51.360> each<00:01:52.340> one

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
and now you just have to move each one

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.679 
and now you just have to move each one
of<00:01:53.460> these<00:01:53.899> points<00:01:56.090> so<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.390> matching<00:01:57.750> points

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
of these points so it's matching points

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:05.210 
of these points so it's matching points
on<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:01.170> small<00:02:01.679> circle<00:02:02.009> bag

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.240 

oops

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.470 

and<00:02:13.370> this<00:02:14.370> can<00:02:14.730> be<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.910> little<00:02:15.450> bit<00:02:15.720> tedious<00:02:15.990> but

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
and this can be a little bit tedious but

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.950 
and this can be a little bit tedious but
it's<00:02:18.480> not<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:19.020> holding<00:02:20.720> you<00:02:21.720> don't<00:02:21.870> really

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
it's not to holding you don't really

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:23.570 
it's not to holding you don't really
have<00:02:22.140> to<00:02:22.260> worry<00:02:22.410> about<00:02:22.530> being<00:02:22.830> too<00:02:23.250> perfect

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
have to worry about being too perfect

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:29.800 
have to worry about being too perfect
here

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.570 

program<00:02:30.680> will<00:02:32.290> give<00:02:33.290> you<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> blouse<00:02:33.920> with

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
program will give you a blouse with

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.250 
program will give you a blouse with
these<00:02:34.849> circles

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.640 

try<00:02:40.069> to<00:02:40.129> get<00:02:40.310> it<00:02:40.400> in<00:02:40.580> close

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:54.199 

and<00:02:47.280> the<00:02:47.940> last<00:02:48.180> one<00:02:50.750> okay<00:02:52.069> then<00:02:53.069> control<00:02:53.640> D<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
and the last one okay then control D and

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.979 
and the last one okay then control D and
turn<00:02:54.450> back<00:02:54.780> on<00:02:55.549> synchronization<00:02:56.549> there<00:02:58.819> so

00:02:59.979 --> 00:02:59.989 
turn back on synchronization there so

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.720 
turn back on synchronization there so
I'm<00:03:00.989> gonna<00:03:01.170> move<00:03:01.379> this<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.950> just<00:03:02.159> delete<00:03:02.580> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
I'm gonna move this and just delete the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:10.520 
I'm gonna move this and just delete the
guy<00:03:04.519> so<00:03:05.519> here's<00:03:05.760> our<00:03:05.909> ruffle<00:03:08.000> okay<00:03:09.409> then<00:03:10.409> I'll

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
guy so here's our ruffle okay then I'll

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:18.860 
guy so here's our ruffle okay then I'll
go<00:03:10.650> over<00:03:10.920> here<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:14.269> place<00:03:16.579> my<00:03:17.579> pattern<00:03:18.090> it's

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
go over here and place my pattern it's

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:27.530 
go over here and place my pattern it's
best<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.440> can<00:03:22.430> around<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.549> arm<00:03:25.970> and<00:03:26.970> note<00:03:27.299> that

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
best I can around the arm and note that

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.699 
best I can around the arm and note that
we're<00:03:27.720> going<00:03:27.840> to<00:03:27.930> keep<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.440> bright<00:03:29.190> side<00:03:29.519> up

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
we're going to keep the bright side up

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.970 
we're going to keep the bright side up
what<00:03:31.709> the<00:03:31.829> normal<00:03:32.159> is<00:03:32.220> pointing<00:03:32.430> up<00:03:32.819> here<00:03:33.980> you

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
what the normal is pointing up here you

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.940 
what the normal is pointing up here you
see<00:03:35.159> ya<00:03:35.310> start<00:03:35.849> part<00:03:36.209> is<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:37.290> backside<00:03:37.709> of<00:03:37.769> the

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
see ya start part is the backside of the

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.420 
see ya start part is the backside of the
pattern

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
pattern

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:49.510 
pattern
it's<00:03:38.940> about<00:03:39.120> utaite<00:03:39.510> down

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:57.660 

I<00:03:49.640> actually<00:03:50.360> turn<00:03:50.960> on<00:03:52.390> real<00:03:53.390> coordinate<00:03:53.810> gizmo

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:57.670 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:17.560 

better<00:04:00.220> just<00:04:01.220> a<00:04:01.400> mover<00:04:01.850> I<00:04:01.910> want

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.960 

and<00:04:18.110> you're<00:04:18.350> gonna<00:04:18.560> have<00:04:18.860> to<00:04:19.160> finesse<00:04:19.580> it<00:04:19.850> a

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
and you're gonna have to finesse it a

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.190 
and you're gonna have to finesse it a
little<00:04:20.180> bit<00:04:22.390> to<00:04:23.390> get<00:04:23.540> it<00:04:23.600> where<00:04:24.590> you<00:04:24.650> want<00:04:24.740> it

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
little bit to get it where you want it

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.120 
little bit to get it where you want it
it's<00:04:27.200> probably<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:29.170> most<00:04:30.170> annoying<00:04:30.620> part<00:04:30.980> of

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:31.130 
it's probably the most annoying part of

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.860 
it's probably the most annoying part of
this<00:04:31.700> process<00:04:33.850> just<00:04:34.850> wanna<00:04:35.060> generally<00:04:35.720> kind

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
this process just wanna generally kind

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:47.909 
this process just wanna generally kind
of<00:04:36.020> get<00:04:36.170> it<00:04:36.290> there

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 

00:04:47.919 --> 00:05:01.990 

and<00:04:48.490> now<00:04:52.379> I'm<00:04:53.379> going<00:04:53.800> to<00:04:55.139> sew<00:04:58.080> these<00:04:59.080> together

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.990 

I'm<00:05:02.450> going<00:05:02.780> to<00:05:02.900> use<00:05:03.110> the<00:05:03.410> free<00:05:04.190> song<00:05:04.460> to

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:12.000 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:22.860 

and<00:05:13.000> then<00:05:13.330> double-click<00:05:13.810> here

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:22.870 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.440 

and<00:05:23.440> make<00:05:23.650> sure<00:05:23.919> that<00:05:24.100> our<00:05:24.160> particle<00:05:24.820> distance

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:27.450 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.560 

is<00:05:28.450> 20<00:05:28.720> for<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.200> first<00:05:29.500> simulation

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:41.519 

that's<00:05:35.440> Emily

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:41.529

okay

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
okay

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:50.469 
okay
and<00:05:44.720> then<00:05:44.930> I<00:05:45.169> let<00:05:45.350> that<00:05:45.500> settle<00:05:48.460> and<00:05:49.460> then<00:05:49.850> want

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
and then I let that settle and then want

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:57.700 
and then I let that settle and then want
to<00:05:51.970> join<00:05:52.970> us<00:05:53.120> up<00:05:53.270> to<00:05:53.419> five

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.309 

and<00:05:58.750> make<00:05:59.750> sure<00:05:59.780> it's<00:06:00.140> a<00:06:00.290> silk

00:06:04.309 --> 00:06:04.319 

00:06:04.319 --> 00:06:12.900 

and<00:06:04.889> then<00:06:05.099> finish<00:06:05.490> simile

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:12.910 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:18.290 

I<00:06:13.110> forgot<00:06:14.110> one<00:06:14.350> thing<00:06:14.380> here<00:06:16.440> to<00:06:17.440> make<00:06:17.650> sure

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
I forgot one thing here to make sure

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:27.440 
I forgot one thing here to make sure
this<00:06:19.300> is<00:06:19.630> 3:16<00:06:20.590> this<00:06:21.190> same<00:06:21.730> line<00:06:23.640> okay

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:27.450

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
now you want to notice that the fullness

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:34.130 
now you want to notice that the fullness
of<00:06:31.610> the<00:06:32.610> circle<00:06:33.150> is<00:06:33.540> just<00:06:33.570> a<00:06:33.780> little<00:06:34.020> bit

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:34.140 
of the circle is just a little bit

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.230 
of the circle is just a little bit
different<00:06:34.880> than<00:06:35.880> the<00:06:36.030> straight<00:06:36.300> reform<00:06:38.240> this

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
different than the straight reform this

different than the straight reform this
circle<00:06:40.170> of<00:06:40.260> offal<00:06:40.590> looks<00:06:41.100> really<00:06:41.370> well<00:06:41.550> on

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:42.800 
circle of offal looks really well on

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:46.040 
circle of offal looks really well on
when<00:06:43.800> you<00:06:43.890> want<00:06:44.040> to<00:06:44.130> go<00:06:44.370> around<00:06:44.910> the<00:06:45.060> sleeve<00:06:45.330> at

necklines with the rough own circle it's

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:53.900 
necklines with the rough own circle it's
a<00:06:51.120> good<00:06:51.270> choice<00:06:51.420> for<00:06:51.480> that
