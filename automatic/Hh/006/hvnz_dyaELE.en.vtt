00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
actually smart ins everybody up and the

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.979 
actually smart ins everybody up and the
orchestra<00:00:34.920> plays<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.300> truly<00:00:36.300> integral<00:00:36.719> part

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
and it's fun for them but it's

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.670 
and it's fun for them but it's
interesting<00:00:39.360> and<00:00:39.690> challenging<00:00:39.899> for<00:00:40.410> them<00:00:40.500> as

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680

most this week about Doug is kooky as as
an<00:01:06.970> educator<00:01:07.450> and<00:01:07.930> I've<00:01:08.890> never<00:01:09.340> seen<00:01:09.760> that

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
an educator and I've never seen that

serious<00:01:11.830> of<00:01:11.980> an<00:01:12.160> educator<00:01:12.670> combined<00:01:13.420> into<00:01:13.900> a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
serious of an educator combined into a

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.010 
serious of an educator combined into a
person<00:01:14.410> who<00:01:14.560> has<00:01:14.740> that<00:01:14.980> much<00:01:15.190> fun<00:01:16.020> presenting

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
person who has that much fun presenting

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:18.780 
person who has that much fun presenting
what<00:01:17.440> he's<00:01:17.590> doing<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.130> these<00:01:18.250> young<00:01:18.520> people

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
what he's doing to these young people

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.180 
what he's doing to these young people
and<00:01:19.270> getting<00:01:19.780> them<00:01:19.900> still<00:01:20.260> enthusiastic<00:01:20.530> I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190 
and getting them still enthusiastic I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.190 
and getting them still enthusiastic I
think<00:01:21.430> he<00:01:21.580> left<00:01:21.760> a<00:01:21.970> lasting<00:01:22.210> impression<00:01:22.690> on

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
orchestra and maybe even anywhere to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
store for the first time because of the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.370 
store for the first time because of the
dynamic<00:01:38.350> between<00:01:38.680> Doug<00:01:39.430> and<00:01:39.750> myself<00:01:40.750> as<00:01:41.350> a

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
dynamic between Doug and myself as a

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.480 
dynamic between Doug and myself as a
conductor<00:01:41.740> was<00:01:42.600> incredible<00:01:43.600> and<00:01:43.869> it<00:01:44.410> added<00:01:45.130> so

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
conductor was incredible and it added so

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.980 
conductor was incredible and it added so
much<00:01:45.640> to<00:01:45.700> the<00:01:45.910> show<00:01:46.090> and<00:01:46.240> it<00:01:46.330> made<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.570> fun<00:01:46.780> for

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
much to the show and it made it fun for

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.290 
much to the show and it made it fun for
me<00:01:47.140> I<00:01:47.320> think<00:01:47.410> sometimes<00:01:48.369> if<00:01:48.940> you<00:01:49.119> do<00:01:49.270> a

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:49.300 
me I think sometimes if you do a

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.540 
me I think sometimes if you do a
production<00:01:50.259> like<00:01:50.410> this<00:01:50.440> it<00:01:50.800> can<00:01:50.830> be<00:01:51.040> hard<00:01:51.310> work

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:51.550 
production like this it can be hard work

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.030 
production like this it can be hard work
and<00:01:51.790> this<00:01:52.000> was<00:01:52.210> just<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.540> blast<00:01:52.780> Doug<00:01:53.770> Cameron

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
and this was just a blast Doug Cameron

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.889 
and this was just a blast Doug Cameron
brought<00:01:54.610> out<00:01:54.729> the<00:01:54.880> biggest<00:01:55.060> audience<00:01:55.420> that

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
brought out the biggest audience that

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.399 
brought out the biggest audience that
we've<00:01:56.080> ever<00:01:56.290> had

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
we've ever had

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.550 
we've ever had
