hey gang this errand with red scorpion 6
hey<00:00:05.879> I<00:00:05.910> want<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.240> show<00:00:06.480> you<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.690> new<00:00:06.930> prototype

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740 
hey I want to show you a new prototype

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.669 
hey I want to show you a new prototype
we're<00:00:08.099> working<00:00:08.400> on<00:00:08.550> for<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:09.389> sheath<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.620> a

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
we're working on for a sheath for a

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.669 
we're working on for a sheath for a
standard<00:00:11.130> k<00:00:11.580> bar<00:00:11.820> or<00:00:12.150> if<00:00:12.929> you're<00:00:13.110> carrying<00:00:13.559> a

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
standard k bar or if you're carrying a

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:19.660 
standard k bar or if you're carrying a
like<00:00:14.429> I<00:00:14.460> saw<00:00:16.220> you<00:00:17.220> know<00:00:17.520> something<00:00:18.420> like<00:00:18.510> this

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:19.670 
like I saw you know something like this

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.900 
like I saw you know something like this
we're<00:00:20.670> building<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.830> modular<00:00:22.830> design<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
we're building a modular design the

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.970 
we're building a modular design the
sheath<00:00:24.150> actually<00:00:24.689> consists<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.410> about<00:00:25.560> four

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
sheath actually consists of about four

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.319 
sheath actually consists of about four
parts<00:00:28.189> you've<00:00:29.189> got<00:00:29.490> your<00:00:30.240> body<00:00:30.539> which<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:32.329> sewn

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
parts you've got your body which is sewn

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.270 
parts you've got your body which is sewn
and<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:33.989> you'll<00:00:34.170> notice<00:00:34.440> all<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.860> eyelets

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
and then you'll notice all the eyelets

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.020 
and then you'll notice all the eyelets
that<00:00:35.460> I<00:00:35.550> put<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:35.940> here<00:00:37.070> I've<00:00:38.070> put<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.340> number<00:00:38.850> of

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
that I put in here I've put a number of

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.180 
that I put in here I've put a number of
islets<00:00:39.480> and<00:00:39.629> that's<00:00:39.840> due<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.620> this<00:00:40.829> being<00:00:40.890> a

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
islets and that's due to this being a

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.060 
islets and that's due to this being a
prototype<00:00:41.670> we've<00:00:41.910> been<00:00:42.059> testing<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.860> is

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
prototype we've been testing it this is

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.040 
prototype we've been testing it this is
this<00:00:44.520> would<00:00:44.700> be<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.820> concept<00:00:45.390> that's<00:00:45.539> available

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
this would be a concept that's available

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
this would be a concept that's available
with<00:00:46.500> or<00:00:46.710> without<00:00:46.829> all<00:00:47.160> these<00:00:47.340> islets<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:48.030> we

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
with or without all these islets so we

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.619 
with or without all these islets so we
can<00:00:48.329> make<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.480> cleaner<00:00:48.809> looking<00:00:49.230> chief<00:00:50.510> one<00:00:51.510> of

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
can make a cleaner looking chief one of

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.330 
can make a cleaner looking chief one of
the<00:00:51.719> things<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.199> we<00:00:52.410> put<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.680> on<00:00:52.829> here<00:00:53.039> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
the things that we put it on here for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
the things that we put it on here for
was<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.719> tech<00:00:55.110> lock<00:00:55.350> carry<00:00:56.129> so<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> can

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
was for tech lock carry so you can

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.029 
was for tech lock carry so you can
actually<00:00:57.059> use<00:00:57.239> this<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.109> cary<00:00:58.559> with<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> tech

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
actually use this in cary with the tech

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.099 
actually use this in cary with the tech
locks<00:00:59.250> or<00:00:59.609> you<00:01:00.030> can<00:01:00.180> carry<00:01:00.390> with<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> straps

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
locks or you can carry with the straps

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.410 
locks or you can carry with the straps
and<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:02.190> straps<00:01:02.520> we've<00:01:02.910> been<00:01:03.030> experimenting

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
and the straps we've been experimenting

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.399 
and the straps we've been experimenting
with<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.840> wraparound<00:01:04.320> style<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:07.290> it

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
with a wraparound style and so it

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.960 
with a wraparound style and so it
actually<00:01:07.590> wraps<00:01:08.040> around<00:01:08.220> the<00:01:08.430> body<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:08.909> the

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
actually wraps around the body and the

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.800 
actually wraps around the body and the
sheath<00:01:10.490> so<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.090> one<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> the<00:01:12.570> other<00:01:12.720> things

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
sheath so and one of the other things

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.780 
sheath so and one of the other things
are<00:01:13.170> done<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.710> our<00:01:14.659> strap<00:01:15.860> is<00:01:16.860> it<00:01:17.189> notice<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
are done is our strap is it notice that

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.440 
are done is our strap is it notice that
snaps<00:01:18.240> on<00:01:18.479> both<00:01:18.659> sides<00:01:19.020> well<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:21.030> works<00:01:21.210> well

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
snaps on both sides well that works well

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.640 
snaps on both sides well that works well
if<00:01:21.659> you're<00:01:21.780> in<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.930> tech<00:01:22.140> locked<00:01:22.409> configuration

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
if you're in a tech locked configuration

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.550 
if you're in a tech locked configuration
or<00:01:23.580> you<00:01:23.850> have<00:01:24.000> your<00:01:24.180> strap<00:01:24.479> move<00:01:24.750> down<00:01:25.049> but<00:01:25.470> if

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
or you have your strap move down but if

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.140 
or you have your strap move down but if
you<00:01:25.650> have<00:01:25.770> your<00:01:25.860> strap<00:01:26.130> moves<00:01:26.400> high<00:01:26.670> because

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you have your strap moves high because

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.609 
you have your strap moves high because
you've<00:01:27.390> got<00:01:27.509> let's<00:01:27.780> say<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> handle<00:01:28.380> heavy

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
you've got let's say a handle heavy

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.280 
you've got let's say a handle heavy
night<00:01:28.860> something<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:30.210> k-bar<00:01:30.780> for

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
night something like a k-bar for

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.490 
night something like a k-bar for
instance<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.310> we<00:01:32.400> put<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.500> what

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
instance and we put this in here what

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.520 
instance and we put this in here what
happens<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:36.500> the<00:01:38.509> handle<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:39.869> heavy<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
happens is the handle is so heavy that

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
happens is the handle is so heavy that
if<00:01:41.369> you<00:01:41.490> wear<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.790> back<00:01:41.939> here<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> has<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
if you wear it back here it has a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.800 
if you wear it back here it has a
tendency<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:43.490> hang<00:01:44.490> low<00:01:44.759> off<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> belt<00:01:45.540> we

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
tendency to hang low off of the belt we

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.960 
tendency to hang low off of the belt we
can<00:01:46.020> experiment<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> here<00:01:47.640> but<00:01:47.850> you

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
can experiment and put it here but you

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.200 
can experiment and put it here but you
still<00:01:48.180> got<00:01:48.329> some<00:01:48.540> drop<00:01:49.380> but<00:01:50.100> here<00:01:50.579> is<00:01:50.729> about

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
still got some drop but here is about

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.690 
still got some drop but here is about
the<00:01:51.659> where<00:01:52.619> it's<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.860> to<00:01:52.920> be<00:01:52.979> balanced<00:01:53.549> at

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
the where it's going to be balanced at

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:54.859 
the where it's going to be balanced at
and<00:01:53.909> it's<00:01:54.030> going<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.210> be<00:01:54.299> good<00:01:54.420> for<00:01:54.659> good

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
and it's going to be good for good

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
even do a similar concept for like a

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.370 
even do a similar concept for like a
cold<00:03:38.000> steel<00:03:39.790> trailmaster<00:03:41.230> something<00:03:42.230> like

that<00:03:42.650> we<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.190> make<00:03:43.760> it<00:03:43.790> shorter<00:03:44.390> we<00:03:45.050> could<00:03:45.230> do

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
that we just make it shorter we could do

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.430 
that we just make it shorter we could do
the<00:03:45.950> Fall<00:03:46.790> River<00:03:47.060> Bravo<00:03:47.510> one<00:03:47.900> in<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.230> same

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
the Fall River Bravo one in the same

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.880 
the Fall River Bravo one in the same
style<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.400> sheath<00:03:49.870> we<00:03:50.870> have<00:03:51.050> obviously<00:03:51.560> make

style of sheath we have obviously make
it<00:03:52.040> shorter<00:03:52.490> through<00:03:53.090> the<00:03:53.270> straps<00:03:53.600> hand<00:03:53.959> so<00:03:54.770> I

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
it shorter through the straps hand so I

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.970 
it shorter through the straps hand so I
mean<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.580> can<00:03:55.730> be<00:03:55.910> for<00:03:56.630> various<00:03:57.470> types<00:03:57.770> of
