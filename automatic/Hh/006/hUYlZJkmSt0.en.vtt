00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
opportunities I think they're starting

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.149 
opportunities I think they're starting
to<00:02:55.870> get<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.049> bit<00:02:56.409> of<00:02:56.470> momentum<00:02:56.680> the

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
to get a bit of momentum the

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.970 
to get a bit of momentum the
disappointment<00:02:57.790> of<00:02:57.879> the<00:02:58.260> 1872<00:02:59.260> cut<00:02:59.560> wasps<00:02:59.799> I
