00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:19.320
 we are here again with the program 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.560
 phenomenon by the world television network 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.810
 today again interview a psychologist 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.030
 ricardo de almeida ricardo thank you 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.830
 is here with us in the week environment 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.560
 There was no time 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:35.160
 we are not a little bit more the use of 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:38.010
 hypnosis in ufology as you see use 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.190
 of hypnosis first is hypnosis state 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.470
 altered consciousness is not me 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.739
 I would like you to put it quickly 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.780
 your opinion the use of hypnosis did not flee 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.930
 Then you will comment on something 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:54.270
 hypnosis itself the risks that run 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.379
 hypnosis induction a number of things 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 then it is widely used in cases 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.950
 what is said of abduction is the 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 tool 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.350
 And then I think there's a lot of danger. 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.369
 great because the first that the state of 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.009
 hypnosis 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.229
 it is induced and can be faked 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:20.009
 second I can give through 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 ask questions and we know the 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.350
 person for certain sensations and 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.050
 perhaps even memories that will be in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.509
 implanted in the famous induction 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.580
 Exactly then what happens is a 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.880
 very difficult to use tool. 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.830
 hypnotist has to have the balance 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.020
 know how to formulate the questions in a 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:44.490
 too gray has to be neutral and 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:47.940
 the exemption ends and sometimes there is even 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.360
 willingness to make the case true 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 guy asking the question that induces or 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.509
 at least Hindu power and we'll get the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.830
 example to make it clear that the 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.899
 viewer 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.840
 Ricardo will do a hypnosis for 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.319
 example a person and he will induce without 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.319
 want is that in this induction only occurs 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:10.140
 since then I can say so are you 

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:12.900
 remember seeing a light today have 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.660
 feeling something by grabbing it 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.360
 being seeing something that seemed 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.780
 one in the room such thing is not 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.819
 clearly I've already made an image 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:25.680
 so if something catches me 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.499
 I said in the alley how are you saying 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.569
 today was praised if you put in the 

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:33.900
 youtube ufologia 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:37.170
 you will spend your life watching movies 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.180
 report testimonials about ecology o 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.150
 which is very rich but at the same time 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.639
 also give you on the basis of a 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.439
 base so you can collabo- 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:49.349
 fable these things all 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:52.889
 depending on how the hypnologist accesses 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:54.900
 these experiences and I remember until I 

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.900
 the last congress that 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:01.680
 there is clear research today that 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.159
 memory that we think is ours and 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.750
 our experiences may have been 

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:10.310
 borrowed from others, we have to 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.510
 noticed we just is 

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.510
 absorbing the mothers with our 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.019
 influence will say in the collective without 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:22.319
 accurate perception is there is a 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:26.400
 classic of a psychologist who is 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:29.459
 a problem of 11 analyzed and following 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.769
 It seems to me that this kind of thing has 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.129
 to see what I'm wearing with some of your 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:37.229
 started like this, and it seems to me 

00:03:35.129 --> 00:03:39.540
 that has to do with crowd by the fact 

00:03:37.229 --> 00:03:41.280
 How you tell will be that you 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.439
 did not get lost at the mall when it was 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.989
 child and this 

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:48.150
 this event was blocked by the 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.729
 anxiety to be without her mother and she 

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.709
 It started one hour and one hour. 

00:03:50.729 --> 00:03:56.310
 ended up coming to a session of the year 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.949
 I really remembered yesterday that 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.139
 It happened and then I told him no. 

00:03:58.949 --> 00:04:02.489
 This has not happened, I'm inducing you. 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.909
 to multiple sessions 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:09.239
 and then the plan that went there did not 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:10.949
 accepted no you did not induce me already 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.319
 Had it really happened to you? 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:16.139
 Just reminded me so I see she's done. 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.799
 to deploy a fake memory memory and 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:22.740
 that he denies that it is he swore that 

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:26.159
 had gone through that event then 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.289
 see the complexity of the human mind is 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:30.810
 very complicated with the very common is the 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:33.539
 message in terms of deduction are you 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:36.719
 see the internet is very common the person in the 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.650
 hypnosis pinata because I do not live 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:40.710
 I'm seeing a light. 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.050
 Enoch speaks a ship you want. You play. 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.600
 all the hypnosis out you just 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.500
 induce a person in the field is the team to 

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:51.660
 here we are a very tool 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.949
 significant change in relation to 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.840
 behavior 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:57.300
 I remember a case at the congress between 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.880
 psychologists the pilot soon got 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.280
 a sledgehammer and glue was in the audience is 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.130
 who reported on the stage and then said that she 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.199
 I was going to get a suggestion here. 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.449
 she wants him to give the selection can 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.669
 ride and that when she tried to return 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.310
 to his place in the auditorium to settle 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.550
 could not and she actually got out of the 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.860
 Hypnosis thanked and then the whole 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:23.520
 what the people are waiting for her to sit 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:26.660
 she directs her place and there was 1 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.580
 a bit confusing because she was trying 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.919
 could not make the move and 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:33.660
 then she really was terrified 

00:05:31.919 --> 00:05:36.240
 because everyone caught could not 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:38.039
 sit he asked for calm wing came back to 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:40.320
 put of 90 withdrew 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:41.789
 So you see, it 's one thing I remember. 

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:44.760
 another takes the shoe in that one 

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:46.260
 Congress took the shoe and played with 

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:48.300
 auditorium and then stood looking in the face 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:51.210
 everybody wants me to do it 

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:54.030
 It is good to say the following all these 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:59.310
 acts do not imply and no 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:06:00.690
 better and no moral modification of the 

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:02.669
 bdo cruzado 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:04.909
 let's put you can not force a 

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:06.690
 Hypnosis is nothing other than your 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:08.729
 exactly that it is morally 

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:10.830
 contact said 'we were things' 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:13.349
 comic as long as one stays with the 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.900
 I'm barking 

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:18.780
 but none of this goes against the morality of 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:22.260
 hypnosis independent plane and so 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.949
 You're going to be naked. It's difficult. What 's the 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.010
 do 

00:06:22.949 --> 00:06:28.139
 it would be somebody all this is going to be 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:28.860
 against the morale of the hypnotist will not 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:31.199
 to happen 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:33.270
 a friend of mine is nei oak too 

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:35.250
 likes and flee we do congress 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:38.639
 together in the house in the neighborhood rangel that new 

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:40.530
 that you know he did not induce the tires 

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:44.130
 next every five minutes look at the 

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:46.529
 what time will you speak marques 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.479
 I think I 'm going to do this is absurd 

00:06:46.529 --> 00:06:51.470
 Ah, and that and keep talking here 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:53.900
 that's because I do not know what 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:55.660
 and such is and where he spoke no 

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.400
 started laughing 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.490
 he looked at the Simo said you could 

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:03.560
 exercised and consciously understood 

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.960
 that but it was an act 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.530
 tactically he did not have the volunteer 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:12.380
 here on the river I looked at the clock, right? 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:14.750
 the viewer can also 

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:15.920
 we are sensitive to this simple without 

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.110
 to perceive 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:20.270
 we have our middle and marshes 

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:22.460
 inducing a lot to us our 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:24.980
 first break we have been back by 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.720
 second block continuing a hypnosis is 

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.180
 the benefits it can cause when 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.320
 wrong person then let's go to the 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.320
 second block already
