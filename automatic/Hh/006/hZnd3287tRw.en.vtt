staddon<00:00:59.250> the<00:01:00.180> carrying<00:01:00.660> handle<00:01:00.899> wire<00:01:01.859> thing

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
staddon the carrying handle wire thing

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.609 
staddon the carrying handle wire thing
that<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.430> me<00:01:02.609> the<00:01:03.359> wire<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.170> was<00:01:04.379> made<00:01:04.589> out

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
that was me the wire this was made out

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.789 
that was me the wire this was made out
of<00:01:04.830> a<00:01:05.070> clothes<00:01:05.519> hanger<00:01:05.960> which<00:01:06.960> i<00:01:07.110> just<00:01:07.409> cut<00:01:07.680> up

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
of a clothes hanger which i just cut up

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.240 
of a clothes hanger which i just cut up
and<00:01:07.979> bent<00:01:08.760> with<00:01:08.939> pliers<00:01:09.180> and<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:10.680> entire<00:01:10.950> body

and bent with pliers and the entire body

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.690 
and bent with pliers and the entire body
of<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:12.439> so<00:01:13.439> i<00:01:13.470> can<00:01:13.560> prove<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.460> fake

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
of this so i can prove that this is fake

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.730 
of this so i can prove that this is fake
as<00:01:14.970> a<00:01:15.000> line<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:15.960> not<00:01:16.110> a<00:01:16.140> real<00:01:16.350> landmine<00:01:16.710> i

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
as a line it's not a real landmine i

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.859 
as a line it's not a real landmine i
left<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.159> bottom<00:01:17.430> blue<00:01:17.670> this<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.600> an<00:01:18.689> old

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
clock so if you see here there's some

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.179 
clock so if you see here there's some
hot<00:01:24.390> glue<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> bottom<00:01:24.840> but<00:01:25.170> um<00:01:25.320> that's

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
hot glue on the bottom but um that's

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.670 
hot glue on the bottom but um that's
where<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.490> would<00:01:26.580> hang<00:01:26.729> this<00:01:26.909> thing<00:01:26.970> up<00:01:27.299> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
where you would hang this thing up and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.749 
where you would hang this thing up and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
normally would hang up on the wall like

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.990 
normally would hang up on the wall like
that<00:01:30.000> but<00:01:30.299> i<00:01:30.540> gave<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> entire<00:01:32.400> paint<00:01:32.820> job

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000
