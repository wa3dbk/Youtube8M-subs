00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
and I like to create that zigzag on top

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.759 
and I like to create that zigzag on top
that<00:04:17.540> way<00:04:17.660> there's<00:04:17.840> no<00:04:17.900> pressure<00:04:18.290> for<00:04:18.560> it<00:04:18.650> to

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
that way there's no pressure for it to

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.490 
that way there's no pressure for it to
be<00:04:18.890> completely<00:04:19.310> perfectly<00:04:19.880> flat<00:04:20.380> now<00:04:21.380> I'm

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
be completely perfectly flat now I'm

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.080 
be completely perfectly flat now I'm
taking<00:04:21.829> that<00:04:21.950> reserved<00:04:22.370> 1/2<00:04:22.610> cup<00:04:22.790> of<00:04:22.880> frosting

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.830 
taking that reserved 1/2 cup of frosting
and<00:04:23.480> I'm<00:04:23.930> piping<00:04:24.260> on<00:04:24.380> a<00:04:24.410> little<00:04:24.680> cloud<00:04:24.890> border

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
and I'm piping on a little cloud border

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.850 
and I'm piping on a little cloud border
you<00:04:26.840> can<00:04:26.990> see<00:04:27.140> I'm<00:04:27.230> making<00:04:27.560> them<00:04:27.650> all

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
you can see I'm making them all

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.440 
you can see I'm making them all
different<00:04:28.250> sizes<00:04:28.460> which<00:04:28.790> I<00:04:28.910> think<00:04:29.150> makes<00:04:29.360> it

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
different sizes which I think makes it

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.630 
different sizes which I think makes it
look<00:04:29.630> more<00:04:29.780> like<00:04:30.020> little<00:04:30.170> clouds<00:04:30.520> then<00:04:31.520> I'm

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
look more like little clouds then I'm

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.190 
look more like little clouds then I'm
dipping<00:04:31.820> my<00:04:31.970> finger<00:04:32.120> in<00:04:32.510> some<00:04:32.540> water<00:04:32.870> and<00:04:33.110> just

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
pressing down the little points on the

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.820 
pressing down the little points on the
clouds<00:04:35.210> and<00:04:35.480> then<00:04:36.140> I'm<00:04:36.230> going<00:04:36.410> to<00:04:36.500> make<00:04:36.680> the

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
clouds and then I'm going to make the

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.860 
clouds and then I'm going to make the
final<00:04:37.190> big<00:04:37.400> cloud<00:04:37.670> on<00:04:37.820> top<00:04:38.060> so<00:04:38.630> I'm<00:04:38.720> just

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
final big cloud on top so I'm just

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.830 
final big cloud on top so I'm just
piping<00:04:39.230> on<00:04:39.350> some<00:04:39.560> more<00:04:39.710> dots<00:04:39.950> of<00:04:40.220> frosting<00:04:40.840> you

piping on some more dots of frosting you
can<00:04:41.870> see<00:04:42.140> this<00:04:42.260> is<00:04:42.410> really<00:04:42.680> just<00:04:42.860> a<00:04:42.950> fun<00:04:43.160> part
