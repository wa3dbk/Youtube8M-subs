00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.230
 are here android again bringing 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.439
 It's a new session, ask to bring 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.630
 about the previous video that we upload or 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:24.119
 be the actress series to develop 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.460
 extraordinary shoulders an excellent 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.189
 day giving everything to achieve the 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.010
 objectives remember that life is one and 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.100
 we must achieve all the goals that we 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.350
 let's propose now yes guys let's start 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.250
 with today's video the first 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.769
 Question 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.680
 our friend I said generates so we 

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:46.340
 says on YouTube very good videos both 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.340
 it helped me a lot of thanks 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.380
 what I have is how often I have 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.770
 that train my shoulders I train 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.110
 four times a week and brother that 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.880
 it depends on your level of physical consumption 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:01.690
 where are you looking to get in your 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:05.059
 body for example for a person 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.600
 intermediate beginner let's say if it continues 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:10.250
 a divided routine is normal and 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.090
 advisable that you can train a 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.189
 once a week 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.460
 as we have commented in a video 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:18.869
 The more exercises and series your 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.179
 training plan for a 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.210
 certain muscle that means that 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.969
 in the week you will train the least 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.709
 frequent mean if your plan 

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:31.350
 training for example as the routine 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:34.079
 that we have usually in the video that are of 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.579
 four exercises ideally in that case 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:37.740
 due to the volume that has 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:40.740
 training is that you train us one 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.750
 once a week now a beginner 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.970
 let's say two main areas that 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.970
 follow a whole body routine in 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.039
 which between three a week and in each 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.689
 one of those three times follow a routine 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.200
 of a full body or an exercise 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.289
 for each muscle then it's normal that 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.229
 train those three times shoulders ok 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.329
 because every day only trains a 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.719
 Exercise of three to four series 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:09.000
 look muscular now someone 

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:12.170
 advanced that already equals in a good mass 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.720
 muscle and they realize they need 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:18.720
 prioritize your shoulders can train 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.970
 two heavy weeks and four 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.770
 exercises let's say at each point is a 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.100
 training day it is something 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.060
 advanced ok now let's move on to the next 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.420
 Question 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.880
 our friend tiger or more tells us in 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.310
 facebook that is giving greetings 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.770
 from new york my question from the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.990
 next interview and the biceps and 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:43.110
 now in the actress would be without shoulders the 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.900
 rest time is 60 seconds 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.050
 what happens if you rest a little more for 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:51.720
 example two minutes that would affect the 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.550
 results of the free routine are going to 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.800
 keep in mind that a plan of 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.690
 well thought out training for something you 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.000
 puts the rest time that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:03.030
 specifies if we say the plan 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.370
 training says 60 seconds 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:08.430
 give yourself account characterization and in 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.740
 this case and you perform in two minutes 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.819
 of rest or three minutes even the 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.810
 break 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:17.370
 the effect will not be the same as what is 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.579
 put to get the trainings then 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.579
 you are not following the indications 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:25.349
 respective ok then you must meet 

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:28.780
 Always rest time 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.840
 specify the plan that is heaven 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.200
 for example, bodybuilders and 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.090
 Factory workers train different one 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.940
 focuses I think it's to gain muscle mass 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.600
 burn fat because the symmetry to be seen 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.730
 well instead the other just does not matter 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.880
 to train to achieve the maximum 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:52.090
 possible force and therefore one of the 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:55.120
 factors that mainly varies is that 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.190
 the rest time is much longer in 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.069
 favors of interest that in the 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:02.470
 bodybuilders ok different systems 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.130
 of training different results 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.850
 so now you know let's move on to the next 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:09.820
 Question 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:12.760
 our eardrum friend tells us in 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.519
 youtube the second exercise is for 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:19.060
 trapeze well 3 you are presented that there 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:21.190
 two main types of rowing around the neck 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.070
 start in the video is the one that uses 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:26.650
 the hands apart that 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:30.370
 it is mainly for them to develop 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.389
 I'm his grave because all this 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.190
 zone instead when you use your hands 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.639
 social meetings I come to the neck with hands 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.730
 together there is a priority what are the trapezoids 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.370
 so it's very important that you know 

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:47.110
 differentiate between both types of risk 

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:49.540
 to the neck and tense which is mainly 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.289
 my thigh that you're working remember 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.300
 more separated 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:56.149
 It is mainly for the sectors 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:59.680
 lateral and when we hold hands together 

00:04:56.149 --> 00:05:03.169
 it's mainly for the trapezoids that 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.419
 let's move on to the next question of the day 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:07.849
 today our friend mauro gutierrez us 

00:05:05.419 --> 00:05:10.009
 says on facebook on the computer trailer 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:13.520
 I want to congratulate you on all your videos 

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:15.529
 and tips are very effective and they serve 

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:18.529
 so that little by little they are fulfilling my 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:20.990
 objectives I want to know if you 're sad of 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.089
 shoulders is for a volume stage or 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.430
 of definition with which another group 

00:05:23.089 --> 00:05:28.459
 muscle can be combined greetings 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.289
 from argentina well first anxiety 

00:05:28.459 --> 00:05:32.240
 thank you very much for less videos 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.869
 brothers gives us a lot of weakness as 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.580
 to help you achieve your goals and you

 welcome as always to this 

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.860
 community 30 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.480
 the first one is I want to know if this 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:47.540
 actress of others is a flame person of 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.840
 volume or definition well this routine 

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.840
 It can be used in both types of 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:55.670
 objectives because you should not mentalize the 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.130
 that guarantee or any other super 

00:05:55.670 --> 00:06:00.350
 series is only for definition and 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:02.840
 the things that counter and rest series 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.940
 it's just for volume is not it 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:07.520
 both can be used in both 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.470
 cases as you select your other question 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.590
 is with what other muscle group will it be 

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.770
 you can combine this routine well 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:18.740
 agreement combine with another muscle but 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:21.290
 that is small for example the encores 

00:06:18.740 --> 00:06:23.900
 the gray is excellent as muscular 

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:25.790
 as you can combine this 

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:28.310
 routine the next question of the day of 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:31.310
 today our friend john brings it to us 

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:33.410
 halder ruiz that tells us on youtube not 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:35.870
 I count with the pulley crossing machine 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:38.320
 for later shoulders friends with what 

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:40.870
 another exercise for the pass 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.330
 hug strong brother okay if you do not have 

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:46.180
 that machine then you can perform with 

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.010
 more ropes the rear elevations 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.320
 just as I am showing you in these 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:52.780
 moments as you will realize the 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:55.180
 posterior shoulders are being fine 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.460
 stimulated then to realize that 

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:59.710
 exercise you must ensure that not six 

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:02.380
 thrown down and you squeeze them 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:04.540
 raise the dumbbells so you know 

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:07.120
 so use later elevations with 

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:09.700
 dumbbells if they do not consist like the machine 

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:11.680
 of pulley cross of your tractor video 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:14.380
 of today we hope to have resolved 

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.900
 the doubts they had about the video 13 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:18.190
 to develop shoulders you have history 

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:20.680
 that in the next video we will be 

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:24.190
 presenting again a new section 

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:26.940
 of food 3 so I'll see you in the 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:26.940
 next video
