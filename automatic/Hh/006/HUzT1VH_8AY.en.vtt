listen<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:34.950> I<00:01:34.979> think<00:01:35.220> if<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.549> listen<00:01:35.939> and

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
listen and so I think if you listen and

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.420 
listen and so I think if you listen and
you<00:01:36.180> show<00:01:36.570> up<00:01:36.780> you<00:01:37.020> resist<00:01:37.530> the<00:01:37.680> urge<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:38.100> flee

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
you show up you resist the urge to flee

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.020 
you show up you resist the urge to flee
I<00:01:38.759> think<00:01:39.979> I'll<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> pretty<00:01:41.310> good<00:01:41.400> dad<00:01:41.729> and

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
I think I'll be a pretty good dad and

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.639 
I think I'll be a pretty good dad and
and<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.329> not<00:01:42.570> about<00:01:42.780> it's<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.259> about<00:01:43.320> the

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
and it's not about it's not about the

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.819 
and it's not about it's not about the
toys<00:01:43.890> it's<00:01:44.460> about<00:01:44.610> showing<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.659> every<00:01:46.020> day<00:01:46.170> now

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
toys it's about showing up every day now

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.590 
toys it's about showing up every day now
that's<00:01:47.070> been<00:01:47.280> a<00:01:47.369> common<00:01:47.790> thread<00:01:48.180> through<00:01:48.540> all

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
that's been a common thread through all

get I mean I've got kids doing doing
real<00:02:06.060> math<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.570> real<00:02:06.689> science<00:02:07.170> just<00:02:07.619> because

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
real math and real science just because

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.169 
real math and real science just because
there's<00:02:08.160> a<00:02:08.250> roller<00:02:08.429> coaster<00:02:08.789> ride<00:02:08.819> at<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
there's a roller coaster ride at the

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.300 
there's a roller coaster ride at the
other<00:02:09.330> side<00:02:09.569> of<00:02:09.599> it

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
other side of it

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.540 
other side of it
so<00:02:11.349> you<00:02:12.349> know<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.500> mean<00:02:12.680> will<00:02:12.890> if<00:02:13.190> there's<00:02:13.489> a

reward we're gonna we're going to get
into<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:15.349> and<00:02:15.650> then<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.370> the<00:02:17.060> challenges<00:02:17.569> of

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
into it and then the the challenges of

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.330 
into it and then the the challenges of
building<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.200> thing<00:02:18.440> we're<00:02:18.739> kind<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.069> an

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
building the thing we're kind of an

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.370 
building the thing we're kind of an
adventure<00:02:20.030> building<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.599> track<00:02:20.840> had<00:02:21.080> its<00:02:21.230> own

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
adventure building the track had its own

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.559 
adventure building the track had its own
set<00:02:21.680> of<00:02:21.709> had<00:02:22.310> its<00:02:22.489> own<00:02:22.610> set<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:22.910> adventures<00:02:23.390> and

set of had its own set of adventures and

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.630 
set of had its own set of adventures and
then<00:02:23.660> building<00:02:23.959> the<00:02:24.080> cart<00:02:24.349> was<00:02:24.590> a<00:02:24.620> real<00:02:24.890> real

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
then building the cart was a real real

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.270 
then building the cart was a real real
thing<00:02:26.000> just<00:02:26.330> because<00:02:27.190> managing<00:02:28.190> a

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
thing just because managing a

same time and need to be connected to

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.420 
same time and need to be connected to
rails<00:02:36.019> within<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.620> quarter<00:02:36.890> of<00:02:36.920> an<00:02:37.130> inch<00:02:37.220> it

rails within a quarter of an inch it

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.970 
rails within a quarter of an inch it
turned<00:02:38.000> out<00:02:38.090> to<00:02:38.269> be<00:02:38.390> a<00:02:38.650> heck<00:02:39.650> of<00:02:39.739> a<00:02:39.830> lot<00:02:39.860> more

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
turned out to be a heck of a lot more

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.770 
turned out to be a heck of a lot more
than<00:02:41.530> have<00:02:42.530> you<00:02:42.650> taken<00:02:42.890> at<00:02:43.040> first<00:02:43.250> bin<00:02:43.489> I<00:02:43.780> rode

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
than have you taken at first bin I rode

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:46.390 
than have you taken at first bin I rode
the<00:02:44.989> the<00:02:45.260> red<00:02:45.440> cart<00:02:45.769> that<00:02:45.920> you've<00:02:46.069> seen<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.310> lot

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
the the red cart that you've seen a lot

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.400 
the the red cart that you've seen a lot
I<00:02:46.760> wrote<00:02:46.940> that<00:02:47.180> one<00:02:47.420> or<00:02:47.600> one<00:02:47.959> or<00:02:48.080> two<00:02:48.200> times

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
I wrote that one or one or two times

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.870 
I wrote that one or one or two times
just<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.830> make<00:02:49.010> sure<00:02:49.040> it<00:02:49.250> was<00:02:49.370> safe<00:02:49.580> you<00:02:49.790> know

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
just to make sure it was safe you know

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.539 
just to make sure it was safe you know
we<00:02:50.060> test<00:02:50.930> I've<00:02:51.470> got<00:02:51.620> an<00:02:51.709> aviation<00:02:52.130> background

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
we test I've got an aviation background

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:54.009 
we test I've got an aviation background
and<00:02:52.670> so<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:52.790> test<00:02:53.090> everything<00:02:53.360> to<00:02:53.630> two<00:02:53.750> or<00:02:53.870> three

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
and so I test everything to two or three

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.589 
and so I test everything to two or three
hundred<00:02:54.110> percent<00:02:54.560> and<00:02:54.819> and<00:02:55.819> this<00:02:56.060> cart<00:02:56.420> this

hundred percent and and this cart this
new<00:02:56.900> cart<00:02:57.200> which<00:02:57.349> we<00:02:57.500> call<00:02:57.680> the<00:02:57.799> crossbow<00:02:58.340> that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640

new cart which we call the crossbow that
when<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.880> built<00:02:59.239> so<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.569> I<00:02:59.690> could<00:02:59.780> ride<00:03:00.140> this

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:00.349 
when I built so that I could ride this

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:02.530 
when I built so that I could ride this
thing<00:03:00.410> after<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.099> after<00:03:01.670> the<00:03:01.700> time<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.000> put<00:03:02.420> in

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
thing after the after the time I put in

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.750 
thing after the after the time I put in
so<00:03:02.780> that<00:03:03.140> when<00:03:03.440> I<00:03:03.470> can<00:03:03.680> ride<00:03:03.920> all<00:03:04.220> right<00:03:04.489> well

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
so that when I can ride all right well
