00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.140
 hello you live and welcome 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:06.480
 It will be back in my kitchen today 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.599
 very fresh healthy and delicious to go 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.070
 Today I make smoothies a real one 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.840
 delicious drink as I think 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.089
 Breakfast awesome as a dessert and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.340
 somehow he always goes so what 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:26.640
 I still do not tell smoothies and me 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:28.199
 would say to equal the ingredients for 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.480
 The smoothie is really great 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.250
 manageable but it does that for him 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 no break really delicious we 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.719
 need one week 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.040
 half banana some lemon juice and me 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.989
 take some rice milk 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.940
 you can not use normal milk 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.489
 or some yogurt if you want and 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.219
 I would say we mix that's all 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.260
 together and then the drink is too 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.110
 already finished I have all now 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:54.300
 ingredients are done in the blender 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.520
 all the details of the recipe 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.260
 of course in the infobox and ultimately 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.480
 The neat thing about the mixer 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.100
 hunt everything is mashed and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.180
 then we can do it all the same 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.240
 serve already 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.610
 that he is now the two smoothies person 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.780
 small bottles filled with straws 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.900
 a bit but the children have 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.850
 can drink live and now which 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.520

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.670

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:29.369

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.259

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.810
 extends the sweetness of the banana I've 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.430
 now absolutely no sugar reingetan 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.680
 away to happiness by the raspberries me 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.990
 like the super happy I could me times 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.909
 Imagine if you ran the sweet 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.649
 to take some vanilla sugar or something 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.680
 agave syrup a bit honey or 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.720
 even sugar tastes great in the 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.060
 winter as in summer for me a pleasure 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.180
 suitable as a dessert or what I know 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.120
 So really delicious and I am 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:05.400
 glad that I still stand here two h 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.910
 Feed the candian and come now 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:10.650
 I would say it's music number two 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:13.470
 now comes the drink number two 

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:16.500
 really refreshing grapefruit 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.020
 banana smoothie of something richer 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.360
 so light with oatmeal 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.610
 made for it is really very delicate 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.950
 oatmeal and so is the 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.590
 I also like smoothie as if 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:31.680
 in between, if you like that a bit 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.560
 gets hungry or even here 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.120

 baby baby and toddler food suitable 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:48.120

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:51.960

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:54.810
