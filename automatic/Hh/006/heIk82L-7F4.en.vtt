00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 So who exits creatively and today 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:08.010
 my greeting goes to a berliner take 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.510
 me to the konditor show with dennis that 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.400
 is a channel I like to look at 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.139
 youtube and I have been around for quite some time 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.080
 diligently following because it always has 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.640
 cool things again and of course that 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.080
 I also like to be inspired and 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.600
 not just do not need this time 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.439
 and had to resist his europe 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.180
 imitate 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.970
 people I was wolf because it has me 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 not really promised that much 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.750
 just terrific and that's why 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.880
 I would have this , too 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.469
 Imagine this time directly 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.090
 But I want to visit it just as much 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.760
 the visit is worthwhile in any case 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.360
 because the man is a trained confectioner 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.420
 so come on over here is the link 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 to his side and therefore ever 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.600
 Many Thanks 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.440
 and now we start with the nonsense 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.440
 Let's go 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:03.930

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.060
 So bad so first water to cook 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.300

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:23.000
 Facchin agreement so and something but 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:25.820
 is on, we can set do it that way 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.380
 our chocolate in hand here 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.330
 so melt during our chocolate 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.119
 we are already melting our idea in the war 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:35.580
 are 32 pieces and how do we do it 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.039
 once a bit small for ours 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:44.160
 carnival years now it really works 

00:01:41.039 --> 00:01:47.039
 Quick cut we just look the 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.729
 oreo cookies small mention beautifully further 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.729
 can handle 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 32 small cuts oreo biscuits wonderful 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.780
 We also get some more with that 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.860
 as a delicious sums up so and so 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.570
 You are already melting chocolate 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.960
 happy just as it is 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.929
 heard and I like that 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.910
 that's why it does not need too much 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.750
 with humor you accelerate that 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.070
 whole a bit yes what should one 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.540
 make agreement words when the 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.829
 chocolate is liquid we lead the 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.040
 just here meant something 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:24.810
 bigger bowl than the minister 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.480
 the remaining ingredients even more into it 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 next to 400 grams of chocolate white 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.500
 Chocolate quarters have taken one 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.120
 dose a bit and another 400 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.280
 gram as there is great the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.519
 condensed milk is from Wesley or 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.070
 a Russian variety, there are also 

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:43.170
 on gourmet departments in 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.540
 supermarkets and if we all that 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.010
 have been pouring together 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.510
 then it becomes easy and with that 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.310
 whisk there is a bit 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.720
 difficult by the chocolate though 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.480
 All in all Messi co 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.290
 we have an ingenious consistency there 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:59.820
 every case is so easy to get 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.830
 our very well biscuits there with inside 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:03.120
 poured 

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.130
 liborius and we just lift each other 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.720
 just happy down the whisk 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.340
 then it always fits so completely but with 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.650
 He gets a great spoonful of spoons 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.170
 heard and you already see how fast 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.250
 I can do it and shows but does 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:20.040
 happy and if we have that then 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:23.070
 Mulled in the best sense is small 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.630
 So shell is not quite the size and 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:29.700
 I'll just give it here now 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.250
 Important is the baking paper 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.870
 people's insanity insanity that 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.600
 Baking paper is so important I want 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.730
 take and then find angles here 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:41.310
 There is ice and snow in winter 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.240
 But it is also possible to delete one 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:48.000
 is important virtual daughter does so 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:49.950
 high because that's the height 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.360
 we are left then going on or it 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:56.040
 nothing would be baked then we will go 

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.050
 Just drop us off in the fridge and 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:00.269
 We green it for at least two hours 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.600
 well by succumbing we just get out 

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:05.640
 The whole thing falls and yes pretty much 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.670
 Baking paper I already is dissolves 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.690
 really good but it is wonderful and 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:13.890
 now you just have to do it 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.180
 cut into small snacks with it 

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.630
 It is also a bit appealing 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.290
 looks 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.510
 which is not exactly advised 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.490
 just rising so could love so much 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.740
 just in the whole something a bit natural 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.960
 shit change on the side 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.479
 that's practical and says 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.460
 try to say my son 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:34.229
 and yes we just make it here 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:36.900
 Some consumers do not do anything like that 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:37.680
 small dice raus out right 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.720
 endure 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.750
 makes longer what can cut there 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.270
 are not tactical of creativity 

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.500
 borders 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:47.729
 yes I have mine so completely mine 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.160
 Music has to be said 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.169
 I always pretty much see that 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.789
 is solved 

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:56.130
 and if my fans are so specific 

00:04:53.789 --> 00:04:59.070
 I think so, too 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:05:00.030
 always no bigger, so wonderful 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:04.259
 cut together 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:05.880
 then try it is wrong 

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:08.009
 finished the pictures you saw 

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:11.479
 or you are currently the question you are 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.479
 by donating that first 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:30.499
 a pleasure 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:38.270
 what a treat you have to admit 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:39.830
 Orior is ok with that 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:50.990
 low in calories, it is not the must go to 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:51.590
 But I should definitely go 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.779
 try out 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.870
 So off in the kitchen makes in yours 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:55.870
 own 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.860
 then you will be up to 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.860
 next time 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.229
 mobile 

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.530
 not 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.879
 the
