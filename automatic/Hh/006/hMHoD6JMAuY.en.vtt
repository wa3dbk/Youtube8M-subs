great<00:01:58.189> bail<00:01:59.189> system<00:01:59.570> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.689> see<00:02:00.840> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
great bail system you can see the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.139 
great bail system you can see the
friction<00:02:01.320> trip<00:02:01.560> there<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:02.369> is<00:02:02.549> designed<00:02:02.880> so

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
friction trip there this is designed so

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.120 
friction trip there this is designed so
that<00:02:03.180> one<00:02:03.509> when<00:02:03.810> this<00:02:03.930> bail<00:02:04.170> is<00:02:04.350> open<00:02:04.680> no

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
that one when this bail is open no

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.499 
that one when this bail is open no
matter<00:02:05.310> how<00:02:05.520> hard<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.850> try<00:02:06.090> to<00:02:06.149> flip<00:02:06.390> this

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509

bail<00:02:06.750> over<00:02:06.930> it's<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.560> flip<00:02:07.770> which

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bail over it's not going to flip which

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.529 
bail over it's not going to flip which
is<00:02:08.520> great<00:02:08.700> that's<00:02:08.849> why<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.090> got<00:02:09.179> sort<00:02:09.390> of<00:02:09.420> that

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
is great that's why you got sort of that

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.110 
is great that's why you got sort of that
slow<00:02:09.959> slow<00:02:10.770> retrieve<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.280> actually<00:02:11.520> slows<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
slow slow retrieve it actually slows you

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.040 
slow slow retrieve it actually slows you
down

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
down

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.190 
down
it<00:02:13.200> doesn't<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.640> trip<00:02:14.640> over<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.390> again

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it doesn't just trip over on you again

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.920 
it doesn't just trip over on you again
you<00:02:16.320> get<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.440> fish<00:02:16.650> this<00:02:16.770> reel<00:02:16.980> with<00:02:17.130> braid<00:02:17.930> 580

these<00:02:33.510> bigger<00:02:33.690> reels<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.020> gets<00:02:34.140> a<00:02:34.170> little<00:02:34.260> bit

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
these bigger reels it gets a little bit

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:35.570 
these bigger reels it gets a little bit
harder<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.650> make<00:02:34.860> them<00:02:34.950> smooth<00:02:35.220> I<00:02:35.280> don't<00:02:35.430> think

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
harder to make them smooth I don't think

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.220 
harder to make them smooth I don't think
that's<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:35.910> what<00:02:36.030> Penn<00:02:36.240> was<00:02:36.390> Amy<00:02:36.540> for<00:02:36.810> you

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
that's really what Penn was Amy for you

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
know there anything to create a reel

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.920 
know there anything to create a reel
that<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:39.060> can<00:02:39.180> catch<00:02:39.330> a<00:02:39.450> really<00:02:39.660> big<00:02:39.780> fish

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930

that you can catch a really big fish
with<00:02:40.410> that's<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.880> know<00:02:42.000> relatively

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
with that's you know relatively

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.240 
with that's you know relatively
inexpensive<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.140> mean<00:02:43.260> $200<00:02:43.830> for<00:02:43.980> an<00:02:44.100> offshore

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
inexpensive I mean $200 for an offshore

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.910 
inexpensive I mean $200 for an offshore
reel<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:44.910> this<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.300> really<00:02:46.260> inexpensive<00:02:46.470> as

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
reel like this is really inexpensive as

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.490 
reel like this is really inexpensive as
far<00:02:47.100> as<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.880> market<00:02:48.240> goes<00:02:48.360> four<00:02:49.050> point<00:02:49.260> two<00:02:49.410> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
far as the market goes four point two to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.150 
far as the market goes four point two to
1<00:02:49.650> gear<00:02:49.860> ratio<00:02:49.970> which<00:02:50.970> is<00:02:51.150> similar<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.510> all<00:02:51.780> the

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
1 gear ratio which is similar to all the

1 gear ratio which is similar to all the
you<00:02:53.160> know<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:53.430> large<00:02:53.640> offshore<00:02:53.940> reels<00:02:54.690> like

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
you know the large offshore reels like

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.920 
you know the large offshore reels like
Stella<00:02:55.350> 20,000<00:02:56.070> and<00:02:56.570> you<00:02:57.570> know<00:02:57.660> I<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:57.870> the

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
Stella 20,000 and you know I think the

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.760 
Stella 20,000 and you know I think the
accurate<00:02:58.320> is<00:02:58.710> a<00:02:58.740> six<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.130> one<00:02:59.250> but<00:03:00.770> it's

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:01.770 
accurate is a six to one but it's

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:05.360 
accurate is a six to one but it's
definitely<00:03:02.010> a<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:03.590> ginormous<00:03:04.590> reel<00:03:04.890> it's<00:03:05.190> it's

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
definitely a a ginormous reel it's it's
