this<00:03:18.079> is<00:03:18.260> just<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.620> recap<00:03:18.980> all<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:19.489> stuff<00:03:19.700> i

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
this is just a recap all the stuff i

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.569 
this is just a recap all the stuff i
carried<00:03:20.180> in<00:03:20.299> there<00:03:20.560> now<00:03:21.560> I<00:03:21.889> would<00:03:22.220> have<00:03:22.340> put

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
carried in there now I would have put

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:24.220 
carried in there now I would have put
these<00:03:22.819> sunglasses<00:03:23.120> in<00:03:23.690> because<00:03:23.989> i<00:03:24.079> usually

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
these sunglasses in because i usually

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.759 
these sunglasses in because i usually
wear<00:03:24.530> these<00:03:25.630> but<00:03:26.630> it<00:03:26.750> didn't<00:03:27.049> fit<00:03:27.380> in<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.620> back

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
wear these but it didn't fit in the back

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:29.740 
wear these but it didn't fit in the back
just<00:03:27.980> because<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:28.459> shape<00:03:28.790> of<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.060> casing<00:03:29.660> is

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:29.750 
just because the shape of the casing is

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.129 
just because the shape of the casing is
so<00:03:29.989> weird<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.680> odd<00:03:30.950> and<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.519> it<00:03:31.970> fit<00:03:32.810> in<00:03:32.989> the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
so weird and odd and just it fit in the

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:34.900 
so weird and odd and just it fit in the
bag<00:03:33.319> so<00:03:33.739> if<00:03:33.889> you<00:03:34.040> didn't<00:03:34.250> want<00:03:34.400> to<00:03:34.459> close<00:03:34.700> it

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:34.910 
bag so if you didn't want to close it

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.120 
bag so if you didn't want to close it
then<00:03:35.090> it<00:03:35.209> was<00:03:35.329> a<00:03:35.359> fit<00:03:35.569> fine<00:03:35.870> but<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.950> just

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.130 
then it was a fit fine but it just

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.390 
then it was a fit fine but it just
wouldn't<00:03:37.609> zip<00:03:37.970> up<00:03:38.180> all<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.930> way<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.440> when<00:03:40.370> I

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:40.400 
wouldn't zip up all the way and when I

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.089 
wouldn't zip up all the way and when I
did<00:03:40.519> get<00:03:40.880> it<00:03:41.000> to<00:03:41.090> zip<00:03:41.269> up<00:03:41.359> in<00:03:41.540> me<00:03:41.720> like<00:03:41.959> this<00:03:42.099> the

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
did get it to zip up in me like this the

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.860 
did get it to zip up in me like this the
zipper<00:03:43.459> look<00:03:43.700> all<00:03:43.849> funny<00:03:44.090> and<00:03:44.239> stretched<00:03:44.660> out

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
zipper look all funny and stretched out

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.409 
zipper look all funny and stretched out
and<00:03:45.019> I<00:03:45.109> didn't<00:03:45.319> like<00:03:45.440> that<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.730> what<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.329> would

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
and I didn't like that so what I would

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:49.300 
and I didn't like that so what I would
suggest<00:03:47.569> is<00:03:47.900> maybe<00:03:47.930> get<00:03:48.380> like<00:03:48.560> she<00:03:49.160> has

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
suggest is maybe get like she has

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.640 
suggest is maybe get like she has
sunglasses<00:03:49.489> at<00:03:49.940> the<00:03:50.120> casing<00:03:50.629> isn't<00:03:50.810> as<00:03:51.109> crazy

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:51.650 
sunglasses at the casing isn't as crazy

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:54.909 
sunglasses at the casing isn't as crazy
and<00:03:52.310> that<00:03:52.730> would<00:03:52.910> work<00:03:53.120> um<00:03:53.810> maybe<00:03:54.500> a<00:03:54.650> thinner

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:54.919 
and that would work um maybe a thinner

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:57.280 
and that would work um maybe a thinner
casing<00:03:55.459> would<00:03:55.579> work<00:03:55.730> better<00:03:55.940> or<00:03:56.239> you<00:03:56.959> can<00:03:57.139> just

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
casing would work better or you can just

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:58.900 
casing would work better or you can just
not<00:03:57.500> carry<00:03:57.859> the<00:03:57.980> water<00:03:58.129> bottle<00:03:58.519> and<00:03:58.669> carry

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
not carry the water bottle and carry

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.890 
not carry the water bottle and carry
sunglasses<00:03:59.450> and<00:03:59.629> that<00:03:59.750> might<00:03:59.930> help<00:04:00.910> um<00:04:01.910> yeah

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
sunglasses and that might help um yeah

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.689 
sunglasses and that might help um yeah
