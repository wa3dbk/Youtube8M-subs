00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hi, I'm going to explain how to make a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:10.100
 downgrade of geely beam 4.1.2 ice cream 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.780
 sanwich four points 0.4 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:15.620
 in this process they will need the 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:18.200
 chain of rice ice cream sanwich goes 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.460
 to need this folder to leave the 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.460
 link in the link 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.670
 in the video description link 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:32.850
 and now they're going to have to install the 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.340
 smartphone drivers that what 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.400
 can do installing the application on 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.200
 gps suite 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.079
 will install all the drivers 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.289
 that they will need 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:47.589
 then they will go to your phone and 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.420
 they are going to put or they will go into adjustments 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:52.210
 of the developer options system and 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.429
 they will enable usb debugging too 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.829
 they will enter system settings 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:00.329
 again in security and enable 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.329
 Unknown origins 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:07.330
 the next step is to turn off the phone 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.140
 keep the volume key pressed - and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.210
 connect it to the pc with the usb cable by 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.790
 supposed 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.790
 this is going to take us to sw mode 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.370
 and now we are going to use this folder 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.650
 that they speak to him and they are going to execute 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.580
 automatic offline presidium 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.580
 they give him to accept 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.160
 to accept 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.160
 good for instructions 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.840
 accept this was little window 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.840
 yes 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:55.320
 and with this program they will see what it says 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.470
 select and they will leave how are you 3 g7 in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.450
 formaldehyde to emerge if they are going to 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.720
 select the z of zeta that I have in the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.820
 desk that the k of z 2010 that 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.820
 corresponds to screen sandwich 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.140
 they are going to click on the button that says 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:13.810
 normal web 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.810
 greatest 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.810
 then they go to click Greystar 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:25.850
 to click on font software update 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.850
 reich stream 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.830
 in accept 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:34.020
 against and they will put different with 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:37.110
 trini in language man to put Spanish 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.870
 and they give ok is going to start the process myself 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.990
 I'm going to cancel it because I do not want it 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.990
 do 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:50.000
 this will take 5 to 10 minutes and 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.000
 they are going to have installed 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.910
 rum ice cream sanwich a clarification that 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:04.300
 I want to do is that by restarting the 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:07.420
 phone can get stuck in it 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.640
 in the Chinese logo this would be a semi 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.220
 brightness since the bootloader is 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.340
 locked 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:16.340
 what they should do is a hard reset 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.819
 they do it by squeezing 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:24.630
 keeping the three keys pressed 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.240
 on volume - and home 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.150
 hold them together will receive the 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:35.610
 jean logo when it appears later 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:37.680
 of the logo this the android logo go to 

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:41.070
 let go and they'll expect me to do all the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:45.200
 process with this should already have their 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:47.629
 white cream sanwich install 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.060
 one last clarification that this is run 

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.020
 at each one's risk so I do not do 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.440
 responsable 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:58.580
 if they can not get out of that he 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.530
 from that lock screen and from there 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:05.280
 doing hard reset goals like 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.550
 I would recommend reloading 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.690
 billy beane that the one I had and go back to 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:14.270
 try again to see yes 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:17.030
 at the second opportunity they can 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:17.630
 install ice cream sandwich well that's 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.320
 all 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.450
 I hope that 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.450
 it will be useful until the next
