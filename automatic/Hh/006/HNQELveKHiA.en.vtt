00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.680
 and accompanying the development of 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:36.879
 played 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:42.500
 the blinds being that are considered the 

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:44.390
 initial thump the heise the tribeca 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.580
 we arrive at the tool one 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.110
 extremely used tool today 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.589
 which is what was beth can they and value or 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:58.370
 light was also beth by value is 

00:00:54.589 --> 00:01:02.930
 very simple is you have that hand 1 1 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:06.140
 thousand by two you give the initial king take 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:10.010
 the holder Tibet and if it really is 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.130
 bete is going to be just that re 

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:15.080
 and if indeed the value 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.830
 this is nothing but the beige that is 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.900
 the fourth bet was beth light nothing more 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.149
 It's what we understand. 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.439
 happening at the table, for example, I'm 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:27.350
 opening many hands 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:29.689
 I opened the king and I took the tribeca in 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.939
 result of this loose game in 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:34.460
 and that my income 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.719
 quite wide my opponent will know 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.820
 of this he will be able to understand 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.070
 precisely by analyzing the number of mothers 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.369
 I'm playing so I'm very 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.500
 able to take that beckett light that 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:48.109
 People just said that it's a tibet. 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 precisely because of the situation what will open 

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:54.409
 margin that will open the door for us 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.500
 apply this fabet light that is the people 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:02:00.679
 understand exactly the situation understand 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.689
 that what the villain is just coming back to 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.159
 people are just imitating people in 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:06.109
 due to the number of deaths that the 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.270
 people look at the image that 

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:10.310
 We are going to the table then the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.140
 people is passing this image is a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.540
 perfect sport when we take a 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.340
 tibet apply an ice cream light you 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.470
 make an impression that even if you 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.300
 Do not have anything at the moment. 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.760
 knowing that the player is also with 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:25.100
 a hand not too strong you will 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.900
 take advantage of this situation 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.330
 cause of this meta game that we will 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.720
 talk a lot is you understand what the 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.210
 other 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.420
 're thinking before the image you 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.220
 is playing on the table 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.290
 she was continuing in the part of 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.980
 tools after the rocket was beth 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.800

 and vb net light and all this goes 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.940
 following this logic of this 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.930
 reasoning does not have much secret is 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.930
 basically this 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.219
