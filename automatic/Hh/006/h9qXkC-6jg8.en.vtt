thought<00:01:16.409> this<00:01:16.619> is<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.860> easiest<00:01:17.220> elevator

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
thought this is the easiest elevator

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.910 
thought this is the easiest elevator

just do this and again on survival guys
it's<00:01:22.350> actually<00:01:22.710> pretty<00:01:22.920> easy<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.369> just<00:01:23.400> go<00:01:23.820> in

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
it's actually pretty easy you just go in

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.270 
it's actually pretty easy you just go in
and<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.229> make<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.590> as<00:01:25.710> you<00:01:25.860> jump<00:01:26.070> up

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
