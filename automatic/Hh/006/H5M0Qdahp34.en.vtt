00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.740
 a savory pie an olive and salmon 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.630

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.360
 quite cold or warm as 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.360
 second 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.059
 let's see the ingredients we have of the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.970

 of chicory for decoration 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.120
 Let's start by browning the fresh salmon 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.900
 cut into small pieces with a little butter 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.580
 inside the flat pana canc e 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.379
 we cook in combined mode for 4 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.190
 minutes and since the salmon is not 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.809
 lot 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.809
 we choose the power 2 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.810
 while the salmon is rolling 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.070
 inside the oven we start the flour 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.340

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.340

 browning of the finished salmon and 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.420
 so now we take it out of the oven 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.619
 to be another bowl we land the 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:32.920
 three eggs with a little milk and some 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:34.210
 oil we also add a little salt a 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.009
 bit of pepper 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.880
 now we combine the beaten eggs with the 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.880
 flour and parmesan 

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:45.149

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.080

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.229
 strips and while we're at it 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.229
 we adjust a little salt 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.740
 if too much we can now add a 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.740
 bit of milk 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.560
