00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.800
 and he called me soul 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.700
 with the girls I'm just going to teach that 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:18.310
 more than waiting when you hear 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:23.390
 they are basically moody's and well we are going to 

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:27.560
 proceed to the steps and 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.470
 we have a plastic hair pot with 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.020
 its effect at the moment if you do not want 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:35.600
 normal sticks and large chopsticks 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:38.200
 these skewers breadcrumbs and 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.890
 renovation so that they make weight 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:44.770
 and paper that with or do not want napkins 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:47.920
 to govern and I bought you're rumble 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.520
 white because they looked for me more and 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.309
 more clouds this ribbon to decorate then 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.070
 with big scissors and 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.800
 our ball that will make the signature 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:02.580
 from the tree we add the chickpeas for 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.580
 to make weight 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:13.219
 and then the excellent bread crumbs 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:16.100
 and the last one is a little bit of water to 

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:19.670
 that a mixture was made as a paste 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.650
 and will better support the kilo we had 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.630
 of clouds above 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.920
 let's take some chopsticks 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.799
 these big skewer 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.960
 we are going to unite with the zeal so that 

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.960
 we remove the process 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.380
 since we have it we are going to see where 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.860
 let's put the chopsticks 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.860
 grandmothers 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.570
 and we are going to proceed to make a space for 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.490
 what 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.490
 it is better 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.950
 and I buy it 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.530
 now let's put the sky upside down 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.890
 so that it sticks on this colored ribbon 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:13.300
 green or if you want with glue to 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:16.810
 same place plus the idea of zeal 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.010
 and we are putting our color ribbon 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:22.110
 of which you want in my case is green 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.940
 future 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.220
 and once we have it you can put 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.590
 a piece of heat in the extremities 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.000
 so that it stays well attached and does not 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.690
 saves 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.550
 let's try how we would put it 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.550
 and if all the measures are right 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:49.170
 and that is how we are left and we are going to cover 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.879
 with paper the whole ball is transparent 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.159
 to make it more hygienic and we're going to 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.590
 fill the green one by one and it's 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.709
 our result I hope that I have 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.389
 liked the paper that they put then I put him 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.030
 over so you do not see the mixture 

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.780
 what we did with 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:04.780
 the breadcrumbs 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.420
 and well, girls, I hope that I have 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.680
 liked and until next time 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:11.680
 I love you bye
