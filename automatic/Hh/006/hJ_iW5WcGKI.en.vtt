00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.909
 but not 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.909
 3 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.780
 previously the rebel magician had already 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.010
 been where to see die but that was 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.930
 before you make the change 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:19.360
 mechanical the root of now is pretty 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.070
 different and it's causing a lot of pain 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.390
 many think that this 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.310
 dow energy and there's no need 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.700
 worry but I have checked myself 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.040
 that rise is very ope and must surely 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:32.110
 dying to beat this rise is easy 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.030
 Well the points that will help you are 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.370
 very concrete the first thing that you should 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.290
 understand struggling against a raise is your 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.450
 passive if you watched the combo video 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.860
 root you will have everything more clear if you do not 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.810
 have you seen you can click on the image 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.850
 that is showing up right now for 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.220
 that you can see the root passive is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.960
 the key to everything very hard you can 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.120
 win a raise in an exchange of 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.340
 damage if he himself uses his combo well and 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.140
 it tackles you at the right time so 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.120
 you must avoid fighting with him in those 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.460
 moments to identify the moments 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.350
 key is very easy while more charges 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.180
 have raised more dangerous will be a 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.729
 Under no circumstances exchange with him 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 you start an exchange if you have four 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.720
 loads even if your jungle is with you 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.910
 since the amount of damage and the shield 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.100
 they will smash the weakest and you will not 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.810
 want to give him not a single one here remember 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.970
 that you can see the charges around 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.250
 I struggled with it on the floor 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.350
 have 0 1 or 2 loads the damage that will make you 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.420
 It will be very low because its cooling does not 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.740
 will be enough that's the advantage that 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.930
 you must always and never take advantage 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.030
 forget it another small tip that you should 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.280
 to know is that the root early game is 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.320
 very bad not for the damage but for the mana 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.000
 raise spend a lot of mana and you'll see that 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.890
 it will be needed so use this your favor 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.170
 initiates exchanges in the first three 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.790
 levels to make it spend mana mana 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.590
 of making it very difficult to grow 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.050
 the first few minutes of the game and you can 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.640
 control it the whole game basically 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.840
 these two tips will be to have them under 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.640
 control 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.470
 surely you also have tips 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.940
 teachers to fight against the 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.950
