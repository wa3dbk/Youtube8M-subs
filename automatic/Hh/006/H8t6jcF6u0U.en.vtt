00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:16.880
 the topic that I have is to put them this day 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:18.890
 is the cultivation of the crop and 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.919
 industrialization of stevia 

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:24.160
 for the development of communities 

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:26.289
 rural marginalized 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.770
 I propose this product because I 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:32.650
 I know what you live in what you lived in 

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.450
 those places without opportunities without 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.660
 jobs imagine what it is that can 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.879
 to be the people I come from there I had a lot 

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.460
 lucky to have studied for that reason 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.650
 I think the cultivation of stevia is a 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.340
 great opportunity to be given 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.960
 jobs people can pass it on 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.809
 dads can send a boy to the 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 school and they can have a life 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.360
 worthy I think that with one hectare they would have 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.000
 a small family to develop and 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.479
 I think we can have years 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.240
 working with the project the stevia is 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.850
 a plant approximately 80 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.290
 centimeters height originally from 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 Paraguay and Brazil on that border 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.210
 and it has a lot of sweetening power 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.430
 many times more than sugar like 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.220
 example I can tell you that 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.130
 the powder of stevia leaves with a large 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.440
 hole in sweet a liter of water and with the 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.780
 refined sugar in these nine grams 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.200
 with that I think it's enough but 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:39.220
 has the plus of not having zero calories 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.850
 calories in addition to having properties 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:45.730
 medicinal as antibacterial anti 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.730
 fungus that would help us to put 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:51.490
 the pastas as some countries do 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:55.420
 as Brazil and as they do also in 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:59.860
 in japan in japan more than 50% of the 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:03.130
 population uses stevia as sugar 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.520
 and it tells you is forbidden 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.920
 Introduction to manufacturing 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:12.610
 artificial sweeteners I think that 

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:16.480
 they are doing things very well the 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.810
 stevia the objective is to cultivate it in those 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.650
 communities with one hectare per family 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:27.430
 in organized groups of 10 in 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.410
 rural societies with the production 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.530
 rural so that they have 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.620
 financing by the government 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.080
 the cultivation of this chutzpah costs 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.910
 around 300 thousand pesos one hectare 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.520
 but in the way we 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.280
 we propose only you will come out in 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.220
 some 25 thousand pesos because the most expensive 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.430
 They are plants and is of Agrobiológicas 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.739
 Seve has developed the technology of 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:56.450
 multiplication of plants where 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.880
 we lower the technology that is in the 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.640
 clouds and we put it in the hands of 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:03.110
 the children of the ejidatarios I think that 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.480
 they make very interesting because those people 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:08.000
 does not have opportunities to have 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.650
 technological products but I think that 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.239
 under the guidance of people who are 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.180
 interested as we are in what 

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:17.000
 have is going to come true we have 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.910
 said that this project is going to be a 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.310
 sign though, but it's going to be 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.250
 already started, we have talks 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.000
 with many people from the sierra 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.280
 primarily it is not found 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.660
 marginalized communities and they are very 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.870
 posts I even have some calls 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:36.290
 right now they are set for seven 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.570
 detonate the project this project in the 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.500
 Today we have many 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.170
 advances 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.300
 we think we have 90 percent 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.810
 we have greenhouses that we have 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:50.450
 built in some way greenhouses 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.360
 blue because blue because the color 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.160
 blue that are researchers also from 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.080
 biology controls diseases and 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:59.990
 controls pests 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:01.820
 that's something important besides the cultivation 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:05.470
 and we want to be organic so that 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.410
 have a plus and is worth twice as much 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:12.560
 international market now raises 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.200
 the industry so that the 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.419
 farmers do not have the need to 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.060
 be exporting the product to places 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.650
 very far away, but right here where 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:25.100
 you can pay the price 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.470
 internationally, I think it's a 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.650
 great project that would come to solve 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.140
 many of the current problems of 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.150
 crime because crime does not 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.010
 it happens because people are delinquent 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:38.630
 lalín cuencia leaves because it's missing 

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:40.790
 job opportunity and to go to the 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:43.250
 school we closed the door to the 'u' 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.460
 of the university and we open the 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:49.190
 prison doors 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:51.080
 I believe that as long as we have a 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.270
 little sensitivity we will solve 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.340
 that problem that problem not only 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.710
 in government it is also from us 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:00.050
 citizens mainly of 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.539
 we the ones that we want that 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.139
 things are solved and I think what 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:08.849
 let's do 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:11.770
 because stevia is a solution for this 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.770
 and I shook his hand 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.770
 Thank you 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:28.600
 I talked about the project in the field 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.870
 question is whether the list is already 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.720
 part of industrialization of the study 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:37.150
 look with this I will answer if I 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:38.979
 I take the first place I assure you that in 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.410
 I'm going to be selling this one 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:43.690
 well that of the supermarkets and in a 

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:46.120
 lots of places and we're going to have the 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.820
 stevia samples in each of the 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.490
 highland communities such as the 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:55.180
 that the selected rumba variety will go 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.600
 watteau there are many communities that 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:06:02.620
 they need to be networks and they have water 

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:04.300
 rumba with room in san ignacio and east by 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:06.280
 concord for all those roads and 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:08.470
 many communities and we also have 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.139
 very appropriate climate in the rosary and 

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:14.410
 concord concord on the coast too 

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.139
 in some communities of the municipality of 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.259
 culiacán 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:20.599
 you have already identified the 

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:23.370
 significance then we have 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:25.590
 identified we have papers of each 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.620
 of the participants with their 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.539
 parcel certificates with everything and the 

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.669
 willingness to carry out the 

00:06:30.539 --> 00:06:34.199
 project the part of the 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:36.389
 industrialization has the 

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:39.150
 technology we definitely have 

00:06:36.389 --> 00:06:41.939
 we have the process ready and that is 

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:45.469
 organic in addition so that you have 

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:45.469
 that plus in the international market 

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:49.480
 not only do we want in the 

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:52.150
 industry we also want to teach you to 

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:53.710
 people to do some process to 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:56.770
 that they too from their community 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:59.080
 they can put an added value that 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:02.410
 they can do they can sell 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:05.100
 dried leaves in powder and can do 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:07.560
 extracts 

00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:10.620
 we have to put them in a process of 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:13.140
 organic agriculture where we have 

00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.080
 that we go to certify so that they 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:18.960
 follow those regulations and can meet 

00:07:16.080 --> 00:07:22.020
 with all requirements and may have more 

00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:24.660
 income for your family how many 

00:07:22.020 --> 00:07:27.000
 hectares already have and asia how many more and 

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:29.460
 I have sectaries 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:34.350
 we want to expand in the first year to 

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:36.690
 100 to 100 hectares now as I told you 

00:07:34.350 --> 00:07:40.050
 the hectare will not go out to them in 300,000 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:42.210
 it's going to come out in 25 thousand 30 thousand because 

00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:46.880
 we are going to give you the technology as 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.880
 why are you going to give us the prize 

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:57.040
 we are going to have 100 families to start 

00:07:53.140 --> 00:08:00.250
 but he was elevated tracking 

00:07:57.040 --> 00:08:02.980
 they are going to give courses they are going to be 

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:06.040
 giving practical courses so that they 

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:08.590
 carried out in the field and by 

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:12.000
 the doctor is going to give soriano him 

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:12.000
 we appreciate your participation
