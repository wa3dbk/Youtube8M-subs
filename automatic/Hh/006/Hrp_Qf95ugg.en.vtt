00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
manager had to override the price of

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.870 
manager had to override the price of
zero<00:02:19.050> the<00:02:20.040> kicker<00:02:20.250> couldn't<00:02:20.640> do<00:02:20.730> it<00:02:20.790> by

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
zero the kicker couldn't do it by

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.520 
zero the kicker couldn't do it by
herself<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.390> if<00:02:21.570> you<00:02:21.690> went<00:02:21.870> into<00:02:22.050> that<00:02:22.170> you
