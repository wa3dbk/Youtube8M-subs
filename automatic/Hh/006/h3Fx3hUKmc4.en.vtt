00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:10.289
 what I do 

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.289
 out of bounds and bring on the forum 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.199
 it's both of the season the latest version to come out of its 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.199
 torpor 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 several similar episodes 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.120
 their cost by Jewish settlers is to introduce you 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.020
 lukaku of attac 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.020
 since the now well-known attacks that followed 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.250
 no cause of origin here nokia I lived well as peeling paint 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.250
 paul 

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.410
 but speech in front will see so his engine of the coup in the camp of hamas he 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.880
 will still perfectly needs 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.859
 So here we are talking about the cost of impact studies 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.520
 bellegarde the big novelty of silverlight 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.960
 for this beginning of the year 2008 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.380
 all 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.520
 of the shot 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.740
 with that by 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.250
 and first of all about how 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.250
 so when you can see the 7th and a bit particular 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.690
 because the price of the apartment 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.120
 the palm in China two shots under the 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.290
 right left 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.050
 this ascent descent with a blockage 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.900
 what is a nantes toulouse 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.300
 of course the liver of the frequency 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.140
 power 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.220
 but it takes a high commander 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.590
 in fact very particular because in its lower part and well everything 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.830
 simply 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.580
 it serves as greatness if we can say 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.900
 well at peak august 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.870
 look at it happened 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.810
 extraordinary as finds 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.680
 it allows me in the votes our savings that it goes tiny 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.420
 everywhere you want it without the risk of damaging it it goes into a 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.380
 backpack or in a satchel anything 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.690
 really very easily 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.750
 in this accommodation find the logo that sew 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.300
 eric soares 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.840
 that's the beta then 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.590
 at first glance like that it looks a lot like flowing in the veins 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.569
 the only thing that will differentiate you will see 

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.509
 we can see here the difference between the two models 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.759
 they are in the same plane so that the play-off are comparable 

00:02:25.429 --> 00:02:27.839
 you can see 

00:02:27.839 --> 00:02:30.669
 the whip it could use 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:32.629
 eriksson is the new 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:36.099
 30% smaller than the old model 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:39.529
 it is also more there necessarily it is always in mode ppp or polystyrene 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.239
 knowledgeable people and museums as much to anyone as the previous 

00:02:44.559 --> 00:02:49.529
 the school possesses like its rigid wing that just left the college under 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:50.289
 voltage 

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:54.949
 the postponement of the plot seems a lot like the former ambassador of norway 

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:55.929
 the shelled 

00:02:55.929 --> 00:02:58.239
 leading the car rally 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.120
 but not he told me to go do it 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.149
 moreover the pivot a priori if not more 

00:03:04.149 --> 00:03:08.280
 I wish that according to m 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.549
 it is still too early to judge his judgment 

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:16.930
 only I arrived here 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.840
 I'm just happy to know how 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.559
 we survive 

00:03:21.559 --> 00:03:35.819
 on his side franÃ§ois fillon antilles without it is the door open to 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.579
 marseille south korean pro 36 

00:03:40.279 --> 00:03:43.939
 his death intervenes alros has backtracked and I'm proud to represent 

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.939
 the world its role 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:59.719
 this will save when previewing the little younes if 

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:01.289
 you have the choice 

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:04.819
 alexandre orlando hastings and in themselves marketed also to 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:05.989
 ballast 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:09.629
 for now pretty much to its novelty what can you present 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.019
 but it's decadence another novelty 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.090
 go until the end 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:15.499
 bigger this time 

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:18.739
 always dreamed of listening but who should have an extra voice 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.739
 and therefore that make it much more controllable 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.279
 this passion obviously much more moderate 

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:28.699
 especially people who buy that sell like toys 

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.499
 because it may come 

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:32.920
 a little later the pilot and no longer like a lot more 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:35.830
 more maneuverable 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.040
 still is it a new record on me delphine which 12 

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:41.120
 centimeters in diameter of the NATO 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.910
 and something like 6 of android so that we still have to beat by the 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:48.030
 dedicated but they are rare and then again innovative will go into 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.080
 Guinness Book of Records 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.729
 it will be officially presented it will agree blair between February 7 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.110
 we will obviously be the ones we can perhaps give us 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.210
 more information 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.139
 thank you cake and they are many to discover his art
