is one of the unfinished tubs you can
see<00:02:59.049> a<00:02:59.079> bit<00:02:59.319> of<00:02:59.470> this<00:02:59.859> is<00:03:00.040> the<00:03:00.250> acrylic<00:03:00.700> that

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
see a bit of this is the acrylic that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.819 
see a bit of this is the acrylic that
we're<00:03:01.209> gonna<00:03:01.299> put<00:03:01.599> in<00:03:01.780> here<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.260> window

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
we're gonna put in here in the window

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:05.160 
we're gonna put in here in the window
my<00:03:03.310> dad<00:03:03.489> has<00:03:03.670> got<00:03:03.909> a<00:03:03.939> little<00:03:04.269> low<00:03:04.659> window<00:03:04.959> cut

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
my dad has got a little low window cut

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.959 
my dad has got a little low window cut
out<00:03:05.260> your<00:03:05.470> where<00:03:05.620> the<00:03:05.709> clicks<00:03:06.040> gonna<00:03:06.250> go<00:03:06.489> so<00:03:06.819> we

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:06.969 
out your where the clicks gonna go so we

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:09.929 
out your where the clicks gonna go so we
can<00:03:07.180> just<00:03:07.329> look<00:03:08.079> in<00:03:08.319> and<00:03:08.680> check<00:03:09.430> out<00:03:09.609> where<00:03:09.819> the

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939 
can just look in and check out where the

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:11.759 
can just look in and check out where the
snakes<00:03:10.180> are<00:03:10.420> what<00:03:10.870> they're<00:03:11.019> doing<00:03:11.319> and<00:03:11.560> stuff

00:03:11.759 --> 00:03:11.769 
snakes are what they're doing and stuff

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:14.339 
snakes are what they're doing and stuff
and<00:03:12.389> he's<00:03:13.389> drilled<00:03:13.659> some<00:03:13.840> holes<00:03:13.870> right<00:03:14.290> here

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:14.349 
and he's drilled some holes right here

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:17.490 
and he's drilled some holes right here
for<00:03:14.680> ventilation<00:03:15.269> in<00:03:16.269> the<00:03:16.870> side<00:03:17.049> of<00:03:17.079> the<00:03:17.230> tubs

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
for ventilation in the side of the tubs

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.099 
for ventilation in the side of the tubs
and<00:03:18.419> you<00:03:19.419> can<00:03:19.599> see<00:03:21.060> the<00:03:22.060> tubs<00:03:22.299> are<00:03:22.480> not<00:03:22.689> fit

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:23.109 
and you can see the tubs are not fit

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.250 
and you can see the tubs are not fit
tightly<00:03:23.439> either<00:03:23.799> to<00:03:24.370> top<00:03:25.329> layer<00:03:25.540> so<00:03:26.019> there's

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
tightly either to top layer so there's

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.809 
tightly either to top layer so there's
actually<00:03:26.620> a<00:03:26.650> little<00:03:26.919> bit<00:03:27.069> of<00:03:27.189> a<00:03:27.280> gap<00:03:27.549> right

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:27.819 
actually a little bit of a gap right

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.170 
actually a little bit of a gap right
here<00:03:28.540> as<00:03:28.659> well<00:03:28.870> for<00:03:28.989> ventilation<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:31.030> the

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
here as well for ventilation so the

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.909 
here as well for ventilation so the
snakes<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.659> actually<00:03:31.959> very<00:03:32.169> comfortable<00:03:32.739> and

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
snakes are actually very comfortable and

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:35.699 
snakes are actually very comfortable and
you<00:03:33.069> can<00:03:33.220> breathe<00:03:33.430> very<00:03:33.489> well<00:03:33.879> in<00:03:34.750> the<00:03:35.500> rack

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
you can breathe very well in the rack

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.789 
you can breathe very well in the rack
and<00:03:36.720> right<00:03:37.720> here<00:03:37.900> in<00:03:38.019> Malaysia<00:03:38.260> it's<00:03:38.560> very

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:38.799 
and right here in Malaysia it's very

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:40.949 
and right here in Malaysia it's very
warm<00:03:39.129> we<00:03:39.370> have<00:03:39.639> an<00:03:39.909> average<00:03:40.359> temperature<00:03:40.540> of

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
warm we have an average temperature of

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.930 
warm we have an average temperature of
90<00:03:41.349> degrees<00:03:41.709> anyways<00:03:42.190> throughout<00:03:42.579> the<00:03:42.699> year

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
90 degrees anyways throughout the year

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:48.110 
90 degrees anyways throughout the year
so<00:03:43.569> no<00:03:43.870> heating<00:03:44.139> equipment<00:03:44.470> is<00:03:44.829> necessary<00:03:45.989> and

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
so no heating equipment is necessary and

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.420 
so no heating equipment is necessary and
yeah<00:03:49.120> why<00:03:49.449> we<00:03:49.720> picked<00:03:49.989> black<00:03:50.560> tubs<00:03:50.859> is<00:03:51.069> because

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:51.430 
yeah why we picked black tubs is because

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.360 
yeah why we picked black tubs is because
snakes<00:03:52.299> they<00:03:52.810> would<00:03:52.959> generally<00:03:53.470> feel<00:03:53.709> safer

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
snakes they would generally feel safer

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.909 
snakes they would generally feel safer
in<00:03:54.609> black<00:03:55.030> tops<00:03:55.329> and<00:03:55.659> you<00:03:56.199> know<00:03:56.319> it<00:03:56.500> gives<00:03:56.709> them

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:56.919 
in black tops and you know it gives them

00:03:56.919 --> 00:03:59.580 
in black tops and you know it gives them
that<00:03:57.159> the<00:03:57.699> feeling<00:03:58.060> of<00:03:58.180> a<00:03:58.540> better<00:03:59.109> sense<00:03:59.440> of

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
that the feeling of a better sense of

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.610 
that the feeling of a better sense of
security<00:04:00.750> compared<00:04:01.750> to<00:04:01.930> a<00:04:01.959> white<00:04:02.229> enclosure

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:02.620 
security compared to a white enclosure

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:04.920 
security compared to a white enclosure
and<00:04:03.220> also<00:04:03.760> I<00:04:03.790> think<00:04:03.909> black<00:04:04.269> tops<00:04:04.510> look<00:04:04.690> pretty

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
and also I think black tops look pretty

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.259 
and also I think black tops look pretty
cool<00:04:05.169> don't<00:04:05.349> you<00:04:05.530> think<00:04:05.760> I've<00:04:06.760> got<00:04:06.909> a<00:04:06.970> pretty

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
cool don't you think I've got a pretty

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:12.089 
cool don't you think I've got a pretty
neat<00:04:07.510> looking<00:04:07.810> rack<00:04:08.019> over<00:04:08.349> here<00:04:10.590> Owen<00:04:11.590> just<00:04:11.889> a

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:12.099 
neat looking rack over here Owen just a

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:15.210 
neat looking rack over here Owen just a
little<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:13.299> add<00:04:13.479> on<00:04:13.659> because<00:04:14.620> these<00:04:14.799> tops<00:04:15.099> are

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
little to add on because these tops are

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.129 
little to add on because these tops are
originally<00:04:15.849> used<00:04:16.090> for<00:04:16.239> fish<00:04:16.599> farms<00:04:16.930> and<00:04:17.019> stuff

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
originally used for fish farms and stuff

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.199 
originally used for fish farms and stuff
there's<00:04:17.530> a<00:04:17.620> little<00:04:17.919> hole<00:04:18.099> right<00:04:18.130> here<00:04:18.579> where

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
there's a little hole right here where

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:22.170 
there's a little hole right here where
you<00:04:20.199> know<00:04:20.229> usually<00:04:20.709> they<00:04:20.919> where<00:04:21.880> they<00:04:21.970> put<00:04:22.150> a

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
you know usually they where they put a

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.240 
you know usually they where they put a
pipe<00:04:22.479> through<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:23.229> aerate<00:04:23.409> the<00:04:23.710> fish<00:04:23.889> tanks

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
pipe through to aerate the fish tanks

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.310 
pipe through to aerate the fish tanks
and<00:04:24.370> stuff<00:04:24.460> so<00:04:25.300> what<00:04:25.479> we<00:04:25.599> have<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:25.900> that<00:04:25.930> we<00:04:26.110> put

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
and stuff so what we have is that we put

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.350 
and stuff so what we have is that we put
these<00:04:26.440> little<00:04:26.800> plastic<00:04:27.070> caps<00:04:27.520> to<00:04:27.909> cover<00:04:28.180> up

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
these little plastic caps to cover up

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.439 
these little plastic caps to cover up
the<00:04:28.479> holes<00:04:28.740> so<00:04:29.740> these<00:04:30.340> are<00:04:30.699> gonna<00:04:30.820> be<00:04:31.030> hammered

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
the holes so these are gonna be hammered

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.850 
the holes so these are gonna be hammered
in<00:04:31.919> when<00:04:33.479> when<00:04:34.479> we<00:04:34.659> decide<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.289> put<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.590> snakes

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
in when when we decide to put the snakes

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.469 
in when when we decide to put the snakes
and<00:04:36.099> stuff<00:04:36.310> so<00:04:36.639> that<00:04:36.789> they<00:04:36.909> don't<00:04:37.240> escape

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
and stuff so that they don't escape

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.629 
and stuff so that they don't escape
through<00:04:37.930> this<00:04:38.050> this<00:04:38.860> hole<00:04:39.099> right<00:04:39.130> here

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:39.639
