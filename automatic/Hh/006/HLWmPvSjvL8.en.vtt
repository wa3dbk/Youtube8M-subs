 must work 

00:00:29.309 --> 00:00:42.050
 Soon there will be cartoons more careful micro and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:53.340
 you can either thing I'll see I 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:59.220
 I see what the problem is very simple I 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:02.250
 show see nectar it all starts with 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:08.790
 tv camera dollar door chur i peter and 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:11.070
 pier six o'clock pass stage well 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.439
 viktor camera lens projects 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.860
 the image on the go mirrors which 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:22.380
 break it into three colors red blue 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:26.030
 and green every ray is not the same 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.030
 image but in a different color 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:35.030
 This, too, look in these lamps colored 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:41.270
 the rays are converted to electric 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:49.940
 signals look like we have a company 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:53.200
 why don't you follow me with 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.940
 speed will work how it works 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.800
 epic cues are going underground 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.990
 cable to television transmitter 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.509
 stations which turns signals into 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.130
 radio waves these signals can be 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:07.369
 taken television antenna and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.920
 broadcast tv inside tv 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:12.729
 pierced waves form back into 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.729
 electrical signals 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:22.370
 that's right sometimes radio waves go directly 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.160
 content homes here we are where in 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.070
 do you see everything on our TV 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.870
 like a television camera hold 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.870
 blue red green rays 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:38.950
 cathode ray tube where better 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:38.950
 converted back into a picture 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.130
 also 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:49.870
 where the electrons bombard the screen 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.870
 tv 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:57.250
 watch these two colored heaps closer 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.590
 thousands of red blue-green particles give 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.940
 won simultaneously their joint 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.760
 the work forms a color image 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:17.350
 you're just in time for the cartoon begins 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.350
 we didn't want to see the news 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:32.120
 stop it 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:46.540
 if you are ill so behave no 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:46.540
 TV will not be anyone until the end
