what you know it started off from

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.889

translated over to English and it just

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.520

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
earlier this decade so it just kind of

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.940 
earlier this decade so it just kind of
didn't<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:05.969> as<00:02:06.119> much<00:02:06.350> publicity<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.619> much

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950

fabrics in a layman's book you can call

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.619 
fabrics in a layman's book you can call
this<00:03:55.699> I<00:03:55.879> don't<00:03:56.030> know<00:03:56.090> if<00:03:56.180> I'd<00:03:56.269> say<00:03:56.449> it's<00:03:56.569> a

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:56.629 
this I don't know if I'd say it's a

00:03:56.629 --> 00:04:00.309 
this I don't know if I'd say it's a
layman's<00:03:56.989> book<00:03:57.199> but<00:03:58.209> very<00:03:59.209> unless<00:03:59.959> you<00:04:00.109> go<00:04:00.230> out

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
layman's book but very unless you go out

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.740 
layman's book but very unless you go out
there<00:04:00.500> and<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.799> study<00:04:01.239> textiles<00:04:02.239> you're<00:04:02.599> not

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
there and you study textiles you're not

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.360 
there and you study textiles you're not
going<00:04:02.930> to<00:04:02.989> get<00:04:03.079> better<00:04:03.500> descriptions<00:04:04.160> and<00:04:04.280> I

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:04.370 
going to get better descriptions and I

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:06.159 
going to get better descriptions and I
think<00:04:04.609> the<00:04:04.730> descriptions<00:04:05.239> here<00:04:05.480> are<00:04:05.690> even

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:06.169 
think the descriptions here are even

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:07.330 
think the descriptions here are even
better<00:04:06.319> than<00:04:06.470> some<00:04:06.859> of<00:04:06.919> the<00:04:07.040> ones<00:04:07.069> I've<00:04:07.310> seen

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
better than some of the ones I've seen

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.509 
better than some of the ones I've seen
in<00:04:07.699> textile<00:04:08.120> books<00:04:08.329> so<00:04:09.260> why<00:04:09.919> would<00:04:10.160> you<00:04:10.190> be<00:04:10.489> a

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
in textile books so why would you be a

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:13.300 
in textile books so why would you be a
bit<00:04:10.730> hesitant<00:04:10.940> to<00:04:11.209> buy<00:04:11.389> this<00:04:11.919> it's<00:04:12.919> not<00:04:13.099> the

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:13.310 
bit hesitant to buy this it's not the

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.009 
bit hesitant to buy this it's not the
price<00:04:13.549> if<00:04:13.760> you<00:04:13.910> think<00:04:14.180> paying<00:04:14.419> thirty<00:04:14.840> to

00:04:15.009 --> 00:04:15.019 
price if you think paying thirty to

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:17.409 
price if you think paying thirty to

the<00:04:25.909> issue<00:04:26.180> what<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.450> the<00:04:26.570> issue

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
the issue what is the issue

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.280 
the issue what is the issue
is<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.860> a<00:04:28.010> very<00:04:28.280> Eurocentric<00:04:28.730> view<00:04:29.210> and<00:04:29.630> that

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
is it's a very Eurocentric view and that

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.230 
is it's a very Eurocentric view and that
makes<00:04:30.530> sense<00:04:30.710> written<00:04:31.070> by<00:04:31.190> Italians<00:04:31.670> but<00:04:32.090> if

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
makes sense written by Italians but if

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.230 
makes sense written by Italians but if
you're<00:04:32.420> in<00:04:32.780> let's<00:04:33.350> say<00:04:33.970> Midwest<00:04:34.970> United

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
you're in let's say Midwest United

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:38.380 
you're in let's say Midwest United
States<00:04:35.630> you're<00:04:36.140> down<00:04:36.350> in<00:04:36.560> Brazil<00:04:37.070> you're<00:04:38.000> over

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:38.390 
States you're down in Brazil you're over

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:40.270 
States you're down in Brazil you're over
perhaps<00:04:38.630> in<00:04:38.990> India<00:04:39.410> you<00:04:39.620> may<00:04:39.740> find<00:04:40.010> there's<00:04:40.220> a

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
perhaps in India you may find there's a

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.010 
perhaps in India you may find there's a
bit<00:04:40.430> of<00:04:40.520> a<00:04:40.580> disconnect<00:04:40.970> with<00:04:41.630> what<00:04:41.870> they're

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
bit of a disconnect with what they're

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.810 
bit of a disconnect with what they're
talking<00:04:42.440> about<00:04:42.470> here<00:04:42.830> and<00:04:42.950> what<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.520> what's

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
talking about here and what the what's

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.790 
talking about here and what the what's
available<00:04:44.120> in<00:04:44.480> your<00:04:44.630> country<00:04:44.840> and<00:04:45.230> what<00:04:45.650> you

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
available in your country and what you

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.590 
available in your country and what you
can<00:04:45.950> work<00:04:46.160> with<00:04:46.370> so<00:04:46.520> it's<00:04:46.670> for<00:04:47.090> many<00:04:47.270> people

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
can work with so it's for many people

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.270 
can work with so it's for many people
it's<00:04:47.720> getting<00:04:47.960> behind<00:04:48.170> maybe<00:04:48.260> this<00:04:48.470> up<00:04:48.830> in<00:04:49.160> the

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
it's getting behind maybe this up in the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.490 
it's getting behind maybe this up in the
cloud<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.850> they<00:04:49.970> just<00:04:50.270> can't<00:04:50.540> get<00:04:51.290> to<00:04:51.350> that

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
cloud so they just can't get to that

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.590 
cloud so they just can't get to that
level<00:04:51.650> but<00:04:52.100> I<00:04:52.370> still<00:04:52.910> think<00:04:53.150> there<00:04:53.270> are<00:04:53.360> so

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:53.600 
level but I still think there are so

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.270 
level but I still think there are so
many<00:04:53.690> great<00:04:53.900> lessons<00:04:54.110> you<00:04:54.410> can<00:04:54.560> apply<00:04:54.770> the

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
many great lessons you can apply the

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.540 
many great lessons you can apply the
other<00:04:55.400> one's<00:04:55.580> going<00:04:55.850> to<00:04:55.880> be<00:04:56.090> it's<00:04:56.660> a<00:04:56.810> bit<00:04:57.650> dated

00:04:58.540 --> 00:04:58.550 
other one's going to be it's a bit dated

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.090 
other one's going to be it's a bit dated
like<00:04:59.090> there<00:04:59.330> isn't<00:04:59.510> a<00:04:59.900> lot<00:05:00.410> of<00:05:00.530> the<00:05:00.620> pictures<00:05:00.770> a

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
like there isn't a lot of the pictures a

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.950 
like there isn't a lot of the pictures a
lot<00:05:01.280> of<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.520> images<00:05:01.940> they<00:05:02.150> use<00:05:02.360> most<00:05:02.660> of<00:05:02.810> them

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
lot of the images they use most of them

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.020 
lot of the images they use most of them
they're<00:05:03.350> just<00:05:03.380> older<00:05:03.980> and<00:05:04.430> I<00:05:04.520> don't<00:05:04.550> know<00:05:04.910> if

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
they're just older and I don't know if
