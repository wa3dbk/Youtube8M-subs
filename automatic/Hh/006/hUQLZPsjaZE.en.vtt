00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.300
 what's up magmatics in this video we're going 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.110
 to make a performance comparison 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:18.070
 between the galaxy knowledge and the lenovo k 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.070
 920 let's see it 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.440
 as always when I make comparisons of 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:43.660
 performance let's start looking at the 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:45.579
 navigation while we look at the 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.489
 tests you can see the difference 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.680
 between screens and in turn sound 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:52.030
 when we play some game I have 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.850
 to say that good in terms of 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.799
 reproduction of targets in the ips of it 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.659
 again reproduces better colors 

00:00:56.799 --> 00:01:00.460
 yes, as for blacks, you know that 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:03.789
 the amoled are unrivaled and in this 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:06.039
 case is the lecce who takes the cat 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.750
 to the water 'may be the screens 

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:10.330
 front although good the truth that in the 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.550
 video does not do much justice the screen 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.920
 of milk you know that the screens 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.350
 amoled have a rosy hue in the 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.320
 videos and in reality it's not like that 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.850
 well let's see what's gone I'm going 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.930
 to the browser chrome mode desk and 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.930
 we are going to attack 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.340
 there we see that he has loaded none of the 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.340
 two 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.340
 it seems that it has loaded a little before 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:45.340
 the lenovo 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 to see how the two perfect move 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.890
 let's go to another link 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.090
 the lenovo has loaded 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.630
 on the right music 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.630
 and it seems that already finished 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.410
 is that the gesture of pinching the scroll and 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.410
 Everything else is perfect 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.660
 let's go to another link 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.900
 has loaded the lenovo 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.590
 in the success of the follow and it seems that she 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.210
 we follow 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.010
 lenovo 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.260
 and the load you see that the difference is 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:09.970
 a lot 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.319
 let's see if we have any means by 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.950
 here and here we have a video we are going to 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.950
 reproduce it 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.750
 charge a little before lenovo later 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.340
 we already have open the application of 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.340
 youtube so we play some videos 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.010
 same 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.480
 lenovo 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.350
 he does not 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.070
 still again 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.520
 one out and well let's go to the last 

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.000
 practically the same is a little before 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.000
 the nou but we are different 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
 priceless 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.450
 we started with the asphalt 8 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.160
 I did not say the volume but it was 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.160
 stop on both devices 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:29.740
 open leds a tad before good I'll 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:29.740
 lower the volume of the menu 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.540
 Seeing how milk is 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.689
 and some more 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:48.449
 volume more rather higher in the 

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:48.449
 angry voice 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:09.050
 if we raise it a little bit but still the 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.950
 volume of the new one is still more 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.900
 high 

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:14.260
 let's open the cni for speed most 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.260
 SE busca 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:44.120
 and it seems that it has come down a little bit before 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.860
 by car 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.860
 let's see when the career 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:54.319
 in fact a tad before 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:54.319
 good the movement 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:03.120
 You can see how the Hellene ball sounds 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:07.550
 grace is spectacular 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:07.550
 he lowered the volume and I raise the one of the no 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.750
 finally we go to modern combat 4 

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:45.229
 charge a little bit before the right low and 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.530
 well let's start a game very 

00:06:45.229 --> 00:06:47.530
 fast 

00:06:55.480 --> 00:07:00.450
 prepared and now in lenovo
