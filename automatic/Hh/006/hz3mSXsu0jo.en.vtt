to take our alcohol wipe and we're going
to<00:00:53.039> clean<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.670> rubber<00:00:54.180> stopper<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
to clean the rubber stopper of the

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.770 
to clean the rubber stopper of the
multi-use<00:00:55.289> file<00:00:55.590> you<00:00:56.309> want<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.550> clean<00:00:57.360> firm

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
multi-use file you want to clean firm

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.279 
multi-use file you want to clean firm
and<00:00:58.109> briskly<00:00:59.239> want<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> allow<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.570> vial<00:01:01.020> to

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
dry before you inject the needle so you

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.780 
dry before you inject the needle so you
don't<00:01:03.600> have<00:01:03.719> alcohol<00:01:03.870> on<00:01:04.260> your<00:01:04.409> needle<00:01:04.790> once

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
to inject air into the vial before you

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
to inject air into the vial before you
can<00:01:16.560> draw<00:01:16.979> up<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.310> medication<00:01:17.880> so<00:01:18.689> since

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
can draw up the medication so since

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.600 
can draw up the medication so since
we're<00:01:19.110> giving<00:01:19.350> four<00:01:19.590> units<00:01:19.890> of<00:01:19.979> insulin<00:01:20.159> for

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
we're giving four units of insulin for

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.550 
we're giving four units of insulin for
this<00:01:20.790> demonstration<00:01:21.000> we'll<00:01:21.840> need<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.110> draw<00:01:22.320> up

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
this demonstration we'll need to draw up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.039 
this demonstration we'll need to draw up
4<00:01:22.860> units<00:01:22.890> of<00:01:23.280> air<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:24.270> I'm<00:01:24.330> going<00:01:24.570> to<00:01:24.630> put<00:01:24.840> four

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
4 units of air so I'm going to put four

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.789 
4 units of air so I'm going to put four
units<00:01:25.350> of<00:01:25.439> error<00:01:25.650> in<00:01:25.860> my<00:01:26.009> syringe<00:01:27.560> place<00:01:28.560> the

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
units of error in my syringe place the

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.300 
units of error in my syringe place the
needle<00:01:28.950> into<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.400> rubber<00:01:29.729> stopper<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
needle into the rubber stopper and

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.760 
needle into the rubber stopper and
inject<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.460> air<00:01:33.049> now<00:01:34.049> I'm<00:01:34.170> going<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> invert

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
inject the air now I'm going to invert

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.760 
inject the air now I'm going to invert
the<00:01:34.950> bottle<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:36.079> pull<00:01:37.079> down<00:01:37.259> hard<00:01:37.560> on<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
the bottle and pull down hard on the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.679 
the bottle and pull down hard on the
plunger<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.790> insulin<00:01:39.270> to<00:01:39.390> fill<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
plunger to get the insulin to fill the

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.780 
plunger to get the insulin to fill the
syringe<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.890> you're<00:01:41.040> going<00:01:41.159> to<00:01:41.220> pull<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.579> down

syringe so you're going to pull it down

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.010 
syringe so you're going to pull it down
and<00:01:43.070> let<00:01:44.070> it<00:01:44.189> fill<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.030> then<00:01:45.600> you<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:45.930> to
