is<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.359> board<00:00:27.990> strategy<00:00:28.650> direction<00:00:29.250> or<00:00:29.400> Tim

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
is a board strategy direction or Tim

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.690 
is a board strategy direction or Tim
Cook<00:00:30.420> strategy<00:00:31.199> direction<00:00:32.009> where<00:00:32.520> is<00:00:32.669> a

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
Cook strategy direction where is a

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.639 
Cook strategy direction where is a
strategic<00:00:33.360> vision<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.930> you<00:00:34.079> perceive<00:00:34.500> at

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
strategic vision that you perceive at

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:36.650 
strategic vision that you perceive at
Apple<00:00:34.980> I<00:00:35.219> think<00:00:35.700> that's<00:00:36.030> what's<00:00:36.210> missing<00:00:36.360> I

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
Apple I think that's what's missing I

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.119 
Apple I think that's what's missing I
think<00:00:36.690> there's<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.320> there's<00:00:37.590> strategic

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
think there's right there's strategic

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:39.740 
think there's right there's strategic
direction<00:00:38.280> there<00:00:38.700> might<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:38.940> be<00:00:39.000> vision<00:00:39.510> and

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
direction there might not be vision and

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.510 
direction there might not be vision and
I<00:00:40.170> think<00:00:40.200> people<00:00:40.649> are<00:00:40.739> looking<00:00:41.160> for<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
I think people are looking for the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.490 
I think people are looking for the
vision<00:00:41.879> of<00:00:41.969> what<00:00:42.149> Apple<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.660> gonna<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:43.079> as<00:00:43.260> both

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
vision of what Apple is gonna be as both

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.049 
vision of what Apple is gonna be as both
a<00:00:43.590> hardware<00:00:43.860> right<00:00:44.460> more<00:00:44.670> importantly

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
a hardware right more importantly

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.549 
a hardware right more importantly
software<00:00:45.510> company<00:00:45.870> I<00:00:45.960> guess<00:00:46.140> so<00:00:46.289> Scott

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
software company I guess so Scott

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.229 
software company I guess so Scott

branding<00:00:48.780> but<00:00:48.870> Brandi's<00:00:49.350> vision<00:00:49.710> as<00:00:49.829> well

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.670 
branding but Brandi's vision as well
isn't<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.460> sure<00:00:51.270> it's<00:00:51.629> it's<00:00:51.960> it's<00:00:52.289> setting<00:00:52.620> a

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
isn't it sure it's it's it's setting a

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.709 
isn't it sure it's it's it's setting a
vision<00:00:52.949> but<00:00:53.090> earlier<00:00:54.090> before<00:00:54.210> you'd<00:00:54.420> ask<00:00:54.570> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
vision but earlier before you'd ask the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.240 
vision but earlier before you'd ask the
question<00:00:55.079> what<00:00:55.199> Tim<00:00:55.410> Cook<00:00:55.620> needs<00:00:55.829> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.129> to

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
question what Tim Cook needs to do to

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.810 
question what Tim Cook needs to do to
keep<00:00:56.370> his<00:00:56.550> job

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
keep his job

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.819 
keep his job
I<00:00:57.059> think<00:00:57.539> Tim<00:00:57.660> Cook<00:00:57.870> has<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.199> safest<00:00:58.469> job<00:00:58.559> in

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
I think Tim Cook has the safest job in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.619 
I think Tim Cook has the safest job in
America<00:00:59.190> right<00:00:59.340> now<00:00:59.370> if<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.329> look<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.570> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
America right now if you look at the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.119 
America right now if you look at the
people<00:01:00.780> on<00:01:00.960> his<00:01:01.109> board<00:01:01.440> whether<00:01:01.710> it's<00:01:01.890> Mickey

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
people on his board whether it's Mickey

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.770 
people on his board whether it's Mickey
Drexler<00:01:02.280> I<00:01:02.609> don't<00:01:02.820> know<00:01:02.910> if<00:01:02.969> Al<00:01:03.120> Gore<00:01:03.149> still<00:01:03.600> on

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
Drexler I don't know if Al Gore still on

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.719 
Drexler I don't know if Al Gore still on
his<00:01:03.899> board<00:01:04.110> these<00:01:04.710> guys<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.159> scare<00:01:05.339> easily

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
his board these guys don't scare easily

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.609 
his board these guys don't scare easily
and<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.330> reason<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:06.750> became<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.260> largest

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
and the reason this became the largest

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.140 
and the reason this became the largest
market<00:01:08.010> cap<00:01:08.189> company<00:01:08.610> in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> world<00:01:08.970> was

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
because they were the premium product

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.100 
because they were the premium product
