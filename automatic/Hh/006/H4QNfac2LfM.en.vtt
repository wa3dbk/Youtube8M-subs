fine but if I could really close-up with
the<00:00:43.070> 20<00:00:43.370> millimeter<00:00:43.520> waves<00:00:43.910> you<00:00:44.359> get

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
the 20 millimeter waves you get

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.569 
the 20 millimeter waves you get
distortion<00:00:45.800> it<00:00:45.890> doesn't<00:00:46.129> look<00:00:46.219> that<00:00:46.250> good

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:46.579 
distortion it doesn't look that good

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.569 
distortion it doesn't look that good
sure<00:00:49.780> so<00:00:50.780> what<00:00:51.320> we<00:00:51.379> want<00:00:51.590> is<00:00:51.769> more<00:00:52.039> of<00:00:52.100> a<00:00:52.399> kind

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
sure so what we want is more of a kind

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:55.119 
sure so what we want is more of a kind
of<00:00:52.609> bit<00:00:53.090> more<00:00:53.300> of<00:00:53.449> teleporter<00:00:54.019> not<00:00:54.230> just<00:00:54.530> a<00:00:54.620> 20

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
of bit more of teleporter not just a 20

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:57.189 
of bit more of teleporter not just a 20
millimeter<00:00:55.519> lens<00:00:55.820> however<00:00:56.449> this<00:00:56.600> is<00:00:56.750> not<00:00:56.840> a<00:00:56.899> d

00:00:57.189 --> 00:00:57.199 
millimeter lens however this is not a d

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.020 
millimeter lens however this is not a d
300<00:00:57.559> is<00:00:58.070> actually<00:00:58.339> makes<00:00:58.460> it<00:00:58.579> round<00:00:58.760> about<00:00:58.879> a

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
300 is actually makes it round about a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.900 
300 is actually makes it round about a
13<00:00:59.570> millimeter<00:00:59.690> lens<00:01:00.399> one<00:01:01.399> thing<00:01:01.550> which<00:01:01.670> aku's

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
13 millimeter lens one thing which aku's

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.660 
13 millimeter lens one thing which aku's
use<00:01:02.149> is<00:01:02.329> a<00:01:02.600> 50<00:01:03.140> mil<00:01:03.289> lens<00:01:03.469> now<00:01:03.769> 50<00:01:04.129> mil<00:01:04.280> game<00:01:04.520> is

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
use is a 50 mil lens now 50 mil game is

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.520 
use is a 50 mil lens now 50 mil game is
still<00:01:04.820> quite<00:01:05.090> white<00:01:05.420> when<00:01:05.990> you're<00:01:06.140> using<00:01:06.350> it

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
still quite white when you're using it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.610

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:12.200 
300 or a crop frame sensor camera then

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.140 
300 or a crop frame sensor camera then
it's<00:01:12.350> usually<00:01:12.530> on<00:01:12.830> C<00:01:13.070> is<00:01:13.250> all<00:01:13.580> key<00:01:13.790> it's<00:01:13.970> very

mil<00:01:17.720> also<00:01:18.050> have<00:01:18.260> very<00:01:18.620> little<00:01:19.100> distortion<00:01:19.370> and

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:19.730 
mil also have very little distortion and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.160 
mil also have very little distortion and
it's<00:01:19.940> good<00:01:20.120> for<00:01:20.330> taking<00:01:20.690> photos<00:01:20.960> of<00:01:21.110> children

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
it's good for taking photos of children

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.810 
it's good for taking photos of children
like<00:01:22.100> this<00:01:23.080> so<00:01:24.080> from<00:01:24.920> far<00:01:25.130> away<00:01:25.220> we're<00:01:25.700> now

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
like this so from far away we're now

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.630 
like this so from far away we're now
getting<00:01:25.970> much<00:01:26.210> closer<00:01:26.480> and<00:01:27.340> we<00:01:28.340> can<00:01:28.490> get

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
getting much closer and we can get

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.570 
getting much closer and we can get
really<00:01:29.060> close<00:01:29.540> to<00:01:29.960> the<00:01:30.050> 50<00:01:30.350> mil<00:01:31.060> there<00:01:32.710> and<00:01:33.710> you

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:34.580 
really close to the 50 mil there and you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.400 
really close to the 50 mil there and you
also<00:01:34.730> get<00:01:34.910> a<00:01:34.940> really<00:01:35.030> lovely<00:01:35.690> shallow<00:01:36.080> depth

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
also get a really lovely shallow depth

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.230 
also get a really lovely shallow depth
of<00:01:36.500> field<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.010> this<00:01:37.310> is<00:01:37.400> a<00:01:37.430> 50<00:01:37.730> mil<00:01:37.850> at<00:01:38.030> one

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
of field so this is a 50 mil at one

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.760 
of field so this is a 50 mil at one
point<00:01:38.420> for<00:01:38.780> which<00:01:39.080> really<00:01:39.350> means<00:01:39.500> you've<00:01:39.650> got

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
point for which really means you've got

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.200 
point for which really means you've got
like<00:01:39.920> I'm<00:01:40.040> telling<00:01:40.370> you<00:01:40.550> bits<00:01:40.730> of<00:01:40.850> depth<00:01:41.030> field

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
like I'm telling you bits of depth field

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.090 
like I'm telling you bits of depth field
but<00:01:41.720> it<00:01:41.810> also<00:01:42.020> means<00:01:42.230> you<00:01:42.350> can<00:01:42.470> use<00:01:42.650> available

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.100 
but it also means you can use available

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.770 
but it also means you can use available
like<00:01:43.640> natural<00:01:44.210> way<00:01:44.330> so<00:01:44.360> you<00:01:44.510> don't<00:01:44.630> have<00:01:44.690> to

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:44.780 
like natural way so you don't have to

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.510 
like natural way so you don't have to
bring<00:01:44.900> flash<00:01:45.290> in<00:01:45.530> whenever<00:01:45.980> you're<00:01:46.220> shooting

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
bring flash in whenever you're shooting

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.430 
bring flash in whenever you're shooting
young<00:01:46.700> children<00:01:47.090> where<00:01:47.480> it<00:01:47.600> flash<00:01:47.990> you<00:01:48.260> might

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
young children where it flash you might

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.340 
young children where it flash you might
not<00:01:48.620> make<00:01:48.680> them<00:01:49.040> very<00:01:49.190> happy<00:01:49.810> so<00:01:50.810> the<00:01:51.080> first

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
not make them very happy so the first

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.310 
not make them very happy so the first
class<00:01:51.650> acclaims<00:01:52.400> really<00:01:52.820> is<00:01:53.090> the<00:01:53.570> 85

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:54.320 
class acclaims really is the 85

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.770 
class acclaims really is the 85
millimeter<00:01:54.890> at<00:01:55.250> one<00:01:55.670> point<00:01:55.850> for<00:01:56.120> this<00:01:56.390> is<00:01:56.660> the

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
millimeter at one point for this is the

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.630 
millimeter at one point for this is the
one<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.200> really<00:01:57.350> considered<00:01:57.740> to<00:01:57.920> be<00:01:58.040> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
one that is really considered to be the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.630 
one that is really considered to be the
portrait<00:01:59.390> lens<00:01:59.660> this<00:02:00.260> is<00:02:00.440> an<00:02:00.530> F<00:02:00.650> 1.4<00:02:01.460> which

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
portrait lens this is an F 1.4 which

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.220 
portrait lens this is an F 1.4 which
again<00:02:01.880> means<00:02:02.030> a<00:02:02.150> very<00:02:02.390> sheltered<00:02:02.630> field

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.230 
again means a very sheltered field

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.710 
again means a very sheltered field
however<00:02:04.040> the<00:02:04.460> closest<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.150> can<00:02:05.210> get<00:02:05.450> is

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
however the closest I can get is

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.630 
however the closest I can get is
actually<00:02:05.840> only<00:02:06.200> about<00:02:06.290> one<00:02:06.710> meter<00:02:07.070> away<00:02:07.250> so

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.640 
actually only about one meter away so

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.360 
actually only about one meter away so
being<00:02:07.880> here<00:02:08.299> is<00:02:08.450> just<00:02:08.840> going<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:09.349> give<00:02:09.469> me

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
being here is just going to give me

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.660 
being here is just going to give me
a<00:02:14.690> blurry<00:02:15.690> photo<00:02:15.780> sites<00:02:16.409> need<00:02:16.590> to<00:02:16.680> be<00:02:16.769> but<00:02:16.950> back

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
a blurry photo sites need to be but back

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.630 
a blurry photo sites need to be but back
here<00:02:20.420> sure<00:02:21.420> sit<00:02:21.930> there<00:02:22.140> okay<00:02:22.980> so<00:02:23.400> that<00:02:23.610> gives

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
here sure sit there okay so that gives

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.460 
here sure sit there okay so that gives
you<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:23.940> lovely<00:02:24.180> shallow<00:02:24.659> depth-of-field<00:02:25.110> you

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
you a lovely shallow depth-of-field you

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.990 
you a lovely shallow depth-of-field you
can't<00:02:25.680> see<00:02:25.799> anything<00:02:26.430> in<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> back<00:02:26.819> that's

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
can't see anything in the back that's

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.830 
can't see anything in the back that's
all<00:02:27.090> nice<00:02:27.360> lovely<00:02:27.870> milky<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.829> blurry<00:02:29.250> now

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
all nice lovely milky and blurry now

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.479 
all nice lovely milky and blurry now
going<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:31.019> from<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.319> 85<00:02:31.739> millimeter<00:02:32.129> lens<00:02:32.340> and

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
going up from the 85 millimeter lens and

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.660 
going up from the 85 millimeter lens and
you've<00:02:32.579> got<00:02:32.700> 105<00:02:33.480> millimeter<00:02:33.780> lens<00:02:34.489> we<00:02:35.489> can

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
you've got 105 millimeter lens we can

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.940 
you've got 105 millimeter lens we can
get<00:02:35.849> with<00:02:36.030> these<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.510> macro<00:02:37.140> lens<00:02:37.319> now<00:02:37.650> the

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
get with these is a macro lens now the

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.770 
get with these is a macro lens now the
max<00:02:38.190> really<00:02:38.340> great<00:02:38.819> thing<00:02:39.030> is<00:02:39.150> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.599> get

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
max really great thing is you can get

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.050 
max really great thing is you can get
and<00:02:40.200> for<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.560> close<00:02:40.890> to<00:02:41.370> your<00:02:41.489> subject

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
and for a close to your subject

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.900 
and for a close to your subject
so<00:02:42.420> again<00:02:42.599> baby<00:02:43.200> this<00:02:43.590> is<00:02:43.739> great<00:02:44.099> you<00:02:44.549> can<00:02:44.579> get

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
so again baby this is great you can get

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.190 
so again baby this is great you can get
really<00:02:45.150> close<00:02:45.329> up<00:02:45.569> and<00:02:45.690> look<00:02:45.840> at<00:02:45.959> stuff<00:02:46.140> like

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
really close up and look at stuff like

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.979 
really close up and look at stuff like
just<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.950> eyelashes<00:02:47.760> on<00:02:47.970> their<00:02:48.120> face<00:02:48.329> again

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
just the eyelashes on their face again

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.380 
just the eyelashes on their face again
even<00:02:49.290> at<00:02:49.379> AF<00:02:49.560> 2.8<00:02:50.099> this<00:02:50.489> depth<00:02:50.879> of<00:02:50.970> field<00:02:51.239> is

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
even at AF 2.8 this depth of field is

00:02:51.390 --> 00:03:18.710 
even at AF 2.8 this depth of field is
tiny<00:02:52.019> so<00:03:02.269> in<00:03:03.269> fact<00:03:03.569> need<00:03:03.810> to<00:03:03.840> get<00:03:04.049> you<00:03:17.359> okay<00:03:18.359> so

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
tiny so in fact need to get you okay so

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.020 
tiny so in fact need to get you okay so
but<00:03:19.019> the<00:03:19.109> one<00:03:19.290> thing<00:03:19.470> about<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.889> at<00:03:20.220> the<00:03:20.519> 105

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
but the one thing about this at the 105

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.089 
but the one thing about this at the 105
millimeter<00:03:21.329> lens<00:03:21.630> is<00:03:21.810> quite<00:03:22.019> a<00:03:22.169> slow<00:03:22.590> one<00:03:22.889> to

00:03:23.089 --> 00:03:23.099 
millimeter lens is quite a slow one to

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:30.319 
millimeter lens is quite a slow one to
focus<00:03:23.569> as<00:03:24.569> you'll<00:03:24.780> see<00:03:28.400> see<00:03:29.400> it's<00:03:29.700> quite<00:03:29.940> slow

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
focus as you'll see see it's quite slow

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.479 
focus as you'll see see it's quite slow
to<00:03:30.389> actually<00:03:30.780> find<00:03:31.019> focus<00:03:31.440> and<00:03:31.650> then<00:03:32.280> two

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
to actually find focus and then two

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:33.860 
to actually find focus and then two
point<00:03:32.700> eight<00:03:32.819> years<00:03:33.030> of<00:03:33.150> signals<00:03:33.510> break<00:03:33.720> as

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
point eight years of signals break as

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.420 
point eight years of signals break as
they're<00:03:34.290> 85<00:03:34.799> 150<00:03:35.579> mil<00:03:35.760> lens<00:03:36.200> so<00:03:37.200> next<00:03:37.620> thing<00:03:37.769> up

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
they're 85 150 mil lens so next thing up

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.960 
they're 85 150 mil lens so next thing up
really<00:03:39.120> is<00:03:39.329> the<00:03:39.690> big<00:03:40.049> boy<00:03:40.349> orb<00:03:40.859> lenses<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.639> is

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
really is the big boy orb lenses this is

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:46.009 
really is the big boy orb lenses this is
a<00:03:42.000> 70<00:03:42.660> to<00:03:43.139> 200<00:03:43.470> millimeter<00:03:44.400> lens<00:03:44.730> from<00:03:45.629> Nichols

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
a 70 to 200 millimeter lens from Nichols

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.680 
a 70 to 200 millimeter lens from Nichols
and<00:03:46.199> it's<00:03:46.349> a<00:03:46.440> VR<00:03:46.799> net<00:03:47.040> however<00:03:47.690> whenever

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
and it's a VR net however whenever

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.449 
and it's a VR net however whenever
you're<00:03:49.049> at<00:03:49.260> whatever<00:03:49.530> focal<00:03:50.099> length<00:03:50.280> around

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
you're at whatever focal length around

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:51.800 
you're at whatever focal length around
you<00:03:50.699> really<00:03:51.030> need<00:03:51.180> to<00:03:51.239> have<00:03:51.329> a<00:03:51.419> shutter<00:03:51.660> speed

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
you really need to have a shutter speed

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.439 
you really need to have a shutter speed
which<00:03:52.199> is<00:03:52.410> as<00:03:52.650> fast<00:03:52.980> as<00:03:53.129> the<00:03:53.819> length<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.359> the

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:54.449 
which is as fast as the length of the

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:55.670 
which is as fast as the length of the
focal<00:03:54.750> length<00:03:54.780> so<00:03:54.989> if<00:03:55.049> you're<00:03:55.169> at<00:03:55.260> 200

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
focal length so if you're at 200

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.990 
focal length so if you're at 200
millimetres<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.160> need<00:03:56.310> to<00:03:56.430> really<00:03:56.639> have<00:03:56.669> a

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
millimetres you need to really have a

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.900 
millimetres you need to really have a
200th<00:03:57.989> of<00:03:58.109> a<00:03:58.349> second<00:03:58.829> exposure<00:03:59.250> if<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.819> have

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
200th of a second exposure if you have

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:02.780 
200th of a second exposure if you have
70<00:04:00.239> really<00:04:00.720> need<00:04:00.870> to<00:04:00.989> have<00:04:01.109> to<00:04:01.739> the<00:04:01.859> 90th<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.639> a

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790 
70 really need to have to the 90th of a

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.289 
70 really need to have to the 90th of a
second

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
second

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:06.170 
second
however<00:04:03.750> again<00:04:04.079> with<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.470> 70<00:04:05.459> to<00:04:05.519> 200<00:04:05.699> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
however again with the 70 to 200 the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.659 
however again with the 70 to 200 the
closest<00:04:06.780> focusing<00:04:06.959> distance<00:04:07.560> is<00:04:07.709> one<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.579> a

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
closest focusing distance is one and a

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:10.970 
closest focusing distance is one and a
half<00:04:08.699> liters<00:04:09.359> a<00:04:09.389> week<00:04:09.629> so<00:04:09.810> I<00:04:09.840> have<00:04:10.139> speed<00:04:10.349> a<00:04:10.530> way

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
half liters a week so I have speed a way

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.309 
half liters a week so I have speed a way
back<00:04:11.220> here<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:11.879> used<00:04:12.180> for<00:04:12.209> some<00:04:12.510> candid

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:13.319 
back here so that's used for some candid

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.830 
back here so that's used for some candid
shot<00:04:13.819> but<00:04:14.819> if<00:04:14.940> you're<00:04:15.060> doing<00:04:15.180> close-up<00:04:15.629> being

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
shot but if you're doing close-up being

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.930 
shot but if you're doing close-up being
shot<00:04:16.019> this<00:04:16.470> is<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:16.979> too<00:04:17.099> big<00:04:17.340> it<00:04:17.430> also<00:04:17.609> leaks

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
shot this is just too big it also leaks

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.050 
shot this is just too big it also leaks
scary<00:04:18.389> as<00:04:18.539> hell<00:04:18.780> too

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
scary as hell too

scary as hell too
ah<00:04:22.200> very<00:04:23.790> scary<00:04:24.790> children<00:04:25.360> however<00:04:26.020> if<00:04:26.350> you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
ah very scary children however if you

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.500 
ah very scary children however if you
have<00:04:26.680> at<00:04:26.889> 200<00:04:27.400> millimeters<00:04:27.790> and<00:04:28.030> you<00:04:28.330> have<00:04:28.480> a

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
have at 200 millimeters and you have a

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.290 
have at 200 millimeters and you have a
FG<00:04:28.960> point<00:04:29.169> each<00:04:29.320> you<00:04:29.560> get<00:04:29.770> beautiful<00:04:30.639> shallow

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
FG point each you get beautiful shallow

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.680 
FG point each you get beautiful shallow
depth<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.810> field

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:46.830 

yes<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.820> it's<00:04:45.940> nice<00:04:46.120> having<00:04:46.419> that<00:04:46.540> little<00:04:46.720> bit

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
yes so it's nice having that little bit

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.300 
yes so it's nice having that little bit
of<00:04:46.960> zoom<00:04:47.290> that<00:04:47.440> you've<00:04:47.560> got<00:04:47.770> but<00:04:47.919> you<00:04:48.010> do<00:04:48.160> have

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
of zoom that you've got but you do have

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.530 
of zoom that you've got but you do have
to<00:04:48.430> be<00:04:48.520> a<00:04:48.550> little<00:04:48.820> bit<00:04:48.910> further<00:04:49.150> wait<00:04:49.360> however

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:49.540 
to be a little bit further wait however

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.090 
to be a little bit further wait however
that's<00:04:49.810> this<00:04:49.960> quick<00:04:50.200> dude<00:04:50.380> that<00:04:50.560> wasn't<00:04:50.800> too

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
that's this quick dude that wasn't too

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.250 
that's this quick dude that wasn't too
far<00:04:51.370> away<00:04:51.400> at<00:04:51.970> all<00:04:52.180> feet<00:04:52.419> over<00:04:52.630> there<00:04:52.780> Keith

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
far away at all feet over there Keith

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.200 
far away at all feet over there Keith
well<00:04:53.620> children<00:04:53.860> are<00:04:54.070> splattering<00:04:54.700> food<00:04:54.940> all

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
well children are splattering food all

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.719 
well children are splattering food all
over<00:04:55.570> themselves<00:04:55.830> so<00:04:56.830> that's<00:04:57.280> pretty<00:04:57.639> much

00:04:57.719 --> 00:04:57.729 
over themselves so that's pretty much

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:00.060 
over themselves so that's pretty much
what<00:04:58.000> I<00:04:58.060> would<00:04:58.270> see<00:04:58.450> are<00:04:58.660> they<00:04:59.110> kind<00:04:59.229> of<00:04:59.320> the

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:00.070 
what I would see are they kind of the

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.830 
what I would see are they kind of the
lenses<00:05:01.030> if<00:05:01.210> you're<00:05:01.419> doing<00:05:01.630> portraits

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
lenses if you're doing portraits

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:04.950 
lenses if you're doing portraits
obviously<00:05:02.410> there's<00:05:02.919> the<00:05:03.150> 28<00:05:04.150> to<00:05:04.450> 70

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
obviously there's the 28 to 70

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.780 
obviously there's the 28 to 70
millimeter<00:05:05.410> lens<00:05:05.650> and<00:05:05.919> we<00:05:06.220> can<00:05:06.370> get<00:05:06.490> from<00:05:06.639> Nick

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:06.790 
millimeter lens and we can get from Nick

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:13.650 
millimeter lens and we can get from Nick
on<00:05:06.940> tamarind<00:05:07.389> Sigma<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:11.770> one<00:05:12.010> and<00:05:12.540> that<00:05:13.540> was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:13.660 
on tamarind Sigma this one and that was

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.240 
on tamarind Sigma this one and that was
good<00:05:14.020> zoom<00:05:14.410> reads<00:05:14.650> but<00:05:14.800> you<00:05:14.889> obviously<00:05:14.979> don't

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
good zoom reads but you obviously don't

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.100 
good zoom reads but you obviously don't
really<00:05:15.490> what<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.669> do<00:05:15.790> to<00:05:15.970> mature<00:05:16.300> to<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.570> 28

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:17.110 
really what to do to mature to the 28

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.409 
really what to do to mature to the 28
millimeter<00:05:17.620> one<00:05:18.010> of<00:05:18.100> whom<00:05:18.190> were<00:05:18.310> over<00:05:18.639> 70<00:05:19.240> it's

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
millimeter one of whom were over 70 it's

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.680 
millimeter one of whom were over 70 it's
also<00:05:19.570> a<00:05:19.690> very<00:05:19.960> long<00:05:20.320> we<00:05:20.440> can<00:05:20.620> get<00:05:20.740> very<00:05:20.889> close

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
also a very long we can get very close

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.140 
also a very long we can get very close
however<00:05:22.690> all<00:05:23.350> of<00:05:23.410> these<00:05:23.860> are<00:05:24.400> not<00:05:24.789> like<00:05:25.000> you'd

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:25.150 
however all of these are not like you'd

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.920 
however all of these are not like you'd
compare<00:05:25.750> to<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.800> best<00:05:27.070> portrait<00:05:27.940> lens<00:05:28.150> I've

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
compare to the best portrait lens I've

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:33.270 
compare to the best portrait lens I've
found<00:05:29.320> so<00:05:30.070> it's<00:05:30.220> not<00:05:30.340> 50<00:05:30.729> mil<00:05:31.650> which<00:05:32.650> is<00:05:32.800> okay

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:33.280 
found so it's not 50 mil which is okay

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:41.550 
found so it's not 50 mil which is okay
it's<00:05:33.940> not<00:05:39.419> it's<00:05:40.419> not<00:05:40.450> the<00:05:40.630> equivalent<00:05:40.690> event

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
it's not it's not the equivalent event

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.420 
it's not it's not the equivalent event
which<00:05:41.740> is<00:05:41.890> an<00:05:42.010> amazing<00:05:42.340> list<00:05:42.760> at<00:05:42.970> 1.4<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:44.430> it's

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:45.430 
which is an amazing list at 1.4 and it's

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:47.909 
which is an amazing list at 1.4 and it's
not<00:05:45.640> even<00:05:45.970> the<00:05:46.720> hundred<00:05:47.200> and<00:05:47.350> five<00:05:47.470> millimeter

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
not even the hundred and five millimeter

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:51.360 
not even the hundred and five millimeter
lens<00:05:48.360> the<00:05:49.360> absolute<00:05:50.139> best<00:05:50.470> portrait<00:05:51.160> lens

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:51.370 
lens the absolute best portrait lens

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:55.580 
lens the absolute best portrait lens
that<00:05:51.490> you<00:05:51.550> can<00:05:51.789> get<00:05:52.060> is<00:05:52.419> this<00:05:53.110> one<00:05:53.440> down<00:05:53.950> here

Wow so the Canon 600 millimeter f4 lens

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.870 
Wow so the Canon 600 millimeter f4 lens
I<00:06:01.630> found<00:06:01.870> is<00:06:01.990> the<00:06:02.229> absolute<00:06:02.800> best<00:06:03.310> portrait

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:03.880 
I found is the absolute best portrait

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.760 
I found is the absolute best portrait
lens<00:06:04.060> you<00:06:04.150> can<00:06:04.270> get<00:06:04.450> especially<00:06:04.900> if<00:06:05.560> you're

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770

lens you can get especially if you're
shooting<00:06:05.950> babies<00:06:06.430> isn't<00:06:07.120> that<00:06:07.180> right

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
shooting babies isn't that right

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:11.520 
shooting babies isn't that right
Christina<00:06:09.660> she's<00:06:10.660> not<00:06:10.870> impressed

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:11.530 
Christina she's not impressed

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:14.730 
Christina she's not impressed
however<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.280> am<00:06:12.550> so<00:06:13.000> I'm<00:06:13.240> getting<00:06:13.360> shot<00:06:13.780> over

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:14.740 
however I am so I'm getting shot over

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:22.980 
however I am so I'm getting shot over
here<00:06:19.800> but<00:06:20.800> though<00:06:21.340> but<00:06:22.330> you<00:06:22.360> can<00:06:22.570> also<00:06:22.750> get

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:22.990 
here but though but you can also get

00:06:22.990 --> 00:06:24.900 
here but though but you can also get
very<00:06:23.410> close<00:06:23.770> especially<00:06:24.100> if<00:06:24.370> you<00:06:24.460> have<00:06:24.639> up<00:06:24.789> on

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
very close especially if you have up on

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.309 
very close especially if you have up on
the<00:06:25.000> 550d<00:06:25.900> you<00:06:26.410> can<00:06:26.620> get<00:06:26.800> that

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:27.319 
the 550d you can get that

00:06:27.319 --> 00:06:30.369 
the 550d you can get that
1.6<00:06:28.009> times<00:06:28.279> zoom<00:06:28.610> you<00:06:29.089> can<00:06:29.240> get<00:06:29.389> really<00:06:29.899> up

00:06:30.369 --> 00:06:30.379 
1.6 times zoom you can get really up

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:36.489 
1.6 times zoom you can get really up
close<00:06:30.649> to<00:06:31.610> your<00:06:32.119> mortal<00:06:32.509> Oh<00:06:35.229> perfect

00:06:36.489 --> 00:06:36.499 
close to your mortal Oh perfect

00:06:36.499 --> 00:06:39.010 
close to your mortal Oh perfect
so<00:06:36.919> there<00:06:37.249> you<00:06:37.339> go<00:06:37.490> the<00:06:37.969> base<00:06:38.240> portrait<00:06:38.839> lanes

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:39.020 
so there you go the base portrait lanes

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.019 
so there you go the base portrait lanes
that<00:06:39.169> you<00:06:39.289> can<00:06:39.469> possibly<00:06:39.619> get<00:06:39.979> I<00:06:40.189> would<00:06:40.610> say<00:06:40.789> is

00:06:41.019 --> 00:06:41.029 
that you can possibly get I would say is
