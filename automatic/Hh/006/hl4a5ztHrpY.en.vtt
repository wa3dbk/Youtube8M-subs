to<00:02:12.860> buy<00:02:13.040> a<00:02:13.069> platform<00:02:13.730> which<00:02:13.910> is<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.180> boat<00:02:14.330> and

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
to buy a platform which is the boat and

water so let me I fractured a lot of
problem<00:03:55.540> with<00:03:55.870> the<00:03:55.959> block<00:03:56.140> mass<00:03:56.350> because<00:03:56.950> it

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
problem with the block mass because it

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:00.449 
problem with the block mass because it
gets<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.250> hot<00:03:57.870> when<00:03:58.870> Viking<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.350> done<00:03:59.560> is<00:04:00.190> this

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:00.459 
gets so hot when Viking is done is this

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.449 
gets so hot when Viking is done is this
is<00:04:00.610> actually<00:04:00.760> a<00:04:01.000> metallic<00:04:01.570> and<00:04:02.250> some<00:04:03.250> of<00:04:03.370> the

00:04:03.449 --> 00:04:03.459 
is actually a metallic and some of the

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:05.880 
is actually a metallic and some of the
metallic<00:04:04.000> material<00:04:04.780> actually<00:04:05.170> flex<00:04:05.470> sunlight

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
metallic material actually flex sunlight

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.070
