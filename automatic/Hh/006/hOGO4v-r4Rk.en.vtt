00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.250
 in that opportunity 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.260
 we are going to see the first case of factorization of the chapter of 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:11.449
 factorial decomposition 

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:14.449
 what is called common factor 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:16.279
 the second cis 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.279
 let's go make them the next expression 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.380
 squared 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.069
 You have to be the same 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:32.829
 we have the common factor that if the letter a number that is repeated in each 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:33.940
 one of the terms 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.649
 and is that in his inner game 

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:37.640
 and this is our second term 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.210
 your dark ask 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.520
 the letter art 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250
 the first one is repeated 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.000
 like the second one then I can say that our common factor is the letter 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:52.220
 and we say every 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.770
 we desist quesquÃ©n 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.770
 alive 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.800
 each said terms 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.710
 fifteen 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.319
 this is football critical of the letter 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.560
 how would we stay then 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.140
 employment sence first term is framed within we are writing here 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.080
 squared 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.420
 sorin 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.420
 the common factor that this 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.760
 as we know squared it is as if we had 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.480
 suu kyi 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.430
 the common factor that is 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.350
 well and criticize a market 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.180
 when the denominator 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.310
 initially 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.140
 this one that the fifth 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.140
 local industries as part of the response 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.640
 the plus sign 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.380
 which is in the middle of the two terms 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.430
 and when we place 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.270
 in this position 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.520
 and now comes second term 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.719
 what is 2 a 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.019
 pink 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.019
 and we divide it between common factor that is 

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.209
 then synthetic the merado culminates the so-called times to be listed 

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:23.699
 this 2 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:26.699
 the same and we put troops that the answer 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:32.659
 so I can say 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.660
 squared tiles 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.359
 is equal 

00:02:37.359 --> 00:02:38.699
 maltos 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:40.629
 and this one 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:43.629
 Our answer 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.989
 However 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.639
 for more confusion we are going to make precise chiche 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 exercises 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:03.980
 in that opportunity 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.980
 we are going to break down the following expression 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.239
 we have 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.239
 i maybe 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.619
 + 20 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:26.619
 We also crisis 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:38.119
 here would be the fourth 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:40.809
 then the same as in the first exercise 

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.429
 we have to criticize what he 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:46.279
 within the terms and what is the common factor 

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:50.349
 then we have that in addition to in we do not have first present in 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.719
 first term and more than what we present second term 

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:57.109
 between these municipalities of Puerto Rico a state of siege 

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.109
 themselves 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:10.989
 choclan film operation 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:13.769
 barbecue 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:14.680
 chagas 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:17.680
 that the outside 

00:04:18.379 --> 00:04:21.779
 quinteros the text 11 

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:24.779
 and in this case they 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:31.770
 what would we have 

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.770
 I do not know the first term is 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.020
 x hamas factor of performances krivoshapka 

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:45.199
 x 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:51.930
 at 20 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.409
 on 

00:04:55.409 --> 00:04:58.409
 the common factor that is more beautiful 

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:06.550
 equalize 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
 abalde we can not criticize with abÃ¡s d 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.270
 and I would stay 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.270
 is this x that gave us 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:18.240
 We assume this division and place it as an integral part of the answer 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:21.839
 in five minutes 

00:05:21.839 --> 00:05:26.239
 is the medium that our terms of originals we put in this 

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.289
 position 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:31.289
 and now all the second term 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:39.999
 lully alive 

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.999
 Carlos Ben 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:48.789
 according to serrat in parentheses 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:52.860
 as synthetic the numerator 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.089
 the denominator 

00:05:54.089 --> 00:05:57.089
 james b we would be the letter 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.550
 it issues more than one cost is this division 

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.550
 the rise we place on the part of the answer p 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.869
 what would they have 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:09.860
 We should 

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:14.900
 x lover factor - in this clumsy lover would equal more of it 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:19.710
 x - m 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:21.029
 and that would be our after
