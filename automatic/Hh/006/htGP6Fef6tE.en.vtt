00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
the thing that goes underneath you know

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.580 
the thing that goes underneath you know
so<00:03:04.430> yes<00:03:04.730> usually<00:03:05.030> you<00:03:05.480> see<00:03:05.660> that's<00:03:05.810> -<00:03:05.959> exactly

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
so yes usually you see that's - exactly

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.979 
so yes usually you see that's - exactly
so<00:03:06.890> now<00:03:07.070> you're<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.670> dividing<00:03:08.000> so<00:03:08.810> it's

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
so now you're just dividing so it's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.890 
so now you're just dividing so it's
forcing<00:03:09.530> you<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:09.950> be<00:03:10.220> organized<00:03:10.700> before<00:03:11.060> this

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
forcing you to be organized before this

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.360 
forcing you to be organized before this
shelf<00:03:12.170> would<00:03:12.290> probably<00:03:12.709> be<00:03:12.860> a<00:03:12.890> mess<00:03:13.130> with

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
shelf would probably be a mess with

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.800 
shelf would probably be a mess with
things<00:03:13.520> toppling<00:03:14.090> over<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.390> right<00:03:14.570> another

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
things toppling over all right another

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.530 
things toppling over all right another
now<00:03:15.470> your<00:03:15.850> compartmentalizing<00:03:16.850> your

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
now your compartmentalizing your

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.050 
now your compartmentalizing your
organizing<00:03:17.989> bicolor<00:03:18.650> rather<00:03:19.489> than<00:03:19.760> storing

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
organizing bicolor rather than storing
