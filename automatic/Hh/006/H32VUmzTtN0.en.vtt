I<00:00:48.030> prepared<00:00:48.750> this<00:00:48.989> chart<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.680> called<00:00:49.920> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
I prepared this chart it's called a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.670 
I prepared this chart it's called a
magic<00:00:50.399> keyboard<00:00:50.850> chart<00:00:51.180> I<00:00:51.530> don't<00:00:52.530> know<00:00:52.590> how

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
magic keyboard chart I don't know how

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.310 
magic keyboard chart I don't know how
well<00:00:52.890> you<00:00:53.010> can<00:00:53.129> see<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.730> it<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.840> designed

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
well you can see it but it it's designed

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.250 
well you can see it but it it's designed
to<00:00:55.440> slip<00:00:55.739> behind<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.280> keyboard<00:00:56.579> and<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.750> what

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
to slip behind the keyboard and so what

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.040 
to slip behind the keyboard and so what
it<00:00:58.379> does<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.739> it<00:00:58.770> slips<00:00:59.340> right<00:00:59.670> behind<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
it does is it slips right behind the

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.840 
it does is it slips right behind the
keyboard<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.739> stands<00:01:02.100> there<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.989> it<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.850> line

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
keyboard and stands there and it I line

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.030 
keyboard and stands there and it I line
up<00:01:05.880> see<00:01:06.510> on<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:07.020> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.260> chart<00:01:07.650> will<00:01:07.799> show<00:01:07.830> you

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
up see on the on the chart will show you

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.510 
up see on the on the chart will show you
there's<00:01:08.310> a<00:01:08.400> chart<00:01:08.700> name<00:01:09.390> c<00:01:09.780> d<00:01:10.140> e<00:01:10.380> f<00:01:10.740> g<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.250> so<00:01:11.400> on

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
there's a chart name c d e f g and so on

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
there's a chart name c d e f g and so on
and<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.390> is<00:01:12.570> a<00:01:12.600> trouble<00:01:12.930> cleft<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
and this is a trouble cleft for the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.200 
and this is a trouble cleft for the
right<00:01:13.740> hand<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.100> is<00:01:14.220> a<00:01:14.250> bass<00:01:14.549> clef<00:01:14.880> for<00:01:15.090> the

right hand this is a bass clef for the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.830 
right hand this is a bass clef for the
left<00:01:16.020> hand<00:01:16.259> so<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> line<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.549> sea<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.270> with

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
left hand so I line up the sea with with

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.410 
left hand so I line up the sea with with
middle<00:01:19.170> C<00:01:19.380> there<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.830> then<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.939> shows<00:01:21.180> me

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
middle C there and then that shows me

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.390 
middle C there and then that shows me
exactly<00:01:21.540> what<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.380> notes<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.799> but<00:01:23.070> more

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
importantly how they relate to the notes

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.640 
importantly how they relate to the notes
on<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.130> staff<00:01:26.369> ok<00:01:26.820> for<00:01:27.570> example<00:01:28.020> if<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.229> go<00:01:28.439> up

to f or g or a i can see on the on the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.990 
to f or g or a i can see on the on the
staff<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:37.350> note<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.610> keyboard

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
staff that note a on the keyboard

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.810 
staff that note a on the keyboard
relates<00:01:39.390> to<00:01:39.600> that<00:01:39.750> note<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.409> staff<00:01:40.680> be<00:01:41.579> on

relates to that note on the staff be on

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.020 
relates to that note on the staff be on
the<00:01:41.939> keyboard<00:01:42.329> relates<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.049> b-line<00:01:44.030> see

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
the keyboard relates to that b-line see
