how about if I invent SuperDuper
stretchy<00:02:53.460> shoes<00:02:53.910> that<00:02:54.150> grow<00:02:54.330> too<00:02:54.390> even<00:02:55.380> when

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
stretchy shoes that grow too even when

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.970 
stretchy shoes that grow too even when
I'm<00:02:55.650> 9<00:02:55.950> or<00:02:56.280> 10<00:02:56.640> or<00:02:56.670> even<00:02:57.180> as<00:02:57.720> insult<00:02:58.110> no<00:02:58.770> matter

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
I'm 9 or 10 or even as insult no matter

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.100 
I'm 9 or 10 or even as insult no matter
how<00:02:59.190> big<00:02:59.430> I<00:02:59.580> get<00:02:59.850> my<00:03:00.180> stretchy<00:03:00.570> shoes<00:03:00.900> will

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
how big I get my stretchy shoes will

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.260 
how big I get my stretchy shoes will
stretch<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.500> grow<00:03:01.590> too<00:03:01.709> and<00:03:02.220> that's<00:03:02.910> my

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
stretch and grow too and that's my

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:08.450 
stretch and grow too and that's my
super-duper-ooper-schmooper<00:03:03.930> big<00:03:05.450> idea
