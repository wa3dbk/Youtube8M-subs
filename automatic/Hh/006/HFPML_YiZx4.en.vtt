00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
and went down and yeah that's how I

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.200

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
yeah well I've already thought of that

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.649 
yeah well I've already thought of that
and<00:01:26.800> when<00:01:27.580> I<00:01:27.670> came<00:01:27.729> down<00:01:28.060> nearly<00:01:28.270> have<00:01:28.420> a<00:01:28.479> date

and when I came down nearly have a date
I<00:01:28.690> haven't<00:01:28.960> looked<00:01:29.200> it<00:01:29.350> was<00:01:29.409> loads<00:01:29.650> of<00:01:29.770> people

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
I haven't looked it was loads of people

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.370 
I haven't looked it was loads of people
down<00:01:30.220> there<00:01:30.400> but<00:01:30.880> apparently<00:01:31.300> all<00:01:32.080> of<00:01:32.290> that

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
down there but apparently all of that

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.469 
down there but apparently all of that
now<00:01:32.530> all<00:01:32.710> the<00:01:32.740> way<00:01:32.890> to<00:01:32.950> see<00:01:33.310> their<00:01:33.550> beach<00:01:34.090> all

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
now all the way to see their beach all

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.420 
now all the way to see their beach all
the<00:01:34.540> way<00:01:34.750> down<00:01:34.960> that's<00:01:35.590> now<00:01:35.799> scheduled<00:01:36.250> land

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:36.430 
the way down that's now scheduled land
