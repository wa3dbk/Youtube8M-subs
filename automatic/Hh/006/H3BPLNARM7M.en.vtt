00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Well, before the start of this video for 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 new channel outback sonax a in 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.519
 which you can find a lot 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.280
 interesting videos about sharar 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:13.410
 subscribe link in description 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.809
 we all watched smeshariki kindest 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.190
 and educational cartoon childhood 2d 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.350
 the format was liked by many viewers 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.300
 how many episodes can you recall 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.189
 which even an adult could 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.160
 to think about and change something 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.560
 life indescribable beauty cartoons and 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:32.759
 wonderful music did 2d series 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.680
 very attractive however should 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.260
 foreign traditions project started 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.540
 do with 3d format consistently from the main 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.680
 heroes and acacias disappeared appeared 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.960
 other characters 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.430
 new adventures and pin completely 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 destroyed the ideals of the original 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.110
 cartoon philosophical meaning each of 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.789
 a series of smesharikov was lost and hidden for 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.489
 a huge proportion of educational or 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.350
 social content and great prologue 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.420
 is over it's time to find out for you 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.640
 a terrible secret indeed 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.289
 strange that the world of smeshariki never 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.660
 was other creatures 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.000
 a couple of times they flew to them little mouse mission and 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.490
 other characters worth noting that 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.280
 connection with the outside world smeshariki there but 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.439
 it is not known whether this world itself exists 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.570
 because apart from the world of others laugh 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.369
 locations we do not show well and not 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.340
 worth hiding what the characters are 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.560
 internet they often walk shararame game 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.689
 made based on this cartoon but 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.759
 here another theory suggests itself 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.340
 Smeshariki actually live in 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.860
 the otherworldly universe is about it 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.380
 we were told a series of bagel baron 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.960
 somehow magically got into 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 another galaxy is incomprehensible how but got 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.560
 does this mean that the characters 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.880
 exists in a place where the laws of physics 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.729
 just missing 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.540
 to that is an example of a series with explicit magic 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.850
 manifestations 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.040
 like a magic wand or generous 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 the sky seems like a natural environment 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.730
 adjusts to life without balls 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.770
 animals themselves do not stick to them 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.750
 you except for the falling kopatycha 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 all of 5 but for some reason, celebrating something 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.920
 new year colors too controversial 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.550
 so all my 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 speculation 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.750
 but still the truth is somewhere near and 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.119
 mysterious transformation lack 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.010
 laws of physics fencing from the main 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.760
 world but at the same time connecting to the world 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.980
 the web 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.140
 it seems this is the only frame theory 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.180
 never get any evidence 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.670
 let's make a big science contribution 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.330
 many minds struggled with it but nothing 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.400
 and did not come up 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.370
 probably should choose another tactic 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.250
 thinking how do you think you will write for and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.159
 conspiracy theories and perhaps this problem 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:37.220
 will be soon resolved 

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:44.510
 And finally, a couple of strange scenes from 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:45.650
 Smesharikov yes I more fca than you all 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.090
 put together 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:03:08.599
 my friend in the car you what of these of 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:03:14.420
 which of these is incorrectly filled go 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:16.069
 copy here by the way about the dash and i don't 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.489
 receive and not send 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:22.280
 I am indignant at a bunch of my whole package 

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.190
 stank muriel adam and what did you have 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.680
 The parcel is important. Itâ€™s all gone. 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.459
 somehow marinade i do n't 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.310
 leave 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.620
 packages must be sorted at least 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:38.690
 those in which there is a marina and onslaught 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.290
 well, and how such conditions work up 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.290
 crazy
