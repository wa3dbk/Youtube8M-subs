this<00:00:00.719> is<00:00:00.870> a<00:00:00.900> six-inch<00:00:01.439> utility<00:00:02.280> fighter<00:00:02.550> that

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:02.730 
this is a six-inch utility fighter that

this is a six-inch utility fighter that
I<00:00:02.879> make<00:00:03.090> out<00:00:03.300> of<00:00:03.480> CPM<00:00:04.230> three<00:00:04.529> V<00:00:04.770> and<00:00:05.009> L<00:00:05.190> Max<00:00:05.460> and

00:00:06.099 --> 00:00:06.109 
I make out of CPM three V and L Max and

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:08.750 
I make out of CPM three V and L Max and
everybody<00:00:07.109> understands<00:00:07.950> that<00:00:08.010> three<00:00:08.429> V<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.730> a

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
everybody understands that three V is a

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.360 
everybody understands that three V is a
very<00:00:09.059> durable<00:00:09.300> steel<00:00:09.809> but<00:00:10.170> L<00:00:10.650> max<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.130> maybe

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
very durable steel but L max is maybe

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.820 
very durable steel but L max is maybe
not<00:00:11.460> as<00:00:11.700> well<00:00:11.880> understood<00:00:12.440> it's<00:00:13.440> a<00:00:13.559> stainless

the<00:00:19.260> first<00:00:19.590> steel<00:00:20.070> you<00:00:20.279> would<00:00:20.430> think<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.789> as

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
the first steel you would think of as

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.090 
the first steel you would think of as
being<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.539> most<00:00:21.779> durable<00:00:22.289> stainless<00:00:22.619> steel

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
being the most durable stainless steel

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.880 
being the most durable stainless steel
but<00:00:23.310> it<00:00:23.460> is<00:00:23.699> remarkably<00:00:24.390> durable<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:25.080> with<00:00:25.859> a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
but it is remarkably durable and with a

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.259 
but it is remarkably durable and with a
good<00:00:26.130> heat<00:00:26.369> treat<00:00:26.609> it<00:00:26.699> has<00:00:26.820> good<00:00:27.119> edge

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
good heat treat it has good edge

good heat treat it has good edge
retention<00:00:27.480> as<00:00:27.930> well<00:00:28.140> so<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.590> purpose<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.039> this

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189

durability of the steel now it's a it's

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:35.750 
durability of the steel now it's a it's
pretty<00:00:34.649> easy<00:00:34.829> to<00:00:35.100> make<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.280> knife<00:00:35.579> that's

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
pretty easy to make a knife that's

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.700 
pretty easy to make a knife that's
extremely<00:00:36.480> durable<00:00:36.660> just<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.290> making<00:00:37.590> it

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
extremely durable just by making it

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.549 
extremely durable just by making it
extremely<00:00:38.070> thick<00:00:38.550> but<00:00:38.850> this<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> this<00:00:40.290> is

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
extremely thick but this is a this is

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.500 
extremely thick but this is a this is
this<00:00:40.950> was<00:00:41.160> taking<00:00:41.399> down<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.640> 20<00:00:41.940> thousands<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this was taking down the 20 thousands of

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.139 
this was taking down the 20 thousands of
an<00:00:42.629> inch<00:00:42.809> edge<00:00:43.079> thickness<00:00:43.440> before<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.760> before

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
an inch edge thickness before the before

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.190 
an inch edge thickness before the before
sharpening<00:00:45.719> and<00:00:45.899> it's<00:00:46.020> it's<00:00:46.620> currently<00:00:48.200> it's

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
sharpening and it's it's currently it's

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.549 
sharpening and it's it's currently it's
currently<00:00:49.559> little<00:00:50.520> under<00:00:50.760> 30<00:00:50.960> thousand<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
currently little under 30 thousand so

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.420 
currently little under 30 thousand so
this<00:00:52.710> is<00:00:52.860> not<00:00:53.010> a<00:00:53.070> thick<00:00:53.550> knife<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.199> so<00:00:55.199> I<00:00:55.430> cut

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
this is not a thick knife and so I cut

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.529 
this is not a thick knife and so I cut
some<00:00:56.550> cardboard<00:00:57.030> just<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> kind<00:00:57.510> of

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
some cardboard just to kind of

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.330 
some cardboard just to kind of
illustrate<00:00:57.660> that<00:00:58.140> you<00:00:58.350> know<00:00:58.800> when<00:00:58.949> you've<00:00:59.129> got

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
illustrate that you know when you've got

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.080 
illustrate that you know when you've got
a<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.789> reasonably<00:01:00.600> thin<00:01:00.899> knife<00:01:01.170> that<00:01:01.760> it<00:01:02.760> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
a a reasonably thin knife that it you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.820 
a a reasonably thin knife that it you
know<00:01:03.180> it's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> useful<00:01:03.780> cutting<00:01:04.320> thing<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.710> not

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
know it's a useful cutting thing or not

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.679 
know it's a useful cutting thing or not
just<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.489> know<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.270> sharpened

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
just you know it's not just a sharpened

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.200 
just you know it's not just a sharpened
pry<00:01:06.869> bar<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.260> reasonably<00:01:07.890> reasonably<00:01:08.880> sharp

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
pry bar it's reasonably reasonably sharp

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.429 
pry bar it's reasonably reasonably sharp
so<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:11.159> grab<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.400> big<00:01:11.640> hammer<00:01:11.909> here<00:01:12.439> you're

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so you grab a big hammer here you're

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.999 
so you grab a big hammer here you're
going<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> see<00:01:13.890> a<00:01:14.750> L<00:01:15.750> max<00:01:16.080> at<00:01:16.470> Rockwell

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
going to see a L max at Rockwell

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.060 
going to see a L max at Rockwell
hardness<00:01:17.280> 60<00:01:17.970> that's<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.960> relatively<00:01:19.380> thin<00:01:19.830> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
hardness 60 that's a relatively thin I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.640 
hardness 60 that's a relatively thin I
cut<00:01:20.490> through<00:01:20.729> a<00:01:20.759> cinder<00:01:21.090> block<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:22.439> mean

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
cut through a cinder block and I mean

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.929 
cut through a cinder block and I mean
there'll<00:01:22.799> be<00:01:22.830> some<00:01:23.100> edge<00:01:23.250> damage<00:01:23.490> but<00:01:23.820> it's

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
there'll be some edge damage but it's

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.760 
there'll be some edge damage but it's
not<00:01:24.119> it's<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> be<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.049> lot<00:01:25.259> less<00:01:25.500> than<00:01:25.710> you

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
not it's going to be a lot less than you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.109 
not it's going to be a lot less than you
would<00:01:26.009> expect<00:01:26.159> particularly<00:01:26.939> for<00:01:27.090> a

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
would expect particularly for a

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:44.440 
would expect particularly for a
stainless<00:01:27.600> steel

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.620 

alright<00:01:45.450> so<00:01:45.690> that<00:01:45.720> is<00:01:47.600> cleave<00:01:48.600> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
alright so that is cleave that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.310 
alright so that is cleave that
cinderblock<00:01:49.470> in<00:01:49.680> half<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:51.020> when<00:01:52.020> you<00:01:52.140> look

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
cinderblock in half and when you look

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.969 
cinderblock in half and when you look
you'll<00:01:52.740> see<00:01:53.090> there's<00:01:54.090> some<00:01:54.560> they<00:01:55.560> just<00:01:55.650> kind

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you'll see there's some they just kind

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.680 
you'll see there's some they just kind
of<00:01:56.040> scratched<00:01:56.370> up<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:56.850> you<00:01:56.970> don't<00:01:57.150> see<00:01:57.450> any

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:57.690 
of scratched up but you don't see any

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:59.990 
of scratched up but you don't see any
great<00:01:58.200> huge<00:01:58.530> chips<00:01:58.890> like<00:01:59.100> that<00:01:59.280> that

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
great huge chips like that that

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.690 
great huge chips like that that
secondary<00:02:00.420> edge<00:02:00.630> bevel<00:02:01.229> is<00:02:01.380> still<00:02:02.100> intact<00:02:02.460> it

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
secondary edge bevel is still intact it

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.940 
secondary edge bevel is still intact it
didn't<00:02:02.940> go<00:02:03.030> above<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.960> edge<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.800> let's

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
didn't go above the the edge and let's

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.950 
didn't go above the the edge and let's
sharpen<00:02:05.190> 20<00:02:05.760> degrees<00:02:06.090> per<00:02:06.330> side<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.810> not

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
sharpen 20 degrees per side this is not

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.460 
sharpen 20 degrees per side this is not
an<00:02:07.259> obtuse<00:02:07.619> edge<00:02:08.390> so<00:02:09.390> here<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:10.020> got<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.200> blade

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
an obtuse edge so here you got a blade

an obtuse edge so here you got a blade
that's<00:02:10.679> that's<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.220> little<00:02:11.640> under<00:02:11.880> 30

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
that's that's a little under 30

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.000 
that's that's a little under 30
thousands<00:02:12.690> behind<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> edge<00:02:13.380> and<00:02:13.770> a

thousands behind the edge and a
sharpened<00:02:14.400> 20<00:02:14.670> degrees<00:02:14.970> per<00:02:15.180> side<00:02:15.420> and<00:02:15.720> it's

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
sharpened 20 degrees per side and it's

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.720 
sharpened 20 degrees per side and it's
just<00:02:16.500> cut<00:02:16.680> a<00:02:16.709> cinderblock<00:02:17.160> and<00:02:17.520> it's<00:02:17.640> a

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
just cut a cinderblock and it's a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.250 
just cut a cinderblock and it's a
stainless<00:02:18.209> steel<00:02:18.510> which<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:19.020> me<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.230> very

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
stainless steel which to me is very

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:42.150 
stainless steel which to me is very
impressive<00:02:22.489> on<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.520> fruit<00:02:23.790> tip<00:02:24.030> first

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.010 

right<00:02:43.160> now<00:02:43.280> that<00:02:43.430> was<00:02:43.550> just<00:02:43.790> run<00:02:44.090> tip<00:02:44.750> first

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:45.020 
right now that was just run tip first

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:47.550 
right now that was just run tip first
through<00:02:45.950> a<00:02:45.980> cinder<00:02:46.400> block<00:02:46.430> and<00:02:46.850> you<00:02:47.090> can<00:02:47.270> see

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
through a cinder block and you can see

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:50.920 
through a cinder block and you can see
you<00:02:48.560> focus<00:02:48.890> on<00:02:49.010> that<00:02:49.130> point<00:02:49.370> that<00:02:50.330> point<00:02:50.750> did

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
you focus on that point that point did

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.960 
you focus on that point that point did
not<00:02:51.080> roll<00:02:51.650> over<00:02:51.680> that's<00:02:52.160> a<00:02:52.250> fine<00:02:52.520> that's<00:02:52.850> a

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
not roll over that's a fine that's a

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.420 
not roll over that's a fine that's a
thin<00:02:53.210> point<00:02:53.450> and<00:02:53.990> it<00:02:54.380> didn't<00:02:54.620> roll<00:02:54.800> over<00:02:54.830> it's

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
thin point and it didn't roll over it's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.140 
thin point and it didn't roll over it's
not<00:02:55.670> I<00:02:55.970> mean<00:02:56.300> it's<00:02:56.480> it's<00:02:57.080> it's<00:02:57.410> still<00:02:57.860> quite

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
not I mean it's it's it's still quite

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.320 
not I mean it's it's it's still quite
stabby

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
stabby

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.670 
stabby
now<00:02:59.570> there's<00:02:59.750> a<00:02:59.810> there's<00:03:00.020> a<00:03:00.200> little<00:03:00.380> chip<00:03:00.530> in

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
now there's a there's a little chip in

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.040 
now there's a there's a little chip in
the<00:03:00.770> edge<00:03:00.920> there<00:03:01.220> but<00:03:01.250> I<00:03:01.490> mean<00:03:01.700> overall<00:03:02.050> that's

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
the edge there but I mean overall that's

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:05.190 
the edge there but I mean overall that's
remarkably<00:03:03.710> little<00:03:04.130> edge<00:03:04.490> damage

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
remarkably little edge damage

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.990 
remarkably little edge damage
particularly<00:03:06.200> for<00:03:06.380> a<00:03:06.410> stainless<00:03:06.950> steel<00:03:07.000> and

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:08.000 
particularly for a stainless steel and

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.940 
particularly for a stainless steel and
that's<00:03:08.210> what<00:03:08.450> I<00:03:08.480> think<00:03:08.570> is<00:03:08.840> unique<00:03:08.990> about<00:03:09.320> Lmax

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
that's what I think is unique about Lmax

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:11.950 
that's what I think is unique about Lmax
is<00:03:10.190> that<00:03:10.400> for<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> you<00:03:11.240> know<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.390> stainless<00:03:11.930> steel

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
is that for a you know a stainless steel

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.130 
is that for a you know a stainless steel
a<00:03:12.410> particularly<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.580> that's<00:03:14.020> 1.7<00:03:15.020> percent

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
a particularly one that's 1.7 percent

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.500 
a particularly one that's 1.7 percent
carbon<00:03:15.560> and<00:03:15.830> three<00:03:16.280> percent<00:03:16.610> vanadium<00:03:16.700> it<00:03:17.360> has

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
carbon and three percent vanadium it has

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.750 
carbon and three percent vanadium it has
pretty<00:03:17.720> good<00:03:17.930> edge<00:03:18.050> retention<00:03:18.280> that's<00:03:19.280> a<00:03:19.550> you

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
pretty good edge retention that's a you

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.430 
pretty good edge retention that's a you
know<00:03:19.850> it's<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.240> high<00:03:20.390> carbide<00:03:20.900> steel<00:03:21.170> that's

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
know it's a high carbide steel that's

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.380 
know it's a high carbide steel that's
that's<00:03:21.740> good<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.130> abrasive<00:03:22.370> applications<00:03:23.180> to

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:23.390 
that's good and abrasive applications to

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.410 
that's good and abrasive applications to
see<00:03:23.630> a<00:03:23.840> stainless<00:03:24.830> steel<00:03:24.860> it<00:03:25.250> has<00:03:25.280> that<00:03:25.790> degree

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
see a stainless steel it has that degree

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.290 
see a stainless steel it has that degree
of<00:03:26.780> toughness<00:03:27.050> is<00:03:27.380> just<00:03:27.590> really<00:03:27.830> remarkable

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:28.300 
of toughness is just really remarkable

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:30.460 
of toughness is just really remarkable
that's<00:03:29.300> why<00:03:29.450> this<00:03:29.510> steel<00:03:29.870> is<00:03:29.900> becoming<00:03:30.290> more

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
that's why this steel is becoming more

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.540 
that's why this steel is becoming more
popular<00:03:30.680> in<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.490> certain<00:03:31.850> heart<00:03:32.120> use<00:03:32.300> knives
