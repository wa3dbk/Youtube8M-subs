this method before we start I would like
to<00:01:09.150> show<00:01:09.570> you<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:10.110> root<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.280> run<00:01:11.480> this<00:01:12.480> is

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to show you the root of the run this is

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.570 
to show you the root of the run this is
the<00:01:12.780> map<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.380> area<00:01:13.410> that<00:01:14.100> we're<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.490> to

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
the map of the area that we're going to

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.960 
the map of the area that we're going to
be<00:01:14.670> farming<00:01:15.350> as<00:01:16.350> you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.770> see<00:01:17.070> at<00:01:17.370> the<00:01:17.670> start

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
be farming as you can see at the start

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.350 
be farming as you can see at the start
point<00:01:18.300> and<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.320> is<00:01:19.530> V<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.460> where<00:01:20.760> we're

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
point and this is V this is where we're

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.130 
point and this is V this is where we're
going<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.690> be<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:22.080> spawning<00:01:22.650> and<00:01:23.720> there<00:01:24.720> are<00:01:24.930> two

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
going to be a spawning and there are two

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.950 
going to be a spawning and there are two
possible<00:01:25.710> spawn<00:01:26.490> points<00:01:27.000> of<00:01:27.180> respond<00:01:27.750> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
possible spawn points of respond and

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.760 
possible spawn points of respond and
chests<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:29.210> none<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.240> them<00:01:30.540> are<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:31.290> hundred

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
chests and none of them are a hundred

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.230 
chests and none of them are a hundred
percent<00:01:32.100> sure<00:01:32.870> that<00:01:33.870> the<00:01:34.140> chest<00:01:34.800> is<00:01:35.040> there<00:01:35.340> but

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
percent sure that the chest is there but

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.340 
percent sure that the chest is there but
the<00:01:37.170> chance<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.860> high<00:01:38.190> enough<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.730> that<00:01:39.690> will

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
the chance is high enough and that will

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.540 
the chance is high enough and that will
make<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.680> worth<00:01:41.280> farming<00:01:42.620> our<00:01:43.620> route<00:01:43.980> is<00:01:44.250> going

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
make it worth farming our route is going

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.940 
make it worth farming our route is going
to<00:01:44.640> include<00:01:44.970> both<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.500> possible<00:01:46.500> spawn

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
to include both the possible spawn

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.850 
to include both the possible spawn
points<00:01:47.430> and<00:01:47.630> obviously<00:01:48.630> we're<00:01:48.990> gonna<00:01:49.230> start

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
points and obviously we're gonna start

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.320 
points and obviously we're gonna start
at<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.310> blue<00:01:50.940> dot<00:01:51.330> on<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.660> map<00:01:55.580> okay<00:01:56.580> so<00:01:57.060> let's

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
at the blue dot on the map okay so let's

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.760 
at the blue dot on the map okay so let's
get<00:01:57.480> into<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:57.930> game<00:01:58.190> I<00:01:59.360> have<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.540> know<00:02:00.660> that
