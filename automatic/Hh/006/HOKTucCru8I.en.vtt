00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.370
 hello everybody here but levy are good 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.830
 come to another video and not 22 of us 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.380
 we have our our my first game 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.790
 play on black ops is to employ both 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.370
 black chock options 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.990
 I'm here with the gun in three sets this 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.779
 is the first weapon the first on 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.730
 coming that we won we have 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 access this in this game is this game case 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.520
 you do not know it was made available 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.520
 tonight from midnight to 23 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.300
 30 here in portugal we already have the 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:43.559
 possibility to play and this was the 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:45.120
 wear and I can say is first 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.480
 First place I can say 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:55.309
 that this map is to note 2025 the option 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:57.780
 futuristic game owner was kobe south 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:04.680
 can say more 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:06.570
 the faithful are faithful to the one who noticed that the 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.750
 option is not only a more futuristic option 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:15.930
 as it is obvious and has not changed practically 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.830
 Let's just say it was just text and 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.710
 secondary and is quite pleasant 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.710
 I think that work is what we 're going to talk about. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.710
 more only first options than what I 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:33.390
 shot of this this game first options 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.329
 I have this game is that it is 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:39.030
 fairly fluid is rather more 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:42.270
 fast that the black ops 1 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:48.420
 we have here a park that is the dexter 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:49.500
 net that helps us a lot obstacles 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.799
 more quickly 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.829
 You can see it is easier to 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:57.899
 to buy assets increase the sound is there 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.170
 even in 1931 throughout the stretch of the game 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.299
 much faster than firefox 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.780
 anyway this one with this stay 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.599
 faster in the afternoon 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.979
 I do not know I do not tell me you have the 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.569
 live comment 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.980
 but it does not matter now you already know that 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:17.720
 It's just that I 'm going to play very badly and it's 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.050
 completely normal also suffers from 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.050
 that 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.340
 therefore they were able to make 11 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:33.590
 graphic improvement I think I did in the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.700
 I think they have made a good improvement. 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.360
 and did so in order to 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.750
 that computers a little weaker 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:48.019
 or else it already comforts the generation 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.180
 playstation 3 and xbox 360 get 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.239
 rescue is also at least 60 frames 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.010
 per second 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:57.799
 and I think the scene that a job 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:03:00.500
 solid for the first time has one is that 

00:02:57.799 --> 00:03:03.860
 feeling that I'm not playing a 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:07.130
 game that has been made or developed 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:09.019
 think of pleasing most of the 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:14.030
 consumers 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:16.549
 when I say this is even said that 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.769
 This was not developed for us. 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.380
 because I love with one of the things that the 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.720
 football in which I said at the time 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.630
 I was talking about the company plan that 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.209
 It was not good for anyone people 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.150
 upset with the game that is stopped 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:34.640
 play because it is weak and I am 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.190
 drinks and if in the case of 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.920
 w3 is that in the range of options we do not 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.030
 we have the 10 tricks we have a game 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.549
 who rewards who plays the goal and is 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.250
 hence perhaps France among those I am 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:53.030
 there are the trix schools we have in this 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.380
 if I think I know we 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:04:01.190
 we would need to kill is between 58 and three 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:05.400
 team players pass and up to 15 to 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:08.890
 being rewarded here is all just 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:12.190
 we are only compensated with our 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.610
 for our points or is that the 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:17.410
 points we make of shape is the 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.280
 attack the chosen 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.919
 up here is not that the points we 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:31.230
 we do that the points 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:31.230
 that we get access through 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.970
 beginning to say those points that we 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:38.890
 we do during the game in a row 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:43.570
 we are compensated with the cuts 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:46.300
 tracks and then we have to say that 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:49.600
 compensates for how I saw the spectrum of 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.240
 black ops 1 and we got pretty much off 

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.090
 would make a video showing which 

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.730
 are the trix cuts do we have access to 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.080
 here we have options is what I can 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.390
 say more 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.030
 I can say that this is going to be the game going 

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:06.820
 starting is definitely going to be a game 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.750
 will make me bring many games 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.040
 many videos when exposing the channel to 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.390
 explore all your points 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.390
 this price is more chan 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:24.610
 This is another video to use my 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:30.070
 first line 1st opinion is and is 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:32.320
 already making a shock and showed 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.770
 also that in a total of 1025 also 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:37.690
 we want to ask if you want 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.580
 extremes of cox 2 I'm thinking to do 

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.820
 it's going to be the game that I'm going to stay over 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:45.310
 in terms of distribution dying is 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:46.060
 no staff, and I do not need to train 

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:52.990
 enough 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:54.610
 It's the united states too and what I 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:57.039
 I can help 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:06:00.430
 I already said on twitter a lot 

00:05:57.039 --> 00:06:02.650
 time ago I would bring the 

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:07.060
 campaign of the capital and center will bring 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:10.150
 the men's campaign two options and 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.580
 bring the cup and also into zombies or 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.980
 I'm going to explore this 

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:16.770
 completely 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:18.300
 then all the rest is on the back we go 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:20.070
 Guys I promise that in a week 

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.180
 My, I'm already making this cut. 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:24.290
 positive 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:30.150
 I am already doing and I think the flex 

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:37.320
 50 or more and promised that one day I will 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:43.950
 to win here the Kenyans that we did 

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:46.050
 we are and 4a not only the state is that 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:48.480
 This time was not a big deal, but it's just 

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:51.090
 even if I can use my opinion to this 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:55.380
 It was the last one that is dead 

00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:57.720
 prestigious only that it is not and health for 

00:06:55.380 --> 00:07:00.450
 have been at issue is to evaluate 

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:03.810
 for me to continue to make the people of 

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:06.810
 content options both for gustavo 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:10.550
 big hug and this layout empanou 21 

00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:10.550
 this is prestigious size
