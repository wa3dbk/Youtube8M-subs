fakes custom G powers stuff that does
not<00:01:56.040> have<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.520> authentic<00:01:56.820> unique<00:01:57.360> DNA<00:01:57.810> code

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
not have the authentic unique DNA code

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810 
not have the authentic unique DNA code
so<00:01:58.710> it's<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.070> heat-sensitive

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
so it's a heat-sensitive

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.639 
so it's a heat-sensitive
ink<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.270> have<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.540> rub<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.780> or<00:02:01.049> blow<00:02:01.229> on<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.530> to

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
ink you have to rub it or blow on it to

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.830 
ink you have to rub it or blow on it to
get<00:02:01.740> it<00:02:01.890> hot<00:02:02.070> type<00:02:02.759> in<00:02:02.939> your<00:02:03.060> code<00:02:03.299> it's<00:02:03.540> an<00:02:03.630> 8

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
get it hot type in your code it's an 8

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.810 
get it hot type in your code it's an 8
digit<00:02:04.200> code<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.710> then<00:02:04.860> unleash<00:02:05.130> your<00:02:05.340> monster

missing<00:02:36.840> an<00:02:37.110> attribute<00:02:37.710> and<00:02:38.660> we're<00:02:39.660> not<00:02:39.750> sure

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
missing an attribute and we're not sure

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.710 
missing an attribute and we're not sure
if<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.200> G<00:02:40.380> power<00:02:40.650> on<00:02:40.830> those<00:02:41.090> is<00:02:42.090> accurate

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
if the G power on those is accurate

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.200 
if the G power on those is accurate
because<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:43.200> may<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.350> be<00:02:43.500> authentic<00:02:44.070> so<00:02:44.310> let's

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:45.210 
because it may not be authentic so let's

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:47.780 
because it may not be authentic so let's
go<00:02:45.390> ahead<00:02:45.450> and<00:02:45.690> open<00:02:45.870> this<00:02:46.230> sweet<00:02:46.920> packaging

that are gonna be included with this

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.040 
that are gonna be included with this
booster<00:03:10.820> looks<00:03:11.820> like<00:03:11.970> our<00:03:12.240> first<00:03:12.420> card<00:03:12.780> is

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
booster looks like our first card is

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.430 
booster looks like our first card is
called<00:03:13.320> shield<00:03:14.190> smash<00:03:14.780> says<00:03:15.780> played<00:03:16.050> during<00:03:16.260> a

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440

symbol for the gold gear down there you

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.430 
symbol for the gold gear down there you
add<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.740> G<00:03:29.010> power<00:03:29.220> boost<00:03:29.580> hunter<00:03:30.180> to<00:03:30.420> chaos<00:03:31.080> and

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:44.740 
my guess is a 750 or 790 750 okay so he

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:48.430 
is a 750 G if I camera can get that

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.309 
is a 750 G if I camera can get that
there<00:05:49.740> 750g<00:05:50.740> and<00:05:50.949> he<00:05:51.940> is<00:05:52.060> official<00:05:52.599> authentic
