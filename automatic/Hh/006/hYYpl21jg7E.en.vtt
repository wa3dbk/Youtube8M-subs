00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
losing weight as well ok so the basics

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.509 
losing weight as well ok so the basics
of<00:00:26.760> nutrition<00:00:27.920> first<00:00:28.920> we're<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> start

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
of nutrition first we're going to start

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.950 
of nutrition first we're going to start
with<00:00:29.840> macronutrients<00:00:30.840> there's<00:00:31.109> three<00:00:31.700> things

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:32.960 
with macronutrients there's three things

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.290 
with macronutrients there's three things
that<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.140> body<00:00:34.380> actually<00:00:34.770> needs<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:36.180> are

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
that your body actually needs that are

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.430 
that your body actually needs that are
separate<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.809> three<00:00:37.020> different<00:00:37.200> groups

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
separate in three different groups

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.970 
separate in three different groups
they're<00:00:38.190> called<00:00:38.430> macro<00:00:38.850> nutrients<00:00:39.660> vitamins

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980 
they're called macro nutrients vitamins

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.100 
they're called macro nutrients vitamins
and<00:00:40.980> minerals<00:00:41.520> if<00:00:41.760> you<00:00:42.390> see<00:00:42.570> me<00:00:42.690> looking<00:00:42.930> down

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and minerals if you see me looking down

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.299 
and minerals if you see me looking down
and<00:00:43.260> looking<00:00:43.469> down<00:00:43.590> at<00:00:43.710> notes<00:00:43.920> because<00:00:44.190> I'm

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:44.309 
and looking down at notes because I'm

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.529 
and looking down at notes because I'm
not<00:00:44.430> familiar<00:00:44.640> with<00:00:45.000> all<00:00:45.149> of<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.450> yet<00:00:45.629> so<00:00:47.539> we're

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
not familiar with all of it yet so we're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.900 
not familiar with all of it yet so we're
going<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.719> start<00:00:49.129> macronutrients<00:00:50.129> there

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
going to start macronutrients there

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.610 
going to start macronutrients there
carbs<00:00:51.600> fat<00:00:52.140> protein<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.399> fiber<00:00:54.350> will<00:00:55.350> start

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
carbs fat protein and fiber will start

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.400 
carbs fat protein and fiber will start
with<00:00:55.739> carbs<00:00:56.989> carbohydrates<00:00:57.989> you're<00:00:58.170> going<00:00:58.350> to

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
with carbs carbohydrates you're going to

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.000 
with carbs carbohydrates you're going to
one<00:00:58.949> about<00:00:59.190> 130<00:01:00.000> grams<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.660> day<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.289> an<00:01:01.469> average

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
one about 130 grams a day is an average

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.200 
one about 130 grams a day is an average
you<00:01:02.969> want<00:01:03.210> about<00:01:03.470> 45<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.610> 65<00:01:05.610> percent<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.119> your

you want about 45 to 65 percent of your
energy<00:01:06.720> should<00:01:07.110> come<00:01:07.409> from<00:01:07.799> carbs<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.580> you

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
energy should come from carbs so you

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.480 
energy should come from carbs so you
want<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> do<00:01:09.840> carbs<00:01:10.350> have<00:01:10.680> some<00:01:10.890> carbs<00:01:11.280> before

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
want to do carbs have some carbs before

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.700 
want to do carbs have some carbs before
you<00:01:11.760> do<00:01:11.909> your<00:01:11.939> workout<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.810> would<00:01:13.409> be<00:01:13.530> really

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
