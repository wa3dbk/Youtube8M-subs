00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you want to do it

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.880 
you want to do it
so<00:01:39.360> number<00:01:39.630> sixteen<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.110> really<00:01:40.409> important

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
so number sixteen is really important

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.399 
so number sixteen is really important
because<00:01:41.270> use<00:01:42.270> the<00:01:42.390> sixteen<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
because use the sixteen you have the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.399 
because use the sixteen you have the
eight<00:01:43.560> right<00:01:44.520> above<00:01:44.790> you<00:01:45.509> throw<00:01:45.840> by<00:01:45.990> accident

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
eight right above you throw by accident

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.670 
eight right above you throw by accident
sixteen<00:01:46.950> you<00:01:47.729> know<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:47.909> can<00:01:48.180> put<00:01:48.500> just<00:01:49.500> about

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
sixteen you know you can put just about

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.670 
sixteen you know you can put just about
number<00:01:50.220> eight<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:51.240> that's<00:01:51.479> a<00:01:51.570> good<00:01:51.750> trick<00:01:51.930> to

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
number eight so that's a good trick to

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.930 
number eight so that's a good trick to
work<00:01:52.860> through<00:01:53.100> your<00:01:53.369> dot<00:01:53.579> slash

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:04.570 

number<00:01:58.940> twelve<00:01:59.180> is<00:01:59.360> really<00:01:59.690> important<00:02:03.580> but

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
number twelve is really important but

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:10.920 
number twelve is really important but
don't<00:02:04.880> you<00:02:05.000> ever<00:02:05.060> forget<00:02:05.330> the<00:02:05.600> bullseye

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.720 

after<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.050> doubles<00:02:12.410> will<00:02:12.980> stop<00:02:13.190> focusing<00:02:13.460> on

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:13.730 
after the doubles will stop focusing on

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.030 
after the doubles will stop focusing on
triples<00:02:14.240> you<00:02:15.020> can<00:02:15.170> go<00:02:15.290> around<00:02:15.590> the<00:02:15.680> clock<00:02:15.830> with

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
triples you can go around the clock with

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.850 
triples you can go around the clock with

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.259 

after<00:02:58.709> that<00:02:58.860> you<00:02:59.250> can<00:02:59.430> start<00:02:59.549> focusing<00:02:59.940> on
