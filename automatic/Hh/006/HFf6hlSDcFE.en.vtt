00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.780
 beast and on which I was question 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.799
 very difficult I'm sure then there this 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.510
 then you will not need to 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.920
 copy the neighbor's question 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.420
 neighbor's answer forgiveness like you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.799

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:40.299
 some who are professionals of 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.739
 that and I really congratulate them on 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:43.180
 you for your fair play when I see 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.280
 answers that are copied but it's 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.870
 just epic and I'm just crazy 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.340
 literally from your mouth sometimes into 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.230
 seeing the number of people who 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.159
 can recopy the nonsense of others 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.659
 but hey, you have to know how to think 

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:54.010
 colander by itself and at the bottom end 

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:55.810
 those who know how to think for themselves 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.730
 are often rewarded 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.959

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.730
