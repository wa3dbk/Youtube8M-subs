long dogs have a short attention span
and<00:03:32.160> you're<00:03:33.160> going<00:03:33.460> to<00:03:33.490> work<00:03:33.910> in<00:03:34.150> several

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
and you're going to work in several

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:38.280

micro sessions within your total macro

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.640 
micro sessions within your total macro
session<00:03:38.740> so<00:03:39.220> every<00:03:40.090> time<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.630> we<00:03:40.960> quit<00:03:41.410> on

one<00:03:42.490> subject<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.450> dog<00:03:43.690> is<00:03:43.870> going<00:03:43.990> to

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
one subject that dog is going to

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.020 
one subject that dog is going to
remember<00:03:44.560> that<00:03:44.740> what<00:03:45.220> just<00:03:45.430> happened<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:45.940> that

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
remember that what just happened in that

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:48.840 
remember that what just happened in that
subject<00:03:46.360> so<00:03:47.140> if<00:03:47.290> we<00:03:47.470> switch<00:03:47.860> subjects<00:03:48.610> and

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
subject so if we switch subjects and

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:52.080 
subject so if we switch subjects and
each<00:03:49.780> time<00:03:50.080> we<00:03:50.260> switch<00:03:50.530> subjects<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.700> end<00:03:51.910> on<00:03:52.060> a

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
each time we switch subjects we end on a

each time we switch subjects we end on a
success<00:03:52.660> the<00:03:52.930> dog<00:03:53.140> is<00:03:53.320> going<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.560> remember<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
success the dog is going to remember the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:55.790 
success the dog is going to remember the
success<00:03:54.610> so<00:03:54.850> what<00:03:55.000> gives<00:03:55.180> us<00:03:55.330> an<00:03:55.480> opportunity

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
success so what gives us an opportunity

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.770 
success so what gives us an opportunity
to<00:03:56.800> do<00:03:57.010> a<00:03:57.220> lot<00:03:57.490> more<00:03:57.520> work<00:03:57.970> by<00:03:58.210> switching

00:03:58.770 --> 00:03:58.780 
to do a lot more work by switching

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.130 
to do a lot more work by switching
subjects<00:03:59.280> so<00:04:00.280> for<00:04:01.150> each<00:04:01.600> one<00:04:01.930> of<00:04:01.960> our

to do multi-sided heeling which we're

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.650 
to do multi-sided heeling which we're
going<00:04:36.190> to<00:04:36.250> do<00:04:36.400> with<00:04:36.550> DT<00:04:36.910> in<00:04:37.120> other<00:04:37.240> words<00:04:37.480> he's

eventually going to he on either side of
us<00:04:40.000> we'll<00:04:40.750> switch<00:04:41.020> sides<00:04:41.460> good<00:04:42.900> good<00:04:43.900> good

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650

what we want

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.570 
what we want
to<00:04:49.690> do<00:04:49.900> so<00:04:50.440> we're<00:04:50.620> saying<00:04:50.890> the<00:04:51.040> command<00:04:51.430> to

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:51.580 
to do so we're saying the command to

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.940 
to do so we're saying the command to
build<00:04:51.760> that<00:04:51.910> association<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:53.170> technique<00:04:53.740> by

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
build that association this technique by

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.560 
build that association this technique by
the<00:04:54.010> way<00:04:54.220> of<00:04:54.340> using<00:04:54.700> treats<00:04:54.970> to<00:04:55.150> get<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.390> dog

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
the way of using treats to get the dog

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.200 
the way of using treats to get the dog
to<00:04:55.600> learn<00:04:56.080> a<00:04:56.110> procedure<00:04:56.650> is<00:04:56.920> called<00:04:57.490> luring

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
to learn a procedure is called luring

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.900 
to learn a procedure is called luring
we're<00:04:58.780> luring<00:04:59.200> him<00:04:59.560> in<00:04:59.830> to<00:05:00.160> doing<00:05:00.430> things<00:05:00.640> and

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:00.910 
we're luring him in to doing things and

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:02.670 
we're luring him in to doing things and
at<00:05:01.480> the<00:05:01.600> same<00:05:01.840> time<00:05:02.140> we're<00:05:02.320> getting<00:05:02.410> him<00:05:02.650> used

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:02.680 
at the same time we're getting him used

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.080 
at the same time we're getting him used
to<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.130> feel<00:05:03.430> of<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.730> negative

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:04.090
