 everywhere before putting the meat 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.880
 since it's okay a puppy we put him 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.820
 the meat 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.640

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:37.190
 pepper and salt me ​​instead of salt 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:39.530
 I'm using this meat tenderizer 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.610
 Meat tenderizer comes with salt and 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.350
 onion 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.350
 it is the same as you put salt 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.270
 I am using a thin cut 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.580
 like centimeter centimeter and a half we go 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.420
 to get our powder right 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.590
 Meat tenderizer and pepper 

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.089

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.420
 mccormick meat tenderizer 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.780
 we are going to put pepper on it and I use the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.549
 bar brand I liked it a lot because you 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.450
 get freshly ground pepper and do not 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.670
 the one that is recessed with wood 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.619
 we are going to put on both sides a 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.320
 once we have covered the part of 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.130
 above we turn it over and put it to 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.270
 the bottom part its foundation and its salt and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.270
 we will let it rest 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.430
 roll of thin bag to wrap 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.260
 I do not know what it's called but it's what 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.330
 we put and we take it to the reflector two 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.850
 hours as I told you, you have to 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.860
 make the most of the time and to me 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.990
 like to take advantage of time those two 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:54.560
 hours that the meat can be bought in the 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.560
 I'll use it to play the play 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.040
 sing play I love to play I love 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.100
 play I'm a Mongolian when I get to 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.290
 to play 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.509
 that is in the place that for the love that 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.680
 profess say that not everything already tells me that 

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.680
 Yes thanks 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.340
 It's been two hours since we left the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.890
 marinated meat on it replied in this 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.459
 point should already be well and soft 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:03.980
 seasoned let's heat our comal 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.689
 our grill our skillet what 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.299
 you use the people who do 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:10.909
 like with olive oil is 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:13.400
 important that you olive oil 

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.400
 extra virgin because that's what the 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.260
 flavor is not the same as using a 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.870
 common oil part using the oil 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.720
 olive 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.019
 since it is very hot we put the 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:29.819
 piece of meat important data to the 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:32.310
 cuts are only given one turn 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:35.459
 let's also make sautéed potatoes 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.590
 the skills easy to prepare only 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:39.540
 we will use in this case you to 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.879
 the two potatoes because they are two cuts not 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.040
 is that I'm doing and so a pope 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.490
 for everyone already know the starch for 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.150
 that we want good for guys 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:51.740
 and as he told them, they only give him one 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:53.540
 return to the meat do not get to give 

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.990
 lap after lap after lap because 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:59.080
 they will have a chewing gum of meat 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.730
 for the potato we are going to use 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:05.000
 butter margarine or what you 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:08.390
 Like and seasoning condiments too 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.460
 go to me I like a lot we go to 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.570
 undo the butter in the pan 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.750
 very hot and we are going to throw the 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.390
 potatoes 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.130
 another thing that I did not tell you once 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.860
 had commented during the course of 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.350
 video the meat is preferably topped 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:30.260
 put a lid and it's going to leave between 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.380
 four or five minutes to make it 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.140
 well cooked 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:37.050
 45 minutes like the potatoes 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.480
 we are going to put pepper and 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.780
 let's put the seasoning not me 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.220
 agreement what it's called is something like it is 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.700
 several but I do not remember what that 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:49.170
 nador of meats but he did not remember that 

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.830
 I will find out very well other videos in the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.520
 comments 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:55.910
 we are going to add you 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:58.430
 since this seasoning gives it a lot of flavor 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:59.360
 no salt is not going to take anything from 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.180
 salt no idea 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:04.039
 culminated the pepper is for diaz the 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.550
 seasoning that was telling them that 

00:05:04.039 --> 00:05:10.159
 I do not remember the name is also badia and 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:12.139
 we are going to cover it, we are going to mix it very 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.539
 well since the butter is well 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.889
 melted is at medium heat do not go to 

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.139
 make on high heat because they are going to 

00:05:15.889 --> 00:05:23.750
 burn the potatoes and it is going to leave covered 

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:26.599
 approximately 10 minutes when 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:29.479
 you prick it with a fork or with 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.940
 a toothpick and pass easily 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:33.860
 it's because the potato is already ready as well as 

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:36.409
 it can be dad can you put any 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.330
 another vegetable that you like in this 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:42.250
 I 'm just going to put potatoes because 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.250
 I only have dad, I'm poor 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.060
 as a complement we can also 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.629
 use take I cut it into julienne and 

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:56.539
 the marine with a little bit of lemon and salt 

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:59.050
 well minced and arrives at the time of 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:05:59.050
 to serve 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.120
 let's grab a big plate because 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:06.310
 a small plate is going to look like a 

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.350
 piles up the meals and we're going to 

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:13.230
 put a bed of lettuce to the meat 

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:15.440
 I use milk orejón a region 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:15.440
 A) Yes 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.940
 we put the meat on top of the bed 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:23.940
 lettuce the tomatitos 

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:26.430
 and another thing that is to do is apperceived 

00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:29.340
 in the video is to show them how to do the 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:32.370
 onion the onion nothing else is going to 

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:36.120
 cut and it's going to be put in it 

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:40.670
 oil where the meat is cold nothing more 

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:43.530
 we are going to put in the same planchita 

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:46.200
 since once transparent is already 

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:48.370
 list takes nothing but pure juice 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:50.500
 who let go of the meat 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.380
 this is the little onion that said 

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:55.510
 Delicious does not have the taste of onion 

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:58.180
 that highlights the tears in your eyes 

00:06:55.510 --> 00:07:00.550
 and the potatoes thus left the potatoes as 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:03.570
 you can see they are very warm and this 

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.570
 It is our plate 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.660
 this has been all for today 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:12.670
 I hope you liked it very much 

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:14.290

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.240

00:07:14.290 --> 00:07:18.310
