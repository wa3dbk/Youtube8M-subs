00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
going to be based on my back like I

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.540 
going to be based on my back like I
showed<00:00:27.930> you<00:00:27.990> what<00:00:28.230> when<00:00:28.380> you<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:28.590> the<00:00:28.740> wall<00:00:28.950> so

I<00:00:29.580> have<00:00:29.760> to<00:00:29.910> figure<00:00:30.060> out<00:00:30.240> that<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:31.080> distance

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
I have to figure out that the distance

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.560 
I have to figure out that the distance
so<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.219> could<00:00:32.279> do<00:00:32.550> enjoy<00:00:32.789> cutting<00:00:33.149> board
