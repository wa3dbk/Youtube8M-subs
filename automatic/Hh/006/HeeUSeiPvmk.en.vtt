00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.630 
bags also but I thought this would be
interesting<00:03:15.440> to<00:03:15.470> show<00:03:18.190> possibly<00:03:19.190> even<00:03:19.340> use

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:19.640 
interesting to show possibly even use

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.680 
interesting to show possibly even use
for<00:03:19.910> micro<00:03:20.480> laminating<00:03:22.090> for<00:03:23.090> doing<00:03:23.329> a<00:03:23.450> little

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690 
for micro laminating for doing a little

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.539 
for micro laminating for doing a little
laminating<00:03:24.380> project<00:03:25.840> so<00:03:26.840> this<00:03:27.130> this<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.370> my
