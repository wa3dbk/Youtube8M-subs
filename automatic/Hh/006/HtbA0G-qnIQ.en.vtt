00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.719
 knife hello dear it is water 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:15.380
 I want to share with you how to make a cage 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.380
 from the pallet to the details 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.380
 mean to this cell 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:31.679
 8 pallets are consumed 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:35.610
 well, you can, and 7 cost of the cell is 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.870
 the cost of the pallet because it goes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:45.140
 all the nails herself longing 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:50.190
 mean in order floor 2 pallets 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:55.550
 sewed on the narrow side of the pallet 1 meter 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.379
 20 on 80 and it turns out the cell width 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:07.439
 meter sixty and a meter deep twenty 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.890
 helluva lot goes for solid rigidity 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:11.070
 melancholy 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:19.460
 Of course , you can take a board from pallets 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:22.799
 and then make a break heap 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.040
 the overlap of the board with a pallet 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.040
 way 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.720
 the side walls are also solid pallet 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:41.850
 but since pallets board goes astray 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:48.050
 since well, not solid, so I dismissed 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:51.090
 melancholy pallet and scored these slits 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.900
 accordingly did the same with 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.300
 side wall means here it turns out 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:04.350
 the side wall here is the pallet here it is here 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:08.330
 pallet height 60 centimeters means 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:12.180
 here another 20 centimeters for water flow 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:14.850
 here is that clean pallet here 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:20.550
 stuffed February 2, respectively, there is a board 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:22.080
 cut in the cage the only thing 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:27.860
 used additionally 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:31.730
 this is the bottom board which is wired and 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:35.209
 bar top bar 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.940
 side bars for doors 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:44.540
 accordingly here you can take 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:49.970
 also a simple board here and here 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:54.360
 mean middle wall inner wall 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:00.959
 it is a collapsible pan that is clean 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:04.890
 melancholy that goes on stitching up I 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:07.950
 put an extra bar in order 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.320
 so as you can make sure that the board 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.610
 Well, better fastened to the narrow will 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.420
 attach much worse 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.560
 from two sides therefore 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:22.739
 if you put the second board 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:26.250
 Now let's say that you can 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:34.730
 make sure that the mount will be 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:38.849
 much more comfortable inside I put inside 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:42.650
 grid bar to lift the grid 

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.239
 to raise the feeder up 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.819
 means that the feeder does not lie on the floor 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:53.670
 stood on this inner bar 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:04:02.190
 Now I will show you exactly how it is. 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:09.680
 looks like with the feeder here is the cage 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:14.370
 the inhabitants here are the feeder is simple 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:15.060
 containers mean in order not to 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:22.560
 gnawed 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:27.960
 you can use this here 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:31.229
 metal thing this is the second 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:38.099
 lodgers means this is a drinking bowl 

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:41.400
 the same right to not go I 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:45.650
 I'll show you the roof will be on stereo on 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:51.419
 like a ruberoid and like this 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:53.669
 actually here is an influx here is an influx for 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:58.800
 so that the water flows and there will be 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:05:04.500
 the top is also covered with roofing door 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:07.199
 made of solid boards also finish saying 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.750
 the daughter of this board i mean i mean that 

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:11.500
 you can put their doors do of the grid 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.310
 but 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.630
 I specifically made wood for 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:27.840
 so that it will be warmer here in winter 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:32.320
 With regards to internal means feeders 

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:35.710
 here, too, the board starts up, but since 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:39.040
 this distance is more than 140 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.740
 millimeters on the bottom board something 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:48.820
 goes on error 2 boards and here it is 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:52.919
 actually sodding together here it is 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:58.150
 stuffed up like that 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:59.700
 did metal it left me 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:04.450
 from construction 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:11.050
 I straightened it and closed all parts 

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:13.750
 internal here right here so that you 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:21.000
 just not nibbled and accordingly I 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:26.520
 it turns out no where they will not bite 

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:28.830
 so what else is this board to 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:32.560
 proper not to prop up 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:33.160
 grid and so it will stand or where no 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.010
 going away 

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:39.940
 but in order that well, you never know krol 

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:42.220
 will jump over so when here it is 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:48.910
 it will be like this looking for the top then he 

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:50.530
 just can not get it all here again 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:57.070
 go around on all sides 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:07:00.190
 look it turns out an interesting cell 

00:06:57.070 --> 00:07:01.780
 which cost actually 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:07.870
 I got pallets for free 

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:11.100
 and therefore the cost of this cell well in 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.100
 principle only on the grid 

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.080
 all bye
