they<00:02:08.509> may<00:02:08.690> argue<00:02:09.080> there<00:02:09.320> are<00:02:09.380> two<00:02:09.530> completely

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140 
different clubs right now and you can

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.270 
different clubs right now and you can
see<00:02:12.349> that<00:02:12.379> when<00:02:12.709> you<00:02:12.800> look<00:02:13.010> at<00:02:13.129> their

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
see that when you look at their

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.030 
see that when you look at their
head-to-head<00:02:13.730> in<00:02:13.900> 2014

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040

that's<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.120> little<00:02:19.269> bit<00:02:19.359> surprising<00:02:19.750> based<00:02:20.170> on

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
that's a little bit surprising based on

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:21.630 
that's a little bit surprising based on
where<00:02:20.500> they<00:02:20.620> ended<00:02:20.799> up<00:02:20.890> in<00:02:21.040> the<00:02:21.129> standing<00:02:21.519> yeah

two matchups two wins I don't think
anybody<00:02:24.790> out<00:02:25.180> there<00:02:25.359> wasn't<00:02:25.780> paying

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
anybody out there wasn't paying

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.599 
anybody out there wasn't paying
attention<00:02:26.049> would<00:02:26.469> have<00:02:26.590> guessed<00:02:26.799> that<00:02:27.069> one

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:27.609 
attention would have guessed that one

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:28.949
