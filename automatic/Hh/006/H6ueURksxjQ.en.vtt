00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:37.170
 Foxes a little more than one kilogram 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.860
 the second is the presence of yellow duralumin labs 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.790
 and not 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:44.010
 which means solved the problem of packing a backpack 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.370
 for beginners and third 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.780

 chest screed 0 on to can it be

 all is not the softest straps are not the most 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.869
 wide but for its scope for those 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:16.470
 weights on which it is calculated quite 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.780
 enough now and me personally 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 I would like to have counter-reclining 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.790
 trails on backpack straps and not one but two 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.299
 utyazhki or even 3 on the side parts 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.369
 backpack these utyazhki allowed will 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.840
 mount length gauges such as 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.040

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.090
 ski poles 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:45.210
 on the sides of the backpack now 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.520
 the only way to fix the foam 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.079
 plastic travel mat 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.640
