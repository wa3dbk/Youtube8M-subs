00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.430 
that's what I call the mid-tone value

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:26.070 
that's what I call the mid-tone value
there's<00:00:24.640> a<00:00:24.730> lot<00:00:24.940> of<00:00:25.119> that<00:00:25.330> at<00:00:25.480> any<00:00:25.630> particular

mid-tone on this piece of illustration
board<00:00:47.760> previously<00:00:48.760> took<00:00:48.940> about<00:00:49.149> ten<00:00:49.420> minutes

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
board previously took about ten minutes

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:53.160 
board previously took about ten minutes
to<00:00:49.839> dry<00:00:50.170> and<00:00:50.489> then<00:00:51.489> transfer<00:00:52.179> to<00:00:52.209> line<00:00:52.600> drawing

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.170 
to dry and then transfer to line drawing

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.989 
to dry and then transfer to line drawing
and<00:00:54.299> using<00:00:55.299> chalk<00:00:55.749> and<00:00:56.260> my<00:00:56.889> grid<00:00:57.639> drawing

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:57.999 
and using chalk and my grid drawing

00:00:57.999 --> 00:01:00.959 
and using chalk and my grid drawing
method<00:00:58.539> so<00:00:58.780> after<00:00:59.109> I<00:00:59.170> transferred<00:00:59.859> that<00:01:00.159> then

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
method so after I transferred that then

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.080 
method so after I transferred that then
I<00:01:01.059> put<00:01:01.269> the<00:01:01.389> line<00:01:01.600> drawing<00:01:01.899> paper<00:01:02.170> away<00:01:02.559> and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
I put the line drawing paper away and

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.620 
I put the line drawing paper away and
started<00:01:04.090> with<00:01:04.690> black<00:01:05.620> acrylic<00:01:06.520> paint<00:01:06.790> I've

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:07.630 
started with black acrylic paint I've

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.600 
started with black acrylic paint I've
got<00:01:07.900> the<00:01:08.200> black<00:01:08.500> and<00:01:08.530> white<00:01:08.830> only<00:01:09.070> on<00:01:09.400> my

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:09.610 
got the black and white only on my

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.190 
got the black and white only on my
palette<00:01:10.120> that<00:01:10.270> you<00:01:10.330> see<00:01:10.600> there<00:01:10.780> on<00:01:10.870> the<00:01:10.930> right

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
palette that you see there on the right

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.620 
palette that you see there on the right
and<00:01:12.100> I'm<00:01:12.400> starting<00:01:12.760> this<00:01:13.090> with<00:01:13.480> the<00:01:13.870> shadows

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and I'm starting this with the shadows

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.240 
and I'm starting this with the shadows
now<00:01:16.630> in<00:01:16.900> my<00:01:17.140> teaching<00:01:17.530> career<00:01:17.710> I've<00:01:17.980> talked

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
now in my teaching career I've talked

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.940 
now in my teaching career I've talked
quite<00:01:18.640> a<00:01:18.670> bit<00:01:18.790> about<00:01:19.530> thinking<00:01:20.530> of<00:01:20.770> your

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:20.950 
quite a bit about thinking of your

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.310 
quite a bit about thinking of your
paintings<00:01:21.370> and<00:01:21.550> three<00:01:21.880> values<00:01:22.480> remember

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:23.320 
paintings and three values remember

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.300 
paintings and three values remember
values<00:01:24.010> are<00:01:24.310> the<00:01:25.180> tone<00:01:25.450> of<00:01:25.480> the<00:01:26.230> tone<00:01:26.530> from

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
values are the tone of the tone from

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.510 
values are the tone of the tone from
light<00:01:27.760> to<00:01:28.150> dark<00:01:28.570> and<00:01:28.930> so<00:01:29.830> when<00:01:29.950> I<00:01:30.010> say<00:01:30.190> a<00:01:30.220> value

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:30.520 
light to dark and so when I say a value

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.820 
light to dark and so when I say a value
a<00:01:30.790> high<00:01:31.060> value<00:01:31.540> would<00:01:31.660> be<00:01:31.720> close<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.230> white<00:01:32.470> a

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
a high value would be close to white a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.000 
a high value would be close to white a
low<00:01:33.370> value<00:01:33.610> would<00:01:34.030> be<00:01:34.090> close<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.480> black<00:01:34.980> or<00:01:35.980> the

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
low value would be close to black or the

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:39.420 
low value would be close to black or the
absence<00:01:36.550> of<00:01:36.640> color<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.960> if<00:01:38.230> you<00:01:38.260> narrow<00:01:39.190> this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
absence of color so if you narrow this

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.710 
absence of color so if you narrow this
down<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.720> think<00:01:41.200> in<00:01:41.380> terms<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:42.420> three<00:01:43.420> values

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:43.720 
down and think in terms of three values

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:46.890 
down and think in terms of three values
that<00:01:44.440> you<00:01:44.680> you<00:01:45.460> know<00:01:45.520> work<00:01:45.760> in<00:01:46.060> it'll<00:01:46.450> help<00:01:46.630> you

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
that you you know work in it'll help you

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.710 
that you you know work in it'll help you
see<00:01:47.320> what<00:01:47.650> what<00:01:48.310> you<00:01:48.430> need<00:01:48.580> to<00:01:48.700> do<00:01:48.850> and<00:01:49.570> your

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
see what what you need to do and your

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.470 
see what what you need to do and your
intuition<00:01:50.050> can<00:01:50.530> guide<00:01:50.740> the<00:01:50.920> way<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.270> while

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
intuition can guide the way so while

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.970 
intuition can guide the way so while
I've<00:01:52.540> been<00:01:52.600> talking<00:01:52.750> I<00:01:53.290> laid<00:01:53.470> in<00:01:53.620> all<00:01:53.770> the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
I've been talking I laid in all the

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:57.510 
I've been talking I laid in all the
shadow<00:01:54.280> tones<00:01:54.670> and<00:01:55.560> started<00:01:56.560> with<00:01:56.740> that<00:01:57.010> it's

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
shadow tones and started with that it's

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.240 
shadow tones and started with that it's
a<00:01:57.580> good<00:01:57.760> a<00:01:57.970> good<00:01:58.210> way<00:01:58.390> to<00:01:58.450> start<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:59.220> then<00:02:00.220> the

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
a good a good way to start and then the

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.780 
a good a good way to start and then the
second<00:02:00.970> area<00:02:01.420> you'll<00:02:01.840> see<00:02:01.900> that<00:02:02.400> darker<00:02:03.400> gray

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:03.790 
second area you'll see that darker gray

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.480 
second area you'll see that darker gray
so<00:02:04.780> if<00:02:04.930> the<00:02:05.080> background<00:02:05.500> mid-tone<00:02:06.070> that

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
so if the background mid-tone that

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.350 
so if the background mid-tone that
darker<00:02:06.970> gray<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:08.409> can<00:02:08.439> refer<00:02:08.950> to<00:02:08.979> as<00:02:09.429> as<00:02:09.639> a

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
darker gray you can refer to as as a

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.950 
darker gray you can refer to as as a
F<00:02:10.450> tone<00:02:11.370> excuse<00:02:12.370> me<00:02:12.550> it's<00:02:13.450> about<00:02:13.630> halfway

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
F tone excuse me it's about halfway

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.360 
F tone excuse me it's about halfway
between<00:02:14.410> your<00:02:14.770> mid-tone<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:17.110> your<00:02:17.350> shadow<00:02:17.620> so

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.490 
between your mid-tone and your shadow so
I<00:02:18.430> laid<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.670> little<00:02:18.970> bit<00:02:19.090> of<00:02:19.210> that<00:02:19.390> in<00:02:19.660> and<00:02:19.960> then

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500 
I laid a little bit of that in and then

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.500 
I laid a little bit of that in and then
now<00:02:20.710> finally<00:02:21.070> I'm<00:02:21.550> working<00:02:22.090> on<00:02:22.240> the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
now finally I'm working on the

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.230 
now finally I'm working on the
highlights<00:02:23.050> now<00:02:23.310> highlights<00:02:24.310> are<00:02:24.550> really<00:02:25.090> the

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
highlights now highlights are really the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.500 
highlights now highlights are really the
fun<00:02:25.510> part<00:02:25.900> of<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.920> painting<00:02:27.550> process<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
fun part of the painting process and

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.930 
fun part of the painting process and
you'll<00:02:29.260> notice<00:02:29.500> that<00:02:29.800> most<00:02:30.100> of<00:02:30.370> the<00:02:30.490> work<00:02:30.700> is

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
you'll notice that most of the work is

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.340 
you'll notice that most of the work is
in<00:02:31.590> manipulating<00:02:32.590> the<00:02:33.580> highlights<00:02:34.060> of<00:02:34.450> this

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
in manipulating the highlights of this

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.990 
in manipulating the highlights of this
work<00:02:35.710> they<00:02:36.160> seem<00:02:36.490> to<00:02:36.790> bring<00:02:37.170> shape<00:02:38.170> and<00:02:38.470> form

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
work they seem to bring shape and form

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.070 
work they seem to bring shape and form
to<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:41.200> flat<00:02:42.040> two-dimensional<00:02:42.550> or<00:02:43.120> 2d<00:02:43.570> surface

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:44.080 
to a flat two-dimensional or 2d surface

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:45.990 
to a flat two-dimensional or 2d surface
so<00:02:44.830> we<00:02:44.950> want<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.310> illusion<00:02:45.580> of

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
so we want the illusion of

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.990 
so we want the illusion of
three-dimensional<00:02:46.390> 3d<00:02:47.200> and<00:02:47.520> so<00:02:48.520> your

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
three-dimensional 3d and so your

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000 
three-dimensional 3d and so your
highlight<00:02:49.420> especially<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.200> will<00:02:50.350> will<00:02:50.739> bring

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
highlight especially it will will bring

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.060 
highlight especially it will will bring
that<00:02:51.190> out<00:02:51.630> now<00:02:52.630> I<00:02:52.690> didn't<00:02:52.989> work<00:02:53.170> very<00:02:53.440> long<00:02:53.680> on

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
that out now I didn't work very long on

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.020 
that out now I didn't work very long on
the<00:02:54.370> shadows<00:02:54.850> and<00:02:55.270> and<00:02:55.920> half-tones<00:02:57.000> before<00:02:58.000> I

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
the shadows and and half-tones before I

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:00.390 
the shadows and and half-tones before I
jumped<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.540> to<00:02:58.690> highlight<00:02:59.080> that<00:02:59.709> could<00:02:59.980> be<00:03:00.160> one

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
jumped in to highlight that could be one

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.590 
jumped in to highlight that could be one
problem<00:03:00.640> actually<00:03:01.290> but<00:03:02.290> when<00:03:02.470> when<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.600> when

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
problem actually but when when you when

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.880 
problem actually but when when you when
you're<00:03:04.750> painting<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.350> want<00:03:05.560> to<00:03:05.650> try<00:03:05.830> to

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
you're painting you want to try to

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.130 
you're painting you want to try to
resist<00:03:06.310> the<00:03:06.489> urge<00:03:06.520> to<00:03:06.790> lay<00:03:07.420> in<00:03:07.570> highlights<00:03:07.930> too

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
resist the urge to lay in highlights too

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:10.340 
resist the urge to lay in highlights too
quickly<00:03:08.440> because<00:03:09.160> they<00:03:09.310> should<00:03:09.520> sit<00:03:09.820> on<00:03:09.850> top

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:10.350 
quickly because they should sit on top

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:13.949 
quickly because they should sit on top
now<00:03:11.350> you<00:03:11.380> notice<00:03:11.739> here<00:03:12.100> that<00:03:12.130> I'm<00:03:12.690> laying<00:03:13.690> in

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
now you notice here that I'm laying in

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.220 
now you notice here that I'm laying in
the<00:03:14.830> white<00:03:15.340> background<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.360> I'm<00:03:16.450> I'm<00:03:16.959> leaving

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
the white background and I'm I'm leaving

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.460 
the white background and I'm I'm leaving
some<00:03:17.560> strokes<00:03:17.920> in<00:03:18.160> there<00:03:18.400> I<00:03:18.610> like<00:03:19.269> to<00:03:20.230> show

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
some strokes in there I like to show

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.949 
some strokes in there I like to show
that<00:03:20.830> the<00:03:21.010> painter<00:03:21.340> was<00:03:21.489> there<00:03:21.760> if<00:03:22.120> you<00:03:22.690> paint

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:22.959 
that the painter was there if you paint

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.390 
that the painter was there if you paint
things<00:03:23.290> so<00:03:23.620> completely<00:03:24.630> realistic<00:03:25.630> in<00:03:26.410> some

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
things so completely realistic in some

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.420 
things so completely realistic in some
ways<00:03:27.640> you<00:03:27.850> lose<00:03:28.150> a<00:03:28.180> value<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:29.130> found<00:03:30.130> that<00:03:30.250> art

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:30.430 
ways you lose a value I found that art

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.729 
ways you lose a value I found that art
directors<00:03:30.940> want<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.480> see<00:03:31.750> that<00:03:32.440> it's<00:03:32.620> a

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
directors want to see that it's a

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:35.550 
directors want to see that it's a
painting<00:03:33.220> not<00:03:33.430> a<00:03:33.489> photograph<00:03:34.120> it<00:03:34.780> is<00:03:34.930> possible

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
painting not a photograph it is possible

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.880 
painting not a photograph it is possible
to<00:03:35.590> paint<00:03:35.980> it's<00:03:36.370> so<00:03:36.780> tight<00:03:37.780> and<00:03:38.170> rendered<00:03:38.680> out

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
to paint it's so tight and rendered out

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.680 
to paint it's so tight and rendered out
that<00:03:39.489> people<00:03:39.790> will<00:03:39.940> mistake<00:03:40.060> it<00:03:40.480> for

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
that people will mistake it for

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.600 
that people will mistake it for
photographs<00:03:41.200> and<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.950> don't<00:03:42.100> really<00:03:42.280> want

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 
photographs and you don't really want

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.970 
photographs and you don't really want
that<00:03:42.910> if<00:03:43.180> we<00:03:43.690> want<00:03:43.930> to<00:03:44.019> photograph<00:03:44.200> we<00:03:44.709> shoot<00:03:44.950> a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
that if we want to photograph we shoot a

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.000 
that if we want to photograph we shoot a
picture<00:03:45.190> of<00:03:45.519> it<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.790> then<00:03:46.560> have<00:03:47.560> it<00:03:47.590> done<00:03:47.830> at

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
picture of it and then have it done at

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.590 
picture of it and then have it done at
that<00:03:48.130> point<00:03:48.299> with<00:03:49.299> painters<00:03:50.019> today<00:03:50.200> or<00:03:50.739> hired

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
that point with painters today or hired

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.900 
that point with painters today or hired
because<00:03:52.600> the<00:03:53.530> artist<00:03:53.950> and<00:03:54.130> the<00:03:54.220> craftsmanship

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
because the artist and the craftsmanship

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.960 
because the artist and the craftsmanship
the<00:03:55.480> magic<00:03:55.959> is<00:03:56.140> still<00:03:56.350> showing<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:57.700> be<00:03:57.940> sure

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
the magic is still showing so be sure

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.690 
the magic is still showing so be sure
don't<00:03:58.570> don't<00:03:59.170> render<00:04:00.040> out<00:04:00.190> every<00:04:00.580> little

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
don't don't render out every little

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.660 
don't don't render out every little

thing on your work allow those strokes

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.180 
thing on your work allow those strokes
to<00:04:03.970> show<00:04:04.239> and<00:04:04.510> allow<00:04:04.690> some<00:04:05.080> of<00:04:05.110> the<00:04:05.830> artists

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190

hand to pop through your your painting

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:13.800 
hand to pop through your your painting
communication<00:04:11.880> well<00:04:12.880> we're<00:04:13.030> getting<00:04:13.150> on

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
communication well we're getting on

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:15.870 
communication well we're getting on
toward<00:04:14.260> the<00:04:14.320> end<00:04:14.620> and<00:04:14.739> you'll<00:04:14.890> notice<00:04:15.250> the

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
toward the end and you'll notice the

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.870 
toward the end and you'll notice the
last<00:04:16.060> few<00:04:16.359> steps<00:04:16.419> here<00:04:17.049> I'm<00:04:17.590> doing<00:04:17.950> a<00:04:18.250> blending

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
last few steps here I'm doing a blending

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.510 
last few steps here I'm doing a blending
between<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.419> shadow<00:04:19.780> and<00:04:20.169> the<00:04:20.229> mid-tone<00:04:20.709> so

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
between the shadow and the mid-tone so

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.040 
between the shadow and the mid-tone so
you<00:04:21.669> call<00:04:21.880> it<00:04:21.970> you<00:04:22.090> could<00:04:22.240> call<00:04:22.390> that<00:04:22.419> halftone

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
you call it you could call that halftone

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.390 
you call it you could call that halftone
but<00:04:23.289> those<00:04:23.440> transitional

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:24.400 
but those transitional

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.830 
but those transitional
are<00:04:24.729> very<00:04:24.970> important<00:04:25.570> to<00:04:26.380> turn<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.340> shape<00:04:27.840> in

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
are very important to turn the shape in

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.230 
are very important to turn the shape in
space<00:04:29.259> so<00:04:30.040> if<00:04:30.160> you've<00:04:30.310> got<00:04:30.430> a<00:04:30.490> black<00:04:30.880> up

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
space so if you've got a black up
