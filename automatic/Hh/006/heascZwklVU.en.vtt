00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:10.259
 hello friends friends good today I'm going to 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.259
 talk I do not know what it is 

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.470
 good to me it does not cost me to be serious but 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.900
 lately I'm serious because if I 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.300
 get caught let's say things and I do not know what 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.210
 do good today I'm going to talk a little bit 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.179
 of the handles that have some 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.150
 let's say famous dance artists 

00:00:28.179 --> 00:00:33.220
 oriental good the day I'm going to give the 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.590
 good names are going to fall in the world 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.420
 whole it seems that it is something else but 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.790
 they have a mania it seems as if we're going to 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.010
 bring the madonna or we are going to bring these 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:45.490
 stars so big children for god 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:47.500
 let's have some license and if a 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.150
 that organizes apart from organizes that 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.770
 you have to promote that you have to 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:54.010
 bring the people that have that 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.510
 Claven the artist come for the artist 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.580
 but he also did a job of the 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.140
 organizer and then there's also that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:00.200
 have a little respect for these 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.990
 people 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.760
 that we organize and do things but 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.130
 start at the efficient for example one 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.620
 that comes abengoa mayor to wash already of 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.110
 vacation I'm going to bring my manager and he left 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.540
 by god how are you going to bring manager a 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:17.000
 little bit of license like I'm going to pay you 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.729
 here they pay camera and it pays me well seen 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.729
 then here I want to give water water 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.770
 it has to be of this thing the work no no 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.930
 all the famous ones are so it's another 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.750
 thing I'm not talking now in total 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.729
 but there are some and they continue and that's why 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:34.910
 let's say no one told us because because of me 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.940
 happened to me that can not be must have 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.210
 a little humility because this world 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.570
 what is it is so small that there is not 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.820
 many people let's say we 're going to see 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.009
 the oriental dance not as if it were for 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.990
 example we say another neighborhood for example 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:53.630
 the ballet or something like that has more 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 followers the oriental dance and they are 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.280
 let's say a guild a little smaller and 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.740
 more here in Balearics here in variables 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.790
 it's very few people let's say there's no 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.880
 so much 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:07.070
 of having a lot of people and a course and 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.380
 then and we are going to keep fighting with 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.510
 what we want and we bring people to 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.400
 to be able to enjoy but what you do not know 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.980
 maybe they get bitter and that you get 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.540
 the tie is around here a bit for god 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.300
 you can not you can not 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.230
 that's not why we have to be humble and 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:26.690
 we have to be respectful and we have 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.390
 to respect the work of one and the other 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:31.970
 because I for example of the siege that 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.730
 organized my nobody lucas let's say you can 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:39.950
 to say that I mistreated him say no 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:43.849
 They put him much that 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.580
 the bad one I do not bring it to all rag well 

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.709
 attended and everything but and of course and has 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.160
 to be that mutual let's say the 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:55.430
 relationship is not given or anything but thanks to 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:57.680
 God, not all are equal, that's why 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.920
 have to give a lot of applause to those 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.800
 so professional professionals and 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.410
 so good that they live in normal and 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.120
 current that I appreciate it as the 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:12.080
 what am I going to bring now that is anna 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:15.230
 borissova that love is a line is a 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:18.110
 sky a sky for that and apart from a 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.610
 great professional good there is a movement 

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:21.739
 what I'm going to give is a movement that 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.680
 we also have in polygraphy 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:27.829
 you remember that I said claws two the 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.980
 sheets you remember one is left and the two 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:33.560
 and the three below but this is not this 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.180
 down I will teach what is the 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.599
 movement 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:41.840
 is to raise the hip and then lower 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:44.420
 heel and lower hip at the same time is 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.780
 elevate hip and lower heel and for 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.450
 hip at the same time and also low 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.299
 raise and lower I'll do it from the back 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.760
 so you see then he raised such where 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:59.920
 He sent hip and carl the heel and here 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.920
 hip with a punch is down 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:14.020
 then that movement is is one and 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:25.250
 afterwards I already kneed 1 2 

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:29.750
 11 21 12 12 12 that are 21 is to fall into the 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.620
 hip and 26 on the knee and knee 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:38.480
 for us to make a knee ornament 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:40.550
 a knee day 1 knee knee I do not know 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:43.669
 if I will do it that way so that 

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:47.270
 you can see walking towards irÃ¡n taking 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:50.870
 the right and the right knee do 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.470
 one and make them and left and the 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:57.620
 left knee according to 2 right 12 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.800
 the left points right 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:06.070
 2 left 12 and then when I 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.070
 we dance is a here 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:16.569
 we do it 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:22.839
 and we see the heels you can walk by 

00:05:16.569 --> 00:05:25.360
 it's a very, very nice movement 

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:27.849
 in this way this movement also 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.269
 is used when there are a few strokes if 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:33.699
 we do so backwards let's say no 

00:05:31.269 --> 00:05:36.479
 do it with shimmy but it also 

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:41.709
 uses all the strokes we use it 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:43.569
