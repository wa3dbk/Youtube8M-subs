that has the 360 degree or lock system

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.210 
that has the 360 degree or lock system
what<00:00:50.750> that<00:00:50.900> does<00:00:51.140> for<00:00:51.500> you<00:00:51.620> is<00:00:51.680> it<00:00:51.770> actually

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:54.680 
makes it easier and more efficient to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.130 
makes it easier and more efficient to
row<00:00:54.890> a<00:00:54.920> boat<00:00:55.280> this<00:00:55.520> size<00:00:55.820> you're<00:00:56.660> looking<00:00:57.020> to

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140

go long distances in your boat I would
definitely<00:00:59.989> look<00:01:00.170> for<00:01:00.470> a<00:01:00.500> boat<00:01:00.800> that<00:01:00.829> has<00:01:01.040> the

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 
definitely look for a boat that has the

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.770 
definitely look for a boat that has the

Mariner we've come to realize that the
