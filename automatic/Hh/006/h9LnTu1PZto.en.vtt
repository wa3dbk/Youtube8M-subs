00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.640
 head holds that could happen too 

00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:35.600
 that meteorites live 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.440
 That should be better if I have a day 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.220
 the first request 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.620
 which I got is priced like 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.090
 I'm doing a vegan tear and that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.629
 shows for you in this video 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:51.210
 first, it has a cup of rice in 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.579
 two cups of water with some salt so 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.040
 very small pinch of salt and head down 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.020
 All rich varieties are suitable for this purpose 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.480
 have him normal basmati rice 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.190
 taken important is the same with everyone 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.460
 far too if the bio rice varieties are 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.590
 Just the rice with cold water or 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.460
 even better still with hot water 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.700
 do the washing up 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.540
 that means five times six times with hot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.119
 Rinse water 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.180
 so you remove so so is unfortunately 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.979
 always included in rice in low 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.409
 and that's how you remove that 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.720
 Then I cooked the rice 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:27.869
 So a cup full of a large cup 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.440
 rice and you have a feeling with the 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.710
 rice water 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.460
 what still needs is a small one 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:38.580
 salt some agave syrup or agave 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.939
 sweet that may have scratched out a half 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.290
 minute and cold water and if you are 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:52.460
 of course you can do that 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:52.460
 baking powder even with small feel something 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:02:07.190
 Good teaspoon gets too much in the rice 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.190
 is already sweet like the homeland protection 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.960
 nevertheless water 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.640
 when he gets home with the earlier city 

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:25.829
 Just do it right for a long time 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.629
 seems to stir a bit longer 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:31.860
 as normal and after that if you have that 

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.530

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:43.220
 Replace turbid matter and settle 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.220
 and then it just happened 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:52.590
 So it just suits him 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.590
 pour liquid through a fine sieve 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.280

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:21.049
