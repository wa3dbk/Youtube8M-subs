because I do think this week we will

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:08.859 
because I do think this week we will
have<00:02:06.740> some<00:02:07.159> news<00:02:07.369> regarding<00:02:07.549> safe<00:02:08.179> testing<00:02:08.660> we

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
have some news regarding safe testing we

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.140 
have some news regarding safe testing we
have<00:02:09.050> seen<00:02:09.320> so<00:02:09.950> many<00:02:10.070> different<00:02:10.369> screen<00:02:10.880> shots

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.040 
we've seen a new tutorial where we've
actually<00:02:12.830> seen<00:02:13.280> gameplay<00:02:14.000> which<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.630> think<00:02:14.900> was

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
actually seen gameplay which I think was

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:17.320 
actually seen gameplay which I think was
the<00:02:15.110> finished<00:02:15.590> version<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:16.370> a<00:02:16.850> title<00:02:17.090> update
