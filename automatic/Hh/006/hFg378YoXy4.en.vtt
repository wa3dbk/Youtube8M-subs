00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:12.139
 hi girls then today the video that 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.519
 I promised the beach on the sunsets then 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.769
 I'll show you all the products that 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:17.630
 use when I expose the sun and vi 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.670
 in short, I tell you all the tricks 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.380
 which I adopt the stylizing creams 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.480
 these are for the body are these 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.670
 of the lancaster and this of the kick off 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.890
 both protection factor 50 that the 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.420
 production factor that I always use as 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.640
 many of you will already know the said 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.890
 dermatologist's advice while for 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.870
 the face I am using this of the d 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.940
 now also these under protection 50 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.070
 and on this I have to spend a couple of 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.290
 little words because normally great 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:44.480
 in the cream factor protection factor 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:47.840
 tall they are very mushy and hard to 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.490
 hang out and feel very heavy 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.800
 on the skin this I must say that 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.870
 phenomenal because it is very light 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.150
 absorbs immediately and does not really seem 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.980
 changed a protection factor like this 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.900
 high can also be used under the 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.760
 trick this is phenomenal then else 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.250
 product not to be forgotten and the stick 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.650
 I protect this kiko's lips 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.869
 also this protection 50 is when ve 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:10.759
 I showed him some videos in a video 

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:13.189
 in the comments they had written me that 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.500
 they found it useless to protect their lips and 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.299
 this thing is very wrong because the 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 lips just like the rest of the 

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.100
 our body of our body of ours 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.719
 body and our skin need 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.570
 of protection from the sun by uv rays 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.670
 howie b so even if it is on 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:30.560
 lips may not seem like it may seem that 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.079
 do not get burned I guarantee you that 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.880
 and the guarantors successes are also needed 

00:01:33.079 --> 00:01:37.009
 of the lip stick and I recommend i 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.179
 solar is very important to reapply it 

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.909
 several times during the day 

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.859
 so there is always written both behind and 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.149
 on the illustrative leaflet which however is not 

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:46.009
 we never have time to read 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.319
 especially at sea ​​I know that though 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.389
 precisely it is very important to apply 

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.009
 the cream especially after leaving 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:54.439
 from the water also because I don't want to 

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.400
 scare you but 90 percent of the 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.790
 wrinkles 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:02.300
 many other skin problems are 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.480
 caused by non- sun exposure 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:08.420
 correct however by an excessive 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.910
 sun exposure especially in the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.680
 warmer hours you should avoid 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.740
 expose yourself to the sun what I do 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:18.500
 from noon to 3am until 3am 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.050
 half 4 and my own invitation to stay under 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.210
 the sun because the rays in those in those 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.800
 hours are so strong that in fact 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:26.000
 therefore they can cause damage to the skin 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.980
 better to avoid 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.110
 something to be protected when exposed 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.700
 in the sun is the hair which is a lot 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.670
 especially important if you have them 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.620
 long, in short, you care and so I have 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.350
 I usually use coconut oil 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.040
 now I do not have here to show you but it is 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.260
 excellent really as a barrier for 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.980
 then it's great for sunlight 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.840
 because the city ​​for the super soft and 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.570
 hydrated is if you don't have what you are 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.280
 lots of other hair oils with 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.260
 protection factor precisely made on purpose 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.850
 to protect hair other things 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.709
 very important guys on solar 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.690
 before I forget that they always go 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:04.519
 applied half an hour an hour earlier 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.560
 there is also exposure to the sun 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.330
 always written on the back but often e 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.560
 gladly escapes us so it's a lot 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.390
 this is also important because 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.610
 otherwise in the first 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.260
 in short, in the first hour I saw neither 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.780
 for sun you can burn yourself then me 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.830
 I recommend before leaving home 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.480
 applied protection things I don't want 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.890
 that arrived at the beach in short, not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.450
 you have to think about staying there you can 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.360
 thrown into the water than what 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:29.030
 I usually do it so I guess 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.160
 six solar I told you just everything is 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.280
 once we finish the day at 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.959
 sea ​​we need to hydrate for 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.620
 good skin because it's one anyway 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.500
 stress for the skin to stay in the sun 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.959
 because you lose a lot of liquids then 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.819
 the skin must be hydrated what I use 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.680
 this is an after- sun for me 

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:50.500
 verna that I took in cia form 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:53.620
 alternative is another excellent product 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.879
 gel da lo is soothing and swimming 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.930
 refreshing and therefore in short from 

00:03:56.879 --> 00:04:00.940
 skin hydration then girls 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.829
 this 6 solar and almost everything 

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:04.870
 I still recommend something you are looking for 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:07.299
 find the suitable protection factor for 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.519
 your skin type and think that it is 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.079
 always better to use one a little bit more 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:13.209
 high rather kosar is one too 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:14.170
 low because precisely it is better to prevent 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.479
 that cure 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.150
 and no guys said this though 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:22.300
 there is always also a beautiful tan e 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:25.240
 healthy that in short is good because the sun 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:27.160
 it gives us vitamin d and therefore the important thing is 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.229
 protect yourself from options from 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.639
 sunburns and no girls this is 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.770
 everything will surely still be there 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:34.780
 something I had to tell you because you neither 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.250
 editing I see the video of coca flight 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.020
 I forgot this cabbage 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.110
 I'm forgotten, however, that short 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.539
 guys this is the juice and no kiss 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.070
 great next time 

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:48.340
 this time I am a community and I took it ed 

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:51.300
 is the ladurée keychain with also 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.300
 this is the rates
