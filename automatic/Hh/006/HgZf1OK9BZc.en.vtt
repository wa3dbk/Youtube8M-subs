 you are welcome as nothing today we are going to 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.270
 talk about fiber without fiber 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.800
 what one is always telling you the 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.410
 doctor who has to eat and that one 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.940
 never eat that that turns out to be so 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:08.530
 important when thinking about the 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:11.670
 digestion that fiber and that is fiber 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 fiber is all that 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.939
 It consumed through vegetables 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.939
 the cereals of the fruits and what 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.910
 and it does us good and it makes us ill say 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.160
 cellular nutrition level is to say no 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.520
 it is not poison us but neither do we 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.930
 nourishes and yet fulfills a function 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.360
 very important and very important 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.500
 specific that is to help us in the 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:40.390
 sweeping process of clearing out of 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.720
 excrete I said in the word serves 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.400
 excrete then that fiber is all this 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.800
 that we do not digest we do not have the capacity 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.950
 to digest it is to assimilate it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.720
 from unfolding me to assimilate it but what 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.420
 It goes through our entire digestive system 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:58.390
 through our intestine and helps us 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.660
 to be able to expel what we no longer need 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.030
 there is soluble fiber and fiber that 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.940
 is not soluble the soluble is the one that 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.619
 qualify let's say it like it does for 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.119
 example the mixed chia seeds the 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.190
 Chia seeds when they are put as 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.890
 gelatinous or for example in life that 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:19.060
 people tend to take it out of 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:22.060
 leave the flax seeds in water 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.540
 during the night good that army that 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.500
 it's soluble fiber that's rated well 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.390
 that when this 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.160
 in our intestine and makes contact and 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.280
 make contact with fat and with 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.680
 sugars then encapsulate and help us 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.560
 to drive them out that's why this fiber 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.640
 soluble is indicated for example in those 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:41.740
 cases in which you have to lower the 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.560
 cholesterol the sugar and all that kind of 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:48.310
 things and is the other fiber that is the no 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.390
 soluble that we always imagine it you know 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:55.630
 as as simply the saved by 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:57.520
 example like those hard bits of 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.230
 little or milky that there is out there that 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.840
 It did to me it occurs to me as always 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.420
 we have the idea of ​​something hard and little 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.280
 chewable or not very digestible well it is 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.709
 exactly that and in our gut 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.670
 It works like a broom to know how 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.560
 unesco just like when it 's in there 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:17.650
 going through our intestines helps 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:22.420
 to all we have to create for 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:25.180
 that comes out to the mass comes out and helps 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.800
 that comes out then to that mass that 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.780
 you need these meals there are also 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.510
 that hydrate her why that's so important 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.680
 water and fiber when thinking about 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:34.030
 improve all 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.609
 the problems that are always like 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.799
 complaining not about the stomach of 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.349
 colon intestine I do not know what about that 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:42.549
 It hurts that the belly is free 

00:03:41.349 --> 00:03:43.629
 Well, it's that you have to have a 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.810
 good digestion and we can not 

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:49.629
 accustom to not having a digestion 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.909
 normal we always think that once to the 

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:54.189
 week is normal, it is not normal once 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.139
 every other day is not normal either have to 

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:58.090
 go to the bathroom every day and you have to 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.090
 have a good digestion our 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.189
 Writer system is done and it works 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.560
 perfectly so that every day 

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:07.780
 we can expel everything that is no longer 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.150
 it serves us and we need it to be 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.769
 because otherwise all this of 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:13.540
 somehow it becomes a toxin that 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.849
 returns to the blood system and that 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.650
 it is there circulating circling and 

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:19.780
 doing us a lot of damage the body does not 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.090
 knows where to accommodate all this and good 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.639
 this comes from diseases and in 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.530
 subjects like the chubby the chubby also 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.180
 it comes out because there is no good digestion is 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.590
 because that toxin does not know where to accommodate 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.729
 the body but hey that's history 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:32.380
 of another or it is another matter 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:36.340
 because here what we are talking about 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:37.539
 it's the fiber that happens today with 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.880
 the issue of fiber because it does not 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:40.950
 we consume fiber 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:43.560
 that if we do not consume fruit then we go up 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:46.590
 vegetables we do not consume cereals not 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:48.600
 we have neither soluble nor soluble fiber not 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.430
 we have no army to be able 

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.920
 encapsulate what does not serve us or 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.960
 broom to be able to sweep what we do not 

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.450
 it serves so you have to increase the 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.640
 intake of the raw and of course the 

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.620
 intake of green and green I speak 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.420
 not only everything that has color 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:05.790
 green full of chlorophyll but also of 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:08.130
 the fruits make me understand everything 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:10.590
 what is natural what is natural 

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:13.740
 what comes from nature in its 

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:16.050
 state closest to its origin contains 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.390
 fiber so you have to consume the fiber 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.210
 so maybe some products that are 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.400
 sold today contain fiber but 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.710
 we really need the fiber that is 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:28.470
 there that comes from the earth because 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.340
 for that is to say everything works in 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:34.650
 a perfect system is there as I 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.300
 it works it balances me it heals me 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.890
 Detoxifies me back health and 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:39.870
 vitality then what to do 

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:41.600
 to improve the whole digestive system and 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.870
 of course the rest of the system 

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:47.320
 excretor 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.990
 is converted into commerce is necessary 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.600
 it is very important the package does not work 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:56.500
 that brings fiber serves the natural food 

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:58.990
 that already contains the fiber ok so to 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:01.270
 eat fiber and take a lot of course 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.830
 water to be able to improve us and not 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.260
 be complaining every time we eat 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:09.340
 because it's something rich in life is to eat 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.940
 and to eat you have to excrete because 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:14.910
 we are what we eat and what we evacuate 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.980
