00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the cell walls are thin which means this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.740 
the cell walls are thin which means this
part<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.489> wood<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> light<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.270> color<00:00:42.480> and

the sails is important because it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.750 
the sails is important because it
