 Hi, I'm Pedro Freitas. I work with product innovation at Netflix. 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.290
 Here's a quick guide to using Netflix on your Apple TV. 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.010
 You will find Netflix in the second row on the Apple TV menu. 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880
 The first time you log in, you will be presented with several ways 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.490
 to find something to look at. 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.340
 The Suggestions section for you gives you personal lists that are based on 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.920
 preferences and what you have seen. 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.630
 Navigate through the lists with the buttons on your Apple TV remote. 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.870
 When selecting a movie, more information is displayed and you can play, judge 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.850
 or see titles similar to the one you have chosen. 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.660

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.930
