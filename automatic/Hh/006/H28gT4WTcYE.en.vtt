where<00:00:20.250> we<00:00:20.520> actually<00:00:20.670> cut<00:00:21.590> between<00:00:22.789> these

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
where we actually cut between these

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.450 
where we actually cut between these
joints

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
joints

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.810 
joints
I've<00:00:26.460> cut<00:00:26.910> here<00:00:27.359> between<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:29.189> sixth<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
I've cut here between the sixth and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.170 
I've cut here between the sixth and
seventh<00:00:30.210> rib<00:00:30.570> from<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.410> head<00:00:31.740> end<00:00:32.009> and<00:00:32.340> that

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
seventh rib from the head end and that

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.560 
seventh rib from the head end and that
allows<00:00:33.719> me<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.559> clip<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.329> white

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
allows me just to clip this little white

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.590 
allows me just to clip this little white
line<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:37.200> cartilage<00:00:38.059> which<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.390> blade

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
line of cartilage which is the blade

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.680 
line of cartilage which is the blade

bone cartilage of the shoulder the more

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.290 
bone cartilage of the shoulder the more
of<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.079> cartilage<00:00:43.649> you<00:00:43.770> get<00:00:44.280> in<00:00:44.520> this<00:00:44.910> end<00:00:45.149> of

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
of that cartilage you get in this end of

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.229 
of that cartilage you get in this end of
the<00:00:45.420> loin<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:46.010> more<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.309> shoulder<00:00:47.610> you're

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
the loin the more of the shoulder you're

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.430 
the loin the more of the shoulder you're
actually<00:00:48.690> getting<00:00:48.920> onto<00:00:50.059> that<00:00:51.059> chop<00:00:51.440> so

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
actually getting onto that chop so

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.290 
actually getting onto that chop so
between<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:53.100> sixth<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:53.550> seventh<00:00:53.940> rib

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
between the sixth and seventh rib

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.020 
between the sixth and seventh rib
straight<00:00:55.079> through<00:00:55.469> gives<00:00:56.340> me<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.670> ideal

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
straight through gives me the ideal

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.650 
straight through gives me the ideal
cutting<00:00:57.510> off<00:00:57.660> point<00:00:57.989> on<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:59.250> rib<00:00:59.399> section<00:00:59.940> and

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
cutting off point on the rib section and

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.910 
cutting off point on the rib section and
I<00:01:00.930> turn<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.440> round<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:03.470> if<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:04.619> can<00:01:04.739> see

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
I turn this round and if you can see

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.750 
I turn this round and if you can see
that<00:01:05.100> little<00:01:05.309> white<00:01:05.610> tip<00:01:06.479> of<00:01:06.630> cartilage<00:01:07.200> there

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
that little white tip of cartilage there

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.210 
that little white tip of cartilage there
that<00:01:08.760> is<00:01:09.210> where<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.510> cut<00:01:10.020> between<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.500> first

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
that is where I cut between the first

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.240 
that is where I cut between the first
and<00:01:11.580> second<00:01:12.060> lumbar<00:01:12.240> vertebrae<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.350> that

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
and second lumbar vertebrae and that

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.450 
and second lumbar vertebrae and that
then<00:01:14.549> just<00:01:14.760> Clips<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.479> tip<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.900> hip<00:01:16.080> bone

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
then just Clips the tip of the hip bone

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.469 
then just Clips the tip of the hip bone
which<00:01:17.460> is<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> chump

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
which is the chump

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.789 
which is the chump
part<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.580> leg<00:01:20.810> so<00:01:21.810> cutting<00:01:22.500> at<00:01:22.619> those

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
part of the the leg so cutting at those

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.660 
part of the the leg so cutting at those
two<00:01:23.040> reference<00:01:23.520> points<00:01:23.750> gives<00:01:24.750> me<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> uniform

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
two reference points gives me a uniform

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.899 
two reference points gives me a uniform
middle<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:27.360> double<00:01:28.080> loin<00:01:28.290> as<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:29.490> has<00:01:29.729> the

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
middle or double loin as this has the

so<00:02:50.310> if<00:02:50.400> I<00:02:50.549> was<00:02:50.730> soaring<00:02:51.060> this<00:02:51.419> into<00:02:52.200> two

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
so if I was soaring this into two

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.679 
so if I was soaring this into two
separate<00:02:52.859> loins<00:02:53.129> I<00:02:53.459> would<00:02:54.060> follow<00:02:54.329> that

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:54.689 
separate loins I would follow that

00:02:54.689 --> 00:03:00.679 
separate loins I would follow that
centerline<00:02:55.409> carefully<00:02:56.780> but<00:02:59.030> to<00:03:00.030> separate<00:03:00.510> it

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
centerline carefully but to separate it

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:05.899 
centerline carefully but to separate it
as<00:03:01.049> a<00:03:01.109> loin<00:03:03.919> lumber<00:03:04.919> section<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.519> the<00:03:05.730> rib

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
as a loin lumber section and the rib

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:10.849 
as a loin lumber section and the rib
section<00:03:07.280> I'm<00:03:08.280> going<00:03:08.459> to<00:03:08.519> use<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.859> natural

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:10.859 
section I'm going to use the natural

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:13.879 
section I'm going to use the natural
joints<00:03:11.609> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.879> animal<00:03:12.239> as<00:03:12.569> my<00:03:13.229> cutting<00:03:13.650> guide

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
joints of the animal as my cutting guide

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.390 
joints of the animal as my cutting guide
and<00:03:14.750> here<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:15.900> have<00:03:16.109> the<00:03:16.349> cartilage<00:03:16.859> discs

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
and here we have the cartilage discs

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.039 
and here we have the cartilage discs
between<00:03:17.790> the<00:03:17.940> vertebrae<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:20.150> if<00:03:21.150> I<00:03:21.419> go

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
between the vertebrae and if I go

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:24.559 
between the vertebrae and if I go
through<00:03:22.319> this<00:03:22.500> one<00:03:22.739> here<00:03:23.129> and<00:03:23.310> cut<00:03:24.269> straight

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
through this one here and cut straight

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.780 
through this one here and cut straight
across<00:03:24.629> that<00:03:25.319> will<00:03:25.500> leave<00:03:25.769> me<00:03:26.010> all<00:03:26.220> this<00:03:26.519> rib

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
across that will leave me all this rib

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.860 
across that will leave me all this rib
section<00:03:27.299> and<00:03:28.609> the<00:03:29.609> rest<00:03:29.849> will<00:03:30.030> be<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.540> lumber

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
section and the rest will be the lumber

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.649 
section and the rest will be the lumber

head of the ribs through the cartilage

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.800 
head of the ribs through the cartilage
discs<00:03:54.870> we've<00:03:55.739> separated<00:03:56.269> the<00:03:57.269> double<00:03:57.599> loin

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
discs we've separated the double loin

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.759 
discs we've separated the double loin
into<00:03:58.199> our<00:03:58.859> rib<00:03:59.329> section<00:04:00.329> and<00:04:00.540> our<00:04:01.319> lumber
