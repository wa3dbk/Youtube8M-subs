like about the kettlebell number one the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:54.460 
shape sometimes it makes it easier to

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.939 
shape sometimes it makes it easier to
lift<00:00:55.059> and<00:00:55.269> carry<00:00:55.449> so<00:00:55.809> if<00:00:56.140> we're<00:00:56.260> doing<00:00:56.350> farmers

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.050 
in your leg and it's just a little bit

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.260 
in your leg and it's just a little bit
awkward<00:01:26.370> one<00:01:27.370> of<00:01:27.460> the<00:01:27.550> nice<00:01:27.700> things<00:01:28.000> about<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
awkward one of the nice things about the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.930 
awkward one of the nice things about the
kettlebell<00:01:28.720> too<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.230> that<00:01:29.590> we<00:01:29.710> can<00:01:29.890> do<00:01:30.070> swings

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:30.940 
kettlebell too is that we can do swings

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.260 
kettlebell too is that we can do swings
with<00:01:31.210> it<00:01:31.470> which<00:01:32.470> let<00:01:32.740> us<00:01:32.860> really<00:01:33.130> work<00:01:34.000> on

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
with it which let us really work on

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.960 
with it which let us really work on
using<00:01:34.930> that<00:01:35.140> posterior<00:01:35.920> chain<00:01:36.190> using<00:01:36.610> our<00:01:36.700> hip

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:36.970 
using that posterior chain using our hip

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.190 
using that posterior chain using our hip
extensors<00:01:37.630> our<00:01:38.050> hip<00:01:38.320> drivers<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.810> is<00:01:41.020> the

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
extensors our hip drivers so it is the

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.640 
extensors our hip drivers so it is the
real<00:01:41.320> deal

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
real deal

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.980 
real deal
but<00:01:42.310> don't<00:01:42.580> just<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.270> know<00:01:43.330> pick<00:01:43.540> it<00:01:43.690> up<00:01:43.810> and

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
but don't just you know pick it up and

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.050 
but don't just you know pick it up and
start<00:01:44.260> swinging<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.770> around<00:01:44.860> or<00:01:45.340> trying<00:01:45.880> to<00:01:45.910> do

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
start swinging it around or trying to do

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.750 
start swinging it around or trying to do
windmills<00:01:46.540> or<00:01:46.750> things<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.050> that

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
windmills or things like that

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.250 
windmills or things like that
there<00:01:48.760> are<00:01:48.910> techniques<00:01:49.360> it's<00:01:49.990> like<00:01:50.230> a

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:50.260 
there are techniques it's like a

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.110 
there are techniques it's like a
language<00:01:50.800> there<00:01:51.220> are<00:01:51.340> steps<00:01:51.640> to<00:01:51.790> take<00:01:52.060> and

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
language there are steps to take and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.910 
language there are steps to take and

hands straight down to that handle and
then<00:03:20.000> from<00:03:20.240> this<00:03:20.390> position<00:03:20.990> I<00:03:21.200> imagine<00:03:21.980> that

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
then from this position I imagine that

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.580 
then from this position I imagine that
I'm<00:03:22.220> trying<00:03:22.520> to<00:03:22.580> bend<00:03:22.930> the<00:03:23.930> handle<00:03:24.350> like<00:03:24.530> that

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
I'm trying to bend the handle like that

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.040 
I'm trying to bend the handle like that
what<00:03:25.340> that<00:03:25.490> does<00:03:25.670> is<00:03:25.820> it<00:03:25.970> kind<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.300> brings<00:03:26.870> my

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
what that does is it kind of brings my

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.620 
what that does is it kind of brings my
shoulders<00:03:27.560> back<00:03:27.740> and<00:03:28.010> helps<00:03:28.730> lock<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.450> that

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
shoulders back and helps lock in that

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:32.320 
shoulders back and helps lock in that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:47.090 
exercise it's what grade coke I think

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.210 
exercise it's what grade coke I think
would<00:04:47.180> call<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.360> self-limiting<00:04:48.200> exercise<00:04:48.710> if

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:49.220 
would call a self-limiting exercise if

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.260 
would call a self-limiting exercise if
you<00:04:49.340> don't<00:04:49.550> have<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.880> shoulder

you don't have the shoulder
stabilization<00:04:50.770> you're<00:04:51.770> not<00:04:51.919> going<00:04:52.070> to<00:04:52.160> be

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
stabilization you're not going to be

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.280 
stabilization you're not going to be
able<00:04:52.310> to<00:04:52.430> hold<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:53.330> kettlebell<00:04:53.780> there

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
able to hold that kettlebell there

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:55.930 
able to hold that kettlebell there
this<00:04:54.620> is<00:04:54.830> shoulder<00:04:55.190> internal<00:04:55.760> and<00:04:55.880> external

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
this is shoulder internal and external

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.170 
this is shoulder internal and external
rotation<00:04:57.070> watch<00:04:58.070> out<00:04:58.250> for<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> cheater<00:04:58.850> move

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
rotation watch out for the cheater move

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:02.560 
rotation watch out for the cheater move
which<00:04:59.960> is<00:05:00.200> to<00:05:00.650> grab<00:05:00.889> the<00:05:01.070> kettlebell<00:05:01.580> on<00:05:01.820> the

which is to grab the kettlebell on the
corner<00:05:03.080> because<00:05:03.860> then<00:05:04.300> it's<00:05:05.300> a<00:05:05.510> lot<00:05:05.660> easier<00:05:05.720> to

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
corner because then it's a lot easier to

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.950 
corner because then it's a lot easier to
just<00:05:06.980> kind<00:05:07.220> of<00:05:07.310> hold<00:05:07.490> it<00:05:07.760> with<00:05:08.330> your<00:05:08.360> grip<00:05:08.750> when

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
you could never do that like grasping it

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.719 
you could never do that like grasping it
