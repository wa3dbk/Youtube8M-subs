 not work and in view of the 2d view of 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.710

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:49.110
 wait for it to add one you check 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:50.610

 really super simple route 1 and 5 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:04.230
 like any other phone I know that 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.390
 of simple explained on a lot of 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:10.200
 forums but I still wanted to 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:12.690
 do a video tutorial for people who 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.630
 prefer the video these shows up 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.280
 this is normal and normal and the 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.780
 phone will start I prefer to do 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.730
 a little video for people who 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.760
 prefer to follow little tutorial seems 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:27.500
 Quick with voice inspections and 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.760
 paul get lost and who do not like to read 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.440

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.569
 so that's normal do not stop 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.180
 unoccupied to check each application 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.139
