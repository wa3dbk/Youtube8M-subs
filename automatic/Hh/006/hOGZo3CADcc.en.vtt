Unchained<00:00:04.850> what<00:00:05.850> do<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.000> call<00:00:06.149> phenolics<00:00:06.509> so

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
Unchained what do we call phenolics so

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.009 
Unchained what do we call phenolics so
they<00:00:07.470> when<00:00:07.649> they<00:00:07.740> are<00:00:07.859> n<00:00:08.269> their<00:00:09.269> effect<00:00:09.750> their

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
they when they are n their effect their

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.850 
they when they are n their effect their
essential<00:00:10.530> effect<00:00:10.889> as<00:00:11.420> as<00:00:12.420> their<00:00:12.809> a<00:00:13.139> component

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
essential effect as as their a component

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.570 
essential effect as as their a component
of<00:00:13.920> wine<00:00:14.190> is<00:00:14.960> at<00:00:15.960> least<00:00:16.200> as<00:00:16.439> we<00:00:16.650> perceive<00:00:17.220> it<00:00:17.430> as

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
of wine is at least as we perceive it as

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
of wine is at least as we perceive it as
a<00:00:17.609> component<00:00:18.000> of<00:00:18.180> wine<00:00:18.330> is<00:00:18.630> in<00:00:19.439> its<00:00:19.769> effect<00:00:20.250> on

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
a component of wine is in its effect on

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.720 
a component of wine is in its effect on
changing<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.210> shape<00:00:21.570> of<00:00:21.810> the<00:00:21.990> protein<00:00:22.730> mucin

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
changing the shape of the protein mucin

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.810 
changing the shape of the protein mucin
so<00:00:24.510> mucin<00:00:24.930> which<00:00:25.230> is<00:00:25.349> always<00:00:25.859> present<00:00:26.340> is

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
so mucin which is always present is

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.550 
so mucin which is always present is
slippery<00:00:27.179> at<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> lubricant<00:00:28.019> yeah<00:00:28.199> because

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
slippery at the lubricant yeah because

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919 
slippery at the lubricant yeah because
it<00:00:28.800> exists<00:00:29.160> as<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> film<00:00:29.640> that's<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.779> the

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
it exists as a film that's because the

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.140 
it exists as a film that's because the
shape<00:00:31.140> of<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.349> protein<00:00:31.940> molecule<00:00:32.940> has<00:00:33.090> a

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:33.150 
shape of the protein molecule has a

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.030 
shape of the protein molecule has a
particular<00:00:33.660> shape<00:00:33.690> that<00:00:34.080> forms<00:00:34.440> of<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> films

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
particular shape that forms of the films

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.150 
particular shape that forms of the films
and<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.170> what<00:00:37.170> happens<00:00:37.530> is<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:38.010> the

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
and so what happens is that in the

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.030 
and so what happens is that in the
presence<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.960> cannons<00:00:39.960> these<00:00:40.200> different

the protein itself the molecule the
protein<00:00:53.340> itself<00:00:53.520> changes<00:00:53.820> shape<00:00:54.470> so<00:00:56.150> and<00:00:57.150> this

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
protein itself changes shape so and this

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.690 
protein itself changes shape so and this
is<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.630> proteins<00:00:58.380> are<00:00:58.560> are<00:00:58.980> notorious<00:00:59.670> for

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
is this proteins are are notorious for

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.700 
is this proteins are are notorious for
having<00:00:59.940> loose<00:01:00.300> shapes<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.050> he<00:01:01.200> can<00:01:01.320> change

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
different changes of shape perhaps width

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.640 
different changes of shape perhaps width
of<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.210> filament<00:02:17.710> and<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.180> degree<00:02:20.720> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
of the filament and and the degree the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.060 
of the filament and and the degree the
exact<00:02:21.980> degree<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.730> which<00:02:23.230> the<00:02:24.230> protein

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
exact degree to which the protein

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.880 
exact degree to which the protein
changes<00:02:25.310> shape<00:02:25.640> and<00:02:25.820> so<00:02:26.140> you<00:02:27.140> get<00:02:27.350> to<00:02:27.650> get<00:02:27.860> a

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
changes shape and so you get to get a

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.370 
changes shape and so you get to get a
different<00:02:28.310> sense<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:29.000> about<00:02:29.720> of<00:02:29.930> tannins<00:02:30.320> and

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
different sense of about of tannins and

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.500 
different sense of about of tannins and
they<00:02:30.530> and<00:02:30.830> they<00:02:30.860> may<00:02:31.250> be<00:02:31.310> you<00:02:32.150> know<00:02:32.270> they<00:02:32.360> may

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
they and they may be you know they may

they and they may be you know they may
be<00:02:32.570> dramatic<00:02:33.440> sometimes<00:02:33.709> they<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.100> be<00:02:34.190> really

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
of the normal lumigan so you have been

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.770 
of the normal lumigan so you have been
fat<00:03:34.220> it's<00:03:34.370> okay<00:03:34.640> there<00:03:34.790> we<00:03:34.880> are<00:03:35.000> nice

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
fat it's okay there we are nice

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:38.380 
fat it's okay there we are nice
texturally<00:03:36.680> again<00:03:37.010> right<00:03:37.310> so<00:03:37.700> between<00:03:38.090> the

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:38.390 
texturally again right so between the

texturally again right so between the
two<00:03:38.630> there's<00:03:38.959> this<00:03:39.110> there's<00:03:39.170> a<00:03:39.440> contrapuntal

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
two there's this there's a contrapuntal

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.699 
two there's this there's a contrapuntal
game<00:03:40.310> of<00:03:40.580> of<00:03:41.209> textures<00:03:41.900> and<00:03:42.170> is<00:03:42.260> that<00:03:42.410> enriches

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 
game of of textures and is that enriches

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.920 
game of of textures and is that enriches
you<00:03:43.250> taste<00:03:43.549> more<00:03:43.910> and<00:03:44.180> then<00:03:44.510> you<00:03:44.660> have<00:03:44.810> this

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
you taste more and then you have this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.449 
you taste more and then you have this
beautiful<00:03:45.170> textural<00:03:45.769> game<00:03:45.950> that's<00:03:46.160> going<00:03:46.370> on

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
beautiful textural game that's going on

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.640 
beautiful textural game that's going on
it's<00:03:47.000> almost<00:03:47.150> universally<00:03:48.019> the<00:03:48.170> case<00:03:48.380> in

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:48.650 
it's almost universally the case in

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.930 
it's almost universally the case in
areas<00:03:49.280> where<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.570> agricultural<00:03:51.260> systems

that you have simple cuisines you know

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.670 
that you have simple cuisines you know
not<00:04:00.440> arch<00:04:00.709> complex<00:04:01.370> cuisines<00:04:02.410> like<00:04:03.410> the<00:04:03.530> ones

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
not arch complex cuisines like the ones

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.100 
not arch complex cuisines like the ones
you<00:04:03.739> have<00:04:03.860> in<00:04:03.980> Provence<00:04:04.370> for<00:04:04.489> example<00:04:05.019> but<00:04:06.019> you

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
you have in Provence for example but you

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.630 
you have in Provence for example but you
have<00:04:06.230> tana<00:04:06.470> coin<00:04:06.680> Tuscany's<00:04:07.190> another<00:04:07.400> place

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:07.640 
have tana coin Tuscany's another place

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.420 
have tana coin Tuscany's another place
it's<00:04:08.269> like<00:04:08.330> so<00:04:08.720> so<00:04:09.049> we<00:04:09.140> have<00:04:09.290> sangiovese<00:04:09.770> and

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
it's like so so we have sangiovese and

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.940 
it's like so so we have sangiovese and
so<00:04:10.640> he's<00:04:11.540> taking<00:04:11.720> on<00:04:11.990> retainer<00:04:12.410> ready<00:04:12.650> other

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
so he's taking on retainer ready other

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.650 
so he's taking on retainer ready other
places<00:04:13.310> though<00:04:13.730> like<00:04:13.940> say

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
places though like say

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.850
