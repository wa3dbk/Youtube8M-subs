00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.029 
my studio the first one we're going to
look<00:00:25.630> at<00:00:25.779> is<00:00:25.900> the<00:00:26.020> Carl<00:00:26.200> Martin<00:00:26.439> compressor

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.039 
look at is the Carl Martin compressor

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:29.729 
look at is the Carl Martin compressor
and<00:00:27.189> limiter<00:00:28.320> I'm<00:00:29.320> going<00:00:29.500> to<00:00:29.559> demonstrate

00:00:29.729 --> 00:00:29.739 
and limiter I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:31.799 
and limiter I'm going to demonstrate
playing<00:00:30.700> without<00:00:31.210> it<00:00:31.360> and<00:00:31.419> then<00:00:31.540> playing<00:00:31.719> with

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:31.809 
playing without it and then playing with

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:33.600 
playing without it and then playing with
it<00:00:32.079> and<00:00:32.230> you'll<00:00:32.320> see<00:00:32.469> the<00:00:32.590> difference<00:00:32.920> the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
it and you'll see the difference the

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.389 
it and you'll see the difference the
great<00:00:33.850> things<00:00:34.059> about<00:00:34.120> these<00:00:34.420> pedals<00:00:35.280> one<00:00:36.280> of

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
great things about these pedals one of

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:38.580 
great things about these pedals one of
the<00:00:36.460> great<00:00:36.610> things<00:00:36.820> is<00:00:37.000> that<00:00:37.840> they're<00:00:38.110> 12<00:00:38.350> volt

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
the great things is that they're 12 volt

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.010 
the great things is that they're 12 volt
pedals<00:00:38.950> so<00:00:39.399> they<00:00:40.059> have<00:00:40.149> a<00:00:40.239> very<00:00:40.450> robust<00:00:40.780> power

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
pedals so they have a very robust power

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.350 
pedals so they have a very robust power
supply<00:00:41.469> and<00:00:41.739> a<00:00:42.100> lot<00:00:42.280> of<00:00:42.399> open<00:00:42.820> top-end<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:45.360> so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
supply and a lot of open top-end and so

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.000 
supply and a lot of open top-end and so
they<00:00:46.510> sound<00:00:46.750> better<00:00:47.050> than<00:00:47.470> most<00:00:47.740> of<00:00:47.920> the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.010 
they sound better than most of the

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.319 
they sound better than most of the
pedals<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.340> buy<00:00:48.490> that<00:00:48.730> are<00:00:48.910> just<00:00:49.180> regular

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
pedals you buy that are just regular

00:00:49.329 --> 00:01:20.820 
pedals you buy that are just regular
nivel<00:00:49.990> battery<00:00:50.560> pedals<00:00:50.860> so<00:00:51.220> here<00:00:52.150> we<00:00:52.239> go

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.950 

so<00:01:21.830> now<00:01:22.150> I'm<00:01:23.150> going<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.360> record<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.810> track

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
so now I'm going to record the track

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.250 
so now I'm going to record the track
with<00:01:24.650> the<00:01:24.770> compressor<00:01:25.160> on<00:01:25.340> and<00:01:25.960> you'll<00:01:26.960> see

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
with the compressor on and you'll see

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.250 
with the compressor on and you'll see
it'll<00:01:27.410> just<00:01:27.650> wake<00:01:27.920> up<00:01:28.070> the<00:01:28.190> track<00:01:28.990> at<00:01:29.990> the<00:01:30.080> same

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
it'll just wake up the track at the same

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.250 
it'll just wake up the track at the same
time<00:01:30.500> even<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.340> out<00:01:31.580> in<00:01:32.000> a<00:01:32.330> really<00:01:32.720> musical<00:01:32.810> way

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
time even it out in a really musical way

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.410 
time even it out in a really musical way
in<00:01:33.800> a<00:01:34.400> way<00:01:34.490> that<00:01:34.640> you<00:01:34.730> don't<00:01:34.820> really<00:01:35.060> hear<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
in a way that you don't really hear the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.780 
in a way that you don't really hear the
compressor<00:01:35.900> it<00:01:36.890> kind<00:01:37.070> of<00:01:37.100> fattens<00:01:37.490> it<00:01:37.640> and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
compressor it kind of fattens it and

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.670 
compressor it kind of fattens it and
wakes<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.450> up<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:38.810> I<00:01:38.870> add<00:01:39.020> up<00:01:39.170> quite<00:01:39.410> a<00:01:39.440> bit<00:01:39.590> of

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
wakes it up and I add up quite a bit of

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.690 
wakes it up and I add up quite a bit of
gain<00:01:39.830> which<00:01:39.980> is<00:01:40.070> one<00:01:40.190> of<00:01:40.220> my<00:01:40.310> favorite<00:01:40.580> things

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
gain which is one of my favorite things

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.550 
gain which is one of my favorite things
to<00:01:40.820> do<00:01:40.910> with<00:01:40.970> this<00:01:41.120> compressor<00:01:41.510> too<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.930> by

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
to do with this compressor too and by

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.050 
to do with this compressor too and by
the<00:01:42.620> way<00:01:42.800> this<00:01:42.950> is<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.160> michael<00:01:43.460> tunnel<00:01:43.730> straps

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
the way this is a michael tunnel straps

00:01:44.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
the way this is a michael tunnel straps
awesome<00:01:44.570> instrument<00:01:44.930> here<00:01:45.740> we<00:01:45.830> go

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.800 

so<00:02:14.530> the<00:02:14.920> compressor<00:02:15.310> I<00:02:15.700> don't<00:02:16.629> know<00:02:16.689> if<00:02:16.750> you

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
so the compressor I don't know if you

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.080 
so the compressor I don't know if you
noticed<00:02:17.230> but<00:02:17.469> really<00:02:18.189> fattens<00:02:18.579> up<00:02:18.730> a<00:02:18.849> clean

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
noticed but really fattens up a clean

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.039 
noticed but really fattens up a clean
tone<00:02:19.390> and<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:20.560> gain<00:02:20.799> knob<00:02:21.040> actually<00:02:21.870> adds<00:02:22.870> a

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.049 
tone and the gain knob actually adds a

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:25.080 
tone and the gain knob actually adds a
little<00:02:23.349> bit<00:02:23.469> of<00:02:23.560> a<00:02:23.620> nice<00:02:23.859> push<00:02:24.310> in<00:02:24.700> front<00:02:25.000> of

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
little bit of a nice push in front of

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.539 
little bit of a nice push in front of
the<00:02:25.150> amp<00:02:25.409> which<00:02:26.409> I<00:02:26.560> love<00:02:26.739> I<00:02:26.859> love<00:02:26.890> exploding

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
the amp which I love I love exploding

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:28.860 
the amp which I love I love exploding
the<00:02:27.609> front<00:02:27.849> end<00:02:27.969> of<00:02:28.060> an<00:02:28.150> amp<00:02:28.299> and<00:02:28.480> this<00:02:28.569> does<00:02:28.750> it

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
the front end of an amp and this does it

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.960 
the front end of an amp and this does it
in<00:02:28.959> a<00:02:28.989> very<00:02:29.049> musical<00:02:29.319> way<00:02:29.680> and<00:02:29.950> if<00:02:30.549> you<00:02:30.640> notice

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
in a very musical way and if you notice

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.089 
in a very musical way and if you notice
I<00:02:31.150> was<00:02:31.180> able<00:02:31.390> to<00:02:31.510> really<00:02:31.870> slam<00:02:32.470> on<00:02:32.680> the<00:02:32.769> guitar

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:33.099 
I was able to really slam on the guitar

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:35.910 
I was able to really slam on the guitar
and<00:02:33.459> it<00:02:34.269> still<00:02:34.870> sounded<00:02:35.200> very<00:02:35.470> even<00:02:35.829> and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
and it still sounded very even and

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.369 
and it still sounded very even and
smooth<00:02:36.250> but<00:02:37.060> without<00:02:37.359> revealing<00:02:37.900> that<00:02:38.230> there

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:38.379 
smooth but without revealing that there

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:39.720 
smooth but without revealing that there
was<00:02:38.500> a<00:02:38.530> compressor<00:02:38.950> on<00:02:38.980> I<00:02:39.099> really<00:02:39.430> love<00:02:39.579> this

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730
