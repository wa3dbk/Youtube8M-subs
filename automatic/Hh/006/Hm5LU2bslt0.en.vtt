I<00:02:07.810> think<00:02:08.530> some<00:02:08.710> of<00:02:08.830> the<00:02:08.950> most<00:02:09.310> important<00:02:09.910> tools

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
I think some of the most important tools

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.010 
I think some of the most important tools
you're<00:02:10.690> going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.869> see<00:02:11.110> are<00:02:11.520> right<00:02:12.520> here<00:02:13.020> this

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
you're going to see are right here this

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.410 
you're going to see are right here this
tells<00:02:14.320> you<00:02:14.440> the<00:02:14.470> smart<00:02:14.890> data<00:02:15.100> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.970> hard

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
tells you the smart data of the hard

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.760 
tells you the smart data of the hard
drive<00:02:16.750> and<00:02:17.050> if<00:02:17.710> it<00:02:17.860> finds<00:02:18.130> any<00:02:18.340> errors<00:02:19.170> if<00:02:20.170> you

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
drive and if it finds any errors if you

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.750 
drive and if it finds any errors if you
see<00:02:21.010> here<00:02:21.540> we<00:02:22.540> have<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.720> couple<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.200> errors<00:02:23.760> now

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
see here we have a couple of errors now

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.699 
see here we have a couple of errors now
that<00:02:24.940> doesn't<00:02:25.150> immediately<00:02:25.720> mean<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.560> there

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:26.709 
that doesn't immediately mean that there

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:29.910 
that doesn't immediately mean that there
are<00:02:26.830> problems<00:02:27.160> but<00:02:28.090> it<00:02:28.360> is<00:02:28.709> somewhat<00:02:29.709> of<00:02:29.830> an

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
are problems but it is somewhat of an

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.460 
are problems but it is somewhat of an
indicator<00:02:30.430> so<00:02:31.209> if<00:02:31.630> you<00:02:31.810> start<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.170> see<00:02:32.320> these

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
indicator so if you start to see these

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.100 
indicator so if you start to see these
numbers<00:02:32.920> climb<00:02:33.280> very<00:02:33.580> high<00:02:33.850> it<00:02:34.209> may<00:02:34.690> be<00:02:34.720> time

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
numbers climb very high it may be time

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.050 
numbers climb very high it may be time
to<00:02:35.140> get<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> new<00:02:35.620> hard<00:02:35.860> drive<00:02:41.670> right<00:02:42.670> here

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
to get a new hard drive right here

to get a new hard drive right here
you're<00:02:43.660> going<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.840> see<00:02:44.050> your<00:02:44.230> time<00:02:44.440> remaining

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
you're going to see your time remaining

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:46.770 
you're going to see your time remaining
after<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:45.670> minute<00:02:45.940> it'll<00:02:46.330> be<00:02:46.540> able<00:02:46.630> to

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
after one minute it'll be able to

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.320 
after one minute it'll be able to
estimate<00:02:47.020> there<00:02:47.980> we<00:02:48.160> go<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.489> long<00:02:48.760> it's<00:02:49.120> going

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
estimate there we go how long it's going

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:53.040 
estimate there we go how long it's going

temperature of 28 is very good it will

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.900 
temperature of 28 is very good it will
tell<00:02:56.170> you<00:02:56.410> if<00:02:56.560> it<00:02:56.709> gets<00:02:56.890> too<00:02:57.160> hot<00:02:57.370> so<00:02:57.760> you<00:02:57.820> don't

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
tell you if it gets too hot so you don't

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.580 
tell you if it gets too hot so you don't
really<00:02:58.209> have<00:02:58.330> to<00:02:58.600> worry<00:02:58.780> about<00:02:58.840> monitoring

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
really have to worry about monitoring

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.580 
really have to worry about monitoring
that<00:02:59.770> it'll<00:03:00.430> tell<00:03:00.640> you<00:03:00.850> you<00:03:01.570> know<00:03:01.690> a<00:03:02.020> warning

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
that it'll tell you you know a warning

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.820 
that it'll tell you you know a warning
and<00:03:02.800> then<00:03:03.430> once<00:03:04.030> it<00:03:04.180> gets<00:03:04.209> way<00:03:05.050> too<00:03:05.080> hot<00:03:05.320> it'll

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
and then once it gets way too hot it'll

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:16.789 
and then once it gets way too hot it'll
just<00:03:06.310> say<00:03:06.459> can't<00:03:06.790> go<00:03:07.239> on<00:03:07.390> anymore

this dynasts that recovery right here is
where<00:03:20.440> you'll<00:03:20.590> see<00:03:20.830> if<00:03:21.269> spinrite<00:03:22.269> comes<00:03:22.780> to<00:03:23.080> a

where you'll see if spinrite comes to a

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.380 
where you'll see if spinrite comes to a
section<00:03:23.560> of<00:03:23.680> your<00:03:23.769> hard<00:03:24.040> drive<00:03:24.400> where<00:03:25.180> it

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
section of your hard drive where it

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.289 
section of your hard drive where it
seems<00:03:25.690> damaged<00:03:26.349> or<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.980> data<00:03:27.640> is<00:03:27.940> slightly

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:28.299 
seems damaged or the data is slightly

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.720 
seems damaged or the data is slightly
unreadable<00:03:28.870> what<00:03:29.590> what<00:03:29.950> it<00:03:30.040> will<00:03:30.159> do<00:03:30.430> is

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
unreadable what what it will do is

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.009 
unreadable what what it will do is
iterate<00:03:31.360> through<00:03:31.900> each<00:03:32.470> of<00:03:32.829> the<00:03:32.980> bytes<00:03:33.280> and

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
iterate through each of the bytes and

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.190 
iterate through each of the bytes and
invert<00:03:35.019> them<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.640> invert<00:03:36.640> them<00:03:36.819> again<00:03:37.200> and

invert them and invert them again and

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.319 
invert them and invert them again and
what<00:03:38.530> this<00:03:38.680> does<00:03:38.950> is<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.459> makes<00:03:39.970> it<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.299> that

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
what this does is it makes it so that

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:42.869 
what this does is it makes it so that
your<00:03:40.659> system<00:03:41.079> can<00:03:41.230> read<00:03:41.500> it<00:03:41.620> again<00:03:41.860> I've<00:03:42.579> had<00:03:42.819> a

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
your system can read it again I've had a

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:45.180 
your system can read it again I've had a
great<00:03:43.299> success<00:03:43.599> rate<00:03:44.170> with<00:03:44.530> hard<00:03:44.829> drives<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
great success rate with hard drives that

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.430 
great success rate with hard drives that
are<00:03:45.310> dying<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:46.360> run<00:03:46.629> through<00:03:46.840> this<00:03:46.959> one<00:03:47.170> time

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:47.440 
are dying you run through this one time

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:49.759 
are dying you run through this one time
and<00:03:47.680> then<00:03:47.769> you<00:03:47.860> can<00:03:48.010> get<00:03:48.099> all<00:03:48.250> the<00:03:48.400> data<00:03:48.609> off

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:49.769 
and then you can get all the data off

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.920 
and then you can get all the data off
it's<00:03:50.769> a<00:03:50.920> really<00:03:51.220> great<00:03:51.340> piece<00:03:51.579> of<00:03:51.640> software<00:03:52.150> I

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.410 

even<00:03:55.930> used<00:03:56.109> it<00:03:56.260> one<00:03:56.500> time<00:03:56.530> a<00:03:57.220> Macbook<00:03:58.180> hard

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
even used it one time a Macbook hard

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.009 
even used it one time a Macbook hard
drive<00:03:58.750> had<00:03:59.349> gone<00:04:00.129> south<00:04:00.489> and<00:04:00.879> I<00:04:01.540> pulled<00:04:01.870> the

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
drive had gone south and I pulled the

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.860 
drive had gone south and I pulled the
hard<00:04:02.260> drive<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.920> use<00:04:03.129> the<00:04:03.280> desktop<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.659> use

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
hard drive and use the desktop to use

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.539 
hard drive and use the desktop to use
spin<00:04:05.170> right<00:04:05.379> on<00:04:05.500> the<00:04:05.620> hard<00:04:05.829> drive<00:04:06.129> and<00:04:06.400> then

00:04:06.539 --> 00:04:06.549 
spin right on the hard drive and then

00:04:06.549 --> 00:04:09.030 
spin right on the hard drive and then
plugged<00:04:06.819> it<00:04:06.940> back<00:04:06.970> into<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.480> Mac<00:04:07.690> and<00:04:08.019> got<00:04:08.890> the

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
plugged it back into the Mac and got the

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.119 
plugged it back into the Mac and got the
data<00:04:09.250> off<00:04:09.519> so<00:04:10.390> it's<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.629> it's<00:04:10.840> well<00:04:11.530> worth<00:04:11.799> it<00:04:11.980> to

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
data off so it's a it's well worth it to

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:15.319 
data off so it's a it's well worth it to
get<00:04:12.220> this<00:04:12.400> program<00:04:12.700> I<00:04:13.299> highly<00:04:13.989> recommend<00:04:14.470> it

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
get this program I highly recommend it

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.539 
get this program I highly recommend it
just<00:04:16.329> leave<00:04:16.539> it<00:04:16.570> overnight<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.380> you<00:04:18.370> got<00:04:18.519> a

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
just leave it overnight and you got a

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.039 
just leave it overnight and you got a
great<00:04:18.820> chance<00:04:18.850> of<00:04:19.269> getting<00:04:19.479> your<00:04:19.600> data<00:04:19.780> back

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
great chance of getting your data back

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.650 
great chance of getting your data back
one<00:04:20.380> thing<00:04:20.709> to<00:04:20.919> note<00:04:21.190> is<00:04:21.400> this<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.090> for<00:04:22.419> hard

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
one thing to note is this is for hard
