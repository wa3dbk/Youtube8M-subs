of<00:00:54.969> integral<00:00:55.390> color<00:00:55.600> so<00:00:56.410> you<00:00:56.500> see<00:00:56.800> the

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
of integral color so you see the

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.740 
of integral color so you see the
different<00:00:57.309> sizes<00:00:57.579> that's<00:00:58.120> because<00:00:58.539> there's

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
different sizes that's because there's

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.900 
different sizes that's because there's
different<00:00:59.140> tint<00:00:59.829> loads<00:01:00.100> or<00:01:00.280> pigment<00:01:00.730> loads

inside<00:01:01.359> of<00:01:01.510> these<00:01:01.629> buckets<00:01:01.899> and<00:01:02.289> to<00:01:03.250> simplify

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:03.789 
inside of these buckets and to simplify

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:06.480 
inside of these buckets and to simplify
it<00:01:03.850> one<00:01:04.570> of<00:01:04.720> these<00:01:04.869> cans<00:01:05.289> will<00:01:06.190> color

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
it one of these cans will color

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.359 
it one of these cans will color
condition<00:01:07.180> one<00:01:07.539> cubic<00:01:07.990> yard<00:01:08.020> of<00:01:08.320> concrete<00:01:08.860> so

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:09.369 
condition one cubic yard of concrete so

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.060 
condition one cubic yard of concrete so
it's<00:01:09.550> very<00:01:09.759> convenient<00:01:10.500> also<00:01:11.500> you<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.860> get

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
it's very convenient also you can get

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.510 
it's very convenient also you can get

where<00:01:21.310> you<00:01:21.399> would<00:01:21.550> use<00:01:21.759> integral<00:01:22.149> color

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
where you would use integral color

stair risers and treads is perfect for

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.330 
stair risers and treads is perfect for
using<00:01:25.899> integral<00:01:26.259> color<00:01:26.470> because<00:01:26.890> it<00:01:27.039> colors

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:27.340 
using integral color because it colors

using integral color a couple of things

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.389 
using integral color a couple of things
to<00:01:37.989> be<00:01:38.080> concerned<00:01:38.110> about<00:01:38.619> when<00:01:39.099> pouring

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:41.860 
the ready mix batch plant so what we did

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.390 
the ready mix batch plant so what we did
is<00:02:42.190> we<00:02:42.220> picked<00:02:43.090> our<00:02:43.380> final<00:02:44.380> color<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:44.920> we

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
is we picked our final color and we

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.030 
is we picked our final color and we
delivered<00:02:45.910> six<00:02:46.330> of<00:02:46.510> these<00:02:46.660> units<00:02:47.230> six<00:02:47.920> of

these cans to our ready mix plant and

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.710 
these cans to our ready mix plant and
they<00:02:50.770> actually<00:02:51.250> mixed<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.880> into<00:02:52.330> the<00:02:52.480> mix

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
they actually mixed it into the mix

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.810 
they actually mixed it into the mix

I've<00:02:57.460> seen<00:02:57.820> problems<00:02:58.120> in<00:02:58.450> the<00:02:58.570> past<00:02:58.750> where<00:02:59.170> the

I've seen problems in the past where the

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.650 
I've seen problems in the past where the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
truck shows up on the job site then we

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.200 
truck shows up on the job site then we
take<00:03:01.840> our<00:03:02.080> can<00:03:02.830> of<00:03:02.980> color<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:03.580> we<00:03:03.730> climb<00:03:04.000> up

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
take our can of color and we climb up

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.940 
take our can of color and we climb up
and<00:03:04.360> put<00:03:04.840> it<00:03:04.960> in<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.110> back<00:03:05.260> of<00:03:05.380> the<00:03:05.440> truck<00:03:05.710> and

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
and put it in the back of the truck and

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.250 
and put it in the back of the truck and
perhaps<00:03:06.430> only<00:03:06.880> mixes<00:03:07.300> for<00:03:07.540> several<00:03:07.900> minutes

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
perhaps only mixes for several minutes

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.900 
perhaps only mixes for several minutes
and<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.980> client<00:03:09.310> wonders<00:03:09.610> why<00:03:09.730> you're

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
and the client wonders why you're

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.360 
and the client wonders why you're
getting<00:03:10.060> streaking<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:10.960> not<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> cohesive<00:03:11.800> mix

00:04:12.649 --> 00:04:12.659 
so what we want to do is make sure that

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.170 
so what we want to do is make sure that
we've<00:04:13.659> got<00:04:13.810> a<00:04:13.840> nice<00:04:14.019> even<00:04:14.439> plane<00:04:14.680> also<00:04:15.400> you

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:16.180 
we've got a nice even plane also you

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.390 
we've got a nice even plane also you
notice<00:04:16.479> on<00:04:16.630> our<00:04:16.660> adjoining<00:04:17.139> areas<00:04:17.709> we've

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
notice on our adjoining areas we've

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:20.069 
notice on our adjoining areas we've
covered<00:04:18.699> it<00:04:18.940> with<00:04:19.030> plastic<00:04:19.599> we<00:04:19.750> don't<00:04:19.900> want

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
covered it with plastic we don't want

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.749 
covered it with plastic we don't want
the<00:04:20.169> integral<00:04:20.590> colored<00:04:20.829> concrete<00:04:21.280> to

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
the integral colored concrete to

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.330 
the integral colored concrete to
contaminate<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.710> pre-existing<00:04:23.710> slabs<00:04:24.039> and

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
contaminate the pre-existing slabs and

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:27.360 
contaminate the pre-existing slabs and
one<00:04:24.970> way<00:04:25.120> that<00:04:25.300> works<00:04:25.479> well<00:04:25.780> is<00:04:26.050> to<00:04:26.620> drape<00:04:27.160> the

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
one way that works well is to drape the

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:29.339 
one way that works well is to drape the
plastic<00:04:27.820> over<00:04:28.030> the<00:04:28.210> existing<00:04:28.750> concrete<00:04:28.960> and

00:04:29.339 --> 00:04:29.349 
plastic over the existing concrete and

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:32.879 
plastic over the existing concrete and
then<00:04:30.039> nail<00:04:30.340> the<00:04:30.580> expansion<00:04:31.210> joint<00:04:31.889> encasing

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:32.889 
then nail the expansion joint encasing

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.219 
then nail the expansion joint encasing
or<00:04:33.009> locking<00:04:33.400> in<00:04:33.520> this<00:04:33.669> plastic<00:04:33.940> so<00:04:34.509> that<00:04:35.050> way

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
or locking in this plastic so that way

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:38.520 
or locking in this plastic so that way
you<00:04:35.289> don't<00:04:35.440> get<00:04:35.680> contaminants<00:04:37.410> staining<00:04:38.410> your

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
you don't get contaminants staining your

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:46.170 
you don't get contaminants staining your
existing<00:04:38.949> concrete<00:04:39.130> up<00:04:39.400> here
