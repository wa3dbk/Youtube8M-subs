00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
is and here's his heater blower that is

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.910 
is and here's his heater blower that is
the<00:01:31.890> blower<00:01:32.159> motor<00:01:32.490> it<00:01:32.869> heats<00:01:33.869> for<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.350> it

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
the blower motor it heats for the it

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.550 
the blower motor it heats for the it
blows<00:01:35.340> for<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> AC<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.750> for<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.110> heat<00:01:37.290> even

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
blows for the AC in for the heat even

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.499 
blows for the AC in for the heat even
they<00:01:37.680> call<00:01:37.890> it<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.070> heater<00:01:38.369> blitz<00:01:38.850> it's<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:40.940 
they call it a heater blitz it's the
blower<00:01:39.720> motor<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.110> does<00:01:40.229> everything<00:01:40.500> so

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
blower motor it does everything so

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.850 
blower motor it does everything so
basically<00:01:41.909> what<00:01:42.090> I'm<00:01:42.180> gonna<00:01:42.270> do<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.689> I'm<00:01:43.530> ago

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
car and turn the blower on and it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.060 
car and turn the blower on and it's
probably<00:01:49.110> not<00:01:49.259> going<00:01:49.439> to<00:01:49.500> work<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:49.829> then<00:01:49.950> I'm

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
probably not going to work and then I'm

going to come here and wiggle this
around<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.780> see<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.799> does<00:01:52.950> anything<00:01:53.250> in

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
around and see if that does anything in

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.510 
around and see if that does anything in
if<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.750> turns<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.259> on<00:01:55.380> then<00:01:55.649> we're<00:01:56.280> going<00:01:56.460> to

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
if it turns it on then we're going to

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.130 
if it turns it on then we're going to
know<00:01:56.670> this<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.119> the<00:01:57.270> source<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.719> problem

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
know this is the source of the problem

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.639 
know this is the source of the problem
now<00:01:58.710> if<00:01:59.399> we<00:01:59.790> swap<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.719> one<00:02:00.899> with<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> good

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
now if we swap out this one with a good

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:02.030 
now if we swap out this one with a good
one

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
one

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.410 
one
if<00:02:02.100> you<00:02:02.310> have<00:02:02.460> access<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.000> parts<00:02:03.240> like<00:02:03.390> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
if you have access to parts like that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.020 
if you have access to parts like that
then<00:02:03.810> we'd<00:02:04.469> also<00:02:04.680> know<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.369> would<00:02:05.520> be<00:02:05.549> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
then we'd also know that would be the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.620 
then we'd also know that would be the
relay<00:02:06.299> that<00:02:06.479> would<00:02:06.600> be<00:02:06.659> another<00:02:06.899> reason

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:07.630 
relay that would be another reason

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.719 
relay that would be another reason
to<00:02:07.869> have<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> replace<00:02:08.500> the<00:02:08.619> relay<00:02:08.920> if<00:02:09.310> you've

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
to have to replace the relay if you've

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.059 
to have to replace the relay if you've
done<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.179> and<00:02:10.450> you've<00:02:10.530> tried<00:02:11.530> the<00:02:11.770> relay

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
done this and you've tried the relay

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:13.890 
done this and you've tried the relay
chances<00:02:12.849> are<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.180> going<00:02:13.330> to<00:02:13.390> be<00:02:13.480> your<00:02:13.599> blower

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
chances are it's going to be your blower

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.320 
chances are it's going to be your blower
motor<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.590> those<00:02:14.830> go<00:02:15.040> bad<00:02:15.280> after<00:02:15.550> a<00:02:15.730> while<00:02:15.940> so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
motor that those go bad after a while so

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.479 
motor that those go bad after a while so
you<00:02:17.019> would<00:02:17.260> then<00:02:17.680> need<00:02:17.739> to<00:02:17.950> go<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.220> replace

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
you would then need to go and replace

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.400 
you would then need to go and replace
your<00:02:18.610> blower<00:02:18.819> motor<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.690> now<00:02:19.810> I'm<00:02:20.050> like<00:02:20.380> I

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
your blower motor but now I'm like I

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:21.690 
your blower motor but now I'm like I
said<00:02:20.560> I'm<00:02:20.739> go<00:02:20.800> ahead<00:02:21.099> and<00:02:21.190> start<00:02:21.370> up<00:02:21.459> the<00:02:21.550> car

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
clip or an insulated wire almost like

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.370 
clip or an insulated wire almost like
the<00:03:51.980> tie<00:03:52.980> thing<00:03:53.040> is<00:03:53.459> you<00:03:53.580> get<00:03:53.700> there<00:03:53.880> at<00:03:53.970> the

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.810 
the tie thing is you get there at the
supermarket<00:03:55.380> those<00:03:55.800> are<00:03:55.950> insulated<00:03:56.490> and<00:03:56.670> it's

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
supermarket those are insulated and it's

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.820 
supermarket those are insulated and it's
a<00:03:56.880> wire<00:03:57.090> you<00:03:57.840> you<00:03:58.110> should<00:03:58.290> be<00:03:58.380> able<00:03:58.440> take<00:03:58.590> one

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
a wire you you should be able take one

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.710 
a wire you you should be able take one
of<00:03:58.950> those<00:03:59.070> and<00:03:59.400> we're<00:03:59.880> gonna<00:03:59.970> look<00:04:00.270> at<00:04:00.510> the

of those and we're gonna look at the

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.140 
of those and we're gonna look at the
circuit<00:04:01.440> we've<00:04:01.560> got<00:04:01.770> going<00:04:01.980> on<00:04:02.160> here<00:04:02.370> we<00:04:02.970> can

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
circuit we've got going on here we can

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.380 
circuit we've got going on here we can
see<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:03.660> when<00:04:04.500> this<00:04:05.310> side<00:04:05.610> is<00:04:05.820> energized

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
see that when this side is energized

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.229 
see that when this side is energized
we've<00:04:07.080> got<00:04:07.319> this<00:04:07.830> guy<00:04:08.040> right<00:04:08.280> here<00:04:08.310> it's<00:04:09.120> gonna

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
we've got this guy right here it's gonna

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.300 
we've got this guy right here it's gonna
pull<00:04:09.780> our<00:04:10.050> little<00:04:10.290> circuit<00:04:10.860> here<00:04:11.070> it's<00:04:11.220> going

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:11.310 
pull our little circuit here it's going

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:13.280 
pull our little circuit here it's going
to<00:04:11.370> complete<00:04:11.730> the<00:04:11.880> circuit<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.450> we<00:04:12.690> need<00:04:13.200> to

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
to complete the circuit so we need to

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:17.090 
to complete the circuit so we need to
look<00:04:13.440> for<00:04:13.739> is<00:04:14.270> 3287<00:04:15.270> and<00:04:15.840> we<00:04:16.470> can<00:04:16.650> take<00:04:16.890> that

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
look for is 3287 and we can take that

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.880 
look for is 3287 and we can take that
wire<00:04:17.370> outside<00:04:17.579> about<00:04:18.030> and<00:04:18.239> put<00:04:18.390> it<00:04:18.540> at<00:04:18.930> 30<00:04:19.590> and

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:19.890 
wire outside about and put it at 30 and

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.420 
wire outside about and put it at 30 and
87<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.850> two<00:04:21.000> terminals<00:04:21.450> and<00:04:21.930> we<00:04:22.109> can<00:04:22.320> jump<00:04:22.919> the

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
87 the two terminals and we can jump the

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.170 
87 the two terminals and we can jump the
thing<00:04:23.700> there<00:04:23.880> so<00:04:24.260> what<00:04:25.260> we<00:04:25.410> can<00:04:25.530> do<00:04:25.710> is<00:04:25.919> if<00:04:26.400> we

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
thing there so what we can do is if we

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.080 
thing there so what we can do is if we
jump<00:04:27.510> it<00:04:27.690> then<00:04:28.410> we'll<00:04:29.040> know<00:04:29.280> if<00:04:29.640> it<00:04:29.760> works<00:04:29.970> or

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
jump it then we'll know if it works or

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.510 
jump it then we'll know if it works or
not<00:04:30.150> because<00:04:30.540> it<00:04:30.810> it'll<00:04:31.230> come<00:04:31.470> on<00:04:31.740> if<00:04:32.280> the

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
not because it it'll come on if the

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:34.130 
not because it it'll come on if the
blower<00:04:32.669> motor<00:04:33.000> is<00:04:33.120> actually<00:04:33.480> working<00:04:33.690> if<00:04:33.990> you

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:34.140 
blower motor is actually working if you

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.560 
blower motor is actually working if you
jump<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.800> circuit<00:04:35.160> there<00:04:35.310> so<00:04:35.580> we'll<00:04:36.150> look<00:04:36.300> on

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
jump the circuit there so we'll look on

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.130 
jump the circuit there so we'll look on
the<00:04:36.720> back<00:04:36.930> here<00:04:37.320> and<00:04:37.470> we'll<00:04:37.919> look<00:04:38.070> for<00:04:38.340> 30<00:04:38.760> and

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
the back here and we'll look for 30 and

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.270 
the back here and we'll look for 30 and
87<00:04:40.140> so<00:04:40.650> 30<00:04:41.220> is<00:04:41.669> right<00:04:42.150> there<00:04:42.510> and<00:04:42.810> 87<00:04:43.770> is<00:04:43.950> right

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
87 so 30 is right there and 87 is right

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.810 
87 so 30 is right there and 87 is right
here<00:04:44.790> okay<00:04:45.330> second<00:04:45.900> 30<00:04:46.470> is<00:04:46.680> right<00:04:46.950> here<00:04:47.190> 87<00:04:47.729> is

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
here okay second 30 is right here 87 is

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.480 
here okay second 30 is right here 87 is
right<00:04:48.000> here<00:04:48.210> so<00:04:48.660> what<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.960> would<00:04:49.080> do<00:04:49.290> is<00:04:49.740> you

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
right here so what you would do is you

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.330 
right here so what you would do is you
would<00:04:50.520> jump<00:04:50.850> here<00:04:51.300> to<00:04:51.960> here<00:04:52.290> so<00:04:52.320> you<00:04:52.860> jump<00:04:53.130> here

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
would jump here to here so you jump here

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.920 
would jump here to here so you jump here
to<00:04:53.430> here<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.580> take<00:04:53.910> your<00:04:53.970> little<00:04:54.419> your

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
to here you take your little your

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.050 
to here you take your little your
insulated<00:04:55.380> wire<00:04:55.710> and<00:04:56.040> you'd<00:04:56.550> stick<00:04:56.790> it<00:04:56.910> from

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:57.060 
insulated wire and you'd stick it from

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:58.850 
insulated wire and you'd stick it from
there<00:04:57.240> to<00:04:57.540> there<00:04:57.720> with<00:04:58.290> the<00:04:58.380> car<00:04:58.590> in<00:04:58.650> the<00:04:58.740> on

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
there to there with the car in the on

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.640 
there to there with the car in the on
position<00:04:58.890> and<00:04:59.700> if<00:05:00.240> your<00:05:00.750> blower<00:05:01.020> motor<00:05:01.260> starts

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
position and if your blower motor starts

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.110 
position and if your blower motor starts
up<00:05:01.830> then<00:05:02.250> that's<00:05:02.370> going<00:05:02.550> to<00:05:02.610> indicate<00:05:02.790> that

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
up then that's going to indicate that

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.430 
up then that's going to indicate that
this<00:05:03.570> relay<00:05:04.229> here<00:05:04.500> is<00:05:04.590> not<00:05:04.770> doing<00:05:05.040> its<00:05:05.160> job<00:05:05.550> so

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
this relay here is not doing its job so

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:10.909 
this relay here is not doing its job so
that's<00:05:07.440> that's<00:05:08.040> a<00:05:08.360> good<00:05:09.360> thing<00:05:09.600> if<00:05:09.900> if<00:05:10.410> it's

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:10.919 
that's that's a good thing if if it's

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:12.500 
that's that's a good thing if if it's
the<00:05:11.070> bad<00:05:11.250> relay<00:05:11.610> because<00:05:11.820> you'd<00:05:11.970> rather<00:05:12.060> chain

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:12.510 
the bad relay because you'd rather chain

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.170 
the bad relay because you'd rather chain
to<00:05:12.630> relay<00:05:12.930> than<00:05:13.350> a<00:05:13.380> blower<00:05:13.710> motor<00:05:14.040> so<00:05:14.669> that's

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
to relay than a blower motor so that's

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.450 
to relay than a blower motor so that's
how<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.419> determine<00:05:15.750> if<00:05:16.290> it<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.770> relay<00:05:17.220> for

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
how you determine if it is the relay for

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.730 
how you determine if it is the relay for
your<00:05:17.550> blower<00:05:17.760> motor<00:05:17.970> also<00:05:18.870> guys<00:05:19.200> one<00:05:19.530> more

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:19.740 
your blower motor also guys one more

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:20.900 
your blower motor also guys one more
thing<00:05:19.950> you<00:05:20.010> want<00:05:20.160> to<00:05:20.220> make<00:05:20.340> sure<00:05:20.370> of<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:20.880> that

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:20.910 
thing you want to make sure of is that

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.170 
thing you want to make sure of is that
your<00:05:21.810> new<00:05:22.140> relay<00:05:22.560> is<00:05:22.770> going<00:05:23.280> in<00:05:23.460> the<00:05:23.640> right<00:05:23.910> way

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
your new relay is going in the right way

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.659 
your new relay is going in the right way
you<00:05:24.479> can<00:05:24.960> take<00:05:25.380> your<00:05:25.500> old<00:05:25.680> relay<00:05:26.130> out<00:05:26.340> in

00:05:26.659 --> 00:05:26.669 
you can take your old relay out in

00:05:26.669 --> 00:05:29.840 
you can take your old relay out in
although<00:05:27.830> your<00:05:28.830> old<00:05:29.039> relay<00:05:29.430> may<00:05:29.640> have<00:05:29.820> a

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:29.850 
although your old relay may have a

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:32.570 
although your old relay may have a
picture<00:05:30.150> on<00:05:30.360> one<00:05:30.750> side<00:05:30.990> your<00:05:31.680> new<00:05:31.950> relay<00:05:32.340> can

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
picture on one side your new relay can

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.270 
picture on one side your new relay can
have<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.150> picture<00:05:33.630> on<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:34.350> other<00:05:34.560> side<00:05:34.979> and

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
have the picture on the other side and

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.560 
have the picture on the other side and
that<00:05:35.340> was<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.789> case<00:05:36.000> for<00:05:36.030> this<00:05:36.330> particular

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:36.570 
that was the case for this particular

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:39.980 
that was the case for this particular
car<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.830> just<00:05:37.860> make<00:05:38.220> sure<00:05:38.250> that<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:39.390> circuitry

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
car so just make sure that the circuitry

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.070 
car so just make sure that the circuitry
actually<00:05:40.530> matches<00:05:41.070> up<00:05:41.310> with<00:05:42.030> the<00:05:42.510> old<00:05:42.690> relay

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
actually matches up with the old relay

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.890 
actually matches up with the old relay
and<00:05:43.350> put<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:43.740> on<00:05:43.860> that<00:05:44.340> way<00:05:44.580> if<00:05:44.820> not<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.720> could

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
and put it on that way if not you could

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.020 
and put it on that way if not you could
still<00:05:46.140> put<00:05:46.320> it<00:05:46.410> on<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.680> wrong<00:05:46.830> way<00:05:47.070> so<00:05:47.760> that

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
still put it on the wrong way so that

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.670 
still put it on the wrong way so that
pretty<00:05:48.240> much<00:05:48.360> sums<00:05:48.690> up<00:05:48.840> today's<00:05:49.110> video<00:05:49.470> I

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
pretty much sums up today's video I

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.360 
pretty much sums up today's video I
