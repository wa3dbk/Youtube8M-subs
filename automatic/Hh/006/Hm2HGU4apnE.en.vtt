really like how this is set up the only

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.539 
really like how this is set up the only

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
flaw like I said before the only flaw of

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.730 
flaw like I said before the only flaw of
this<00:01:50.790> film<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.329> this<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.540> just<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:51.960> alright<00:01:52.290> if

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
this film and this is just me alright if

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.170 
this film and this is just me alright if
you<00:01:52.920> think<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.430> okay<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:53.970> film

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180

that's<00:01:54.509> awesome<00:01:55.020> but<00:01:55.200> for<00:01:55.350> me<00:01:55.500> I<00:01:55.740> think<00:01:56.100> it

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
that's awesome but for me I think it

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.800 
that's awesome but for me I think it
would<00:01:56.579> have<00:01:56.670> been<00:01:56.700> better<00:01:56.939> off<00:01:57.060> to<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.570> like<00:01:57.780> a

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
would have been better off to be like a

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.679 
would have been better off to be like a
more<00:01:58.110> serious<00:01:58.219> action<00:01:59.219> movie<00:01:59.579> as<00:01:59.729> opposed<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
more serious action movie as opposed to

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.139 
more serious action movie as opposed to
a<00:02:00.869> comedy<00:02:01.409> with<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:01.890> mixture<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.399> action<00:02:02.909> thrown

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149
