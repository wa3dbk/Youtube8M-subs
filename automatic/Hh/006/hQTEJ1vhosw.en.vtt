00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.520 

ok<00:03:34.880> so<00:03:34.940> my<00:03:35.180> laziness<00:03:35.690> sort<00:03:35.930> of<00:03:36.020> didn't<00:03:36.380> work

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
ok so my laziness sort of didn't work

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:38.080 
ok so my laziness sort of didn't work
and<00:03:36.770> I<00:03:36.800> had<00:03:36.920> to<00:03:37.069> run<00:03:37.190> into<00:03:37.459> the<00:03:37.550> bathroom<00:03:37.700> to

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
and I had to run into the bathroom to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.589 
and I had to run into the bathroom to
quickly<00:03:38.680> heat<00:03:39.680> up<00:03:39.950> that<00:03:40.280> particular<00:03:41.150> part<00:03:41.330> of

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:41.599 
quickly heat up that particular part of

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:44.530 
quickly heat up that particular part of
a<00:03:41.989> little<00:03:42.770> hand<00:03:43.580> thing<00:03:43.910> keeps<00:03:44.180> falling<00:03:44.510> down

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
a little hand thing keeps falling down

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.140 
a little hand thing keeps falling down
but<00:03:45.170> basically<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.950> just<00:03:46.370> had<00:03:46.550> to<00:03:46.580> use<00:03:46.880> a<00:03:46.910> blow

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
but basically I just had to use a blow

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.530 
but basically I just had to use a blow
dryer<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.780> just<00:03:48.140> like<00:03:48.380> keep<00:03:48.950> um<00:03:49.250> blue<00:03:50.209> during

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
dryer and just like keep um blue during

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.690 
dryer and just like keep um blue during
that<00:03:50.720> particular<00:03:50.959> plastic<00:03:51.800> area<00:03:52.130> but

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
that particular plastic area but

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.340 
that particular plastic area but
basically<00:03:53.180> this<00:03:53.420> is<00:03:53.480> what<00:03:53.750> it<00:03:53.870> looks<00:03:54.050> like<00:03:54.200> in

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
basically this is what it looks like in

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.740 
basically this is what it looks like in
the<00:03:54.470> end<00:03:54.650> it's<00:03:55.040> really<00:03:55.700> really<00:03:55.940> tight<00:03:56.270> on<00:03:56.300> to

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
the end it's really really tight on to

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.720 
the end it's really really tight on to
the<00:03:57.200> heel<00:03:57.500> of<00:03:57.530> my<00:03:57.680> shoe<00:03:57.830> and<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.430> sort<00:03:58.670> of

the heel of my shoe and it sort of

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.000 
the heel of my shoe and it sort of
doesn't<00:03:58.940> look<00:03:59.209> that<00:03:59.239> bad<00:03:59.569> because<00:03:59.930> um<00:04:00.470> you

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.240 
though I guess is that don't use it on
suede<00:04:38.990> shoes<00:04:39.350> I<00:04:39.530> just<00:04:39.800> tried<00:04:40.010> it<00:04:40.039> for<00:04:40.190> the

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
suede shoes I just tried it for the

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.950 
suede shoes I just tried it for the
first<00:04:40.310> time<00:04:40.580> on<00:04:40.880> these<00:04:41.000> particular<00:04:41.210> material

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:41.960 
first time on these particular material

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.250 
first time on these particular material
of<00:04:42.050> shoes<00:04:42.289> and<00:04:42.560> this<00:04:43.070> is<00:04:43.220> like<00:04:43.370> suede<00:04:43.729> so<00:04:44.260> if

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
of shoes and this is like suede so if

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.380 
of shoes and this is like suede so if
you<00:04:45.410> put<00:04:45.590> it<00:04:45.740> on<00:04:45.890> this<00:04:46.220> it<00:04:46.550> sort<00:04:46.880> of<00:04:46.940> looks<00:04:47.240> like

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:47.390 
you put it on this it sort of looks like

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.240 
you put it on this it sort of looks like
there's<00:04:47.720> a<00:04:47.750> big<00:04:47.930> color<00:04:48.140> difference<00:04:48.590> whereas<00:04:49.160> I

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
there's a big color difference whereas I

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:50.890 
there's a big color difference whereas I
think<00:04:49.460> if<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.700> put<00:04:49.850> it<00:04:49.970> on<00:04:50.120> like<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.330> patent

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
think if you put it on like a patent

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.510 
think if you put it on like a patent
pair<00:04:51.080> of<00:04:51.169> shoes<00:04:51.380> like<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.590> rather<00:04:51.860> shiny<00:04:52.250> for

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
pair of shoes like a rather shiny for

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.850 
pair of shoes like a rather shiny for
her<00:04:52.580> shoes<00:04:52.880> it<00:04:53.390> won't<00:04:53.600> be<00:04:53.720> as<00:04:53.810> noticeable<00:04:53.990> so<00:04:54.620> I

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
her shoes it won't be as noticeable so I

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.590 
her shoes it won't be as noticeable so I
guess<00:04:55.250> that's<00:04:55.490> just<00:04:55.580> one<00:04:55.910> thing<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.240> be<00:04:56.510> aware

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
guess that's just one thing to be aware

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.810 
guess that's just one thing to be aware
of<00:04:56.780> I<00:04:57.470> really<00:04:57.860> like<00:04:58.010> these<00:04:58.160> pair<00:04:58.370> of<00:04:58.430> shoes<00:04:58.640> oh

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:58.820 
of I really like these pair of shoes oh

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:00.460 
of I really like these pair of shoes oh
so<00:04:59.419> that's<00:04:59.660> why<00:04:59.780> I<00:04:59.810> wanted<00:05:00.110> to<00:05:00.169> put<00:05:00.380> the

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
so that's why I wanted to put the

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:02.140 
so that's why I wanted to put the
protection<00:05:00.950> on<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.130> I<00:05:01.370> didn't<00:05:01.669> want<00:05:01.760> it<00:05:01.910> to<00:05:01.940> get

into I'm this particular product but you
didn't<00:05:10.160> want<00:05:10.490> to<00:05:10.640> purchase<00:05:10.850> this<00:05:11.150> product

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
didn't want to purchase this product

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.900 
didn't want to purchase this product
whether<00:05:12.680> it<00:05:12.890> was<00:05:13.010> too<00:05:13.160> expensive<00:05:13.250> or<00:05:13.820> it

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:13.910 
whether it was too expensive or it

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.140 
whether it was too expensive or it
wasn't<00:05:14.060> available<00:05:14.419> to<00:05:14.840> you<00:05:15.669> then<00:05:16.669> you<00:05:16.940> could

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
wasn't available to you then you could

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.140 
wasn't available to you then you could
always<00:05:17.270> try<00:05:17.630> like<00:05:17.810> just<00:05:18.050> tape<00:05:18.350> I<00:05:18.760> guess<00:05:19.760> a

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
always try like just tape I guess a

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.029 
always try like just tape I guess a
double<00:05:20.750> sided<00:05:20.930> tape<00:05:21.050> would<00:05:21.350> work<00:05:21.590> but<00:05:21.860> you

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:22.039 
double sided tape would work but you

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:24.400 
double sided tape would work but you
would<00:05:22.160> really<00:05:22.520> have<00:05:22.669> to<00:05:22.760> press<00:05:23.000> up<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.960> area

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:24.410 
would really have to press up the area

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:27.580 
would really have to press up the area
so<00:05:24.919> that<00:05:25.090> it<00:05:26.090> wouldn't<00:05:26.390> stick<00:05:26.690> onto<00:05:26.900> anything

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:27.590 
so that it wouldn't stick onto anything

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.290 
so that it wouldn't stick onto anything
else<00:05:28.100> otherwise<00:05:28.610> that<00:05:28.880> would<00:05:28.940> look<00:05:29.150> rather

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
else otherwise that would look rather

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:30.760 
else otherwise that would look rather
dirty<00:05:29.660> but<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:29.990> guess<00:05:30.169> you<00:05:30.289> could<00:05:30.320> just<00:05:30.530> always

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:30.770 
dirty but I guess you could just always

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:34.210 
dirty but I guess you could just always
change<00:05:31.160> it<00:05:31.960> apart<00:05:32.960> from<00:05:33.080> that<00:05:33.110> I<00:05:33.590> actually

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:34.220 
change it apart from that I actually

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.270
