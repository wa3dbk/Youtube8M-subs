00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.520
 Guys, what 's happening here now? 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.790

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.890
 initial brief is all the people here at 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.500
 door of the place where you will be 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.860
 official meeting of the rally where the 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:19.350
 organizers explain how the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:20.670
 rally talking a little about the sx 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.729
 letter in development what people 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 always counts but what is sx what he 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.150
 has a positive characteristic for 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
 to face the score like this is one 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.710
 competition car is always in 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.229
 development in the 1st sx in a more 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.850
 specific is a car I still have a lot 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.350
 little time of use is debuted in morocco 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.500
 2012 I think the big strong point in the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.450
 car is the suspension geometry and in the 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 center of gravity of the car very muddy 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.289
 a very well prepared car very well 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.929
 developed 

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.969
 nothing less for what you understand 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.070
 car that is what riches has won 11 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.860
 Sometimes I think it happens that 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.439
 We made it there in the bay we'll be able to 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.159
 use enough here now does not give in here 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.159
 make a good test 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.900
 what you already have the information you 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.230
 already knew from the first day the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.160
 first day that is well enclosed is one more 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.800
 or less what we already know 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.300
 who we have a rally of the backlands that 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.890
 This is where we are going to walk. 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.820
 region of code here, but rather a 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:31.920
 special road but try curve is 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.890
 quite script navigation this year 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.100
 rally starts on the roads one 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.630
 more favorable to 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.350
 Brazilians because that's what we are 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.350
 accustomed to walking there 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.540
 tomorrow the business is not to let 

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:59.040
 anxiety take over taking a test 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.019
 sure we'll leave it behind 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.680
 so we have to give more 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:03.680
 feeling 

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400
 ae
