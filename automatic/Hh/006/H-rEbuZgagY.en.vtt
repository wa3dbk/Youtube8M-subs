click<00:03:27.690> on<00:03:27.870> and<00:03:28.200> you'll<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.770> back<00:03:28.950> to<00:03:29.160> the

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
click on and you'll get back to the

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.390 
click on and you'll get back to the
return<00:03:30.320> now<00:03:31.320> each<00:03:31.500> of<00:03:31.530> these<00:03:31.770> comes<00:03:32.130> with<00:03:32.310> the

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
return now each of these comes with the

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.430 
return now each of these comes with the
base<00:03:32.580> to<00:03:32.850> push<00:03:33.060> it<00:03:33.209> on<00:03:33.390> and<00:03:33.630> you<00:03:33.720> simply<00:03:34.140> fold

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440 
base to push it on and you simply fold

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.440 
base to push it on and you simply fold
this<00:03:34.680> in<00:03:34.890> half<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.459> then<00:03:35.550> put<00:03:35.580> the<00:03:35.880> mechanism

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450 
this in half and then put the mechanism

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.440 
this in half and then put the mechanism
in<00:03:36.630> the<00:03:36.870> middle<00:03:37.170> and<00:03:37.489> then<00:03:38.489> put<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.910> object<00:03:39.239> on

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
in the middle and then put the object on

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.640 
in the middle and then put the object on
top<00:03:39.720> again

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
top again

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.890 
top again
that's<00:03:40.890> text<00:03:41.310> editable<00:03:41.790> and<00:03:42.000> you<00:03:42.480> can<00:03:42.660> write

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
that's text editable and you can write

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.720 
that's text editable and you can write
into<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.380> or<00:03:43.560> delete<00:03:43.980> it<00:03:44.160> if<00:03:44.250> you<00:03:44.400> want<00:03:44.580> to

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
into that or delete it if you want to

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.070 
into that or delete it if you want to
and<00:03:44.850> just<00:03:44.880> will<00:03:45.180> hand<00:03:45.450> write<00:03:45.720> a<00:03:45.750> message

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
and just will hand write a message

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.680 
and just will hand write a message
either<00:03:46.860> on<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.220> object<00:03:47.610> itself<00:03:47.790> or<00:03:48.330> pop

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
either on the object itself or pop

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.530 
either on the object itself or pop
something<00:03:49.230> in<00:03:49.350> there<00:03:49.590> and<00:03:49.910> then<00:03:50.910> last<00:03:51.330> but<00:03:51.450> not

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
something in there and then last but not

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.630 
something in there and then last but not
least<00:03:51.870> each<00:03:52.200> and<00:03:52.530> come<00:03:52.770> to<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.040> mechanism

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
least each and come to the mechanism

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.790 
least each and come to the mechanism
because<00:03:53.850> you've<00:03:54.150> got<00:03:54.300> two<00:03:54.600> variations<00:03:55.170> here

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:55.800 
because you've got two variations here

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:59.060 
because you've got two variations here
I've<00:03:56.160> popped<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.090> two<00:03:57.420> mechanisms<00:03:57.920> onto<00:03:58.920> one

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
I've popped the two mechanisms onto one

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.530 
I've popped the two mechanisms onto one
piece<00:03:59.340> of<00:03:59.520> paper<00:03:59.670> that<00:03:59.970> just<00:04:00.180> saves<00:04:00.390> you<00:04:00.480> a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
piece of paper that just saves you a

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.060 
piece of paper that just saves you a
little<00:04:00.750> bit<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.020> printing<00:04:01.470> but<00:04:01.950> they're

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.070 
little bit of printing but they're

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:04.040 
little bit of printing but they're
identical<00:04:02.610> it<00:04:02.850> doesn't<00:04:03.150> matter<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.810> they

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
identical it doesn't matter and they

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.600 
identical it doesn't matter and they
come<00:04:04.260> in<00:04:04.410> pairs<00:04:04.650> here<00:04:05.040> they<00:04:05.190> come<00:04:05.400> like<00:04:05.580> a

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 
come in pairs here they come like a

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:09.500 
come in pairs here they come like a
mirrored<00:04:06.030> pair<00:04:07.340> simply<00:04:08.340> print<00:04:08.610> nests<00:04:08.790> out<00:04:08.970> cut

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
mirrored pair simply print nests out cut

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.270 
mirrored pair simply print nests out cut
it<00:04:09.540> out<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.140> fold<00:04:10.320> along<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.680> dotted<00:04:11.010> lines

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
it out and fold along the dotted lines

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.699 
it out and fold along the dotted lines
all<00:04:11.880> the<00:04:11.940> instructions<00:04:12.750> are<00:04:12.989> on<00:04:13.019> both<00:04:13.440> the

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
all the instructions are on both the

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.130 
all the instructions are on both the
written<00:04:14.010> tutorial<00:04:14.730> and<00:04:15.060> the<00:04:15.450> video<00:04:15.690> one<00:04:15.959> as

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:16.140 
written tutorial and the video one as

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
written tutorial and the video one as
well<00:04:17.630> so<00:04:18.630> if<00:04:18.720> I<00:04:18.840> come<00:04:19.109> back<00:04:19.260> now<00:04:19.500> we<00:04:19.560> can<00:04:19.890> see

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
well so if I come back now we can see

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.940 
well so if I come back now we can see
what<00:04:20.459> we've<00:04:20.640> got<00:04:20.669> as<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.780> range<00:04:22.260> of<00:04:22.500> various

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
what we've got as a range of various

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.190 
what we've got as a range of various
images<00:04:23.400> here<00:04:23.640> for<00:04:23.880> both<00:04:24.030> boys<00:04:24.300> and<00:04:24.360> girls<00:04:24.660> even

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
images here for both boys and girls even

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.140 
images here for both boys and girls even
for<00:04:25.590> I<00:04:25.650> would<00:04:25.890> say<00:04:25.919> we've<00:04:26.250> got<00:04:26.400> our<00:04:26.520> teenagers

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
for I would say we've got our teenagers

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.740 
for I would say we've got our teenagers
covered<00:04:27.510> here

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
covered here

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.470 
covered here
as<00:04:27.870> well<00:04:28.140> so<00:04:28.950> let's<00:04:29.190> say<00:04:29.400> we've<00:04:29.610> got<00:04:29.640> a<00:04:30.150> young

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
as well so let's say we've got a young

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.850 
as well so let's say we've got a young
perhaps<00:04:30.900> a<00:04:31.080> young<00:04:31.260> boy<00:04:31.470> you've<00:04:31.680> got<00:04:31.710> a

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
perhaps a young boy you've got a

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.010 
perhaps a young boy you've got a
fantastic<00:04:32.240> double<00:04:33.240> one<00:04:33.450> here

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.020 
fantastic double one here

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:36.170 
fantastic double one here
now<00:04:34.710> all<00:04:34.890> these<00:04:35.070> pop<00:04:35.340> ups<00:04:35.580> work<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.000> what's

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
now all these pop ups work on what's

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.440 
now all these pop ups work on what's
called<00:04:36.360> the<00:04:36.570> floating<00:04:36.950> layer<00:04:38.240> section<00:04:39.240> and

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.450 
called the floating layer section and

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.660 
called the floating layer section and
that<00:04:39.600> means<00:04:39.840> is<00:04:40.050> you<00:04:40.170> open<00:04:40.290> up<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.680> card<00:04:40.950> the

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
that means is you open up the card the

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.900 
that means is you open up the card the
layer<00:04:42.270> appears<00:04:42.840> the<00:04:43.620> pot<00:04:43.860> pops<00:04:44.250> up<00:04:44.460> out<00:04:44.610> of<00:04:44.670> the

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
layer appears the pot pops up out of the

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.880 
layer appears the pot pops up out of the
page<00:04:45.120> it<00:04:45.330> rises<00:04:45.990> up<00:04:46.140> out<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:46.620> page<00:04:46.860> and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:46.890 
page it rises up out of the page and

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.710 
page it rises up out of the page and
sits<00:04:47.340> above<00:04:47.640> it<00:04:47.820> it's<00:04:48.390> a<00:04:48.450> very<00:04:48.600> simple

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
sits above it it's a very simple

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.010 
sits above it it's a very simple
mechanism<00:04:49.640> really<00:04:50.640> really<00:04:50.970> effective<00:04:51.600> and

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
mechanism really really effective and

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870 
mechanism really really effective and
I've<00:04:52.140> chosen<00:04:52.380> this<00:04:52.740> because<00:04:53.190> I<00:04:53.220> think<00:04:53.370> young

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
I've chosen this because I think young

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.940 
I've chosen this because I think young
kids<00:04:54.180> will<00:04:54.420> be<00:04:54.540> able<00:04:54.690> to<00:04:54.930> make<00:04:55.110> a<00:04:55.140> really<00:04:55.740> good

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
kids will be able to make a really good

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.240 
kids will be able to make a really good
card<00:04:56.220> without<00:04:57.030> any<00:04:57.450> trouble<00:04:58.140> at<00:04:58.260> all<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.770> have

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
card without any trouble at all and have

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.090 
card without any trouble at all and have
all<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.640> surprise<00:05:00.570> and<00:05:01.290> fun<00:05:01.560> and<00:05:01.740> excitement

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
all the surprise and fun and excitement

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.670 
all the surprise and fun and excitement
of<00:05:02.400> the<00:05:02.550> pop-up<00:05:02.940> as<00:05:03.150> well<00:05:03.450> now<00:05:04.200> this<00:05:04.440> one's

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
of the pop-up as well now this one's

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.409 
of the pop-up as well now this one's
really<00:05:05.010> lovely<00:05:05.430> because<00:05:05.730> not<00:05:05.880> only<00:05:05.910> just<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.409 --> 00:05:06.419 
really lovely because not only just the

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:09.110 
really lovely because not only just the
castle<00:05:07.050> here<00:05:07.440> I<00:05:07.650> click<00:05:07.980> onto<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.490> that<00:05:08.880> will

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
castle here I click onto it that will

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.390 
castle here I click onto it that will
pop<00:05:09.360> up<00:05:09.390> out<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.810> the<00:05:10.050> page<00:05:10.290> but<00:05:10.860> then<00:05:11.070> we<00:05:11.220> put

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
pop up out of the page but then we put

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.090 
pop up out of the page but then we put
the<00:05:11.580> knight<00:05:11.910> on<00:05:11.940> top<00:05:12.510> of<00:05:12.720> that<00:05:12.930> and<00:05:13.470> he<00:05:13.680> rises

the knight on top of that and he rises
up<00:05:14.130> even<00:05:14.640> further<00:05:14.880> so<00:05:15.419> you<00:05:15.480> get<00:05:15.660> a<00:05:15.690> really

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
up even further so you get a really

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.040 
up even further so you get a really
dynamic<00:05:17.010> card<00:05:17.640> and<00:05:18.030> you've<00:05:18.240> got<00:05:18.419> the<00:05:18.570> base<00:05:18.750> on
