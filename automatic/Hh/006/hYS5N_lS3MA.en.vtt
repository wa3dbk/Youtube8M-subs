though cuz I'm fairly over level um who
is<00:05:39.030> higher<00:05:39.270> speed<00:05:39.690> though<00:05:40.250> speed<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.370> 57

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
is higher speed though speed is 57

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.100 
is higher speed though speed is 57
oops<00:05:45.190> speed<00:05:46.190> is<00:05:46.310> 38<00:05:46.640> all<00:05:46.790> right<00:05:46.940> um<00:05:47.720> because

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110 
oops speed is 38 all right um because

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.420 
oops speed is 38 all right um because
when<00:05:48.440> you<00:05:48.530> run<00:05:48.710> away<00:05:48.830> it<00:05:49.040> depends<00:05:49.340> on<00:05:49.370> the
