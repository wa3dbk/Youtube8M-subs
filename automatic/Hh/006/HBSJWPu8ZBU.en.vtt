entrusting us with his brand new monitor
that<00:00:16.500> is<00:00:17.210> probably<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.300> best<00:00:18.480> monitor<00:00:18.960> I've

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
that is probably the best monitor I've

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.670 
that is probably the best monitor I've
ever<00:00:19.289> even<00:00:19.470> looked<00:00:19.859> at<00:00:21.020> super<00:00:22.020> high<00:00:22.050> contrast

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
ever even looked at super high contrast

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.300 
ever even looked at super high contrast
ratio<00:00:22.800> I<00:00:23.550> love<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.359> way<00:00:24.480> it<00:00:24.600> looks<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:25.140> mean<00:00:25.310> the

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
ratio I love the way it looks I mean the

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.189 
ratio I love the way it looks I mean the
stand<00:00:26.760> could<00:00:27.150> be<00:00:27.300> better<00:00:27.480> just<00:00:27.840> because<00:00:27.930> I

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
stand could be better just because I

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.589 
stand could be better just because I
don't<00:00:28.260> know<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.529> feels<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.920> little<00:00:29.330> iffy<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> me

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
don't know it feels a little iffy to me

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.040 
don't know it feels a little iffy to me
but<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.050> definitely<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.880> design<00:00:32.880> statement<00:00:33.630> I

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but it's definitely a design statement I

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.780 
but it's definitely a design statement I
would<00:00:34.260> say<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.770> is<00:00:34.920> though<00:00:35.250> something<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
would say that is though something you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.670 
would say that is though something you
haven't<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.420> know<00:00:36.540> out<00:00:36.840> in<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.140> open<00:00:37.500> and

liked it sensitivity brightness I mean

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.370 
liked it sensitivity brightness I mean
this<00:04:12.849> little<00:04:13.180> sensor<00:04:13.390> right<00:04:13.599> here<00:04:13.660> senses<00:04:14.230> if

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
this little sensor right here senses if

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:15.449 
this little sensor right here senses if
anyone's<00:04:14.709> in<00:04:14.830> front<00:04:14.980> of<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.099> computer<00:04:15.250> and

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:15.459 
anyone's in front of the computer and

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:18.060 
anyone's in front of the computer and
can<00:04:15.700> turn<00:04:15.880> off<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.450> monitor<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.019> then<00:04:17.979> when

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
can turn off the monitor and then when

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:19.199 
can turn off the monitor and then when
you<00:04:18.130> sit<00:04:18.310> back<00:04:18.400> down<00:04:18.579> I'll<00:04:18.729> turn<00:04:18.880> back<00:04:18.910> on

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
you sit back down I'll turn back on

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
that's pretty cool your 3d displays

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.510 
that's pretty cool your 3d displays
right<00:04:22.360> here<00:04:22.720> now<00:04:23.470> all<00:04:23.860> these<00:04:24.100> other<00:04:24.250> ones

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
right here now all these other ones

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.040 
right here now all these other ones
didn't<00:04:24.820> work<00:04:25.000> for<00:04:25.030> me<00:04:25.360> except<00:04:25.690> for<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:25.990> one

2d to 3d and I know you guys can't

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.719 
2d to 3d and I know you guys can't
really<00:04:29.950> see<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.490> but<00:04:31.830> it<00:04:32.830> is<00:04:33.039> it<00:04:33.250> was<00:04:33.550> like<00:04:33.580> a

really see much but it is it was like a
double<00:04:33.880> image<00:04:34.090> yeah<00:04:34.600> it<00:04:34.900> is<00:04:35.110> in<00:04:35.380> fact<00:04:35.590> you<00:04:36.100> know

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
double image yeah it is in fact you know

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:39.779 
double image yeah it is in fact you know
and<00:04:37.390> you<00:04:37.539> also<00:04:37.690> have<00:04:37.870> a<00:04:37.930> depth<00:04:38.229> control<00:04:38.590> too<00:04:39.130> as

00:04:39.779 --> 00:04:39.789 
and you also have a depth control too as

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.290 
and you also have a depth control too as
far<00:04:40.120> as<00:04:40.270> 3d<00:04:40.660> goes<00:04:41.400> oops<00:04:42.400> I<00:04:42.729> messed<00:04:43.060> up<00:04:43.270> a

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
far as 3d goes oops I messed up a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.890 
far as 3d goes oops I messed up a
gesture<00:04:43.750> 3d<00:04:44.850> yeah<00:04:45.880> here's<00:04:46.450> your<00:04:46.630> depth

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
gesture 3d yeah here's your depth

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.190 
gesture 3d yeah here's your depth
controller<00:04:47.440> so<00:04:48.479> or<00:04:49.479> just<00:04:49.600> thanks<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.080> out

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
controller so or just thanks it out

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:58.290 
controller so or just thanks it out
that's<00:04:50.500> cool<00:04:51.570> or<00:04:52.570> just<00:04:52.600> eggs<00:04:53.050> out<00:04:53.820> okay<00:04:57.300> Hunter

that's cool or just eggs out okay Hunter
there<00:04:59.050> we<00:04:59.169> go

00:05:00.309 --> 00:05:00.319 
there we go

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:03.489 
there we go
so<00:05:01.330> now<00:05:02.330> with<00:05:02.509> the<00:05:02.629> depth<00:05:02.809> on<00:05:02.960> one<00:05:03.229> you<00:05:03.379> can

00:05:03.489 --> 00:05:03.499 
so now with the depth on one you can

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:05.679 
so now with the depth on one you can
barely<00:05:03.710> even<00:05:03.860> tell<00:05:03.979> it's<00:05:04.249> on<00:05:04.339> barely<00:05:05.119> as<00:05:05.479> far

00:05:05.679 --> 00:05:05.689 
barely even tell it's on barely as far

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:09.219 
barely even tell it's on barely as far
as<00:05:05.809> 3<00:05:06.020> D<00:05:06.110> goes<00:05:06.939> if<00:05:07.939> you<00:05:08.119> watch<00:05:08.300> make<00:05:08.569> it<00:05:08.689> turn<00:05:08.839> 3d

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
as 3 D goes if you watch make it turn 3d

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.439 
as 3 D goes if you watch make it turn 3d
back<00:05:09.499> off<00:05:09.740> and<00:05:10.219> then<00:05:10.909> when<00:05:11.029> you<00:05:11.089> pick<00:05:11.240> up<00:05:11.330> as

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 
back off and then when you pick up as

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.399 
back off and then when you pick up as
much<00:05:11.539> more<00:05:11.749> crisp

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:12.409 
much more crisp

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:14.260 
much more crisp
yeah<00:05:13.189> they<00:05:13.309> mentioned<00:05:13.580> blade<00:05:13.759> better<00:05:13.969> without

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
yeah they mentioned blade better without

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.659 
yeah they mentioned blade better without
3d<00:05:14.479> this<00:05:15.289> is<00:05:15.409> a<00:05:15.439> definitely<00:05:16.009> the<00:05:16.279> best<00:05:16.460> 2d

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.669 
3d this is a definitely the best 2d

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:20.619 
3d this is a definitely the best 2d
monitor<00:05:17.149> ever<00:05:17.800> 3d<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.339> really<00:05:20.119> need<00:05:20.330> to<00:05:20.449> go<00:05:20.569> to

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
monitor ever 3d you really need to go to

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:23.230 
monitor ever 3d you really need to go to
video<00:05:20.990> for<00:05:21.289> that<00:05:21.319> one<00:05:21.669> price<00:05:22.669> and<00:05:22.879> I've<00:05:22.939> seen

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:23.240 
video for that one price and I've seen

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.409 
video for that one price and I've seen
some<00:05:23.479> in<00:05:23.569> video<00:05:23.839> 3d<00:05:24.199> with<00:05:24.439> the<00:05:24.649> big<00:05:25.610> box<00:05:25.939> and

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:26.419 
some in video 3d with the big box and

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.909 
some in video 3d with the big box and
all<00:05:26.539> that<00:05:26.779> and<00:05:27.080> there's<00:05:27.259> a<00:05:27.319> reason<00:05:27.409> for<00:05:27.770> that

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
all that and there's a reason for that

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:29.499 
all that and there's a reason for that
box<00:05:28.129> is<00:05:28.399> because<00:05:28.580> it<00:05:28.699> handles<00:05:28.969> a<00:05:29.029> 3d<00:05:29.300> better

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
box is because it handles a 3d better

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.350 
box is because it handles a 3d better
than<00:05:29.719> you<00:05:30.050> know<00:05:30.139> Samsung<00:05:30.879> we'rewe're<00:05:31.879> image

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
than you know Samsung we'rewe're image

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.480 
than you know Samsung we'rewe're image
technology<00:05:33.110> that<00:05:33.379> it<00:05:33.469> just<00:05:33.649> slows<00:05:33.889> one<00:05:34.189> frame

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
technology that it just slows one frame

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.309 
technology that it just slows one frame
down<00:05:34.729> and<00:05:35.180> then<00:05:35.360> speeds<00:05:35.629> another<00:05:35.869> frame<00:05:36.139> up

00:05:36.309 --> 00:05:36.319 
down and then speeds another frame up

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.320 
down and then speeds another frame up
and<00:05:36.529> like<00:05:36.740> means<00:05:36.919> in<00:05:37.039> the<00:05:37.099> center<00:05:37.459> and<00:05:37.789> like

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.330 
and like means in the center and like

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:40.449 
and like means in the center and like
that<00:05:38.539> gives<00:05:38.749> you<00:05:38.839> the<00:05:38.959> 3d<00:05:39.259> image<00:05:39.589> it's<00:05:40.129> kind<00:05:40.399> of

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:40.459 
that gives you the 3d image it's kind of

00:05:40.459 --> 00:05:43.689 
that gives you the 3d image it's kind of
like<00:05:40.550> the<00:05:40.759> 3d<00:05:41.509> s<00:05:41.749> is<00:05:41.959> 3d<00:05:42.289> but<00:05:42.559> better<00:05:42.800> because

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
like the 3d s is 3d but better because

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:45.730 
like the 3d s is 3d but better because
you<00:05:43.879> know<00:05:43.909> you<00:05:44.509> need<00:05:44.659> glasses<00:05:44.809> and<00:05:45.379> obviously

00:05:45.730 --> 00:05:45.740 
you know you need glasses and obviously

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:47.079 
you know you need glasses and obviously
it's<00:05:46.009> a<00:05:46.069> little<00:05:46.129> bit<00:05:46.339> better<00:05:46.459> and<00:05:46.669> I<00:05:46.699> have<00:05:46.849> to

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:47.089 
it's a little bit better and I have to

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.029 
it's a little bit better and I have to
