hey<00:00:00.810> guys<00:00:01.050> Berg<00:00:01.860> brew<00:00:02.040> here<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.490> don't<00:00:03.449> just

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hey guys Berg brew here I don't just

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.750 
hey guys Berg brew here I don't just
found<00:00:05.130> out<00:00:05.339> a<00:00:05.370> cool<00:00:05.819> way<00:00:06.029> to<00:00:06.060> make<00:00:06.629> loss

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
found out a cool way to make loss

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.400 
found out a cool way to make loss
unbreakable<00:00:08.760> like<00:00:09.000> see<00:00:09.599> how<00:00:09.630> I<00:00:09.750> didn't<00:00:10.139> select

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
unbreakable like see how I didn't select

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.080 
unbreakable like see how I didn't select
this<00:00:10.590> block<00:00:10.950> and<00:00:11.250> I<00:00:11.309> can<00:00:11.490> look<00:00:11.639> around<00:00:11.790> and

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
this block and I can look around and

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.849 
this block and I can look around and
actually<00:00:12.300> break<00:00:12.750> it<00:00:12.980> so<00:00:14.809> I<00:00:15.809> found<00:00:16.470> a<00:00:16.650> way<00:00:16.800> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
actually break it so I found a way to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.210 
actually break it so I found a way to
overcome<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:18.090> this<00:00:19.050> way<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.650> not<00:00:19.949> very

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
overcome that now this way is not very

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.689 
overcome that now this way is not very
effective<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.390> wouldn't<00:00:22.400> recommend<00:00:23.400> this

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
effective so I wouldn't recommend this

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.620 
effective so I wouldn't recommend this
format<00:00:24.150> makers<00:00:24.600> but<00:00:24.900> it's<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.590> cool<00:00:25.769> concept<00:00:26.039> so

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
format makers but it's a cool concept so

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.070 
format makers but it's a cool concept so
let's<00:00:27.630> just<00:00:28.019> build<00:00:28.980> up<00:00:29.369> a<00:00:29.429> bit<00:00:29.789> give<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.779> block

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
let's just build up a bit give a block

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:46.250 
let's just build up a bit give a block
here<00:00:36.020> awesome<00:00:43.190> in<00:00:44.190> this<00:00:44.940> top<00:00:45.510> command<00:00:45.989> block

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
here awesome in this top command block

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.760 
here awesome in this top command block
readers<00:00:46.559> can<00:00:46.739> read<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.510> command

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
readers can read this command

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250 
readers can read this command
which<00:00:50.700> basically<00:00:50.910> sums<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.720> falling<00:00:52.050> sad

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
which basically sums of falling sad

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.070 
which basically sums of falling sad
falling<00:00:52.590> Santa<00:00:53.010> is<00:00:53.070> an<00:00:53.280> entity<00:00:53.870> you<00:00:54.870> might

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
falling Santa is an entity you might

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.430 
falling Santa is an entity you might
know<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.500> um<00:00:56.570> but<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:59.720> edit<00:01:00.720> it's<00:01:01.140> NBD

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
know this um but you can edit it's NBD

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.299 
know this um but you can edit it's NBD
text<00:01:01.920> is<00:01:02.160> much<00:01:02.430> easier<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:03.150> spawning<00:01:04.020> it<00:01:04.309> so

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
text is much easier and spawning it so

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.860 
text is much easier and spawning it so
that<00:01:07.040> spawns<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.280> certain<00:01:08.820> block<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.420> that

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:09.870 
that spawns a certain block now that

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.530 
that spawns a certain block now that
block<00:01:10.140> is<00:01:10.470> ID<00:01:10.820> 36<00:01:11.820> tile<00:01:12.260> as<00:01:13.260> you<00:01:13.500> see<00:01:13.710> title<00:01:14.280> ID

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
block is ID 36 tile as you see title ID

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.650 
block is ID 36 tile as you see title ID
it<00:01:15.540> means<00:01:16.350> the<00:01:16.800> block<00:01:17.070> can't<00:01:17.610> fall<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.150> this

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
it means the block can't fall and this

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.410 
it means the block can't fall and this
time<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.290> at<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:20.520> make<00:01:20.700> sure<00:01:20.880> that<00:01:21.119> it

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
time is just at to make sure that it

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.490 
time is just at to make sure that it
doesn't<00:01:21.690> d<00:01:22.170> sponsors<00:01:22.860> this<00:01:23.369> is<00:01:23.610> an<00:01:23.759> entity<00:01:24.500> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
doesn't d sponsors this is an entity so

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.859 
doesn't d sponsors this is an entity so
just<00:01:26.430> did<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> that's<00:01:27.360> going<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.630> spawn

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
just did that that's going to spawn

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.410 
just did that that's going to spawn
right<00:01:28.229> underneath<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.250> block<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:30.090> a<00:01:30.149> false

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
right underneath this block and a false

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.910 
right underneath this block and a false
right<00:01:30.660> down<00:01:31.100> now<00:01:32.100> in<00:01:32.369> this<00:01:33.200> command<00:01:34.200> block<00:01:34.410> I'm

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
right down now in this command block I'm

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.680 
right down now in this command block I'm
gonna<00:01:35.220> set<00:01:35.840> block

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
gonna set block

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:45.190 
gonna set block
three<00:01:39.320> blocks<00:01:39.590> down<00:01:40.930> flex<00:01:42.040> 36<00:01:43.040> again<00:01:43.340> now<00:01:44.200> what

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
three blocks down flex 36 again now what

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.140 
three blocks down flex 36 again now what
block<00:01:45.500> 36<00:01:46.190> is<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:48.160> the<00:01:49.160> head<00:01:49.400> of<00:01:49.580> a<00:01:49.700> sticky

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.150 
block 36 is is the head of a sticky

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.410 
block 36 is is the head of a sticky
piston<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.810> think<00:01:51.170> not<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.890> sure<00:01:51.920> they<00:01:52.730> do<00:01:53.210> too

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
piston I think not to sure they do too

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.090 
piston I think not to sure they do too
much<00:01:53.540> research<00:01:53.930> about<00:01:54.230> it<00:01:54.410> just<00:01:54.890> know<00:01:55.070> that

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
much research about it just know that

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.000 
much research about it just know that
it's<00:01:55.910> an<00:01:56.000> invisible<00:01:56.510> block<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:57.140> front<00:01:57.320> the

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:58.010 
it's an invisible block in front the

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.760 
it's an invisible block in front the
bottom<00:01:58.520> padlock<00:02:00.520> invisible<00:02:01.520> block<00:02:02.530> can<00:02:03.530> pass

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
bottom padlock invisible block can pass

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.170 
bottom padlock invisible block can pass
through<00:02:04.250> it<00:02:04.390> can't<00:02:05.390> pick<00:02:05.630> it<00:02:05.720> up<00:02:07.000> pick<00:02:08.000> it<00:02:08.060> up

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
through it can't pick it up pick it up

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.080 
through it can't pick it up pick it up
and<00:02:08.560> but<00:02:09.560> yeah<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.010> can<00:02:10.130> always<00:02:10.460> break<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.850> but

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
and but yeah you can always break it but

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.110 
and but yeah you can always break it but
when<00:02:11.480> falling<00:02:11.990> sand<00:02:12.530> is<00:02:12.890> here<00:02:13.450> then<00:02:14.680> it<00:02:16.120> just

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
when falling sand is here then it just

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.790 
when falling sand is here then it just
um<00:02:18.640> can't<00:02:19.640> select<00:02:20.000> this<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:20.540> there's<00:02:21.320> a<00:02:21.380> block

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
um can't select this and there's a block

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.280 
um can't select this and there's a block
here<00:02:21.830> so<00:02:22.250> if<00:02:22.790> i<00:02:22.880> change<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:23.450> ID<00:02:23.690> real<00:02:24.050> quick

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
here so if i change this ID real quick

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.200 
here so if i change this ID real quick
to<00:02:24.590> iron<00:02:25.360> 42<00:02:26.770> let's<00:02:27.770> delete<00:02:28.130> this<00:02:28.430> pull<00:02:29.120> the

to iron 42 let's delete this pull the

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:31.870 
to iron 42 let's delete this pull the
lever<00:02:29.560> see<00:02:30.560> we<00:02:30.710> have<00:02:30.800> an<00:02:30.920> iron<00:02:31.160> block<00:02:31.490> here<00:02:31.790> if

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
lever see we have an iron block here if

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.910 
lever see we have an iron block here if
it's<00:02:32.030> not<00:02:32.360> actually<00:02:32.930> here<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.320> just<00:02:33.410> the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
it's not actually here it's just the

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.460 
it's not actually here it's just the
entity<00:02:34.400> now<00:02:35.090> we<00:02:35.150> can<00:02:35.360> get<00:02:35.480> rid<00:02:35.660> of<00:02:35.750> this<00:02:35.930> is<00:02:36.230> if

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:36.470 
entity now we can get rid of this is if

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.560 
entity now we can get rid of this is if
it<00:02:36.920> could<00:02:37.130> listen<00:02:37.430> now<00:02:37.670> stuck<00:02:38.060> inside<00:02:38.240> that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.570 
it could listen now stuck inside that

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:40.300 
it could listen now stuck inside that
box<00:02:38.780> not<00:02:39.140> moving<00:02:39.560> anywhere<00:02:39.770> it<00:02:39.980> looks<00:02:40.130> like<00:02:40.280> a

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
box not moving anywhere it looks like a

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.760 
box not moving anywhere it looks like a
block<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.600> though<00:02:41.840> m

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:50.970 

whew<00:02:47.770> you<00:02:48.190> can<00:02:48.340> just<00:02:48.880> see<00:02:49.540> that<00:02:49.570> it's<00:02:50.230> one

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
whew you can just see that it's one

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.520 
whew you can just see that it's one
lower<00:02:51.810> that's<00:02:52.810> how<00:02:52.930> you<00:02:52.990> can<00:02:53.140> tell<00:02:53.170> thought

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530

36<00:03:45.130> is<00:03:45.340> there<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:46.390> the<00:03:47.100> sand<00:03:48.100> falling<00:03:49.000> sand<00:03:49.360> of

36 is there and the sand falling sand of

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:54.420 
36 is there and the sand falling sand of
36<00:03:50.230> is<00:03:50.470> also<00:03:52.200> another<00:03:53.200> both<00:03:53.560> invisible<00:03:53.920> block

36 is also another both invisible block

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.240 
36 is also another both invisible block
so<00:03:54.730> but<00:03:55.690> because<00:03:56.020> there's<00:03:56.380> falling<00:03:56.770> sand<00:03:57.040> on

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
so but because there's falling sand on

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.740 
so but because there's falling sand on
top<00:03:57.400> of<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.910> rock<00:03:58.810> 36<00:03:59.610> you<00:04:00.610> can't<00:04:00.940> see<00:04:01.570> the

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
top of the rock 36 you can't see the

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.400 
top of the rock 36 you can't see the
outline<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.230> block<00:04:02.530> 36<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.520> and<00:04:04.270> lock<00:04:04.780> 36

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.410

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.410 
outline of block 36 and and lock 36
itself<00:04:05.800> is<00:04:05.890> invisible<00:04:06.430> so<00:04:06.640> there's<00:04:07.000> no<00:04:07.209> way<00:04:07.360> to

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
itself is invisible so there's no way to

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.300 
itself is invisible so there's no way to
tell<00:04:07.660> there's<00:04:07.900> a<00:04:07.989> clock<00:04:08.200> here<00:04:08.380> and<00:04:09.010> you<00:04:09.070> can't

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
tell there's a clock here and you can't

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:10.470

place<00:04:09.520> block<00:04:09.820> and<00:04:10.060> right<00:04:10.150> now<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.300> right

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
place block and right now and right

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.070 
place block and right now and right
clicking<00:04:11.250> that's<00:04:12.250> not<00:04:12.459> working<00:04:12.670> now<00:04:12.940> I'm<00:04:13.750> not

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
gonna break this underneath because then

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.659 
gonna break this underneath because then
it's<00:04:17.320> going<00:04:17.470> to<00:04:17.560> crash<00:04:17.859> my<00:04:17.919> game<00:04:18.400> already

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:41.450 
to fix it so don't break that block

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.280 
to fix it so don't break that block
don't<00:04:42.450> but<00:04:43.020> now<00:04:43.260> see<00:04:44.130> can't<00:04:44.460> break<00:04:45.200> that's<00:04:46.200> how

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
don't but now see can't break that's how

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.350 
don't but now see can't break that's how
you<00:04:46.350> make<00:04:46.560> any<00:04:47.100> block<00:04:47.520> like<00:04:47.790> obviously<00:04:48.270> you

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
you make any block like obviously you

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.760 
you make any block like obviously you
can't<00:04:48.540> go<00:04:48.690> to<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.870> top<00:04:49.020> so<00:04:49.290> if<00:04:49.500> you<00:04:49.650> have<00:04:49.740> a

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
can't go to the top so if you have a

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.510 
can't go to the top so if you have a
huge<00:04:50.510> flat<00:04:51.510> platform<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:53.010> can<00:04:53.040> just<00:04:54.020> make<00:04:55.020> it

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:55.520 
huge flat platform you can just make it

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.430 
huge flat platform you can just make it
make<00:04:56.520> Glock<00:04:57.030> 36<00:04:57.420> on<00:04:57.810> top<00:04:58.020> and<00:04:58.640> you<00:04:59.640> drop<00:05:00.240> box<00:05:00.840> 36

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
make Glock 36 on top and you drop box 36

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:08.200 
make Glock 36 on top and you drop box 36
into<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:02.210> so<00:05:03.210> um<00:05:03.510> that's<00:05:04.440> all<00:05:05.100> for<00:05:05.400> today<00:05:05.670> oh<00:05:06.980> I

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
you might have caught a glimpse of that

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.710 
you might have caught a glimpse of that
but<00:05:31.290> there<00:05:31.620> is<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.890> hitbox<00:05:32.220> their<00:05:32.790> fat<00:05:33.060> hitboxes

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
but there is a hitbox their fat hitboxes

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:36.470 
but there is a hitbox their fat hitboxes
block<00:05:34.020> 36<00:05:34.620> now<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:35.550> just<00:05:35.670> appears<00:05:36.120> to<00:05:36.270> push

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:36.480 
block 36 now that just appears to push

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.610 
block 36 now that just appears to push
blocks<00:05:36.920> when<00:05:37.920> you<00:05:38.850> pull<00:05:39.240> the<00:05:39.390> lever<00:05:39.600> here<00:05:40.170> you

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:40.620 
blocks when you pull the lever here you

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:42.650 
blocks when you pull the lever here you
can<00:05:40.830> see<00:05:41.010> that<00:05:41.040> real<00:05:41.370> quick<00:05:41.610> that's<00:05:42.450> what

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
can see that real quick that's what

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:44.810 
can see that real quick that's what
pushes<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.230> block<00:05:43.470> it's<00:05:43.770> not<00:05:44.040> the<00:05:44.310> piston<00:05:44.700> are

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
pushes the block it's not the piston are

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.400 
pushes the block it's not the piston are
the<00:05:45.030> piston<00:05:45.330> arm<00:05:45.540> is<00:05:46.260> that<00:05:46.440> I'd<00:05:46.560> be<00:05:46.680> 34

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:48.410 
the piston arm is that I'd be 34

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.830 
the piston arm is that I'd be 34
so<00:05:49.460> that's<00:05:50.460> all<00:05:50.670> for<00:05:50.700> today<00:05:51.120> I<00:05:51.150> know<00:05:51.420> it<00:05:51.540> wasn't
