00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 as they are my name is alfredo 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.250
 trabulse and I'm the creator of the site 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.790
 ipad seminars where we have them 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.640
 videos and tips and tutorials on how to use 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.850
 your ipad 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.150
 this time more than how to use the 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.550
 ipad is an application that I found 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:28.050
 which I consider to be of much use 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.660
 because the iPad although it is a tablet 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.120
 it is simply is also a 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 computer that also has its disk 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.120
 hard though it's pure memory but it does not stop 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.739
 to be the same functioning as a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.690
 hard disk then it is also filled with 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:50.010
 archives and of woman the going medium 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:53.159
 discarding the ipad and with time then 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.680
 This application is encouraging me 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:59.159
 I found it's called franklin and I'm here 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.540
 on the site including the site of them 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.409
 can go to the web 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.799
 and the directions 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.120
 this is the address on the web of 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:13.140
 system 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.860
 of the software and it's one is a file that 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.300
 it's free is a free program then 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.030
 just when when they are here in 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.010
 the site will give you download now and it's 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.440
 a normal process as they will be installed 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.380
 any kind of software in your 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:34.399
 computer we are going to give you download 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.700
 is going to go down to move to this page and 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.460
 right now it will lower the 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:42.400
 to download the program here they save it to 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.540
 his computer 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:49.050
 and continues in the process of 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:52.250
 and install it ok 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:54.680
 once we install in the program 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.060
 it looks like 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.810
 since they start it on their 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:03.800
 computer the only requirement is that your 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:07.420
 ipad must be connected through 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.429
 from the usb port to your computer 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.110
 I can not show you here because 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.209
 I'm recording the screen directly 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.870
 but my ipad is connected to me 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.390
 computer 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.410
 so if you look here, it says 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:23.100
 full capacity of my ipad 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.480
 30 30 gigas 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.810
 and then he says that I'm using 6.48 and I 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.459
 they are free 23 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.690
 then at the time you are going to give 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:40.620
 here start and it's going to be a calculation of 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:43.560
 all the files and trash and documents 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:47.040
 that they serve us on my ipad that can 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:49.530
 delete to make it cleaner the 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.660
 memory or the hard drive of my ipad the 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.640
 Let's give and can start 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.330
 and here he will start doing the calculation 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:03:00.569
 of everything that is on my ipad 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.999
 that does not serve me 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.450
 here for example is scanning what 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:08.200
 are temporary files time 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.260
 two 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.170
 following here takes six that has 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.930
 found and here is giving us a 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.069
 percentage of what's going on 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.069
 advancing inside him 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.160
 touring the ipad 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.980
 ok here and I advanced a little more here 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:30.550
 we can see that it was almost 2 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.400
 megabytes of jong 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.330
 and here is checking everything that is called 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:38.800
 the case 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:42.100
 all the files that you create for 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.590
 to work on the ipad and here already 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.140
 It's almost 500 megabytes, so if we're 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.400
 taking up a lot of wasted space 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.769
 our ipad 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.840
 and if you have a lot of music there 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.569
 many videos and all that kind of stuff 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.439
 well 

00:03:55.569 --> 00:04:02.140
 the cleaner keep your disc 

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:04.510
 hard or memory 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.670
 more are going to have to store things that 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.310
 you really need, I'm not going to 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.640
 put back pause while it ends 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.280
 and now we come back 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:20.620
 ok then it's over 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:23.830
 and here are 540 megabytes here are 147 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.230
 kilobytes of cookie cookie is a file 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.950
 that saves the internet sites that 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:32.139
 you visit to remember what 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:34.980
 they did or if they are a jucio ne I happened to 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:39.480
 remember 15m my password 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:42.500
 yes if you do not want the ipad to 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:46.050
 I forgot information that they captured 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:51.289
 then they simply remove this and already 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:54.800
 not cleared and put it erases 

00:04:51.289 --> 00:04:57.860
 once I finish you can give here and 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:59.899
 teaches them the detail of the files in 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:04.069
 my case for example is the google chrome 

00:04:59.899 --> 00:05:06.169
 which is the browser the dropbox the gmail and 

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:08.029
 whatsapp whatsapp is an application 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:11.740
 new that is very father that I'm leaving 

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:11.740
 to show in another video 

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:16.720
 so here we can see the 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.770
 files that you will delete for example from 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.710
 cache 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:23.990
 here yes there are many fix boxcar 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.699
 capture that this is a program that I use 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.770
 to make direct ipad videos 

00:05:25.699 --> 00:05:32.030
 chrome and so on 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:34.370
 the pri by frequency flipper facebook 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.689
 that has many choose on facebook is 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.639
 of those who have more ok 

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:41.289
 then since they decide that if they want 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:43.830
 delete everything for example in my case if 

00:05:41.289 --> 00:05:46.179
 I'm going to erase everything I tell them to clean it 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.899
 and it's going to start erasing all 

00:05:46.179 --> 00:05:51.080
 files if it is if it is an application 

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:54.289
 relatively 

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:56.950
 that ends quickly but while it ends 

00:05:54.289 --> 00:05:59.510
 let's put it back to pause 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:02.450
 and there we go back 

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:06.740
 ok then here it's over and here we 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:09.870
 he says how much space he recovered he recovered 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:12.090
 that almost 550 megs 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.670
 on my ipad 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.130
 and right now I remain 

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:19.180
 Since I'm clean, I do not have any 

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.660
 trash 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.660
 I probably do not notice any 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:28.930
 no difference in him 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:31.630
 use but it is an application that will 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:34.170
 I recommend that they run from time to time 

00:06:31.630 --> 00:06:34.170
 on your ipad 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:41.210
 very well I hope and this application will 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.750
 be very useful and see you soon 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:47.230
 in the next video I'm again 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.990
 altered trabulsi
