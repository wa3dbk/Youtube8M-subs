00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
about the same thing but when I went to

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.549 
about the same thing but when I went to
the<00:00:55.440> market<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.920> still<00:00:56.190> dumb<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:57.270> on<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:58.199> pans

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
the market I still dumb so on the pans

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.799 
the market I still dumb so on the pans
before<00:00:59.370> with<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.820> quite<00:01:00.059> different<00:01:00.539> by<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
before with the quite different by the

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.189 
before with the quite different by the
changing<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.320> this<00:01:01.500> sword<00:01:01.800> thing<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.480> think

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
changing to this sword thing and I think

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.620 
changing to this sword thing and I think
they<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:04.559> pretty<00:01:04.830> well<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:05.369> I<00:01:06.330> believe

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
they work pretty well and I believe

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.920 
they work pretty well and I believe
there<00:01:06.780> are<00:01:06.930> two<00:01:07.170> kinds<00:01:07.710> of<00:01:08.119> like<00:01:09.119> maybe<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
there are two kinds of like maybe the

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.160 
there are two kinds of like maybe the
most<00:01:10.200> common<00:01:10.770> two<00:01:11.010> kinds<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.600> pains<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.840> hot

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
most common two kinds of pains for hot

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.219 
most common two kinds of pains for hot
rollers<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:15.000> kind<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.750> of<00:01:15.810> clap

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
rollers are the kind of a kind of clap

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.770 
rollers are the kind of a kind of clap
and<00:01:16.909> this<00:01:17.909> sort<00:01:18.150> of<00:01:18.210> thing<00:01:18.270> and<00:01:18.630> actually

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
and this sort of thing and actually

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.109 
and this sort of thing and actually
prefer<00:01:19.290> this<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:20.040> collapse<00:01:20.520> can<00:01:20.850> I'll

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
prefer this because collapse can I'll

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
prefer this because collapse can I'll
leave<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:21.840> marks<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.409> your<00:01:22.530> hair<00:01:22.710> if<00:01:22.979> you

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
leave some marks on your hair if you

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.679 
leave some marks on your hair if you
don't<00:01:23.250> use<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.430> properly<00:01:23.729> so<00:01:24.000> this<00:01:24.450> thing<00:01:24.659> is

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
don't use it properly so this thing is

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.320 
don't use it properly so this thing is
more<00:01:25.110> foolproof<00:01:25.409> so<00:01:26.310> we<00:01:26.520> pre<00:01:26.759> interested<00:01:27.240> in

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
more foolproof so we pre interested in

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.390 
more foolproof so we pre interested in
now<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.630> have<00:01:27.990> to<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.290> hot<00:01:28.500> rollers<00:01:28.530> flick<00:01:29.250> it

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
now we have to use hot rollers flick it

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
now we have to use hot rollers flick it
for<00:01:29.520> watching<00:01:29.820> so<00:01:30.689> we<00:01:30.869> first<00:01:31.140> is<00:01:31.290> section<00:01:31.650> our

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
for watching so we first is section our

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.530 
for watching so we first is section our
hair<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.880> quite<00:01:33.030> easy<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
hair and it's quite easy you just

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.819 
hair and it's quite easy you just
sectioning<00:01:34.110> into<00:01:34.560> three<00:01:34.890> parts<00:01:35.520> and<00:01:36.829> two

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
sectioning into three parts and two

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.230 
sectioning into three parts and two
sections<00:01:38.610> on<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> side<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.450> one<00:01:40.220> like<00:01:41.240> from

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
sections on the side and one like from

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.210 
sections on the side and one like from
here<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.170> behind<00:01:43.590> you<00:01:44.460> must<00:01:44.970> really<00:01:45.180> need<00:01:45.479> to

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
here to behind you must really need to

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.889 
here to behind you must really need to
section<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.340> perfectly<00:01:47.939> because<00:01:48.329> you<00:01:48.810> know

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
section it perfectly because you know

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.590 
section it perfectly because you know
the<00:01:49.079> curls<00:01:49.409> are<00:01:49.560> going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> come<00:01:50.100> together

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:50.600 
the curls are going to come together

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.149 
the curls are going to come together
just<00:01:51.600> some<00:01:51.869> keep<00:01:52.229> in<00:01:52.380> mind<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.860> worth

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
just some keep in mind that I worth
