00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.089 

so<00:00:05.490> the<00:00:05.640> study<00:00:06.120> is<00:00:06.450> about<00:00:07.049> using<00:00:07.620> their

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
so the study is about using their

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.850 
so the study is about using their
knowledge<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:09.170> anti-aging<00:00:10.170> systems<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
knowledge of the anti-aging systems and

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.990 
knowledge of the anti-aging systems and
really<00:00:11.790> 50<00:00:12.330> years<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.750> our<00:00:13.320> work<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:14.000> aging

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
really 50 years of our work with aging

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.430 
really 50 years of our work with aging
and<00:00:15.150> mechanisms<00:00:15.690> of<00:00:15.809> aging<00:00:16.109> but<00:00:16.289> also

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
and mechanisms of aging but also

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.950 
and mechanisms of aging but also
mechanisms<00:00:17.190> of<00:00:17.340> resistance<00:00:18.060> to<00:00:18.150> stress<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
mechanisms of resistance to stress and

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.769 
mechanisms of resistance to stress and
so<00:00:19.320> we<00:00:19.529> started<00:00:19.890> thinking<00:00:20.400> of<00:00:20.520> ways<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.850> we

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
so we started thinking of ways that we

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.710 
so we started thinking of ways that we
can<00:00:22.080> use<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.650> knowledge<00:00:22.830> of<00:00:23.100> gerontology<00:00:23.720> to

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
can use the knowledge of gerontology to

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.580 
can use the knowledge of gerontology to
prevent<00:00:25.350> cancer<00:00:25.859> but<00:00:26.130> also<00:00:26.340> to<00:00:27.269> help<00:00:27.930> with<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
prevent cancer but also to help with the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.250 
prevent cancer but also to help with the
toxicity<00:00:29.400> caused<00:00:29.760> by<00:00:29.970> chemotherapy<00:00:30.210> one<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
toxicity caused by chemotherapy one of

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:32.959 
toxicity caused by chemotherapy one of
the<00:00:31.349> major<00:00:31.439> experiments<00:00:32.070> that<00:00:32.099> we<00:00:32.309> did<00:00:32.489> was<00:00:32.730> to

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
the major experiments that we did was to

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.620 
the major experiments that we did was to
inject<00:00:33.360> a<00:00:33.660> very<00:00:34.200> aggressive<00:00:34.590> neuroblastoma

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:35.630 
inject a very aggressive neuroblastoma

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:39.950 
inject a very aggressive neuroblastoma
cancer<00:00:36.630> into<00:00:37.050> mice<00:00:37.469> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.670> we<00:00:39.390> start<00:00:39.719> them

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
cancer into mice and then we start them

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.740 
cancer into mice and then we start them
for<00:00:40.170> 48<00:00:40.649> hours<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.120> hit<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.540> mice

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
for 48 hours and then we hit the mice

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.100 
for 48 hours and then we hit the mice
and<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.980> neuroblastoma<00:00:44.629> cancer<00:00:45.629> with

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
and the neuroblastoma cancer with

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.350 
and the neuroblastoma cancer with
high-dose<00:00:46.469> chemotherapy<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.910> mice<00:00:48.120> they

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
high-dose chemotherapy the mice they

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.540 
high-dose chemotherapy the mice they
were<00:00:48.510> starved<00:00:49.320> for<00:00:49.440> 48<00:00:49.800> hours<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.280> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
were starved for 48 hours and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.880 
were starved for 48 hours and then
treated<00:00:51.000> with<00:00:51.120> high-dose<00:00:51.360> chemotherapy<00:00:51.890> were

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890

lot<00:01:31.500> of<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.710> times<00:01:31.979> tells<00:01:32.579> you<00:01:32.790> a<00:01:32.820> lot<00:01:33.000> more

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
lot of the times tells you a lot more

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.420 
lot of the times tells you a lot more
about<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:34.670> complicated<00:01:35.670> or<00:01:35.850> complex

about the complicated or complex

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.700 
about the complicated or complex
problems<00:01:38.430> then<00:01:38.790> then<00:01:39.600> applied<00:01:39.900> research<00:01:40.320> we

knew<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.070> worked<00:01:41.280> very<00:01:41.430> well<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:42.090> the

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
knew it worked very well in the

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.330 
knew it worked very well in the

eukaryotes and and from there it was
just<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.520> matter<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.210> think<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:51.780> doing<00:01:52.170> a<00:01:52.409> lot<00:01:52.560> of

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just a matter I think of doing a lot of

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.740 
just a matter I think of doing a lot of
experiments<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.790> having<00:01:54.329> a<00:01:54.420> pretty<00:01:54.600> good

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
experiments but having a pretty good

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.870 
experiments but having a pretty good
idea<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.439> this<00:01:55.860> was<00:01:56.100> going<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.340> work<00:01:56.399> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
idea that this was going to work and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.109 
idea that this was going to work and
when<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.390> did<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.630> was<00:01:57.780> it<00:01:58.200> was<00:01:58.380> great<00:01:59.119> obviously

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
when I did it was it was great obviously

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.170 
when I did it was it was great obviously
and<00:02:00.390> even<00:02:01.049> greater<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.649> it<00:02:01.979> works<00:02:02.219> in<00:02:02.520> clinical

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
and even greater if it works in clinical

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.200 
and even greater if it works in clinical
trials

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:05.210
