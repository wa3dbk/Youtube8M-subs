I<00:00:30.210> bought<00:00:30.750> an<00:00:30.900> iMac<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.579> it<00:00:32.579> doesn't<00:00:32.910> blow<00:00:33.059> up

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
I bought an iMac and it doesn't blow up

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.440 
I bought an iMac and it doesn't blow up
as<00:00:33.360> fast<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.230> yours<00:00:34.440> or<00:00:34.710> anything<00:00:34.920> so<00:00:35.579> I've<00:00:36.180> got

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
as fast as yours or anything so I've got

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.700 
as fast as yours or anything so I've got
the<00:00:37.430> 27-inch<00:00:38.430> late<00:00:38.910> turn<00:00:39.210> 11<00:00:39.660> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> three

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the 27-inch late turn 11 with the three

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.400 
the 27-inch late turn 11 with the three
point<00:00:40.980> four<00:00:41.219> gigahertz<00:00:41.550> core<00:00:41.850> i7<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.420> it's

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
point four gigahertz core i7 and it's

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.729 
point four gigahertz core i7 and it's
got<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.710> sixteen<00:00:44.040> gigabytes<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.640> RAM<00:00:45.469> to<00:00:46.469> get

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
got the sixteen gigabytes of RAM to get

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.529 
got the sixteen gigabytes of RAM to get
graphics<00:00:47.129> card<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.610> the<00:00:47.820> two<00:00:48.000> terabyte<00:00:48.300> hard

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
graphics card and the two terabyte hard

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.310 
graphics card and the two terabyte hard
drive<00:00:48.780> with<00:00:49.050> the<00:00:49.710> SSD<00:00:50.039> so<00:00:50.460> that<00:00:50.640> makes<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:51.030> big

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
drive with the SSD so that makes a big

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.889 
drive with the SSD so that makes a big
impact<00:00:52.320> on<00:00:52.610> the<00:00:53.610> actual<00:00:54.059> speed<00:00:54.449> of<00:00:54.480> your<00:00:54.750> blue

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
impact on the actual speed of your blue

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.700 
impact on the actual speed of your blue
ups<00:00:55.140> and<00:00:55.469> just<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> general<00:00:57.350> timings<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.500> how

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
ups and just the general timings of how

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.110 
ups and just the general timings of how
long<00:00:58.920> something<00:00:59.609> takes<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.149> load<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:01.910> so<00:01:02.910> yeah

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
long something takes to load so so yeah

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.320 
long something takes to load so so yeah
let's<00:01:03.510> do<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> give<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
let's do this and then just to give you

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.640 
let's do this and then just to give you
a<00:01:06.360> rough<00:01:06.510> idea<00:01:06.689> of<00:01:06.840> how<00:01:06.930> long<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.290> will<00:01:07.350> take

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
a rough idea of how long it will take

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.340 
a rough idea of how long it will take
I've<00:01:07.860> got<00:01:08.070> my<00:01:08.220> iPhone<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.939> time<00:01:09.119> it<00:01:09.270> with<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
I've got my iPhone to time it with so

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.800 
I've got my iPhone to time it with so
let's<00:01:10.560> see<00:01:10.799> if<00:01:10.950> I<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.189> hit<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.580> wrong<00:01:12.420> button

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
let's see if I can hit the wrong button

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.710 
let's see if I can hit the wrong button
on<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.140> iMac<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.790> the<00:01:14.790> start<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.420> iPhone

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
on the iMac and the start on the iPhone

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:25.200 
on the iMac and the start on the iPhone
at<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.869> same<00:01:15.990> time<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:18.290> two<00:01:19.290> three

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.140 

and<00:01:26.210> there<00:01:26.510> you<00:01:26.720> have<00:01:26.750> the<00:01:27.260> little<00:01:27.980> sound<00:01:28.970> of

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
and there you have the little sound of

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:42.080 
and there you have the little sound of
the<00:01:29.270> UH<00:01:29.300> knock<00:01:29.620> and<00:01:30.620> where<00:01:31.460> around<00:01:31.970> 11<00:01:32.960> seconds

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.710 

and<00:01:42.869> stop<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:44.040> that's<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.579> got<00:01:44.759> around<00:01:44.970> 21

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
and stop and that's I got around 21

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.679 
and stop and that's I got around 21
second<00:01:46.140> point<00:01:46.979> 21.9<00:01:47.759> so<00:01:47.939> you<00:01:48.030> can<00:01:48.149> say<00:01:48.240> 22

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
second point 21.9 so you can say 22

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.760 
second point 21.9 so you can say 22
before<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> got<00:01:49.770> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:49.979> login<00:01:50.250> screen<00:01:50.399> and<00:01:51.770> I

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
before I got to the login screen and I

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.410 
before I got to the login screen and I
know<00:01:52.890> people<00:01:53.369> will<00:01:53.549> say<00:01:53.729> well<00:01:53.909> that's<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
know people will say well that's the

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.969 
know people will say well that's the
login<00:01:54.780> over<00:01:55.020> how<00:01:55.140> long<00:01:55.320> does<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.470> take<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.770> into

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
login over how long does it take to into

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.960 
login over how long does it take to into
the<00:01:56.070> actual<00:01:56.310> OS<00:01:56.610> but<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.789> once<00:01:59.789> you

00:01:59.960 --> 00:01:59.970 
the actual OS but if you know once you

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.840 
the actual OS but if you know once you
login<00:02:00.179> it's<00:02:01.049> literally<00:02:01.560> as<00:02:02.070> soon<00:02:02.429> as<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.700> log

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
login it's literally as soon as you log

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.540 
login it's literally as soon as you log
in<00:02:03.060> you're<00:02:03.479> into<00:02:03.720> the<00:02:03.810> alerts<00:02:04.049> so<00:02:04.979> if<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.429> log<00:02:05.610> in

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:07.550 
in you're into the alerts so if I log in

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.170 
in you're into the alerts so if I log in
I'm<00:02:08.550> into<00:02:08.849> the<00:02:08.940> others<00:02:10.489> straightaway<00:02:11.489> and<00:02:12.000> now

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
I'm into the others straightaway and now

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.539 
I'm into the others straightaway and now
I<00:02:12.209> will<00:02:12.599> be<00:02:12.780> showing<00:02:13.380> you<00:02:13.620> how<00:02:13.890> fast

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
I will be showing you how fast

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.330 
I will be showing you how fast
application<00:02:14.819> load<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.200> how<00:02:16.860> long<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.160> takes

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
application load and how long it takes

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.970 
application load and how long it takes
so<00:02:17.670> I<00:02:17.700> will<00:02:17.910> be<00:02:18.030> using<00:02:18.120> ScreenFlow<00:02:18.510> 4<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.319> that

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
so I will be using ScreenFlow 4 and that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.330 
so I will be using ScreenFlow 4 and that
