00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.589
 when you are new to the trouble of buying a little 

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:17.679
 he is OK 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 hydraulic shock absorbers 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.039
 firstly the bearings the tipnis on arrival to correctly choose these 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:27.220
 themes 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:30.169
 there will be a lot of trial and error to get there it must 

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:31.269
 I would have understood 

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:32.830
 how to choose tires 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.310
 you have passed a course and their cost 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.610
 powerful because it costs 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.610
 understanding of driving will be enough 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.230
 so basically if the car goes wrong is to say that the sale of high school 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.890
 detainees are too hard 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.700
 too hard that means what hardness and maybe 40 or 50 so 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:53.220
 it takes ten thousand adults 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.880
 the longer it lasts 50 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.360
 it's hard said Simon 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.930
 so reduce to the front 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.930
 alas in the back is for tomorrow even if the car 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.050
 everything goes head-to-tail 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.620
 regularly it's clear galley it runs and back are produce 

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.480
 so by yvan muller a little bit more 

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:10.680
 in general the 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.640
 Ideally 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.630
 the start 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.240
 it's 30 40 up front and% 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.840
 and then we employees 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.900
 and then when we get stronger 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.280
 the north tower the same rear train that must send the power through 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.500
 but it will be necessary to put to the amended 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.760
 so that the work can lead anyway 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.760
 and already pat o'may that way before 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.320
 find the right thematic compromise 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.980
 rp a lot of tracks 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.820
 and then 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.060
 driving and behind it's 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.080
 more powerful this level 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.080
 a desire to young people 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.080
 rolling t carbon dacic it's 10 to 62 psion 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.690
 but after train debates departures 4 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.470
 find the site wikileaks 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:03.470
 the goal on the track on which it turns either 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.360
 and a good understanding of a few nights you have to put 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.309
 depending on the coating 

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:13.309
 more efficient possible 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.699
 once you have bought a vote not prompted to contact me the world 

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:20.019
 following report 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:22.310
 in addition to its appearance in question though more suitable
