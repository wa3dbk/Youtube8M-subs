so they're staying in games and when you

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.250 
so they're staying in games and when you
look<00:02:17.680> at<00:02:17.770> the<00:02:17.860> data<00:02:18.130> Chuck<00:02:19.090> covered<00:02:19.540> the

advantage that they're going to have
which<00:02:23.980> is<00:02:24.010> obvious<00:02:24.700> but<00:02:25.420> even<00:02:25.660> when<00:02:25.720> you<00:02:25.840> look

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
which is obvious but even when you look

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.110 
which is obvious but even when you look
at<00:02:26.080> the<00:02:26.170> data<00:02:26.410> here's<00:02:27.010> a<00:02:27.100> Cleveland<00:02:27.670> team<00:02:27.910> that

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
want to point out number one when when

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.100 
want to point out number one when when
you<00:03:18.459> have<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.700> tragedy<00:03:19.239> like<00:03:19.269> that<00:03:19.450> often<00:03:20.079> times

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
you have a tragedy like that often times

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.050 
you have a tragedy like that often times
before<00:03:20.709> you<00:03:20.769> have<00:03:20.950> really<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.310> chance<00:03:21.850> to

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
before you have really a chance to

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300 
before you have really a chance to
figure<00:03:22.480> out<00:03:22.630> of<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.930> you<00:03:23.260> can<00:03:23.470> come<00:03:24.130> together

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
figure out of it you can come together

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.699 
figure out of it you can come together
in<00:03:24.700> jail<00:03:24.940> are<00:03:25.150> the<00:03:25.360> troops<00:03:25.630> yes<00:03:26.170> and<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.470> think

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:26.709 
in jail are the troops yes and I think

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:28.890 
in jail are the troops yes and I think
that's<00:03:26.860> exactly<00:03:26.980> what<00:03:27.519> Kansas<00:03:27.760> II<00:03:28.000> did<00:03:28.269> now

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
that's exactly what Kansas II did now

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.080 
that's exactly what Kansas II did now
you<00:03:28.959> go<00:03:29.590> on<00:03:29.620> the<00:03:30.070> road<00:03:30.310> I<00:03:30.340> think<00:03:30.519> that<00:03:30.790> makes<00:03:30.970> a

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
you go on the road I think that makes a

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.850 
you go on the road I think that makes a
big<00:03:31.360> difference<00:03:31.390> I<00:03:31.989> think<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:32.350> makes<00:03:32.530> a<00:03:32.650> huge

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
big difference I think that makes a huge

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.680 
big difference I think that makes a huge
difference<00:03:33.130> in<00:03:33.400> your<00:03:33.519> home<00:03:33.850> still<00:03:34.450> wouldn't

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
difference in your home still wouldn't

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.940 
difference in your home still wouldn't
like<00:03:34.840> them<00:03:35.019> but<00:03:35.140> I<00:03:35.230> think<00:03:35.410> on<00:03:35.530> the<00:03:35.620> road<00:03:35.799> that

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
like them but I think on the road that

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.710 
like them but I think on the road that
makes<00:03:36.130> it<00:03:36.220> even<00:03:36.370> tougher<00:03:36.489> during<00:03:37.360> the<00:03:37.450> course

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
makes it even tougher during the course

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.690 
makes it even tougher during the course
of<00:03:37.840> the<00:03:37.930> week<00:03:38.140> this<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.950> where<00:03:39.160> it<00:03:39.280> matters

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
of the week this is where it matters

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.430 
of the week this is where it matters
because<00:03:39.850> when<00:03:40.150> you<00:03:40.239> take<00:03:40.480> the<00:03:40.630> fields<00:03:41.079> and<00:03:41.200> a

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
because when you take the fields and a

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.650 
because when you take the fields and a
pro<00:03:41.680> athlete<00:03:41.920> you<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:43.060> are<00:03:43.269> going<00:03:43.420> to<00:03:43.510> give<00:03:43.630> a

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
hundred percent on every play it's just

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:46.710 
hundred percent on every play it's just
the<00:03:45.250> nature<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.609> the<00:03:45.700> beast<00:03:45.880> but<00:03:46.450> it's<00:03:46.600> the

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
the nature of the beast but it's the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.780 
the nature of the beast but it's the
preparation<00:03:47.560> yeah<00:03:47.890> during<00:03:48.190> the<00:03:48.280> course<00:03:48.579> three

00:04:08.009 --> 00:04:08.019 
professional athlete it's just at the

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.259 
professional athlete it's just at the
end<00:04:08.140> of<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.320> day<00:04:08.500> it's<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.769> the<00:04:09.190> game<00:04:09.370> that's

00:04:10.259 --> 00:04:10.269 
end of the day it's just the game that's

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:12.060 
end of the day it's just the game that's
that's<00:04:10.720> it<00:04:10.959> and<00:04:11.140> when<00:04:11.620> something<00:04:11.799> like<00:04:12.040> this

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
that's it and when something like this

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:14.230 
happens a tragedy like this I think

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:16.770 
happens a tragedy like this I think
that's<00:04:14.410> when<00:04:14.680> as<00:04:14.829> a<00:04:14.859> human<00:04:15.280> being<00:04:15.459> you<00:04:16.299> realize

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
that's when as a human being you realize

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:18.990 
that's when as a human being you realize
that<00:04:16.810> it's<00:04:17.289> just<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.769> game<00:04:17.950> right<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:18.640> and

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:19.000 
that it's just the game right like and

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.880 
that it's just the game right like and
when<00:04:19.150> you<00:04:19.269> come<00:04:19.810> to<00:04:19.930> that<00:04:20.019> conclusion<00:04:20.079> does<00:04:20.709> it

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
when you come to that conclusion does it

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.219 
when you come to that conclusion does it
really<00:04:21.070> matter<00:04:21.400> that<00:04:21.609> much<00:04:21.820> it's<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.810> hard<00:04:23.110> to

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
really matter that much it's so hard to

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.440 
really matter that much it's so hard to
then<00:04:23.530> get<00:04:23.830> up<00:04:23.890> and<00:04:24.159> go<00:04:24.370> play<00:04:24.729> right
