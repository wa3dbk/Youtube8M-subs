00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.900
 let's hunt because 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.929
 big and big woodcock because the 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.100
 roughly a little drawer I would say 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:24.200
 what launch we say not a proposal 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:27.450
 the application launched 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:31.350
 we say that I would say to go hunting 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:37.640
 to the migratory game with the 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:44.190
 28 caliber with the 400 being a thing 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:49.739
 they made us fall these yes 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.260
 would be more right but because maybe from 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.370
 always in China and settled it could be 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.380
 go also central pro12 ok la 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.260
 game settled to rule you can 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.810
 put gender 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.150
 I see it run 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:11.190
 the woodcocks are strong 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:14.940
 then it would be exaggerated 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:17.370
 let's say he would come by and watch 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.750
 the same 

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.750
 hello relationship with space 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.450
 rivals 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.450
 single 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.250
 16 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.280
 or 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.950
 just 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.550
 to do 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.740
 this 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:39.720
 if to reason above the expression 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.720
 more places the move no 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.490
 tonight 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:54.070
 we see 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:54.070
 and this allows the child to live bingo 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.240
 let's see if we can do some action 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:02.360
 of quail hunting and beautiful we do 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.360
 to see
