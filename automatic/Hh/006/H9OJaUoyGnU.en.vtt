00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:02.119 

our<00:00:00.480> first<00:00:00.840> technique<00:00:01.140> is<00:00:01.589> going<00:00:01.770> to<00:00:01.860> be<00:00:02.100> a

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
our first technique is going to be a

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.650 
our first technique is going to be a
basic<00:00:02.939> three<00:00:03.419> strand<00:00:03.780> braid<00:00:04.970> you<00:00:05.970> can<00:00:06.000> do<00:00:06.390> this

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
basic three strand braid you can do this

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.140 
basic three strand braid you can do this
with<00:00:07.170> any<00:00:07.410> party<00:00:07.919> size<00:00:08.220> a<00:00:09.090> whole<00:00:09.750> head<00:00:10.650> of<00:00:10.679> hair

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.150 
with any party size a whole head of hair

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:16.939 
with any party size a whole head of hair
whatever<00:00:12.559> we<00:00:13.559> are<00:00:13.590> going<00:00:14.099> to<00:00:14.370> first<00:00:15.289> break<00:00:16.289> the

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
whatever we are going to first break the

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.279 
whatever we are going to first break the
section<00:00:17.520> down<00:00:18.390> into<00:00:19.340> three<00:00:21.289> individual

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
section down into three individual

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.320 
section down into three individual
parties<00:00:23.269> like<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> techniques<00:00:27.210> of

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
parties like so the techniques of

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.650 
parties like so the techniques of
braiding<00:00:27.810> is<00:00:28.010> crossing<00:00:29.010> each<00:00:29.490> side<00:00:29.939> to<00:00:30.480> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
braiding is crossing each side to the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.110 
braiding is crossing each side to the
middle<00:00:31.099> so<00:00:32.099> what<00:00:32.279> we're<00:00:32.369> going<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.520> do<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.880> take

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
middle so what we're going to do is take

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.790 
middle so what we're going to do is take
the<00:00:34.110> right<00:00:34.410> side<00:00:34.910> right<00:00:35.910> here<00:00:36.440> we're<00:00:37.440> going<00:00:37.649> to

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
the right side right here we're going to

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.610 
the right side right here we're going to
hold<00:00:38.430> all<00:00:38.730> three<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.420> our<00:00:39.750> fingers<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.410> this

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
hold all three and our fingers like this

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
hold all three and our fingers like this
we're<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.370> take<00:00:41.640> this<00:00:41.850> right<00:00:42.210> one<00:00:42.480> cross

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
we're going to take this right one cross

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
we're going to take this right one cross
over<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:44.070> middle<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.579> take<00:00:45.030> it<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.480> the

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
over the middle and take it to the

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.520 
over the middle and take it to the
middle<00:00:46.820> next<00:00:47.820> we're<00:00:48.270> going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> grab<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.260> left

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
middle next we're going to grab the left

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.220 
middle next we're going to grab the left
side<00:00:51.260> cross<00:00:52.260> it<00:00:52.530> over<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.600> bring<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
side cross it over and bring it to the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.770 
side cross it over and bring it to the
middle<00:00:55.469> while<00:00:55.890> bringing<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.820> middle<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.570> that

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
middle while bringing the middle to that

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.700 
middle while bringing the middle to that
side<00:00:58.079> so<00:00:58.489> basically<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.789> we're<00:00:59.969> doing<00:01:00.000> is

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
side so basically what we're doing is

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.100 
side so basically what we're doing is
we're<00:01:01.710> taking<00:01:01.789> the<00:01:02.789> side<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:03.539> bringing<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.080> to

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
we're taking the side and bringing it to

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.230 
we're taking the side and bringing it to
the<00:01:04.260> middle<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.070> middle<00:01:05.100> bringing<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
the middle in the middle bringing it to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.100 
the middle in the middle bringing it to
that<00:01:06.420> side<00:01:07.280> taking<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.670> side<00:01:08.960> bringing<00:01:09.960> it

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that side taking this side bringing it

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.770 
that side taking this side bringing it
to<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.979> middle<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.549> taking<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.360> one<00:01:12.540> to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
to the middle and taking that one to

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.789 
to the middle and taking that one to
that<00:01:12.960> side<00:01:13.229> so<00:01:14.180> you're<00:01:15.180> gonna<00:01:15.299> wrap<00:01:15.540> over<00:01:15.810> to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
that side so you're gonna wrap over to

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:23.539 
that side so you're gonna wrap over to
the<00:01:16.950> middle<00:01:17.250> over<00:01:19.670> to<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.820> middle<00:01:21.860> right<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
the middle over to the middle right to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.020 
the middle over to the middle right to
the<00:01:23.670> middle<00:01:23.909> left<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.619> middle<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.070> you're

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
the middle left to the middle and you're

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.630 
the middle left to the middle and you're
constantly<00:01:27.509> moving<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.380> middle<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.430> either

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
constantly moving the middle to either

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.330 
constantly moving the middle to either
side<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:31.070> that<00:01:32.070> side<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.659> side<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.340> that's

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
side to that side to that side so that's

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.090 
side to that side to that side so that's
alright<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.780> that's<00:01:37.020> art<00:01:37.259> that's<00:01:38.360> art<00:01:39.360> that's

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
you can do the exact same braid

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:33.479 
you can do the exact same braid
underhand<00:02:29.170> it<00:02:30.239> take<00:02:31.239> another<00:02:31.510> party<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.489> like

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
underhand it take another party I like

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.399 
underhand it take another party I like
to<00:02:33.640> do<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.819> see<00:02:34.150> shaping<00:02:34.659> because<00:02:34.959> it's<00:02:35.170> easy

00:02:35.399 --> 00:02:35.409 
to do a see shaping because it's easy

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.399 
to do a see shaping because it's easy
and<00:02:35.970> pretty<00:02:36.970> it<00:02:37.209> stays<00:02:37.450> pretty<00:02:37.810> much<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.200> same

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
and pretty it stays pretty much the same

and pretty it stays pretty much the same
you<00:02:38.620> can<00:02:38.739> get<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> pretty<00:02:39.459> even<00:02:40.090> look<00:02:40.569> all<00:02:40.780> over

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
you can get a pretty even look all over

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.059 
you can get a pretty even look all over
once<00:02:41.950> again<00:02:42.310> you<00:02:43.000> want<00:02:43.120> to<00:02:43.209> divide<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:44.079> into

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
once again you want to divide it into

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:48.750 
once again you want to divide it into
three<00:02:45.519> sections<00:02:45.790> one<00:02:46.750> two<00:02:46.930> three<00:02:47.349> and<00:02:47.760> instead

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
three sections one two three and instead

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.240 
three sections one two three and instead
of<00:02:48.819> going<00:02:49.090> over<00:02:49.810> to<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.650> middle<00:02:50.950> you're<00:02:51.099> gonna

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
of going over to the middle you're gonna

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.750
