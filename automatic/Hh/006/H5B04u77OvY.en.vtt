00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.480

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.960
 invitation thank the This shot 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.220
 has made possible and how they 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.640
 tell you now time to what a 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:35.829
 vehicle acts and that is audi r8 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:40.629
 year 2010 v8 engine 4.2 liter displacement and 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:45.339
 As of 2010, the r8 has 430 hp with the v8 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:49.870
 ten ps more if you hear it or not 

00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:49.870
 convince even to the soundcheck 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.859
 u 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.140
 u 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:36.300
 So for an audi in no case 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.740
 I also think that love is so correct 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.110
 That was the usual soundcheck 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.820
 Procedure that recognizes what happens when 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.509
 to get an audi a8 via launch control from 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.530
 the chain leaves 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.530
 that looks now 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:48.360
 that's the heart in any case so 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:58.490
 play with it so be curious 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.490
