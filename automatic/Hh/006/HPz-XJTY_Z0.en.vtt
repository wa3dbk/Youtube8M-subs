probably in your downloads go ahead and
flash<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.960> then<00:01:13.260> next<00:01:13.409> flash<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:14.040> g

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
flash that and then next flash the g

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.870 
flash that and then next flash the g
amps<00:01:14.930> so<00:01:15.930> this<00:01:16.080> does<00:01:16.290> take<00:01:16.860> quite<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.549> a

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
amps so this does take quite a bit of a

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
amps so this does take quite a bit of a
time<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.630> i'm<00:01:18.750> going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.049> ahead<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.229> edit

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
time so i'm going to go ahead and edit

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.050 
time so i'm going to go ahead and edit
some<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.920> sound<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.340> way<00:01:20.520> doesn't<00:01:20.790> take

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
some of the sound that way doesn't take

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.420 
some of the sound that way doesn't take
forever<00:01:21.259> so<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.380> next<00:01:22.530> step<00:01:22.710> is<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.070> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
forever so the next step is just to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.340 
forever so the next step is just to
reboot<00:01:23.909> your<00:01:23.970> Nexus<00:01:24.390> 7<00:01:24.750> and<00:01:24.840> you'll<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.170> this
