 festival that says festival says gold like 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.399
 coach is there so cheap and even if 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:00.680
 coach is there it was there are several 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.600
 month I wanted to inspire myself for 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.960
 make this video and we will start with 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.960
 the looks 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.850
 gold for these make up a little a lot or 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.250
 enia if you prefer I do not know 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
 why I wanted a colorful smoky so 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.820
 for that I will start of course by 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.530
 my complexion with as always my kohler 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.630
 steve de revlon that I apply to audois 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.280
 I then use the chocolate embroiderer 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.260
 sun of all done to cross my 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.490
 days then the embroiderer wants neither on 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.470
 the whole face because it's a 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.450
 iridescent powder that gives a small effect 

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.100
 tanned and ideal glory for the summer 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.410
 during this word that I'm going to leave on a 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.300
 cac who with the color kajal number 1 of 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:35.080
 givenchy that I spread over all my 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.690
 mobile eyelid 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.580
 I then come down with a cac 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.800
 darker on the outside of the eye in 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.850
 smoking it with a brush I use a strand 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.660
 under the eye I have grades 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.660
 Will it 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.409
 and 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.880
 to intensify the japy look that a 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.840
 black pencil on the mucous membrane to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.610
 inside the eye 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.770
 I put a layer of mascara better 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.360
 than the soul faith for the lips I 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.250
 will stay at select not to over 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.409
 swear with the eyes and so I use the 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.110
 lips contour lip liner number 2 of 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.660
 givenchy then people filled with red 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.280
 Beige beige feather lipstick also I 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.050
 put a touch of Calvin's sugar gloss 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.050
 klein for a little shine and has 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.370
 finished with makeup the hairstyles 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.530
 I will start by doing a line on 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.730
 the side then with the side where I have the 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.890
 more hair I'm going to attack a 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.900
 latte in team and I know by then my 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.430
 two-part hair is frozen to 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.140
 every time take a strand of 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.120
 the outside of the first part that I 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.300
 will go inside the second 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.300
 part 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.020
 I do the same thing on the other side I 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.550
 do everything to keep the mat close 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.410
 of my face by bringing back the most 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.970
 often the wicks from the back to the 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.860
 sale which gives more movements to 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.080
 the mat in addition to that no need to 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.880
 greenhouse and keep a latte loose enough 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.740
 once I arrived down I 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.240
 fix everything with a rubber band 

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:02.040
 now we can either leave our 

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.130
 hairstyle like that be add a raid 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.780
 but I chose the iron or the first 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.640
 wolf I chose a look very seen at 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.680
 the coach is where I love so I 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.900
 put on some dark blue denim shorts 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.190
 pierced a black lace top with a 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.709
 bra underneath to hide when 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.480
 even a minimum and of course the piece 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.680
 part of the outfit is the kimono 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.959
 find more and more easily in 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.040
 store but that's it does not dare and 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.970
 that we would show how to do it in 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.650
 the next video 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.880
 I just love it because it complements 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.950
 really an outfit giving him this 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.450
 class-m aspect super stylish and very very 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.280
 laid back I put spartan 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.930
 rising dark red to dress the 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.310
 lower leg and I associate them with 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.080
 a red belt for the recall of 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.030
 color a pretty gem of a head for 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.950
 dress the hair and the forehead and I 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.870
 put the golden tattoo blind that is 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.459
 the trend of this summer is beautiful 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.720
 stylish it's easy to put and it's 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.010
 found in all the stores of 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.330
 clothes and accessories and it stays 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:50.280
 a few days still good it's not 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:51.840
 bad for that second look that is for 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 the shot rather an evening look or 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.830
 really fuse tickets I chose 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:57.900
 a black tube skirt that is quite long 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.280
 not to make vulgar a croc top 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.840
 bra to give the touch of 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.850
 color and make the thundering phone 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.140
 the remaining high waist skirt allows 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.360
 not to reveal too much the belly and 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.739
 so to stay pretty classy my huge 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.239
 blow of heart on this outfit is the 

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:11.010
 big ethnic necklace it's your ball a 

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.140
 held instantly and limit we see 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:14.519
 that and I love shoes 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.900
 I used a pair of shoes 

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:18.269
 open reminiscent of the top motives 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.859
 and which allows to launch the silhouette 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.989
 I also matched the outfit with a 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.819
 small green bag with python patterns too much 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.110
 cute and I kept my golden tattoos 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:26.659
 because they go with everything and because 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.680
 I just love them 

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:30.330
 now we are going to go on nail art 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:32.220
 by making orange and blue bases 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:33.780
 then using a very fine brush 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.580
 we will form small triangles with 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.919
 an intense black polish starting from the 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.210
 edge of your fingernail inward there 

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.650
 must be careful and take his 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.090
 time not to miss everything but 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.039
 promised it's feasible and higher 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.900
 result and hop is completely at the 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:48.000
 fashion is now starting on the 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:50.069
 gi's with a stylized ben raid and a 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.240
 accessories that absolutely everyone 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:53.240
 can do both 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.270
 for 10 years and we will start with 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.860
 arcana ben simple archi and we're going 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:01.050
 just need some 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.370
 zigzags the color of your hair and 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.449
 golden and silver chains 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.009
 we'll do something 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:06.840
 extremely complicated ie 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:08.039
 that we are going to tie different lengths of 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.689
 chains on each zigzag 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:11.069
 that's all you can do 

00:05:09.689 --> 00:05:12.360
 secure the string nodes with 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.979
 the superglue to prevent it from happening 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.900
 detach too fast too and you do not have 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:17.400
 more than placing the fbi in the back of 

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.319
 your head without even needing to 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:20.639
 tie it to the front and chains go 

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.259
 blend in your hair while 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.949
 naturally and give plenty of 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:26.759
 reflect this initial purpose 

00:05:24.949 --> 00:05:28.259
 now go not something pretty 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:30.240
 original that is to say that we will make a 

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:31.650
 call fringes with just a tee 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.669
 shirt of the color of your choice and 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.289
 a pair of scissors 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:35.759
 you start by folding t-shirts into 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.870
 two in the direction of the length for the 

00:05:35.759 --> 00:05:37.439
 first cut so that it is well 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:39.180
 right 

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:40.650
 then you leave this cut and 

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:42.719
 you make equal bands of each 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.400
 side you continue by cutting the 

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:46.379
 sewing the bat on each band then 

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.210
 the entire back of the t-shirt along the collar 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.900
 to simply keep the neck around and 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.490
 the fringes 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.080
 you just have to put it on 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.029
 top of a top to give an appearance 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.439
 more bohemian and unstructured to an outfit 

00:05:54.029 --> 00:05:57.569
 and as I think it's better with 

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:59.159
 a vespa on it I put a throat 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.839
 and I just love results and 

00:05:59.159 --> 00:06:02.849
 we can not do more simple 

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:04.560
 the man says to irin and here is this video 

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:06.509
 is now over of course the following 

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:07.319
 gi's on the theme was coming 

00:06:06.509 --> 00:06:09.900
 in two weeks 

00:06:07.319 --> 00:06:12.470
 you take no vacation my powder she 

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:13.640
 is involved in the ice rink 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.510
 and I will send you back very soon 

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:16.510
 go
