00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:13.680
 Then the other day it was issued by Barnes 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.680
 5.25 seconds Moody Kyun will continue to the subsequent description of the single-shot world record 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:28.170
 Since the rotation hope of the scramble and the alignment is published in the whole video loading , there too 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.170
 Please check 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:37.940
 If you look at the scrambled state, the white cross is first green and one dick is already in place 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.540
 English range also states it 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.670
 It state to say that Anne or 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.670
 Located in the red also called around and position 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.100
 At first we arrange orange and blue at first from here 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.490
 And 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.550
 Akao 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:03.980
 Move the squadron that uses the trigger 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:05.260
 Furthermore d Tsu This double trigger of bit right hand ring finger little finger faded double tree aligned 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.200
 Using 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.159
 management 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.159
 We have a center 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.360
 And s team one eye 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 This is also in front of you 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.260
 Probably noticed in the middle of arranging Macross or 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:25.810
 It might have been read at the time of inspection 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.810
 Music accompanied the export of this person one eye 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.210
 Specify align and a is also the following two pair of eyes 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.980
 Are you here 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.100
 Kuju 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:44.250
 Align orange green 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:49.340
 And at that time, the third green-red pair is also in my eyes 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:55.450
 I'm going to go with this as it enters my mind 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:56.580
 And at this time , the red and blue thighs are also visible here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.900
 this 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:05.890
 9 while watching 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:09.810
 Here is a nice shape when aligning red and green 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.810
 You can put it as it is 

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:14.880
 And 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.830
 I 'm going to put in 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.319
 In fact each used procedure probably uses a technique called ol ct 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.290
 I am 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:31.790
 It's not only just putting in a row but it's good to have it together 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.790
 I 'm probably using the procedure of aligning the corner locations together 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:39.230
 This technique is made possible by remembering and using multiple steps against one Ellen 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.230
 Become 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.420
 From this state 

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:54.500
 This is complete 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:03:02.020
 When finished, corner alignment is complete and the edge is skipped 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:02.020
 I think it is finished with this because it is finished in the state without ef famous alignment
