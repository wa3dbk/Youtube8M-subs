00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
very effective right out of the box a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.030 
very effective right out of the box a
little<00:02:03.450> bit<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.750> adjustment<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.440> this<00:02:04.800> thing

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
little bit of adjustment and this thing

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.580
