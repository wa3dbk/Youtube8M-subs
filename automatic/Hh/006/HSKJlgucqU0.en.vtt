like compensation and it's clear that

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.330 
like compensation and it's clear that
the<00:03:55.329> son<00:03:55.630> would<00:03:55.840> cripple<00:03:56.260> the<00:03:56.650> country<00:03:57.040> itself

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.650 
time of 6.6 billion pounds and many
historians<00:04:12.250> estimate<00:04:12.609> that<00:04:12.910> this<00:04:13.239> could<00:04:13.480> be

and fifty billion pounds now this was a

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.390 
and fifty billion pounds now this was a
massive<00:04:19.870> sum<00:04:20.320> and<00:04:20.500> this<00:04:20.889> is<00:04:21.039> key<00:04:21.370> to

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
massive sum and this is key to

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.730 
massive sum and this is key to
