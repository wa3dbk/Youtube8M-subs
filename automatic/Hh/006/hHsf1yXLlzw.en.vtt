00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 all right 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.800
 Welcome to online drawing 

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.559
 we have previously drawn views 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.390
 how are you walking and in 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.010
 three-quarter views 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.380
 today we will draw a girl in view of 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.359
 profile with a slightly aerial view 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.829
 For this we remember some very 

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.340
 important that before we 

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.399
 spoken we draw for it an ellipse to 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.579
 from which we draw a cylinder 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:32.290
 and in the same way we draw another cylinder 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:34.360
 only now we draw it in a view 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.829
 inverse of the previous one remember 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.159
 practice the drawing of the figures 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:41.379
 basic geometric how are you at the first 

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:43.300
 we divide it in half and 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:46.090
 about it we draw reference lines 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.400
 that follow the curved shape of the cylinder 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:51.250
 the second cylinder we divide it not to the 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.989
 half but a little towards the shore and 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.880
 then we draw the same lines of 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.840
 reference on the cylinder that follows 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.520
 in its curved form 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.380
 we go back to the first cylinder and 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.990
 following the direction of the lines of 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:05.210
 reference we draw the eyes and the nose 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:07.850
 it's a triangle that points down 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.620
 the mouth also follows the curved shape of the 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.050
 cylinder as if they are laughing 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.840
 finally we draw a general form of 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.880
 the head around the cylinder 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 looking to draw the thin chin and a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.289
 ear 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.600
 in the second following we do the same 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:25.880
 now the eyes and eyebrows that we draw 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:28.340
 they have a curved shape opposite to that of 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.159
 another cylinder the triangle of the nose 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.610
 now it points up and the curvature 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.479
 of the mouth is as if it were sad 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.130
 again we follow the form of 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.979
 cylinder to draw a face that 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.899
 flip up these faces the 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:45.330
 we have explained in more detail in classes 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:47.700
 earlier this is just a brief review 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:50.640
 but we will draw a series of foundations 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.640
 to sketch a girl a cylinder 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.770
 for the other neck for the body two 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.620
 very thin for the legs and others 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.300
 for the arms as we discussed is very 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.090
 important to know how to draw figures 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.770
 geometric to improve your drawing maybe 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 at the beginning the geometric figures 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.690
 they get in the way but little by little you will see that they are 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.180
 of great help we draw references in 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:14.550
 the face and based on these we detail 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.200
 the face and we draw clothes and others 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.870
 details that require the curvature of 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:21.000
 cylinders the reason why we explain 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.380
 these things is because in the drawing that 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.030
 we will do today it will be better that we are 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.760
 familiar with the drawing of 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.070
 elements on a curved surface like 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.990
 in a cylinder the reference lines 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.780
 curves help us to better understand the 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.000
 three-dimensional shapes in the drawing 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.700
 after so much preamble let's draw the 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.410
 girl profile in principle as 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.290
 important is knowing that the legs are 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.230
 draw short we draw two measures 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.840
 same and at the end we add a small 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.670
 section with a dotted line this 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.640
 section is about one third the size 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.350
 of some of the other two sections in 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.200
 this one-third section should fit 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.569
 head and neck we draw a circle that 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.030
 will be the head the neck lightly 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.010
 inclined in the previous class we saw in 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.170
 detail how to draw this head in 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.180
 slightly aerial view 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.700
 on the neck line we draw a 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.470
 curved line up this division is 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.710
 important that you observe as this line 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.380
 part of the neck center 

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:21.020
 now we draw a broken line like 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:23.540
 indicated by the arrow this broken line 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:26.180
 makes contact with the green center line 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.580
 this dotted line indicates the union 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:31.100
 curve between the body case and the box 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:33.410
 of the pelvis or let's say it's the line 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.330
 from the waist starting from the ellipse of 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.880
 the pelvic box we draw a curved line 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:40.910
 that will go to the center line more or 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.650
 minus half of this section pasted 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.260
 to the central line we draw a line 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.330
 dotted that will be the pimple 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.849
 on the other side of the leg we draw 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:52.180
 a straight line and under this straight line 

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.200
 a curve behind the pimples 

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:57.319
 note that these two lines are 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:04:00.439
 pretty curves and that these two are more 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.870
 or less straight and we draw the foot according to 

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:05.360
 the direction of this arrow 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:07.430
 in this blue line we follow the curvature 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.129
 of the waist and we throw a line 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:12.330
 following this direction we get a 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:14.310
 line pointing up 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.799
 the same address on this date will serve 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.320
 to draw the other foot as 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:20.820
 you can see which neck we draw a 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:23.370
 point that will be the union of 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:25.260
 clavicles we draw a first 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.260
 clavicle and according to the same inclination 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:31.050
 we will trace the second clavicle the end 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:32.520
 of this is inside the head more or 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.650
 less at the point where the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:37.470
 leg we draw a line in dark blue 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.960
 here to get to the doll we draw the 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:42.780
 slightly curved arm from the 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.240
 end point of the clavicle we draw 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.710
 the hand simulating the with an ellipse and 

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:49.170
 according to the same inclination that we have 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.760
 been using we draw the other hand the 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:53.100
 central line of the body part of the 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.880
 union of the clavicles and is lost in 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:58.040
 the front of the body 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.780
 with a curved line we trace the chest 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:02.510
 that follows the direction of the line 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:04.520
 inclined blue that we previously placed as 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.340
 you can see both breasts are visible in 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 this inclination we draw some lines 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:11.360
 that give us an idea of ​​the point where 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:14.000
 begins the leg and we mark the 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.070
 gluteus we draw the knee and very 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.650
 important we draw the other shoulder that 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.139
 already touches part of the chin 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.759
 we trace the face quickly because as 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.420
 we discussed it we saw it in the class 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.490
 previous 

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:28.560
 around the whole body we draw 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.120
 curved reference lines like those 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:32.760
 we draw in the introduction of this 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.740
 class as we discuss these lines 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.570
 curves give us a more correct idea of 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.540
 the three-dimensional shape of the body in 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:42.120
 this slightly elevated view we give a 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.370
 most definitive way to shoulder arm and 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.990
 forearm as we saw it in a class 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:48.040
 previous as it appears on the screen here 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.320
 in the description of this video 

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:53.320
 we practically finished this drawing 

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:55.510
 it only remains to detail the lack of following the 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:57.790
 curved shape with which we aim at all 

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:59.530
 the body following the dotted line 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:06:01.680
 we draw a line that breaks 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:04.240
 simulating the movement of the fabric 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.220
 we attach the dress to the waist and 

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:08.800
 we add other details in the part of 

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.140
 above the dress we also draw a 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.420
 Basic shape of hair shoes and 

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.790
 some folds in the clothes 

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:17.500
 this is today's class but as 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:19.840
 always for you to see the potential of 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.480
 this stroke that we made quickly and 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.340
 we will see a little picture using our 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:26.310
 a thinner line and with our 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:28.590
 best possible pulse 

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:31.290
 when you draw you can do it with a 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:32.940
 unconcerned pulse but when the 

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:36.480
 time to paint we do it with enough 

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:39.300
 cleaning we add color which each time 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.890
 have more details we hope as 

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.590
 always this class motivates you to follow 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.240
 drawing though although these views are 

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.210
 a little more difficult with some 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:49.860
 practice you can draw them if you liked 

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:51.690
 the class do not stop sharing it 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.840
 comment and if you still do not follow us 

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:57.290
 subscribe will not be of much help until 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.290
 the next
