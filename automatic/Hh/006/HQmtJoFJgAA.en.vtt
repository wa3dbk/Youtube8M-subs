00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
white clothing everything I think you'll

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.089 
white clothing everything I think you'll
see<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.950> pretty<00:02:50.629> pretty<00:02:51.629> much<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:51.930> black<00:02:52.170> or

00:02:53.089 --> 00:02:53.099 
see is pretty pretty much just black or

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:55.490 
see is pretty pretty much just black or
very<00:02:53.160> dark<00:02:53.640> shades<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.900> really<00:02:55.319> really

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
very dark shades and so I really really

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.050 
very dark shades and so I really really
like<00:02:55.650> this<00:02:55.680> and<00:02:56.129> the<00:02:56.579> annoying<00:02:56.790> thing<00:02:56.910> is<00:02:57.030> it

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
like this and the annoying thing is it

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.610 
like this and the annoying thing is it
is<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.390> bit<00:02:57.660> too<00:02:57.810> big<00:02:57.959> so<00:02:58.140> I'm<00:02:58.260> probably<00:02:58.410> gonna

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
is a bit too big so I'm probably gonna

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.500 
is a bit too big so I'm probably gonna
have<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:58.799> sort<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.099> size<00:02:59.280> and<00:02:59.579> I<00:02:59.640> just<00:03:00.329> thought

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
have to sort the size and I just thought

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:01.460 
have to sort the size and I just thought
you'd<00:03:00.660> really<00:03:00.840> nice<00:03:01.019> and<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:01.230> can<00:03:01.349> actually
