00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
on using Microsoft Remote Desktop to

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.309 
on using Microsoft Remote Desktop to
connect<00:00:06.060> from<00:00:06.240> one<00:00:06.509> to<00:00:06.779> another<00:00:06.930> computer

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
connect from one to another computer

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:09.950 
connect from one to another computer
it's<00:00:08.099> very<00:00:08.189> simple<00:00:08.420> basically<00:00:09.420> we<00:00:09.510> have<00:00:09.540> this

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
it's very simple basically we have this

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.190 
it's very simple basically we have this
windows<00:00:10.349> 7<00:00:10.650> machine<00:00:10.679> here<00:00:11.630> that<00:00:12.630> we<00:00:12.750> will<00:00:12.990> want

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
windows 7 machine here that we will want

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
windows 7 machine here that we will want
to<00:00:13.380> connect<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.070> this<00:00:14.280> other<00:00:14.549> windows<00:00:14.969> 7

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
to connect to this other windows 7

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.290 
to connect to this other windows 7
machine<00:00:15.330> and<00:00:15.870> connect<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.260> to<00:00:16.410> their<00:00:16.560> desktop

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:17.300 
machine and connect on to their desktop

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.480 
machine and connect on to their desktop
so<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.390> requirements<00:00:18.869> on<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.710> server

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
so the requirements on the server

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.390 
so the requirements on the server
machine<00:00:20.730> if<00:00:21.119> you<00:00:21.180> will<00:00:21.630> the<00:00:22.500> machine<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.100> want

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
machine if you will the machine you want

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.380 
machine if you will the machine you want
to<00:00:23.609> connect<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.210> there<00:00:24.869> has<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.199> be<00:00:25.230> an<00:00:25.380> account

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
to connect to there has to be an account

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.720 
to connect to there has to be an account
that<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.660> password<00:00:28.230> protected<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.980> what<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.580> did

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
that is password protected so what I did

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.580 
that is password protected so what I did
I<00:00:29.789> went<00:00:29.910> ahead<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.150> created<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.840> testy<00:00:31.349> user

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590

with<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> password<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:33.000> tests<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:34.550> created<00:00:35.550> him

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
with a password of tests and created him

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.580 
with a password of tests and created him
there<00:00:36.030> separate<00:00:36.630> as<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.020> can<00:00:37.200> see<00:00:37.410> I've<00:00:37.559> got

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
one we're connecting from will work you

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
one we're connecting from will work you
can<00:01:39.000> also<00:01:39.119> narrow<00:01:39.540> it<00:01:39.810> down<00:01:39.840> to<00:01:40.909> two<00:01:41.909> only<00:01:42.750> you

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
can also narrow it down to two only you

can also narrow it down to two only you
know<00:01:43.860> using<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.549> higher<00:01:44.700> authentication<00:01:45.240> down

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
know using a higher authentication down

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.020 
know using a higher authentication down
here<00:01:45.869> so<00:01:46.140> i<00:01:46.950> always<00:01:47.250> use<00:01:47.520> the<00:01:47.549> middle<00:01:47.880> one

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

remotely<00:04:15.600> you'll<00:04:16.109> see<00:04:16.260> this<00:04:16.380> little<00:04:16.560> bar<00:04:16.829> up

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
remotely you'll see this little bar up

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.879 
remotely you'll see this little bar up
at<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.430> top<00:04:17.959> giving<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.079> the<00:04:19.199> IP<00:04:19.380> I

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
at the top giving you the IP I

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.159 
at the top giving you the IP I
or<00:04:20.159> host<00:04:20.400> name<00:04:20.639> of<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:21.479> machine<00:04:21.780> that<00:04:21.900> you're

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:22.169 
or host name of the machine that you're

00:04:22.169 --> 00:04:26.089 
or host name of the machine that you're
connected<00:04:22.680> to<00:04:23.659> so<00:04:24.659> this<00:04:24.780> is<00:04:25.050> basically<00:04:25.530> it<00:04:25.979> so

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
connected to so this is basically it so

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:27.320 
connected to so this is basically it so
we<00:04:26.159> can<00:04:26.249> minimize<00:04:26.400> this<00:04:26.819> and<00:04:26.879> we<00:04:27.060> can<00:04:27.180> actually

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330 
we can minimize this and we can actually

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.649 
we can minimize this and we can actually
see<00:04:27.599> both<00:04:27.870> desktops<00:04:28.409> at<00:04:28.620> the<00:04:28.680> same<00:04:28.919> time<00:04:29.659> this

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
see both desktops at the same time this

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:33.320 
see both desktops at the same time this
is<00:04:30.870> it's<00:04:31.740> pretty<00:04:31.949> helpful<00:04:32.249> especially<00:04:32.520> if<00:04:33.060> you

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:33.330 
is it's pretty helpful especially if you

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:35.719 
is it's pretty helpful especially if you
working<00:04:33.870> remotely<00:04:34.319> or<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:34.830> you<00:04:35.129> have<00:04:35.249> a<00:04:35.310> server

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
working remotely or if you have a server

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.550 
working remotely or if you have a server
that<00:04:35.909> you<00:04:36.180> need<00:04:36.479> to<00:04:36.569> connect<00:04:36.870> to<00:04:37.020> and<00:04:37.259> work<00:04:37.409> on

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
that you need to connect to and work on

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.890 
that you need to connect to and work on
and<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:37.999> let's<00:04:38.999> go<00:04:39.090> ahead<00:04:39.120> and<00:04:39.240> close<00:04:39.509> this<00:04:39.569> so

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:39.900 
and so let's go ahead and close this so

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.649 
and so let's go ahead and close this so
there's<00:04:40.050> another<00:04:40.259> thing<00:04:40.499> i<00:04:40.590> want<00:04:40.800> to<00:04:40.860> show<00:04:40.949> you

00:04:41.649 --> 00:04:41.659 
there's another thing i want to show you

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.619 
there's another thing i want to show you
there's<00:04:42.659> more<00:04:42.840> advanced<00:04:43.199> settings<00:04:43.710> we<00:04:43.949> can<00:04:44.249> do

00:04:44.619 --> 00:04:44.629 
there's more advanced settings we can do

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:46.939 
there's more advanced settings we can do
so<00:04:45.629> let's<00:04:45.779> go<00:04:45.900> back<00:04:46.020> into<00:04:46.139> the<00:04:46.259> remote<00:04:46.379> desktop

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
so let's go back into the remote desktop

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:50.869 
so let's go back into the remote desktop
let's<00:04:47.310> hit<00:04:47.460> options<00:04:48.120> here<00:04:48.479> and<00:04:49.639> you<00:04:50.639> can<00:04:50.729> come

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
let's hit options here and you can come

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.959 
let's hit options here and you can come
in<00:04:50.999> here<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:51.360> you<00:04:51.419> can<00:04:51.569> modify<00:04:52.279> the<00:04:53.279> display

00:04:53.959 --> 00:04:53.969 
in here and you can modify the display

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:56.869 
in here and you can modify the display
options<00:04:54.659> for<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:55.740> connection<00:04:56.219> you<00:04:56.460> can<00:04:56.669> make

00:04:56.869 --> 00:04:56.879 
options for the connection you can make

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:58.309 
options for the connection you can make
it<00:04:57.029> smaller<00:04:57.150> or<00:04:57.419> larger<00:04:57.539> as<00:04:57.960> far<00:04:58.139> as<00:04:58.229> the

00:04:58.309 --> 00:04:58.319 
it smaller or larger as far as the

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.679 
it smaller or larger as far as the
resolution<00:04:58.860> this<00:04:59.610> will<00:04:59.819> save<00:04:59.969> on<00:05:00.150> bandwidth

00:05:00.679 --> 00:05:00.689 
resolution this will save on bandwidth

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:01.879 
resolution this will save on bandwidth
so<00:05:00.930> if<00:05:01.050> you<00:05:01.139> have<00:05:01.259> a<00:05:01.289> slow<00:05:01.620> internet

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:01.889 
so if you have a slow internet

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.290 
so if you have a slow internet
connection<00:05:02.129> and<00:05:02.610> you're<00:05:02.729> connecting<00:05:03.180> over

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
connection and you're connecting over

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:07.129 
connection and you're connecting over
the<00:05:03.659> internet<00:05:04.520> then<00:05:05.689> adjusting<00:05:06.689> these<00:05:06.810> will

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
the internet then adjusting these will

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:08.899 
the internet then adjusting these will
actually<00:05:07.169> make<00:05:07.590> the<00:05:08.039> connection<00:05:08.669> go<00:05:08.759> a<00:05:08.789> little

00:05:08.899 --> 00:05:08.909 
actually make the connection go a little

00:05:08.909 --> 00:05:11.929 
actually make the connection go a little
bit<00:05:09.060> faster<00:05:09.539> so<00:05:09.779> you<00:05:10.409> may<00:05:11.400> want<00:05:11.610> to<00:05:11.639> use<00:05:11.699> them

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
bit faster so you may want to use them

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:13.820 
bit faster so you may want to use them
if<00:05:12.120> you're<00:05:12.330> connecting<00:05:12.810> on<00:05:12.930> the<00:05:13.080> land<00:05:13.379> then

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
if you're connecting on the land then

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:16.429 
if you're connecting on the land then
you're<00:05:14.009> fine<00:05:14.509> you<00:05:15.509> can<00:05:15.689> probably<00:05:15.900> turn<00:05:16.259> these

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:16.439 
you're fine you can probably turn these

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:17.540 
you're fine you can probably turn these
up<00:05:16.560> a<00:05:16.589> little<00:05:16.650> bit<00:05:16.860> higher<00:05:17.009> if<00:05:17.189> you<00:05:17.310> really

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
up a little bit higher if you really

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.209 
up a little bit higher if you really
need<00:05:17.699> to<00:05:18.139> local<00:05:19.139> resources<00:05:19.560> right<00:05:19.860> here<00:05:20.129> is

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
need to local resources right here is

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:22.040 
need to local resources right here is
what<00:05:20.430> I<00:05:20.460> really<00:05:20.969> want<00:05:21.150> to<00:05:21.300> stress<00:05:21.479> about<00:05:21.749> at

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
what I really want to stress about at

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.110 
what I really want to stress about at
the<00:05:22.259> bottom<00:05:22.830> you'll<00:05:23.310> see<00:05:23.400> there's<00:05:23.789> local

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
the bottom you'll see there's local

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.850 
the bottom you'll see there's local
devices<00:05:24.539> and<00:05:24.719> resources<00:05:25.169> we<00:05:25.259> can<00:05:25.319> hit<00:05:25.469> more

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
devices and resources we can hit more

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.959 
devices and resources we can hit more
and<00:05:26.330> we<00:05:27.330> can<00:05:27.479> actually<00:05:28.069> network<00:05:29.069> mount<00:05:29.430> the

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 
and we can actually network mount the

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.170 
and we can actually network mount the
drives<00:05:30.830> so<00:05:31.830> by<00:05:31.949> default<00:05:32.099> this<00:05:32.400> is<00:05:32.460> unchecked

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
drives so by default this is unchecked

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:36.050 
drives so by default this is unchecked
so<00:05:33.509> keep<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.169> checked<00:05:34.500> and<00:05:34.800> basically<00:05:35.699> what

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
so keep it checked and basically what

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.209 
so keep it checked and basically what
this<00:05:36.270> does<00:05:36.629> is<00:05:36.960> once<00:05:37.379> we<00:05:37.469> connect<00:05:37.889> let's

00:05:38.209 --> 00:05:38.219 
this does is once we connect let's

00:05:38.219 --> 00:05:41.300 
this does is once we connect let's
connect<00:05:38.909> specking<00:05:39.300> it'll<00:05:40.169> mount<00:05:40.469> the<00:05:40.740> local

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
connect specking it'll mount the local

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:44.570 
connect specking it'll mount the local
computers<00:05:41.879> drives<00:05:42.479> as<00:05:42.899> network<00:05:43.830> drives<00:05:44.250> that

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
computers drives as network drives that

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.170 
computers drives as network drives that
way<00:05:44.729> you<00:05:44.789> can<00:05:45.060> pass<00:05:45.449> files<00:05:45.990> between<00:05:46.379> them<00:05:47.180> so

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
way you can pass files between them so

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.079 
way you can pass files between them so
you'll<00:05:48.330> see<00:05:48.569> here's<00:05:48.990> a<00:05:49.319> C<00:05:49.979> and<00:05:50.159> D<00:05:50.639> and<00:05:50.909> these

00:05:51.079 --> 00:05:51.089 
you'll see here's a C and D and these

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.709 
you'll see here's a C and D and these
are<00:05:51.270> mounted<00:05:51.919> from<00:05:52.919> this<00:05:53.669> computer<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.569> we

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:54.719 
are mounted from this computer that we

00:05:54.719 --> 00:05:57.439 
are mounted from this computer that we
came<00:05:54.990> from<00:05:55.169> as<00:05:55.800> you<00:05:56.069> can<00:05:56.189> see<00:05:56.460> a<00:05:56.639> there's<00:05:57.300> no

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:57.449 
came from as you can see a there's no

00:05:57.449 --> 00:06:00.350 
came from as you can see a there's no
floppy<00:05:57.689> d<00:05:58.469> is<00:05:58.529> that<00:05:58.830> and<00:05:59.039> c<00:05:59.399> is<00:05:59.520> my<00:05:59.759> regular

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:00.360 
floppy d is that and c is my regular

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.790 
floppy d is that and c is my regular
drop<00:06:00.889> so<00:06:01.889> we<00:06:02.069> can<00:06:02.250> actually<00:06:02.460> pass

00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:06.800 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.409 

right<00:06:07.520> here<00:06:08.060> and<00:06:08.240> then<00:06:09.610> there<00:06:10.610> we<00:06:10.699> go<00:06:10.819> new<00:06:11.180> file

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419 
right here and then there we go new file

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:14.379 
right here and then there we go new file
so<00:06:11.629> you<00:06:11.659> can<00:06:11.750> actually<00:06:11.960> pass<00:06:12.379> files<00:06:13.389> through

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:14.389 
so you can actually pass files through

so you can actually pass files through
the<00:06:14.479> connection<00:06:14.930> there<00:06:15.139> and<00:06:15.409> that's<00:06:16.340> one<00:06:16.819> of

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:16.849
