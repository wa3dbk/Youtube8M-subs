00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:10.200
 i used sony alpha 7r for a long time 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 x1 p and in terms of characteristic this 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.009
 of course interesting gadgets 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.220
 but that's like a photographer's tool but not 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:20.189
 too slow accurate autofocus 

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:21.810
 Scanty and rather expensive park of optics 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.070
 despite the fact that the quality of the optics itself to me 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.470
 it seems at this price absolutely not 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.269
 falls well for landscape painters probably 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.250
 no problem screwed manual olympus 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:31.470
 om or put the watering can on the tripod and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.660
 masterpiece clicks but shoot children or 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.430
 kotyatok well under these tasks I would have these 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.530
 the camera would not recommend but 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.110
 Now I am in the hands of sony alpha a7 with 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.210
 and if you take 112 megapixel new 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.680
 monsters as a result of working on 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.809
 errors in my opinion sony all 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.730
 done right first autofocus 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.010
 works much better than a year ago in 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.809
 7 and you can use it though its speed 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.489
 about 30 40 percent lower than 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.270
 crooked camera sharpened under video 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.530
 this is joe 470 smoke 5 mark 2 except this 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.000
 he has such a feature that he 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.129
 prefers induced on objects with 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.870
 unfortunately not repeating patterns 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.240
 such objects usually act as background 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.820
 brick wall expanded metal mesh 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.650
 tile so when shooting with this background 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.659
 better to use manual focus in 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.659
 the second came out more or less interesting 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.850
 lenses i tried 1635 and at 40 and he 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:23.070
 I really liked or this one 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:25.799
 the lens is 55 f-18 my favorite fix on 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.369
 sony system nice sharp cool 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:31.229
 there is a fix cheaper 35f 2 and 8 but on the other 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.259
 sides he is darker 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.090
 can use lenses off bang 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.070
 their cameras 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.649
 they are not always cheaper but 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.109
 come across a very worthy example of 1670 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.280
 for shooting full hd and such a lens 

00:01:43.109 --> 00:01:48.299
 more than enough 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.090
 the picture is not bad but the camera is dill 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.250
 gives out only 5 megapixels for 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.310
 Facebook and other social networks of this 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.569
 Of course enough but with coding already 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.359
 especially not play 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.850
 what I don't like in all lenses 

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.429
 sony from of course the question of the price of some 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.979
 for example at exactly 35 she's just a horse 

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.720
 still sony optics dark enough for 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.400
 luminosity these Japanese are not chasing 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.890
 and thatâ€™s where the main thing cuts out 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.030
 advantage a7s sensor large 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.620
 few megapixels 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.870
 each pixel is larger 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.620
 collects more light can be shot on 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.989
 high iso 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:23.910
 No detailed photos on iso above 32 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.700
 thousand this is still fantastic 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.920
 all the beauty and glamor within 1000 but 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.750
 raising Isa is not so scary 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.329
 aperture hold and shorter shutter speed 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.549
 put when you need at the same time father 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.340
 does not allow to write 4k on the USB stick 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.989
 very strange fast flash drive there is a lively 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.900
 an example of a camera that is capable of it 

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:44.280
 there is this panasonic gh4 so there is 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.859
 the assumption that the Japanese 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.989
 from sony just want us to buy 

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:51.180
 additional recorder and wrote 4k with 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.950
 it helps the Japanese to survive from us 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.510
 last money on this extra 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.120
 An accessory that may not always be 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.470
 need part of the management did not understand 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.700
 is it possible to hang moving in 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.560
 formed by focusing immediately on 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.069
 joystick spider without any stupid 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.380
 menu 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.940
 it seems that there is no me personally 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:07.680
 like understandably what 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.150
 professional photographer from old 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.250
 schools try to be induced around the center and 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.319
 then move the cover but I somehow 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.220
 already used to choose it in syrup by hand and 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.349
 i have to become sleep and 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.730
 extra time otherwise 

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:19.950
 ergonomic camera on solid 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.500
 quad viewfinder is good but 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.419
 flagship fuji i olympus he more from 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.609
 cameras for 120 thousand rubles after all 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:28.169
 expect only the best from both 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.810
 thirty forty fifty lenses 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:33.410
 thousand rubles and not unfortunately not always 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:36.050
 lives up to expectations 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.480
 my angles and distortions are somehow not 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.640
 really like it so much is it worth a7s 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.340
 money this camera has a very wide 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.780
 iso operating range which allows 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.970
 use it in those situations when 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:49.670
 use there on chamber light or 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.310
 outbreak undesirable or unacceptable 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.050
 if this and only this already justifies 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.300
 for you any financial investments 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:58.880
 then the choice is obvious in all the others 

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.770
 I would have looked more at 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:04.210
 affordable cameras because 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:04.210
 cheaper does not mean worse 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:20.750
