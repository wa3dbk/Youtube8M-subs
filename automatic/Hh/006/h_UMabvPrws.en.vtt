00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.590 

so<00:00:00.780> Maxwell<00:00:01.230> was<00:00:01.650> all<00:00:01.920> like<00:00:02.190> hey<00:00:02.610> guys<00:00:02.879> I<00:00:03.210> think

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
so Maxwell was all like hey guys I think

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.990 
so Maxwell was all like hey guys I think
that<00:00:03.810> the<00:00:03.990> speed<00:00:04.290> of<00:00:04.319> light<00:00:04.470> is<00:00:04.920> really<00:00:05.400> fast<00:00:05.759> I

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
that the speed of light is really fast I

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.810 
that the speed of light is really fast I
think<00:00:06.089> it's<00:00:06.890> like<00:00:07.890> well<00:00:08.370> because<00:00:08.610> he<00:00:08.700> had

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
think it's like well because he had

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.580 
think it's like well because he had
these<00:00:08.940> constants<00:00:09.510> from<00:00:09.660> electricity<00:00:10.380> and

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
these constants from electricity and

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.160 
these constants from electricity and
magnetism<00:00:11.099> I<00:00:11.370> think<00:00:11.610> it's<00:00:11.790> three<00:00:12.450> times<00:00:12.840> ten

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
magnetism I think it's three times ten

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.020 
magnetism I think it's three times ten
to<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.349> eighth<00:00:13.530> meters<00:00:13.559> per<00:00:14.250> second<00:00:14.670> and<00:00:14.759> four

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
to the eighth meters per second and four

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.080 
to the eighth meters per second and four
so<00:00:15.210> this<00:00:15.859> amazing<00:00:16.859> French<00:00:17.190> physicist<00:00:17.730> who<00:00:17.910> did

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
so this amazing French physicist who did

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.670 
so this amazing French physicist who did
all<00:00:18.270> kinds<00:00:18.600> of<00:00:18.630> cool<00:00:18.779> things<00:00:18.810> including<00:00:19.500> some

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
all kinds of cool things including some

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.580 
all kinds of cool things including some
really<00:00:19.770> really<00:00:20.220> seminal<00:00:20.460> work<00:00:20.699> on<00:00:20.850> capacitors

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:21.590 
really really seminal work on capacitors

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.550 
really really seminal work on capacitors
in<00:00:22.609> 1850<00:00:23.609> was<00:00:24.029> sitting<00:00:24.359> around<00:00:24.570> by<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.199> fire

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
in 1850 was sitting around by the fire

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.990 
in 1850 was sitting around by the fire
reading<00:00:26.099> um<00:00:26.550> he<00:00:27.480> was<00:00:27.630> reading<00:00:27.869> Maxwell's<00:00:28.710> work

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000 
reading um he was reading Maxwell's work

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.310 
reading um he was reading Maxwell's work
and<00:00:30.000> he<00:00:30.150> says<00:00:30.390> well<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:30.990> figure<00:00:31.140> out

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
and he says well let's figure out

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.840 
and he says well let's figure out
exactly<00:00:31.470> how<00:00:31.800> fast<00:00:31.980> light<00:00:32.219> goes<00:00:32.399> now<00:00:32.610> think

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
exactly how fast light goes now think

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.190 
exactly how fast light goes now think
about<00:00:32.940> that<00:00:33.059> how<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.630> heck<00:00:33.899> you're<00:00:34.020> going<00:00:34.140> to

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
about that how the heck you're going to

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.900 
about that how the heck you're going to
find<00:00:34.350> out<00:00:34.410> how<00:00:34.530> fast<00:00:34.710> light<00:00:34.950> goes<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.309> somebody

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
find out how fast light goes if somebody

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.450 
find out how fast light goes if somebody
just<00:00:36.149> told<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.480> they<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.870> it<00:00:36.989> goes<00:00:37.460> 300

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
just told you they think it goes 300

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.630 
just told you they think it goes 300
million<00:00:39.120> meters<00:00:39.629> in<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.559> second<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.190> means

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
million meters in a second that means

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.880 
million meters in a second that means
it's<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:41.969> well<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.260> than<00:00:43.469> all<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.800> way

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
it's going well more than all the way

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.500 
it's going well more than all the way
around<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> world<00:00:44.460> within<00:00:44.789> one<00:00:45.120> second

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
around the world within one second

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.610 
around the world within one second
that's<00:00:45.570> not<00:00:45.750> going<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:45.989> be<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.140> pretty<00:00:46.410> tricky

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
that's not going to be a pretty tricky

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.080 
that's not going to be a pretty tricky
thing<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.340> measure

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
thing to measure

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.049 
thing to measure
so<00:00:48.329> it's<00:00:48.690> 1850<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.800> here's<00:00:50.190> what<00:00:50.370> he<00:00:50.460> does<00:00:50.640> he

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
so it's 1850 and here's what he does he

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.260 
so it's 1850 and here's what he does he
takes<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.539> mirror<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.620> it's<00:00:53.129> only<00:00:53.370> like<00:00:53.760> semi

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
takes a mirror and it's only like semi

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.910 
takes a mirror and it's only like semi
glazed<00:00:54.719> mirror<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> pretty<00:00:55.710> typical

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
glazed mirror this is a pretty typical

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.069 
glazed mirror this is a pretty typical
thing<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.489> used<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:57.000> physics<00:00:57.449> it's<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
thing that we used in physics it's a

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.590 
thing that we used in physics it's a
semi<00:00:58.440> reflective<00:00:59.219> mirror<00:00:59.699> and<00:00:59.850> that<00:01:00.329> means

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
semi reflective mirror and that means

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.330 
semi reflective mirror and that means
that<00:01:00.899> some<00:01:01.170> light<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.649> get<00:01:01.800> through<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
that some light can get through it and

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.100 
that some light can get through it and
some<00:01:02.579> light<00:01:02.760> will<00:01:02.910> be<00:01:03.030> bent<00:01:03.270> off<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> so

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
some light will be bent off of it so

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.600 
some light will be bent off of it so
that<00:01:04.290> mirror<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.589> sitting<00:01:05.010> right<00:01:05.189> there<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
that mirror is sitting right there and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.789 
that mirror is sitting right there and
he's<00:01:05.939> gonna<00:01:06.060> take<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.689> what<00:01:07.020> here<00:01:07.470> look<00:01:07.710> at

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
he's gonna take that what here look at

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.109 
he's gonna take that what here look at
this<00:01:07.890> there's<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.520> center<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.790> reflective

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
this there's a center of reflective

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.350 
this there's a center of reflective
mirror<00:01:09.330> okay<00:01:10.189> he<00:01:11.189> takes<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.760> he<00:01:11.880> ripped<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.240> off

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
mirror okay he takes it he ripped it off

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.080 
mirror okay he takes it he ripped it off
of<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.630> car<00:01:12.869> just<00:01:13.110> kidding<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.710> uh<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.549> then

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
of a car just kidding and uh and then

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.539 
of a car just kidding and uh and then
there's<00:01:15.270> light<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.650> he<00:01:16.920> has<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.310> laser

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
there's light here so he has this laser

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.700 
there's light here so he has this laser
pointer<00:01:17.869> or<00:01:18.869> maybe<00:01:19.080> it<00:01:19.200> wasn't<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> laser

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
pointer or maybe it wasn't the laser

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.130 
pointer or maybe it wasn't the laser
pointer<00:01:20.070> because<00:01:20.310> it<00:01:20.430> was<00:01:20.520> 1850<00:01:21.210> it<00:01:21.450> probably

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
pointer because it was 1850 it probably

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.620 
pointer because it was 1850 it probably
wasn't<00:01:22.350> even<00:01:22.619> a<00:01:22.830> light<00:01:23.040> bulb<00:01:23.189> it<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> candle

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
wasn't even a light bulb it was a candle

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.039 
wasn't even a light bulb it was a candle
or<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.200> lantern<00:01:25.740> in<00:01:25.950> 1850<00:01:26.909> and<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.509> laser<00:01:27.750> light

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
or a lantern in 1850 and the laser light

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.819 
or a lantern in 1850 and the laser light
anyway<00:01:28.500> comes<00:01:28.829> out<00:01:29.009> here<00:01:29.280> and<00:01:29.310> it<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:30.829> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
anyway comes out here and it goes and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.350 
anyway comes out here and it goes and
some<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.340> it<00:01:32.460> reflects<00:01:32.759> off<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.939> here<00:01:33.150> but<00:01:33.270> we

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
some of it reflects off of here but we

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.179 
some of it reflects off of here but we
don't<00:01:33.450> care<00:01:33.720> about<00:01:33.780> that<00:01:34.140> but<00:01:34.530> what<00:01:34.770> what<00:01:34.950> I'm

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
don't care about that but what what I'm

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.399 
don't care about that but what what I'm
concerned<00:01:35.549> about<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.970> that<00:01:36.299> some<00:01:36.689> of<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.960> goes

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
concerned about is that some of it goes

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.660 
concerned about is that some of it goes
through<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:39.439> passes<00:01:40.439> through<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.799> devious

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
through and passes through this devious

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.420 
through and passes through this devious
device<00:01:42.390> and<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.049> device<00:01:43.170> was<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.250> was

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
device and the device was like it was

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.490 
device and the device was like it was
like<00:01:44.670> well<00:01:45.420> let<00:01:45.659> me<00:01:45.689> kind<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> draw<00:01:46.200> it<00:01:46.229> for<00:01:46.470> you

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
like well let me kind of draw it for you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.580 
like well let me kind of draw it for you
it's<00:01:46.710> like<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.009> circle<00:01:47.930> but<00:01:48.930> it<00:01:49.049> wasn't<00:01:49.470> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
it's like the circle but it wasn't a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.710 
it's like the circle but it wasn't a
complete<00:01:49.860> circle<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.549> had<00:01:50.670> these<00:01:50.820> notches<00:01:51.540> in

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
complete circle it had these notches in

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.690 
complete circle it had these notches in
it<00:01:51.810> which<00:01:52.290> had<00:01:52.530> little<00:01:52.770> holes<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.369> them<00:01:53.520> and

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it which had little holes in them and

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
it which had little holes in them and
let's<00:01:54.090> say<00:01:54.299> that<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.600> had<00:01:54.780> 20<00:01:55.079> holes<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.890> I

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
let's say that it had 20 holes in it I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.819 
let's say that it had 20 holes in it I
don't<00:01:56.310> know<00:01:56.399> something<00:01:56.850> like<00:01:57.000> that<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.829> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
don't know something like that and it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.550 
don't know something like that and it
looked<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.250> this<00:01:59.549> so<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.570> guy<00:02:00.780> if<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.229> spin

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
looked like this so this guy if you spin

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.649 
looked like this so this guy if you spin
it<00:02:01.850> enables<00:02:02.850> light<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> get<00:02:03.360> through

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
it enables light to get through

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.420 
it enables light to get through
sometimes<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.469> if<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.619> spin<00:02:04.860> it<00:02:04.950> fast<00:02:05.219> enough

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
sometimes and if I spin it fast enough

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.089 
sometimes and if I spin it fast enough
you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.240> kind<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.750> see<00:02:07.290> through<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.680> let's<00:02:07.920> see

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
you can kind of see through it let's see

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.499 
you can kind of see through it let's see
that<00:02:08.310> can<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:08.759> kind<00:02:08.940> of<00:02:09.000> see<00:02:09.149> through<00:02:09.300> that

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
that can you kind of see through that

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.880 
that can you kind of see through that
probably<00:02:09.989> not<00:02:10.200> because<00:02:10.319> it's<00:02:10.500> kind<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.679> dark

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
probably not because it's kind of dark

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.550 
probably not because it's kind of dark
but<00:02:11.099> I<00:02:11.220> can<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.660> can<00:02:13.110> see

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
but I can and I can see

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.680 
but I can and I can see
through<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.950> sometimes<00:02:14.790> now<00:02:15.209> the<00:02:15.270> beautiful

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
through it sometimes now the beautiful

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.920 
through it sometimes now the beautiful
thing<00:02:16.140> is<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:17.580> laser<00:02:17.880> beam<00:02:18.180> would<00:02:18.360> only<00:02:18.569> get

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
thing is the laser beam would only get

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.089 
thing is the laser beam would only get
through<00:02:19.260> this<00:02:19.530> sucker

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
through this sucker

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.370 
through this sucker
sometimes<00:02:20.880> so<00:02:21.450> let's<00:02:21.660> say<00:02:21.810> the<00:02:21.930> laser<00:02:22.080> being

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
sometimes so let's say the laser being

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.800 
sometimes so let's say the laser being
made<00:02:22.590> it<00:02:22.739> through<00:02:23.010> but<00:02:23.819> the<00:02:23.940> problem<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.510> the

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
made it through but the problem is the

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.850 
made it through but the problem is the
laser<00:02:24.989> beam<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.260> going<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.500> hit<00:02:25.650> another

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
laser beam is going to hit another

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.479 
laser beam is going to hit another
mirror<00:02:26.400> this<00:02:26.670> is<00:02:26.730> a<00:02:26.880> high<00:02:27.120> quality<00:02:27.180> mirror<00:02:30.140> and

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:31.489 
mirror this is a high quality mirror and

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:34.580 
mirror this is a high quality mirror and
the<00:02:32.489> only<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.180> laser<00:02:33.599> beam<00:02:33.870> can<00:02:34.110> make<00:02:34.380> it

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the only way that laser beam can make it

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.720 
the only way that laser beam can make it
back<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:37.200> only<00:02:37.380> way<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.890> laser<00:02:38.099> beam<00:02:38.430> can

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
back the only way the laser beam can

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.350 
back the only way the laser beam can
come<00:02:39.120> back<00:02:39.480> is<00:02:39.840> if<00:02:40.440> it<00:02:40.769> happens<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:42.030> pass

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
come back is if it happens to pass

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.140 
come back is if it happens to pass
through<00:02:42.920> another<00:02:43.920> one<00:02:44.310> the<00:02:44.519> slits<00:02:44.819> because<00:02:45.030> by

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
through another one the slits because by

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.270 
through another one the slits because by
the<00:02:45.209> time<00:02:45.480> that<00:02:45.630> first<00:02:45.930> slit<00:02:46.200> but<00:02:46.590> let's<00:02:46.860> bit<00:02:47.100> a

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
the time that first slit but let's bit a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.490 
the time that first slit but let's bit a
big<00:02:47.970> distance<00:02:48.420> here<00:02:48.660> let's<00:02:48.870> make<00:02:49.019> this<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.230> long

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
big distance here let's make this a long

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.479 
big distance here let's make this a long
way<00:02:49.980> away

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
way away

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.610 
way away
all<00:02:50.670> right<00:02:51.450> cool<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.900> only<00:02:52.230> way<00:02:52.350> the<00:02:52.500> laser

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
all right cool the only way the laser

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.170 
all right cool the only way the laser
beam<00:02:52.920> can<00:02:53.100> make<00:02:53.310> it<00:02:53.430> back<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.730> if<00:02:53.850> it<00:02:53.970> comes

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
beam can make it back is if it comes

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.970 
beam can make it back is if it comes
through<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.660> next<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.230> maybe<00:02:55.260> the<00:02:55.620> second

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
through the next or maybe the second

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.150 
through the next or maybe the second
next<00:02:56.130> or<00:02:56.340> third<00:02:56.580> next<00:02:57.000> of<00:02:57.750> those<00:02:58.290> slots<00:02:58.530> and<00:02:58.830> if

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
next or third next of those slots and if

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.110 
next or third next of those slots and if
this<00:02:59.370> distance<00:02:59.610> is<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.299> don't<00:03:00.630> know<00:03:01.190> rooms<00:03:02.190> or<00:03:02.640> a

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
this distance is I don't know rooms or a

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.750 
this distance is I don't know rooms or a
kilometer<00:03:03.959> or<00:03:03.989> something<00:03:04.709> then<00:03:05.099> you'll<00:03:05.549> be

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
kilometer or something then you'll be

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.660 
kilometer or something then you'll be
able<00:03:05.940> to<00:03:06.239> see<00:03:06.420> oh<00:03:07.040> where's<00:03:08.040> the<00:03:08.220> eye<00:03:08.250> of

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
physics going to be in this problem

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.530 
physics going to be in this problem
let's<00:03:10.470> make<00:03:10.650> it<00:03:10.680> a<00:03:10.890> blue<00:03:11.400> eye<00:03:11.430> of<00:03:11.910> physics<00:03:12.390> up

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
let's make it a blue eye of physics up

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.960 
let's make it a blue eye of physics up
here<00:03:12.930> and<00:03:13.080> we'll<00:03:13.470> say<00:03:13.709> that<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.610> is<00:03:14.819> our

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
here and we'll say that this is our

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.660 
here and we'll say that this is our
observer<00:03:15.690> who<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.319> watching<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.040> experiment

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
observer who is watching the experiment

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.349 
observer who is watching the experiment
with<00:03:17.910> some<00:03:18.209> nice<00:03:18.359> eyelashes<00:03:19.260> and<00:03:19.820> you<00:03:20.820> want<00:03:21.150> to

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
with some nice eyelashes and you want to

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.870 
with some nice eyelashes and you want to
know<00:03:21.540> if<00:03:21.810> you're<00:03:22.200> going<00:03:22.410> to<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.100> light<00:03:23.340> so

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
know if you're going to see the light so

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.630 
know if you're going to see the light so
you're<00:03:24.420> beginning<00:03:24.930> to<00:03:25.170> see<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.890> light<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.400> was

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
you're beginning to see the light it was

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.530 
you're beginning to see the light it was
going<00:03:27.000> this<00:03:27.180> way<00:03:27.359> and<00:03:27.390> it<00:03:27.660> comes<00:03:27.959> back<00:03:28.109> only<00:03:28.799> at

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:29.540 
going this way and it comes back only at

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.340 
going this way and it comes back only at
exactly<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:31.260> right<00:03:31.650> frequency<00:03:32.459> of<00:03:33.390> spinning

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:34.350 
exactly the right frequency of spinning

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.830 
exactly the right frequency of spinning
this<00:03:34.890> disc<00:03:35.370> see<00:03:35.970> if<00:03:36.090> you're<00:03:36.239> spinning<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.660> too

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
this disc see if you're spinning it too

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:37.460 
this disc see if you're spinning it too
slowly

and<00:04:09.840> he<00:04:10.049> managed<00:04:10.319> to<00:04:10.350> get<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.560> speed<00:04:10.739> of<00:04:10.829> light

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
and he managed to get the speed of light
