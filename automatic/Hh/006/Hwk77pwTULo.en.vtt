00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.450
 do it 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.620
 hello i am rijn and i would like to let you in 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.809
 this review 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.389
 see something more beautiful 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:19.199
 double door fridge freezer it is 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.199
 the gs 5162 avm set from lg 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.710
 if we get the GS 5162 from the package 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.850
 have got 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:29.050
 well then this impressive one 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:31.560
 fridge-freezer combination and there is whole 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.560
 much to tell about it 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.370
 Well let's see what 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.789
 specifications of this beautiful 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.190
 refrigirator with freezer 

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:41.769
 total no frost and that means you 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.960
 have nowhere really icing except 

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:46.120
 of course in the ice cube reservoir 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.719
 and he is no less than 40 percent 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.440
 more economical than a similar combination 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.819
 the energy label is therefore 40 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.350
 percent more economical than the normal a 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.149
 energy label and this is not 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.749
 unimportant because he has 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:03.999
 linear compression and that makes it 

00:01:00.749 --> 00:01:05.740
 fridge-freezer combination very quiet 

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:06.760
 we find particularly beautifully aligned 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.460
 here in the middle of the doors 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.860
 actually two units on and when I'm on 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.930
 pressing this button opens one here 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.729
 door and behind this we find 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.520
 for example cold white wine or one 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.079
 cold soda or cold cans 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.270
 very handy because you use this then 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:24.670
 then just as a kind of bar 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.460
 table and on this side we find one 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:30.009
 dispencer in dispenser for both water 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.990
 like ice cubes so at the moment that I 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.810
 I can click here on the dispenser here 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.880
 choose water you can make large ice cubes 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.439
 and I can choose small ice cubes here 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.670
 choose 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.770
 and the moment i am against this now 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.890
 to pressure yes then so come the ice cubes 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.890
 from 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.080
 we will switch on the fridge for a while 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.860
 inside view start at the top 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.970
 well nicely closed box here lights 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.160
 shelves that are at different heights 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:01.680
 Adjustable are nice when they are heavy for it 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.050
 a bottle in it and then hit the 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.840
 below we see three sun's 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.540
 closed bins and those bins 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.970
 which you can check the seat is you 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.740
 middle tea check on it mean you 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.500
 humidity in those bins 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:18.840
 can regulate well then I take a look 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.730
 to the door of the fridge have it 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.420
 You this stretched are not in height 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.400
 adjustable 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.170
 but is also logical because here in it 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.230
 is in the middle of the unit as well 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.570
 equal the front this valve that we 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.920
 just have been served and this side 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.300
 we can talk about it is also very handy 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.220
 so easy if you have another bottle 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.840
 it wants to put some cans and 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.459
 furthermore you will find it here 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.130
 water reservoir is very important 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.950
 because thanks to this water reservoir 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.989
 this refrigerator does not have to be on the water 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.610
 just to be connected we can 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.650
 put speak in the middle of the room because 

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.360
 you fill this with water and this water 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.120
 also provides the ice cubes immediately 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.340
 Dispencer of water for the ice cubes 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.950
 and what you hear now is pretty nice too 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.810
 what the signal now goes that the door too 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.640
 long been open well here you still have 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.760
 space for large suits and 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.170
 big bottles name will close but then 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.900
 well let's this friesian is true 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.940
 just look inside 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.739
 well we see it is those ice cubes that 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.620
 spencer in a very good way 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.060
 is hidden in the door here sit the 

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.739
 ice cubes are fed to you 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.060
 because of the water there is for the other 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:23.250
 door we still have just here 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.970
 racks over in the door where we thingy 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.100
 to bet 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.769
 and furthermore we see that we quite a whole 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.320
 spacious freezer with different 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.080
 boards well and of course two more 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:35.880
 different drawers that also 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.410
 So once again closed 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.660
 very hygienic 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.209
 yes and for the lies natural and 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.519
 we don't need ice cubes 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.200
 because the ice cubes that make it yourself and 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.790
 they are there in the ice cube maker and 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.050
 the water is there for those ice cubes 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.730
 to be able to make 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:55.730
 take quite a bit of storage space 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.230
 batter 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.190
 without turning it on the water supply 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.080
 have to close 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.720
 do you have small ice cubes large 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.430
 ice cubes of cold water 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.900
 all at your disposal and moreover 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.700
 in the other door 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:11.370
 A little bar looks like your chilled 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:13.320
 drinks you get from the outside 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.760
 put it down on the table yes it 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:18.270
 all you have to do then 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.140
 is to put a glass and then there 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.140
 ice cubes 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:26.280
 are you looking for a beautiful looking 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.530

 small ice cubes and large ice cubes 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:33.720
 and those on the outside too 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.610
 a time when thou cool the bar you can 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:41.940
 Then use the GS 5162 AVM set of 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.210
