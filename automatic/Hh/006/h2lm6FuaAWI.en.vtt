00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
something to vapor finish it needs to be

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.660 
something to vapor finish it needs to be
printed<00:01:11.909> from<00:01:12.119> ABS<00:01:12.540> plastic<00:01:12.960> though<00:01:13.369> so<00:01:14.369> once

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
printed from ABS plastic though so once

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.249 
printed from ABS plastic though so once
you<00:01:14.820> have<00:01:14.909> all<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.180> goodies<00:01:15.420> together<00:01:15.720> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
first thing is to place the aluminium

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.030 
first thing is to place the aluminium
foil<00:01:18.180> on<00:01:18.479> the<00:01:18.600> bottom<00:01:18.810> of<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:18.990> container<00:01:19.229> this

every arrow so and then take it out when
it's<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:05.700> 80%<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.479> finished<00:02:06.780> as<00:02:06.899> you'd<00:02:07.049> like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
it's about 80% as finished as you'd like

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.229 
it's about 80% as finished as you'd like
it<00:02:07.409> it'll<00:02:08.129> take<00:02:08.250> another<00:02:08.459> couple<00:02:08.819> of<00:02:08.910> hours<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.089 
it it'll take another couple of hours to
fully<00:02:09.360> outguess<00:02:09.869> and<00:02:10.229> it'll<00:02:10.530> keep<00:02:10.709> getting

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
fully outguess and it'll keep getting

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.520 
fully outguess and it'll keep getting
smoother<00:02:11.520> during<00:02:11.819> this<00:02:11.910> time<00:02:12.209> also<00:02:13.020> remember

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.470 
the chamber incredibly smooth like cast
plastic<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.400> can't<00:02:26.610> even<00:02:26.790> see<00:02:27.090> any<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.420> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
plastic you can't even see any of the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.330 
plastic you can't even see any of the
lines<00:02:27.690> on<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.230> vertical<00:02:28.470> surfaces<00:02:29.040> it

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
lines on the vertical surfaces it

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.500 
lines on the vertical surfaces it
doesn't<00:02:29.640> even<00:02:29.700> look<00:02:29.820> like<00:02:29.940> it<00:02:30.120> was<00:02:30.210> 3d<00:02:30.480> printed

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
doesn't even look like it was 3d printed

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.410 
doesn't even look like it was 3d printed
anymore<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:32.040> only<00:02:32.340> weakness<00:02:32.700> to<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:32.970> system

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
anymore the only weakness to the system

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.390 
anymore the only weakness to the system
is<00:02:33.660> a<00:02:33.690> horizontal<00:02:34.350> areas<00:02:34.890> like<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.220> top<00:02:35.370> of

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
is a horizontal areas like the top of

her head at the top of the tiger's head

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:40.400 
her head at the top of the tiger's head
don't<00:02:38.460> get<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> same<00:02:38.970> smooth<00:02:39.420> treatment<00:02:40.110> and

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
don't get the same smooth treatment and

don't get the same smooth treatment and
you'll<00:02:40.710> still<00:02:40.920> see<00:02:41.130> some<00:02:41.430> steps<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.900> overall

you'll still see some steps but overall
it's<00:02:43.410> an<00:02:43.470> incredible<00:02:43.890> technique<00:02:44.370> really<00:02:44.580> easy

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
it's an incredible technique really easy

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:48.650 
it's an incredible technique really easy
to<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.510> it's<00:02:46.350> fairly<00:02:46.890> painless<00:02:47.450> if<00:02:48.450> you
