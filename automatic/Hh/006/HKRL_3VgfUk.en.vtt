they're not the only company that has is

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
they're not the only company that has is
doing<00:01:39.509> three<00:01:39.780> free<00:01:40.079> but<00:01:40.860> they've<00:01:41.100> been<00:01:41.340> doing

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
doing three free but they've been doing

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
doing three free but they've been doing
it<00:01:41.670> since<00:01:41.820> they've<00:01:42.270> started<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:43.229> I<00:01:43.259> guess<00:01:43.530> that

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
it since they've started so I guess that

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.710 
it since they've started so I guess that
gives<00:01:43.770> them<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.220> slight<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:45.060> advantage<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
gives them a slight more advantage and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.670 
gives them a slight more advantage and
longevity<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> their<00:01:48.720> smell<00:01:49.020> isn't

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
longevity to it and their smell isn't
