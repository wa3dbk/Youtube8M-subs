 [Music] 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.900
 as you can see I have it complete that 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.070
 he wants to buy it do not look for one of his 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.070
 cracks that there are for the store 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.700
 they want to play a little bit so they can see how 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.700
 It's the game 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.380
 good game is about this guy who 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.670
 come here running the goal of 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.619
 game is to change the gravity so that 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.570
 can keep running which is done 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.900
 pressing the space key or the button 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.900
 of the mouse 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:05.159
 as you can see it is not so easy is now 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:07.799
 playing in endless mode is also mode 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.390
 as a rescue and career you have to 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:12.140
 end in career mode to start 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.140
 the rescue mode 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.760
 as you can see it is easy but there are times 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 that it is difficult to change the severity 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.330
 how many times was like that once is it 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.330
 complicated 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.569
 and you have to prevent this guy coming 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.569
 here back the reach 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.800
 [Music] 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.800
 I'll tell you but it's a bit difficult 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.500
 They saw that he died but he is persistent 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.870
 for this you have to have very good 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:11.870
 coordination 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.790
 yh 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.640
