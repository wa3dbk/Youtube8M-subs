00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the bird will have no color so what I'm

doing<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.079> just<00:00:58.109> coloring<00:00:58.640> around<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
doing is I'm just coloring around the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.250 
doing is I'm just coloring around the
edges<00:01:01.940> if<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> notice<00:01:03.359> I'm<00:01:03.510> using<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.870> little

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
edges if you notice I'm using a little

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.030 
edges if you notice I'm using a little
finer<00:01:05.659> pressure<00:01:06.659> on<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.049> pencil<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> get

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
finer pressure on the pencil as I get

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.660 
finer pressure on the pencil as I get
closer<00:01:08.310> towards<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.820> beat<00:01:10.040> if<00:01:11.040> you<00:01:11.280> do<00:01:11.430> that

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
closer towards the beat if you do that

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.640 
closer towards the beat if you do that
ahead<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.360> time<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.900> makes<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> easier<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
ahead of time that makes it easier when

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.399 
ahead of time that makes it easier when
you<00:01:13.799> go<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:13.950> blend<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.430> color<00:01:14.640> together<00:01:15.409> and

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
you go to blend the color together and

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:30.260 
you go to blend the color together and
I'm<00:01:16.500> gonna<00:01:16.710> fill<00:01:16.979> in<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.400> bit

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.590 

now<00:01:30.869> I'm<00:01:31.049> gonna<00:01:31.340> wet<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.369> tip<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.939> my<00:01:32.970> stump

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
now I'm gonna wet the tip of my stump

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.130 
now I'm gonna wet the tip of my stump
with<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.369> odorless<00:01:35.369> mineral<00:01:35.399> spirits<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.450> I

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
with the odorless mineral spirits and I

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.289 
with the odorless mineral spirits and I
kind<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.439> tip<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> bottle<00:01:38.460> upside<00:01:38.939> down

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
kind of tip the bottle upside down

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.510 
kind of tip the bottle upside down
you<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.509> see<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.380> paper<00:01:40.649> soaking<00:01:41.250> up<00:01:41.340> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
you can see the the paper soaking up the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.999 
you can see the the paper soaking up the
spirits<00:01:42.390> right<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:42.840> but<00:01:43.590> I<00:01:43.619> took<00:01:43.710> the

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
spirits right there but I took the

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.249 
spirits right there but I took the
bottle<00:01:44.159> upside<00:01:44.399> down<00:01:44.729> so<00:01:45.000> I<00:01:45.030> get<00:01:45.270> some<00:01:46.049> of<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
bottle upside down so I get some of the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.580 
bottle upside down so I get some of the
mineral<00:01:46.680> spirits<00:01:46.890> onto<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.610> applicator<00:01:48.590> and

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
mineral spirits onto the applicator and

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.749 
mineral spirits onto the applicator and
I'm<00:01:49.710> going<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:49.979> use<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:51.110> slow<00:01:52.110> circle<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
I'm going to use a slow circle and I

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.609 
I'm going to use a slow circle and I
like<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.090> go<00:01:54.210> from<00:01:54.330> the<00:01:54.420> lighter<00:01:54.720> color<00:01:55.110> down

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
like to go from the lighter color down

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.219 
like to go from the lighter color down
to<00:01:55.830> the<00:01:55.920> darker<00:01:56.310> color<00:01:56.549> if<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.720> pick<00:01:57.929> up<00:01:58.049> too

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
to the darker color if I pick up too

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.380 
to the darker color if I pick up too
much<00:01:58.380> color<00:01:58.710> while<00:01:59.549> I'm<00:01:59.670> trying<00:01:59.939> to<00:02:00.030> blend<00:02:00.210> a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
much color while I'm trying to blend a

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.260 
much color while I'm trying to blend a
white<00:02:00.570> then<00:02:00.899> it<00:02:01.020> won't<00:02:01.170> blend<00:02:01.770> as<00:02:01.950> easily<00:02:02.270> so

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
white then it won't blend as easily so

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.009 
white then it won't blend as easily so
I'm<00:02:03.360> starting<00:02:03.690> with<00:02:03.810> the<00:02:03.959> softer<00:02:05.420> side<00:02:06.420> first

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:15.530 

get<00:02:10.019> a<00:02:10.049> little<00:02:10.289> bit<00:02:10.440> more<00:02:14.150> then<00:02:15.150> I'll<00:02:15.299> start

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
get a little bit more then I'll start

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.850 
get a little bit more then I'll start
moving<00:02:15.840> down<00:02:15.959> into<00:02:16.290> the<00:02:16.380> more<00:02:16.500> concentrated

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
moving down into the more concentrated

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.370 
moving down into the more concentrated
color<00:02:19.190> circular<00:02:20.190> motions<00:02:20.610> works<00:02:20.850> the<00:02:21.060> best

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
color circular motions works the best

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:28.610 
color circular motions works the best
but<00:02:22.380> I<00:02:22.410> don't<00:02:22.650> always<00:02:22.769> stick<00:02:23.160> to<00:02:23.340> that<00:02:27.620> I'm

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
but I don't always stick to that I'm

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.199 
but I don't always stick to that I'm
also<00:02:28.799> going<00:02:29.099> to<00:02:29.160> be<00:02:29.310> cutting<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.730> bird<00:02:30.030> out

00:02:30.199 --> 00:02:30.209 
also going to be cutting this bird out

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.030 
also going to be cutting this bird out
so<00:02:30.540> I<00:02:30.569> don't<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:30.870> need<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.140> watch<00:02:31.380> my<00:02:31.620> edges

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
so I don't really need to watch my edges

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.070 
so I don't really need to watch my edges
although<00:02:32.430> it's<00:02:32.580> just<00:02:32.760> habit<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.510> stay<00:02:33.870> within

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
although it's just habit to stay within

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.509 
although it's just habit to stay within
the<00:02:34.290> lines<00:02:35.269> and<00:02:36.829> turning<00:02:37.829> the<00:02:37.950> paper<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.370> get<00:02:38.489> a

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
the lines and turning the paper to get a

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.130 
the lines and turning the paper to get a
different<00:02:38.880> angle<00:02:39.030> always<00:02:39.329> helps<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:39.900> that<00:02:39.930> you

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
different angle always helps so that you

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:58.910 
different angle always helps so that you
don't<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.470> one<00:02:41.120> set<00:02:42.120> direction

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920
