00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.740
 hello again with you leo grams i 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.839
 now I am in New York walking along 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.969
 this wonderful city and in this 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.660
 video I want to share experiences and procession 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:14.279
 across the united states and 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.789
 Having listened to this video you may be on the way 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:20.480
 you can save your money and very 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.480
 have a great time 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.060
 Well first things first as regards 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
 first moments when you start 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.669
 it is best to plan 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.050
 plan everything in advance sit down better 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.840
 not even a month or maybe even 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.590
 two months go get down below 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.690
 embassy 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.780
 Of course it's great to get a visa from the first 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.050
 times then you save lots of money and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:48.410
 bo1 fee and a visa costs 170 dollars this is 5 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410
 to rally 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.730
 Further, as for pellets, there is 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.950
 Such a moment if fly from Moscow 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.870
 new york and take a ticket for at least three 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.970
 weeks earlier or maybe even if 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:05.080
 lucky two weeks before departure 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.790
 then you can can find tickets 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.680
 Russian airlines in particular about 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:14.050
 price 11 13 thousand rubles 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.479
 Moscow New York New York Moscow that is 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.780
 round-trip ticket will cost 112 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:21.770
 thousand rubles which is very cheap it 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:25.700
 350-400 dollars is a very low price 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:29.030
 it is very profitable to gather in advance what 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:34.540
 concerns the local airlines american 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:37.340
 here the principle is very simple take 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.040
 this is a ticket for domestic flights on 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:42.770
 America in advance, we at least again 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.900
 two three weeks it won't cost much 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.530
 cheap 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:50.190
 and even cheaper than in Russia, this is due to 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:52.720
 so that in America very well since you 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:55.120
 domestic airlines their very big 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.700
 airports many flights of the most different 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.380
 America here in Russia airlines 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.080
 domestic so developed in russia more 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.010
 railway development moment the situation 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:08.860
 another here for example if you take in advance 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.560
 tickets from new york to los angeles top 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.680
 years can cost 120,130 dollars if 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.870
 you will take over 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:20.010
 there a week before departure that sleep can already 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.010
 be a half to two times higher 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:28.060
 as for hotels with hotels the situation 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.209
 America is very good because you 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:36.510
 a lot and their prices are very cheap with 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.510
 this quality is very high 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:46.959
 for example a hotel can average such 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:49.450
 price of the hotel where three stars per night 60 70 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:52.689
 dollars yes even 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.819
 50 dollars above 70 on standard looking 

00:02:52.689 --> 00:02:56.980
 what state if new york is of course here 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.190
 will be more expensive with a sheet of 70 80 dollars 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:02.470
 depending on where the same if you take the other 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.510
 cities in particular texas prices there 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:06.579
 low there will look for 50 60 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 dollars per night if you travel 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:09.879
 together to it turns out very love 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.150
 travel because you lose 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.980
 not 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.299
 hotel day ears too 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.099
 book in advance at least there for by 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.130
 three days because if 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:26.480
 book hotels literally one day 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:29.060
 cities like new york then you just don't 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:31.760
 maybe just koreans all numbers 

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.740
 will be busy and either give forget 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.960
 too expensive to transfer and spend the night and 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:40.880
 either have to be somehow different 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:43.850
 acts it will be difficult as for 

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 is it here at all food 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.980
 she's not cheap here that is mean 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.580
 just eat a restaurant you can 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:55.880
 cost there is 7-10 dollars, you can even 15 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.490
 if you are any more like this 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:02.350
 salt the restaurant and there may cost 15 

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.770
 20 25 dollars one meal 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.770
 1 snack 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:11.050
 here is the spring that is really more expensive here 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.280
 What is food in Russia ? 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.340
 one of those moments which tracks 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.160
 Russia immediately shows this 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:23.870
 again flights cheap flights and 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.810
 collect and in advance and if you take the hotel 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:30.800
 they are also cheaper than games about Moscow 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:34.580
 compare with Moscow is not much cheaper here 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:36.140
 as for clothes at all if you 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.140
 just swipe traveling by 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:42.590
 America then take a lot of things with you 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:44.180
 is worth here things are cheap with it 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.040
 had to high before baptism 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:50.690
 so you can easily here 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:52.820
 go shopping that's worth it 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.440
 again inexpensive good branded stuff 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.870
 you can buy for twenty thirty 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:59.810
 forty dollars jeans stand there twenty 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.849
 five to thirty dollars good t-shirts 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.839
 too inexpensive 2030 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.069
 the scene is so very low on hiv if 

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:09.080
 going to travel with me 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:12.199
 actively do someone go ride 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.149
 look at just such an active holiday 

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:18.020
 see as many different places as possible 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:22.009
 in new york there boston maybe 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:24.199
 In other cities, the most convenient option 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.059
 if you take your backpack what 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.779
 roomy to wear comfortably 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:29.469
 on shoulders 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:34.219
 because everywhere ride with a suitcase is 

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:35.809
 hard uncomfortable uncomfortable here and also 

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:39.110
 you can take your backpack here 

00:05:35.809 --> 00:05:40.939
 carry-on baggage and the plane is comfortable and not 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:45.740
 to waste time finding out the baggage 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:47.240
 then getting it all very convenient well 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:50.070
 perhaps these are the main points 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:52.940
 which I saw for myself 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:52.940
 did well here 

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:59.110
 that is, the principle is to calculate it for 2 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.270
 weeks if two for each heather 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:02.470
 $ 1,000 is enough for and tickets for 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.740
 accommodation and meals 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.810
 unless of course such a big diverge 

00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.740
 leg and I really spend so much with 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.050
 mean that's why travel by 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:17.860
 America today it is so affordable 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:20.890
 the price is very interesting you can get 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:24.220
 here of course very very little is possible 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:26.190
 look here but with you more a grams 

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:32.530
 see you next video 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:34.700
 give up notice the questions important to me 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:39.290
 What do you think 

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:41.920
 and the question of creating is definitely not wanting it 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:41.920
 occurs only 

00:06:42.169 --> 00:06:44.229
 with
