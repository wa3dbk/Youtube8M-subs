00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
all right so this is my seven it's a

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:10.549 
all right so this is my seven it's a
little<00:00:04.170> beat<00:00:04.319> up<00:00:06.770> anyway<00:00:08.870> this<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:09.990> a<00:00:10.050> video<00:00:10.320> to

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
little beat up anyway this is a video to

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.789 
little beat up anyway this is a video to
basically<00:00:10.769> show<00:00:11.639> you<00:00:11.700> what<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.179> other<00:00:12.300> video

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:12.799 
basically show you what the other video

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:20.410 
basically show you what the other video
had<00:00:14.330> to<00:00:15.330> see<00:00:15.540> there<00:00:15.859> my<00:00:17.630> keypad<00:00:18.630> right<00:00:18.810> there

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
had to see there my keypad right there

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.400 
had to see there my keypad right there
carpets<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.570> mess<00:00:21.810> I<00:00:22.170> know<00:00:24.470> so<00:00:25.470> basically<00:00:27.410> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
carpets a mess I know so basically the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:41.690 
carpets a mess I know so basically the
cables<00:00:28.890> run<00:00:29.220> under<00:00:30.980> here<00:00:40.070> but<00:00:41.070> they<00:00:41.219> run<00:00:41.399> under

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
cables run under here but they run under

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.200 
cables run under here but they run under
there<00:00:41.879> it's<00:00:42.510> under<00:00:42.809> this<00:00:42.989> keypad<00:00:44.000> and<00:00:45.000> when<00:00:45.120> it

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
there it's under this keypad and when it

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.590 
there it's under this keypad and when it
comes<00:00:45.450> out<00:00:45.719> through<00:00:46.710> this<00:00:46.860> cable<00:00:47.190> it's<00:00:48.149> like<00:00:48.360> I

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
comes out through this cable it's like I

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.350 
comes out through this cable it's like I
used<00:00:51.829> an<00:00:52.829> Ethernet<00:00:53.370> cable<00:00:53.719> but<00:00:56.000> the<00:00:57.000> copper

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
used an Ethernet cable but the copper

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.110 
used an Ethernet cable but the copper
inside<00:00:57.510> was<00:00:57.870> too<00:00:58.079> fragile<00:00:58.920> so<00:00:59.430> we<00:00:59.579> switched<00:00:59.879> to

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
inside was too fragile so we switched to

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.219 
inside was too fragile so we switched to
a<00:01:00.359> cable<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.730> used<00:01:02.730> on<00:01:03.000> those<00:01:03.239> automatic

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
a cable that used on those automatic

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.750 
a cable that used on those automatic
gates<00:01:06.290> where<00:01:07.290> you<00:01:07.470> drive<00:01:07.950> up<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.400> the<00:01:08.580> weight

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
gates where you drive up and the weight

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.300 
gates where you drive up and the weight
of<00:01:08.970> your<00:01:09.000> car<00:01:09.390> opens<00:01:09.750> up<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> gate<00:01:10.170> that's<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
of your car opens up the gate that's the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.039 
of your car opens up the gate that's the
kind<00:01:11.610> of<00:01:11.640> cable<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.150> used<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.659> it's<00:01:12.780> more

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
kind of cable that I used and it's more

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.100 
kind of cable that I used and it's more
durable<00:01:13.290> so<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:14.549> basically<00:01:14.700> runs<00:01:16.759> through<00:01:17.759> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
durable so it basically runs through the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.820 
durable so it basically runs through the
under<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.580> carpet<00:01:20.580> deal<00:01:21.470> all<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.710> way

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
under this carpet deal all the way

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:31.730 
under this carpet deal all the way
through<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.220> side<00:01:29.299> through<00:01:30.299> here<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
through the side through here on the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.030 
through the side through here on the
underside<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:35.570> what<00:01:36.570> do<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.659> call<00:01:36.869> it

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
underside of the what do you call it

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.800 
underside of the what do you call it
this<00:01:38.040> cover<00:01:38.610> right<00:01:38.880> here<00:01:39.650> and<00:01:41.750> there's<00:01:42.750> a

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
this cover right here and there's a

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.030 
this cover right here and there's a
battery<00:01:43.110> pack<00:01:44.990> here<00:01:45.990> right<00:01:46.500> under<00:01:46.860> the

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
battery pack here right under the

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
battery pack here right under the
steering<00:01:47.310> wheel<00:01:47.640> comb<00:01:48.000> column<00:01:48.840> cover<00:01:50.869> it<00:01:51.869> is

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
steering wheel comb column cover it is

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.929 
steering wheel comb column cover it is
not<00:01:52.140> connected<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.070> car's<00:01:53.700> electrical

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
not connected to the car's electrical

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:58.249 
not connected to the car's electrical
system<00:01:54.600> it's<00:01:54.780> totally<00:01:55.649> independent<00:01:56.219> so<00:01:57.259> the

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
system it's totally independent so the

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.160 
system it's totally independent so the
batteries<00:01:58.880> that's<00:01:59.880> me<00:02:00.180> anywhere<00:02:00.630> from<00:02:00.840> two<00:02:01.140> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
batteries that's me anywhere from two to

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.760 
batteries that's me anywhere from two to
three<00:02:01.649> years<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.930> it's<00:02:03.930> not<00:02:04.049> like<00:02:04.409> they<00:02:04.590> use<00:02:04.740> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
three years so it's not like they use a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.399 
three years so it's not like they use a
lot<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> switch<00:02:06.540> uses<00:02:07.110> a<00:02:07.140> lot<00:02:07.380> of

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
lot of the the switch uses a lot of

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.440 
lot of the the switch uses a lot of
energy<00:02:08.060> so<00:02:09.060> behind<00:02:09.629> this<00:02:09.869> trim

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
energy so behind this trim

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.900 
energy so behind this trim
where<00:02:12.280> the<00:02:13.300> switch<00:02:14.300> is<00:02:14.720> hiding<00:02:15.650> this<00:02:16.610> knob<00:02:16.879> is

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
where the switch is hiding this knob is

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:24.880 
where the switch is hiding this knob is
from<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:20.140> safe<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.379> I<00:02:21.440> was<00:02:21.730> tore<00:02:22.730> apart<00:02:23.890> this

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
from the safe that I was tore apart this

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.120 
from the safe that I was tore apart this
is<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.280> like<00:02:25.489> a<00:02:25.849> piece<00:02:26.239> of<00:02:26.269> metal<00:02:26.510> that<00:02:26.690> we

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
is just like a piece of metal that we

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.120 
is just like a piece of metal that we
used<00:02:28.130> to<00:02:28.310> kind<00:02:28.489> of<00:02:28.610> use<00:02:28.790> as<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.000> bracket<00:02:30.130> the

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
used to kind of use as a bracket the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.729 
used to kind of use as a bracket the
switch<00:02:31.550> the<00:02:32.239> actual<00:02:32.540> switch<00:02:32.780> is<00:02:32.959> in<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.200> back

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
switch the actual switch is in the back

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.759 
switch the actual switch is in the back
no<00:02:34.519> if<00:02:34.819> you<00:02:34.910> can<00:02:35.090> see<00:02:35.300> it<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.690> don't<00:02:36.349> really<00:02:36.470> want

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:36.769 
no if you can see it I don't really want

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.320 
no if you can see it I don't really want
to<00:02:36.830> take<00:02:36.980> apart<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.489> whole<00:02:37.640> thing<00:02:37.880> cause<00:02:38.120> it's

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:38.330 
to take apart the whole thing cause it's

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.930 
to take apart the whole thing cause it's
a<00:02:38.480> pain<00:02:38.720> in<00:02:38.810> the<00:02:38.900> butt<00:02:39.080> but<00:02:39.430> that<00:02:40.430> switch<00:02:40.730> is

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
a pain in the butt but that switch is

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.870 
a pain in the butt but that switch is
basically<00:02:41.420> always<00:02:42.049> behind<00:02:42.470> right<00:02:43.129> here<00:02:43.370> if

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
basically always behind right here if

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.870 
basically always behind right here if
you've<00:02:44.060> taken<00:02:44.299> this<00:02:45.220> whole<00:02:46.220> thing<00:02:46.430> apart<00:02:46.730> you

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
you've taken this whole thing apart you

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.940 
you've taken this whole thing apart you
know<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.239> there's<00:02:47.420> a<00:02:47.480> white<00:02:47.980> housing<00:02:49.299> where

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
know that there's a white housing where

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.449 
know that there's a white housing where
the<00:02:51.950> switch<00:02:52.160> is<00:02:52.340> connected<00:02:53.079> so<00:02:54.079> what<00:02:54.980> whatever

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
the switch is connected so what whatever

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.309 
the switch is connected so what whatever
was<00:02:55.670> back<00:02:55.849> here<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.569> is<00:02:56.630> now<00:02:57.049> here<00:02:57.970> and<00:02:59.110> this<00:03:00.110> is

00:03:00.309 --> 00:03:00.319 
was back here it is now here and this is

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.089 
was back here it is now here and this is
my<00:03:00.829> key<00:03:01.099> so<00:03:01.940> so<00:03:02.450> you<00:03:02.540> can<00:03:02.569> see<00:03:02.900> it's<00:03:03.140> locked<00:03:03.709> I

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099 
my key so so you can see it's locked I

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:10.089 
my key so so you can see it's locked I
can't<00:03:04.400> turn<00:03:04.700> it<00:03:05.380> but<00:03:06.380> I'm<00:03:07.250> gonna<00:03:08.980> punching<00:03:09.980> the

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:10.099 
can't turn it but I'm gonna punching the

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:18.580 
can't turn it but I'm gonna punching the
key<00:03:12.970> and<00:03:14.140> now<00:03:15.140> it<00:03:15.739> turns<00:03:17.109> and<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.200> can<00:03:18.380> see

that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:29.390 

turns<00:03:24.270> over<00:03:24.420> the<00:03:24.990> car<00:03:25.200> starts

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.589 

and

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.110 

if<00:03:33.260> you<00:03:33.379> can<00:03:33.530> see<00:03:33.829> right<00:03:34.010> here<00:03:34.069> this<00:03:34.849> is<00:03:35.090> a

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
if you can see right here this is a

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.380 
if you can see right here this is a
little<00:03:37.269> mechanism<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.510> retracts<00:03:39.469> that<00:03:39.829> pin

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
little mechanism that retracts that pin

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.860 
little mechanism that retracts that pin
and<00:03:41.390> that<00:03:41.599> when<00:03:41.930> I<00:03:41.959> put<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.349> the<00:03:42.469> right<00:03:42.620> code

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
and that when I put in the right code

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.119 
and that when I put in the right code
and

00:03:47.119 --> 00:03:47.129 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.970 

locks<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:48.000> when<00:03:48.209> I<00:03:48.239> turn<00:03:48.390> to<00:03:48.780> keep<00:03:51.769> to<00:03:52.769> hear

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:52.980 
locks it when I turn to keep to hear

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:53.390 
locks it when I turn to keep to hear
that

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
that

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.089 
that
that<00:03:53.849> was<00:03:54.030> the<00:03:54.269> pan<00:03:55.140> that<00:03:55.409> locks<00:03:55.650> this<00:03:58.099> again

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
that was the pan that locks this again

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:13.470 
that was the pan that locks this again
I'm<00:03:59.840> putting<00:04:00.840> the<00:04:01.079> key<00:04:01.849> code<00:04:06.470> turns

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.650 

the<00:04:13.780> car<00:04:13.989> starts

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.770 

and<00:04:17.980> that's<00:04:18.980> basically<00:04:19.489> how<00:04:19.880> it<00:04:20.030> works

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 
and that's basically how it works

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.450 
and that's basically how it works
I<00:04:21.520> will<00:04:23.830> try<00:04:24.830> to<00:04:24.860> make<00:04:25.160> a<00:04:26.590> new<00:04:27.590> write-up<00:04:28.130> if<00:04:28.340> I

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
I will try to make a new write-up if I

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.620 
I will try to make a new write-up if I
can't<00:04:28.700> find<00:04:28.910> the<00:04:29.090> original<00:04:29.180> one<00:04:29.720> and<00:04:31.510> so<00:04:32.510> you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
can't find the original one and so you

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:39.610 
can't find the original one and so you
can<00:04:32.810> see<00:04:33.550> how<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.780> wired<00:04:35.780> it<00:04:35.990> all<00:04:36.140> up<00:04:36.380> and<00:04:38.620> hope

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
can see how I wired it all up and hope

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.520 
can see how I wired it all up and hope
it<00:04:39.740> helps<00:04:39.980> or<00:04:40.490> whoever<00:04:40.760> wants<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.090> try<00:04:41.270> this

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
it helps or whoever wants to try this

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.530 
it helps or whoever wants to try this
piece
