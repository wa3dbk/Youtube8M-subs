00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 
complete disaster name this game first

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.590 
complete disaster name this game first
came<00:03:23.980> out<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.640> then<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.060> realized<00:03:25.420> that

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
came out and then I realized that

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.180 
came out and then I realized that
there's<00:03:25.780> like<00:03:25.930> a<00:03:25.959> few<00:03:26.320> ways<00:03:26.500> to<00:03:26.530> play<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:26.920> map

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
there's like a few ways to play this map

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
there's like a few ways to play this map
and<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.640> two<00:03:27.850> ways<00:03:28.000> that<00:03:28.150> i<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.269> of<00:03:28.480> is<00:03:28.660> like

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
and the two ways that i know of is like

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.870 
and the two ways that i know of is like
a<00:03:29.019> first<00:03:29.680> way<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:30.280> can<00:03:30.430> go<00:03:30.519> ahead<00:03:30.580> and<00:03:30.700> use

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
a first way you can go ahead and use

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.759 
a first way you can go ahead and use
shotguns<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.660> SMGs<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.440> just<00:03:32.590> always

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
shotguns and SMGs and just always

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.520 
shotguns and SMGs and just always
rushing<00:03:33.310> inside<00:03:33.430> of<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> actual<00:03:34.209> bio<00:03:34.720> lab<00:03:35.110> and

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.530 
rushing inside of the actual bio lab and

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:37.320 
rushing inside of the actual bio lab and
then<00:03:35.890> the<00:03:36.010> second<00:03:36.340> way<00:03:36.459> of<00:03:36.580> course<00:03:36.760> is<00:03:37.060> like

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
then the second way of course is like

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.229 
then the second way of course is like
just<00:03:37.630> having<00:03:38.080> an<00:03:38.350> AAR<00:03:38.739> having<00:03:39.220> an<00:03:39.280> lmg<00:03:39.700> just

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
just having an AAR having an lmg just

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:41.880 
just having an AAR having an lmg just
staying<00:03:40.540> on<00:03:40.720> top<00:03:41.019> of<00:03:41.049> the<00:03:41.260> building<00:03:41.470> it's<00:03:41.709> all
