00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
back as a fighter jet so really giving

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.150 
back as a fighter jet so really giving
you<00:01:53.660> this<00:01:53.810> feeling<00:01:54.230> of<00:01:54.380> oh<00:01:54.620> wow<00:01:54.890> there's

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.160 
you this feeling of oh wow there's

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.380 
you this feeling of oh wow there's
really<00:01:55.880> powerful<00:01:56.360> ships<00:01:56.570> around<00:01:56.810> me<00:01:58.390> they

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
really powerful ships around me they

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:00.880 
really powerful ships around me they
will<00:01:59.540> shoot<00:01:59.660> me<00:01:59.810> down<00:01:59.900> in<00:02:00.080> an<00:02:00.170> instant<00:02:00.560> really

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
will shoot me down in an instant really

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.920 
will shoot me down in an instant really
but<00:02:01.100> I<00:02:01.130> can<00:02:01.340> still<00:02:01.550> influence<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:02.360> battle<00:02:02.630> and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
but I can still influence the battle and

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.780 
but I can still influence the battle and
so<00:02:03.560> what<00:02:03.680> are<00:02:03.770> the<00:02:03.860> three<00:02:04.040> types<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.430> ships<00:02:04.610> you

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
so what are the three types of ships you

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.280 
so what are the three types of ships you
guys<00:02:04.940> are<00:02:05.090> experimenting<00:02:05.690> with<00:02:05.720> for<00:02:06.140> these

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
guys are experimenting with for these

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:09.639 
guys are experimenting with for these
revival<00:02:07.010> ships<00:02:07.220> so<00:02:08.060> for<00:02:08.479> the<00:02:08.840> fighter<00:02:09.380> jets

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
revival ships so for the fighter jets

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.760 
revival ships so for the fighter jets
it's<00:02:09.950> currently<00:02:10.280> a<00:02:10.990> offense<00:02:11.990> defense<00:02:12.230> and

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:12.770 
it's currently a offense defense and

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.190 
it's currently a offense defense and
something<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.250> between<00:02:13.310> so<00:02:13.790> far<00:02:14.720> a<00:02:14.750> chat<00:02:14.990> with

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
something in between so far a chat with

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.020 
something in between so far a chat with
mrs.<00:02:15.440> a<00:02:15.590> fighter<00:02:16.100> jet<00:02:16.310> with<00:02:16.550> defensive

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
mrs. a fighter jet with defensive

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.300

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
you can either support dreadnaughts with

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.920 
you can either support dreadnaughts with
shooting<00:02:22.670> down<00:02:22.820> incoming<00:02:23.330> missiles<00:02:23.780> and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:23.930 
shooting down incoming missiles and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.810 
shooting down incoming missiles and
things<00:02:24.050> like<00:02:24.140> that<00:02:24.200> or<00:02:24.650> actually<00:02:25.340> attack

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
things like that or actually attack

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.910 
things like that or actually attack
other<00:02:26.209> players<00:02:26.540> weather<00:02:26.810> and<00:02:27.200> the<00:02:27.230> cool<00:02:27.890> thing

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:27.920 
other players weather and the cool thing

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.010 
other players weather and the cool thing
about<00:02:28.160> is<00:02:28.400> that<00:02:28.640> that<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.180> really<00:02:29.570> can<00:02:29.780> have

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
about is that that you really can have

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.800 
about is that that you really can have
those<00:02:30.370> apollo<00:02:31.370> starbucks<00:02:32.030> type<00:02:32.270> moments

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
those apollo starbucks type moments

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:34.150 
those apollo starbucks type moments
where<00:02:33.110> you<00:02:33.230> actually<00:02:33.500> take<00:02:33.830> something<00:02:34.130> down

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
where you actually take something down

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.130 
where you actually take something down
and<00:02:34.489> what<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.239> wanted<00:02:35.480> to<00:02:35.540> achieve<00:02:35.690> with<00:02:36.020> this

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
and what we wanted to achieve with this

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.070 
and what we wanted to achieve with this
is<00:02:36.440> that<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:37.580> don't<00:02:37.700> really<00:02:38.300> want<00:02:38.570> people<00:02:38.930> to

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
is that you don't really want people to

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.630 
is that you don't really want people to
go<00:02:39.200> in<00:02:39.410> there<00:02:39.590> as<00:02:39.800> kind<00:02:40.250> of<00:02:40.280> a<00:02:40.370> band<00:02:40.550> of

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
go in there as kind of a band of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.610 
go in there as kind of a band of
brothers<00:02:40.970> thing<00:02:41.330> so<00:02:41.600> like<00:02:41.870> really<00:02:42.260> have<00:02:42.440> this

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
brothers thing so like really have this

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.940 
brothers thing so like really have this
connection<00:02:43.000> between<00:02:44.000> captains<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.380> have

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
connection between captains and have

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.040 
connection between captains and have
them<00:02:46.130> move<00:02:46.280> together<00:02:46.520> as<00:02:46.790> a<00:02:47.150> squad<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:47.750> fleet

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
them move together as a squad as a fleet

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.770 
them move together as a squad as a fleet
of<00:02:48.260> captains<00:02:48.770> so<00:02:49.310> normally<00:02:49.910> in<00:02:50.209> simulation

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
of captains so normally in simulation

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.840 
of captains so normally in simulation
modes<00:02:51.110> it<00:02:51.650> is<00:02:51.830> very<00:02:52.040> much<00:02:52.100> possible<00:02:52.340> that<00:02:52.700> when

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
modes it is very much possible that when

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.910 
modes it is very much possible that when
you<00:02:52.940> die<00:02:53.120> you<00:02:53.180> actually<00:02:53.690> just<00:02:53.720> leave<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.739> game

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
you die you actually just leave the game

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.280 
you die you actually just leave the game
and<00:02:55.160> jump<00:02:55.370> to<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.580> next<00:02:55.610> next<00:02:56.269> game<00:02:56.570> leaving

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
and jump to the next next game leaving

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:58.449 
and jump to the next next game leaving
your<00:02:57.380> guys<00:02:57.530> behind<00:02:57.769> because<00:02:58.070> you<00:02:58.190> can't<00:02:58.370> do

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
your guys behind because you can't do

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.220 
your guys behind because you can't do
anything<00:02:58.489> about<00:02:58.820> it<00:02:58.910> anyhow<00:02:59.299> and<00:02:59.540> with<00:03:00.080> this

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
anything about it anyhow and with this

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.530 
anything about it anyhow and with this
we<00:03:00.290> really<00:03:00.709> want<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.070> create<00:03:01.850> this<00:03:02.030> feeling<00:03:02.390> of

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
we really want to create this feeling of

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.009 
we really want to create this feeling of
hey<00:03:03.320> I'm<00:03:03.830> not<00:03:04.310> I'm<00:03:05.120> dad<00:03:05.360> like<00:03:05.600> I<00:03:05.690> will<00:03:05.840> shut

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:06.019 
hey I'm not I'm dad like I will shut

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:07.600 
hey I'm not I'm dad like I will shut
down<00:03:06.049> but<00:03:06.440> I'm<00:03:06.530> not<00:03:06.709> leaving<00:03:07.070> you<00:03:07.100> behind<00:03:07.250> like

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
down but I'm not leaving you behind like

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.039 
down but I'm not leaving you behind like
I<00:03:07.700> will<00:03:07.880> still<00:03:08.060> contribute<00:03:08.480> as<00:03:08.600> much<00:03:08.630> as<00:03:08.930> I<00:03:08.989> can

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
I will still contribute as much as I can

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.539 
I will still contribute as much as I can
and<00:03:09.350> try<00:03:09.500> to<00:03:09.560> turn<00:03:09.739> this<00:03:09.799> around<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.370> then

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:10.549 
and try to turn this around and then

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:12.580 
and try to turn this around and then
hopefully<00:03:11.330> create<00:03:11.600> those<00:03:11.780> experiences<00:03:12.410> where

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
hopefully create those experiences where

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.620 
hopefully create those experiences where
people<00:03:12.950> get<00:03:13.400> together<00:03:13.580> in<00:03:13.940> a<00:03:14.000> sport<00:03:14.330> and<00:03:14.480> then

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
people get together in a sport and then

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:15.780 
people get together in a sport and then
move<00:03:14.870> from<00:03:15.049> games<00:03:15.290> again

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
move from games again

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.660 
move from games again
and<00:03:16.290> then<00:03:17.290> on<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.680> note<00:03:17.739> progression<00:03:18.610> is

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
and then on that note progression is

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.459 
and then on that note progression is
probably<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.060> big<00:03:19.269> deal<00:03:19.450> on<00:03:19.480> this<00:03:19.780> out<00:03:20.260> of<00:03:20.409> the

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:20.469 
probably a big deal on this out of the

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:22.679 
probably a big deal on this out of the
five<00:03:20.650> classes<00:03:21.310> how<00:03:21.790> can<00:03:21.969> you<00:03:22.000> progress<00:03:22.329> you

00:03:22.679 --> 00:03:22.689 
five classes how can you progress you

00:03:22.689 --> 00:03:24.890 
five classes how can you progress you
customize<00:03:23.140> those<00:03:23.349> ships<00:03:23.680> you<00:03:23.920> buy<00:03:24.069> new<00:03:24.310> ships

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
customize those ships you buy new ships

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.509 
customize those ships you buy new ships
so<00:03:25.900> there's<00:03:26.109> going<00:03:26.590> to<00:03:26.680> be<00:03:26.709> multiple<00:03:27.280> ships

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
so there's going to be multiple ships

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.429 
so there's going to be multiple ships
within<00:03:27.790> each<00:03:28.060> class<00:03:28.329> so<00:03:28.750> currently<00:03:29.200> we're

00:03:29.429 --> 00:03:29.439 
within each class so currently we're

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.819 
within each class so currently we're
aiming<00:03:29.590> for<00:03:29.739> something<00:03:29.980> between<00:03:30.310> 12<00:03:30.819> and<00:03:31.030> 15

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
aiming for something between 12 and 15

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:34.559 
aiming for something between 12 and 15
will<00:03:32.829> probably<00:03:33.519> expand<00:03:33.849> on<00:03:34.000> that<00:03:34.030> depending

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
will probably expand on that depending

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.710 
will probably expand on that depending
on how<00:03:34.930> how<00:03:35.470> well<00:03:35.769> it<00:03:35.950> is<00:03:36.069> perceived<00:03:36.430> and<00:03:36.939> then

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
on how how well it is perceived and then

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.080 
on how how well it is perceived and then
we<00:03:37.870> have<00:03:37.959> each<00:03:38.709> ship<00:03:39.010> has<00:03:39.310> for<00:03:39.670> ability<00:03:40.000> scores

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
we have each ship has for ability scores

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.920 
we have each ship has for ability scores
right<00:03:40.510> now<00:03:40.720> so<00:03:41.280> we<00:03:42.280> will<00:03:42.310> have<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:43.030> think<00:03:43.720> at<00:03:43.870> the

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
right now so we will have I think at the

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:45.869 
right now so we will have I think at the
moment<00:03:43.959> it's<00:03:44.290> 80<00:03:44.560> plus<00:03:44.980> abilities<00:03:45.519> that<00:03:45.730> we

00:03:45.869 --> 00:03:45.879 
moment it's 80 plus abilities that we

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:47.789 
moment it's 80 plus abilities that we
are<00:03:45.969> aiming<00:03:46.090> for<00:03:46.389> and<00:03:46.659> there's<00:03:47.379> also<00:03:47.560> going<00:03:47.739> to

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
are aiming for and there's also going to

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.649 
are aiming for and there's also going to
be<00:03:47.859> crew<00:03:48.099> members<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.760> the<00:03:48.909> ship<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:49.389> those

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 
be crew members on the ship so those

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.330 
be crew members on the ship so those
peeps<00:03:49.959> blue<00:03:50.230> members<00:03:50.590> will<00:03:50.829> actually<00:03:51.159> gain

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
peeps blue members will actually gain

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.369 
peeps blue members will actually gain
experience<00:03:51.909> and<00:03:52.150> with<00:03:52.780> this<00:03:52.870> experience

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:53.379 
experience and with this experience

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.869 
experience and with this experience
gained<00:03:53.590> additional<00:03:53.859> skills<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.639> are<00:03:54.730> going

00:03:54.869 --> 00:03:54.879 
gained additional skills that are going

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:56.520 
gained additional skills that are going
to<00:03:54.970> send<00:03:55.150> to<00:03:55.329> them<00:03:55.480> during<00:03:55.840> the<00:03:56.019> game<00:03:56.169> session

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:56.530 
to send to them during the game session

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.280 
to send to them during the game session
so<00:03:57.040> but<00:03:57.970> from<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:58.209> overarching<00:03:58.720> progression

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
so but from the overarching progression

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.710 
so but from the overarching progression
for<00:03:59.650> you<00:03:59.829> as<00:04:00.129> a<00:04:00.159> captain<00:04:00.849> there's<00:04:01.419> going<00:04:01.599> to<00:04:01.689> be

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:01.720 
for you as a captain there's going to be

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.929 
for you as a captain there's going to be
multiple<00:04:02.379> pro-russian<00:04:02.799> trees<00:04:02.980> below<00:04:03.609> them

00:04:03.929 --> 00:04:03.939 
multiple pro-russian trees below them

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:06.270 
multiple pro-russian trees below them
how<00:04:04.659> about<00:04:04.870> visual<00:04:05.230> customization<00:04:06.010> there's

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
how about visual customization there's

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.140 
how about visual customization there's
going<00:04:06.489> to<00:04:06.549> be<00:04:06.579> a<00:04:06.639> lot<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.849> visual

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
going to be a lot of visual

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.059 
going to be a lot of visual
customization<00:04:07.750> yeah<00:04:07.900> for<00:04:08.109> sure<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.470> mean<00:04:08.919> it's

00:04:09.059 --> 00:04:09.069 
customization yeah for sure I mean it's

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.000 
customization yeah for sure I mean it's
giant<00:04:09.250> spaceship<00:04:09.669> so<00:04:10.319> we<00:04:11.319> keep<00:04:11.530> saying<00:04:11.769> we

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
giant spaceship so we keep saying we

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.399 
giant spaceship so we keep saying we
have<00:04:12.159> the<00:04:12.370> the<00:04:12.810> biggest<00:04:13.810> heads<00:04:14.139> in<00:04:14.319> the

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:14.409 
have the the biggest heads in the

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:16.740 
have the the biggest heads in the
industry<00:04:14.769> so<00:04:15.040> our<00:04:15.310> our<00:04:15.639> hats<00:04:15.970> are<00:04:16.239> bigger

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
industry so our our hats are bigger

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.110 
industry so our our hats are bigger
heads<00:04:16.959> and<00:04:17.229> they're<00:04:17.349> like<00:04:17.560> 30<00:04:18.489> meters<00:04:18.880> tall

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:19.120 
heads and they're like 30 meters tall

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.909 
heads and they're like 30 meters tall
honestly<00:04:19.750> probably<00:04:20.049> my<00:04:20.260> artists<00:04:20.590> would<00:04:20.709> kill

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
honestly probably my artists would kill

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:22.200 
honestly probably my artists would kill
me<00:04:21.039> for<00:04:21.070> this<00:04:21.250> number<00:04:21.820> because<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.030> don't

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:22.210 
me for this number because I don't

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:24.029 
me for this number because I don't
really<00:04:22.389> know<00:04:22.599> how<00:04:22.720> tall<00:04:23.199> there<00:04:23.409> are<00:04:23.800> they<00:04:23.949> are

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
really know how tall there are they are

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:26.430 
really know how tall there are they are
really<00:04:24.159> picked<00:04:24.400> on<00:04:25.169> there's<00:04:26.169> going<00:04:26.349> to<00:04:26.409> be

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
really picked on there's going to be

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.129 
really picked on there's going to be
paying<00:04:26.830> jobs<00:04:27.190> for<00:04:27.430> the<00:04:27.580> bother<00:04:28.570> ships<00:04:28.870> there's

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
paying jobs for the bother ships there's

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:30.629 
paying jobs for the bother ships there's
going<00:04:29.289> to<00:04:29.349> be<00:04:29.380> additional<00:04:29.979> attachments<00:04:30.490> for

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
going to be additional attachments for

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:32.430 
going to be additional attachments for
the<00:04:30.729> ship's<00:04:30.940> there's<00:04:31.180> going<00:04:31.330> to<00:04:31.389> be<00:04:31.440> giant

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
the ship's there's going to be giant

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.260 
the ship's there's going to be giant
globos<00:04:32.860> that<00:04:33.220> you<00:04:33.280> can<00:04:33.370> paint<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.880> the<00:04:34.000> side<00:04:34.240> of

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
globos that you can paint on the side of

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:35.760 
globos that you can paint on the side of
the<00:04:34.479> ship<00:04:34.510> so<00:04:34.810> there's<00:04:35.110> a<00:04:35.199> lot<00:04:35.289> of<00:04:35.349> options

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
the ship so there's a lot of options

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.500 
the ship so there's a lot of options
then<00:04:35.889> then<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.520> huge<00:04:36.760> change<00:04:36.970> we<00:04:37.180> noticed

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
then then a huge change we noticed

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:38.820 
then then a huge change we noticed
compared<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:37.960> previous<00:04:38.320> coverage<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.770> the

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
compared to previous coverage of the

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.040 
compared to previous coverage of the
game<00:04:39.010> is<00:04:39.280> the<00:04:39.849> changes<00:04:40.270> to<00:04:40.389> the<00:04:40.419> energy<00:04:40.780> system

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
game is the changes to the energy system

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:42.750 
game is the changes to the energy system
can<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:41.889> tell<00:04:42.099> us<00:04:42.130> what<00:04:42.400> you've<00:04:42.580> done<00:04:42.699> with

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
can you tell us what you've done with

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.070 
can you tell us what you've done with
energy<00:04:43.120> system<00:04:43.449> in<00:04:43.539> terms<00:04:43.570> of<00:04:43.810> the<00:04:43.900> full

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
energy system in terms of the full

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.750 
energy system in terms of the full
throttle<00:04:44.380> instead<00:04:44.889> of<00:04:45.010> the<00:04:45.099> separate<00:04:45.550> like

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:45.760 
throttle instead of the separate like

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:47.850 
throttle instead of the separate like
ten<00:04:46.060> percent<00:04:46.449> power<00:04:46.930> thirty<00:04:47.710> percent

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
ten percent power thirty percent

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.760 
ten percent power thirty percent
dressers<00:04:48.400> we<00:04:48.550> had<00:04:48.669> before<00:04:48.820> and<00:04:49.150> so<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> ten

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
dressers we had before and so the ten

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:51.779 
dressers we had before and so the ten
percent<00:04:51.070> thing<00:04:51.220> was<00:04:51.370> something<00:04:51.580> that<00:04:51.610> we

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
percent thing was something that we

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.210 
percent thing was something that we
experimented<00:04:52.270> with<00:04:52.599> in<00:04:53.199> the<00:04:53.380> early<00:04:53.680> days<00:04:53.830> like

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
experimented with in the early days like

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.969 
experimented with in the early days like
we<00:04:54.970> really<00:04:55.120> want<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:55.419> do<00:04:55.510> good<00:04:55.659> like<00:04:56.289> managing

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
we really want to do good like managing

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:58.320 
we really want to do good like managing
energy<00:04:57.190> is<00:04:57.460> an<00:04:57.550> integral<00:04:57.909> part<00:04:57.970> of<00:04:58.210> the

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
energy is an integral part of the

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.790 
energy is an integral part of the
fantasy<00:04:58.479> of<00:04:58.750> being<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.110> captain<00:04:59.349> right<00:04:59.500> like

00:04:59.790 --> 00:04:59.800 
fantasy of being a captain right like

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.010 
fantasy of being a captain right like
gcp<00:05:00.370> car<00:05:00.580> sitting<00:05:01.120> in<00:05:01.210> his<00:05:01.270> chance<00:05:01.630> like<00:05:01.810> all

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
gcp car sitting in his chance like all

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.320 
gcp car sitting in his chance like all
energy<00:05:02.349> two<00:05:02.409> engines<00:05:02.830> and<00:05:03.099> who<00:05:03.880> really<00:05:04.120> wants

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
energy two engines and who really wants

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.899 
energy two engines and who really wants
to<00:05:04.449> replicate<00:05:04.900> this<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.400> in<00:05:06.400> the<00:05:06.580> beginning

00:05:06.899 --> 00:05:06.909 
to replicate this and in the beginning

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:10.080 
to replicate this and in the beginning
we<00:05:07.060> tried<00:05:07.270> this<00:05:07.449> very<00:05:08.010> fragile<00:05:09.010> system<00:05:09.699> where

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
we tried this very fragile system where

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.629 
we tried this very fragile system where
you<00:05:10.180> were<00:05:11.110> able<00:05:11.380> to<00:05:11.620> assign<00:05:11.889> energy<00:05:12.310> like<00:05:12.520> in

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:12.639 
you were able to assign energy like in

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:14.430 
you were able to assign energy like in
five<00:05:12.820> percent<00:05:13.180> steps<00:05:13.479> so<00:05:13.780> it<00:05:13.900> was<00:05:14.050> a<00:05:14.080> constant

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
five percent steps so it was a constant

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:17.159 
five percent steps so it was a constant
micromanagement<00:05:15.310> type<00:05:15.639> of<00:05:15.759> effort<00:05:16.050> which<00:05:17.050> is

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
micromanagement type of effort which is

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.420 
micromanagement type of effort which is
not<00:05:17.289> what<00:05:17.320> we<00:05:17.530> wanted<00:05:17.770> to<00:05:17.830> do<00:05:17.949> like

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:18.430 
not what we wanted to do like

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.160 
not what we wanted to do like
wanted<00:05:18.700> to<00:05:18.730> have<00:05:19.000> an<00:05:19.210> energy<00:05:19.390> simulator<00:05:19.990> in

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:20.170 
wanted to have an energy simulator in

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.260 
wanted to have an energy simulator in
the<00:05:20.200> game<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:20.950> we<00:05:21.130> still<00:05:21.610> wanted<00:05:21.880> to<00:05:22.000> recreate

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
the game but we still wanted to recreate

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:24.660 
the game but we still wanted to recreate
this<00:05:22.480> feeling<00:05:22.840> so<00:05:23.280> with<00:05:24.280> the<00:05:24.370> click<00:05:24.520> of<00:05:24.580> a

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:24.670 
this feeling so with the click of a

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:26.640 
this feeling so with the click of a
button<00:05:24.700> now<00:05:25.120> you<00:05:25.360> can<00:05:25.540> reassign<00:05:26.020> energy<00:05:26.440> to

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:26.650 
button now you can reassign energy to

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:29.100 
button now you can reassign energy to
engine<00:05:27.040> energy<00:05:27.820> to<00:05:27.850> weapons<00:05:28.060> or<00:05:28.750> energy<00:05:29.080> to

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
engine energy to weapons or energy to

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.760 
engine energy to weapons or energy to
shields<00:05:29.560> so<00:05:30.220> it's<00:05:30.400> really<00:05:30.580> something<00:05:31.620> that<00:05:32.620> is

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
shields so it's really something that is

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:35.940 
shields so it's really something that is
very<00:05:32.800> intuitive<00:05:33.580> and<00:05:33.700> quick<00:05:34.740> fantastic<00:05:35.740> I'm

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
very intuitive and quick fantastic I'm

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:37.080 
very intuitive and quick fantastic I'm
not<00:05:36.130> gonna<00:05:36.250> be<00:05:36.370> one<00:05:36.460> of<00:05:36.490> the<00:05:36.580> press<00:05:36.760> that<00:05:36.940> bugs

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
not gonna be one of the press that bugs

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.640 
not gonna be one of the press that bugs
