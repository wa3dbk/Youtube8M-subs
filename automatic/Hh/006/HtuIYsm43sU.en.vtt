you're not using an Ethernet cable
this<00:01:04.470> is<00:01:04.739> aka<00:01:05.430> possible<00:01:06.030> problems<00:01:06.360> so<00:01:06.840> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
this is aka possible problems so in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.990 
this is aka possible problems so in
order<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.470> fix<00:01:07.770> that<00:01:07.920> problem<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.610> boot<00:01:08.880> into

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
order to fix that problem you boot into

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.660 
order to fix that problem you boot into
your<00:01:09.180> recovery<00:01:09.510> mode<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:10.610> losing<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
your recovery mode and losing the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.090 
your recovery mode and losing the
recovery<00:01:12.030> mode<00:01:12.210> is<00:01:12.330> pretty<00:01:12.360> easy<00:01:12.720> just<00:01:13.170> hold

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
recovery mode is pretty easy just hold

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:24.980 
recovery mode is pretty easy just hold
the<00:01:14.220> power<00:01:14.400> button<00:01:15.439> until<00:01:23.600> most<00:01:24.600> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.780> time

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the power button until most of the time

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.749 
the power button until most of the time
it<00:01:25.140> will<00:01:25.229> end<00:01:25.500> up<00:01:25.650> doing<00:01:25.979> a<00:01:26.040> fourth<00:01:26.310> power<00:01:26.520> off

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
it will end up doing a fourth power off

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.330 
it will end up doing a fourth power off
but<00:01:26.970> you<00:01:27.060> do<00:01:27.210> it<00:01:27.240> again<00:01:27.570> hold<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.280> when<00:01:29.280> you

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but you do it again hold it when you

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.069 
but you do it again hold it when you
hear<00:01:29.490> it<00:01:29.520> beep<00:01:29.759> twice<00:01:30.590> you<00:01:31.590> let<00:01:31.770> go<00:01:35.869> hi<00:01:36.869> there

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
hear it beep twice you let go hi there

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.469 
hear it beep twice you let go hi there
and<00:01:39.650> you'd<00:01:40.650> have<00:01:40.770> to<00:01:40.920> use<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.700> USB<00:01:42.030> cable

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
and you'd have to use a USB cable

00:01:42.479 --> 00:02:01.590 
and you'd have to use a USB cable
connected

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600

have<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.410> wipe<00:02:12.530> your<00:02:12.709> hard<00:02:12.830> drive<00:02:13.129> or<00:02:13.250> anything

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
have to wipe your hard drive or anything

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.190 
have to wipe your hard drive or anything
if<00:02:13.640> it's<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.970> a<00:02:14.060> Wi-Fi<00:02:14.390> problem<00:02:14.780> just<00:02:14.959> go<00:02:15.080> up

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
if it's just a Wi-Fi problem just go up

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.119 
if it's just a Wi-Fi problem just go up
here<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.470> press<00:02:15.940> restore<00:02:16.940> default<00:02:17.269> settings

00:02:18.119 --> 00:02:18.129 
here and press restore default settings

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.030 
here and press restore default settings
so<00:02:19.129> I<00:02:19.370> don't<00:02:19.670> think<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.239> wipes<00:02:20.810> users<00:02:21.590> or

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
so I don't think that wipes users or

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.530 
so I don't think that wipes users or
anything<00:02:22.310> yeah<00:02:22.700> it<00:02:22.849> shouldn't<00:02:23.060> it<00:02:23.329> doesn't<00:02:24.019> so

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
anything yeah it shouldn't it doesn't so

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.300 
anything yeah it shouldn't it doesn't so

you would and it really had nothing to
lose<00:02:36.940> but<00:02:37.940> it<00:02:38.420> should<00:02:38.599> reboot<00:02:38.900> and<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.260> go

back<00:02:39.500> into<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.829> system<00:02:40.040> because<00:02:40.549> your<00:02:40.819> Wi-Fi

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
back into the system because your Wi-Fi

back into the system because your Wi-Fi
settings<00:02:41.299> you<00:02:42.260> know<00:02:42.349> like<00:02:42.700> the<00:02:43.700> HDTV<00:02:44.450> stuff

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
settings you know like the HDTV stuff

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.170

be<00:02:47.209> reset<00:02:47.750> and<00:02:48.819> I<00:02:49.819> think<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.390> think<00:02:50.540> to<00:02:50.599> also

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
be reset and I think I think to also

be reset and I think I think to also
included<00:02:52.310> your<00:02:52.489> resolution<00:02:53.329> but<00:03:01.780> yeah<00:03:02.780> that's

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
included your resolution but yeah that's

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.420 
included your resolution but yeah that's
how<00:03:03.290> you<00:03:03.350> do<00:03:03.500> recovery<00:03:03.829> mode<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:04.040> it's<00:03:04.340> also

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
how you do recovery mode and it's also

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.259 
how you do recovery mode and it's also
how<00:03:04.670> to<00:03:04.700> fix<00:03:05.829> the<00:03:06.829> surprisingly<00:03:07.340> common<00:03:07.790> Wi-Fi

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
how to fix the surprisingly common Wi-Fi

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.800 
how to fix the surprisingly common Wi-Fi
corruption<00:03:08.959> problem<00:03:09.290> and<00:03:09.880> you<00:03:10.880> could<00:03:11.060> go<00:03:11.239> to<00:03:11.750> a

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
corruption problem and you could go to a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.949 
corruption problem and you could go to a
different<00:03:12.430> Wi-Fi<00:03:13.430> network<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.630> I<00:03:14.660> would

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:14.959 
different Wi-Fi network but I would

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:17.080 
different Wi-Fi network but I would
highly<00:03:15.440> suggest<00:03:15.620> an<00:03:16.100> Ethernet<00:03:16.519> cable<00:03:16.670> because

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
highly suggest an Ethernet cable because

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.059 
highly suggest an Ethernet cable because
it's<00:03:17.269> much<00:03:17.480> more<00:03:17.660> reliable<00:03:18.139> uses<00:03:18.470> like<00:03:18.620> less

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
it's much more reliable uses like less

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.089 
it's much more reliable uses like less
electricity<00:03:19.430> and<00:03:19.760> it<00:03:20.359> is<00:03:20.590> faster<00:03:21.590> most<00:03:21.920> of

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
electricity and it is faster most of

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.690 
electricity and it is faster most of
time<00:03:22.510> that's<00:03:23.510> it
