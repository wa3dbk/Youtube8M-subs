 de corocoro has taken images of the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.970
 new pokemon movie in 2016 but 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.860
 the important thing is not the movie but the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.329
 pokemon in question that comes out in these 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.950
 images that you are seeing 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.690
 Following are many rumors 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.760
 many are the stories and many are 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.100
 the data they have given us and they all go to 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 stop to the same thing that is mega fígar 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.180
 everything is thought to be mega cig 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.510
 burns or that it can be a new way of 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.460
 cig burns or even a first pokemon 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.020
 of the new generation remember that the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.450
 latest games why have they been xy 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 after the mega blond remakes and 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.810
 alpha sapphire therefore what could 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.510
 to say is that now I should touch a 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.100
 new delivery of x as happened with 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.379
 ruby and sapphire and then the 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.119
 emerald with diamond and pearl and after 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.880
 came out the platinum everything will indicate of 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.280
 what can this time be a plus of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.960
 pokemon xe and therefore it should be 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.700
 pokemon z apart from those of game freak 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.409
 They are always very smart and always looking 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.759
 the rumors of what you're looking for the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.010
 people and what people are asking for 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.740
 they transform it somehow and 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.030
 based on what the fans want 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.560
 is very clever and sure that these rumors 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
 of pokemon z that everyone is 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.270
 speaking lately they have reached their 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.649
 ears and are in the process of translating it into 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.259
 your own game then if you call 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.659
 pokemon zeta or is not another subject is another 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.429
 story and if the protagonist is to get 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.810
 of or not is sting because this pokemon 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.729
 It can be giant or it might not be 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.170
 obviously it has to be a little 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.549
 legendary by noses because in all 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.229
