water in it it has an edge on it but
it's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.460> that<00:01:32.700> sharp<00:01:32.939> as<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.750> I'm

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it's not that sharp as you can see I'm

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.380 
it's not that sharp as you can see I'm
just<00:01:34.740> pressing<00:01:34.979> straight<00:01:35.340> down<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.060> it's<00:01:36.210> not

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
just pressing straight down and it's not

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.030 
just pressing straight down and it's not
really<00:01:36.780> cutting<00:01:37.140> me<00:01:38.450> if<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:40.200> slide<00:01:40.740> it<00:01:40.920> across

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
really cutting me if I slide it across

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.940 
really cutting me if I slide it across
like<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.759> it<00:01:42.540> could<00:01:42.720> probably<00:01:42.960> scratch<00:01:43.710> me

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
like that it could probably scratch me

it's<00:01:46.229> really<00:01:46.380> not<00:01:46.590> going<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.829> be<00:01:47.159> much<00:01:47.399> of<00:01:47.430> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
it's really not going to be much of a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.889 
it's really not going to be much of a
cut<00:01:48.409> but<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.530> does<00:01:49.710> have<00:01:49.920> some<00:01:50.189> sort<00:01:50.430> of<00:01:50.490> edge

00:01:50.889 --> 00:01:50.899

well my brother

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.459 
well my brother
Kimmo<00:01:55.829> kid<00:01:56.100> and<00:01:56.490> he<00:01:57.119> was<00:01:57.270> cutting<00:01:57.780> or<00:01:58.409> ripping

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
Kimmo kid and he was cutting or ripping

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.190 
Kimmo kid and he was cutting or ripping
milk<00:01:59.430> jugs<00:01:59.790> with<00:02:00.030> this<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.450> this<00:02:00.630> much<00:02:00.899> of<00:02:01.079> his

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
milk jugs with this and this much of his

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.490 
milk jugs with this and this much of his
tip<00:02:01.500> snapped<00:02:02.189> off<00:02:02.600> it's<00:02:03.600> still<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> good<00:02:04.200> force

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
tip snapped off it's still a good force

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.530 
tip snapped off it's still a good force
multiplier<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:05.460> I<00:02:05.520> guess<00:02:05.729> theoretically<00:02:06.030> we

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
multiplier and I guess theoretically we

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.540 
multiplier and I guess theoretically we
can<00:02:06.630> still<00:02:06.899> use<00:02:07.140> it<00:02:07.170> as<00:02:07.409> the<00:02:07.680> force<00:02:07.920> motor<00:02:08.190> pile

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
can still use it as the force motor pile

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.059 
can still use it as the force motor pile
for<00:02:09.330> a<00:02:09.390> self-defense<00:02:09.929> situation<00:02:10.229> but<00:02:10.830> rather

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
for a self-defense situation but rather

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:11.880 
for a self-defense situation but rather
not<00:02:11.340> have

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
not have

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.280

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.360 

you<00:03:58.450> know<00:03:58.570> it<00:03:58.750> can<00:03:58.930> still<00:03:59.170> rip<00:03:59.709> pretty<00:04:00.130> good

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:00.370
