00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.340
 It was not 

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.030
 car 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.030
 me 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.490
 me 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:25.630
 From here on, I will tell Saito announcer about the possibility of new business 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:30.340
 I 'm Merrick I 'm Neri, but while I 'm saying Christmas 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:36.650
 Because New Year's Day is coming, everyone must hurry, but the two have nothing 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:38.300
 Where are you going ? Now I 'm going to want to go there 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:42.079
 Oh Well, such a Damn 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.300
 What if I think I'd replace it with that heavy load 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:51.100
 If you can do it all over the Internet, it will be easier for you to reach the country . 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.430
 Although those who think like that now I want you to see me The this data more 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.320
 Trading using the Internet is expanding year by year. 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:04.500
 Last year, according to the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:08.700
 The yearly total sales of department stores nationwide is written as a seal of Â¥ 9,500 billion 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:14.430
 I ca n't wait for big but it 's over, it's already just convenient on the internet 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.450
 But there are a lot of people who think that they can't talk directly because they are a little lonely 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.310
 I think that 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.490
 If you look at the report you are going to see from now on, it will change a little outside that 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:27.450
 He can not open now and listen and keep on going 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.450
 It has appeared until such store by using the possibility of making it a new 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:36.500
 It is the street corner of Tokyo Sangenjaya that there is a shop 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:37.620
 Look is a fishmonger who came out this is done To my sister's 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:42.660
 Sakama 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:46.460
 I have only a tablet device, but in the screen of this tablet 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.960
 Is there a fish shop inside? 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.070
 There is that fisker 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.210
 1 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.210
 So in the world of about 1 kilometer we do not go around 8000 so far 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:04.409
 If you come to the back of this screen, you are a male 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.610
 The woman who came to you in the foreground was the first to come today 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.660
 In living alone 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.190
 What is that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:13.300
 It is time if recommended 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.300
 I am responsible for shaping 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:22.170
 It's a salmon, but I'm jealous and delicious . 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.870
 This means that although the tip of the terminal I have a Mei Saka 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:28.390
 Besides, it is connected with a fish shop in Hokkaido Otaru 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:34.540
 Kinki probably Angler 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:37.680
 It can be ordered at the terminal of the vehicle that is lined with 100 kinds of fish caught in Hokkaido Hokkaido 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 That's what it means 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:46.690
 In other words, what do you say ? 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:51.849
 The same interaction can be through the screen as being in but it is a new direct that over-the-counter, such as 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:54.120
 I and seen the raw teeth that get to tell from the a delicious way to eat up to handling the way 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:58.200
 There is also a sense of trust 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.799
 I always use a butter knife because there is a gap here 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.890
 Or a pop Kyukkyu' place juice Once you put in here Daicha 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:12.760
 Open to this amazing easy 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:14.800
 The reason why the umbrella of the Date umbrella is so easy to hear that it's a 7 relay 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.550
 N young Kotcha 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.550
 Just eat this way 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:29.010
 It will eat Do'm Yeah hidden live Ossso of 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.690
 In addition, please pay attention to the process of the upper drawing at the beginning . 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.810
 ua 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:36.950
 Confirm your voice yes 2,000 yen 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:41.430
 yeah please lose a little 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:45.350
 It is not good and I want you to do it for 1,500 yen in the diary 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:50.150
 Mr. Saito-san who took off was misty 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:55.310
 Once again the bare You said you Hitoshi Yoshikawa this hot water fish shop's owner 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:04:02.500
 I work as a truck driver on weekdays, but I think I want to do new business on the weekend 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:02.500
 If it is this, it will start from two years ago to try to challenge because it does not cost money on food investment 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.890
 But it is not rent a store 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:12.910
 It is not restructuring because there is no stock after that 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.100
 I take it is ok So cost with it if you have a terminal in 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.100
 I can really do it from my own surroundings 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:29.839
 Mr. Yoshitaka of the end road has received 15% of sales as a commission now 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:33.979
 I see I'm items can also date specified I arrived two days later to tsunami Te 

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:38.360
 But it is also good is called the store in addition anywhere so easy this move 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:44.599
 The first two years have passed, but the popularity has spread with the word of mouth, but it is out in the photo 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:47.019
 The teaser also's a shop in the city of out from such inconvenient residential area is the Toka local spa town shopping 

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.019
 There seems to be 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:54.960
 Obviously this is the distance and time of the business being liberated from low temperatures 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.250
 Izumi to go to the place of your customer's 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.250
 It can be in other 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:14.200
 This live relay sale also plays a role in local revitalization. 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:14.200
 That relay destination was Otaru in Hokkaido The population continued to decline by 20% in 20 years 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:26.000
 It is Kawashima, who runs a fish shop in the previous of the main barrel 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:28.849
 At first, of course it was said that I only thought about what I could do with sales. 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.050
 Also it would have appeared unexpected effect now 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:37.289
 Approach the patrons in Tokyo increases in raw relay also sold its people 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:40.249
 In fact I think I me to come to travel I Do not say and want to go to Otaru 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:40.249
 I 'm going to 

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:50.340
 Get to know people who did not get to know 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:51.090
 I think that there are a lot of blood in the part that can not be measured with money that people who are not interested are interested 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:52.840
 More 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.110
 It is infinite 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:55.110
 5 minutes 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.690
 Depending on how you use it, it will spread 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:09.710
 We also heard from experts, but there is also the possibility that this live broadcast sales society will change significantly 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:13.810
 I pointed out that it is not 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:20.800
 There are people like so-called shopping refugees 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:22.030
 Actually, it is enough to change the brain with fresh vegetables and fresh Osaka while staying at home 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:27.850
 You can think 

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:31.950
 Because so-called regional disparities in so-called convenience of life go in the direction of shrinking 

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:31.950
 So that it is rich and convenient life 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:38.870
 I have a temperament image even on that Internet, but this communication 

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:43.610
 You can also 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.260
 There is also a connection with people who are very high, so it's a whistle so there is a possibility 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.800
 It seems to expand further 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:52.840
 You may be fine for Nakata, right? 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.349
 In fact also the day we visited the interview came out to now screen that sells seafood from Mie Prefecture 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:57.250
 Ne 

00:06:53.349 --> 00:07:02.670
 Women have come and I still have no local happiness 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:06.930
 I really wanted to make my trip better I really wanted to learn this system 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:10.860
 Become a little convenient when you open Neyoshi-san also two years ago of Yoshikawa's shopkeeper 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:14.480
 It seems that I was thinking only about what I should set up, but now there are new possibilities in the past two years 

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:18.640
 I feel that I'm spreading more and more 

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.640
 It was Saito announcer to here
