existences so you know I heard that very

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.890 
existences so you know I heard that very
clearly<00:01:30.280> in<00:01:30.490> James<00:01:30.850> McMillan's<00:01:31.299> music<00:01:31.689> the

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
clearly in James McMillan's music the

clearly in James McMillan's music the
first<00:01:32.170> and<00:01:32.380> third<00:01:32.530> movement<00:01:34.049> incredibly

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
first and third movement incredibly

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.149 
first and third movement incredibly
complex<00:01:36.640> and<00:01:37.119> busy<00:01:37.570> and<00:01:38.080> then<00:01:38.650> in<00:01:38.799> the<00:01:38.920> middle

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
complex and busy and then in the middle

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.210 
complex and busy and then in the middle
of<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:39.430> there's<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:41.259> kind<00:01:41.680> of<00:01:41.830> wash

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
of this there's this this kind of wash

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.890 
of this there's this this kind of wash
of<00:01:43.710> orchestral<00:01:44.710> texture<00:01:45.490> that<00:01:45.820> suggests<00:01:46.509> a

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
of orchestral texture that suggests a

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.899 
of orchestral texture that suggests a
little<00:01:47.380> bit<00:01:47.500> of<00:01:47.590> Scotland<00:01:48.040> there's<00:01:48.759> some

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
little bit of Scotland there's some

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.780 
little bit of Scotland there's some
Scottish<00:01:49.270> themes<00:01:49.600> in<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:49.960> music<00:01:50.380> which<00:01:50.979> kind

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
Scottish themes in the music which kind

00:01:51.790 --> 00:02:05.580 
Scottish themes in the music which kind
of<00:01:51.909> help<00:01:52.119> to<00:01:52.390> illustrate<00:01:52.960> that

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.930 

think<00:02:06.590> in<00:02:06.680> all<00:02:06.890> honesty<00:02:06.920> I<00:02:07.400> was<00:02:07.729> pretty

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
think in all honesty I was pretty

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.180 
think in all honesty I was pretty
terrified<00:02:08.509> of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> music<00:02:09.110> when<00:02:09.319> I<00:02:09.350> first<00:02:09.649> when

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
terrified of the music when I first when

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:11.890 
terrified of the music when I first when
i<00:02:10.220> first<00:02:10.490> started<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:11.000> work<00:02:11.180> with<00:02:11.360> it<00:02:11.510> it's

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
i first started to work with it it's

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.610 
i first started to work with it it's
very<00:02:12.200> very<00:02:12.530> hard<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.100> to<00:02:13.730> break<00:02:13.970> down<00:02:14.620> it

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
very very hard to to break down it

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.940 
very very hard to to break down it
becomes<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.340> mathematical<00:02:17.239> problem

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
becomes like a mathematical problem

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.010 
becomes like a mathematical problem
which<00:02:18.950> first<00:02:19.340> was<00:02:19.550> my<00:02:19.730> math<00:02:19.940> first<00:02:20.660> was<00:02:20.870> my

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:21.020 
which first was my math first was my

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.140 
which first was my math first was my
problem<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.590> and<00:02:21.890> then<00:02:22.310> becomes<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.880> problem

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:23.150 
problem and and then becomes the problem

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:25.240 
problem and and then becomes the problem
for<00:02:23.270> the<00:02:23.360> dancers<00:02:23.750> because<00:02:24.050> they<00:02:24.290> have<00:02:24.500> they

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
for the dancers because they have they

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.030 
for the dancers because they have they
have<00:02:25.400> to<00:02:25.550> break<00:02:25.930> every<00:02:26.930> sequence<00:02:27.410> of<00:02:27.709> the

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
have to break every sequence of the

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.880 
have to break every sequence of the
music<00:02:28.370> down<00:02:28.610> very<00:02:29.090> clearly<00:02:29.480> with<00:02:30.230> counts<00:02:30.650> and

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:30.890 
music down very clearly with counts and

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.460 
music down very clearly with counts and
it's<00:02:31.670> very<00:02:31.880> hard<00:02:32.120> to<00:02:32.180> count<00:02:32.480> and<00:02:32.780> to<00:02:33.260> dance

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
it's very hard to count and to dance

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.820 
it's very hard to count and to dance
