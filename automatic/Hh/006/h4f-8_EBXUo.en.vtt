filling this package I feel like those

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.190 
filling this package I feel like those
two<00:00:35.190> games<00:00:35.399> inside<00:00:35.850> one<00:00:36.239> feels<00:00:36.540> like<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
two games inside one feels like a

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.020 
two games inside one feels like a
console<00:00:37.800> game<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> other<00:00:38.520> one<00:00:38.850> is<00:00:39.000> a

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
console game and the other one is a

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.400 
console game and the other one is a
smaller<00:00:39.450> one<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.780> it<00:00:40.020> feels<00:00:40.170> like<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
smaller one so it feels like a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.799 
smaller one so it feels like a
playstation<00:00:41.070> vita<00:00:41.370> game<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.420> let's<00:00:42.660> go<00:00:42.780> ahead

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
going to make a quick guess before I

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.720 
going to make a quick guess before I
open<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:57.960> up<00:00:58.140> because<00:00:58.350> I'm<00:00:58.949> anxious<00:00:59.309> to<00:00:59.340> find

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
open this up because I'm anxious to find

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.139 
open this up because I'm anxious to find
out<00:00:59.879> so<00:01:00.719> it's<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.050> vita<00:01:01.289> game<00:01:01.649> in<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.190> console

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
out so it's a vita game in a console

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
out so it's a vita game in a console
game<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.290> I'm<00:01:04.409> guessing<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.040> could<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> maybe

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
game so I'm guessing this could be maybe

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.700 
game so I'm guessing this could be maybe
an<00:01:05.970> early<00:01:06.270> copy<00:01:06.510> of<00:01:06.720> Killzone<00:01:07.260> or<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
an early copy of Killzone or the

this the PlayStation Vita copy so here

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.860 
this the PlayStation Vita copy so here
is<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.950> cover<00:03:57.370> pretty<00:03:57.970> much<00:03:58.090> the<00:03:58.329> same<00:03:58.480> exact

00:03:58.860 --> 00:03:58.870 
is the cover pretty much the same exact

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:00.780

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.740 
I think it looks better in blue that's
just<00:04:03.099> my<00:04:03.250> opinion<00:04:03.280> of<00:04:03.819> course<00:04:04.299> my<00:04:04.599> favorite

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750

just my opinion of course my favorite
color<00:04:05.049> is<00:04:05.139> blue<00:04:05.560> I'm<00:04:05.910> so<00:04:06.910> I'm<00:04:07.090> going<00:04:07.329> to<00:04:07.359> take

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
color is blue I'm so I'm going to take

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.909 
color is blue I'm so I'm going to take
off<00:04:07.630> the<00:04:07.780> plastic<00:04:07.930> so<00:04:08.470> you<00:04:08.560> guys<00:04:08.650> don't<00:04:08.769> get

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.160 
so here is the front of the case and

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.610 
so here is the front of the case and
here<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.790> in<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.600> back<00:04:19.840> because<00:04:20.260> when<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 
here is in the back because when I

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:22.080 
here is in the back because when I
played<00:04:20.890> the<00:04:21.010> demo<00:04:21.190> on<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:21.520> wii<00:04:21.670> u<00:04:21.880> there's

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
played the demo on the wii u there's

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:24.060 
played the demo on the wii u there's
some<00:04:22.240> touchscreen<00:04:22.750> interface<00:04:22.930> which<00:04:23.740> is<00:04:23.890> why

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
some touchscreen interface which is why

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.140 
some touchscreen interface which is why
i<00:04:24.100> was<00:04:24.310> going<00:04:24.430> to<00:04:24.490> get<00:04:24.610> it<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:24.790> the<00:04:24.940> vita

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
i was going to get it on the vita

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.640 
i was going to get it on the vita
because<00:04:25.540> the<00:04:25.720> vita<00:04:25.930> has<00:04:26.140> the<00:04:26.320> touch<00:04:26.500> screen

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
because the vita has the touch screen

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.830 
because the vita has the touch screen
option<00:04:27.220> and<00:04:27.430> it<00:04:27.880> is<00:04:28.000> showing<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.390> right<00:04:28.720> over

option and it is showing that right over

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.190 
option and it is showing that right over
