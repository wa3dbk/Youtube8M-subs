careful<00:02:32.320> or<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:32.829> when<00:02:33.070> you've<00:02:33.160> got<00:02:33.250> it

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
careful or not when you've got it

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.819 
careful or not when you've got it
unlocked<00:02:34.140> just<00:02:35.140> give<00:02:35.290> it<00:02:35.320> a<00:02:35.530> piece<00:02:35.799> of

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:35.829 
unlocked just give it a piece of

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:40.979 
unlocked just give it a piece of
protective<00:02:36.340> foam<00:02:38.760> ok<00:02:39.760> so<00:02:39.820> as<00:02:40.570> you<00:02:40.690> can<00:02:40.750> see

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
protective foam ok so as you can see

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.789 
protective foam ok so as you can see
there<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.530> screen<00:02:42.070> protector<00:02:43.560> covers<00:02:44.560> the

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
there the screen protector covers the

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:47.610 
there the screen protector covers the
camera<00:02:45.549> hole<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:46.209> also<00:02:46.840> did<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.109> speaker<00:02:47.380> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
camera hole and also did the speaker to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.170 
camera hole and also did the speaker to
keep<00:02:47.890> them<00:02:48.040> particular<00:02:48.730> from<00:02:48.850> the<00:02:48.940> elements

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
keep them particular from the elements

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.530 
keep them particular from the elements
and<00:02:49.420> the<00:02:50.350> screen<00:02:50.650> is<00:02:50.829> the<00:02:51.760> early<00:02:51.910> flexible<00:02:52.420> so

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
and the screen is the early flexible so

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.670 
and the screen is the early flexible so
you<00:02:52.600> want<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> be<00:02:52.870> pretty<00:02:53.079> careful<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.620> that

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
you want to be pretty careful with that

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.580 
you want to be pretty careful with that
I<00:02:53.799> think<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.250> would<00:02:54.370> damage<00:02:54.489> fairly<00:02:54.970> easily

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
I think that would damage fairly easily

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.660 
I think that would damage fairly easily
if<00:02:56.590> you<00:02:56.829> didn't<00:02:57.400> look<00:02:57.459> after<00:02:57.819> it<00:02:59.069> ok<00:03:00.069> so<00:03:00.130> the

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:00.670 
if you didn't look after it ok so the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:03.479 
if you didn't look after it ok so the
next<00:03:00.700> step<00:03:00.970> will<00:03:01.269> be<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:02.069> put<00:03:03.069> the<00:03:03.160> attachment

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
next step will be to put the attachment

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.059 
next step will be to put the attachment
on<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.579> bike<00:03:03.760> Joel<00:03:04.420> I'll<00:03:04.930> do<00:03:05.200> and<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:05.650> we'll

s2<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.340> case<00:03:44.550> just<00:03:45.710> pop<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:46.890> like<00:03:47.070> that

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
s2 in this case just pop it in like that

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.050 
s2 in this case just pop it in like that
before<00:03:48.990> I<00:03:49.200> said<00:03:49.380> this<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.530> for<00:03:49.740> the<00:03:50.060> headphones

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
before I said this is for the headphones

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.480 
before I said this is for the headphones
but<00:03:51.390> it's<00:03:51.570> obviously<00:03:52.020> actually<00:03:52.320> for<00:03:52.530> the<00:03:52.560> USB

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:53.490 
but it's obviously actually for the USB

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:54.740 
but it's obviously actually for the USB
charger<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.060> cord<00:03:54.300> would<00:03:54.450> go<00:03:54.570> through

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
charger and the cord would go through

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.940 
charger and the cord would go through
the<00:03:54.870> hole<00:03:54.990> there<00:03:55.170> I've<00:03:55.260> just<00:03:55.380> put<00:03:55.560> the<00:03:55.650> plug<00:03:55.800> in

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
the hole there I've just put the plug in

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.820 
the hole there I've just put the plug in
from<00:03:56.790> the<00:03:56.880> inside<00:03:57.270> downwards<00:03:57.900> so<00:03:58.170> that<00:03:58.380> it's

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
from the inside downwards so that it's

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.590 
from the inside downwards so that it's
not<00:03:58.980> going<00:03:59.130> to<00:03:59.220> fall<00:03:59.370> out<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.730> all<00:03:59.850> there<00:04:00.090> which

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
not going to fall out it all there which

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.600 
not going to fall out it all there which
is<00:04:00.750> quite<00:04:00.959> neat<00:04:01.230> when<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.100> fit<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.370> in<00:04:02.459> that

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
is quite neat when you fit it in that

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.300 
is quite neat when you fit it in that
way<00:04:03.020> so<00:04:04.020> I'll<00:04:04.110> just<00:04:04.170> put<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.770> cover<00:04:05.010> down<00:04:05.130> here

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.630 
way so I'll just put the cover down here
and<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.810> make<00:04:06.990> sure<00:04:07.020> that<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.530> two<00:04:08.370> clips

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:12.330 
are out when that goes down turn over

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:16.360 
are out when that goes down turn over
lock<00:04:12.750> them<00:04:12.930> in<00:04:13.940> ok<00:04:14.940> so<00:04:15.000> that's<00:04:15.240> all<00:04:15.390> nice<00:04:15.900> and

camera if you if you wanted to use the
attachment<00:04:32.040> that<00:04:32.220> I've<00:04:32.310> already<00:04:32.430> put<00:04:33.150> onto

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
attachment that I've already put onto

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.460 
attachment that I've already put onto
the<00:04:33.390> back<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.540> the<00:04:33.690> cover<00:04:33.840> there<00:04:34.080> just<00:04:34.260> clipped

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
the back of the cover there just clipped

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:35.780 
the back of the cover there just clipped
in<00:04:34.590> place<00:04:34.740> with<00:04:34.950> those<00:04:35.040> three<00:04:35.280> prongs<00:04:35.669> that

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
in place with those three prongs that

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.900 
in place with those three prongs that
you<00:04:35.910> saw<00:04:36.060> before<00:04:37.460> so<00:04:38.460> yeah<00:04:38.640> that's<00:04:38.760> pretty

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:38.910 
you saw before so yeah that's pretty

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.870 
you saw before so yeah that's pretty
much<00:04:39.120> ready<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.479> go<00:04:39.570> and<00:04:40.430> all<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:41.520> do<00:04:41.640> to<00:04:41.669> put

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:41.880 
much ready to go and all you do to put

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:48.740 
much ready to go and all you do to put
it<00:04:41.970> on<00:04:42.090> is<00:04:45.229> to<00:04:46.229> the<00:04:46.320> left<00:04:47.330> clip<00:04:48.330> it<00:04:48.450> in<00:04:48.540> place

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:48.750 
it on is to the left clip it in place

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:53.840 
it on is to the left clip it in place
and<00:04:49.040> there<00:04:50.040> it<00:04:50.130> is<00:04:50.390> you<00:04:51.390> can<00:04:51.510> also<00:04:52.700> have<00:04:53.700> it

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:53.850 
and there it is you can also have it

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:55.850 
and there it is you can also have it
landscape<00:04:54.180> rather<00:04:54.660> than<00:04:54.750> portrait<00:04:55.229> it<00:04:55.680> is<00:04:55.830> a

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
landscape rather than portrait it is a

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.670 
landscape rather than portrait it is a
little<00:04:56.130> bit<00:04:56.360> bigger<00:04:57.360> than<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.630> sort<00:04:58.410> of<00:04:58.440> hoped

00:04:58.670 --> 00:04:58.680 
little bit bigger than I sort of hoped

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.110 
little bit bigger than I sort of hoped
but<00:04:58.979> it's<00:04:59.250> still<00:04:59.400> pretty<00:04:59.610> reasonable<00:05:00.030> when

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
but it's still pretty reasonable when

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.390 
but it's still pretty reasonable when
it's<00:05:00.320> getting<00:05:01.320> quite<00:05:01.650> a<00:05:01.680> nice<00:05:01.890> big<00:05:02.130> clear

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
it's getting quite a nice big clear

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.590 
it's getting quite a nice big clear
screen<00:05:02.700> when<00:05:02.910> you're<00:05:03.030> riding<00:05:03.150> along<00:05:03.300> you've

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
screen when you're riding along you've

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.530 
screen when you're riding along you've
ever<00:05:03.750> seen<00:05:03.930> apps<00:05:04.200> and<00:05:04.850> so<00:05:05.850> I'll<00:05:05.970> just<00:05:06.000> turn<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:06.540 
ever seen apps and so I'll just turn the

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.090 
ever seen apps and so I'll just turn the
fine<00:05:06.750> on<00:05:06.930> here<00:05:07.200> so<00:05:07.560> it<00:05:07.620> helps<00:05:07.890> the<00:05:07.950> all<00:05:08.040> the

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.100 
fine on here so it helps the all the

fine on here so it helps the all the
buttons<00:05:08.370> work<00:05:10.430> ok<00:05:11.430> so<00:05:11.490> the<00:05:13.430> coin<00:05:14.430> button<00:05:14.729> up

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
buttons work ok so the coin button up

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.719 
buttons work ok so the coin button up
and<00:05:15.390> down<00:05:15.720> that<00:05:16.080> works<00:05:16.320> fine<00:05:16.590> quite<00:05:17.520> a<00:05:17.550> nice

00:05:17.719 --> 00:05:17.729 
and down that works fine quite a nice

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.900 
and down that works fine quite a nice
feel<00:05:17.970> to<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.240> buttons<00:05:18.510> there<00:05:18.690> as<00:05:18.810> well<00:05:19.910> I've

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:39.390 
on long distances use something like

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:42.410 
on long distances use something like
I've<00:05:40.080> got<00:05:40.350> RX<00:05:40.680> maps<00:05:40.920> which<00:05:41.340> i<00:05:41.520> use<00:05:41.670> the<00:05:41.910> the

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
I've got RX maps which i use the the

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:44.840 
I've got RX maps which i use the the
bike<00:05:42.630> maps<00:05:42.870> or<00:05:43.080> even<00:05:43.410> just<00:05:43.490> google<00:05:44.490> maps<00:05:44.640> if

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
bike maps or even just google maps if

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.910 
bike maps or even just google maps if
you<00:05:45.060> a<00:05:45.450> bit<00:05:46.230> of<00:05:46.260> an<00:05:46.320> idea<00:05:46.470> where<00:05:46.770> you're<00:05:46.890> going

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:46.920 
you a bit of an idea where you're going

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:48.920 
you a bit of an idea where you're going
and<00:05:47.280> just<00:05:47.370> wanted<00:05:47.670> a<00:05:47.760> general<00:05:48.090> street<00:05:48.330> map<00:05:48.510> and

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:48.930 
and just wanted a general street map and

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.870 
and just wanted a general street map and
obviously<00:05:49.650> you<00:05:49.740> can<00:05:49.860> turn<00:05:49.980> that<00:05:50.160> landscape<00:05:50.700> as

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:50.880 
obviously you can turn that landscape as

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.730 
obviously you can turn that landscape as
well<00:05:51.060> if<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.540> want<00:05:51.570> and<00:05:51.840> that's<00:05:51.960> quite<00:05:52.440> handy

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
well if you want and that's quite handy

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.730 
well if you want and that's quite handy
so<00:05:52.890> you<00:05:52.980> can<00:05:53.070> use<00:05:53.190> all<00:05:53.340> the<00:05:53.370> features<00:05:53.550> on<00:05:53.880> that

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:54.740 
so you can use all the features on that

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.890 
so you can use all the features on that
so<00:05:55.740> overall<00:05:56.190> I<00:05:56.460> think<00:05:56.820> it's<00:05:57.240> pretty<00:05:57.450> handy<00:05:57.810> if

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
so overall I think it's pretty handy if

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.120 
so overall I think it's pretty handy if
you<00:05:57.990> don't<00:05:58.170> mind<00:05:58.290> it<00:05:58.440> being<00:05:58.620> a<00:05:58.740> little<00:05:58.950> bit

00:05:59.120 --> 00:05:59.130 
you don't mind it being a little bit

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.460 
you don't mind it being a little bit
chunky<00:06:00.120> but<00:06:00.390> for<00:06:01.290> little<00:06:01.770> over<00:06:01.920> 20<00:06:02.580> pounds<00:06:02.940> off

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470 
chunky but for little over 20 pounds off

chunky but for little over 20 pounds off
ordering<00:06:04.470> over<00:06:04.680> the<00:06:04.740> internet<00:06:05.040> I<00:06:05.190> think

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:05.720

guess<00:06:35.250> cover<00:06:35.640> this<00:06:35.730> over<00:06:36.030> and<00:06:36.090> not<00:06:36.210> use<00:06:36.330> it<00:06:36.480> for

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:36.660 
guess cover this over and not use it for

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:39.080 
guess cover this over and not use it for
a<00:06:36.690> while<00:06:36.900> otherwise<00:06:37.800> it<00:06:38.100> clicks<00:06:38.370> in<00:06:38.550> and<00:06:38.820> stays

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:39.090 
a while otherwise it clicks in and stays

00:06:39.090 --> 00:06:40.190 
a while otherwise it clicks in and stays
in<00:06:39.240> here<00:06:39.360> pretty<00:06:39.600> well<00:06:39.660> with<00:06:39.900> these<00:06:40.020> little

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:40.200 
in here pretty well with these little

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:42.680 
in here pretty well with these little
grooves<00:06:40.530> in<00:06:40.950> here<00:06:41.310> pretty<00:06:42.150> difficult<00:06:42.360> to<00:06:42.600> get

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:42.690 
grooves in here pretty difficult to get

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:43.820 
grooves in here pretty difficult to get
out<00:06:42.810> so<00:06:42.990> you<00:06:43.080> just<00:06:43.230> use<00:06:43.410> the<00:06:43.530> quick<00:06:43.680> release

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
out so you just use the quick release

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:45.950 
out so you just use the quick release
it's<00:06:44.760> actually<00:06:44.880> just<00:06:45.270> indicates<00:06:45.720> that<00:06:45.810> when

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
it's actually just indicates that when

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.870 
it's actually just indicates that when
you<00:06:46.020> push<00:06:46.200> the<00:06:46.320> bottom<00:06:46.530> here<00:06:46.740> that's<00:06:47.460> the<00:06:47.670> side

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:47.880 
you push the bottom here that's the side

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.280 
you push the bottom here that's the side
that<00:06:47.910> comes<00:06:48.330> out<00:06:48.510> so<00:06:48.600> you<00:06:48.690> pull<00:06:48.870> it<00:06:48.990> out<00:06:49.050> from

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:49.290 
that comes out so you pull it out from

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:53.300 
that comes out so you pull it out from
the<00:06:50.280> right<00:06:50.610> to<00:06:51.120> the<00:06:51.150> left<00:06:51.270> so<00:06:52.080> just<00:06:53.010> say<00:06:53.130> that
