machine this is this video segment is

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.480 
machine this is this video segment is
about<00:00:19.429> how<00:00:20.210> to<00:00:20.269> do<00:00:20.869> the<00:00:21.109> upper<00:00:21.500> threading<00:00:21.919> and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
about how to do the upper threading and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.029 
about how to do the upper threading and
we'll<00:00:23.449> do<00:00:23.720> a<00:00:23.750> little<00:00:23.929> sewing<00:00:24.199> demonstration

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
we'll do a little sewing demonstration

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.640 
we'll do a little sewing demonstration
with<00:00:25.220> it<00:00:25.369> here<00:00:25.669> in<00:00:25.820> a<00:00:25.880> moment

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
with it here in a moment

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.120 
with it here in a moment
this<00:00:27.650> threading<00:00:28.160> of<00:00:28.369> this<00:00:28.490> machine<00:00:28.970> is<00:00:30.130> not

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:31.130 
this threading of this machine is not

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.430 
this threading of this machine is not
exactly<00:00:31.759> straightforward<00:00:32.150> like<00:00:32.720> many<00:00:33.290> of

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
exactly straightforward like many of

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.490 
exactly straightforward like many of
these<00:00:33.560> machines<00:00:33.829> from<00:00:34.370> this<00:00:34.520> era<00:00:34.820> are<00:00:35.390> or<00:00:36.260> are

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
these machines from this era are or are

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.340 
these machines from this era are or are
not<00:00:36.530> this<00:00:37.010> case<00:00:37.520> maybe<00:00:37.930> if<00:00:39.730> the<00:00:40.730> manual<00:00:41.210> is<00:00:41.690> not

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:42.350 
not this case maybe if the manual is not

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.760 
not this case maybe if the manual is not
terribly<00:00:42.980> clear<00:00:43.840> so<00:00:44.840> I<00:00:44.870> will<00:00:45.260> show<00:00:45.440> you<00:00:45.500> what<00:00:45.739> I

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
terribly clear so I will show you what I

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.180 
terribly clear so I will show you what I
have<00:00:46.039> done<00:00:46.370> and<00:00:47.350> at<00:00:48.350> this<00:00:48.530> point<00:00:48.859> in<00:00:48.949> time<00:00:49.129> I

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:49.190 
have done and at this point in time I

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.540 
have done and at this point in time I
cannot<00:00:49.730> say<00:00:49.969> this<00:00:50.210> is<00:00:50.390> totally<00:00:50.960> gospel<00:00:51.550> but

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
cannot say this is totally gospel but

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.099 
cannot say this is totally gospel but
you<00:00:53.420> have<00:00:54.109> the<00:00:54.260> usual<00:00:55.120> spool<00:00:56.120> thread<00:00:56.480> and<00:00:56.929> it

00:00:57.099 --> 00:00:57.109 
you have the usual spool thread and it

00:00:57.109 --> 00:01:00.220 
you have the usual spool thread and it
comes<00:00:57.350> forward<00:00:57.739> and<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:59.059> is<00:00:59.120> where<00:00:59.510> if<00:00:59.899> I<00:01:00.050> can

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
comes forward and this is where if I can

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.829 
comes forward and this is where if I can
zoom<00:01:00.530> in<00:01:00.739> on<00:01:00.949> this<00:01:01.309> it<00:01:02.179> becomes<00:01:02.480> a<00:01:02.660> little

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
zoom in on this it becomes a little

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.820 
zoom in on this it becomes a little
questionable<00:01:04.360> there<00:01:05.360> is<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:06.170> hook<00:01:06.560> right

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
questionable there is that hook right

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:12.940 
questionable there is that hook right
there<00:01:07.660> there<00:01:08.660> is<00:01:08.990> there<00:01:09.800> are<00:01:09.860> three<00:01:11.950> little

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
there there is there are three little

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.610 
there there is there are three little
prongs<00:01:13.280> on<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.850> thing<00:01:14.090> and<00:01:14.420> the<00:01:15.140> best<00:01:15.380> that<00:01:15.560> I

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:15.620 
prongs on the thing and the best that I

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.330 
prongs on the thing and the best that I
can<00:01:16.010> figure<00:01:16.280> out<00:01:16.900> from<00:01:17.900> what<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.890> manual<00:01:19.190> says

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
can figure out from what the manual says

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.810 
can figure out from what the manual says
you<00:01:20.200> just<00:01:21.200> run<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.590> thing<00:01:21.920> underneath<00:01:22.310> there

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
you just run the thing underneath there

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.360 
you just run the thing underneath there
I'm<00:01:23.060> the<00:01:24.050> manual<00:01:24.530> makes<00:01:24.740> it<00:01:24.920> sound<00:01:25.100> more

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
I'm the manual makes it sound more

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.850 
I'm the manual makes it sound more
complicated<00:01:25.640> than<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.050> either<00:01:27.470> it's

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
complicated than it is so either it's

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.540 
complicated than it is so either it's
screwed<00:01:28.250> up<00:01:28.490> or<00:01:28.700> I'm<00:01:28.850> misinterpreting<00:01:29.330> things

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
screwed up or I'm misinterpreting things

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:35.410 
screwed up or I'm misinterpreting things
and<00:01:31.550> it<00:01:31.700> goes<00:01:31.880> down<00:01:33.520> I'll<00:01:34.520> make<00:01:34.760> sure<00:01:35.030> that<00:01:35.270> the

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
and it goes down I'll make sure that the

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.940 
and it goes down I'll make sure that the
presser<00:01:35.630> foot<00:01:35.780> is<00:01:36.110> up<00:01:36.140> while<00:01:36.470> you're<00:01:36.650> doing

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
presser foot is up while you're doing

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.250 
presser foot is up while you're doing
this<00:01:37.180> let's<00:01:38.180> see<00:01:38.420> if<00:01:38.480> we<00:01:38.600> can<00:01:38.780> zoom<00:01:38.990> in<00:01:39.200> a

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
this let's see if we can zoom in a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.580 
this let's see if we can zoom in a
little<00:01:39.380> tighter<00:01:39.860> here<00:01:40.900> it's<00:01:41.900> fairly<00:01:42.140> easy<00:01:42.290> to

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
little tighter here it's fairly easy to

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:50.160 
little tighter here it's fairly easy to
do<00:01:42.860> this<00:01:43.210> you<00:01:44.590> let<00:01:45.590> me<00:01:45.710> get<00:01:45.920> a<00:01:45.950> pointer<00:01:46.640> here

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.780 

okay<00:01:52.780> you<00:01:53.780> hook<00:01:54.020> it<00:01:54.200> right<00:01:54.230> underneath<00:01:54.950> this

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
okay you hook it right underneath this

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.710 
okay you hook it right underneath this
dude<00:01:56.120> on<00:01:56.330> right<00:01:56.630> here<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.890> then<00:01:58.880> that<00:01:59.210> then

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
dude on right here and then that then

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.330 
dude on right here and then that then
you<00:01:59.900> wrap<00:02:00.140> it<00:02:00.170> around<00:02:00.380> and<00:02:00.890> pull<00:02:01.070> it<00:02:01.190> up

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
you wrap it around and pull it up

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.300 
you wrap it around and pull it up
alongside<00:02:02.060> here<00:02:02.780> and<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.470> check<00:02:03.740> spring<00:02:04.100> is

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
alongside here and the check spring is

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.070 
alongside here and the check spring is
built<00:02:04.580> into<00:02:04.790> that<00:02:05.030> and<00:02:05.330> it<00:02:05.420> will<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:05.810> catch

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.080 
built into that and it will just catch

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.070 
built into that and it will just catch
the<00:02:06.320> check<00:02:06.530> spring<00:02:06.890> on<00:02:07.100> its<00:02:07.220> way<00:02:07.400> up<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.840> then

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
the check spring on its way up and then

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.770 
the check spring on its way up and then
it<00:02:09.489> pretty<00:02:10.489> much<00:02:10.670> simply<00:02:11.120> a<00:02:11.150> matter<00:02:11.390> of<00:02:11.569> going

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
it pretty much simply a matter of going

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.500 
it pretty much simply a matter of going
up<00:02:12.079> to<00:02:12.319> the<00:02:12.560> take-up<00:02:13.159> strong<00:02:14.000> Direction

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
up to the take-up strong Direction

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.580 
up to the take-up strong Direction
take-up<00:02:14.780> lever<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:16.430> then<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.450> down<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.230> the

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
take-up lever and then back down and the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.399 
take-up lever and then back down and the
usual<00:02:19.900> thing<00:02:20.900> with<00:02:21.200> getting<00:02:22.159> it<00:02:22.370> through<00:02:22.609> the

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
usual thing with getting it through the

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.599 
usual thing with getting it through the
guide<00:02:24.409> above<00:02:24.739> the<00:02:24.859> needle<00:02:25.189> and<00:02:25.310> through<00:02:25.519> the

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:25.609 
guide above the needle and through the

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.490 
guide above the needle and through the
kneel<00:02:25.819> and<00:02:26.150> etc<00:02:26.870> etc<00:02:26.930> and<00:02:27.500> get<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.769> ready<00:02:27.890> to<00:02:28.010> go

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
kneel and etc etc and get it ready to go

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.530 
kneel and etc etc and get it ready to go
so<00:02:30.500> now<00:02:30.530> we're<00:02:31.189> going<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.519> try<00:02:32.000> sewing<00:02:32.299> with

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:32.540 
so now we're going to try sewing with

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.500 
so now we're going to try sewing with
this<00:02:32.689> thing<00:02:32.900> for<00:02:33.079> the<00:02:33.140> very<00:02:33.319> first<00:02:33.590> time<00:02:33.829> and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
this thing for the very first time and

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:43.089 
stand by okay let's see what happens
this<00:02:41.569> is<00:02:41.629> the<00:02:41.810> very<00:02:42.200> first<00:02:42.530> time<00:02:42.709> I've

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
this is the very first time I've

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:46.449 
this is the very first time I've
attempted<00:02:43.400> to<00:02:43.579> sew<00:02:43.879> with<00:02:44.060> this<00:02:44.239> thing<00:02:44.510> and<00:02:45.459> if

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:46.459 
attempted to sew with this thing and if

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.330 
attempted to sew with this thing and if
you're<00:02:46.849> actually<00:02:47.329> watching<00:02:47.810> this<00:02:48.129> it<00:02:49.129> will

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
you're actually watching this it will

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.610 
you're actually watching this it will
have<00:02:49.489> been<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.700> success<00:02:50.170> because<00:02:51.170> if<00:02:51.439> you're

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
have been a success because if you're

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.860 
have been a success because if you're
not<00:02:51.650> watching<00:02:52.069> this<00:02:52.489> I<00:02:52.700> will<00:02:53.090> have<00:02:53.180> fixed

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870 
not watching this I will have fixed

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.849 
not watching this I will have fixed
whatever<00:02:54.349> and<00:02:54.680> tried<00:02:55.040> it<00:02:55.219> again<00:02:56.290> so<00:02:57.290> I<00:02:57.319> am

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:57.859 
whatever and tried it again so I am

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
and the bottom thread has been brought

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.759 
and the bottom thread has been brought
up<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:09.549> my<00:03:10.549> hand<00:03:10.879> out<00:03:11.150> of<00:03:11.359> the<00:03:11.530> picture<00:03:12.530> here

and we lower that away see what happens
here<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:24.409> oh<00:03:24.769> by<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.099> way<00:03:25.249> as<00:03:26.090> I've<00:03:26.239> noted

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
here and oh by the way as I've noted

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.509 
here and oh by the way as I've noted
before<00:03:26.719> this<00:03:27.290> machine<00:03:27.680> sounds<00:03:28.099> a<00:03:28.159> little<00:03:28.400> bit

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
before this machine sounds a little bit

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.330 
before this machine sounds a little bit
on<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> growly<00:03:29.120> side<00:03:29.599> because<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.379> the<00:03:30.469> very

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
on the growly side because of the very

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.899 
on the growly side because of the very
old<00:03:31.639> and<00:03:31.939> hard<00:03:32.209> motor<00:03:32.870> drive<00:03:33.230> wheel<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:34.340> a<00:03:34.370> new

old and hard motor drive wheel and a new
one<00:03:35.120> is<00:03:35.389> on<00:03:35.659> order<00:03:36.439> and<00:03:36.620> will<00:03:37.010> quiet<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.549> down

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:37.579 
one is on order and will quiet it down

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.780 
one is on order and will quiet it down
considerably<00:03:38.209> but<00:03:38.779> with<00:03:39.439> that<00:03:39.620> said<00:03:39.950> we've

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
considerably but with that said we've

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.330 
considerably but with that said we've
got<00:03:40.999> the<00:03:41.180> machine<00:03:41.450> going<00:03:41.749> forward<00:03:42.340> let's

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
got the machine going forward let's

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.250 
got the machine going forward let's
crank<00:03:43.939> it<00:03:44.090> over

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:55.400 

 stitching<00:03:52.800> stand<00:03:53.220> by<00:03:54.110> let's<00:03:55.110> take<00:03:55.380> a

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
 stitching stand by let's take a

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:59.990 
 stitching stand by let's take a
look<00:03:55.709> here<00:03:56.270> yes<00:03:57.270> it<00:03:57.569> is<00:03:57.780> stitching<00:03:58.730> one<00:03:59.730> thing

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
look here yes it is stitching one thing

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.220 
look here yes it is stitching one thing
that<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.300> manual<00:04:00.630> does<00:04:00.840> not<00:04:00.989> make

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
that the manual does not make

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.650 
that the manual does not make
particularly<00:04:01.980> clear<00:04:02.340> is<00:04:02.910> how<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> place<00:04:03.630> the

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
particularly clear is how to place the

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:06.710 
particularly clear is how to place the
wound<00:04:04.650> bobbin<00:04:05.280> in<00:04:05.489> the<00:04:05.819> shuttle<00:04:06.270> and<00:04:06.450> thread

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
wound bobbin in the shuttle and thread

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:10.250 
wound bobbin in the shuttle and thread
the<00:04:06.900> shell<00:04:07.140> they<00:04:08.690> actually<00:04:09.690> do<00:04:09.810> not<00:04:09.959> have<00:04:10.019> a

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
the shell they actually do not have a

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.130 
the shell they actually do not have a
picture<00:04:10.769> of<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.250> and<00:04:11.459> they<00:04:12.090> instead<00:04:12.750> tell

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
picture of that and they instead tell

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.069 
picture of that and they instead tell
you<00:04:13.319> that<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.650> machine<00:04:14.010> came<00:04:14.400> with<00:04:15.390> the<00:04:15.660> shell

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
you that the machine came with the shell

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:19.099 
you that the machine came with the shell
already<00:04:16.970> threaded<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.269> take<00:04:18.480> a<00:04:18.510> look<00:04:18.810> at<00:04:18.959> that

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
already threaded to take a look at that

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.259 
already threaded to take a look at that
and<00:04:19.350> make<00:04:19.889> sure<00:04:20.130> you<00:04:20.250> do<00:04:20.430> it<00:04:20.579> that<00:04:20.760> way<00:04:20.820> that's

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
and make sure you do it that way that's

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.930 
and make sure you do it that way that's
really<00:04:21.630> great<00:04:22.230> 60<00:04:22.860> years<00:04:23.100> in<00:04:23.280> the<00:04:23.340> future<00:04:23.490> when

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
really great 60 years in the future when

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.810 
really great 60 years in the future when
we<00:04:24.120> don't<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.510> an<00:04:24.630> example<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:26.190> anyway<00:04:26.580> I

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
we don't have an example but anyway I

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:30.409 
we don't have an example but anyway I
placed<00:04:27.419> the<00:04:28.280> wild<00:04:29.280> bobbin<00:04:29.639> into<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:30.000> shuttle

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419 
placed the wild bobbin into the shuttle

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:34.810 
placed the wild bobbin into the shuttle
the<00:04:31.190> manual<00:04:32.190> does<00:04:32.400> not<00:04:32.580> state<00:04:33.180> which<00:04:34.139> ways<00:04:34.500> the

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
the manual does not state which ways the

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.000 
the manual does not state which ways the
thread<00:04:35.820> should<00:04:36.000> come<00:04:36.240> off<00:04:36.510> the<00:04:36.750> top<00:04:36.960> to<00:04:37.889> the

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
thread should come off the top to the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.430 
thread should come off the top to the
right<00:04:38.190> or<00:04:38.340> to<00:04:38.370> the<00:04:38.490> left<00:04:38.580> so<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.090> put<00:04:39.900> it<00:04:40.020> to<00:04:40.290> the

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440 
right or to the left so I put it to the

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:43.190 
right or to the left so I put it to the
left<00:04:40.710> so<00:04:41.010> it's<00:04:41.220> a<00:04:41.460> counterclockwise<00:04:42.200> rotation

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
left so it's a counterclockwise rotation

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.530 
left so it's a counterclockwise rotation
and<00:04:44.010> the<00:04:44.930> thread<00:04:45.930> comes<00:04:46.290> through<00:04:46.620> this<00:04:46.860> little

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
and the thread comes through this little

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.010 
and the thread comes through this little
slot<00:04:48.540> right<00:04:48.750> here<00:04:50.210> and<00:04:51.210> you<00:04:51.300> pull<00:04:51.540> it<00:04:51.570> up<00:04:51.810> in

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
slot right here and you pull it up in

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.870 
slot right here and you pull it up in
there<00:04:52.290> and<00:04:52.560> then<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.860> take<00:04:53.100> it<00:04:53.130> across<00:04:53.550> to<00:04:53.820> the

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
there and then you take it across to the

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.150 
there and then you take it across to the
other<00:04:53.970> side<00:04:54.540> of<00:04:55.050> this<00:04:55.200> doo<00:04:55.500> dah<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.950> you'll

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.160 
other side of this doo dah and you'll

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:57.770 
other side of this doo dah and you'll
find<00:04:56.490> a<00:04:56.580> little<00:04:56.789> slot<00:04:57.060> over<00:04:57.330> there<00:04:57.570> and<00:04:57.720> you

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
find a little slot over there and you

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.230 
find a little slot over there and you
just<00:04:57.930> sort<00:04:58.140> of<00:04:58.229> pull<00:04:58.410> it<00:04:58.560> in<00:04:58.740> and<00:04:59.010> and<00:04:59.460> pull<00:05:00.090> it

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
just sort of pull it in and and pull it

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.029 
just sort of pull it in and and pull it
up<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.570> it<00:05:00.630> comes<00:05:00.660> exits<00:05:01.320> right<00:05:01.470> off<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.800> top

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
up and it comes exits right off the top

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.630 
up and it comes exits right off the top
it's<00:05:03.000> pretty<00:05:03.419> straightforward<00:05:04.520> once<00:05:05.520> you

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:05.640 
it's pretty straightforward once you

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:08.690 
it's pretty straightforward once you
figure<00:05:05.970> it<00:05:06.000> out<00:05:06.180> and<00:05:07.010> the<00:05:08.010> other<00:05:08.190> thing<00:05:08.520> I

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:08.700 
figure it out and the other thing I

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.890 
figure it out and the other thing I
wanted<00:05:09.060> to<00:05:09.120> make<00:05:09.390> note<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:10.760> was<00:05:11.760> because<00:05:12.390> the

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
wanted to make note of was because the

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:16.130 
wanted to make note of was because the
manual<00:05:13.289> doesn't<00:05:13.500> state<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:14.130> either<00:05:14.419> is<00:05:15.419> if

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:16.140 
manual doesn't state this either is if

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:20.180 
manual doesn't state this either is if
you<00:05:16.289> take<00:05:16.530> a<00:05:16.770> look<00:05:17.190> at<00:05:18.289> the<00:05:19.289> bobbin<00:05:19.710> winder

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:20.190 
you take a look at the bobbin winder

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:26.080 
you take a look at the bobbin winder
tire<00:05:20.550> right<00:05:21.060> there<00:05:22.220> that<00:05:23.220> actually<00:05:24.210> is<00:05:24.830> a

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
tire right there that actually is a

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.870 
tire right there that actually is a
standard<00:05:27.090> Singer<00:05:27.990> bobbin<00:05:28.410> winder<00:05:28.860> tire<00:05:29.130> part

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
standard Singer bobbin winder tire part

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:33.740 
standard Singer bobbin winder tire part
number<00:05:30.450> 15<00:05:31.380> to<00:05:31.850> 87<00:05:32.850> you<00:05:33.000> can<00:05:33.210> find<00:05:33.479> them

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:33.750 
number 15 to 87 you can find them

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:34.820 
number 15 to 87 you can find them
anywhere

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:34.830 
anywhere

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.310 
anywhere
which<00:05:35.280> is<00:05:35.460> really<00:05:35.669> nice<00:05:36.000> and<00:05:36.419> this<00:05:37.110> machine

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
which is really nice and this machine

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.180 
which is really nice and this machine
also<00:05:37.770> uses<00:05:38.460> standard<00:05:38.700> 15<00:05:39.419> x1<00:05:39.960> needles<00:05:40.410> which

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:41.190 
also uses standard 15 x1 needles which

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:43.520 
also uses standard 15 x1 needles which
you<00:05:41.340> can<00:05:41.520> get<00:05:41.760> anywhere<00:05:42.240> that<00:05:42.630> also<00:05:42.930> is<00:05:43.500> very

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
nice and this is the shuttle placed into

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.730 
nice and this is the shuttle placed into
the<00:05:49.740> hook<00:05:50.070> and<00:05:50.280> race<00:05:50.490> assembly<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:52.710> will

00:05:59.750 --> 00:05:59.760 
the bottom about the 5:30 position that

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:01.680 
the bottom about the 5:30 position that
much<00:06:00.030> must<00:06:00.419> be<00:06:00.510> lifted<00:06:01.110> up<00:06:01.229> with

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:01.690 
much must be lifted up with

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.260 
much must be lifted up with
and<00:06:01.960> while<00:06:02.290> the<00:06:02.560> shuttle<00:06:03.340> assembly<00:06:03.850> is<00:06:04.000> placed

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
and while the shuttle assembly is placed

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.320 
and while the shuttle assembly is placed
in<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.750> race<00:06:04.960> with<00:06:05.200> the<00:06:05.350> other<00:06:05.530> which<00:06:06.520> for<00:06:07.210> my

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:07.330 
in the race with the other which for my

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.240 
in the race with the other which for my
first<00:06:07.630> attempt<00:06:08.080> at<00:06:08.200> that<00:06:08.230> was<00:06:08.620> a<00:06:08.650> little<00:06:09.040> bit

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
first attempt at that was a little bit

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:11.340 
first attempt at that was a little bit
of<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.430> fumble<00:06:09.670> but<00:06:10.480> I'm<00:06:10.600> sure<00:06:10.810> it<00:06:10.960> gets<00:06:11.050> better

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.350 
of a fumble but I'm sure it gets better

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.460 
of a fumble but I'm sure it gets better
once<00:06:11.620> you<00:06:11.740> get<00:06:11.890> used<00:06:12.100> to<00:06:12.310> it
