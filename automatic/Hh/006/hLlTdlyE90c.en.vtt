00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
think I might have cut off some at the

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
think I might have cut off some at the
end<00:00:47.760> but<00:00:48.750> anyways<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.469> tell<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> it's<00:00:49.829> a

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
end but anyways just to tell you it's a

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.380 
end but anyways just to tell you it's a
90<00:00:50.219> kill<00:00:50.399> streak<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.730> started<00:00:51.030> out<00:00:51.120> late

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
90 kill streak I started out late

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.260 
90 kill streak I started out late
because<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:52.289> would<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.440> I<00:00:52.800> think<00:00:53.129> 10<00:00:53.850> minutes

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
because it would be I think 10 minutes

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.310 
because it would be I think 10 minutes
oh<00:00:54.420> I<00:00:54.989> can't<00:00:55.680> count<00:00:55.920> into<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.520> 10<00:00:56.760> minutes

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
oh I can't count into it for 10 minutes

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.939 
oh I can't count into it for 10 minutes
but<00:00:58.320> anyways<00:00:58.649> it's<00:00:59.219> definitely<00:01:00.590> probably<00:01:01.590> his

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
but anyways it's definitely probably his

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.860 
but anyways it's definitely probably his
best<00:01:02.190> gameplay<00:01:02.520> I<00:01:02.760> mean<00:01:03.030> double<00:01:03.510> new<00:01:03.629> killer

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.120 
one on YouTube there has a bit of second
one<00:02:24.849> yet<00:02:25.060> there's<00:02:25.959> been<00:02:26.109> a<00:02:26.170> fail<00:02:26.470> I<00:02:26.799> didn't

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
one yet there's been a fail I didn't

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.190 
one yet there's been a fail I didn't
look<00:02:27.220> at<00:02:27.430> it<00:02:27.459> but<00:02:27.790> saying<00:02:28.359> triple<00:02:28.840> nuclear

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
look at it but saying triple nuclear

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.379 
look at it but saying triple nuclear
fail<00:02:29.410> we're<00:02:30.340> hoping<00:02:30.639> to<00:02:30.700> be<00:02:30.880> the<00:02:30.970> second<00:02:31.299> one

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:31.389 
fail we're hoping to be the second one

00:02:31.389 --> 00:02:35.640 
fail we're hoping to be the second one
to<00:02:31.510> achieve<00:02:31.750> that<00:02:32.730> if<00:02:33.730> we<00:02:33.970> are<00:02:34.120> oh<00:02:34.389> how<00:02:35.109> excited

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
to achieve that if we are oh how excited

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.830 
to achieve that if we are oh how excited
it'd<00:02:35.739> fit<00:02:35.889> though<00:02:36.180> it<00:02:37.180> probably<00:02:37.299> won't<00:02:37.630> be<00:02:37.660> me

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
it'd fit though it probably won't be me

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.199 
it'd fit though it probably won't be me
so<00:02:38.049> don't<00:02:38.230> expect<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.709> from<00:02:38.769> me<00:02:39.069> this<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.970> I

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
so don't expect this from me this I I

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:46.080 
so don't expect this from me this I I
just<00:02:40.540> can't<00:02:40.690> do<00:02:40.870> this<00:02:41.019> I<00:02:42.660> i<00:02:44.790> guess<00:02:45.790> i<00:02:45.910> should

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
just can't do this I i guess i should

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.780 
just can't do this I i guess i should
use<00:02:46.239> this<00:02:46.389> gun<00:02:46.569> from<00:02:46.750> now<00:02:46.900> on<00:02:47.340> funny<00:02:48.340> as<00:02:48.519> it<00:02:48.639> is

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
use this gun from now on funny as it is

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.539 
use this gun from now on funny as it is
picks<00:02:49.450> up<00:02:49.569> another<00:02:49.660> a<00:02:49.870> n<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:51.220> girl<00:02:51.430> with

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
picks up another a n that girl with

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:53.160 
picks up another a n that girl with
suppressor<00:02:52.060> i<00:02:52.090> think<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.599> much<00:02:52.810> better<00:02:53.079> than

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
suppressor i think is much better than

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.390 
suppressor i think is much better than
it<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.590> without<00:02:54.069> it<00:02:55.049> because<00:02:56.049> uh<00:02:56.079> it<00:02:56.590> just

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
it is without it because uh it just

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.720 
it is without it because uh it just
seems<00:02:57.760> better<00:02:57.970> I<00:02:58.389> have<00:02:58.900> no<00:02:59.049> reason<00:02:59.349> why<00:02:59.700> one<00:03:00.700> of

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
seems better I have no reason why one of

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:02.400 
seems better I have no reason why one of
the<00:03:00.790> few<00:03:00.970> guns<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.480> put<00:03:01.599> a<00:03:01.630> suppressor<00:03:02.109> on<00:03:02.139> it

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:02.410 
the few guns and put a suppressor on it

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.819 
the few guns and put a suppressor on it
still<00:03:02.590> doesn't<00:03:03.239> it's<00:03:04.239> not<00:03:04.329> affected<00:03:04.829> all

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
still doesn't it's not affected all

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:07.220 
still doesn't it's not affected all
right

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
right

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.929 
right
so<00:03:08.230> well<00:03:08.409> that's<00:03:08.709> most<00:03:09.129> of<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:09.340> i<00:03:09.609> have<00:03:09.819> to

00:03:09.929 --> 00:03:09.939
