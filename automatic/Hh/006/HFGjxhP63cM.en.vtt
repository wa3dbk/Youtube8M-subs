sweaty clothes you do not urinate before
you<00:00:28.470> way<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.890> then<00:00:29.010> your<00:00:29.160> way<00:00:29.340> again<00:00:29.689> make<00:00:30.689> it

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:31.160 
you way and then your way again make it

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
you way and then your way again make it
and<00:00:32.160> then<00:00:32.369> you<00:00:32.489> subtract<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.030> difference<00:00:33.600> and

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
and then you subtract the difference and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.890 
and then you subtract the difference and
that's<00:00:33.960> your<00:00:34.350> sweat<00:00:34.800> rate<00:00:35.040> now<00:00:35.850> how<00:00:36.150> much<00:00:36.420> you

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:36.900 
that's your sweat rate now how much you

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.950 
that's your sweat rate now how much you
drank<00:00:37.500> during<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.760> run<00:00:38.940> you<00:00:39.150> subtract<00:00:39.690> that

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
drank during the run you subtract that

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.490 
drank during the run you subtract that
amount<00:00:40.199> and<00:00:40.820> you<00:00:41.820> have<00:00:42.090> an<00:00:42.239> indication<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.200> how

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
amount and you have an indication of how

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.119 
amount and you have an indication of how
much<00:00:43.820> your<00:00:44.820> sweat<00:00:45.210> now<00:00:46.050> everyone<00:00:46.620> loses

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
much your sweat now everyone loses

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.170 
much your sweat now everyone loses
weight<00:00:47.579> or<00:00:48.260> loses<00:00:49.260> sweat<00:00:49.680> volume<00:00:50.370> and<00:00:50.550> a

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
weight or loses sweat volume and a

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.819 
weight or loses sweat volume and a
different<00:00:51.510> rate<00:00:51.719> so<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.110> really<00:00:52.590> have<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
different rate so you really have to

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.729 
different rate so you really have to
determine<00:00:53.340> your<00:00:53.820> old<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.410> now<00:00:55.410> if<00:00:55.559> you're<00:00:55.710> a

real heavy sweater you're going to have
to<00:00:57.480> drink<00:00:57.660> more<00:00:58.550> okay

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 

I<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.659> couple<00:01:07.470> things<00:01:07.680> about<00:01:07.890> things<00:01:08.700> that

I a couple things about things that

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.260 
I a couple things about things that
affect<00:01:09.390> fluid<00:01:10.170> loss<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.220> heat<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.579> the<00:01:11.670> day<00:01:11.880> of

affect fluid loss the heat of the day of
course<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.869> hotter<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.320> is<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.680> more<00:01:14.250> you

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
course the hotter it is the more you

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.450 
course the hotter it is the more you
sweat<00:01:15.200> okay<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:18.360> speed<00:01:18.869> or<00:01:19.289> the<00:01:19.350> intensity<00:01:20.340> of

dark<00:01:52.470> blue<00:01:52.740> nets<00:01:53.039> I'm<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:54.209> kidding<00:01:55.159> actually

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
dark blue nets I'm just kidding actually

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.910 
dark blue nets I'm just kidding actually
I<00:01:56.189> like<00:01:57.090> my<00:01:57.360> white<00:01:57.599> hat<00:01:57.899> so<00:01:58.229> I<00:01:58.289> wear<00:01:58.560> it<00:01:58.590> more

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
I like my white hat so I wear it more

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.399 
I like my white hat so I wear it more
and<00:01:59.369> for<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.729> reason<00:01:59.789> it<00:02:00.330> reflects<00:02:00.869> heat

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
and for that reason it reflects heat

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.589 
and for that reason it reflects heat
rather<00:02:02.099> than<00:02:02.399> absorbs<00:02:03.090> heat<00:02:04.039> acclimatization

00:02:05.589 --> 00:02:05.599 
rather than absorbs heat acclimatization

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.169 
rather than absorbs heat acclimatization
it<00:02:06.599> takes<00:02:06.990> about<00:02:07.140> 10<00:02:07.709> 12<00:02:08.250> days<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.880> acclimatize

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
it takes about 10 12 days to acclimatize

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.170 
it takes about 10 12 days to acclimatize
to<00:02:09.599> heat<00:02:10.049> and<00:02:10.430> so<00:02:11.430> if<00:02:11.549> you're<00:02:11.730> going<00:02:11.850> to<00:02:11.970> apply

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
to heat and so if you're going to apply

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.259 
to heat and so if you're going to apply
a<00:02:12.299> honolulu<00:02:13.109> and<00:02:13.290> do<00:02:13.440> a<00:02:13.470> marathon<00:02:14.030> you<00:02:15.030> should

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:15.269 
a honolulu and do a marathon you should

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.699 
a honolulu and do a marathon you should
figure<00:02:15.480> out<00:02:15.630> a<00:02:15.750> way<00:02:15.959> to<00:02:16.019> get<00:02:16.260> some<00:02:16.470> heat

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
figure out a way to get some heat

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:19.729 
figure out a way to get some heat
running<00:02:17.250> in<00:02:17.549> and<00:02:18.329> one<00:02:18.660> way<00:02:18.900> to<00:02:18.930> do<00:02:19.230> that<00:02:19.260> is<00:02:19.500> to

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
running in and one way to do that is to

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.130 
running in and one way to do that is to
layer<00:02:20.160> your<00:02:20.340> clothes<00:02:20.850> every<00:02:21.510> layer<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
outdoor temperature 10 to 15 degrees so

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.210 
outdoor temperature 10 to 15 degrees so
on<00:02:29.670> a<00:02:29.730> 60<00:02:30.540> degree<00:02:30.660> day<00:02:31.380> and<00:02:31.739> you<00:02:31.859> want<00:02:32.100> to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
on a 60 degree day and you want to

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.430 
on a 60 degree day and you want to
simulate<00:02:32.489> 85<00:02:33.420> you'd<00:02:33.810> have<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.109> worry<00:02:34.319> about

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
simulate 85 you'd have to worry about

why is drinking important blood volume

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.089 
why is drinking important blood volume
is<00:03:33.010> decreased<00:03:33.760> by<00:03:34.000> sweating<00:03:34.470> so<00:03:35.470> whenever

00:03:36.089 --> 00:03:36.099 
is decreased by sweating so whenever

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.890 
is decreased by sweating so whenever
your<00:03:36.400> body<00:03:36.610> you<00:03:36.819> have<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.030> certain<00:03:37.299> volume<00:03:37.540> of

your blood thicker okay heart rate

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.900 
your blood thicker okay heart rate
increases<00:03:46.780> with<00:03:47.620> blood<00:03:47.920> volume<00:03:48.430> and<00:03:48.700> the

blood when you have done a lot of
sweating<00:04:04.600> okay<00:04:05.319> now<00:04:06.100> think<00:04:06.370> about<00:04:06.549> your<00:04:06.730> heart

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
sweating okay now think about your heart

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.289 
sweating okay now think about your heart
when<00:04:08.650> it's<00:04:08.799> coming<00:04:11.190> it's<00:04:12.190> got<00:04:12.489> a<00:04:12.519> pump<00:04:12.880> a<00:04:13.090> lot

water<00:04:17.580> now<00:04:18.580> right<00:04:18.880> here<00:04:19.120> lost<00:04:19.420> three<00:04:19.840> pounds

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.110 
water now right here lost three pounds

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:27.330 
water now right here lost three pounds
and<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:24.360> don't<00:04:25.360> know<00:04:25.450> how<00:04:25.630> much<00:04:25.750> rig<00:04:26.170> weighs<00:04:26.440> 180

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
and I don't know how much rig weighs 180

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.190 
and I don't know how much rig weighs 180
pound<00:04:27.760> person<00:04:28.120> if<00:04:28.570> they<00:04:28.630> lose<00:04:29.380> 3.6<00:04:29.950> pounds

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
pound person if they lose 3.6 pounds

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.640 
pound person if they lose 3.6 pounds
their<00:04:32.940> performance<00:04:34.230> decreases<00:04:35.230> by

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
their performance decreases by

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:39.840 
their performance decreases by
twenty-five<00:04:36.370> percent<00:04:37.920> alright<00:04:38.920> so<00:04:39.610> that's

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
twenty-five percent alright so that's

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.890 
twenty-five percent alright so that's
why<00:04:40.180> it's<00:04:40.390> important<00:04:40.960> to<00:04:41.050> drink<00:04:42.840> of<00:04:43.840> course

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
why it's important to drink of course

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.300 
why it's important to drink of course
with<00:04:44.320> the<00:04:44.470> loss<00:04:44.710> of<00:04:45.010> blood<00:04:45.250> volume<00:04:45.850> you're

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:47.310 
with the loss of blood volume you're

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:52.020 
with the loss of blood volume you're
you're<00:04:48.310> less<00:04:49.000> able<00:04:49.990> to<00:04:50.710> transport<00:04:51.370> heat<00:04:51.730> away

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:52.030 
you're less able to transport heat away

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:54.180 
you're less able to transport heat away
from<00:04:52.180> your<00:04:52.540> working<00:04:52.930> muscles<00:04:53.320> so<00:04:53.920> they<00:04:54.070> get

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
from your working muscles so they get

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.150 
from your working muscles so they get
even<00:04:54.460> hotter<00:04:54.700> so<00:04:55.540> it's<00:04:55.720> a<00:04:55.840> cascade<00:04:56.410> kind<00:04:56.980> of<00:04:57.070> a

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
even hotter so it's a cascade kind of a

00:04:57.160 --> 00:05:01.290 
even hotter so it's a cascade kind of a
date<00:04:57.540> and<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.750> course<00:04:58.780> but<00:04:59.320> less<00:04:59.790> water<00:05:00.790> less

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
okay you need to practice drinking what

okay you need to practice drinking what
we're<00:05:13.810> going<00:05:13.990> to<00:05:14.080> do<00:05:14.230> a<00:05:14.260> portman<00:05:14.830> fit<00:05:15.070> we're

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
we're going to do a portman fit we're

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.430 
we're going to do a portman fit we're

going to eliminate the paper cups should

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:20.310 
going to eliminate the paper cups should

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
have over by the water tables so you all

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.730 
have over by the water tables so you all
have<00:05:20.680> to<00:05:20.890> have<00:05:21.450> one<00:05:22.450> of<00:05:22.510> these<00:05:22.780> things<00:05:23.200> right

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:23.740 
have to have one of these things right
