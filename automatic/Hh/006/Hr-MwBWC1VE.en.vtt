I'm sure are very exciting things
written<00:01:13.259> on<00:01:13.410> it<00:01:13.590> two<00:01:14.490> things<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.880> are

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:14.910 
written on it two things that are

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:17.270 
written on it two things that are
prominently<00:01:15.509> displayed<00:01:15.539> are<00:01:16.289> the<00:01:16.920> fact<00:01:17.220> that

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
prominently displayed are the fact that

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.180 
prominently displayed are the fact that
it<00:01:17.460> supports<00:01:17.850> 128<00:01:18.509> sprites<00:01:18.899> which<00:01:19.679> is<00:01:19.860> quite<00:01:20.160> a

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:20.190 
it supports 128 sprites which is quite a

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.030 
it supports 128 sprites which is quite a
large<00:01:20.460> amount<00:01:20.549> for<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.090> time<00:01:21.270> period<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:22.040> it

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
large amount for that time period and it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.090 
large amount for that time period and it
also<00:01:23.250> promotes<00:01:24.000> its<00:01:24.299> RGB<00:01:24.869> output<00:01:24.900> which<00:01:25.890> I

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
also promotes its RGB output which I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.490 
also promotes its RGB output which I
unfortunately<00:01:26.250> have<00:01:27.000> no<00:01:27.150> way<00:01:27.330> of<00:01:27.479> testing<00:01:27.689> but

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
unfortunately have no way of testing but

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.370 
unfortunately have no way of testing but
it<00:01:28.590> would<00:01:28.710> probably<00:01:28.920> look<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.460> great<00:01:29.880> on

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
it would probably look really great on

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.399 
it would probably look really great on
the<00:01:31.380> back<00:01:31.560> here<00:01:31.979> it<00:01:32.759> again<00:01:33.210> mentions<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.020> RGB

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
the back here it again mentions the RGB

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.760 
the back here it again mentions the RGB
output<00:01:35.810> there's<00:01:36.810> some<00:01:36.900> other<00:01:37.020> info<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.710> you

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
output there's some other info and you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.580 
output there's some other info and you
can<00:01:37.950> see<00:01:38.100> what<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.280> controllers<00:01:38.759> look<00:01:38.909> like

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
can see what the controllers look like

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.580 
can see what the controllers look like
when<00:01:40.590> we<00:01:40.710> open<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.159> box<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:42.229> little<00:01:43.229> flap<00:01:43.439> on

switch box and of course the switch box
itself<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:07.670> don't<00:02:08.670> bother<00:02:08.820> using<00:02:09.119> the<00:02:09.329> switch

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
itself I don't bother using the switch

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.600 
itself I don't bother using the switch
box<00:02:09.660> though<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.170> just<00:02:10.799> use<00:02:10.950> an<00:02:11.070> adapter<00:02:11.430> and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610

this<00:02:15.510> isn't<00:02:16.079> a<00:02:16.200> very<00:02:16.590> large<00:02:16.890> console<00:02:17.900> let's<00:02:18.900> do

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
this isn't a very large console let's do

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.009 
this isn't a very large console let's do
a<00:02:19.380> little<00:02:19.560> comparison<00:02:19.950> here<00:02:20.340> it's<00:02:21.239> a<00:02:21.540> little

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
a little comparison here it's a little

again but with that game you can hear

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.400 
again but with that game you can hear
that<00:05:32.580> it<00:05:32.760> is<00:05:32.790> capable<00:05:33.480> of<00:05:33.630> some<00:05:33.780> pretty<00:05:33.810> varied

only about three feet long you do though

controllers<00:07:04.370> aren't<00:07:04.610> actually<00:07:05.270> that<00:07:05.480> bad<00:07:05.720> to

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.050 
controllers aren't actually that bad to

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:09.160 
controllers aren't actually that bad to
use<00:07:06.340> the<00:07:07.340> small<00:07:07.580> size<00:07:07.880> makes<00:07:08.180> it<00:07:08.360> easy<00:07:08.750> to<00:07:08.990> hold

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:09.170 
use the small size makes it easy to hold

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.320 
use the small size makes it easy to hold
and<00:07:09.530> control<00:07:09.620> doesn't<00:07:10.430> move<00:07:10.940> around<00:07:11.120> in<00:07:11.270> your

00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:11.330 
and control doesn't move around in your

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.720 
and control doesn't move around in your
hand<00:07:11.510> much<00:07:11.750> and<00:07:12.080> it<00:07:12.860> doesn't<00:07:12.980> seem<00:07:13.220> to<00:07:13.370> tire<00:07:13.550> my

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:13.730 
hand much and it doesn't seem to tire my

00:07:13.730 --> 00:07:16.060 
hand much and it doesn't seem to tire my
wrist<00:07:13.940> out<00:07:14.090> that<00:07:14.270> bed<00:07:14.530> it's<00:07:15.530> still<00:07:15.710> not<00:07:15.860> great

00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:16.070 
wrist out that bed it's still not great

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.710 
wrist out that bed it's still not great
but<00:07:16.550> it's<00:07:17.150> okay

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:17.720 
but it's okay

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.770 
but it's okay
and<00:07:18.370> I<00:07:19.370> guess<00:07:19.790> that's<00:07:20.060> pretty<00:07:20.330> much<00:07:20.450> all<00:07:20.750> I

00:07:20.770 --> 00:07:20.780 
and I guess that's pretty much all I

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:23.100 
and I guess that's pretty much all I
have<00:07:21.190> it's<00:07:22.190> a<00:07:22.250> pretty<00:07:22.430> neat<00:07:22.640> little<00:07:22.760> system

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.110 
have it's a pretty neat little system

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:25.480 
have it's a pretty neat little system
I'd<00:07:24.110> like<00:07:24.140> to<00:07:24.470> get<00:07:24.590> more<00:07:24.920> games<00:07:25.100> for<00:07:25.400> it

00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:25.490 
I'd like to get more games for it

00:07:25.490 --> 00:07:27.070 
I'd like to get more games for it
someday<00:07:25.780> especially<00:07:26.780> some<00:07:26.930> of<00:07:26.960> those

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
someday especially some of those

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.320 
someday especially some of those
well-known<00:07:27.530> ones<00:07:27.770> I<00:07:27.980> mentioned<00:07:28.460> before<00:07:28.550> it

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:29.330 
well-known ones I mentioned before it

00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.850 
well-known ones I mentioned before it
would<00:07:29.450> be<00:07:29.570> really<00:07:29.750> fun<00:07:30.020> to<00:07:30.170> see<00:07:30.350> how<00:07:30.500> they<00:07:30.620> play

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:30.860 
would be really fun to see how they play

00:07:30.860 --> 00:07:35.050 
would be really fun to see how they play
