know what the Gibson's made of but some
type<00:00:50.670> of<00:00:50.820> wood<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.800> they're<00:00:52.800> very<00:00:53.610> similar

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
body shapes the Gibson is slightly

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.279 
body shapes the Gibson is slightly
thicker<00:00:57.260> which<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.469> can<00:00:58.680> see<00:00:59.539> but<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.899> shape

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
thicker which you can see but the shape

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.149 
thicker which you can see but the shape
and<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:03.110> scale<00:01:04.110> is<00:01:04.439> exactly<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.979> same

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
and the scale is exactly the same

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.940 
and the scale is exactly the same
between<00:01:05.400> two<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:05.850> them<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.780> Gibson<00:01:07.770> has<00:01:07.920> a

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
between two of them the Gibson has a

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.250 
between two of them the Gibson has a
slightly<00:01:08.250> faster<00:01:08.369> neck<00:01:08.939> which<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.750> nice<00:01:10.080> to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
slightly faster neck which is nice to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.539 
slightly faster neck which is nice to
play<00:01:10.409> from<00:01:11.869> but<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:12.990> God<00:01:13.200> in<00:01:13.430> acoustically<00:01:14.430> is

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
play from but the God in acoustically is

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.270 
play from but the God in acoustically is
much<00:01:14.760> louder<00:01:15.090> and<00:01:15.860> I'm<00:01:16.860> going<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.070> play<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
much louder and I'm going to play a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.240 
much louder and I'm going to play a
little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.820> and<00:01:17.939> play<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> same<00:01:19.250> riff

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
little bit now and play the same riff

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.190 
little bit now and play the same riff
with<00:01:20.580> both<00:01:20.790> guitars<00:01:21.150> acoustic<00:01:21.390> and<00:01:21.990> then

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
with both guitars acoustic and then

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.420 
with both guitars acoustic and then
electric<00:01:22.650> guitar<00:01:22.830> so<00:01:23.009> you<00:01:23.100> can<00:01:23.220> see<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
electric guitar so you can see the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:53.460 
electric guitar so you can see the
difference

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.760 

you

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.510 

okay<00:01:58.770> so<00:01:58.829> that's<00:01:59.369> the<00:02:00.060> God<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> kingpin

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
okay so that's the God in kingpin

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.949 
okay so that's the God in kingpin
acoustic<00:02:04.280> now<00:02:05.280> play<00:02:05.869> the<00:02:06.890> Gibson<00:02:08.179> es<00:02:09.179> 1<00:02:09.420> to<00:02:09.660> 5

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
acoustic now play the Gibson es 1 to 5

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:43.080 
acoustic now play the Gibson es 1 to 5
again<00:02:10.800> acoustic<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.790> same

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.289 

okay<00:02:44.090> so<00:02:44.150> that's<00:02:45.019> the<00:02:45.260> two<00:02:45.409> of<00:02:45.560> them<00:02:46.299> unplugged

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
okay so that's the two of them unplugged

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.390 
okay so that's the two of them unplugged
acoustic<00:02:47.810> I<00:02:47.930> think<00:02:48.170> the<00:02:48.920> Guardian<00:02:49.280> is<00:02:49.370> a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
acoustic I think the Guardian is a

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.030 
acoustic I think the Guardian is a
little<00:02:49.670> louder<00:02:49.879> the<00:02:50.840> Gibson<00:02:51.290> because<00:02:51.829> of<00:02:51.920> its

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:52.040 
little louder the Gibson because of its

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.349 
little louder the Gibson because of its
fatter<00:02:52.250> neck<00:02:52.519> is<00:02:52.639> actually<00:02:52.939> a<00:02:52.969> little<00:02:53.150> nicer

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:53.359 
fatter neck is actually a little nicer

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.039 
fatter neck is actually a little nicer
to<00:02:53.510> play<00:02:53.810> and<00:02:54.109> now<00:02:55.040> I'm<00:02:55.129> going<00:02:55.280> to<00:02:55.340> play

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:56.049 
to play and now I'm going to play

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:00.520 
to play and now I'm going to play
something<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.109> bit<00:02:57.260> more<00:02:57.409> lead<00:02:57.650> II<00:02:58.719> am<00:02:59.719> five

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:00.530 
something a bit more lead II am five

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.000

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
through a Torres I'm fire which is

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.830 
through a Torres I'm fire which is
basically<00:03:04.579> like<00:03:04.879> a<00:03:05.409> fender<00:03:06.409> tweed<00:03:07.840> something

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
basically like a fender tweed something

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.619

rather really sort of clean sound and
real<00:03:11.629> kind<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> jazzy<00:03:12.139> good<00:03:12.470> for<00:03:12.620> blues<00:03:12.829> some

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430

so that's summertime version of it the

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.020 
so that's summertime version of it the
tone<00:03:45.020> pot<00:03:45.440> on<00:03:45.710> this<00:03:45.980> particular<00:03:46.310> car<00:03:46.700> doesn't

tone pot on this particular car doesn't

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.510 
tone pot on this particular car doesn't
work<00:03:47.060> at<00:03:47.300> all<00:03:47.420> so<00:03:47.480> it's<00:03:47.870> turned<00:03:48.140> off<00:03:48.520> but

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
work at all so it's turned off but

work at all so it's turned off but
that's<00:03:49.700> it<00:03:50.770> amplified<00:03:52.270> and<00:03:53.270> now<00:03:53.390> do<00:03:53.450> the<00:03:53.720> same

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:54.020

priced around five hundred pounds in the
UK<00:05:30.270> is<00:05:32.610> probably<00:05:33.610> one<00:05:33.760> of<00:05:33.790> the<00:05:33.940> cheapest<00:05:34.390> arch
