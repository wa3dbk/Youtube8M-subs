that i've done there enamel one has been
the<00:00:41.089> best<00:00:41.300> one<00:00:41.480> so<00:00:41.510> far<00:00:41.749> because<00:00:42.199> material<00:00:42.829> is

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
the best one so far because material is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.189 
the best one so far because material is
really<00:00:43.129> nice<00:00:43.309> to<00:00:43.550> use<00:00:43.579> and<00:00:43.969> the<00:00:44.510> whole<00:00:44.719> day<00:00:44.929> has

00:00:45.189 --> 00:00:45.199

portion of it to the hands-on and i

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.639 
portion of it to the hands-on and i
think<00:00:50.359> it's<00:00:50.510> really<00:00:50.719> important<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.289> have<00:00:51.409> this

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
think it's really important to have this

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:53.739 
think it's really important to have this
hands-on<00:00:52.100> yeah<00:00:52.850> it<00:00:52.969> was<00:00:53.089> informal<00:00:53.539> but<00:00:53.629> that

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:53.749 
hands-on yeah it was informal but that

00:00:53.749 --> 00:00:54.910 
hands-on yeah it was informal but that
made<00:00:53.899> it<00:00:54.050> good<00:00:54.199> because<00:00:54.350> we<00:00:54.530> didn't<00:00:54.769> feel
