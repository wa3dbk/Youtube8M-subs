it's going to give you the feeling that
you're<00:03:03.440> in<00:03:03.470> a<00:03:03.590> much<00:03:03.770> bigger<00:03:04.040> square<00:03:04.520> bag<00:03:04.730> even

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
you're in a much bigger square bag even

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.280 
you're in a much bigger square bag even
though<00:03:05.540> you're<00:03:05.690> getting<00:03:05.780> all<00:03:06.020> the<00:03:06.140> benefits

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
though you're getting all the benefits

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.650 
though you're getting all the benefits
of<00:03:06.680> that<00:03:06.770> closer<00:03:07.190> warmer<00:03:07.940> fit<00:03:08.480> that

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
of that closer warmer fit that

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.270 
of that closer warmer fit that
ultimately<00:03:09.050> keeps<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:09.560> warmer<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.100> it

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
ultimately keeps you warmer and it

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:11.890 
ultimately keeps you warmer and it
reduces<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.760> weight<00:03:10.910> of<00:03:11.030> the<00:03:11.090> bag<00:03:11.270> makes<00:03:11.750> it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
reduces the weight of the bag makes it

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.810 
reduces the weight of the bag makes it
more<00:03:11.990> packable<00:03:12.500> the<00:03:13.130> fabrics<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.640> we're

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
more packable the fabrics that we're

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.640 
more packable the fabrics that we're
using<00:03:13.970> here<00:03:14.240> very<00:03:14.600> lightweight<00:03:14.870> you<00:03:15.470> have<00:03:15.620> a

to get wet the other thing that we

to get wet the other thing that we
incorporate<00:03:26.570> into<00:03:26.690> our<00:03:26.900> design<00:03:27.200> is<00:03:27.380> that<00:03:27.470> we

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
incorporate into our design is that we

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.370 
incorporate into our design is that we
use<00:03:28.120> you<00:03:29.120> can<00:03:29.270> see<00:03:29.420> these<00:03:29.540> three<00:03:29.930> gray

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
use you can see these three gray

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.340 
use you can see these three gray
sections<00:03:30.890> right<00:03:31.010> here<00:03:31.070> we<00:03:32.030> basically<00:03:32.180> use<00:03:32.840> a

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
sections right here we basically use a

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.970 
sections right here we basically use a
synthetic<00:03:34.120> piece<00:03:35.120> of<00:03:35.330> insulation<00:03:36.230> at<00:03:36.770> the

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
synthetic piece of insulation at the

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.750 
synthetic piece of insulation at the
shoulders<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:38.450> hips<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:39.260> feet<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.739> the<00:03:40.580> head

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
shoulders the hips the feet and the head

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.520 
shoulders the hips the feet and the head
of<00:03:40.910> our<00:03:41.000> down<00:03:41.270> bags<00:03:41.570> and<00:03:41.989> what<00:03:42.170> that<00:03:42.290> allows

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
of our down bags and what that allows

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.370 
of our down bags and what that allows
for<00:03:42.910> is<00:03:43.910> a<00:03:44.510> little<00:03:44.810> bit<00:03:44.930> better<00:03:45.080> compression

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
for is a little bit better compression

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.199 
for is a little bit better compression
resistance<00:03:46.040> so<00:03:46.489> when<00:03:46.610> you're<00:03:46.730> sleeping<00:03:47.060> on

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
resistance so when you're sleeping on

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:49.180 
resistance so when you're sleeping on
this<00:03:47.390> these<00:03:47.780> areas<00:03:48.170> where<00:03:48.320> the<00:03:48.410> body<00:03:48.680> tends<00:03:49.010> to

don't take away any down from that area
as<00:04:00.950> well<00:04:01.130> we<00:04:01.700> just<00:04:01.880> know<00:04:01.970> that<00:04:02.000> those<00:04:02.239> pressure

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:02.480 
as well we just know that those pressure

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.030 
as well we just know that those pressure
points<00:04:02.630> where<00:04:03.020> your<00:04:03.110> weight<00:04:03.290> typically<00:04:03.770> loads

points where your weight typically loads

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.250 
points where your weight typically loads
that's<00:04:04.670> where<00:04:04.820> the<00:04:04.880> bag<00:04:05.030> packs<00:04:05.330> out<00:04:05.570> and<00:04:05.840> if

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
that's where the bag packs out and if

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:07.600 
that's where the bag packs out and if
you're<00:04:06.380> not<00:04:06.410> you<00:04:06.860> know<00:04:06.890> say<00:04:07.100> your<00:04:07.250> mats<00:04:07.459> a

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
you're not you know say your mats a

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:08.920 
you're not you know say your mats a
little<00:04:07.790> bit<00:04:07.880> thinner<00:04:08.120> or<00:04:08.360> you're<00:04:08.480> sleeping<00:04:08.600> on

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
little bit thinner or you're sleeping on

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.140 
little bit thinner or you're sleeping on
a<00:04:08.959> cold<00:04:09.380> ground<00:04:09.590> that<00:04:10.520> colds<00:04:10.820> not<00:04:10.850> going<00:04:11.090> to

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
a cold ground that colds not going to

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.920 
a cold ground that colds not going to
get<00:04:11.239> through<00:04:11.450> as<00:04:11.600> much<00:04:12.459> the<00:04:13.459> back<00:04:13.760> fabric<00:04:14.540> here

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
get through as much the back fabric here

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.300 
get through as much the back fabric here
you<00:04:15.019> can<00:04:15.140> see<00:04:15.260> this<00:04:15.350> gray<00:04:15.620> fabric<00:04:16.040> is<00:04:16.160> actually

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
you can see this gray fabric is actually

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.099 
you can see this gray fabric is actually
just<00:04:16.880> slightly<00:04:17.299> heavier<00:04:17.750> than<00:04:17.780> what<00:04:17.989> we've

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
just slightly heavier than what we've

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:19.750 
just slightly heavier than what we've
got<00:04:18.290> going<00:04:18.440> on<00:04:18.590> top<00:04:18.830> that's<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.549> area<00:04:19.669> that

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
got going on top that's the area that

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:20.920 
got going on top that's the area that
takes<00:04:20.030> the<00:04:20.150> biggest<00:04:20.419> beating<00:04:20.570> so<00:04:20.780> that's

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
takes the biggest beating so that's

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.480 
takes the biggest beating so that's
where<00:04:21.049> we<00:04:21.140> want<00:04:21.230> it<00:04:21.350> to<00:04:21.440> be<00:04:21.530> durable<00:04:21.799> and<00:04:22.250> we<00:04:22.400> go

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
where we want it to be durable and we go

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.250 
where we want it to be durable and we go
with<00:04:22.610> a<00:04:22.700> lighter<00:04:22.910> material<00:04:23.060> on<00:04:23.540> top<00:04:23.780> that

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
with a lighter material on top that

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.480 
with a lighter material on top that
helps<00:04:24.500> to<00:04:24.590> make<00:04:24.620> the<00:04:24.800> bag<00:04:24.950> really<00:04:25.280> lightweight

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
helps to make the bag really lightweight

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.700 
helps to make the bag really lightweight
and<00:04:25.850> really<00:04:26.180> packable

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
and really packable

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.200
