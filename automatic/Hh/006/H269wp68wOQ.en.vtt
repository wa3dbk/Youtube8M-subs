00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:04.729 
otherwise it would be higher on the list

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.190 
otherwise it would be higher on the list
but<00:01:05.729> apart<00:01:06.000> from<00:01:06.030> that<00:01:06.180> though<00:01:06.450> has<00:01:06.810> got<00:01:06.990> other

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
actually win right by computing in stuff

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.340 
actually win right by computing in stuff
like<00:01:12.659> speedrun<00:01:13.229> PvP<00:01:13.920> and<00:01:14.040> build<00:01:14.580> competitions

so<00:01:16.350> overall<00:01:16.710> when<00:01:16.950> I<00:01:17.159> would<00:01:17.310> definitely

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
so overall when I would definitely

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.280 
so overall when I would definitely
recommend<00:01:17.670> checking<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.450> even<00:01:19.110> if<00:01:19.200> it

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
recommend checking it out even if it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.480 
recommend checking it out even if it
ought<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.470> play<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:19.740> just<00:01:19.979> to<00:01:20.040> take<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> look<00:01:20.400> at

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
ought to play it just to take a look at

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.100 
ought to play it just to take a look at
the<00:01:20.640> hub<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.390> has<00:01:21.479> got<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.689> really<00:01:21.900> great

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:31.630 

but<00:01:29.990> next<00:01:30.200> in<00:01:30.470> fourth<00:01:30.740> place<00:01:30.830> we<00:01:31.280> have<00:01:31.430> got<00:01:31.610> the

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
but next in fourth place we have got the

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.940 
but next in fourth place we have got the
SGR<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:32.180> harried<00:01:32.450> minecraft<00:01:32.960> server<00:01:33.200> now<00:01:33.920> I

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
SGR and harried minecraft server now I

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.560 
SGR and harried minecraft server now I
did<00:01:34.190> find<00:01:34.430> it<00:01:34.580> really<00:01:34.850> difficult<00:01:34.909> to<00:01:35.390> choose

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
did find it really difficult to choose

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.450 
did find it really difficult to choose
between<00:01:35.690> this<00:01:36.050> server<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.590> the<00:01:37.010> woody<00:01:37.190> craft

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
between this server and the woody craft

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.670 
between this server and the woody craft
server<00:01:37.700> fourth<00:01:38.180> place<00:01:38.450> as<00:01:38.690> again<00:01:39.380> they<00:01:39.619> do

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680
