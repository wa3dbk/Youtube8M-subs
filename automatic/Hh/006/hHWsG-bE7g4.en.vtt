yes

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:46.800 

broken<00:01:42.299> 22<00:01:43.299> bones<00:01:44.939> I'm<00:01:45.939> not<00:01:46.149> sure<00:01:46.360> if<00:01:46.479> you<00:01:46.600> can

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
broken 22 bones I'm not sure if you can

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.179 
broken 22 bones I'm not sure if you can
break<00:01:47.020> that<00:01:47.770> part<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:50.500> pretty<00:01:50.799> sure<00:01:50.920> because

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
break that part I'm pretty sure because

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.529 
break that part I'm pretty sure because
they<00:01:51.310> look<00:01:51.520> like<00:01:51.640> ribs<00:01:52.890> but<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.360> think<00:01:55.360> that's
