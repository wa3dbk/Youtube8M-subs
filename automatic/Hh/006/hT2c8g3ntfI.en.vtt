00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
199 so wasn't like it was the end of the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.550 
199 so wasn't like it was the end of the
world<00:01:10.920> however<00:01:11.510> actually<00:01:12.510> did<00:01:12.750> nothing<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.380> me

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
world however actually did nothing on me

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.240 
world however actually did nothing on me
i<00:01:13.590> like<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.220> purpose<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.110> of<00:01:16.110> these<00:01:16.860> chrome

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
i like the purpose and of these chrome

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.980 
i like the purpose and of these chrome
ones<00:01:17.580> as<00:01:17.880> well<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.300> i<00:01:18.360> thought<00:01:18.570> it<00:01:18.720> would<00:01:18.810> be

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
ones as well so i thought it would be

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.399 
ones as well so i thought it would be
really<00:01:19.170> good<00:01:20.060> it's<00:01:21.060> nice<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.600> bendy<00:01:22.049> and<00:01:22.110> soft

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
really good it's nice and bendy and soft

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.260 
really good it's nice and bendy and soft
so<00:01:22.530> i<00:01:22.590> thought<00:01:22.740> i<00:01:22.799> would<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.370> did<00:01:23.790> nothing

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
so i thought i would it just did nothing

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.110 
so i thought i would it just did nothing
for<00:01:24.299> my<00:01:24.630> lashes<00:01:24.870> to<00:01:25.350> be<00:01:25.470> honest<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:26.070> I've<00:01:26.790> got

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
kind of quite long lashes but they're

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.230 
kind of quite long lashes but they're
not<00:01:29.250> very<00:01:29.520> sick<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:31.940> sometimes<00:01:32.940> they<00:01:33.060> do<00:01:33.119> you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
not very sick and sometimes they do you

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
not very sick and sometimes they do you
need<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.420> bit<00:01:33.600> of<00:01:33.630> building<00:01:34.140> up<00:01:34.229> on<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.530> lashes

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
tried so many oils that I think I face

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:39.970 
tried so many oils that I think I face
the<00:02:38.450> fact<00:02:38.629> that<00:02:38.689> i<00:02:38.810> love<00:02:39.079> my<00:02:39.230> macadamia<00:02:39.799> oil

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
the fact that i love my macadamia oil

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.429 
the fact that i love my macadamia oil
and<00:02:40.220> nothing<00:02:40.549> can<00:02:40.819> touch<00:02:41.090> it<00:02:41.120> and<00:02:41.569> there's<00:02:42.379> a

00:02:42.429 --> 00:02:42.439 
and nothing can touch it and there's a

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:45.160 
and nothing can touch it and there's a
few<00:02:42.620> other<00:02:42.680> oils<00:02:43.189> if<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.549> couldn't<00:02:43.939> ever<00:02:44.209> get<00:02:45.049> my

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
few other oils if I couldn't ever get my

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.990 
few other oils if I couldn't ever get my
macadamia<00:02:45.709> oil<00:02:45.829> again<00:02:46.069> and<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> probably<00:02:46.639> would

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
macadamia oil again and I probably would

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.729 
macadamia oil again and I probably would
use<00:02:47.209> but<00:02:47.239> that<00:02:47.689> is<00:02:47.840> not<00:02:47.959> one<00:02:48.139> of<00:02:48.170> them<00:02:48.349> because

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
use but that is not one of them because

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.979 
use but that is not one of them because
there's<00:02:49.730> a<00:02:49.760> real<00:02:50.000> shame<00:02:50.239> azhar<00:02:50.629> because<00:02:50.900> I

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
there's a real shame azhar because I

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.729 
there's a real shame azhar because I
really<00:02:51.290> really<00:02:51.530> did<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.889> it<00:02:51.920> um<00:02:53.109> and<00:02:54.109> yeah

rejecting<00:05:04.879> them<00:05:05.060> and<00:05:05.440> but<00:05:06.440> this<00:05:06.710> I'm<00:05:07.039> really

00:05:07.959 --> 00:05:07.969 
rejecting them and but this I'm really

upset with because I really like this I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:13.330 
upset with because I really like this I
probably<00:05:09.919> still<00:05:10.400> use<00:05:10.879> it<00:05:11.240> because<00:05:12.139> it<00:05:12.710> is<00:05:13.310> a

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
probably still use it because it is a

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.320 
probably still use it because it is a
really<00:05:13.819> black<00:05:14.449> pencil<00:05:14.870> and<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.889> do<00:05:15.949> like<00:05:16.879> the

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
really black pencil and I do like the

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.619 
really black pencil and I do like the
pencil<00:05:17.810> but<00:05:18.020> um<00:05:18.229> maybe<00:05:18.800> i'm<00:05:19.009> just<00:05:19.039> maybe<00:05:19.629> I

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:20.629 
pencil but um maybe i'm just maybe I

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:22.300 
pencil but um maybe i'm just maybe I
just<00:05:20.810> won't<00:05:20.990> smudge<00:05:21.349> it<00:05:21.469> underneath<00:05:21.770> anymore

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
just won't smudge it underneath anymore

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.180 
just won't smudge it underneath anymore
maybe<00:05:22.490> that's<00:05:22.789> why<00:05:23.889> but<00:05:24.889> that<00:05:25.039> was<00:05:25.159> just

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190 
maybe that's why but that was just

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:27.670 
maybe that's why but that was just
really<00:05:25.580> upset<00:05:25.610> me<00:05:26.000> and<00:05:26.569> then<00:05:26.930> the<00:05:27.229> last<00:05:27.379> thing

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.680 
really upset me and then the last thing

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:31.180 
really upset me and then the last thing
is<00:05:27.889> the<00:05:28.190> model<00:05:28.909> code<00:05:29.150> face<00:05:29.630> based<00:05:29.930> primer<00:05:30.289> is<00:05:31.130> a
