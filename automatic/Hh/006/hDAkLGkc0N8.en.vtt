leaked info but basically the guy who

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.510 
leaked info but basically the guy who
leaked<00:01:33.990> that<00:01:34.049> information<00:01:34.159> actually<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
leaked that information actually did a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.370 
leaked that information actually did a
little<00:01:35.729> bit<00:01:35.880> more<00:01:36.119> of<00:01:36.210> an<00:01:36.299> update<00:01:36.540> today<00:01:36.930> he

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
little bit more of an update today he

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.800 
little bit more of an update today he
actually<00:01:37.590> was<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.070> Twitter<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:38.549> he's

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
actually was on Twitter and he's

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.370 
actually was on Twitter and he's
Brazilian<00:01:39.810> so<00:01:39.930> everything<00:01:40.170> was<00:01:40.259> in

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
Brazilian so everything was in

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.539 
Brazilian so everything was in
Portuguese<00:01:40.829> so<00:01:40.950> I<00:01:40.979> had<00:01:41.100> to<00:01:41.159> do<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> lot<00:01:41.400> of

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
Portuguese so I had to do a lot of

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.730 
Portuguese so I had to do a lot of
translating<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.750> basically<00:01:43.110> what<00:01:43.320> he<00:01:43.470> said

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
translating but basically what he said

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.730 
translating but basically what he said
was<00:01:43.950> that<00:01:44.220> the<00:01:44.790> mode<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.240> not<00:01:45.450> zombies<00:01:46.079> but

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
was that the mode is not zombies but

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.620 
was that the mode is not zombies but
that<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.040> does<00:01:47.250> contain<00:01:47.729> zombies<00:01:48.240> will<00:01:48.420> finish

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
that it does contain zombies will finish

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.030 
that it does contain zombies will finish
so<00:01:48.840> I<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.170> exactly<00:01:49.590> what<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.860> could

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
so I don't know exactly what this could

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.530 
so I don't know exactly what this could
mean<00:01:50.100> let<00:01:50.820> me<00:01:50.880> know<00:01:50.970> what<00:01:51.119> you<00:01:51.180> guys<00:01:51.299> think

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
mean let me know what you guys think

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.639 
mean let me know what you guys think
about<00:01:51.659> that<00:01:51.899> leave<00:01:52.049> some<00:01:52.170> comments<00:01:52.530> down

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
about that leave some comments down

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.710 
about that leave some comments down
below<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.369> most<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.790> can<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.090> about<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.329> it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
below but most I can think about is it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.690 
below but most I can think about is it's
not<00:01:54.899> directly<00:01:55.350> zombie<00:01:55.950> mode<00:01:56.159> but<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.520> might

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
not directly zombie mode but it might

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.510 
not directly zombie mode but it might
have<00:01:56.729> like<00:01:57.450> a<00:01:57.509> boss<00:01:57.869> or<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.290> round<00:01:58.799> or<00:01:59.100> something

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
have like a boss or a round or something

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.069 
have like a boss or a round or something
where<00:01:59.700> zombies<00:02:00.000> come<00:02:00.420> out<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:00.960> be

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
where zombies come out so it could be

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.200 
where zombies come out so it could be
like<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.229> survival<00:02:01.829> type<00:02:02.009> mood<00:02:02.250> where<00:02:02.850> maybe

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
like a survival type mood where maybe

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.760 
like a survival type mood where maybe
there's<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.509> special<00:02:03.780> boss<00:02:04.170> around<00:02:04.500> or<00:02:04.710> a

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
there's a special boss around or a

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:05.190 
there's a special boss around or a
special

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
special

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.260 
special
zombie<00:02:05.619> round<00:02:05.860> where<00:02:06.340> zombies<00:02:06.549> come<00:02:06.880> out<00:02:07.000> or

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
zombie round where zombies come out or

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.359 
zombie round where zombies come out or
another<00:02:07.840> possibility<00:02:08.349> is<00:02:08.590> that<00:02:08.709> it<00:02:09.250> is

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
another possibility is that it is

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.979 
another possibility is that it is
zombies<00:02:09.879> but<00:02:10.360> it's<00:02:10.479> not<00:02:10.569> going<00:02:10.660> to<00:02:10.750> be<00:02:10.840> the

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
zombies but it's not going to be the

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:12.869 
zombies but it's not going to be the
zombies<00:02:11.319> that<00:02:11.440> we<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.800> so<00:02:12.099> let<00:02:12.610> me<00:02:12.700> know<00:02:12.790> what

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:15.750 
you guys think about that now the next
thing<00:02:14.170> he<00:02:14.379> did<00:02:14.530> give<00:02:14.739> us<00:02:14.890> was<00:02:15.099> he<00:02:15.310> said<00:02:15.580> that
