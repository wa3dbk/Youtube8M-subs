00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
one of the better decisions I made in

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.680 
one of the better decisions I made in
the<00:00:17.400> last<00:00:17.870> you<00:00:18.870> know<00:00:18.900> year<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:20.690> I'm

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:21.690 
the last you know year because I'm

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.680 
the last you know year because I'm
enjoying<00:00:22.260> my<00:00:22.560> time<00:00:22.590> I<00:00:23.310> find<00:00:23.970> that<00:00:24.180> I'm<00:00:24.330> not<00:00:24.360> as

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:24.690 
enjoying my time I find that I'm not as

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.690 
enjoying my time I find that I'm not as
insulated<00:00:25.440> from<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.740> weather<00:00:26.070> I<00:00:26.220> think<00:00:26.340> I've

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:26.700 
insulated from the weather I think I've

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.110 
insulated from the weather I think I've
said<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.150> before<00:00:27.620> so<00:00:28.620> that's<00:00:29.400> interesting

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.120 
said that before so that's interesting

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.299 
said that before so that's interesting
when<00:00:30.600> it's<00:00:30.720> cold<00:00:30.990> outside<00:00:31.200> it's<00:00:31.740> colder<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
when it's cold outside it's colder in

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.090 
when it's cold outside it's colder in
here<00:00:32.449> more<00:00:33.449> than<00:00:33.629> it<00:00:33.780> would<00:00:33.929> be<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.379> house<00:00:34.620> by

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
here more than it would be in a house by

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.750 
here more than it would be in a house by
a<00:00:35.129> big<00:00:35.789> big<00:00:36.449> amount<00:00:36.839> and<00:00:37.050> then<00:00:37.890> the<00:00:38.609> other

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
a big big amount and then the other

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.849 
a big big amount and then the other
thing<00:00:39.089> is<00:00:39.269> I'm<00:00:39.449> not<00:00:39.480> insulated<00:00:40.140> from<00:00:40.410> people

00:00:40.849 --> 00:00:40.859 
thing is I'm not insulated from people

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:44.419 
thing is I'm not insulated from people
as<00:00:41.010> much<00:00:41.280> at<00:00:41.550> my<00:00:41.579> old<00:00:41.879> location<00:00:43.429> strangers

00:00:44.419 --> 00:00:44.429 
as much at my old location strangers

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:46.189 
as much at my old location strangers
would<00:00:44.640> just<00:00:44.820> come<00:00:45.030> up<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.539> pull<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
would just come up and pull up and

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:48.139 
would just come up and pull up and
wonder<00:00:46.469> why<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.679> was<00:00:47.039> living<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.789> trailer

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
wonder why I was living in a trailer

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.000 
wonder why I was living in a trailer
there<00:00:48.390> and<00:00:48.629> I'd<00:00:48.749> have<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:48.989> explain<00:00:49.140> about<00:00:49.559> my

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
there and I'd have to explain about my

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
there and I'd have to explain about my
solar<00:00:50.280> panels<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.179> my<00:00:51.440> composting<00:00:52.440> toilet

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
solar panels and my composting toilet

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and occasionally give tours and people

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.229 
and occasionally give tours and people
would<00:00:55.679> come<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.010> barbecue<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.879> was<00:00:56.999> pretty

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

fun and then this location I'm behind a
very<00:01:01.620> large<00:01:02.780> fence<00:01:03.780> so<00:01:04.260> people<00:01:04.890> don't<00:01:05.070> usually

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
very large fence so people don't usually

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:57.650 
him to come back and work fix it though
and<00:01:56.190> didn't<00:01:56.820> want<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.060> man<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.420> my<00:01:57.510> house

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:57.660 
and didn't want that man in my house

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.850 
and didn't want that man in my house
ever<00:01:57.900> again<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.650> then<00:01:59.900> so<00:02:00.900> if<00:02:01.470> I<00:02:01.650> could

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
ever again and then so if I could

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.020 
ever again and then so if I could
improve<00:02:02.130> something<00:02:02.460> I<00:02:02.760> would<00:02:02.880> definitely

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
improve something I would definitely

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.360 
improve something I would definitely
instead<00:02:03.630> of<00:02:03.720> a<00:02:03.810> 24<00:02:04.230> foot<00:02:04.260> travel<00:02:04.620> trailer<00:02:05.160> I

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:05.370 
instead of a 24 foot travel trailer I

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:09.169 
instead of a 24 foot travel trailer I
would<00:02:05.700> push<00:02:06.600> for<00:02:06.630> 30<00:02:07.440> feet<00:02:07.920> I<00:02:08.159> think<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> extra

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
would push for 30 feet I think the extra

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.330 
would push for 30 feet I think the extra
room<00:02:09.450> would<00:02:09.749> make<00:02:10.379> a<00:02:10.409> big<00:02:10.679> difference<00:02:10.799> in<00:02:11.189> my

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
room would make a big difference in my

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.000 
room would make a big difference in my
life<00:02:11.549> I<00:02:12.480> love<00:02:12.840> my<00:02:13.049> composting<00:02:13.680> toy

where places I liked and lived there for

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:45.770 
where places I liked and lived there for
a<00:03:42.720> while<00:03:44.120> this<00:03:45.120> is<00:03:45.180> one<00:03:45.389> where<00:03:45.629> I'm

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
a while this is one where I'm

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.890 
a while this is one where I'm
envisioning<00:03:46.139> my<00:03:46.620> future<00:03:47.359> because<00:03:48.359> what<00:03:48.870> I

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900

about my electricity or water being cut
off<00:05:55.310> and<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:57.560> was<00:05:57.710> a<00:05:57.740> big<00:05:58.160> relief<00:05:58.520> to<00:05:58.760> you<00:05:59.510> know
