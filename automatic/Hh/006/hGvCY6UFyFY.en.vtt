going<00:04:13.150> to<00:04:13.209> run<00:04:13.300> out<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.980> that<00:04:14.980> was<00:04:15.069> rather

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
going to run out so that was rather

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.759 
going to run out so that was rather
unfortunate<00:04:15.580> do<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.479> team<00:04:16.660> didn't<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.440> very

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
unfortunate do the team didn't get very

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.920 
unfortunate do the team didn't get very
many<00:04:18.070> kills<00:04:18.430> so<00:04:18.820> I<00:04:18.850> could<00:04:19.239> have<00:04:19.329> got<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> few

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
many kills so I could have got a few

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.090 
many kills so I could have got a few
more<00:04:20.079> kills<00:04:20.320> I<00:04:20.440> probably<00:04:20.650> could<00:04:20.859> have<00:04:20.889> ended

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
more kills I probably could have ended

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:22.830 
more kills I probably could have ended
it<00:04:21.280> with<00:04:21.370> 80<00:04:21.669> or<00:04:21.880> 90<00:04:22.060> kills<00:04:22.330> this<00:04:22.419> game<00:04:22.600> maybe

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
it with 80 or 90 kills this game maybe

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.140 
it with 80 or 90 kills this game maybe
not<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.080> hundred-foot<00:04:23.650> anyway<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.790> video<00:04:25.030> is

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150
