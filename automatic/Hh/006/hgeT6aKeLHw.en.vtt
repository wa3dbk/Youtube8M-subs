00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.379 
pretty good so far the top to get the
top<00:06:40.210> score<00:06:40.599> of<00:06:40.659> 25,000<00:06:41.500> points<00:06:41.680> I<00:06:45.180> think<00:06:46.180> that

00:06:46.379 --> 00:06:46.389 
top score of 25,000 points I think that

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:48.089 
top score of 25,000 points I think that
ring<00:06:46.750> thing<00:06:47.050> is<00:06:47.199> pretty<00:06:47.409> much<00:06:47.500> a<00:06:47.560> carryover

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
ring thing is pretty much a carryover

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.790 
ring thing is pretty much a carryover
from<00:06:48.310> the<00:06:49.080> arcade

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
from the arcade

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:55.589 
from the arcade
I<00:06:52.710> would<00:06:53.710> actually<00:06:54.159> keep<00:06:54.759> track<00:06:54.940> of<00:06:55.419> high

00:06:55.589 --> 00:06:55.599 
I would actually keep track of high

00:06:55.599 --> 00:07:13.130 
I would actually keep track of high
scores

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:13.140 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.480 

hopefully<00:07:14.140> I<00:07:14.170> wanted<00:07:14.470> to<00:07:14.560> see<00:07:14.680> my<00:07:14.890> timeline<00:07:15.340> if

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:15.490 
hopefully I wanted to see my timeline if

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:24.000 
hopefully I wanted to see my timeline if
I<00:07:15.640> just<00:07:15.910> might<00:07:16.210> owe<00:07:19.590> so<00:07:20.590> much<00:07:20.650> for<00:07:20.920> that<00:07:23.010> and

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:24.010 
I just might owe so much for that and

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.380 
I just might owe so much for that and
that<00:07:25.000> is<00:07:25.030> balloon<00:07:25.960> fight<00:07:26.290> Lee's<00:07:26.500> coming<00:07:27.390> so
