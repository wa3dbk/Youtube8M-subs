00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:41.940 
students are on Khan Academy I do this

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.550 
students are on Khan Academy I do this
in<00:01:42.090> many<00:01:42.270> different<00:01:42.539> ways<00:01:42.869> the<00:01:43.080> first<00:01:43.259> way<00:01:43.440> I

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
in many different ways the first way I

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.230 
in many different ways the first way I
do<00:01:43.680> this<00:01:43.800> is<00:01:43.979> making<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.369> huge<00:01:44.640> part<00:01:45.030> of<00:01:45.090> their

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
do this is making a huge part of their

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.630 
do this is making a huge part of their
grade<00:01:45.539> this<00:01:46.500> trimester<00:01:47.039> it's<00:01:47.160> going<00:01:47.399> to<00:01:47.490> count

grade this trimester it's going to count

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.240 
grade this trimester it's going to count
is<00:01:47.789> forty<00:01:48.539> percent<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.990> their<00:01:49.200> grade<00:01:49.410> so

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
is forty percent of their grade so

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.710 
is forty percent of their grade so
