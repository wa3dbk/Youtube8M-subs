 I do not listen I enjoy without your presence 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:24.690

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.420
 there are many roads 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.400
 Without forget 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.409

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.409

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:13.750
 of caborca ​​sonora alexis montoya with 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:16.599
 all this emotion in this song can 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:18.849
 see the jury applauding today 

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.500
 the one with the highest rating 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:24.849
 will have the opportunity to sing the theme 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.069
 main of the telenovela the other side 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:30.310
 of the soul so that he who has the 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.220
 higher grade may choose to sing 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.629
 this topic is that today if 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.910
 they are fighting not only their stay 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.340
 in the academy but being in this 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.069
 place that is something something wonderful now 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.739
 if Marta listens if it is that I 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:49.750
 I want to say the xxi is a thing because to 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:51.910
 me you look like an artist that has 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.280
 many things in his favor 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.480
 and I always see in you that there is a certain 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.849
 insecurity 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:04.659
 I do not like it because I want to tell you 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:07.540
 one thing I am very intuitive and good not 

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:09.280
 I know yes, I think I hit a lot 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:12.970
 when I see a person who can get 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.860
 high and you think you can do it 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:20.830
 because you have a very voice color 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:24.250
 staff a voice that penetrates I do not know 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.930
 your color your way of singing is has 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.540
 such sensitivity 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.069
 is what I like well a singer who 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.049
 Count not that you sing and you count 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:37.870
 believe it a little more man really 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.959
 You will see me and yesterday you would give 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.290
 a but alexis with the interpretation of 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.290
 today 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:49.049
 I think countryman who are few times 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.720
 few times that does not make us feel 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.519
 always makes us feel always makes us 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.250
 vibrate 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.549
 as that voice says that you have 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:01.830
 it's really super strong and I see you 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:03.540

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.690
 alexis I think that choice is a voice 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:15.730
 only not and the truth is 172 detuning 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.949

 know up to the incidental subject of a 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.960
 novel called James and I had to 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:41.350
 lose 25 years to make a theme of 

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.199

 important that the academy so 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.850
