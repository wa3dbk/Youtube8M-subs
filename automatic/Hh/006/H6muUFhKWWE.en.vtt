most important pieces of the bunch this

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.100 
most important pieces of the bunch this
is<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.850> they<00:01:02.969> frame<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.539> shape<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.930> rest

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
is because they frame and shape the rest

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
curl now the second way we're gonna take

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.210 
curl now the second way we're gonna take
our<00:01:48.990> straightener<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> we're<00:01:49.740> gonna<00:01:49.860> curl

inwards while twisting at the same time

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.830

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
way is the exact same way except for

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.690 
way is the exact same way except for
