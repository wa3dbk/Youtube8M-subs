00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:46.260 
chopping so remember just using half of

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.520 
chopping so remember just using half of
green<00:01:46.470> pepper<00:01:47.180> and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.540> we're<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.440> to

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
green pepper and then we're going to

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.490 
green pepper and then we're going to
just<00:01:49.710> cut<00:01:50.010> that<00:01:50.160> into<00:01:50.910> small<00:01:51.240> pieces<00:01:53.870> so<00:01:54.870> the

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
just cut that into small pieces so the

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.080 
just cut that into small pieces so the
chilli<00:01:57.650> I'm<00:01:58.650> going<00:01:58.830> to<00:01:58.890> cut<00:01:59.070> that<00:01:59.190> in<00:01:59.250> half<00:01:59.370> now

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
chilli I'm going to cut that in half now

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.690 
chilli I'm going to cut that in half now
I<00:02:00.590> suggested<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.680> fairly<00:02:01.980> small<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.490> me<00:02:02.580> this

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I suggested a fairly small to me this

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.030 
I suggested a fairly small to me this
one<00:02:02.910> is<00:02:03.060> I'd<00:02:03.660> say<00:02:03.960> quite<00:02:04.110> a<00:02:04.230> good<00:02:04.440> size<00:02:04.650> chilli

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
one is I'd say quite a good size chilli

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.470 
one is I'd say quite a good size chilli
so<00:02:05.250> I'm<00:02:05.400> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.730> take<00:02:05.909> the<00:02:06.030> seeds<00:02:06.240> out

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
so I'm going to take the seeds out

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:09.050 
so I'm going to take the seeds out
because<00:02:07.470> that<00:02:07.650> adds<00:02:07.800> extra<00:02:08.099> heat<00:02:08.610> and<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:08.819> think

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
because that adds extra heat and I think

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.190 
because that adds extra heat and I think
we've<00:02:09.149> probably<00:02:09.269> got<00:02:09.479> plenty<00:02:09.780> with<00:02:10.140> the

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
we've probably got plenty with the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.930 
we've probably got plenty with the
amount<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.470> chilli

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
amount of chilli

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.310 
amount of chilli
