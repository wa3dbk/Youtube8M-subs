we say once you come here you can never

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.420 
we say once you come here you can never
leave<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.540> it's<00:03:31.380> true<00:03:31.650> in<00:03:31.769> a<00:03:31.859> lot<00:03:32.069> of<00:03:32.100> phases

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
leave and it's true in a lot of phases

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:34.550 
leave and it's true in a lot of phases
and<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.819> lot<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:32.970> ways<00:03:33.209> and<00:03:33.480> so<00:03:33.660> I<00:03:33.930> think<00:03:34.290> about

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
and a lot of ways and so I think about

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199 
and a lot of ways and so I think about
that<00:03:34.709> a<00:03:34.889> lot<00:03:35.130> because<00:03:35.280> it<00:03:35.519> reminds<00:03:35.910> me<00:03:35.940> of<00:03:36.090> all

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
that a lot because it reminds me of all

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.059 
that a lot because it reminds me of all
the<00:03:36.239> people<00:03:36.450> who<00:03:36.780> maybe<00:03:37.290> live<00:03:37.530> somewhere<00:03:37.920> else

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
the people who maybe live somewhere else

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:39.229 
the people who maybe live somewhere else
but<00:03:38.310> they're<00:03:38.489> still<00:03:38.639> very<00:03:38.760> much<00:03:38.910> a<00:03:38.970> part<00:03:39.209> of

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
but they're still very much a part of

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.120 
but they're still very much a part of
what<00:03:39.329> we<00:03:39.480> do<00:03:39.599> the<00:03:40.049> top<00:03:40.260> picture<00:03:40.500> the<00:03:40.739> only<00:03:40.829> one
