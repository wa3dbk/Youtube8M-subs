00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
hi everyone welcome back so in this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.140 
hi everyone welcome back so in this
tutorial<00:00:10.710> we're<00:00:11.190> going<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:11.460> be<00:00:11.670> talking<00:00:11.940> about

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
tutorial we're going to be talking about

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.660 
tutorial we're going to be talking about
tracing<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.410> cutting<00:00:13.769> out<00:00:13.920> your<00:00:13.950> fabric

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
tracing and cutting out your fabric

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.460 
tracing and cutting out your fabric
using<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.240> pattern<00:00:15.540> pieces<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.289> had

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:16.470 
using the pattern pieces that you had

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.590 
using the pattern pieces that you had
made<00:00:16.680> previously<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:18.029> you<00:00:18.090> should<00:00:18.510> have

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
made previously so you should have

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.439 
made previously so you should have
already<00:00:19.130> prepared<00:00:20.130> your<00:00:20.220> fabric<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.029> if<00:00:21.300> you

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
already prepared your fabric so if you

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.060 
already prepared your fabric so if you
wanted<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> pre<00:00:22.199> wash<00:00:22.410> it<00:00:22.619> you<00:00:22.710> should<00:00:22.920> have

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
wanted to pre wash it you should have

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.950 
wanted to pre wash it you should have
pre<00:00:23.279> washed<00:00:23.519> it<00:00:23.730> and<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.330> should<00:00:24.480> also<00:00:24.630> have

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
pre washed it and you should also have

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.230 
pre washed it and you should also have
ironed<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.650> very<00:00:26.039> very<00:00:26.430> thoroughly<00:00:26.789> I

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
ironed it out very very thoroughly I

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.320 
ironed it out very very thoroughly I
have<00:00:27.960> some<00:00:28.710> scrap<00:00:29.010> paper<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.550> not

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
have some scrap paper here that not

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.389 
have some scrap paper here that not
scrap<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:30.779> like<00:00:30.990> some<00:00:31.230> scrap<00:00:31.679> fabric<00:00:31.710> here

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
scrap you like some scrap fabric here

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.549 
scrap you like some scrap fabric here
that<00:00:32.910> I'm<00:00:33.149> going<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.450> be<00:00:33.600> doing<00:00:33.750> examples<00:00:34.380> on

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
that I'm going to be doing examples on

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
that I'm going to be doing examples on
and<00:00:34.800> I've<00:00:34.920> attacked<00:00:35.309> it<00:00:35.489> briefly<00:00:35.790> with<00:00:36.239> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
and I've attacked it briefly with the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.350 
and I've attacked it briefly with the
iron<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:38.280> obviously<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.239> be<00:00:39.329> a

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
iron but you obviously want to be a

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.860 
iron but you obviously want to be a
little<00:00:39.600> bit<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:39.899> thorough<00:00:40.610> okay<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.149> let's

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
little bit more thorough okay so let's

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.350 
little bit more thorough okay so let's
start<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.140> tracing<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.340> what<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.820> have<00:00:45.000> here

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
start with tracing so what you have here

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970 
start with tracing so what you have here
you<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.780> your<00:00:46.079> pattern<00:00:46.379> piece<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.860> you've

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
you have your pattern piece that you've

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.330 
you have your pattern piece that you've
already<00:00:47.160> prepared<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:48.030> you<00:00:48.989> also<00:00:49.230> have<00:00:49.710> your

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
already prepared and you also have your

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.660 
already prepared and you also have your
fabric<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.090> you're<00:00:51.239> going<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> lay<00:00:51.780> down<00:00:52.050> your

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:52.670 
fabric so you're going to lay down your

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.010 
fabric so you're going to lay down your
pattern<00:00:53.670> piece<00:00:53.879> onto<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.360> fabric<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:54.930> you

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
pattern piece onto the fabric and you

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.830 
pattern piece onto the fabric and you
can<00:00:55.500> pin<00:00:55.770> it<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.039> place<00:00:56.280> or<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:57.180> can<00:00:57.390> use<00:00:57.629> any

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
can pin it in place or you can use any

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.069 
can pin it in place or you can use any
sort<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.760> temporary<00:00:59.760> adhesive<00:01:00.059> if<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.989> to

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
sort of temporary adhesive if we want to

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.840 
sort of temporary adhesive if we want to
or<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.379> can<00:01:01.530> just<00:01:01.680> hold<00:01:01.859> it<00:01:02.039> down<00:01:02.160> flat<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
or you can just hold it down flat if you

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.549 
or you can just hold it down flat if you
want<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.629> have<00:01:03.660> a<00:01:03.809> steady<00:01:04.080> hand<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.500> you

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
want if you have a steady hand and you

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.840 
want if you have a steady hand and you
don't<00:01:04.739> think<00:01:04.949> it's<00:01:05.070> going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> shift<00:01:05.430> around

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
don't think it's going to shift around

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.520 
don't think it's going to shift around
and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.659> what<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.350> is

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
and then what you're going to do is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.859 
and then what you're going to do is
you're<00:01:07.710> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.189> use<00:01:08.760> something<00:01:09.060> to<00:01:09.420> trace

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
you're going to use something to trace

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
you're going to use something to trace
around<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.320> pattern<00:01:10.350> piece<00:01:10.920> so<00:01:11.460> that<00:01:11.700> you

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
around the pattern piece so that you

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.539 
around the pattern piece so that you
have<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> very<00:01:13.380> precise<00:01:13.830> shape<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.430> you

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
have the very precise shape that you

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.640 
have the very precise shape that you
need<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:15.420> what<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.869> use<00:01:16.200> for<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
need so what you can use for this

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
need so what you can use for this
tracing<00:01:17.220> I've<00:01:17.520> used<00:01:17.909> pencils<00:01:18.920> it's<00:01:19.920> been

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
tracing I've used pencils it's been

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.999 
tracing I've used pencils it's been
appropriate<00:01:21.119> for<00:01:21.150> me<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:22.020> marks<00:01:22.590> well<00:01:22.799> on

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
appropriate for me if it marks well on

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.510 
appropriate for me if it marks well on
the<00:01:23.130> fabric<00:01:23.490> I'm<00:01:23.640> using<00:01:24.080> I've<00:01:25.080> also<00:01:25.320> used<00:01:25.770> this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
the fabric I'm using I've also used this

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
the fabric I'm using I've also used this
marker<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.180> I've<00:01:27.450> showed<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.020> this<00:01:28.409> in

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
marker here I've showed you this in

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.590 
marker here I've showed you this in
previous<00:01:29.009> tutorials<00:01:29.579> and<00:01:29.850> I'll<00:01:30.030> show<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.299> how

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
previous tutorials and I'll show you how

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.810 
previous tutorials and I'll show you how
it<00:01:30.780> works<00:01:30.930> it's<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.680> erasable<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.729> you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
it works it's actually erasable so you

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.429 
it works it's actually erasable so you
can<00:01:33.090> make<00:01:33.240> any<00:01:33.450> sort<00:01:33.720> of<00:01:33.810> mark<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.290> like

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
can make any sort of mark on it like

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:38.240 
can make any sort of mark on it like
this<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.900> over<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.259> course<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.619> a<00:01:37.710> few<00:01:37.920> hours

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
this and over the course of a few hours

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.760 
this and over the course of a few hours
or<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.460> few<00:01:38.520> days<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.240> will<00:01:39.689> fade<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.110> its<00:01:40.320> own<00:01:40.500> if

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
or a few days it will fade on its own if

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.639 
or a few days it will fade on its own if
you're<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:41.520> hurry<00:01:41.670> though<00:01:42.170> then<00:01:43.170> just<00:01:43.470> use

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
you're in a hurry though then just use

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.940 
you're in a hurry though then just use
the<00:01:43.680> back<00:01:44.670> side<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.030> this<00:01:45.390> and<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:46.619> has<00:01:46.649> an

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
the back side of this and it has an

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.469 
the back side of this and it has an
eraser<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> look<00:01:47.759> at<00:01:47.909> that<00:01:48.350> magic<00:01:50.479> always

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
eraser and look at that magic always

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.200 
eraser and look at that magic always
make<00:01:51.840> sure<00:01:52.020> that<00:01:52.200> you<00:01:52.320> do<00:01:52.560> a<00:01:52.829> spot<00:01:53.220> test<00:01:53.490> before

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
make sure that you do a spot test before

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.999 
make sure that you do a spot test before
using<00:01:54.450> this<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:54.960> your<00:01:55.079> fabric<00:01:55.439> though<00:01:55.590> because

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
using this on your fabric though because

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.370 
using this on your fabric though because
there<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> off<00:01:57.479> chance<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:58.020> it<00:01:58.170> not<00:01:58.320> being

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
there is the off chance of it not being

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.060 
there is the off chance of it not being
able<00:01:58.950> to<00:01:59.100> comment<00:01:59.549> later<00:01:59.670> on<00:01:59.969> so<00:02:00.799> yeah<00:02:01.799> that's

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
able to comment later on so yeah that's

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.219 
able to comment later on so yeah that's
that<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.850> also<00:02:03.000> use<00:02:03.210> tailors<00:02:03.689> chalk<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
that you can also use tailors chalk and

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.810 
that you can also use tailors chalk and
you<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.619> have<00:02:04.740> tailors<00:02:05.130> chalk<00:02:05.159> because<00:02:05.579> I'm

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you don't have tailors chalk because I'm

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.260 
you don't have tailors chalk because I'm
cheap<00:02:06.560> and<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.340> also<00:02:08.520> use<00:02:08.940> chalk<00:02:09.450> paper

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
cheap and you can also use chalk paper

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.690 
cheap and you can also use chalk paper
and<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.390> tracing<00:02:11.320> wheel<00:02:11.470> so<00:02:12.010> let<00:02:12.310> me<00:02:12.430> show<00:02:12.610> you

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
and a tracing wheel so let me show you

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.420 
and a tracing wheel so let me show you
how<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.880> works<00:02:13.620> all<00:02:14.620> right<00:02:14.860> guys<00:02:15.040> so<00:02:15.220> I<00:02:15.250> hope

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
how that works all right guys so I hope

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.040 
how that works all right guys so I hope
you<00:02:15.580> can<00:02:15.700> see<00:02:15.910> this<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.450> actually<00:02:16.720> the

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:17.050 
you can see this this is actually the

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:18.720 
you can see this this is actually the
second<00:02:17.380> time<00:02:17.410> I'm<00:02:17.650> recording<00:02:18.100> the<00:02:18.220> first<00:02:18.370> part

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
second time I'm recording the first part

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.580 
second time I'm recording the first part
here<00:02:18.970> because<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.660> forgot<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.410> mention

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
here because I forgot to mention

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.690 
here because I forgot to mention
something<00:02:21.150> important<00:02:22.150> beforehand<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:24.040> have<00:02:24.550> my

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
scrap fabric here you're obviously going

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.230 
scrap fabric here you're obviously going
to<00:02:26.860> be<00:02:27.010> using<00:02:27.340> something<00:02:27.550> a<00:02:27.730> little<00:02:27.940> bit<00:02:28.060> more

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
to be using something a little bit more

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.020 
to be using something a little bit more
sturdy<00:02:28.510> for<00:02:28.810> your<00:02:28.960> course<00:02:29.230> of<00:02:29.410> fabric<00:02:29.740> but

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
sturdy for your course of fabric but

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.730 
sturdy for your course of fabric but

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
nevertheless even if you have the

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.220 
nevertheless even if you have the
tightest<00:02:33.130> woven<00:02:33.580> fabric<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.060> the<00:02:34.180> world<00:02:34.360> it<00:02:34.630> is

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
tightest woven fabric in the world it is

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.110 
tightest woven fabric in the world it is
still<00:02:35.590> going<00:02:35.860> to<00:02:35.950> have<00:02:36.220> some<00:02:36.250> stretch<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.030> had

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
still going to have some stretch I had

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.460 
still going to have some stretch I had
mentioned<00:02:37.450> that<00:02:37.540> before<00:02:37.660> it's<00:02:38.020> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.320> have

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
mentioned that before it's going to have

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.470 
mentioned that before it's going to have
some<00:02:38.740> ease<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.250> it<00:02:39.280> especially<00:02:40.180> along<00:02:40.420> the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
some ease to it especially along the

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.320 
some ease to it especially along the
bias<00:02:40.840> what<00:02:41.440> the<00:02:41.560> bias<00:02:41.740> is<00:02:42.070> is<00:02:42.280> a<00:02:42.310> 45<00:02:42.910> degree

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
bias what the bias is is a 45 degree

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:46.200 
bias what the bias is is a 45 degree
angle<00:02:43.810> so<00:02:43.990> you<00:02:44.380> can<00:02:44.890> see<00:02:45.160> if<00:02:45.370> I<00:02:45.550> pull<00:02:45.880> on<00:02:45.910> it

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
angle so you can see if I pull on it

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.080 
angle so you can see if I pull on it
this<00:02:46.330> way<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:46.750> stretches<00:02:47.320> readily<00:02:47.920> if<00:02:48.250> I<00:02:48.760> pull

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
this way it stretches readily if I pull

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.870 
this way it stretches readily if I pull
on<00:02:49.120> it<00:02:49.480> lengthwise<00:02:50.230> though<00:02:50.740> it<00:02:51.070> will<00:02:51.640> not

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
on it lengthwise though it will not

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.440 
on it lengthwise though it will not
stretch<00:02:52.240> quite<00:02:52.540> so<00:02:52.810> readily<00:02:53.190> so<00:02:54.300> what<00:02:55.300> this

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
stretch quite so readily so what this

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.420 
stretch quite so readily so what this
means<00:02:55.510> is<00:02:55.960> you<00:02:56.020> want<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.470> align<00:02:56.860> your<00:02:57.040> pattern

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
means is you want to align your pattern

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.060 
means is you want to align your pattern
pieces<00:02:57.640> along<00:02:58.210> the<00:02:58.480> grain<00:02:58.750> here<00:02:59.170> and<00:02:59.350> the

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
pieces along the grain here and the

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.280 
pieces along the grain here and the
easiest<00:03:00.340> way<00:03:00.490> to<00:03:00.520> do<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:00.790> is<00:03:01.210> to<00:03:01.570> align<00:03:02.080> it

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
easiest way to do that is to align it

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.560 
easiest way to do that is to align it
along<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.010> selvage<00:03:03.430> where<00:03:03.820> the<00:03:03.910> selvage<00:03:04.240> is

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
along the selvage where the selvage is

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:10.100 
along the selvage where the selvage is
it's<00:03:05.520> it's<00:03:06.520> this<00:03:07.150> already<00:03:07.900> cut<00:03:08.250> lengthwise

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.110 
it's it's this already cut lengthwise

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.830 
it's it's this already cut lengthwise
side<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.560> so<00:03:12.240> I'm<00:03:13.240> going<00:03:13.450> to<00:03:13.540> take<00:03:13.690> my

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
side here so I'm going to take my

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.720 
side here so I'm going to take my
pattern<00:03:14.200> piece<00:03:14.380> and<00:03:14.709> not<00:03:14.860> my<00:03:15.010> pattern<00:03:15.370> piece<00:03:15.490> I

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
pattern piece and not my pattern piece I

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.620 
pattern piece and not my pattern piece I
actually<00:03:15.970> had<00:03:16.360> marked<00:03:16.780> lengthwise<00:03:17.380> what

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:18.630 
actually had marked lengthwise what

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.560 
actually had marked lengthwise what
where<00:03:19.630> the<00:03:19.840> grain<00:03:20.080> should<00:03:20.350> lie<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:21.310> I<00:03:21.910> will

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
where the grain should lie so I will

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:25.770 
where the grain should lie so I will
just<00:03:22.840> lie<00:03:23.520> my<00:03:24.520> pattern<00:03:24.850> piece<00:03:25.000> like<00:03:25.209> this<00:03:25.420> and

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
just lie my pattern piece like this and

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.470 
just lie my pattern piece like this and
then<00:03:26.140> I'll<00:03:26.260> actually<00:03:26.440> take<00:03:26.830> a<00:03:26.860> ruler<00:03:27.130> and<00:03:27.490> I'm

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
then I'll actually take a ruler and I'm

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.949 
then I'll actually take a ruler and I'm
going<00:03:28.870> to<00:03:29.020> measure<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.800> make<00:03:30.730> sure<00:03:31.060> that<00:03:31.780> it

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
going to measure and make sure that it

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.890 
going to measure and make sure that it
is<00:03:32.110> perfectly<00:03:32.560> parallel<00:03:32.830> with<00:03:33.160> the<00:03:33.280> salvage

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
is perfectly parallel with the salvage

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:39.150 
is perfectly parallel with the salvage
so<00:03:34.900> right<00:03:35.110> here<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:36.160> about<00:03:37.950> ninety<00:03:38.950> three

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
so right here it's about ninety three

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:49.899 
so right here it's about ninety three
millimeters<00:03:40.860> here

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:49.909 

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.149 

okay<00:03:50.909> so<00:03:51.420> that's<00:03:51.569> more<00:03:51.840> or<00:03:51.959> less<00:03:51.989> good<00:03:52.319> and

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
okay so that's more or less good and

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.550 
okay so that's more or less good and
once<00:03:54.120> you<00:03:54.269> have<00:03:54.450> it<00:03:54.599> perfectly<00:03:54.989> on<00:03:55.230> grain

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
once you have it perfectly on grain

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.680 
once you have it perfectly on grain
you're<00:03:55.830> going<00:03:56.040> to<00:03:56.159> pin<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.489> or<00:03:56.760> use<00:03:57.090> some<00:03:57.420> sort

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
you're going to pin it or use some sort

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.630 
you're going to pin it or use some sort
of<00:03:57.810> adhesive<00:03:58.019> to<00:03:58.830> make<00:03:59.040> sure<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.340> doesn't

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
of adhesive to make sure it doesn't

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.789 
of adhesive to make sure it doesn't
shift<00:03:59.670> around<00:04:00.260> next<00:04:01.260> what<00:04:01.409> you're<00:04:01.470> going<00:04:01.530> to

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
shift around next what you're going to

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.410 
shift around next what you're going to
do<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.159> you're<00:04:02.340> going<00:04:02.489> to<00:04:02.610> take<00:04:02.940> your<00:04:03.180> chalk

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
do is you're going to take your chalk

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.070 
do is you're going to take your chalk
paper<00:04:03.720> so<00:04:04.560> here's<00:04:05.069> the<00:04:05.220> chalk<00:04:05.430> paper<00:04:05.670> and<00:04:06.080> the

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
paper so here's the chalk paper and the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.650 
paper so here's the chalk paper and the
the<00:04:07.920> more<00:04:08.099> colored<00:04:08.489> side<00:04:08.730> is<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.239> side<00:04:09.450> with<00:04:09.629> a

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
the more colored side is the side with a

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.869 
the more colored side is the side with a
chalk<00:04:09.989> and<00:04:10.200> you<00:04:10.230> want<00:04:10.500> that<00:04:10.680> facing<00:04:11.430> your

00:04:11.869 --> 00:04:11.879 
chalk and you want that facing your

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.210 
chalk and you want that facing your
fabric<00:04:12.360> because<00:04:12.750> if<00:04:13.049> you<00:04:13.290> have<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.709> non<00:04:13.860> chalk

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
fabric because if you have the non chalk

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.890 
fabric because if you have the non chalk
side<00:04:14.489> facing<00:04:14.879> your<00:04:14.940> fabric<00:04:15.299> nothing's<00:04:15.660> going

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
side facing your fabric nothing's going

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:22.490 
side facing your fabric nothing's going
to<00:04:15.930> mark<00:04:16.199> so<00:04:17.190> put<00:04:18.090> this<00:04:18.239> on<00:04:18.540> top<00:04:18.930> here<00:04:19.380> and<00:04:21.500> make

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
to mark so put this on top here and make

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.320 
to mark so put this on top here and make
sure<00:04:22.770> that<00:04:23.130> the<00:04:23.370> side<00:04:23.580> that<00:04:23.729> you're<00:04:23.850> marking

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:24.330 
sure that the side that you're marking

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.480 
sure that the side that you're marking
is<00:04:24.479> the<00:04:24.750> wrong<00:04:24.990> side<00:04:25.320> of<00:04:25.470> your<00:04:25.500> fabric<00:04:25.620> because

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
is the wrong side of your fabric because

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:29.270 
is the wrong side of your fabric because
even<00:04:27.270> if<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.510> chalk<00:04:27.750> is<00:04:27.990> able<00:04:28.350> to<00:04:28.500> rub<00:04:28.680> out<00:04:28.860> you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
even if the chalk is able to rub out you

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.400 
even if the chalk is able to rub out you
still<00:04:29.580> don't<00:04:29.910> want<00:04:30.300> to<00:04:30.449> run<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:30.960> risk<00:04:31.139> of

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
still don't want to run the risk of

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.200 
still don't want to run the risk of
marking<00:04:32.220> up<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.490> good<00:04:32.639> side<00:04:32.850> of<00:04:32.880> your<00:04:33.060> fabric

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:33.210 
marking up the good side of your fabric

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.060 
marking up the good side of your fabric
which<00:04:33.510> is<00:04:33.539> going<00:04:33.810> to<00:04:33.900> be<00:04:34.080> you<00:04:34.289> know<00:04:34.410> presented

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
which is going to be you know presented

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:38.270 
which is going to be you know presented
to<00:04:35.729> the<00:04:35.850> world<00:04:36.470> so<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.830> make<00:04:37.979> sure<00:04:38.010> you're

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
to the world so just make sure you're

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.620 
to the world so just make sure you're
always<00:04:38.460> marking<00:04:38.880> the<00:04:39.000> wrong<00:04:39.180> side<00:04:39.419> of<00:04:39.600> your

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:39.630 
always marking the wrong side of your

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:42.950 
always marking the wrong side of your
fabric<00:04:39.750> and<00:04:41.180> now<00:04:42.180> what<00:04:42.449> you're<00:04:42.539> going<00:04:42.750> to<00:04:42.840> do

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:42.960 
fabric and now what you're going to do

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:44.180 
fabric and now what you're going to do
you're<00:04:43.110> going<00:04:43.139> to<00:04:43.380> take<00:04:43.560> your<00:04:43.710> tracing<00:04:43.889> wheel

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
you're going to take your tracing wheel

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.909 
you're going to take your tracing wheel
and<00:04:44.460> you're<00:04:44.580> going<00:04:44.789> to<00:04:44.940> trace<00:04:45.180> all<00:04:45.360> around<00:04:45.690> it

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:45.919 
and you're going to trace all around it

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.580 
and you're going to trace all around it
so<00:04:46.919> this<00:04:47.070> is<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.250> double<00:04:47.840> tracing<00:04:48.840> wheel<00:04:49.020> what<00:04:49.560> I

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
so this is a double tracing wheel what I

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.439 
so this is a double tracing wheel what I
like<00:04:49.860> about<00:04:49.979> it<00:04:50.190> is<00:04:50.310> it<00:04:50.610> marks<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.030> sewing

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
like about it is it marks the sewing

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:53.180 
like about it is it marks the sewing
line<00:04:51.660> and<00:04:52.020> the<00:04:52.199> cutting<00:04:52.530> line<00:04:52.710> at<00:04:52.889> the<00:04:52.979> same

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.190 
line and the cutting line at the same

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.230 
line and the cutting line at the same
time

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
time

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.820 
time
for<00:04:54.510> simplicity's<00:04:55.020> sake<00:04:55.169> I'm<00:04:55.320> just<00:04:55.349> going<00:04:55.710> to

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 
for simplicity's sake I'm just going to

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.930 
for simplicity's sake I'm just going to
take<00:04:56.010> it<00:04:56.039> one<00:04:56.340> wheel<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:58.220> I'm<00:04:59.220> just<00:04:59.460> going<00:04:59.700> to

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
take it one wheel and I'm just going to

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.529 
take it one wheel and I'm just going to
trace<00:05:00.270> very<00:05:00.599> carefully<00:05:01.229> around<00:05:01.740> the<00:05:02.250> edge

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:02.539 
trace very carefully around the edge

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:07.610 
trace very carefully around the edge
just<00:05:03.539> making<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.169> wheel<00:05:04.380> roll<00:05:06.110> right<00:05:07.110> along

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:07.620 
just making the wheel roll right along

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.830 
just making the wheel roll right along
the<00:05:07.830> edge<00:05:08.010> here<00:05:08.610> trying<00:05:09.479> to<00:05:09.570> make<00:05:09.780> sure

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
the edge here trying to make sure

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:23.530 
the edge here trying to make sure
nothing<00:05:10.410> shifts<00:05:10.860> around

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.690 

you<00:05:24.140> might<00:05:24.290> have<00:05:24.440> to<00:05:24.590> go<00:05:24.710> over<00:05:24.980> a<00:05:25.010> couple<00:05:25.280> times

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:25.700 
you might have to go over a couple times

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.290 
you might have to go over a couple times
or<00:05:26.660> press<00:05:26.900> a<00:05:26.930> little<00:05:27.140> bit<00:05:27.380> harder<00:05:27.830> you<00:05:28.300> all

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
or press a little bit harder you all

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.560 
or press a little bit harder you all
eventually<00:05:31.630> find<00:05:32.630> the<00:05:32.930> best<00:05:33.170> way<00:05:33.380> for<00:05:33.650> you<00:05:33.830> and

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:34.570 
eventually find the best way for you and

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.530 
eventually find the best way for you and
what<00:05:35.570> I<00:05:35.600> like<00:05:35.870> to<00:05:35.900> do<00:05:36.080> is<00:05:36.260> also<00:05:36.580> mark<00:05:37.580> the

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
what I like to do is also mark the

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.680 
what I like to do is also mark the
waistline<00:05:39.320> here<00:05:40.330> make<00:05:41.330> sure<00:05:41.480> you're<00:05:41.600> doing

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
waistline here make sure you're doing

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.930 
waistline here make sure you're doing
this<00:05:41.960> on<00:05:42.110> the<00:05:42.620> wrong<00:05:43.280> side<00:05:43.520> of<00:05:43.580> your<00:05:43.700> fabric

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:43.940 
this on the wrong side of your fabric

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.810 
this on the wrong side of your fabric
though<00:05:44.240> so<00:05:44.420> it<00:05:44.540> doesn't<00:05:44.810> show<00:05:46.390> later<00:05:47.390> on<00:05:47.770> and

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
though so it doesn't show later on and

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.340 
though so it doesn't show later on and
I'm<00:05:49.820> not<00:05:50.030> sure<00:05:50.270> if<00:05:50.390> you're<00:05:50.480> able<00:05:50.660> to<00:05:50.900> see<00:05:51.110> that

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:51.350 
I'm not sure if you're able to see that

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.030 
I'm not sure if you're able to see that
but<00:05:51.710> you<00:05:52.040> can<00:05:52.250> see<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.490> very<00:05:52.790> faint<00:05:53.480> and<00:05:54.040> thin

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:55.040 
but you can see a very faint and thin

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.940 
but you can see a very faint and thin
precise<00:05:55.700> outline<00:05:56.630> of<00:05:56.870> your<00:05:57.200> pattern<00:05:57.770> piece

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:57.950 
precise outline of your pattern piece

00:05:57.950 --> 00:06:00.690 
precise outline of your pattern piece
right<00:05:58.250> there<00:05:58.460> so<00:05:59.210> that's<00:05:59.330> how<00:05:59.480> it<00:05:59.690> works

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:00.700 
right there so that's how it works

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.520 
right there so that's how it works
so<00:06:01.700> now<00:06:01.970> let's<00:06:02.150> talk<00:06:02.300> about<00:06:02.360> seam<00:06:02.810> allowance

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.530 
so now let's talk about seam allowance

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.170 
so now let's talk about seam allowance
what<00:06:03.860> seam<00:06:04.070> allowance<00:06:04.460> is<00:06:04.580> it's<00:06:04.820> a<00:06:04.910> little<00:06:05.060> bit

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
what seam allowance is it's a little bit

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.630 
what seam allowance is it's a little bit
of<00:06:05.600> fabric<00:06:06.170> that's<00:06:06.350> left<00:06:06.740> between<00:06:06.980> the<00:06:07.280> sewing

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:07.640 
of fabric that's left between the sewing

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.580 
of fabric that's left between the sewing
line<00:06:07.820> and<00:06:08.090> the<00:06:08.570> edge<00:06:08.720> of<00:06:08.900> your<00:06:08.990> fabric<00:06:09.200> where

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:09.590 
line and the edge of your fabric where

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
line and the edge of your fabric where
you<00:06:09.770> cut<00:06:10.040> and<00:06:10.370> what<00:06:11.180> that<00:06:11.360> is<00:06:11.510> for<00:06:11.780> it<00:06:12.250> it<00:06:13.250> gives

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
you cut and what that is for it it gives

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
you cut and what that is for it it gives
the<00:06:14.170> threads<00:06:15.170> enough<00:06:15.740> fabric<00:06:16.670> to<00:06:16.700> grip<00:06:17.090> when

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
the threads enough fabric to grip when

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.300 
the threads enough fabric to grip when
you're<00:06:17.780> sewing<00:06:18.080> it<00:06:18.170> together<00:06:18.350> so<00:06:18.890> it<00:06:19.040> doesn't

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:19.310 
you're sewing it together so it doesn't

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:21.640 
you're sewing it together so it doesn't
pull<00:06:19.490> out<00:06:19.670> and<00:06:20.000> also<00:06:20.930> if<00:06:21.080> you<00:06:21.230> need<00:06:21.380> to<00:06:21.500> make

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:21.650 
pull out and also if you need to make

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.070 
pull out and also if you need to make
any<00:06:21.830> adjustments<00:06:22.010> in<00:06:22.820> your<00:06:22.880> garments<00:06:23.780> then

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:24.080 
any adjustments in your garments then

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.900 
any adjustments in your garments then
you'll<00:06:24.440> be<00:06:24.650> able<00:06:24.920> to<00:06:25.040> let<00:06:25.220> it<00:06:25.250> out<00:06:25.460> and<00:06:25.790> you'll

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:25.910 
you'll be able to let it out and you'll

00:06:25.910 --> 00:06:29.170 
you'll be able to let it out and you'll
still<00:06:26.150> have<00:06:26.330> enough<00:06:26.600> fabric<00:06:26.990> left<00:06:27.820> so<00:06:28.820> all<00:06:29.060> my

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:29.180 
still have enough fabric left so all my

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:31.900 
still have enough fabric left so all my
pattern<00:06:29.600> pieces<00:06:29.840> for<00:06:30.170> the<00:06:30.260> corset<00:06:30.770> they<00:06:31.580> are

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
pattern pieces for the corset they are

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.510 
pattern pieces for the corset they are
marking<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:32.690> sewing<00:06:33.140> line<00:06:33.380> not<00:06:33.890> the<00:06:33.920> cutting

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
marking the sewing line not the cutting

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.120 
marking the sewing line not the cutting
line<00:06:34.730> and<00:06:35.030> this<00:06:35.570> is<00:06:35.630> important<00:06:36.260> because<00:06:36.320> you

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:37.130 
line and this is important because you

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.950 
line and this is important because you
want<00:06:37.310> to<00:06:37.490> be<00:06:37.610> extremely<00:06:38.120> precise<00:06:38.660> with<00:06:38.930> your

00:06:38.950 --> 00:06:38.960 
want to be extremely precise with your

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.960 
want to be extremely precise with your
sewing<00:06:39.440> lines<00:06:39.650> so<00:06:40.250> when<00:06:41.060> I'm<00:06:41.210> tracing<00:06:41.810> this<00:06:42.140> on

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:42.970 
sewing lines so when I'm tracing this on

00:06:42.970 --> 00:06:45.760 
sewing lines so when I'm tracing this on
on<00:06:43.970> the<00:06:44.180> fabric<00:06:44.630> I<00:06:44.840> don't<00:06:45.230> have<00:06:45.350> my<00:06:45.530> seam

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:45.770 
on the fabric I don't have my seam

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:47.800 
on the fabric I don't have my seam
allowance<00:06:46.220> but<00:06:46.370> what<00:06:46.520> I<00:06:46.550> like<00:06:46.760> to<00:06:46.880> do<00:06:47.060> is<00:06:47.270> use

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
allowance but what I like to do is use

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.450 
allowance but what I like to do is use
the<00:06:48.080> double<00:06:48.440> the<00:06:49.340> double<00:06:50.240> wield<00:06:50.600> tracer<00:06:51.170> and

00:06:51.450 --> 00:06:51.460 
the double the double wield tracer and

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.290 
the double the double wield tracer and
also<00:06:52.460> use<00:06:52.640> the<00:06:52.820> chalk<00:06:53.060> paper<00:06:53.390> and<00:06:53.890> the<00:06:54.890> inner

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:55.300 
also use the chalk paper and the inner

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.060 
also use the chalk paper and the inner
wheel<00:06:56.300> is<00:06:56.570> going<00:06:56.840> to<00:06:56.930> be<00:06:57.200> on<00:06:57.440> the<00:06:57.680> tracing<00:06:58.040> line

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:58.070 
wheel is going to be on the tracing line

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.340 
wheel is going to be on the tracing line
I<00:06:58.340> had<00:06:58.460> just<00:06:58.700> died<00:06:58.880> and<00:06:58.910> the<00:06:59.510> outer<00:06:59.750> wheel<00:07:00.110> is

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:00.350 
I had just died and the outer wheel is

00:07:00.350 --> 00:07:03.700 
I had just died and the outer wheel is
going<00:07:00.590> to<00:07:00.830> mark<00:07:01.220> my<00:07:01.460> cutting<00:07:02.000> line<00:07:02.150> here<00:07:02.710> so

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:03.710 
going to mark my cutting line here so

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:09.450 
going to mark my cutting line here so
what<00:07:03.890> I'm<00:07:04.010> going<00:07:04.340> to<00:07:04.490> get<00:07:04.670> is<00:07:04.910> a<00:07:05.120> very<00:07:05.530> regular

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:09.460 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.990 

seam<00:07:10.460> allowance<00:07:10.970> of<00:07:11.320> I<00:07:12.320> think<00:07:12.650> this<00:07:12.800> is<00:07:13.010> three

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:14.000 
seam allowance of I think this is three

00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.760 
seam allowance of I think this is three
quarters<00:07:14.420> of<00:07:14.540> an<00:07:14.660> inch<00:07:14.750> it's<00:07:15.140> at<00:07:15.380> you<00:07:15.590> right

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:15.770 
quarters of an inch it's at you right

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.000 
quarters of an inch it's at you right
now<00:07:16.420> the<00:07:17.420> awesome<00:07:17.600> thing<00:07:17.960> about<00:07:17.990> this<00:07:18.800> wheel

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:19.010 
now the awesome thing about this wheel

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:20.950 
now the awesome thing about this wheel
is<00:07:19.280> the<00:07:19.310> fact<00:07:19.730> that<00:07:19.820> it's<00:07:20.060> adjustable<00:07:20.330> so<00:07:20.840> you

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 
is the fact that it's adjustable so you

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.160 
is the fact that it's adjustable so you
can<00:07:21.580> increase<00:07:22.580> the<00:07:23.270> distance<00:07:23.720> between<00:07:23.780> the

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.170 
can increase the distance between the

00:07:24.170 --> 00:07:26.500 
can increase the distance between the
wheels<00:07:24.350> by<00:07:24.620> a<00:07:24.650> quarter<00:07:25.100> inch<00:07:25.280> each<00:07:25.490> time<00:07:25.760> so

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:26.510 
wheels by a quarter inch each time so

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:30.040 
wheels by a quarter inch each time so
let<00:07:26.660> me<00:07:26.750> just<00:07:26.930> finish<00:07:27.370> tracing<00:07:28.370> this

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.050 
let me just finish tracing this

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.460 
let me just finish tracing this
okay<00:07:31.009> so<00:07:31.639> now<00:07:32.300> I<00:07:32.660> hope<00:07:32.900> you<00:07:33.050> can<00:07:33.080> see<00:07:33.349> this

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:33.470 
okay so now I hope you can see this

00:07:33.470 --> 00:07:35.290 
okay so now I hope you can see this
again<00:07:33.770> I<00:07:33.800> have<00:07:34.039> no<00:07:34.160> idea<00:07:34.190> this<00:07:34.699> if<00:07:34.910> the<00:07:35.030> camera

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:35.300 
again I have no idea this if the camera

00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:37.570 
again I have no idea this if the camera
is<00:07:35.389> focusing<00:07:35.810> or<00:07:35.960> not<00:07:36.110> but<00:07:36.560> you<00:07:36.680> have<00:07:36.949> your

00:07:37.570 --> 00:07:37.580 
is focusing or not but you have your

00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:40.149 
is focusing or not but you have your
sewing<00:07:38.060> line<00:07:38.270> and<00:07:38.539> also<00:07:39.080> your<00:07:39.560> cutting<00:07:39.979> line

00:07:40.149 --> 00:07:40.159 
sewing line and also your cutting line

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:42.399 
sewing line and also your cutting line
so<00:07:40.759> you're<00:07:41.000> going<00:07:41.300> to<00:07:41.330> cut<00:07:41.659> along<00:07:41.870> this<00:07:42.199> outer

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:42.409 
so you're going to cut along this outer

00:07:42.409 --> 00:07:44.770 
so you're going to cut along this outer
line
