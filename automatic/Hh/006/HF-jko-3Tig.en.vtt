00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.700
 It is possible to say 40 tsubo 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.750
 So far 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:19.430
 Hot is also average in the house where Yamato emanation was made 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:23.990
 And even though I'm such that the most numerous-made housing 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.620
 Well , I think it seems like I want you to think about two things through this time 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.780
 I will 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:33.410
 One is that its 40 tsubo is very average size 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:35.810
 Or it becomes ne or the year is Dattari region 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.970
 There is probably also meaning 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:42.310
 It will change completely and how to live there will also change quite a bit 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:47.140
 I guess i guess 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:48.640
 If be a lot of people are also in one night to will some cases even to live in if you live in the family 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.740
 There may also be 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.790
 That's right 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.030
 By region 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.719
 To come in 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.310
 It does not catch the thing positively in reverse 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.640
 Was thinking Tsunoda of the order was Masumi 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.460
 Then another one is after 3.11 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.590
 Any house 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:12.930
 Live it is never isolated 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.140
 Is good probably a lot of people that say not mean that 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.340
 But I think to have been realized 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.370
 There are probably a lot of ways to connect 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.070
 Is it 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.070
 For example, it may be connected via energy 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:33.300
 Of course through the community 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:37.390
 The Tteyuu such that connection how also there that Tteyuu 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:40.510
 Also, if it even goes captured actively 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.970
 The way of the house itself 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.630
 I think it will change to thinking about that 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.630
 From now on 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:56.990
 Went taken to 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:56.990
 10 ways to have a good way of living if you have
