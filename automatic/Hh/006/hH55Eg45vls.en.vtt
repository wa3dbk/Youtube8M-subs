00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
let's continue going on so we're adding

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.700 
let's continue going on so we're adding
1<00:01:31.160> 2<00:01:32.420> 3<00:01:33.860> 4<00:01:35.000> 5<00:01:36.000> so<00:01:36.390> now<00:01:36.570> that<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.930> understand<00:01:37.530> the

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
1 2 3 4 5 so now that you understand the

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.010 
1 2 3 4 5 so now that you understand the
leg<00:01:37.920> movement<00:01:38.310> let's<00:01:38.880> work<00:01:39.120> on<00:01:39.330> the<00:01:39.480> ability

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
leg movement let's work on the ability

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.590 
leg movement let's work on the ability
to<00:01:40.050> hold<00:01:40.440> your<00:01:40.800> dominoes<00:01:41.280> in<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.850> off<00:01:42.240> the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
to hold your dominoes in and off the

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.100 
to hold your dominoes in and off the
ball

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
ball

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.680 
ball
make<00:01:43.500> this<00:01:43.620> a<00:01:43.680> little<00:01:43.920> more<00:01:44.190> challenging<00:01:44.970> now

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
make this a little more challenging now

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.770 
make this a little more challenging now
let's<00:01:45.990> move<00:01:46.170> the<00:01:46.230> leg<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.860> and<00:01:47.220> now<00:01:48.030> last<00:01:48.420> two

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
let's move the leg in and now last two

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.430 
let's move the leg in and now last two
times<00:01:49.080> so<00:01:49.620> this<00:01:49.770> isn't<00:01:50.070> one<00:01:50.690> two<00:01:52.040> three<00:01:53.270> four

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
times so this isn't one two three four

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.550 
times so this isn't one two three four
five<00:01:55.490> means<00:01:56.490> straight<00:01:57.210> out<00:01:57.420> last<00:01:57.780> time<00:01:58.170> here

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
five means straight out last time here

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.510 
five means straight out last time here
we<00:01:58.710> go<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.700> two<00:02:00.620> so<00:02:01.620> we<00:02:01.770> are<00:02:01.950> toning<00:02:02.400> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
we go and one two so we are toning the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.810 
we go and one two so we are toning the
gluteals<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.420> backs<00:02:03.659> of<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.050> legs<00:02:04.229> and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:04.820 
gluteals the backs of the legs and

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.750 
gluteals the backs of the legs and
moving<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:06.000> so<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:06.840> here<00:02:07.229> let's<00:02:07.740> walk<00:02:08.519> your

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760 
moving on so from here let's walk your

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.850 
moving on so from here let's walk your
hands<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.060> little<00:02:09.179> further<00:02:09.570> away<00:02:09.840> lift<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
hands a little further away lift the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
hands a little further away lift the
legs<00:02:11.070> off<00:02:11.340> the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
legs off the

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.470 
legs off the
and<00:02:12.120> move<00:02:12.300> to<00:02:12.510> swimming<00:02:13.050> so<00:02:13.290> we<00:02:13.440> enhance<00:02:14.480> ax

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
and move to swimming so we enhance ax

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.110 
and move to swimming so we enhance ax
fell<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.140> swimming<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:16.920> movement<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.880> legs

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
fell so swimming is movement of the legs

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.870 
fell so swimming is movement of the legs
core<00:02:18.900> stability<00:02:19.230> otherwise<00:02:19.980> you're<00:02:20.250> rolling

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
core stability otherwise you're rolling

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.760 
core stability otherwise you're rolling
all<00:02:21.120> over<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.510> ball<00:02:21.720> two<00:02:22.380> more<00:02:22.620> times<00:02:22.920> inhale

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
all over the ball two more times inhale

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.830 
all over the ball two more times inhale
excess<00:02:25.970> one<00:02:26.970> more<00:02:27.240> time<00:02:27.510> inhaling<00:02:29.540> exhale<00:02:30.540> now

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
excess one more time inhaling exhale now

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.080 
excess one more time inhaling exhale now
that<00:02:31.110> we<00:02:31.230> finished<00:02:31.620> swimming<00:02:32.100> roll<00:02:32.490> back

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090
