00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 it was how to make a trap but 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.290
 the animal or making to start with the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.530
 demonstration 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:17.850
 this does not require this is the leg of 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:19.949
 the animal to the beast has decoined it 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.580
 wants to escape low she can not because 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.650
 that it serves to make more and more use 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.240
 the beauty of the feet 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.439
 now i will explain to you 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:34.469
 how to trap 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:38.570
 first you need they are worn 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.570
 fire sewers 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:52.070
 the court blames that I want to unify the 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:55.930
 victims at his expense 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:59.270
 we are for the size of our 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:02.050
 plug in the criticism 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.050
 pretty much everywhere 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:16.900
 you need two boats like this 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:20.780
 so it looks a bit like stalling 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.380
 three sticks to his rights so like 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.760
 these third I'm here it's 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.229
 for us to plant 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:33.350
 by the way, you take both 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:39.830
 boats hang you plant them in 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:42.070
 the only blaise the plants well and for 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.070
 whatever 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:55.109
 you are celebrating the distance of your boat 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.109
 that's it 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:59.610
 after the 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.349
 knowing 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:27.550
 Most important 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.040
 look how I do you 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:44.519
 go two ways there the most 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.519
 big biggest on sale 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.240
 You put 

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:03.650
 look good you keep it at home 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:06.480
 with this engine is there it should hold 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.000
 then to fissel had to be careful 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:17.820
 that it goes underneath and not at 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:21.510
 on it and exposes you as concerns and 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:24.870
 weigh yourself like this you can put 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.520
 seeds or a little bit and is a little bit of 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.090
 rice because because it attracts them doing 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.470
 they are drawn by the night 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.420
 we will do the demonstration with 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.200
 a trap but it's exactly the same 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.630
 than it was earlier except that I 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.010
 not put a stick here I had a little 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.950
 board to have more chances 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:48.770
 to catch the animal and I also put 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:50.900
 seeds so the top a little side 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.510
 animal walks on the board 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:04:01.500
 I'm just demonstrating 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:04.040
 look at the worry is the mop and ben 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 stuck
