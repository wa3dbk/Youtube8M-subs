00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
just like this where I grew up with two

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.830 
just like this where I grew up with two
fingers<00:01:15.070> right<00:01:15.220> here<00:01:15.520> on<00:01:15.610> the<00:01:15.700> side<00:01:15.910> and<00:01:16.210> goes

fingers right here on the side and goes

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.980 
fingers right here on the side and goes
over<00:01:17.140> there<00:01:17.290> okay<00:01:17.800> and<00:01:17.950> then<00:01:18.520> it<00:01:19.180> has<00:01:19.450> a<00:01:19.480> let's

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
over there okay and then it has a let's

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.020 
over there okay and then it has a let's
say<00:01:20.080> a<00:01:20.110> metal<00:01:20.290> back<00:01:20.590> here<00:01:20.980> and<00:01:21.160> I'll<00:01:21.760> just<00:01:21.910> show

here and that would basically tell the

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.440 
here and that would basically tell the
computer<00:01:56.350> that<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.770> know<00:01:56.890> don't<00:01:57.400> you<00:01:57.820> know<00:01:58.150> to

take a look at the at the control panel
here<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.170> here<00:02:08.920> we<00:02:08.979> are<00:02:09.009> in<00:02:09.220> the<00:02:09.280> control<00:02:09.519> panel

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
here so here we are in the control panel

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.250 
here so here we are in the control panel
and<00:02:09.909> here's<00:02:10.119> some<00:02:10.239> of<00:02:10.360> your<00:02:10.479> options<00:02:10.599> you<00:02:11.140> have

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
tracking this will tell you how fast to

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:14.789 
tracking this will tell you how fast to
Mouse<00:02:13.000> track<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.690> moving<00:02:13.959> and<00:02:14.080> around<00:02:14.319> it

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:14.799 
Mouse track just moving and around it

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:16.199 
Mouse track just moving and around it
seems<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.099> little<00:02:15.220> slow<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.519> me<00:02:15.700> so<00:02:15.849> I<00:02:15.909> cranked

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:16.209 
seems a little slow to me so I cranked

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.640 
seems a little slow to me so I cranked
it<00:02:16.240> all<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.510> way<00:02:16.600> up<00:02:16.630> the<00:02:16.959> scrolling<00:02:17.260> this<00:02:17.530> is

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
it until it reaches the edge or you know

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.000 
it until it reaches the edge or you know
whatever<00:03:17.000> options<00:03:17.510> you<00:03:17.630> got<00:03:17.810> there<00:03:18.050> and<00:03:18.860> then

have it swipe and go back just a little

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.520 
have it swipe and go back just a little
time-saving<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.269> lastly<00:03:33.049> here<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.380> get<00:03:33.470> a

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
pretty big trackpad basically to work

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.349 
pretty big trackpad basically to work
with<00:04:06.650> here<00:04:06.890> and<00:04:07.250> let's<00:04:07.880> not<00:04:08.060> let's<00:04:08.209> take<00:04:08.269> a

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:08.359 
with here and let's not let's take a

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:10.240 
with here and let's not let's take a
look<00:04:08.600> at<00:04:08.750> the<00:04:08.870> momentum<00:04:09.410> this<00:04:09.590> is<00:04:09.769> swipe<00:04:10.010> with

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
look at the momentum this is swipe with

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.000 
look at the momentum this is swipe with
momentum<00:04:10.850> so<00:04:11.480> we<00:04:12.230> will<00:04:12.440> just<00:04:12.620> give<00:04:12.890> it<00:04:12.950> a

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
momentum so we will just give it a

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.410 
momentum so we will just give it a
little<00:04:13.190> flick<00:04:13.430> and<00:04:13.730> you<00:04:13.820> can<00:04:13.970> see<00:04:14.090> it<00:04:14.209> kind<00:04:14.390> of

little flick and you can see it kind of
keeps<00:04:14.570> going<00:04:15.019> or<00:04:15.440> it<00:04:15.650> could<00:04:15.769> go<00:04:15.829> real<00:04:16.039> fast<00:04:16.310> so

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
keeps going or it could go real fast so

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.520 
keeps going or it could go real fast so
you<00:04:17.120> just<00:04:17.299> take<00:04:17.510> your<00:04:17.660> finger<00:04:17.959> off<00:04:17.989> just<00:04:18.410> kind

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
you just take your finger off just kind

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.159 
you just take your finger off just kind
of<00:04:18.650> flick<00:04:18.859> it<00:04:19.010> and<00:04:19.750> there<00:04:20.750> it<00:04:20.810> goes<00:04:20.840> and

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:21.169 
of flick it and there it goes and

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.020 
of flick it and there it goes and
depending<00:04:21.560> how<00:04:21.590> how<00:04:22.039> hard<00:04:22.310> you<00:04:22.460> do<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.700> will<00:04:22.880> be

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
depending how how hard you do it will be

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:24.760 
depending how how hard you do it will be
how<00:04:23.120> fast<00:04:23.419> it<00:04:23.600> goes<00:04:23.750> so<00:04:24.229> there<00:04:24.380> we<00:04:24.470> go<00:04:24.560> all<00:04:24.710> the

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
how fast it goes so there we go all the

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.590 
how fast it goes so there we go all the
way<00:04:24.800> at<00:04:25.010> top<00:04:25.190> all<00:04:25.490> the<00:04:25.520> way<00:04:25.580> to<00:04:25.700> the<00:04:25.789> bottom<00:04:25.940> or

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
way at top all the way to the bottom or

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.240 
way at top all the way to the bottom or
we<00:04:26.750> just<00:04:26.900> do<00:04:26.990> a<00:04:27.020> little<00:04:27.169> bit<00:04:27.320> you<00:04:27.950> know<00:04:28.039> those

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
we just do a little bit you know those

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.890 
we just do a little bit you know those
there<00:04:28.520> you<00:04:28.760> know<00:04:28.850> so<00:04:28.970> it's<00:04:29.180> it's<00:04:29.419> really

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
there you know so it's it's really

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.600 
there you know so it's it's really
intuitive<00:04:30.200> and<00:04:30.560> this<00:04:30.979> is<00:04:31.130> a<00:04:31.159> you<00:04:31.400> know<00:04:31.430> this<00:04:31.520> is

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
intuitive and this is a you know this is

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.920 
intuitive and this is a you know this is
pretty<00:04:31.789> cool<00:04:31.970> on<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.150> iphone<00:04:32.479> and<00:04:32.630> ipod<00:04:32.870> touch

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
pretty cool on the iphone and ipod touch

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.999 
pretty cool on the iphone and ipod touch
and<00:04:33.229> if<00:04:33.320> you<00:04:33.409> have<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.680> you

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:34.009 
and if you have that you

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:36.029 
and if you have that you
probably<00:04:34.279> very<00:04:34.460> very<00:04:34.580> familiar<00:04:35.360> with<00:04:35.389> it

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:36.039 
probably very very familiar with it

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.170 
probably very very familiar with it
let's<00:04:37.039> do<00:04:37.159> the<00:04:37.189> two<00:04:37.430> finger<00:04:37.699> swipe<00:04:37.849> and

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:38.180 
let's do the two finger swipe and

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.129 
let's do the two finger swipe and
basically<00:04:38.449> you<00:04:38.509> want<00:04:38.629> to<00:04:38.689> make<00:04:38.809> sure<00:04:38.839> your

00:04:39.129 --> 00:04:39.139 
basically you want to make sure your

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:40.929 
basically you want to make sure your
fingers<00:04:39.289> are<00:04:39.710> not<00:04:39.919> right<00:04:40.189> together<00:04:40.550> so<00:04:40.789> just

00:04:40.929 --> 00:04:40.939 
fingers are not right together so just

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:42.279 
fingers are not right together so just
have<00:04:41.089> a<00:04:41.119> little<00:04:41.360> separation<00:04:41.719> between<00:04:41.960> them

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289 
have a little separation between them

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.489 
have a little separation between them
and<00:04:42.439> so<00:04:43.309> we'll<00:04:43.460> go<00:04:43.580> forward<00:04:43.909> and<00:04:44.869> there<00:04:45.259> we<00:04:45.379> go

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:45.499 
and so we'll go forward and there we go

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:47.980 
and so we'll go forward and there we go
and<00:04:45.710> now<00:04:46.189> we'll<00:04:46.369> go<00:04:46.490> backwards<00:04:46.789> and<00:04:47.149> there<00:04:47.869> we

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
and now we'll go backwards and there we

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:50.079 
and now we'll go backwards and there we
go<00:04:48.110> so<00:04:48.619> that's<00:04:49.309> how<00:04:49.399> that<00:04:49.460> works<00:04:49.669> and<00:04:49.909> again

00:04:50.079 --> 00:04:50.089 
go so that's how that works and again

00:04:50.089 --> 00:04:51.429 
go so that's how that works and again
this<00:04:50.270> kind<00:04:50.479> of<00:04:50.569> saves<00:04:50.749> you<00:04:50.869> from<00:04:50.990> having<00:04:51.080> to<00:04:51.319> go

00:04:51.429 --> 00:04:51.439 
this kind of saves you from having to go

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.989 
this kind of saves you from having to go
back<00:04:51.589> up<00:04:51.770> here<00:04:51.800> right<00:04:52.219> clicking<00:04:52.639> just<00:04:52.759> kind<00:04:52.969> of

00:04:52.989 --> 00:04:52.999 
back up here right clicking just kind of

similar<00:06:19.580> stuff<00:06:19.699> with<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.240> iPhone<00:06:20.599> and<00:06:20.809> iPod
