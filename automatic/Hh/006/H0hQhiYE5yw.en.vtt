00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.100
 terrestrial rice environments 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.720
 they also present some factors that 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.180
 facilitate the development of life and 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.190
 others that the main difficulties 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:25.580
 factors are compared with the 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.040
 aquatic environments the following minor 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.160
 greater water availability 

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:36.280
 oxygen availability lower density 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:40.640
 the less dense air with greater water does not 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.980
 luminosity greater technical variation for 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.260
 survive under these conditions the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.380
 organisms present adaptations for 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.840
 conserve water stay upright to 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.210
 despite the gravity to capture sunlight 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.800
 and endure the abrupt changes of 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.750
 temperature 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.410
 these factors vary in each of the 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 environments 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
 air-ground environments are 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.489
 classified according to vegetation 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.520
 predominant plant life is a 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:12.210
 reflection of soil climate and relief 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 so different biomes are distinguished 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.119
 grasslands forests jungles the 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:22.140
 high mountains the savannahs the deserts 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.610
 the tundra and the polar ice on the 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.320
 next map you can observe the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.750
 distribution of the biomes in our 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.070
 planet and in our country the entities 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.410
 presents a wide variety of languages 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.360
 due mainly to the different 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.399
 climates to which you are placed 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.350
 I reread temperature the rains 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.500
 plentiful up to two thousand milliliters 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.229
 annual and high humidity make 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.990
 the availability of water in the cell 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.979
 is not a limiting factor but because 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.190
 the opposite allows the development of 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.399
 an exuberant vegetation more than 2,000 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.670
 different species of plants coexist 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:59.740
 in her 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:01.659
 this great diversity of vegetation 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.390
 generates microenvironment where they can 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.850
 inhabit many animal species of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.380
 the most diverse groups in a single tree 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.360
 of the cell can be found 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.780
 individuals of up to 400 species 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:16.720
 different from insects however if you 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.780
 establishes extensive competition for 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.840
 light as the vegetation forms a frame 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.750
 closed that does not allow its arrival at 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.410
 soil the plants are arranged in 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:31.600
 different fields and they are called strata 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.510
 in the upper strata the vegetation 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.239
 presents adaptations to avoid 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.720
 Water loss due to intense 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:44.920
 solar radiation some leaves have a 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:48.850
 thick cuticle other things with change 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:53.019
 its origin its orientation during the day 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:56.860
 not directly receive the light of 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:03:00.760
 targets and the vines climb the 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.900
 trunks of the trees to reach the 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.180
 light 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.129
 in the middle portraits the layers of the 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:09.470
 tall trees form a vault to the 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:12.680
 squeeze in your competition for light 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:14.450
 below the fingering forms a single 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.840
 level to avoid shadows 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.600
 mutually to the lower part arrives 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:22.730
 very little light some plants present 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:26.120
 very large leaves to capture the most 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.340
 possible quantity the reddish soil rich in 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.500
 iron is upholstered with moss and 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.210
 lichen and covered by leaves in the 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.820
 compositions that provide nutrients 

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:37.010
 needed for many plants 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:39.920
 roots are superficial and extended 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.930
 later to take advantage of them 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.380
 In addition, relationships are established 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:48.800
 symbiotics between certain mushrooms and 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.350
 Mycorrhizal roots that improve the 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.170
 the absorption of nutrients 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:56.810
 pollination pollen transport of the 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.140
 flower from one plant to the other plant 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.810
 of the same species and the dispersion of 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.420
 the fruits and the seeds are made 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.550
 mainly by animals 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.830
 interactions between plants and 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.470
 animals in this area are very 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.360
 developed each one is a certain 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:18.209
 located more than 3,500 meters high 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:20.400
 like all desert is characterized by the 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:24.060
 great shortage of water and by the great 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.330
 Thermal amplitude that can be more than 20 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:31.250
 degrees between the day the solar radiation 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:35.130
 It is intense and the night can produce more 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:37.740
 the soil poor in nutrients is 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:40.650
 formed by stones and sand product of 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.630
 the disintegration of the rocks some 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.030
 plants have roots that lead to 

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:47.340
 30 meters deep to reach 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.800
 one layer of water and others have roots 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:52.020
 superficial and extensive to take advantage of 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.630
 The thin superficial layer of matter 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:56.790
 organic solar radiation is 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.440
 generally very high of some plants 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:00.570
 and they are covered by white hairs for 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.760
 reflect and reduce water loss 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:04.860
 the organisms of the certain present 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.470
 adaptations that allows them to survive 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.510
 under extreme conditions the animals 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.910
 They also have different strategies for 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:14.340
 survive in the certain some put 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:16.440
 eggs that are very resistant to drying 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.030
 they usually survive for years until 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.280
 give the conditions of humidity that 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.840
 allow their development are the 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.150
 observers keeps 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.430
 reduced populations and only occur 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:29.040
 after the rainfall when 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.229
 vegetation grows many animals of the 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:33.650
 desert take refuge in burrows of 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.820
 which at certain times of the day 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:39.030
 especially at dawn and the 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:41.010
 twilight so avoid the big 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:43.979
 diurnal heats and the extreme folios of 

00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:45.720
 the night a forest is a set of 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.280
 trees but unlike the jungles 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:49.260
 there are no lianas in the Andean forest 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.419
 Patagonia the winters are very cold 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:53.340
 big snowfall and important frosts 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:55.620
 they make this mind a desert 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:58.410
 filled during this season as the 

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.479
 roots can not make ice because of 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:06:02.430
 the low temperatures while jealousy 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:04.200
 the matter is rich in nutrients 

00:06:02.430 --> 00:06:06.450
 organic from which they are formed 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:09.090
 they decompose slowly here 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:11.760
 we found trees that resist very 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:14.820
 well the winter cold like the wii and the 

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:18.120
 lenga others have cone shape for 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:20.520
 that the snow does not accumulate in them and 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.960
 leaves that in sheet form to 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.470
 reduce it 

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:27.660
 of water like conifers plus many 

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:29.130
 plants of this forest possess in their 

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:31.650
 Leaves substances with flavors 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.849
 unpleasant to herbivores not the 

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:38.340
 eat between the way we find 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:42.120
 different species of mammals like the 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:44.370
 egg the huemul the pudu and the fox 

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.979
 colorado since having the body 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:50.190
 covered with hair can support the 

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:53.069
 low temperatures the pampas pasture 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:55.680
 it is a plain existence covered by 

00:06:53.069 --> 00:06:58.080
 herbs that develops on a soil 

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.470
 fertile and under a first wet tempering 

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:04.590
 to its wet in this language the vegetation 

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:06.020
 is exposed to strong winds in the 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.400
 jungle are already growing and reproducing 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:10.830
 quickly so they earn the 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.560
 competition with trees whose 

00:07:10.830 --> 00:07:15.150
 development is much slower besides 

00:07:13.560 --> 00:07:17.340
 everything was a strong wind since they are 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:20.490
 flexible unlike trees 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:22.830
 young people who break in this language 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:25.949
 there are no native trees what can be 

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:28.330
 observe were introduced by the 

00:07:25.949 --> 00:07:31.120
 man come from other biomes 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:32.979
 like the stupid vegetation the 

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:35.590
 pasture animals possess 

00:07:32.979 --> 00:07:38.229
 adaptations so as not to be easily 

00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.909
 seen by predators 

00:07:38.229 --> 00:07:42.669
 many of these adaptations are from 

00:07:39.909 --> 00:07:45.370
 behavior some some run 

00:07:42.669 --> 00:07:48.280
 quickly combining others or together 

00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:49.990
 united between the grass like the teros and 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:52.240
 others remain hidden in their 

00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:56.669
 burrow during the day and leave by the 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.669
 night like many rodents 

00:08:03.789 --> 00:08:06.789
 and
