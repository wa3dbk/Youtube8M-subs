00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
definitely make it work
as<00:02:21.879> far<00:02:22.180> as<00:02:22.209> coverage<00:02:22.750> goes<00:02:23.019> it's<00:02:23.560> not

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
as far as coverage goes it's not

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.699 
as far as coverage goes it's not
covering<00:02:26.440> much<00:02:27.329> hmm<00:02:28.329> I<00:02:28.450> don't<00:02:29.319> know<00:02:29.410> if<00:02:29.500> that's

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
covering much hmm I don't know if that's

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.710 
covering much hmm I don't know if that's
even<00:02:29.890> medium<00:02:30.519> coverage<00:02:30.879> at<00:02:31.060> this<00:02:31.209> point<00:02:31.510> I

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
even medium coverage at this point I

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.850 
even medium coverage at this point I
mean<00:02:31.870> it<00:02:31.989> would<00:02:32.110> cover<00:02:32.319> any<00:02:32.590> like<00:02:32.860> minor<00:02:33.099> minor

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
mean it would cover any like minor minor

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.500 
mean it would cover any like minor minor
dark<00:02:35.860> spots<00:02:36.099> that<00:02:36.220> I<00:02:36.310> had<00:02:36.489> up<00:02:36.610> with<00:02:36.790> this<00:02:37.030> bad

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
dark spots that I had up with this bad

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.630 
dark spots that I had up with this bad
boy<00:02:37.540> here<00:02:38.200> it's<00:02:38.560> friend

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
boy here it's friend

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.880 
boy here it's friend
it<00:02:40.239> hasn't<00:02:40.840> covered<00:02:41.319> those<00:02:42.720> um<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.780> guess<00:02:44.650> it's

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
it hasn't covered those um I guess it's

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:46.890 
it hasn't covered those um I guess it's
even<00:02:45.310> down<00:02:45.489> my<00:02:45.700> skin<00:02:46.030> tone<00:02:46.209> I<00:02:46.450> was<00:02:46.629> saying

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
even down my skin tone I was saying

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.690 
even down my skin tone I was saying
let's<00:02:47.349> see<00:02:47.560> how<00:02:47.739> it<00:02:47.920> goes<00:02:48.129> when<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.430> apply

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
let's see how it goes when I apply

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.699 
let's see how it goes when I apply
another<00:02:49.090> layer<00:02:49.209> just<00:02:49.690> to<00:02:49.810> see<00:02:50.079> how<00:02:50.260> buildable

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:50.709 
another layer just to see how buildable

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:59.800 
another layer just to see how buildable
it<00:02:51.129> actually<00:02:51.670> is

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.890 

okay

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
okay

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.949 
okay
so<00:03:02.440> here's<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.799> second<00:03:03.670> layer<00:03:04.030> I'd<00:03:04.599> say<00:03:04.810> it's

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:04.959 
so here's a second layer I'd say it's

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:06.000 
so here's a second layer I'd say it's
buildable

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
buildable

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.899 
buildable
let's<00:03:06.659> I'm<00:03:07.659> going<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.049> do<00:03:08.230> the<00:03:08.440> other<00:03:08.799> side<00:03:09.370> and

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:09.909 
let's I'm going to do the other side and

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.119 
let's I'm going to do the other side and
then<00:03:10.260> we'll<00:03:11.260> see<00:03:11.530> how<00:03:11.920> it<00:03:12.819> goes<00:03:12.849> so<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.629> is

00:03:14.119 --> 00:03:14.129 
then we'll see how it goes so this is

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:16.490 
then we'll see how it goes so this is
one<00:03:15.129> pump<00:03:15.370> of<00:03:15.489> the<00:03:15.580> foundation<00:03:16.120> applied

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
one pump of the foundation applied

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.119 
one pump of the foundation applied
pretty<00:03:17.500> evenly<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.129> my<00:03:18.280> face<00:03:18.610> I<00:03:19.060> think<00:03:19.450> it

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
pretty evenly to my face I think it

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.809 
pretty evenly to my face I think it
evened<00:03:21.129> out<00:03:21.220> my<00:03:21.430> skin<00:03:21.819> tone<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:22.480> lot<00:03:23.400> but<00:03:24.400> as<00:03:24.579> far

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
evened out my skin tone a lot but as far

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.270 
evened out my skin tone a lot but as far
as<00:03:24.849> like<00:03:25.090> coverage<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:26.170> don't<00:03:26.680> know<00:03:26.890> if<00:03:27.010> it<00:03:27.129> has

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
as like coverage I don't know if it has

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.000 
as like coverage I don't know if it has
the<00:03:27.430> coverage<00:03:27.730> of<00:03:27.879> a<00:03:28.000> concealer<00:03:28.540> because<00:03:29.010> I

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
the coverage of a concealer because I

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.030 
the coverage of a concealer because I
can<00:03:30.730> still<00:03:30.940> see<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.930> acne<00:03:32.349> scars<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.680> I<00:03:32.799> have

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
can still see the acne scars that I have

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.789 
can still see the acne scars that I have
that<00:03:33.220> are<00:03:33.400> the<00:03:33.700> darkest<00:03:34.349> you<00:03:35.349> want<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.650> put

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
that are the darkest you want to put

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:40.559 
that are the darkest you want to put
some<00:03:36.010> more<00:03:36.250> on<00:03:38.430> the<00:03:39.430> dark<00:03:39.700> spots<00:03:39.970> I<00:03:40.150> have<00:03:40.329> and

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
some more on the dark spots I have and

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:41.910 
some more on the dark spots I have and
see<00:03:40.780> if<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.019> actually<00:03:41.200> does<00:03:41.530> have<00:03:41.739> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
see if it actually does have the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.250 
see if it actually does have the
coverage<00:03:42.220> of<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.489> concealer<00:03:43.000> because<00:03:43.239> I<00:03:43.870> want

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
coverage of a concealer because I want

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:58.820 
coverage of a concealer because I want
to<00:03:44.379> know

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.910 

so<00:03:59.430> I've<00:03:59.880> gone<00:04:00.090> back<00:04:00.390> and<00:04:00.810> covered<00:04:01.200> up<00:04:01.320> tried

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
so I've gone back and covered up tried

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.370 
so I've gone back and covered up tried
to<00:04:02.070> cover<00:04:02.310> up<00:04:02.460> specifically<00:04:03.090> like<00:04:03.960> any<00:04:04.170> dark

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
to cover up specifically like any dark

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.990 
to cover up specifically like any dark
spots<00:04:04.530> that<00:04:04.800> I<00:04:04.860> have<00:04:05.070> and<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.370> think<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.790> did<00:04:05.970> a

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
spots that I have and I think it did a

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.150 
spots that I have and I think it did a
much<00:04:06.240> better<00:04:06.270> job<00:04:06.540> once<00:04:07.140> you<00:04:07.320> go<00:04:07.500> in<00:04:07.710> with<00:04:07.980> an

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
much better job once you go in with an

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:11.210 
much better job once you go in with an
actual<00:04:08.750> maybe<00:04:09.750> concealer<00:04:10.290> brush<00:04:10.500> and<00:04:10.740> like<00:04:10.980> do

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
actual maybe concealer brush and like do

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:14.330 
actual maybe concealer brush and like do
some<00:04:11.460> spot<00:04:11.910> concealing<00:04:12.750> it<00:04:13.680> still<00:04:14.100> didn't

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
some spot concealing it still didn't

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.550 
some spot concealing it still didn't
cover<00:04:14.550> the<00:04:15.000> one<00:04:15.210> that's<00:04:15.390> on<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.660> chin<00:04:16.110> here<00:04:16.380> the

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
cover the one that's on my chin here the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.470 
cover the one that's on my chin here the
most<00:04:16.830> but<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.280> one's<00:04:17.430> pretty<00:04:17.670> dark<00:04:18.000> it's<00:04:18.269> a

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
most but that one's pretty dark it's a

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.420 
most but that one's pretty dark it's a

touching up blotting or anything like
that<00:04:43.080> which<00:04:43.410> is<00:04:43.530> pretty<00:04:43.740> scary<00:04:44.100> because<00:04:44.370> I

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
that which is pretty scary because I

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.850 
that which is pretty scary because I
could<00:04:45.150> look<00:04:45.330> like<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.810> greaseball<00:04:46.380> by<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.650> end

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
could look like a greaseball by the end

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.270 
could look like a greaseball by the end
of<00:04:46.920> the<00:04:47.010> day<00:04:48.260> currently<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.500> is<00:04:51.470> 1156<00:04:52.470> if<00:04:53.160> you

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.620 
can see that there I'll check back in a
couple<00:04:56.160> of<00:04:56.340> hours<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:57.000> let<00:04:57.120> you<00:04:57.240> know<00:04:57.390> how

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:57.630 
couple of hours to let you know how

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:59.930 
couple of hours to let you know how
things<00:04:57.870> are<00:04:58.020> going

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
things are going

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.010 
things are going
hey<00:05:00.750> guys<00:05:00.990> I'm<00:05:01.290> back<00:05:01.320> and<00:05:01.800> it<00:05:02.370> is<00:05:02.550> now<00:05:03.020> five

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.830 
hey guys I'm back and it is now five
o'clock<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:05.400> it's<00:05:05.790> been<00:05:06.180> about<00:05:07.580> what<00:05:08.840> six

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:09.840 
o'clock so it's been about what six

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.870 
o'clock so it's been about what six
hours<00:05:10.050> I<00:05:10.650> think<00:05:10.800> since<00:05:11.340> I<00:05:11.460> applied<00:05:11.730> the

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:11.880 
hours I think since I applied the

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.710 
hours I think since I applied the
foundation<00:05:12.860> and<00:05:13.860> I<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.670> not<00:05:14.880> touched<00:05:15.090> it<00:05:15.420> I

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:15.720 
foundation and I have not touched it I

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:17.750 
foundation and I have not touched it I
didn't<00:05:16.230> blot<00:05:16.470> I<00:05:16.800> didn't<00:05:17.190> set<00:05:17.490> it<00:05:17.520> with

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
didn't blot I didn't set it with

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.020 
didn't blot I didn't set it with
anything<00:05:18.300> and<00:05:18.630> I<00:05:19.380> think<00:05:20.160> that<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.580> actually

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
anything and I think that it actually

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.850 
anything and I think that it actually
looks<00:05:21.360> pretty<00:05:21.920> decent<00:05:22.920> but<00:05:23.850> to<00:05:24.690> me<00:05:24.930> having

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
looks pretty decent but to me having

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:28.130 
looks pretty decent but to me having
combination<00:05:26.730> oily<00:05:26.850> skin<00:05:27.180> I<00:05:27.300> get<00:05:27.480> like<00:05:27.660> really

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
combination oily skin I get like really

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:32.120 
combination oily skin I get like really
oily<00:05:28.610> my<00:05:29.610> chin<00:05:29.940> right<00:05:30.510> around<00:05:30.750> here<00:05:31.200> and<00:05:31.380> right

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.130 
oily my chin right around here and right

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.040 
oily my chin right around here and right
here<00:05:32.370> in<00:05:32.460> my<00:05:32.610> forehead<00:05:32.970> I<00:05:33.240> think<00:05:33.540> it<00:05:33.660> held<00:05:33.870> up

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:34.050 
here in my forehead I think it held up

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:36.110 
here in my forehead I think it held up
pretty<00:05:34.230> well<00:05:34.380> for<00:05:34.740> me<00:05:34.890> not<00:05:35.220> to<00:05:35.520> have<00:05:35.700> said<00:05:35.970> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
pretty well for me not to have said it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.050 
pretty well for me not to have said it
at<00:05:36.270> all<00:05:36.510> I<00:05:36.750> didn't<00:05:37.710> use<00:05:37.860> any<00:05:38.160> type<00:05:38.340> of<00:05:38.520> primer<00:05:38.880> I

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:39.060 
at all I didn't use any type of primer I

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.600 
at all I didn't use any type of primer I
didn't<00:05:39.480> use<00:05:39.750> any<00:05:40.470> type<00:05:40.710> of<00:05:40.740> oil<00:05:41.160> control

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
didn't use any type of oil control

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.820 
didn't use any type of oil control
lotion<00:05:42.120> so<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.540> think<00:05:42.810> it<00:05:43.170> held<00:05:43.350> up<00:05:43.560> pretty<00:05:43.680> well

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
lotion so I think it held up pretty well

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.250 
lotion so I think it held up pretty well
in<00:05:44.100> its<00:05:44.250> own<00:05:44.370> I<00:05:44.610> can<00:05:44.790> imagine<00:05:45.030> had<00:05:45.540> I<00:05:45.690> said<00:05:46.080> it

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
in its own I can imagine had I said it

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:48.620 
in its own I can imagine had I said it
or<00:05:46.410> use<00:05:46.590> any<00:05:46.770> of<00:05:46.920> those<00:05:47.040> products<00:05:47.580> that<00:05:47.730> it

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
or use any of those products that it

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:52.670 
or use any of those products that it
would<00:05:48.900> look<00:05:49.080> even<00:05:49.380> better<00:05:50.010> as<00:05:50.910> far<00:05:51.300> as<00:05:51.680> the

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
would look even better as far as the

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:54.950 
would look even better as far as the
color<00:05:53.130> I<00:05:53.520> think<00:05:53.820> I<00:05:54.090> was<00:05:54.180> able<00:05:54.300> to<00:05:54.450> make<00:05:54.660> it<00:05:54.690> work

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
color I think I was able to make it work

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:56.660 
color I think I was able to make it work
I<00:05:55.200> just<00:05:55.230> added<00:05:55.530> like<00:05:55.800> some<00:05:56.010> powder<00:05:56.220> down<00:05:56.430> here

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:56.670 
I just added like some powder down here

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:59.300 
I just added like some powder down here
to<00:05:56.820> kind<00:05:57.060> of<00:05:57.380> match<00:05:58.380> it<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.770> little<00:05:58.980> bit<00:05:59.130> better

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
to kind of match it a little bit better

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.020 
to kind of match it a little bit better
but<00:05:59.520> I<00:05:59.610> don't

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.030 
but I don't

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.180 
but I don't
that's<00:06:00.240> my<00:06:00.420> only<00:06:00.780> gripe<00:06:01.020> is<00:06:01.350> that<00:06:01.680> um<00:06:01.980> the

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:02.190 
that's my only gripe is that um the

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:03.920 
that's my only gripe is that um the
color<00:06:02.430> for<00:06:02.670> me<00:06:02.850> I<00:06:02.880> don't<00:06:03.300> think<00:06:03.360> was<00:06:03.630> like<00:06:03.750> you

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:03.930 
color for me I don't think was like you

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:05.810 
color for me I don't think was like you
know<00:06:04.020> the<00:06:04.320> match<00:06:04.620> that<00:06:04.890> I<00:06:04.920> wanted<00:06:05.400> it<00:06:05.520> to<00:06:05.670> be

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:05.820 
know the match that I wanted it to be

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:07.640 
know the match that I wanted it to be
but<00:06:06.060> I<00:06:06.090> could<00:06:06.330> make<00:06:06.480> it<00:06:06.630> work<00:06:06.840> I<00:06:07.050> think<00:06:07.440> it's

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
but I could make it work I think it's

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:11.450 
but I could make it work I think it's
really<00:06:08.580> a<00:06:09.030> nice<00:06:09.870> foundation<00:06:10.530> for<00:06:11.190> a<00:06:11.220> drugstore
