hi<00:00:22.170> this<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.440> Akshay<00:00:22.860> somebody<00:00:23.250> from<00:00:23.520> Team<00:00:23.760> bhp

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:24.270 
hi this is Akshay somebody from Team bhp

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:26.180 
hi this is Akshay somebody from Team bhp
from<00:00:24.660> my<00:00:24.780> preliminary<00:00:24.990> test<00:00:25.680> drive<00:00:25.860> it's

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:26.190 
from my preliminary test drive it's

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.310 
from my preliminary test drive it's
going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.460> be<00:00:26.580> a<00:00:26.880> great<00:00:27.270> cup<00:00:27.540> it's<00:00:27.810> not<00:00:28.020> only<00:00:28.170> a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
going to be a great cup it's not only a

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.170 
going to be a great cup it's not only a
good<00:00:28.530> city<00:00:28.830> car<00:00:29.100> to<00:00:29.250> drive<00:00:29.430> because<00:00:29.850> it's<00:00:30.000> got

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:30.180 
good city car to drive because it's got

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.570 
good city car to drive because it's got
enough<00:00:30.510> low-end<00:00:30.930> torque<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.440> keep<00:00:31.680> it<00:00:32.369> going

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:32.580 
enough low-end torque to keep it going

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:34.729 
enough low-end torque to keep it going
but<00:00:33.239> also<00:00:33.420> once<00:00:33.810> you<00:00:33.930> move<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.290> to<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.470> higher

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
but also once you move up to the higher

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.630 
but also once you move up to the higher
revs<00:00:35.070> then<00:00:35.400> it<00:00:35.850> also<00:00:36.300> has<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.690> the<00:00:37.640> sufficient

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
revs then it also has the the sufficient

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.160 
revs then it also has the the sufficient
power<00:00:38.820> which<00:00:39.150> is<00:00:39.300> required<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> highway

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
power which is required on the highway

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.630 
power which is required on the highway
so<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.500> going<00:00:40.620> to<00:00:40.710> be<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.830> good<00:00:41.040> highway<00:00:41.430> car

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
so it's going to be a good highway car

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.970 
so it's going to be a good highway car
as<00:00:41.790> well<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.239> I'd<00:00:42.690> say<00:00:43.020> good<00:00:43.260> all-round<00:00:43.710> car

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
as well so I'd say good all-round car

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:55.270 
as well so I'd say good all-round car
light<00:00:44.309> clutch<00:00:44.640> good<00:00:45.090> gear<00:00:45.330> shift

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
for the first thing that stands out is

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.960 
for the first thing that stands out is
itself<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.010> reason<00:01:17.340> why<00:01:17.460> it's<00:01:17.610> called<00:01:17.670> the

Vista<00:01:18.210> 90<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.960> engine<00:01:19.640> with<00:01:20.640> this<00:01:20.880> you<00:01:21.090> can

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
Vista 90 the engine with this you can

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.180 
Vista 90 the engine with this you can
see<00:01:21.510> whether<00:01:21.720> 90<00:01:22.140> horses<00:01:22.500> are<00:01:22.650> going<00:01:22.890> it's<00:01:23.070> a

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190 
see whether 90 horses are going it's a

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.000 
see whether 90 horses are going it's a
fun<00:01:23.520> car<00:01:23.760> too<00:01:23.940> high<00:01:24.120> rev<00:01:24.590> about<00:01:25.590> three<00:01:25.830> three

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
fun car too high rev about three three

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.580 
fun car too high rev about three three
and<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.220> half<00:01:26.400> thousand<00:01:26.820> rpm<00:01:26.940> when<00:01:27.509> that<00:01:27.720> power

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and a half thousand rpm when that power

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.740 
and a half thousand rpm when that power
and<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> top<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.460> all<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.119> know<00:01:30.240> building<00:01:30.570> up

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
and the top is all you know building up

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.140 
and the top is all you know building up
it's<00:01:31.500> it's<00:01:31.860> quite<00:01:32.040> a<00:01:32.130> fun<00:01:32.400> car<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.790> high<00:01:32.940> rev

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
it's it's quite a fun car to high rev

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:35.300 
it's it's quite a fun car to high rev
and<00:01:33.390> once<00:01:34.170> you're<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> power<00:01:34.979> band

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
and once you're in the power band

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.790 
and once you're in the power band
I<00:01:35.340> think<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.790> peak<00:01:35.970> power<00:01:36.180> is<00:01:36.240> at<00:01:36.540> 6000<00:01:37.170> rpm<00:01:37.590> I

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
I think the peak power is at 6000 rpm I

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.430 
I think the peak power is at 6000 rpm I
mean<00:01:38.070> 90<00:01:38.340> bhp<00:01:38.550> in<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.210> small<00:01:39.479> hatch<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.110> quite<00:01:40.410> a

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
mean 90 bhp in a small hatch is quite a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.070 
mean 90 bhp in a small hatch is quite a
handful<00:01:41.130> also<00:01:42.060> overtaking<00:01:42.630> maneuvers<00:01:43.050> like

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:43.080 
handful also overtaking maneuvers like

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.370 
handful also overtaking maneuvers like
these<00:01:43.440> for<00:01:43.680> example<00:01:44.130> you<00:01:44.190> can<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.400> floor<00:01:44.850> it

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
these for example you can just floor it

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.920 
these for example you can just floor it
and<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> powers<00:01:46.740> there<00:01:47.009> in<00:01:47.509> this<00:01:48.509> more<00:01:48.720> and

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
and the powers there in this more and

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.290 
and the powers there in this more and
you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.170> go<00:01:49.320> up<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.560> 6,000<00:01:50.160> rpm<00:01:50.580> like<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:53.300> and

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:54.300 
you can go up to 6,000 rpm like this and

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:55.400 
you can go up to 6,000 rpm like this and
you<00:01:54.390> can<00:01:54.540> see<00:01:54.690> where<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> power<00:01:55.170> is

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:55.410 
you can see where the power is

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.560 
you can see where the power is
and<00:01:55.890> even<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.280> exhaust<00:01:56.640> on<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.030> engine<00:01:57.360> note

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
and even the exhaust on the engine note

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.530 
and even the exhaust on the engine note
rather<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.680> becomes<00:01:59.190> this<00:01:59.340> raspy<00:01:59.729> muscular

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
rather it becomes this raspy muscular

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.140 
rather it becomes this raspy muscular
load<00:02:01.170> when<00:02:01.620> you're<00:02:01.800> when<00:02:02.130> you're<00:02:02.159> past<00:02:02.520> 4000

rpm<00:02:03.540> that's<00:02:04.260> also<00:02:04.620> another<00:02:04.830> fun

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
rpm that's also another fun

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
the clutch is still good the gearshift

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.990 
the clutch is still good the gearshift
has<00:02:23.930> really<00:02:24.380> moved<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.890> for<00:02:25.130> Tata<00:02:25.340> I<00:02:25.640> mean<00:02:25.790> this

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
has really moved on for Tata I mean this

it's quite spacious shouldn't have any
problem<00:02:36.800> seating<00:02:37.190> for<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.580> luggage<00:02:37.880> if<00:02:38.360> your

problem seating for and luggage if your

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.280 
problem seating for and luggage if your
occupants<00:02:40.160> are<00:02:40.370> not<00:02:40.520> too<00:02:40.700> big<00:02:40.940> then<00:02:41.420> five

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:42.290 
occupants are not too big then five

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:49.850 
occupants are not too big then five
could<00:02:42.560> also<00:02:42.740> fit<00:02:43.160> in

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.200 

what<00:02:50.860> we're<00:02:51.040> driving<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.610> I<00:02:51.640> think<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.090> the

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
what we're driving here I think is the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.840 
what we're driving here I think is the
aura<00:02:52.390> plus<00:02:52.810> the<00:02:53.350> dolphin<00:02:53.680> version<00:02:54.040> so<00:02:54.670> they

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
aura plus the dolphin version so they

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:59.360 
aura plus the dolphin version so they
got<00:02:55.150> front<00:02:56.020> airbags<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.680> abs<00:02:57.130> is<00:02:57.820> there<00:02:58.150> so

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
got front airbags and abs is there so

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.070 
got front airbags and abs is there so
we're<00:03:00.370> pretty<00:03:00.760> well<00:03:01.060> sorted<00:03:01.480> in<00:03:01.690> terms<00:03:01.930> of

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080 
we're pretty well sorted in terms of

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.740 
we're pretty well sorted in terms of
safety<00:03:02.320> features<00:03:03.300> looking<00:03:04.300> at<00:03:04.390> the<00:03:04.510> equipment

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
safety features looking at the equipment

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.880 
safety features looking at the equipment
list<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.320> have<00:03:05.560> here<00:03:06.690> single<00:03:07.690> CD<00:03:08.080> or<00:03:08.470> audio

so<00:03:11.710> that<00:03:11.950> is<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.820> think<00:03:13.390> that's<00:03:13.720> the<00:03:13.810> first<00:03:14.020> in

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
so that is I think that's the first in

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.680 
so that is I think that's the first in
this<00:03:14.380> segment<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:15.640> terms<00:03:15.700> of<00:03:16.060> all-round

this segment in terms of all-round

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.780 
this segment in terms of all-round
visibility<00:03:16.980> we<00:03:17.980> have<00:03:18.160> great<00:03:18.430> visibility

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
visibility we have great visibility

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.060 
visibility we have great visibility
there<00:03:19.420> are<00:03:19.510> large<00:03:19.720> mirrors<00:03:20.110> again<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.710> helps

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
there are large mirrors again that helps

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:26.280 
there are large mirrors again that helps
