 It's going to be another 15 minutes . 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:12.299
 I come from a stir and then it will be 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:16.170

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:18.660
 15 more minutes always move, but 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.609
 when you see that it stirs iron and 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.180
 thickening I'll show you how it is 

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.180
 that will stay 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.579
 then the person is here after 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:35.670
 up again with boiling milk 

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:39.299
 I left the clock for five minutes. 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:44.010
 as it has thickened and turned more 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.889
 also looking thicker, 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.190
 Go to see the creaminess then here already 

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:55.109
 Are you ready to call let a 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:56.700
 Bit of a turn off the fire, that's what I 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.769
 I'll stop taking a little bit of what I 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.079
 the rose will still loose the little bit of the 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:03.870
 friend and it will thicken 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:07.019
 if you leave more it will dry there will not 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:10.970
 stay creamy taboo here 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.970
 just let it cool a little bit now 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:20.639

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:41.130
 This one is very creamy and the coconut that I 

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:43.830

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:50.730

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:53.160
 But I love sweet rice and this is you. 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:55.890
 the texture that coconut gives along with 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:59.670
 music when the mold is very good 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:04.050

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:07.230
