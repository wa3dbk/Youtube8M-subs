00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.070
 there are many games that we 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:11.799
 we normally play with the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.009
 Your friends only fps racing games 

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:16.780
 fighting games but there are some games that 

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:19.600
 the healthy dispute between players 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.430
 trash in giving up and can cause 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.220
 user death 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.040
 but the games I will tell you here today 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.470
 takes the dispute to another level 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.480
 you will live soon what you have already played 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.999
 You'll know that already, right? 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:38.850
 my big heads today's video is about 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:38.850
 mario party cold osmium part 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.530
 before starting the same video of it already 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.110
 have started 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.820
 I will tell you here that I will comment on several 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.219
 Join us on a Saturday. 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.649
 logically only I played so 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.199
 always your fat ass in this chain and 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.210
 they go there from most of the three 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.310
 is the favorite and also another game 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.190
 But let's start from the beginning 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.440
 mario party one tired at 98 for 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.240
 nintendo 64 bringing a good idea 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.549
 different by picking up the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.710
 super mario franchise and playing a 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:21.020
 with the purpose that in order to 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.420
 win if he can get more stars 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.100
 more money than your opponent 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.200
 game went very well on the question 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.929
 multiplayer then up to four people 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.819
 could play what is very little that 

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.560
 three friends playing with the end of the 

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:36.080
 game appeared in games to give you 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.970
 money and want the woman's house was the 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.130
 one that had an effect on the basis of 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830
 blue blocks that gave you three coins 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.720
 I used to speak red and draw three coins. 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.000
 the square bettor that everyone bet 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.700
 a certain amount in one for no one 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.679
 who rated good and so had several 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.599
 obstacles to the conduct of the game 

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:55.789
 but it all happened in a good way 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.429
 simple and the scenery more that were 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.099
 beautiful and there to me it seemed very empty 

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:02.869
 I felt a lot of fiber, too. 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:05.289
 I think it should be a game after 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.289
 training game 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.180
 a year later came Mario Part 2 he 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.819
 already rolled up that was good almost 6 seem 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.830
 having a lot more life was more creative 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.170
 had a story mode more or less 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:20.569
 but it was acceptable and the novelty is that 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.640
 you could use the item purchase items in 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.739
 some map points or wins depending 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.269
 the house you step on and could use 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.790
 to get faster to the extreme for 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:32.290
 do with your friends, and by many 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.290
 considered the best size in May 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:37.720
 Mari, the paté tri, I love to say that. 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.100
 for me it's one of the biggest spenders 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 serious casual multiplayer games 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.820
 now in this game has a lot of 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.310
 decent story that is cool even for 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.890
 use more than one item in the game 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.130
 to close with you but more mygames 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.380
 mass who used luck skill but 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.700
 Bouncing boards of the whore Balzi 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.700
 has always been present since the first 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.440
 who always satire scathing two or three 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.970
 out of some way or was at all 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.830
 world also takes that it also remembers in the 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.650
 bo is that ghost or someone 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.510
 it was spent on him and paid for it 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:15.670
 steal your soft star that you 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.890
 He paid 20 coins so that everything was 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.350
 Good luck already began the mortal hatred 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:22.180
 among friends but had way 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:32.950
 makes people sick for time 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:34.300
 can a mortal boss our house you have 

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:36.580
 to learn everything from you to get a 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.350
 whole show in a matter of seconds because 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:41.440
 It's when I was younger, I fought with 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.640
 My friend, a cousin because of this. 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:48.190
 But it was all a joke, it's the 1 and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.410
 still had a new board mode of 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.380
 certain way it will be a rpg you wore 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:55.300
 two little pets listened to blame guilty one 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:59.410
 in front and one behind a wholesale not 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.210
 he argued that each had 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.560
 use this and more you do not like yourself 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:04.300
 you need to use this so that it 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.920
 It will be the game and just a matter of taste, I 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.850
 liked phases of most of the 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.890
 center mario party 3031 bad but here 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.200
 two and there I found a lot of mass 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.950
 the old west, the taboo is 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.660
 very low 

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:19.859
 the feeling of playing a game like that 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:23.560
 first time is magic 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.690
 mario party 4567 I did not play because it is 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.370
 public so I will not comment because 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.590
 It's going to blow some shit about me. 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.540
 they impressed it's mario party 8 or 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:34.390
 cathedral when I caught my indigo 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:36.670
 Apr the xavi a surprise the game is cool 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.890
 no one is very creative but the same 

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:41.020
 the most fascinating idea of washing the 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:43.750
 star payment no longer exists each 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.330
 phase has a rule and we have to follow it 

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:48.760
 wanting or not there was no more items 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.270
 itself if it was bullets that you 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:55.500
 had an effect will item is this 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:05:01.380
 the shake did and severe going out was well over 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:04.800
 or less but the bê all lie plus the 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.560
 more or fears but the top v 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:09.240
 annoying bigger size should we say 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.600
 which was what I most played in quality 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.460
 for the simple fact that I have 13 10 df 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:17.670
 I already saw him play play with my cousin 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.070
 no room fuck most of May 31 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:22.260
 easy to 18 but a little cool 

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.750
 so a car trip when you have a 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:27.210
 fucking traffic and finally Mario 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:29.550
 party name that was to the user a legal 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.210
 clear investing play with another 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.280
 person 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.920
 but I think it 's because I think so 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:38.340
 who swallowed the fact of the four dates 

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:40.680
 together and never wants it in the car does not have 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.390
 This fucking sense of islam make 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.920
 successful children who seem to be 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.080
 boys began to be more focused on 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.760
 one stronger than skill 

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.150
 I was hurt by this is more to do. 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.150
 what 

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.970

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:59.770
