your eyeballs and that's why the cotton

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.030 
your eyeballs and that's why the cotton
swab<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.809> there<00:01:03.989> because<00:01:04.500> it's<00:01:04.680> easier<00:01:04.979> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
swab is there because it's easier to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.560

maneuver instead of using your fingers

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.420

you might just lock your eyeball up and

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.609 
you might just lock your eyeball up and
but<00:01:08.760> it<00:01:08.880> just<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.450> be<00:01:09.479> pretty<00:01:09.750> gross<00:01:10.020> so

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
but it just would be pretty gross so

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.990 
but it just would be pretty gross so
just<00:01:10.890> use<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> cotton<00:01:11.280> swab<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.549> be<00:01:11.760> gentle
