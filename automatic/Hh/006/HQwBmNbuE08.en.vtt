00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:08.670
 hello friends I'm Pablo dry and you 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:11.429
 I come with the unboxing of an ipad 3 in my 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.650
 previous life you could see the ignition 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.540
 and configuration but today I bring you the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.490
 unboxing because I had to change it 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.410
 for problems in the battery then 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 well, it happened that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.000
 I lost the other video of the one box and not you 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.190
 I can bring a new model to choose 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.309
 is a 64 gb model this is because 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:34.560
 I decided to take it from 64 since now with the 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.130
 new from 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:40.230
 the retina screen and other stories is 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.140
 more likely that applications weigh 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.330
 more and I would not like to have small 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.300
 problems so good let's start 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.400
 with the unboxing you already know the box 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.800
 there is hardly difference with that of ipad 2 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:56.010
 nothing more than this little picture of 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.130
 here that brings the ipad background over here 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.710
 the icloud ipad logo and here the 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:05.930
 symbol of the apple then we're going to 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.930
 proceed to remove the plastic from behind 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.979
 and once removed we can already remove the 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.200
 box to access what would be the 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:18.289
 device 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:22.329
 we remove this little box and we have 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.329
 here our device 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.830
 with this little eyelash here with which 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.830
 we can lift and remove now we will go 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.620
 to this the content of the box is 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:36.410
 completely equal to that of ipad 2 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:40.250
 we have here the adapter to the 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.210
 current the usb charger with socket for 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.640
 connect our ipad to the light and so 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.830
 can load it and we also have here 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.830
 our manual then that comes with 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 everything about new 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:59.400
 ipad settings 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:01.670
 projects guarantees and stickers 

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.670
 paper 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.799
 finally in the background comes our 

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:08.959
 small 30-pin usb cable for 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.360
 connect the ipad to the computer 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.459
 or to the current as we wanted 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.500
 set it up last and passing the 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.440
 device we have here our ipad 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.060
 that is wrapped in this little envelope 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.489
 of plastic 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.209
 we take from here behind and what we do 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:25.209
 to stretch 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.569
 to end up discovering what would be 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:34.069
 all the device 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.069
 we can pull out here behind 

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:41.460
 and already we would have outdoors so 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.160
 say it 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:49.220
 our ipad 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.220
 as we can see there 64 gb 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:56.430
 and a little the general specifications 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.010
 of said device good friends then 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.079
 if you want to see the video of how it 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.299
 set up an ipad for the first time 

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:04.950

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.230

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.060

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.250
 using this model around a 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.840
 week will soon bring the review 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.670
 general counting a little 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.310
 specifications and comparisons with 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.260
 ipad2 that I have noticed more nobly 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.780
 and of course I will also comment on 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.889
