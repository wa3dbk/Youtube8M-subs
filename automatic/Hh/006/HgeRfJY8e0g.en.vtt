00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
but it's called a v-twin so it's a lot

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.580

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
twin that's what makes up of the twin so

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.130 
twin that's what makes up of the twin so
a<00:02:12.580> lot<00:02:12.850> of<00:02:12.880> cruisers<00:02:13.270> are<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.540> this<00:02:13.720> holidays

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
a lot of cruisers are like this holidays

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.930 
a lot of cruisers are like this holidays
are<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.380> this<00:02:14.530> they<00:02:15.220> have<00:02:15.370> different<00:02:15.550> degree

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 
are like this they have different degree

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.000 
are like this they have different degree
angles<00:02:16.360> though<00:02:16.570> this<00:02:17.140> is<00:02:17.350> a<00:02:17.380> 90-degree<00:02:17.980> angle

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010

90<00:02:35.740> degree<00:02:36.360> really<00:02:37.360> nice<00:02:37.510> is<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.959> is<00:02:38.080> very<00:02:38.350> very

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
90 degree really nice is it is very very

southeast Ohio I'm not afraid to go

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.390 
southeast Ohio I'm not afraid to go
climbing<00:03:11.500> into<00:03:11.709> some<00:03:11.800> of<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.070> backcountry

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
climbing into some of the backcountry

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.130 
climbing into some of the backcountry
back<00:03:12.730> there<00:03:12.970> get<00:03:13.480> on<00:03:13.600> ground<00:03:13.810> will<00:03:13.930> get<00:03:14.050> on

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
back there get on ground will get on

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.900 
back there get on ground will get on
some<00:03:14.290> ravines<00:03:14.590> it<00:03:15.220> gets<00:03:15.400> a<00:03:15.489> little<00:03:15.640> little

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
some ravines it gets a little little

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.160 
some ravines it gets a little little
heavy<00:03:16.120> when<00:03:16.269> he<00:03:16.330> started<00:03:16.600> getting<00:03:16.780> into<00:03:16.989> some

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
heavy when he started getting into some

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.449 
heavy when he started getting into some
and<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.380> really<00:03:17.530> tough<00:03:17.769> stuff<00:03:18.010> compared<00:03:18.370> to

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
and that really tough stuff compared to

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:21.600 
and that really tough stuff compared to
like<00:03:18.580> a<00:03:19.230> 400cc<00:03:20.230> bike<00:03:20.590> which<00:03:20.769> is<00:03:20.890> more<00:03:21.100> an<00:03:21.400> app

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:21.610 
like a 400cc bike which is more an app

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:23.910 
like a 400cc bike which is more an app
for<00:03:21.790> that<00:03:21.850> or<00:03:22.090> a<00:03:22.120> 650<00:03:22.720> but<00:03:23.380> you<00:03:23.620> can<00:03:23.769> get<00:03:23.830> her

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
for that or a 650 but you can get her

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:25.650 
for that or a 650 but you can get her
done<00:03:24.070> you<00:03:24.580> even<00:03:24.730> have<00:03:24.820> a<00:03:24.880> skid<00:03:25.120> plate<00:03:25.330> down<00:03:25.510> on

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
done you even have a skid plate down on

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.240 
done you even have a skid plate down on
the<00:03:25.720> bottom<00:03:25.840> there<00:03:26.080> for<00:03:26.230> my<00:03:26.320> drag<00:03:26.560> over<00:03:26.860> rocks

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the bottom there for my drag over rocks

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.610 
the bottom there for my drag over rocks
and<00:03:27.519> things<00:03:27.610> like<00:03:27.820> that<00:03:27.880> which<00:03:28.630> I<00:03:28.750> have<00:03:28.930> used<00:03:29.410> a

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
and things like that which I have used a

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.310 
and things like that which I have used a
few<00:03:29.739> times<00:03:29.800> and<00:03:30.900> that's<00:03:31.900> a<00:03:32.019> little<00:03:32.170> bit<00:03:32.260> how

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
few times and that's a little bit how

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.170 
few times and that's a little bit how
she<00:03:32.380> runs<00:03:32.680> here<00:03:32.950> so<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:33.640> an<00:03:33.700> aluminum<00:03:34.090> frame

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
she runs here so it's an aluminum frame

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.360 
she runs here so it's an aluminum frame
bike<00:03:34.480> there's<00:03:35.049> your<00:03:35.170> frame<00:03:35.500> here<00:03:35.709> that's<00:03:36.250> an

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
bike there's your frame here that's an

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.850 
bike there's your frame here that's an
aluminum<00:03:36.820> frame<00:03:36.970> across<00:03:37.720> there<00:03:37.989> goes<00:03:38.500> back<00:03:38.709> to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:38.860 
aluminum frame across there goes back to

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.949 
aluminum frame across there goes back to
the<00:03:38.920> swing<00:03:39.130> arm<00:03:39.310> chain<00:03:39.730> drive<00:03:39.940> reduce<00:03:40.690> weight

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
the swing arm chain drive reduce weight

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.320 
the swing arm chain drive reduce weight
and<00:03:41.230> cost<00:03:41.580> the<00:03:42.580> bigger<00:03:42.760> bikes<00:03:43.030> will<00:03:43.209> have

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
and cost the bigger bikes will have

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.840 
and cost the bigger bikes will have
shaft<00:03:43.630> drives<00:03:43.989> on<00:03:44.200> them<00:03:44.320> which<00:03:44.799> are<00:03:45.100> arguably

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
shaft drives on them which are arguably

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.699 
shaft drives on them which are arguably
they<00:03:46.450> have<00:03:46.600> less<00:03:46.810> maintenance<00:03:47.200> but<00:03:47.590> they're

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:47.709 
they have less maintenance but they're

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:50.160 
they have less maintenance but they're
much<00:03:48.010> more<00:03:48.250> costly<00:03:48.700> initially<00:03:49.570> to<00:03:49.690> buy<00:03:49.780> again

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:50.170 
much more costly initially to buy again

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.780 
much more costly initially to buy again
this<00:03:50.320> is<00:03:50.440> a<00:03:50.470> low<00:03:50.739> input<00:03:51.010> bike<00:03:51.370> right<00:03:51.580> off<00:03:51.670> the

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
this is a low input bike right off the

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.870 
this is a low input bike right off the
get-go<00:03:51.970> and<00:03:52.810> also<00:03:53.560> they<00:03:53.830> do<00:03:53.890> lose<00:03:54.310> energy<00:03:54.549> and

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
get-go and also they do lose energy and

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:57.060 
get-go and also they do lose energy and
power<00:03:55.030> transfer<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.900> they<00:03:56.470> do<00:03:56.530> hit<00:03:56.799> require

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
power transfer and they do hit require

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:58.320 
power transfer and they do hit require
maintenance<00:03:57.310> down<00:03:57.640> the<00:03:57.790> road<00:03:57.940> and<00:03:58.090> they<00:03:58.209> are

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
maintenance down the road and they are

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.600 
maintenance down the road and they are
quite<00:03:58.510> expensive<00:03:58.739> this<00:03:59.739> bike<00:03:59.950> is<00:03:59.980> designed<00:04:00.459> to

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
quite expensive this bike is designed to

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:05.640 
quite expensive this bike is designed to
be<00:04:00.730> a<00:04:02.700> low-cost<00:04:03.700> bike<00:04:04.090> really<00:04:04.480> it<00:04:04.600> is<00:04:04.780> that<00:04:05.170> I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
be a low-cost bike really it is that I

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.979 
be a low-cost bike really it is that I
think<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.340> lists<00:04:06.790> for<00:04:07.090> around<00:04:07.299> seventy<00:04:07.780> six

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:07.989 
think it lists for around seventy six

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.120 
think it lists for around seventy six
hundred<00:04:08.260> dollars<00:04:08.290> or<00:04:08.680> something<00:04:08.980> like<00:04:09.070> that
