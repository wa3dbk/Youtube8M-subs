you may have seen my recent video on the
basics<00:00:11.240> of<00:00:11.330> green-screen<00:00:11.809> well<00:00:12.799> in<00:00:12.920> this

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:13.040 
basics of green-screen well in this

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:15.290 
basics of green-screen well in this
quick<00:00:13.370> video<00:00:13.490> I'm<00:00:13.760> going<00:00:13.850> to<00:00:13.910> talk<00:00:14.030> about

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:15.300 
quick video I'm going to talk about

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.750 
quick video I'm going to talk about
subtle<00:00:15.540> but<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.990> find<00:00:16.320> really<00:00:16.470> interesting<00:00:17.070> so

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
subtle but I find really interesting so

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.250 
subtle but I find really interesting so
as<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.240> may<00:00:18.390> or<00:00:18.480> may<00:00:18.570> not<00:00:18.600> know

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
as you may or may not know

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.700 
as you may or may not know
no<00:00:19.830> green<00:00:20.240> screen<00:00:21.240> no<00:00:21.450> green<00:00:21.690> body<00:00:21.930> is<00:00:22.290> really

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
no green screen no green body is really

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.650 
no green screen no green body is really
ever<00:00:23.340> gonna<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.670> perfect<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.240> that<00:00:24.390> it's<00:00:24.510> never

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
ever gonna be perfect in that it's never

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.810 
ever gonna be perfect in that it's never
only<00:00:24.930> gonna<00:00:25.350> reflect<00:00:25.619> green<00:00:25.980> light<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
only gonna reflect green light the

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.089 
only gonna reflect green light the
reason<00:00:27.090> it<00:00:27.150> looks<00:00:27.270> green<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.200> our<00:00:28.290> eyes<00:00:28.439> is

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
reason it looks green to our eyes is

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.220 
reason it looks green to our eyes is
that<00:00:29.250> it<00:00:29.340> reflects<00:00:29.610> mostly<00:00:30.150> green<00:00:30.360> light<00:00:30.570> but

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
that it reflects mostly green light but

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.720 
that it reflects mostly green light but
it's<00:00:31.349> also<00:00:31.500> going<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> reflect<00:00:32.340> some<00:00:32.550> other

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
it's also going to reflect some other

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.700 
it's also going to reflect some other
colors<00:00:33.090> so<00:00:33.660> if<00:00:33.750> you<00:00:33.840> shine<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.079> full-spectrum

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
colors so if you shine a full-spectrum

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.760 
colors so if you shine a full-spectrum
light<00:00:34.920> on<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.850> green<00:00:36.239> color<00:00:36.840> you're<00:00:37.650> gonna

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
light on that green color you're gonna

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
light on that green color you're gonna
get<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.310> little<00:00:39.090> few<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.480> other<00:00:39.630> colors

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
get a little few of the other colors

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
get a little few of the other colors
back<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.560> that's<00:00:40.829> gonna<00:00:41.010> make<00:00:41.190> that<00:00:41.310> green

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
back and that's gonna make that green

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.550 
back and that's gonna make that green
not<00:00:41.790> look<00:00:42.030> quite<00:00:42.270> as<00:00:42.390> vibrant<00:00:42.780> as<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.230> could

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:43.560 
not look quite as vibrant as it could

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.860 
not look quite as vibrant as it could
and<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:44.730> want<00:00:44.970> when<00:00:45.210> you're<00:00:45.300> keying<00:00:45.570> is

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
and what you want when you're keying is

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.020 
and what you want when you're keying is
a<00:00:45.899> vibrant<00:00:46.560> green<00:00:46.920> where<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.280> only<00:00:47.430> color

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
a vibrant green where the only color

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.290 
a vibrant green where the only color
you're<00:00:48.300> getting<00:00:48.600> is<00:00:48.750> green<00:00:49.260> so<00:00:50.030> what<00:00:51.030> you<00:00:51.149> need

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
you're getting is green so what you need

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.209 
you're getting is green so what you need
to<00:00:51.390> do<00:00:51.539> is<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.840> need<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.050> shine<00:00:52.230> only<00:00:52.949> green

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
to do is you need to shine only green

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.729 
to do is you need to shine only green
light<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:54.840> green<00:00:55.019> screen<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.559> there's<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
light on that green screen and there's a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
light on that green screen and there's a
couple<00:00:55.890> different<00:00:56.190> ways<00:00:56.219> to<00:00:56.309> do<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.789> one<00:00:57.420> way

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
couple different ways to do this one way

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.630 
couple different ways to do this one way
is<00:00:57.899> Kino<00:00:58.230> flow<00:00:58.469> for<00:00:58.649> example<00:00:58.679> makes<00:00:59.280> green

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
is Kino flow for example makes green

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.160 
is Kino flow for example makes green
bulbs<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.179> put<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.449> your<00:01:00.539> Kino<00:01:00.750> flow<00:01:00.960> fixtures

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
bulbs to put in your Kino flow fixtures

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.860 
bulbs to put in your Kino flow fixtures
and<00:01:01.769> since<00:01:02.160> they're<00:01:02.309> a<00:01:02.339> big<00:01:02.730> wide<00:01:03.089> source<00:01:03.510> they

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
and since they're a big wide source they

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.500 
and since they're a big wide source they
can<00:01:04.019> cover<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.320> lot<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:04.820> area<00:01:05.820> evenly<00:01:06.270> they're<00:01:06.480> a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
can cover a lot of area evenly they're a

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.760 
can cover a lot of area evenly they're a
really<00:01:06.720> good<00:01:06.900> choice<00:01:07.110> for<00:01:07.170> lighting<00:01:07.650> your

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
really good choice for lighting your

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.020 
really good choice for lighting your
green<00:01:07.950> screen<00:01:09.380> another<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.710> do<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.070> is<00:01:11.430> for

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
green screen another way to do it is for

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.450 
green screen another way to do it is for
example<00:01:12.180> an<00:01:12.570> airy<00:01:12.810> l7c<00:01:13.680> which<00:01:13.980> we<00:01:14.130> happen<00:01:14.280> to

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
example an airy l7c which we happen to

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.760 
example an airy l7c which we happen to
have<00:01:14.640> now<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.300> is<00:01:15.450> an<00:01:15.540> LED<00:01:15.720> light<00:01:16.050> that

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
have now this is an LED light that

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.600 
have now this is an LED light that
allows<00:01:16.980> you<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.159> change<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> color

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
allows you to change the color

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.050 
allows you to change the color
temperature<00:01:18.060> very<00:01:18.510> easily<00:01:18.720> between<00:01:19.350> you<00:01:19.860> know

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
temperature very easily between you know

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
temperature very easily between you know
tungsten<00:01:21.060> and<00:01:21.290> daylight<00:01:22.290> color<00:01:22.530> temperature

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
tungsten and daylight color temperature

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.360 
tungsten and daylight color temperature
but<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.610> also<00:01:23.850> has<00:01:24.630> what's<00:01:25.530> called<00:01:25.710> a<00:01:25.800> humo

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
but it also has what's called a humo

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.740 
but it also has what's called a humo
which<00:01:26.640> allows<00:01:26.880> you<00:01:27.000> to<00:01:27.030> pick<00:01:27.210> any<00:01:27.360> color<00:01:27.690> of

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
which allows you to pick any color of

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.840 
which allows you to pick any color of
the<00:01:27.840> rainbow<00:01:27.930> and<00:01:28.470> have<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.070> LED<00:01:29.460> light<00:01:29.670> only

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
the rainbow and have the LED light only

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.410 
the rainbow and have the LED light only
put<00:01:30.330> that<00:01:30.480> light<00:01:30.660> out<00:01:30.690> so<00:01:31.080> as<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.620> demonstration

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
put that light out so as a demonstration

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.580 
put that light out so as a demonstration
I'm<00:01:33.420> going<00:01:33.570> to<00:01:33.720> do<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> real<00:01:34.080> quick<00:01:34.110> change

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
I'm going to do a real quick change

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.220 
I'm going to do a real quick change
between<00:01:35.270> what<00:01:36.270> I<00:01:36.300> have<00:01:36.510> here<00:01:36.930> which<00:01:37.200> is

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:37.230 
between what I have here which is

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:39.770 
between what I have here which is
tungsten<00:01:37.860> light<00:01:38.130> on<00:01:38.250> me<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:38.880> cameras<00:01:39.240> balance

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
tungsten light on me the cameras balance

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.630 
tungsten light on me the cameras balance
for<00:01:39.960> tungsten<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.530> I'm<00:01:40.920> shooting<00:01:41.100> tungsten

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
for tungsten and I'm shooting tungsten

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.730 
for tungsten and I'm shooting tungsten
light<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.120> my<00:01:42.240> area<00:01:42.510> l7c<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.650> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
light out of my area l7c on to the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.370 
light out of my area l7c on to the
background<00:01:44.130> however<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.270> I<00:01:45.660> really<00:01:46.020> quickly

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
background however if I really quickly

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.320 
background however if I really quickly
switch<00:01:46.650> it<00:01:46.830> from<00:01:47.040> tungsten<00:01:47.550> light<00:01:47.730> to<00:01:48.090> just

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
switch it from tungsten light to just

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.260 
going to give me a really sharp key and

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.290 
going to give me a really sharp key and
it's<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.560> be<00:01:58.620> a<00:01:58.650> lot<00:01:58.800> more<00:01:58.950> a<00:01:59.520> lot<00:02:00.090> better

it's going to be a lot more a lot better

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.360 
it's going to be a lot more a lot better
than<00:02:00.540> just<00:02:00.570> shooting<00:02:00.890> regular<00:02:01.890> tungsten

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.370 
than just shooting regular tungsten

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.790 
than just shooting regular tungsten
light<00:02:02.520> onto<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.910> green<00:02:03.120> so<00:02:03.960> I<00:02:04.260> hope<00:02:04.620> that's

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800
