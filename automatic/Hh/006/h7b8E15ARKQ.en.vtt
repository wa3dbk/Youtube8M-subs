Lisa<00:00:25.199> site<00:00:25.470> is<00:00:25.619> basically<00:00:26.250> much<00:00:26.430> more<00:00:26.730> about

the<00:00:31.019> work<00:00:31.199> we<00:00:31.349> do<00:00:31.529> we<00:00:31.740> always<00:00:31.890> try<00:00:32.130> and<00:00:32.250> find

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
the work we do we always try and find

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.970 
the work we do we always try and find
something<00:00:32.790> that<00:00:33.170> hits<00:00:34.170> home<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.710> hits<00:00:34.860> a

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
something that hits home and hits a

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
something that hits home and hits a
grain<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.250> truth<00:00:35.399> perhaps<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:36.000> hidden<00:00:36.540> truth

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
grain of truth perhaps a hidden truth

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
but that basically makes you reassess

definite<00:01:09.150> is<00:01:09.420> definitely<00:01:09.900> language<00:01:10.350> that<00:01:10.590> I

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
definite is definitely language that I

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.850 
definite is definitely language that I
wouldn't<00:01:11.130> go<00:01:11.670> near<00:01:11.700> as<00:01:12.600> phase<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.260> think

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
a no no I'm not quite sure why probably

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
a no no I'm not quite sure why probably
because<00:01:20.400> legally<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.479> much<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:21.869> to<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
because legally it much like to do it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.670

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.150 
then that's when things get interesting
and<00:02:16.720> I<00:02:16.780> suppose<00:02:17.020> that's<00:02:17.170> what<00:02:17.440> poets<00:02:17.800> do<00:02:17.980> it's

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
and I suppose that's what poets do it's

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.699 
and I suppose that's what poets do it's
what<00:02:18.340> artists<00:02:19.120> do<00:02:19.360> there's<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.230> limit<00:02:20.530> to<00:02:20.560> how

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
what artists do there's a limit to how

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.190 
what artists do there's a limit to how
much<00:02:21.010> controversy<00:02:21.610> I<00:02:21.880> think<00:02:22.150> you<00:02:22.300> you<00:02:23.020> can

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
much controversy I think you you can

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.979 
much controversy I think you you can
legitimately<00:02:23.730> create<00:02:24.730> in<00:02:25.269> advertising<00:02:25.690> and

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989 
legitimately create in advertising and

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.040 
legitimately create in advertising and
rightly<00:02:26.410> so<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.980> mean<00:02:27.190> ultimately<00:02:28.050> you're

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
rightly so I mean ultimately you're

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.600 
rightly so I mean ultimately you're
trying<00:02:29.290> to<00:02:29.380> start<00:02:29.650> conversation<00:02:30.370> you're<00:02:30.489> not

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
trying to start conversation you're not

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.270 
trying to start conversation you're not
trying<00:02:30.790> to<00:02:30.910> just<00:02:31.290> say<00:02:32.290> the<00:02:32.410> way<00:02:32.530> back<00:02:32.920> and<00:02:33.100> hope

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:33.280 
trying to just say the way back and hope

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.570 
trying to just say the way back and hope
that<00:02:33.459> everyone<00:02:33.700> sort<00:02:34.150> of<00:02:35.130> comes<00:02:36.130> and<00:02:36.250> listens

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
that everyone sort of comes and listens

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.890 
that everyone sort of comes and listens
to<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:36.850> what<00:02:37.060> you've<00:02:37.209> got<00:02:37.360> to<00:02:37.480> say<00:02:37.510> that

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
to you what you've got to say that

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.259 
to you what you've got to say that
doesn't<00:02:38.170> work<00:02:38.350> do<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.130> describe<00:02:39.519> yourself<00:02:39.819> as

00:02:40.259 --> 00:02:40.269 
doesn't work do you describe yourself as

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:42.930 
doesn't work do you describe yourself as
a<00:02:40.330> writer<00:02:40.660> I<00:02:41.160> prefer<00:02:42.160> the<00:02:42.400> expression<00:02:42.819> right

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:42.940 
a writer I prefer the expression right

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.140 
a writer I prefer the expression right
it's<00:02:43.180> a<00:02:43.330> sort<00:02:43.540> of<00:02:43.600> an<00:02:43.720> ideas<00:02:44.200> person<00:02:44.830> or

essentially<00:03:16.630> that's<00:03:16.780> what<00:03:16.900> a<00:03:17.230> novelist<00:03:18.070> is

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
essentially that's what a novelist is

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.220 
essentially that's what a novelist is
thinking<00:03:18.640> about<00:03:18.760> every<00:03:19.660> time<00:03:19.840> they<00:03:19.989> sit<00:03:20.200> down

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
thinking about every time they sit down

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.110 
thinking about every time they sit down
to<00:03:20.380> try<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:20.739> write<00:03:20.859> something<00:03:21.100> what<00:03:22.000> about

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
to try and write something what about

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.180 
to try and write something what about
then<00:03:22.420> the<00:03:22.570> idea<00:03:22.900> would<00:03:23.019> create<00:03:23.470> empty<00:03:23.799> for<00:03:24.100> the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
then the idea would create empty for the

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:27.120 
then the idea would create empty for the
sake<00:03:24.489> of<00:03:24.730> creativity<00:03:25.720> for<00:03:26.500> example<00:03:26.890> when<00:03:27.010> you

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
sake of creativity for example when you

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.759 
sake of creativity for example when you

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.550 
google search advertisement copywriting
the<00:03:29.829> word<00:03:30.060> creativity<00:03:31.060> recurs<00:03:31.600> an<00:03:31.900> insane

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
the word creativity recurs an insane

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.860 
the word creativity recurs an insane
amount<00:03:32.709> of<00:03:32.920> time<00:03:33.190> yeah<00:03:33.910> it's<00:03:34.359> a<00:03:34.480> good<00:03:34.660> question

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:34.870 
amount of time yeah it's a good question

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.360 
amount of time yeah it's a good question
and<00:03:35.170> certainly<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:35.799> advertising<00:03:36.310> industry
