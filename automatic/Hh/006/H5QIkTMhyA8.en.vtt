00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.719
 Miami has become the ideal place 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.459
 where to find refuge and of course 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.200
 it was not going to be an exception for those 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:15.660
 young Cuban dancers who 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.830

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.720

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.410

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.100
 all the illusions of the world of 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.300
 take you for a walk that we know 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.930

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.050
 I'm here it's finally going to be my 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.520
 brother to my sister because they have had 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:14.350
 a good to have another brother your brother 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.210
 because I did not have to grow up with him and 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.300
 I have just spent ten days with 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:18.300
 the 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:25.659
 you have family here you do not have anyone 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.360
 not your family in Cuba that is going to say 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:30.909
 when you know that the girl at home is no longer 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.219
 is going to come back to this from the bride 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.359
 It was a little hard now I'm happy but 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.359
 I'm sad at the same time 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:43.480
 that we carry forward everyone to whom 

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.210
 you have here 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.330
 and you left in Cuba my family my mom my 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.490
 sister my uncle I will take me grandmother if I 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:54.410
 I had to tell your mother those 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.850
 words that you could not say because 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:58.010
 you could not tell him you were going to stay 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.690
 there you have the opportunity, you know why 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.000
 what am I here and what I came to do 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.920
 here that I came to improve myself and I'm going to 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.980
 to do it we take a life day my sister 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 my family that will never be missing when 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.900
 time here and here 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.410
 corazoncito is sad for boys 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.080
 now now no 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.620
 who was the one who took the first step who 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.950
 was the guide of this great dream that I say 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.660
 I'm going to do this and who follows me every 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.670
 one of us by individual had 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.110
 thought what I was going to do 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:34.350
 Since I 'm here, nothing says when 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.020
 pass wherever you are when you arrived 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.370
 when we arrived he and I were 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.270
 companions the same room in the 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:45.390
 fourth coming I told him I do not want 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.980
 and he said me neither and well we go 15 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.630
 I grab when he saw that all of you 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.220
 they sent to run and they did not leave 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.800
 nobody back is that we take advantage 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.730
 that had led the delegation to 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.140
 buy a super I do not know 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.780
 we left what we 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.580
 we looked for the passport and when we knew 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.019
 that at ten o'clock they were going to leave at ten o'clock and 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.970
 We are leaving the hotel 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:09.409
 problems none as they manage to catch those 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.000
 passports because I understand that 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:13.910
 you will withdraw passports when 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.870
 they leave to travel will not feel I said no no 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:19.260
 we 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.810
 We said we were going to have June in the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.599
 passports when they go to travel I do not know no 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.549
 I understand it but security if apart it is 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.709
 an identification does not have to have 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.950
 so that no Cuban will not stay no 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:34.860
 it must be in dreams of a dancer 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.200
 is that they leave an island with so much 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:39.450
 repression and they arrive in a country of 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.310
 liberties but that may not have that 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.250
 opportunity that perhaps dreams 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.370
 we came to dances first to 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.890
 the best of one is the most what 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:52.959
 we have always wanted to give and if not 

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:54.819
 can put things to life to work 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.770
 in other thing having freedom we can 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.210
 do everything and having ready we can 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.340
 dance wherever 

00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:03.370
 How true is it that a teacher of 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.500
 you if you felt totally 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.650
 depressed and sad when I knew that already 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.510
 the group was leaving and what those little children 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.700
 that he saw grow up they became names 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.680
 with your own ideals if you are 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.660
 teacher had a lot of closeness with 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.700
 we were master teacher Felix 

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:22.670
 He had a lot of closeness with us 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.500
 we love and support us a lot and it is always 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.570
 so much we understand and that sense 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.920
 He was very sorry for everything that was 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.990
 happening I understand because they are your children 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.240
 as you said you are my children and see that 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:34.550
 they rise to tristan I understand then they 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.900
 it is a bit lonely as soon as our 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.480
 program is an extremely program 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.940
 successful and rent them on the island of Cuba 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.650
 and this is worth money so we will have him 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:46.000
 have to say to all those people that we 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:46.000
 they are going to see a graveyard
