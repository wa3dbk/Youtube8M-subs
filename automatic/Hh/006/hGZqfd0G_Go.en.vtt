00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.760 
muscles so if you have a mix like using
be<00:01:54.130> a<00:01:54.159> lot<00:01:54.310> easier<00:01:55.020> so<00:01:56.020> your<00:01:56.200> sugar<00:01:56.560> and<00:01:56.710> butter

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
be a lot easier so your sugar and butter

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.200 
be a lot easier so your sugar and butter
together<00:01:57.040> should<00:01:57.369> be<00:01:57.460> looking<00:01:57.759> something

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.210 
together should be looking something

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.300 
together should be looking something
like<00:01:58.390> that<00:01:58.659> just<00:01:59.439> the<00:01:59.560> machine<00:01:59.890> you<00:02:00.100> want<00:02:00.189> to

like that just the machine you want to
add<00:02:00.400> in<00:02:00.520> your<00:02:00.549> egg<00:02:04.500> your<00:02:05.500> 1<00:02:05.740> teaspoon<00:02:06.189> of

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
add in your egg your 1 teaspoon of

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.270 
add in your egg your 1 teaspoon of
vanilla<00:02:06.340> extract

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.720 
until just combined don't over mix this
too<00:02:35.500> much<00:02:35.680> and<00:02:35.980> now<00:02:36.069> you're<00:02:36.190> gonna<00:02:36.280> just<00:02:36.549> start

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
too much and now you're gonna just start

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.610 
too much and now you're gonna just start
putting<00:02:37.000> it<00:02:37.090> into<00:02:37.209> your<00:02:37.420> trays<00:02:37.720> there's<00:02:38.260> a<00:02:38.350> few

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
putting it into your trays there's a few

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.380 
putting it into your trays there's a few
different<00:02:38.890> ways<00:02:38.920> you<00:02:39.010> can<00:02:39.280> do<00:02:39.430> this<00:02:39.459> obviously

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
different ways you can do this obviously

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.610 
different ways you can do this obviously
because<00:02:40.630> their<00:02:40.780> mothers<00:02:41.170> they<00:02:41.350> are<00:02:41.410> supposed

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
because their mothers they are supposed

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.170 
because their mothers they are supposed
to<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.799> little<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.310> bigger<00:02:42.700> I<00:02:42.730> kind<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.030> than

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
to be a little bit bigger I kind of than

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.630 
to be a little bit bigger I kind of than
the<00:02:43.209> normal<00:02:43.540> cupcake<00:02:43.989> shapes<00:02:44.290> obviously<00:02:44.830> I<00:02:45.010> do

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
the normal cupcake shapes obviously I do

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.580 
the normal cupcake shapes obviously I do
have<00:02:45.940> a<00:02:45.970> muffin<00:02:46.330> tray<00:02:46.480> here<00:02:46.810> but<00:02:47.290> I've<00:02:47.380> used

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
have a muffin tray here but I've used

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.020 
have a muffin tray here but I've used
this<00:02:47.680> before<00:02:47.739> and<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:48.549> didn't<00:02:48.850> come<00:02:49.000> out

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
this before and they didn't come out

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.090 
this before and they didn't come out
that<00:02:49.690> good<00:02:49.989> to<00:02:50.260> be<00:02:50.350> honest<00:02:50.590> in<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:50.799> muffin

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
that good to be honest in the muffin

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:51.509 
that good to be honest in the muffin
tray

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
tray

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:53.280 
tray
maybe<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:51.910> because<00:02:52.030> this<00:02:52.360> isn't<00:02:52.660> a<00:02:52.900> metal

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
maybe it's because this isn't a metal

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.770 
maybe it's because this isn't a metal
one<00:02:53.500> and<00:02:53.680> but<00:02:54.549> before<00:02:55.030> that<00:02:55.180> I<00:02:55.209> did<00:02:55.480> try<00:02:55.660> it

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
one and but before that I did try it

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.449 
one and but before that I did try it
with<00:02:56.019> just<00:02:56.380> like<00:02:56.620> a<00:02:56.830> cupcake

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
with just like a cupcake

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.870 
with just like a cupcake
train<00:02:58.120> holders<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.200> it<00:03:00.130> worked<00:03:00.400> pretty<00:03:00.609> well

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
train holders and it worked pretty well

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.130 
train holders and it worked pretty well
so<00:03:01.090> it's<00:03:01.209> totally<00:03:01.390> up<00:03:01.600> to<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.840> could<00:03:01.959> use<00:03:02.109> a

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.140 
so it's totally up to you could use a

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.710 
so it's totally up to you could use a
muffin<00:03:02.739> tray<00:03:03.190> or<00:03:03.459> you<00:03:03.549> could<00:03:03.670> use<00:03:03.910> just

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
muffin tray or you could use just

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.180 
muffin tray or you could use just
whatever<00:03:04.870> you<00:03:05.109> kind<00:03:05.350> of<00:03:05.380> make<00:03:05.560> cupcakes<00:03:06.040> in
