part<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.280> constructing<00:01:56.880> a<00:01:57.149> wooly<00:01:57.390> bugger<00:01:57.689> is

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
part of constructing a wooly bugger is

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.770 
part of constructing a wooly bugger is
to<00:01:58.320> attach<00:01:58.920> simply<00:01:59.460> attach<00:01:59.790> your<00:02:00.090> thread<00:02:00.509> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
to attach simply attach your thread to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.450 
to attach simply attach your thread to
your<00:02:01.259> hook<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.799> that's<00:02:01.860> what<00:02:02.040> we're<00:02:02.159> gonna<00:02:02.250> do

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
your hook and that's what we're gonna do

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.030 
your hook and that's what we're gonna do
here<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.939> gonna<00:02:03.030> take<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> couple<00:02:03.600> of<00:02:03.719> wraps

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
here just gonna take a couple of wraps

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:08.660 
here just gonna take a couple of wraps
now<00:02:05.040> every<00:02:05.640> fly<00:02:05.969> generally<00:02:06.930> is<00:02:07.170> built<00:02:07.740> from

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
now every fly generally is built from

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:11.059 
now every fly generally is built from
the<00:02:09.509> rear<00:02:09.720> end<00:02:09.929> out<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.530> we're<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.800> start

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
the rear end out so we're going to start

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.750 
the rear end out so we're going to start
building<00:02:11.489> this<00:02:11.730> fly

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
building this fly

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.830 
building this fly
actually<00:02:14.760> we're<00:02:14.879> gonna<00:02:14.970> put<00:02:15.180> a<00:02:15.209> little<00:02:15.330> LED<00:02:15.660> on

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
actually we're gonna put a little LED on

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.259 
actually we're gonna put a little LED on
here<00:02:16.050> first<00:02:16.819> so<00:02:17.819> I'm<00:02:17.910> gonna<00:02:18.709> take<00:02:19.709> a<00:02:19.769> piece<00:02:20.069> of

see here I'm gonna lay a little bit of

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.410 
see here I'm gonna lay a little bit of
that<00:02:33.060> lead<00:02:33.450> right<00:02:33.750> on<00:02:33.930> top<00:02:34.170> of<00:02:34.319> the<00:02:34.379> hook<00:02:34.560> okay

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:35.420 
that lead right on top of the hook okay

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.979 
that lead right on top of the hook okay
I'm<00:02:36.420> gonna<00:02:36.540> go<00:02:36.720> back<00:02:36.750> to<00:02:37.400> secure<00:02:38.400> that<00:02:38.610> I<00:02:39.000> like

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
I'm gonna go back to secure that I like

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:41.780 
I'm gonna go back to secure that I like
lots<00:02:40.260> of<00:02:40.440> lead<00:02:40.680> because<00:02:40.980> I<00:02:41.010> like<00:02:41.310> my<00:02:41.459> fly<00:02:41.730> to

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
lots of lead because I like my fly to

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.479 
lots of lead because I like my fly to
sink<00:02:42.209> now<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.110> first<00:02:43.769> thing<00:02:43.890> to<00:02:43.980> do<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.310> just

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
sink now the first thing to do is just

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.300 
sink now the first thing to do is just
to<00:02:44.610> wrap<00:02:44.879> the<00:02:45.150> lead<00:02:45.829> around<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:47.489> fly<00:02:49.069> and<00:02:50.069> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
to wrap the lead around the fly and to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.610 
to wrap the lead around the fly and to
do<00:02:50.489> that<00:02:50.640> as<00:02:50.880> tightly<00:02:51.150> as<00:02:51.329> possible<00:02:54.440> you<00:02:55.440> can

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
do that as tightly as possible you can

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.949 
do that as tightly as possible you can
see<00:02:55.829> here<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.400> don't<00:02:57.239> like<00:02:57.390> that<00:02:57.630> I<00:02:57.690> can<00:02:57.870> go<00:02:57.930> back

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
see here I don't like that I can go back

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.449 
see here I don't like that I can go back
good<00:02:58.349> thing<00:02:58.530> about<00:02:58.620> tying<00:02:59.040> is<00:02:59.220> you<00:02:59.280> can<00:02:59.370> go

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
good thing about tying is you can go

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:11.040 
good thing about tying is you can go
back<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:01.170> we're<00:03:01.349> gonna<00:03:01.410> wrap<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:03.230> like<00:03:04.230> so

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:11.050 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:13.260 

I'm<00:03:11.590> gonna<00:03:11.770> keep<00:03:11.890> wrapping<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.490> all<00:03:12.820> the<00:03:13.150> way

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
I'm gonna keep wrapping that all the way

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.380 
I'm gonna keep wrapping that all the way
up<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.840> only<00:03:14.800> used<00:03:15.070> about<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.430> four<00:03:15.850> inch<00:03:16.090> piece

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
up I only used about a four inch piece

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.270 
up I only used about a four inch piece
of<00:03:16.750> lead<00:03:17.400> that's<00:03:18.400> about<00:03:18.640> all<00:03:18.760> you<00:03:18.940> need<00:03:20.280> there

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
we have it okay I'm going to trim that

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.930 
we have it okay I'm going to trim that
lead<00:03:24.490> off<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:26.100> just<00:03:27.100> to<00:03:27.220> make<00:03:27.370> sure<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.580> have<00:03:27.910> it

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
lead off and just to make sure I have it

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.490 
lead off and just to make sure I have it
secure<00:03:28.450> I'm<00:03:28.570> going<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.780> actually<00:03:28.870> wrap<00:03:29.290> over

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
secure I'm going to actually wrap over

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.150 
secure I'm going to actually wrap over
that<00:03:29.800> thread<00:03:30.190> a<00:03:30.370> few<00:03:30.880> times
