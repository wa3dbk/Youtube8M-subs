00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:10.559
 s-class most advanced in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.410
 technological plan car 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.240
 concern daimler besides comfort special 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:23.100
 the role is assigned to environmental friendliness 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:25.050
 we test s500 plug-in hybrid i'm a fan 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.119
 car combines all that 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.760
 can be bought today for money as well 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 luxury and green technology announced 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.809
 that cars with a three-meter wheel 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.640
 base consumes only 3 liters of fuel per 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.640
 100 kilometers now we will check it 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.260
 however, many motorists converge in 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.440
 one any tangible difference from 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.640
 the usual class is still not visible 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.140
 Specialist striking the eye unless 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:57.210
 extended wheelbase 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.210
 however there are other differences 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:13.240
 She learn of course worth noting here 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.800
 this plug-in hybrid label is another 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.560
 the moment of the trunk due to installation 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.690
 the battery has become less volume reduced by 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:24.330
 ninety-six liters in the end left 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.330
 395 liters or so died 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.880
 power of three liters petrol 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:37.490
 engine v6 333 horsepower and if 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.030
 add an electric motor to him 116 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.950
 horses 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.410
 then to total power capacity 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.240
 installation will be about 450 horse 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:48.580
 Forces maximum speed of 250 kilometers 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.229
 at one o'clock 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.229
 acceleration to 100 in five and a half seconds 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.610
 he is feminine as this club we breed 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.620
 the most beautiful in cars with 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.840
 hybrid drive is riding open 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180
 the window when the car is in mode 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 there is practically no noise 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 from time to time you can only hear how 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.780
 another car goes by 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.269
 switching between drives is enough 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.459
 this is easily done with the touch of a button 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.500
 all let's say mental work takes on 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.269
 yourself on-board computer in the end 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.120
 driving is much more convenient 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:37.430
 there is a fully electric mode there is 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.860
 electrical mode energy conservation 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:41.660
 the car saves charge in case 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.060
 you need to get to the city where you can 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.099
 ride only electricity there and 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.450
 mode energy reserves when the engine 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:52.060
 internal combustion charges 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.060
 battery and at the rate of fan species of years 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.190
 whether it is a hybrid s-class or not 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.950
 trim will not leave anyone 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.930
 indifferent two big screens instead 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:06.799
 dashboards provides the driver 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.140
 all the necessary information sit 

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:11.510
 in front of a very, very convenient but 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.720
 provide the greatest comfort rear 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:17.590
 passenger seats plenty of space monitors 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.590
 expensive materials 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.540
 sorption scanner afford such 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.490
 luxury and you can go on electricity 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:31.430
 only extended plug-in hybrid 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:34.220
 on the electric can drive 33 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.130
 kilometer it only sounds a little for 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:39.080
 everyday life is enough german 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:41.540
 on average drives through the city of order 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.840
 forty kilometers that means 20 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.220
 kilometers to work and 20 back 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.590
 battery charging in three hours 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.410
 thus not a drop is required 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:54.470
 gasoline hybrid from class costs about 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:56.930
 108 thousand euros of course that's enough 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:59.180
 a large amount however the same s-class with 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.250
 engine v8 in the extended version costs 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.410
 for example as much as a hybrid 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:07.510
 installation you get almost nothing 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:07.510
 ingrid aktash write 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:15.880
 the s-klasse of the future will soon be convenient 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.630
 not only riding this car on her 

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.630
 charging 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:27.960
 cogs on 7 groups like okay you from the site 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.790
 you are developing a system 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.310
 inductive recharge for serial 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:35.250
 cars is a great option created 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:36.990
 she is solely for comfort is 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:39.660
 means we transfer energy from 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.520
 coils mounted in the garage floor 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.190
 secondary coil which 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.500
 installed in the back of the car, yes . 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.270
 so at the entrance to the garage we 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.460
 will be able to run automatic 

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.890
 recharging the client will not have to 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:55.200
 run around the car spin up 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:57.900
 cable connect it he just drives in 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.640
 in the garage recharging starts by itself 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.530
 about that driver in the morning comes 

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:04.080
 walks into the garage to get in the car 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:08.730
 turns the key and leaves he said he 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:10.830
 rushed from the plug-in hybrid class 

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.790
 combines both comfort and 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.830
 environmental friendliness 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:17.780
 the only negative is reduced volume 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.780
 trunk and bulky battery
