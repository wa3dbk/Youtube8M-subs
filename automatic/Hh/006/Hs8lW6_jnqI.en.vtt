00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
i'm not mistaken i'm not entirely sure

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.790 
i'm not mistaken i'm not entirely sure
if<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.210> been<00:00:54.390> confirmed<00:00:55.140> yet<00:00:55.350> but<00:00:55.500> i

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
if that's been confirmed yet but i
