go<00:01:46.110> right<00:01:46.320> there<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:46.950> that's<00:01:47.790> gonna<00:01:47.970> smoke

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
go right there and that's gonna smoke

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.160 
go right there and that's gonna smoke
off<00:01:48.659> the<00:01:48.960> connector<00:01:49.729> right<00:01:52.850> there

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
off the connector right there

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.340 
off the connector right there
next<00:01:56.170> important<00:01:56.650> feature<00:01:56.830> of<00:01:56.980> the<00:01:57.130> strata<00:01:58.350> get

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
next important feature of the strata get

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.650 
next important feature of the strata get
down<00:01:59.560> here<00:01:59.860> is<00:02:00.010> that<00:02:00.670> the<00:02:00.850> booster<00:02:01.270> needs<00:02:01.510> to

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:01.660 
down here is that the booster needs to

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:03.480 
down here is that the booster needs to
stand<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:02.260> middle<00:02:02.290> of<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.770> box<00:02:03.040> not<00:02:03.340> in

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:03.490 
stand in the middle of the box not in

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.330 
stand in the middle of the box not in
the<00:02:03.610> very<00:02:03.820> left<00:02:04.060> hand<00:02:04.300> side<00:02:04.600> because<00:02:05.200> you<00:02:06.190> want

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
the very left hand side because you want

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.830 
the very left hand side because you want
your<00:02:06.460> teammates<00:02:06.820> jumping<00:02:07.240> on<00:02:07.330> the<00:02:07.420> right<00:02:07.630> side

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840 
your teammates jumping on the right side

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.630 
your teammates jumping on the right side
of<00:02:07.990> your<00:02:08.020> body<00:02:08.320> in<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.950> left<00:02:09.190> side<00:02:09.460> of<00:02:09.580> your

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
of your body in the left side of your

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.120 
of your body in the left side of your
body<00:02:09.850> so<00:02:10.720> that<00:02:10.869> two<00:02:11.140> people<00:02:11.380> can<00:02:11.650> get<00:02:11.800> boosted

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
body so that two people can get boosted

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.090 
body so that two people can get boosted
up<00:02:12.250> as<00:02:12.370> well<00:02:12.610> boost<00:02:13.150> it<00:02:13.300> up<00:02:13.360> at<00:02:13.570> once<00:02:14.070> so<00:02:15.070> you

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
up as well boost it up at once so you

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.710 
up as well boost it up at once so you
know<00:02:15.250> two<00:02:15.310> teammates<00:02:16.000> are<00:02:16.240> flinging<00:02:16.600> up

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
know two teammates are flinging up

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:17.910 
know two teammates are flinging up
because<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.020> want<00:02:17.140> to<00:02:17.230> boost<00:02:17.470> these<00:02:17.560> people

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
because you want to boost these people

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.560 
because you want to boost these people
as<00:02:18.040> fast<00:02:18.340> as<00:02:18.610> possible<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.240> don't<00:02:19.300> want<00:02:19.510> to

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
as fast as possible you don't want to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.440 
as fast as possible you don't want to
boost<00:02:19.720> one<00:02:20.020> then<00:02:20.740> one<00:02:21.010> then<00:02:21.640> one<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:22.240> want<00:02:22.390> to

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
boost one then one then one you want to

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.150 
boost one then one then one you want to
do<00:02:22.510> it<00:02:22.570> as<00:02:22.660> fast<00:02:22.930> as<00:02:23.080> possible<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:23.650> boosting

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
do it as fast as possible so boosting

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.820 
do it as fast as possible so boosting
two<00:02:24.370> at<00:02:24.520> once<00:02:24.760> is<00:02:24.940> very<00:02:25.210> crucial<00:02:25.510> here<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:26.290> we

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
two at once is very crucial here and we

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:28.620 
two at once is very crucial here and we
don't<00:02:26.950> do<00:02:27.100> it<00:02:27.220> that<00:02:27.459> well<00:02:27.670> I<00:02:27.730> think<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.240> jump<00:02:28.510> on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
don't do it that well I think I jump on

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.030 
don't do it that well I think I jump on
the<00:02:28.720> right<00:02:28.870> side<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.290> then<00:02:29.380> Kevin<00:02:29.709> kind<00:02:29.950> of

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
the right side and then Kevin kind of

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:32.090 
the right side and then Kevin kind of
jumps<00:02:30.310> in<00:02:30.400> the<00:02:30.459> middle<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.910> Fatty's<00:02:31.300> it<00:02:31.450> up

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
jumps in the middle and Fatty's it up

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.610 
jumps in the middle and Fatty's it up
but<00:02:33.100> um<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.730> think<00:02:34.420> nitrogen<00:02:35.020> swag<00:02:35.260> get<00:02:35.530> it

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
but um I think nitrogen swag get it

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.780 
but um I think nitrogen swag get it
there<00:02:35.770> at<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:35.950> end<00:02:36.070> and<00:02:36.220> boost<00:02:36.400> up<00:02:36.580> together

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
there at the end and boost up together

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.880 
there at the end and boost up together
so<00:02:37.920> Kevin<00:02:38.920> kind<00:02:39.100> of<00:02:39.190> fatty<00:02:39.430> Nick<00:02:40.150> off<00:02:40.360> there

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
so Kevin kind of fatty Nick off there

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.650 
so Kevin kind of fatty Nick off there
Nick<00:02:41.890> jumps<00:02:42.190> up<00:02:42.340> prax's<00:02:42.820> like<00:02:42.940> yo<00:02:43.120> I'm<00:02:43.390> getting

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
Nick jumps up prax's like yo I'm getting

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.229 
Nick jumps up prax's like yo I'm getting
on<00:02:43.720> there<00:02:43.900> too<00:02:44.220> those<00:02:45.220> guys<00:02:45.430> both<00:02:45.700> get<00:02:45.880> boosted

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
on there too those guys both get boosted

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.150 
on there too those guys both get boosted
together<00:02:46.540> nice<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.230> we<00:02:47.620> have<00:02:47.650> four<00:02:47.980> people

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160 
together nice and we have four people

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.150 
together nice and we have four people
already<00:02:48.550> up<00:02:48.730> on<00:02:48.880> here<00:02:49.500> what<00:02:50.500> I<00:02:50.530> end<00:02:50.830> up<00:02:50.980> doing

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
already up on here what I end up doing

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.100 
already up on here what I end up doing
is<00:02:51.459> jumping<00:02:51.760> on<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.330> little<00:02:52.570> pillow<00:02:52.810> right

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
is jumping on the little pillow right

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:54.990 
is jumping on the little pillow right
here<00:02:53.170> at<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:53.680> little<00:02:53.920> not<00:02:54.580> even<00:02:54.760> sure<00:02:54.850> what

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
here at the little not even sure what

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.260 
here at the little not even sure what
that<00:02:55.030> is<00:02:55.150> on<00:02:55.360> the<00:02:55.450> side<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.810> wall<00:02:57.270> we'll

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
that is on the side of the wall we'll

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.350 
that is on the side of the wall we'll
take<00:02:58.450> a<00:02:58.480> look<00:02:58.690> at<00:02:58.810> me<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.940> so<00:03:00.940> I<00:03:00.970> end<00:03:01.239> up

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
take a look at me and so I end up

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.280 
take a look at me and so I end up
jumping<00:03:01.660> on<00:03:02.080> this<00:03:02.410> platform<00:03:02.739> here<00:03:03.670> I<00:03:04.290> think

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
jumping on this platform here I think

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.259 
jumping on this platform here I think
one<00:03:05.500> teammate<00:03:05.860> followed<00:03:06.220> me<00:03:06.370> follows<00:03:07.030> me<00:03:07.180> as

00:03:07.259 --> 00:03:07.269 
one teammate followed me follows me as

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:10.170 
one teammate followed me follows me as
well<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:08.769> know<00:03:08.890> VP<00:03:09.370> is<00:03:09.430> actually<00:03:09.850> stacked

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
well and you know VP is actually stacked

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:11.699 
well and you know VP is actually stacked
for<00:03:10.360> this<00:03:10.450> they<00:03:10.630> have<00:03:10.720> three<00:03:11.080> people<00:03:11.110> in<00:03:11.560> the

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:11.709 
for this they have three people in the

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:13.789 
for this they have three people in the
connector<00:03:12.190> and<00:03:12.430> we<00:03:12.640> actually<00:03:12.970> end<00:03:13.150> up<00:03:13.239> doing

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
connector and we actually end up doing

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:18.060 
connector and we actually end up doing
pretty<00:03:14.799> well<00:03:14.920> here<00:03:16.260> also<00:03:17.260> sitting<00:03:17.739> here<00:03:17.920> we

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
pretty well here also sitting here we

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:21.000 
pretty well here also sitting here we
kind<00:03:18.340> of<00:03:18.430> just<00:03:18.580> all<00:03:18.760> Rambo<00:03:19.630> out<00:03:20.019> as<00:03:20.320> fast<00:03:20.680> as<00:03:20.860> we

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
kind of just all Rambo out as fast as we

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:23.789 
kind of just all Rambo out as fast as we
can<00:03:21.250> skadoodle<00:03:22.000> ends<00:03:22.900> up<00:03:22.989> dying<00:03:23.230> here<00:03:23.560> but<00:03:23.739> he

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
can skadoodle ends up dying here but he

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.759 
can skadoodle ends up dying here but he
gets<00:03:23.950> that<00:03:24.160> information<00:03:24.850> for<00:03:25.060> us<00:03:25.120> and<00:03:25.620> we<00:03:26.620> go

00:03:26.759 --> 00:03:26.769 
gets that information for us and we go

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.960 
gets that information for us and we go
through<00:03:26.980> this<00:03:27.100> choke<00:03:27.400> point<00:03:27.640> here<00:03:27.820> we

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
through this choke point here we

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:30.030 
through this choke point here we
continue<00:03:28.570> to<00:03:28.720> hold<00:03:28.900> w<00:03:29.320> we<00:03:29.470> jump<00:03:29.769> around<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
continue to hold w we jump around the

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.130 
continue to hold w we jump around the
corner<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:30.519> just<00:03:30.730> try<00:03:30.910> to<00:03:30.970> overwhelm<00:03:31.390> the<00:03:31.660> CTS

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
corner we just try to overwhelm the CTS

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.130 
corner we just try to overwhelm the CTS
I<00:03:32.549> think<00:03:33.549> we<00:03:33.640> end<00:03:33.820> up<00:03:33.940> douching<00:03:34.450> Pasha<00:03:34.720> they

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
I think we end up douching Pasha they
