00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.420 
route and we'll take a look at that here
in<00:01:24.240> just<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.509> bit<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.900> then<00:01:25.619> over<00:01:26.070> here<00:01:26.130> we're

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
in just a bit and then over here we're

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.249 
in just a bit and then over here we're
gonna<00:01:26.520> have<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> fullback<00:01:27.299> now<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.659> fullback

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
gonna have the fullback now the fullback

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.679 
gonna have the fullback now the fullback
he<00:01:28.680> runs<00:01:29.009> a<00:01:29.340> corner<00:01:29.909> route<00:01:30.060> which<00:01:30.270> essentially

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
he runs a corner route which essentially

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.999 
he runs a corner route which essentially
turns<00:01:30.930> into<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.170> corner<00:01:31.439> round<00:01:31.590> he<00:01:31.680> goes<00:01:31.710> into

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
turns into a corner round he goes into

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.280 
turns into a corner round he goes into
this<00:01:32.100> area<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.180> he<00:01:33.360> goes<00:01:33.540> up<00:01:33.780> about<00:01:33.990> 10

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
this area here and he goes up about 10

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.899 
this area here and he goes up about 10
to<00:01:34.380> 12<00:01:34.560> yards<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.130> he<00:01:35.189> winds<00:01:35.520> up<00:01:35.610> breaking

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
to 12 yards and he winds up breaking

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.420 
to 12 yards and he winds up breaking
towards<00:01:36.329> the<00:01:36.479> corner<00:01:36.900> he's<00:01:37.530> another<00:01:37.920> option

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
towards the corner he's another option

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.370 
towards the corner he's another option
you<00:01:38.520> can<00:01:38.549> throw<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.479> one<00:01:39.990> of<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.170> things

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
you can throw to and one of the things

you can throw to and one of the things
you<00:01:40.560> may<00:01:40.770> consider<00:01:41.159> doing<00:01:41.430> with<00:01:41.820> this<00:01:42.000> play<00:01:42.360> is

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
you may consider doing with this play is

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.230 
you may consider doing with this play is
putting<00:01:43.710> or<00:01:43.890> subbing<00:01:44.399> here<00:01:44.640> rather<00:01:44.970> be<00:01:45.210> a

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
putting or subbing here rather be a

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.170 
putting or subbing here rather be a
package<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.869> sub<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.680> him<00:01:46.920> with<00:01:47.460> a<00:01:47.490> faster

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
package or sub in him with a faster

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.969 
package or sub in him with a faster
halfback<00:01:48.659> so<00:01:48.840> if<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.140> fast<00:01:49.439> halfback

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
halfback so if you got a fast halfback

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.530 
halfback so if you got a fast halfback
who's<00:01:50.159> not<00:01:50.340> out<00:01:50.520> on<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.700> field<00:01:50.970> such<00:01:51.270> as<00:01:51.299> your

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
number-two out back on the depth chart
you<00:01:53.700> may<00:01:53.729> want<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> go<00:01:54.149> ahead<00:01:54.210> and<00:01:54.420> put<00:01:54.600> him<00:01:54.689> in

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
you may want to go ahead and put him in

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.569 
you may want to go ahead and put him in
there<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.140> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.470> open<00:01:55.619> as<00:01:55.950> he<00:01:56.399> breaks

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
there so you can get open as he breaks

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
there so you can get open as he breaks
towards<00:01:56.909> the<00:01:56.969> corner<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:57.450> consider<00:01:57.780> doing

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
towards the corner so consider doing

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.749 
towards the corner so consider doing
that<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.409> then<00:01:58.860> to<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.130> outside<00:01:59.159> of<00:01:59.520> all

that and then to the outside of all
these<00:01:59.909> receivers<00:02:00.390> we<00:02:00.869> have<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.229> flanker<00:02:01.619> he's

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
these receivers we have the flanker he's

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.080 
these receivers we have the flanker he's
going<00:02:01.920> to<00:02:01.979> go<00:02:02.100> ahead<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.340> run<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.670> route<00:02:02.909> now

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
going to go ahead and run a go route now

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.490 
going to go ahead and run a go route now
keep<00:02:03.270> in<00:02:03.420> mind<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.780> particular<00:02:04.020> formation

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
keep in mind this particular formation

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.800 
keep in mind this particular formation
he<00:02:04.770> acts<00:02:04.920> he<00:02:05.130> lines<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.549> tighter<00:02:05.850> than<00:02:06.000> what<00:02:06.719> he

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
he acts he lines up tighter than what he

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.210 
he acts he lines up tighter than what he
normally<00:02:06.960> would<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.680> just<00:02:07.829> keep<00:02:08.009> that<00:02:08.039> in

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
normally would do so just keep that in

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.589 
normally would do so just keep that in
mind<00:02:08.310> rather<00:02:08.670> than<00:02:08.819> in<00:02:08.879> line<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.209> outside

mind rather than in line and outside

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.300 
mind rather than in line and outside
here<00:02:09.929> for<00:02:10.229> example<00:02:10.709> let's<00:02:10.830> kind<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.039> just<00:02:11.190> take

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
here for example let's kind of just take

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.839 
here for example let's kind of just take
a<00:02:11.340> look<00:02:11.459> at<00:02:11.580> this

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:11.849 
a look at this

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:13.550 
a look at this
he<00:02:12.360> doesn't<00:02:12.599> line<00:02:12.720> up<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:12.989> here<00:02:13.020> he<00:02:13.319> actually

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
he doesn't line up out here he actually

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:13.820 
he doesn't line up out here he actually
lines

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
lines

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.350 
lines
more<00:02:14.070> compressed<00:02:14.490> more<00:02:14.730> tight<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.150> you<00:02:15.240> want

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
more compressed more tight if you want

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:17.210 
more compressed more tight if you want
to<00:02:15.420> call<00:02:15.570> off<00:02:15.780> that<00:02:15.810> and<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.680> he<00:02:16.770> lines<00:02:16.950> up<00:02:17.130> in

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
to call off that and so he lines up in

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.620 
to call off that and so he lines up in
this<00:02:17.310> area<00:02:17.550> here<00:02:17.670> and<00:02:17.970> he<00:02:18.030> goes<00:02:18.180> head<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.480> runs

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
this area here and he goes head and runs

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.290 
this area here and he goes head and runs
that<00:02:18.780> go<00:02:19.230> route<00:02:19.500> so<00:02:19.880> he<00:02:20.880> have<00:02:20.970> some<00:02:21.150> nice

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
that go route so he have some nice

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.730 
that go route so he have some nice
routes<00:02:21.540> to<00:02:21.750> run<00:02:21.900> with<00:02:22.020> this<00:02:22.080> particular<00:02:22.320> play

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
routes to run with this particular play

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.440 
routes to run with this particular play
now<00:02:23.400> let's<00:02:23.730> go<00:02:23.820> and<00:02:23.910> take<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.090> look<00:02:24.240> at<00:02:24.360> the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
now let's go and take a look at the

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
now let's go and take a look at the
defense<00:02:24.690> that<00:02:24.900> we're<00:02:25.020> gonna<00:02:25.110> run<00:02:25.350> this

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
defense that we're gonna run this

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.750 
defense that we're gonna run this
against<00:02:25.770> which<00:02:25.920> happens<00:02:26.220> to<00:02:26.310> be<00:02:26.370> two<00:02:26.580> man

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
against which happens to be two man

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.610 
against which happens to be two man
under<00:02:27.030> believe<00:02:27.360> this<00:02:27.480> is<00:02:27.630> the<00:02:27.720> 4-3<00:02:28.140> stack<00:02:28.410> two

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
under believe this is the 4-3 stack two

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.020 
under believe this is the 4-3 stack two
man<00:02:28.770> under<00:02:29.010> that<00:02:29.130> we're<00:02:29.250> showing<00:02:29.580> us<00:02:29.700> against

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
man under that we're showing us against

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.090 
man under that we're showing us against
as<00:02:30.210> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.080> you<00:02:31.200> wind<00:02:31.410> up<00:02:31.560> having<00:02:31.710> five

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
as you can see you wind up having five

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.830 
as you can see you wind up having five
defenders<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:32.790> man<00:02:32.910> coverage<00:02:33.270> two<00:02:33.480> defenders

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.360 
the left such as you see on your screen
there<00:02:48.840> so<00:02:48.870> you<00:02:49.500> can<00:02:49.650> see<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:49.980> there<00:02:50.220> he's

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
going to go out there and the reason we

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.420 
going to go out there and the reason we
do<00:02:51.780> that<00:02:51.810> is<00:02:51.959> for<00:02:52.260> three<00:02:52.440> reasons<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:53.010> we<00:02:53.280> want

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
do that is for three reasons a we want

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.060 
do that is for three reasons a we want
to<00:02:53.520> cancel<00:02:53.700> to<00:02:53.940> play<00:02:54.150> action<00:02:54.420> two<00:02:55.230> we<00:02:55.830> want<00:02:56.010> to

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
to cancel to play action two we want to

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.710 
to cancel to play action two we want to
go<00:02:56.190> ahead<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.400> draw<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:56.940> defender<00:02:57.570> that's

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
go ahead and draw the defender that's

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.949 
go ahead and draw the defender that's
covering<00:02:58.140> him<00:02:58.320> away<00:02:58.800> from<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.450> pass<00:03:00.720> coverage

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
covering him away from the pass coverage

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:02.360 
covering him away from the pass coverage
is<00:03:01.200> over<00:03:01.410> the<00:03:01.500> short<00:03:01.709> middle<00:03:01.890> of<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.010> field<00:03:02.220> so

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
is over the short middle of the field so

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.730 
is over the short middle of the field so
we<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.700> go<00:03:02.910> ahead<00:03:02.940> and<00:03:03.150> find<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:04.290> split<00:03:04.590> in

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:04.740 
we can go ahead and find the split in

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.500 
we can go ahead and find the split in
open<00:03:05.070> for<00:03:05.280> example<00:03:05.790> here's<00:03:06.180> the<00:03:06.330> halfback

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
open for example here's the halfback

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
open for example here's the halfback
he's<00:03:06.900> coming<00:03:07.200> out<00:03:07.320> in<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.530> area<00:03:07.740> here<00:03:07.980> now

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
he's coming out in this area here now

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.949 
he's coming out in this area here now
the<00:03:08.730> defender<00:03:09.240> is<00:03:09.360> actually<00:03:09.600> going<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.780> wind

00:03:09.949 --> 00:03:09.959 
the defender is actually going to wind

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:11.840 
the defender is actually going to wind
up<00:03:10.110> covering<00:03:10.530> him<00:03:10.650> covering<00:03:10.800> him<00:03:11.250> it's<00:03:11.670> gonna

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
up covering him covering him it's gonna

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.340 
up covering him covering him it's gonna
be<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.180> believe<00:03:12.360> it's<00:03:12.780> going<00:03:12.870> to<00:03:12.930> be<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.170> right

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
be I believe it's going to be the right

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.930 
be I believe it's going to be the right
outside<00:03:13.680> linebacker<00:03:13.740> where<00:03:14.430> he<00:03:14.550> comes<00:03:14.790> in

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
outside linebacker where he comes in

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.210 
outside linebacker where he comes in
this<00:03:15.030> area<00:03:15.300> here<00:03:15.480> and<00:03:15.570> covers<00:03:15.870> him<00:03:16.020> by<00:03:16.860> getting

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
this area here and covers him by getting

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.800 
this area here and covers him by getting
him<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.580> go<00:03:17.700> out<00:03:17.850> there<00:03:18.060> to<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.330> outside<00:03:18.780> to

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
him to go out there to the outside to

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.199 
him to go out there to the outside to
cover<00:03:19.170> him<00:03:19.440> and<00:03:19.680> then<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.519> that's<00:03:20.730> gonna<00:03:20.910> do

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
cover him and then what that's gonna do

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.540 
cover him and then what that's gonna do
is<00:03:21.450> it's<00:03:21.480> gonna<00:03:21.840> clear<00:03:22.350> out<00:03:22.590> anything<00:03:23.160> over

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
is it's gonna clear out anything over

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.160

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
the field in this area here that's the

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.860 
the field in this area here that's the
reason<00:03:26.910> that<00:03:26.940> we<00:03:27.150> do<00:03:27.269> that<00:03:27.390> we<00:03:27.510> don't<00:03:27.690> want<00:03:27.840> to

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
reason that we do that we don't want to

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.960 
reason that we do that we don't want to
have<00:03:27.989> any<00:03:28.230> defenders<00:03:28.769> over<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.190> middle<00:03:29.910> of

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
have any defenders over the middle of

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.540 
have any defenders over the middle of
the<00:03:30.030> field<00:03:30.209> that<00:03:31.050> can<00:03:31.410> make<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> break<00:03:32.280> on<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
the field that can make a break on the

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.220 
the field that can make a break on the
ball<00:03:32.760> or<00:03:32.910> try<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.150> pick<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> pass<00:03:33.720> off<00:03:33.959> that's

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
ball or try to pick the pass off that's

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:35.870 
ball or try to pick the pass off that's
the<00:03:34.320> reason<00:03:34.590> that<00:03:34.620> we're<00:03:34.830> doing<00:03:34.860> that<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:35.640> I

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
the reason that we're doing that so I

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.400 
the reason that we're doing that so I
want<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.239> guys<00:03:36.390> understand<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.170> one<00:03:37.350> of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
want you guys understand that's one of

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.410 
want you guys understand that's one of
the<00:03:37.470> reasons<00:03:37.830> and<00:03:38.640> then<00:03:38.790> the<00:03:38.910> other<00:03:39.060> reason

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:39.420 
the reasons and then the other reason

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.320 
the reasons and then the other reason
for<00:03:39.450> it<00:03:39.840> is<00:03:40.220> if<00:03:41.220> our<00:03:41.430> opponent<00:03:41.670> was<00:03:42.000> to<00:03:42.150> call

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
for it is if our opponent was to call

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:43.970 
for it is if our opponent was to call
some<00:03:42.570> type<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.780> blitz<00:03:43.170> for<00:03:43.380> example<00:03:43.800> maybe

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
some type of blitz for example maybe

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.530 
some type of blitz for example maybe
that's<00:03:44.130> right<00:03:44.280> outside<00:03:44.400> linebacker<00:03:44.580> blitzes

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
that's right outside linebacker blitzes

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.930 
that's right outside linebacker blitzes
and<00:03:45.660> then<00:03:46.350> this<00:03:46.769> safety<00:03:47.160> up<00:03:47.310> here<00:03:47.489> would<00:03:47.610> wind

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
and then this safety up here would wind

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.910 
and then this safety up here would wind
up<00:03:48.000> covering<00:03:48.510> and<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.870> halfback<00:03:49.320> as<00:03:49.650> he<00:03:49.739> comes

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
up covering and the halfback as he comes

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.920 
up covering and the halfback as he comes
out<00:03:50.040> of<00:03:50.130> the<00:03:50.220> backfield<00:03:50.400> if<00:03:51.300> we<00:03:51.480> feel<00:03:51.660> like<00:03:51.780> we

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
out of the backfield if we feel like we

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:53.600 
out of the backfield if we feel like we
don't<00:03:52.080> have<00:03:52.230> enough<00:03:52.620> time<00:03:52.860> to<00:03:52.920> wait<00:03:53.340> for<00:03:53.489> one

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
don't have enough time to wait for one

don't have enough time to wait for one
other<00:03:53.730> receivers<00:03:54.209> to<00:03:54.300> get<00:03:54.420> open<00:03:54.750> then<00:03:55.470> we<00:03:55.709> can

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
other receivers to get open then we can

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:57.350 
other receivers to get open then we can
simply<00:03:56.280> just<00:03:56.430> go<00:03:56.580> ahead<00:03:56.640> and<00:03:56.880> dump<00:03:57.030> the<00:03:57.180> pass

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
allowed the running back to try to go

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.820 
allowed the running back to try to go
ahead<00:04:00.480> and<00:04:00.690> maybe<00:04:00.780> break<00:04:01.080> a<00:04:01.140> tackle<00:04:01.380> or<00:04:01.620> two

and<00:04:02.070> then<00:04:02.400> head<00:04:02.550> up<00:04:02.670> the<00:04:02.760> field<00:04:02.940> and<00:04:03.030> pick<00:04:03.150> up

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
and then head up the field and pick up

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:04.729 
and then head up the field and pick up
some<00:04:03.360> positive<00:04:03.690> yardage<00:04:03.959> so<00:04:04.410> those<00:04:04.560> are<00:04:04.680> the

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
some positive yardage so those are the

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.290 
some positive yardage so those are the
three<00:04:04.920> reasons<00:04:05.280> that<00:04:05.459> we<00:04:05.610> run<00:04:05.760> this<00:04:05.910> play<00:04:06.150> as

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
three reasons that we run this play as

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:07.520 
three reasons that we run this play as
far<00:04:06.480> as<00:04:06.600> with<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.810> hot<00:04:06.989> route<00:04:07.200> of<00:04:07.410> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
far as with the hot route of the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.780 
far as with the hot route of the
halfback<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.980> just<00:04:08.220> wanted<00:04:08.400> to<00:04:08.459> point<00:04:08.580> that<00:04:08.700> out

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
halfback I just wanted to point that out

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:10.850 
halfback I just wanted to point that out
to<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.150> so<00:04:09.959> this<00:04:10.080> is<00:04:10.140> what<00:04:10.290> the<00:04:10.380> play<00:04:10.560> looks

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
to you so this is what the play looks

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.080 
to you so this is what the play looks
like<00:04:11.100> and<00:04:11.340> once<00:04:11.459> we<00:04:11.580> make<00:04:11.610> all<00:04:11.940> those

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
like and once we make all those

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.130 
like and once we make all those
adjustments<00:04:12.239> or<00:04:12.660> at<00:04:12.720> least<00:04:12.840> that<00:04:12.959> one

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
adjustments or at least that one

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.159 
adjustments or at least that one
pre-snap<00:04:13.440> adjustment<00:04:14.160> as<00:04:14.310> you<00:04:15.239> can<00:04:15.390> see<00:04:15.600> you

00:04:16.159 --> 00:04:16.169 
pre-snap adjustment as you can see you

00:04:16.169 --> 00:04:17.750 
pre-snap adjustment as you can see you
really<00:04:16.410> look<00:04:16.590> at<00:04:16.739> it<00:04:16.950> over<00:04:17.280> here<00:04:17.609> in<00:04:17.700> the

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
really look at it over here in the

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.590 
really look at it over here in the
middle<00:04:17.880> of<00:04:18.030> the<00:04:18.090> field<00:04:18.269> is<00:04:18.359> what<00:04:18.450> I<00:04:18.479> was

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
middle of the field is what I was

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.580 
middle of the field is what I was
talking<00:04:18.810> about<00:04:18.840> earlier<00:04:19.229> with<00:04:19.380> the<00:04:19.440> halfback

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
talking about earlier with the halfback

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.830 
talking about earlier with the halfback
there's<00:04:20.100> nobody<00:04:20.519> in<00:04:20.669> this<00:04:20.790> area<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.359> far<00:04:21.419> as

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
there's nobody in this area as far as

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.300 
there's nobody in this area as far as
going<00:04:22.080> to<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.289> anywhere<00:04:22.650> in<00:04:22.770> you're<00:04:22.919> trying<00:04:23.160> to

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
going to be anywhere in you're trying to

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.100 
going to be anywhere in you're trying to
guard<00:04:23.490> us<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.850> that's<00:04:24.390> the<00:04:24.510> reason<00:04:24.750> as<00:04:24.840> I<00:04:24.930> said

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
guard us and that's the reason as I said

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.190 
guard us and that's the reason as I said
before<00:04:25.229> that<00:04:25.500> we<00:04:25.650> won<00:04:25.800> two<00:04:25.919> hot

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.200 
before that we won two hot

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.050 
before that we won two hot
the<00:04:26.380> halfback<00:04:26.710> on<00:04:26.860> that<00:04:27.010> swing<00:04:27.250> route<00:04:27.400> so

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
the halfback on that swing route so

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:29.400 
the halfback on that swing route so
that's<00:04:28.450> the<00:04:28.630> play<00:04:28.840> right<00:04:29.050> there<00:04:29.230> in<00:04:29.350> a

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
that's the play right there in a

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.960 
that's the play right there in a
nutshell<00:04:29.530> as<00:04:29.920> far<00:04:30.130> as<00:04:30.250> how<00:04:30.370> we're<00:04:30.550> gonna<00:04:30.610> run

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
nutshell as far as how we're gonna run

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.550 
nutshell as far as how we're gonna run
this<00:04:31.150> one<00:04:31.750> of<00:04:31.840> the<00:04:31.900> other<00:04:32.050> things<00:04:32.230> I<00:04:32.320> do<00:04:32.380> want

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
this one of the other things I do want

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.130 
this one of the other things I do want
to<00:04:32.650> point<00:04:32.860> out<00:04:33.040> is<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.700> split<00:04:34.450> in<00:04:34.600> as<00:04:34.780> he<00:04:34.960> runs

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
to point out is the split in as he runs

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.140 
to point out is the split in as he runs
this<00:04:35.380> route<00:04:35.620> inside<00:04:36.070> here<00:04:36.340> initially<00:04:36.850> he<00:04:37.000> does

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
this route inside here initially he does

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.610 
this route inside here initially he does
not<00:04:37.270> get<00:04:37.510> jammed<00:04:37.750> by<00:04:37.900> the<00:04:37.960> corner<00:04:38.350> so<00:04:38.500> this

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
not get jammed by the corner so this

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:40.470 
not get jammed by the corner so this
corner<00:04:39.040> out<00:04:39.070> here<00:04:39.430> which<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.210> the<00:04:40.300> right

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:40.480 
corner out here which is the right

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.540

corner<00:04:40.810> is<00:04:40.870> not<00:04:40.990> going<00:04:41.230> to<00:04:41.290> jam<00:04:41.530> him<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.040> it's

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
corner is not going to jam him and it's

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:43.590 
corner is not going to jam him and it's
kind<00:04:42.700> of<00:04:42.730> go<00:04:42.820> back<00:04:42.940> over<00:04:43.210> just<00:04:43.240> a<00:04:43.390> little<00:04:43.420> bit
