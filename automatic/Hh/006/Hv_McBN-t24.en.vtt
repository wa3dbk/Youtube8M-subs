00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.390 

I<00:00:03.350> think<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.410> best<00:00:04.560> part<00:00:04.740> about<00:00:04.859> traveling

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:05.400 
I think the best part about traveling

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.889 
I think the best part about traveling
and<00:00:05.520> snow<00:00:05.640> warning<00:00:05.970> is<00:00:06.150> just<00:00:06.390> the<00:00:06.540> fact<00:00:06.810> that

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
and snow warning is just the fact that

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.900 
and snow warning is just the fact that
like<00:00:07.200> you<00:00:07.649> know<00:00:07.680> what<00:00:07.919> to<00:00:08.040> experience<00:00:08.580> life

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
like you know what to experience life

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.120 
like you know what to experience life
experience<00:00:09.080> you<00:00:10.080> carve<00:00:10.320> your<00:00:10.469> own<00:00:10.530> path<00:00:10.650> you

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
experience you carve your own path you

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.890 
experience you carve your own path you
know<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.460> so<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.000> think<00:00:12.330> that's<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:12.719> biggest

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
know and so I think that's the biggest

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.160 
know and so I think that's the biggest
thing<00:00:13.049> for<00:00:13.139> me<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.410> the<00:00:13.590> experience
