better<00:02:25.370> than<00:02:25.519> practice<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.650> changed<00:02:27.650> something

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:27.799 
better than practice I changed something

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:29.740 
better than practice I changed something
again<00:02:28.129> for<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.370> practice<00:02:28.790> and<00:02:29.000> was<00:02:29.150> happier

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
again for that practice and was happier

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.089 
again for that practice and was happier
again<00:02:30.080> so<00:02:30.349> hopefully<00:02:30.709> if<00:02:30.769> I<00:02:30.860> can<00:02:30.980> keep

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
again so hopefully if I can keep

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.520 
again so hopefully if I can keep
progressing<00:02:31.970> it<00:02:32.450> should<00:02:32.599> be<00:02:32.690> get<00:02:32.810> a<00:02:32.840> thinker<00:02:33.200> I

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
progressing it should be get a thinker I

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.039 
progressing it should be get a thinker I

some all good runs in today yeah that's
a<00:02:46.069> good<00:02:46.160> thing<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.430> mean<00:02:46.579> it's<00:02:46.700> good<00:02:46.790> in<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.970> way

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
a good thing I mean it's good in a way

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.699 
a good thing I mean it's good in a way
because<00:02:47.329> obviously<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:48.200> only<00:02:48.230> came<00:02:48.500> in

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
because obviously you only came in

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.920 
because obviously you only came in
Tuesday<00:02:49.010> you<00:02:49.340> can<00:02:49.489> afford<00:02:49.700> to<00:02:49.819> have<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> try<00:02:50.900> a

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
Tuesday you can afford to have a try a

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:51.819 
Tuesday you can afford to have a try a
couple<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.260> things<00:02:51.380> you<00:02:51.560> wouldn't<00:02:51.739> normally

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
couple of things you wouldn't normally

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.309 
couple of things you wouldn't normally
try

00:02:53.309 --> 00:02:53.319 
try

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:55.080 
try
on<00:02:53.890> the<00:02:54.010> other<00:02:54.099> hand<00:02:54.340> it<00:02:54.459> makes<00:02:54.579> our<00:02:54.730> harder<00:02:54.969> to

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
on the other hand it makes our harder to

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.179 
on the other hand it makes our harder to
make<00:02:55.209> the<00:02:55.299> funnel<00:02:55.480> into<00:02:55.749> stores<00:02:56.170> so<00:02:56.439> I<00:02:56.680> think

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:57.189 
make the funnel into stores so I think

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:58.559 
make the funnel into stores so I think
it<00:02:57.340> depends<00:02:57.579> at<00:02:57.730> your<00:02:57.819> qualifying<00:02:58.180> goes<00:02:58.389> if

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
it depends at your qualifying goes if

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.690 
it depends at your qualifying goes if
two<00:02:59.379> scores<00:02:59.680> can<00:02:59.859> work<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.159> well<00:03:00.400> for<00:03:00.579> you

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
two scores can work really well for you

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.339 
two scores can work really well for you
in<00:03:00.879> the<00:03:01.180> fact<00:03:01.389> you<00:03:01.450> can<00:03:01.599> basically<00:03:02.139> have

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:02.349 
in the fact you can basically have

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.399 
in the fact you can basically have
practice<00:03:02.829> runs<00:03:03.569> but<00:03:04.569> on<00:03:04.840> the<00:03:04.959> other<00:03:05.049> end<00:03:05.230> is

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
practice runs but on the other end is

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:07.500 
practice runs but on the other end is
something<00:03:05.859> harder<00:03:06.370> so<00:03:06.579> but<00:03:06.939> it's<00:03:07.389> still

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
something harder so but it's still

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.209 
something harder so but it's still
