00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
that the Siberia Elite v2 was if it's

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.630 
that the Siberia Elite v2 was if it's
not<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:40.020> most<00:00:40.200> popular<00:00:40.500> gaming<00:00:41.070> headset<00:00:41.550> in

not the most popular gaming headset in

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.160 
not the most popular gaming headset in
the<00:00:41.700> world<00:00:41.880> it's<00:00:42.090> definitely<00:00:42.540> one<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.990> them

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
the world it's definitely one of them

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.080 
the world it's definitely one of them
for<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.440> couple<00:00:43.590> different<00:00:44.040> reasons<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.940> was

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
for a couple different reasons it was

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.180 
for a couple different reasons it was
one<00:00:45.240> of<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.420> first<00:00:45.600> headsets<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.380> or<00:00:46.800> it<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:46.950> I

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
one of the first headsets to or it is I

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.320 
one of the first headsets to or it is I
guess<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.490> first<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.790> said<00:00:47.970> to<00:00:48.060> do<00:00:48.180> is

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:48.330 
guess the first I said to do is

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.630 
guess the first I said to do is
suspension<00:00:48.900> design<00:00:49.260> here<00:00:49.650> so<00:00:50.280> when<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.490> put

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
suspension design here so when you put

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.280 
suspension design here so when you put
it<00:00:50.730> on<00:00:50.850> your<00:00:51.000> head<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.660> know<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.900> just<00:00:51.930> fits

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
it on your head you know it just fits

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.620 
it on your head you know it just fits
perfectly<00:00:52.740> and<00:00:52.950> light<00:00:53.220> and<00:00:53.490> it<00:00:54.060> works<00:00:54.240> good

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
perfectly and light and it works good

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:57.020 
perfectly and light and it works good
the<00:00:55.170> headset<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.620> not<00:00:55.890> super<00:00:56.280> expensive<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
the headset is not super expensive and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.120 
the headset is not super expensive and
it<00:00:57.090> has<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.240> retractable<00:00:57.570> mic<00:00:58.140> that<00:00:58.590> isn't<00:00:58.950> top

00:00:59.120 --> 00:00:59.130 
it has a retractable mic that isn't top

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.819 
it has a retractable mic that isn't top
quality<00:00:59.610> but<00:00:59.790> it<00:00:59.910> works<00:01:00.240> okay<00:01:00.900> so<00:01:01.110> this<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.710> why

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
quality but it works okay so this is why

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.650 
quality but it works okay so this is why
this<00:01:01.920> headset<00:01:02.370> was<00:01:02.520> super<00:01:02.880> super<00:01:03.030> popular<00:01:03.420> and

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
it was lightweight and it came out with

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.789 
it was lightweight and it came out with
this<00:01:05.970> one<00:01:06.180> which<00:01:06.329> is<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.659> elite<00:01:06.960> obviously<00:01:07.770> a

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
color shift and more alright so I did

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:29.260

the<00:05:28.039> sound<00:05:28.250> test<00:05:28.520> with<00:05:28.729> the<00:05:28.910> three<00:05:29.120> different

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
the sound test with the three different

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.080 
the sound test with the three different
settings<00:05:29.750> the<00:05:29.930> first<00:05:30.169> one<00:05:30.350> was<00:05:30.500> the<00:05:30.620> v2<00:05:31.090> using

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:32.090 
settings the first one was the v2 using

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:34.540 
settings the first one was the v2 using
the<00:05:32.210> normal<00:05:32.360> audio<00:05:32.930> input<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.889> second<00:05:34.370> one

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
the normal audio input the second one

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:40.890 
the normal audio input the second one
was<00:05:35.000> the<00:05:35.720> elite<00:05:37.870> using<00:05:38.870> the<00:05:39.200> same<00:05:39.500> thing<00:05:39.860> as

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:40.900 
was the elite using the same thing as

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.740 
was the elite using the same thing as
the<00:05:41.900> v2<00:05:42.080> has<00:05:42.470> so<00:05:43.120> because<00:05:44.120> of<00:05:44.240> the<00:05:44.300> adapter

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
the v2 has so because of the adapter

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.740 
the v2 has so because of the adapter
here<00:05:44.990> I<00:05:45.580> was<00:05:46.580> using<00:05:46.729> that<00:05:46.910> on<00:05:47.270> the<00:05:47.389> second

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:47.750 
here I was using that on the second

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:50.190 
here I was using that on the second
video<00:05:47.840> with<00:05:48.139> the<00:05:48.229> Siberia<00:05:48.740> elite<00:05:49.099> the<00:05:49.340> normal

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:50.200 
video with the Siberia elite the normal

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.050 
video with the Siberia elite the normal
3.5<00:05:51.200> milimeter<00:05:51.620> plugs<00:05:51.889> and<00:05:52.250> then<00:05:52.400> the<00:05:52.880> last

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
3.5 milimeter plugs and then the last

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.230 
3.5 milimeter plugs and then the last
one<00:05:53.389> is<00:05:53.690> a<00:05:54.500> sound<00:05:54.770> card<00:05:55.010> okay<00:05:55.760> you'll<00:05:55.940> notice

00:05:56.230 --> 00:05:56.240 
one is a sound card okay you'll notice

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.700 
one is a sound card okay you'll notice
there's<00:05:56.419> really<00:05:56.660> not<00:05:56.900> much<00:05:57.110> difference<00:05:57.530> guys

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
there's really not much difference guys

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:00.370 
there's really not much difference guys
now<00:05:58.310> the<00:05:58.849> noise<00:05:59.060> cancelling<00:05:59.690> is<00:05:59.870> a<00:05:59.900> lot<00:06:00.199> better

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
now the noise cancelling is a lot better

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.719 
now the noise cancelling is a lot better
when<00:06:00.530> using<00:06:00.710> the<00:06:00.919> sound<00:06:01.130> card<00:06:01.340> I<00:06:01.550> actually

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:01.729 
when using the sound card I actually

00:06:01.729 --> 00:06:03.760 
when using the sound card I actually
tested<00:06:02.090> that<00:06:02.360> out<00:06:02.419> so<00:06:02.870> background<00:06:03.320> noise<00:06:03.530> is

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
tested that out so background noise is

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.290 
tested that out so background noise is
definitely<00:06:04.130> a<00:06:04.160> lot<00:06:04.250> better<00:06:04.430> for<00:06:04.789> what<00:06:05.000> others

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:05.300 
definitely a lot better for what others

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.600 
definitely a lot better for what others
hear<00:06:05.630> the<00:06:06.139> only<00:06:06.289> problem<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:06.889> I've<00:06:07.070> had<00:06:07.099> is

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
hear the only problem that I've had is

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.730 
hear the only problem that I've had is
that<00:06:07.789> I<00:06:07.820> left<00:06:08.060> the<00:06:08.210> levels<00:06:08.570> exactly<00:06:09.289> the<00:06:09.440> same

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:09.740 
that I left the levels exactly the same

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.310 
that I left the levels exactly the same
for<00:06:10.130> the<00:06:10.220> first<00:06:10.580> set<00:06:11.330> mic<00:06:11.750> test<00:06:11.990> and<00:06:12.169> the

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:12.320 
for the first set mic test and the

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:14.710 
for the first set mic test and the
second<00:06:12.770> and<00:06:13.039> you'll<00:06:13.550> notice<00:06:13.820> that<00:06:13.970> Siberia

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:14.720 
second and you'll notice that Siberia

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.080 
second and you'll notice that Siberia
elite<00:06:15.169> using<00:06:15.770> the<00:06:15.860> same<00:06:16.099> headphone<00:06:16.580> jack<00:06:16.820> same

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
I do not know why this is I don't know

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.320 
I do not know why this is I don't know
what

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
what

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:25.420 
what
SteelSeries<00:06:24.050> can<00:06:24.320> do<00:06:24.440> to<00:06:24.590> fix<00:06:24.770> that<00:06:25.039> but<00:06:25.280> the

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:25.430 
SteelSeries can do to fix that but the

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:27.339 
SteelSeries can do to fix that but the
volume<00:06:25.639> is<00:06:25.970> low<00:06:26.330> so<00:06:26.630> I<00:06:26.660> had<00:06:26.810> to<00:06:26.900> Jack<00:06:27.169> my

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:27.349 
volume is low so I had to Jack my

00:06:27.349 --> 00:06:28.990 
volume is low so I had to Jack my
volumes<00:06:27.800> up<00:06:27.979> with<00:06:28.160> Skype<00:06:28.490> and<00:06:28.699> everything

though<00:06:31.639> difference<00:06:32.330> there's<00:06:32.630> not<00:06:32.870> huge

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:33.199
