you can expand all the way into the

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:42.129 
you can expand all the way into the
street<00:01:39.999> get<00:01:40.999> a<00:01:41.029> little<00:01:41.209> more<00:01:41.389> challenging<00:01:41.959> if

00:01:42.129 --> 00:01:42.139 
street get a little more challenging if

00:01:42.139 --> 00:01:44.889

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
bottles that you can select or that you

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.429 
bottles that you can select or that you
can<00:01:47.869> pick<00:01:48.079> up<00:01:48.609> along<00:01:49.609> the<00:01:49.759> way<00:01:49.909> and<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:50.439> gives

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
you more money so let's jump into one of

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.279 
you more money so let's jump into one of
these<00:01:53.929> other<00:01:54.170> levels<00:01:54.560> here<00:01:54.799> right<00:01:55.490> elsewhere

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
these other levels here right elsewhere

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.370 
these other levels here right elsewhere
we'll<00:01:57.289> go<00:01:57.439> to<00:01:57.969> run<00:01:58.969> downtown<00:01:59.299> as<00:01:59.929> they<00:02:00.109> call<00:02:00.349> it

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
we'll go to run downtown as they call it

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.819 
we'll go to run downtown as they call it
so<00:02:00.740> and<00:02:01.009> you'll<00:02:01.579> see<00:02:01.819> here<00:02:02.240> as<00:02:03.109> we<00:02:03.380> play<00:02:03.560> this

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
so and you'll see here as we play this

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:05.769 
so and you'll see here as we play this
that<00:02:04.340> I<00:02:04.369> mean<00:02:04.789> of<00:02:04.939> course<00:02:04.969> like<00:02:05.419> any<00:02:05.569> other

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
through the levels so really I mean it's

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:41.729 
through the levels so really I mean it's
a<00:02:39.310> very<00:02:39.519> it's<00:02:39.790> very<00:02:40.390> well<00:02:40.930> implemented<00:02:41.379> game

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
a very it's very well implemented game

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:43.170 
a very it's very well implemented game
like<00:02:42.010> said<00:02:42.250> it's<00:02:42.430> it's<00:02:42.730> actually<00:02:43.150> very

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
like said it's it's actually very

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.130 
like said it's it's actually very
in-depth<00:02:43.840> that<00:02:44.079> has<00:02:44.230> quite<00:02:44.560> a<00:02:44.590> bit<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:46.140> it

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
in-depth that has quite a bit of it

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.539 
in-depth that has quite a bit of it
really<00:02:47.709> does<00:02:47.859> have<00:02:48.069> quite<00:02:48.220> a<00:02:48.310> bit<00:02:48.400> of

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
really does have quite a bit of

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.910 
really does have quite a bit of
substance<00:02:49.060> to<00:02:49.269> it<00:02:49.299> I<00:02:49.480> mean<00:02:49.739> we<00:02:50.739> have<00:02:50.890> these

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
substance to it I mean we have these

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.039 
substance to it I mean we have these
three<00:02:51.370> different<00:02:51.489> cities<00:02:52.480> within<00:02:52.720> those

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
three different cities within those

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.509 
three different cities within those
cities<00:02:53.440> that<00:02:53.590> have<00:02:53.709> different<00:02:53.890> neighborhoods

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
cities that have different neighborhoods

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:56.799 
so you know quite a bit of thought

00:02:56.799 --> 00:03:00.390 
so you know quite a bit of thought
process<00:02:57.069> has<00:02:58.409> has<00:02:59.409> gone<00:02:59.530> into<00:02:59.859> this<00:03:00.069> game<00:03:00.370> and

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
process has has gone into this game and
