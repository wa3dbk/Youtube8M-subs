00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:15.300 

now<00:01:03.829> you're<00:01:03.979> going<00:01:04.159> on

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:28.710 

so<00:01:15.790> far<00:01:16.090> pretty<00:01:16.479> basic<00:01:16.720> way

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:28.720 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:38.770 

Oh<00:01:28.750> God

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.990 

so<00:01:39.780> you're<00:01:39.990> doing<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.320> little<00:01:40.350> roll<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.189> slow

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
so you're doing a little roll and slow

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.800 
so you're doing a little roll and slow
down<00:01:42.240> with<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.420> break

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:51.840 

so<00:01:50.409> it's<00:01:50.530> just<00:01:50.710> a<00:01:50.770> lot<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:50.950> timing<00:01:51.460> that's<00:01:51.700> all

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850

00:01:51.850 --> 00:02:27.900 
so it's just a lot of timing that's all
it<00:01:52.000> takes

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:03:05.780 

step<00:02:28.910> six<00:02:29.360> six<00:02:29.780> six<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.950> six

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790
