00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.830
 university la salle morelia three centuries 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.779
 in education we are the community 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.870
 the world's largest educational 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.160
 preparatory degree master's degrees and 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.160
 continuing education 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.980
 professional the governor of the state 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.660
 salvador jara guerrero recognized that the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.880
 confrontation recorded in the frog the 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.070
 last December 16 with a balance of 11 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.260
 dead represents a setback for the 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.730
 security of the entity but I trust 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.410
 that next year will be achieved 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.480
 agreements that allow total disarmament 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.600
 in the hot land region last 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.610
 events if they represent a setback 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.380
 temporary 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.420
 let's see how we close the year I do not 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.320
 I think so 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:50.180
 if we manage to make those responsible 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.630
 how are they making their statements 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:56.000
 me what we could advance so that the 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.680
 incoming year we had a disarmament in 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.600
 press conference the state executive 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.950
 recognized that the agreements for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.750
 disarmament in the region were not 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.030
 enough because for the inhabitants 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.040
 of the region carrying weapons is a culture 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.890
 if it was not enough, it certainly was not 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.070
 enough you still see in the 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.130
 zone the 3 same have witnessed 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.410
 that a lot of people are armed yes 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.600
 I think it has not been enough 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.369
 development must continue working to 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.020
 be questioned about whether he is subject to 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.940
 research an audio that circulates in 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.860
 social networks about an alleged 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.750
 American talk with the attorney 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.399
 of state blade and another of 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.619
 moral hipolito asking for resources to 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.509
 follow your state executive movement 

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:38.840
 I say that no elements are configured 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.210
 in a crime I do not think these audios 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.030
 the videos have some kind of value 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.040
 this legal because I effectively like 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.350
 you say you do not know who you are with 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.380
 talking to the American then neither 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.170
 does not imply any kind of 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.030
 and legality I think that while not 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.320
 we found some indication index of 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.270
 illegality because they would not have why 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.740
 salvador research jara said that the 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.810
 former secretary of public security of 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.549
 carlos hugo castellanos is already 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.590
 working hard in shaping 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.550
 the only police for the state to
