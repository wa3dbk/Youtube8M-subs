00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:02.960
Hi, I’m Jim, for Mercedes-Benz.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.510
I’m going to show you how to operate the
radio in your vehicle, with a touchpad central

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.880
controller.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.570
The radio offers broadcast programming from
up to four different sources, or wavebands:

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.340
High-quality HD Radio from local AM and FM
stations…

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:18.510
Nationwide satellite programming from Sirius-X-M…

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.600
And Internet Radio from “TuneIn,” with
programming from around the world.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.660
To learn how to use your vehicle’s COMAND
or Audio 20 controls, please view the separate

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.830
video covering its easy operation first.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.460
To listen to the radio, first make sure the
system is turned on… then press the RADIO

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.300
button… on the console, or the dash.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.070
Pushing the RADIO button again brings up a
carousel menu where you can scroll through

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:43.800
the menu of wavebands…

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.899
Satellite, AM, and FM radio.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.920
The next menu item is Radio Station Presets…
which includes the stations you’ve saved

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.059
in memory for all the bands… in one list.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.739
The final menu item is “Info on Radio.”

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.859
This takes you directly to the Digital Operator’s
Manual built into the display, for more information

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:05.970
on the radio features.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.460
Whenever you return to the Radio menu, it
will remember the last mode you used…

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.030
AM, FM, Sirius…or your Presets for all wavebands.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.470
You can also change the waveband using the
touchpad or rotary controller… by selecting

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:25.480
Radio from the top menu, then choosing the
band from the carousel menu.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.950
If you have the mbrace Apps Package, you’ll
also see TuneIn Internet Radio among your

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
options.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.700
To tune to an AM or FM station, first select
that waveband.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
The display will show all of the local stations
your car can receive at your present location.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.000
Rotate the knob to scroll through the stations,
stopping at your desired station.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.850
You can also swipe your finger left or right
on the touchpad.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.870
To tune to a channel on Sirius-X-M, first
select Satellite radio.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.200
You’ll see a carousel of stations, with
the current station front and center.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.920
Rotate the knob or swipe to select, just like
AM or FM radio.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.660
You can also jump to a specific category,
like a Music type, or News and Talk.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.810
To do that, slide the controller down to reveal
the lower menu bar.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.129
Select Category… and scroll through the
list.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:24.680
To save the current station in your presets,
press down on the controller or the touchpad…

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.689
and hold it briefly, until you see the station
list appear on-screen.

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:32.430
Press again to store it in that location,
or turn the controller to move it to a different

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.970
location… then press.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.769
The presets menu stores all your AM, FM and
satellite stations… together, in one menu.

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.450
You can store up to 99 stations.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.549
The easiest way to access your presets is
from the touchpad.

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.060
You can press the center quick-access key…
or just slide upward with two fingers.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:55.180
Then slide one finger down to reveal the sub
menu.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:03.590
Scroll to Presets, then, just swipe side-to-side
with one finger to scroll through your stations.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:12.200
You can edit or rearrange the saved stations
via Options in the lower menu for the Radio.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.159
If you have an Apple device like an iPhone
or iPod plugged in, you can “tag” songs

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:22.959
you hear on AM, FM, or satellite radio stations…
and purchase them later from the iTunes store.

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.239
While the song is playing, slide down with
the touchpad or rotary controller to reveal

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.129
the lower menu bar.

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.980
Select Options… and “Tag this track.”

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.159
Then just follow the instructions on the screen.

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:42.569
An added feature of Sirius-X-M is alerts,
which lets you preset up to 30 favorite artists,

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.349
songs or sports teams.

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:48.880
As you drive, the system constantly scans
in the background for your favorites… and

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.749
lets you know if it finds a match via a pop-up
on the screen.

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:57.480
With just a click, you can tune to that station,
or ignore the alert.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:03.219
To set up music alerts… while a song is
playing, slide either controller to reveal

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:05.069
the lower menu bar.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:09.340
Select Options… then “Alert for Artist,
Track &amp; Sports Event.”

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.750
Follow the menus to set a new Music Alert
for either the currently playing song track,

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:18.560
or any song by that artist.

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.860
For sports alerts, follow the menus and choose
a team from the NBA, NHL, NFL or Major League

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.370
Baseball.

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.950
You can edit these at any time, by selecting
Manage Alerts in the same menu.

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:40.320
With your Mercedes-Benz mbrace subscription,
your car can also bring you Internet Radio

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:42.900
stations from all over the world.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:48.360
From the Radio carousel menu, select Internet
Radio, and wait a moment while the app loads.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.470
You can also do this by pressing the Tel button…
then select M-B Apps… and Internet Radio.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.530
You’ll see a menu that lets you search by
a number of criteria, from music type to location

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.170
to language… along with recent stations
you’ve listened to.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.540
Just follow the menus to enjoy thousands of
live streaming stations.

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:10.300
You can also save stations using the lower
menu’s “Favorites” function.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.330
Please see your Operator’s Manual… for
more information.

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:16.980
Remember, there’s also an on-screen Digital
Operator’s Manual in your COMAND system.

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:20.070
Just select “Info on Radio” from the main
Radio carousel.

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.400
If you have further questions, your Mercedes-Benz
dealer will be happy to help.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.250
Thanks for watching.
