ian<00:01:38.250> has<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.520> frizzy<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.240> i<00:01:39.390> think<00:01:39.600> is<00:01:39.720> running

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
ian has a frizzy and i think is running

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.780 
ian has a frizzy and i think is running
low<00:01:40.380> on<00:01:40.409> troop<00:01:40.799> count<00:01:41.070> I<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.400> think<00:01:41.579> he<00:01:41.670> has

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
low on troop count I don't think he has

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
low on troop count I don't think he has
enough<00:01:41.820> basis<00:01:42.420> to<00:01:42.540> support<00:01:42.680> his<00:01:43.680> barracks

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
enough basis to support his barracks

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.429 
enough basis to support his barracks
right<00:01:44.369> now<00:01:44.520> to<00:01:45.299> support<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.810> high<00:01:46.200> enough

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
right now to support a high enough

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
right now to support a high enough
number<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.100> barracks<00:01:47.430> to<00:01:47.610> fight<00:01:47.909> back<00:01:48.149> ultras

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
number of barracks to fight back ultras

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.899 
number of barracks to fight back ultras
but<00:01:48.930> he's<00:01:49.049> doing<00:01:49.320> his<00:01:49.439> best<00:01:49.710> he's<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.250> radiating

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
but he's doing his best he's a radiating

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.460 
but he's doing his best he's a radiating
the<00:01:50.939> ultras<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.630> keeping<00:01:51.869> them<00:01:51.960> back<00:01:52.229> and

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
the ultras and keeping them back and

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.260 
the ultras and keeping them back and
he's<00:01:52.740> going<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.040> be<00:01:53.130> able<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.460> get<00:01:53.909> rid<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.090> this

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
he's going to be able to get rid of this

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.950 
he's going to be able to get rid of this
force<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:55.460> front<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> his<00:01:56.640> base<00:01:56.850> but<00:01:57.630> yeah<00:01:57.810> it's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
force in front of his base but yeah it's

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.300 
force in front of his base but yeah it's
going<00:01:58.079> to<00:01:58.170> be<00:01:58.229> a<00:01:58.259> long<00:01:58.469> time<00:01:58.740> for<00:01:58.979> he's<00:01:59.100> able<00:01:59.189> to

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
going to be a long time for he's able to

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
going to be a long time for he's able to
move<00:01:59.490> out<00:01:59.700> again<00:02:00.000> there's<00:02:00.600> interface<00:02:01.320> being

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
move out again there's interface being

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.050 
move out again there's interface being
spotted<00:02:01.920> by<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.130> marine<00:02:02.520> up<00:02:02.700> there<00:02:02.909> I<00:02:02.939> believe

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
spotted by a marine up there I believe

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.569 
spotted by a marine up there I believe
and<00:02:03.619> for<00:02:04.619> Xena<00:02:04.799> he's<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:05.100> to<00:02:05.189> try<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> move

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and for Xena he's going to try to move

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.639 
and for Xena he's going to try to move
out<00:02:05.759> with<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.030> crack<00:02:06.420> squad<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:07.079> commandos

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
out with this crack squad of commandos

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.669 
out with this crack squad of commandos
but<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.459> could<00:02:08.610> be<00:02:08.759> met<00:02:09.030> by<00:02:09.239> ultra<00:02:09.869> after<00:02:10.200> ultra

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
but it could be met by ultra after ultra

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.800 
but it could be met by ultra after ultra
after<00:02:11.099> Defiler<00:02:11.760> at

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
after Defiler at

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.070 
after Defiler at
zergling<00:02:13.319> so<00:02:13.800> this<00:02:13.950> could<00:02:14.099> definitely<00:02:14.400> be<00:02:14.670> bad

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
zergling so this could definitely be bad

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.780 
zergling so this could definitely be bad
but<00:02:16.080> if<00:02:16.230> he<00:02:16.349> uses<00:02:16.530> those<00:02:16.770> sighs<00:02:17.040> bustles<00:02:17.489> good

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
but if he uses those sighs bustles good

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.790 
but if he uses those sighs bustles good
enough<00:02:18.030> I<00:02:18.150> mean<00:02:18.330> effort<00:02:18.630> hasn't<00:02:19.020> he<00:02:19.500> hasn't

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
enough I mean effort hasn't he hasn't

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.860 
enough I mean effort hasn't he hasn't
killed<00:02:20.010> a<00:02:20.340> lot<00:02:20.760> of<00:02:20.819> science<00:02:21.360> vessels<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.750> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
killed a lot of science vessels in this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.270 
killed a lot of science vessels in this
game<00:02:22.080> he<00:02:22.110> might<00:02:22.470> have<00:02:22.590> not<00:02:22.709> actually<00:02:22.920> killed

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
game he might have not actually killed

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.970 
game he might have not actually killed
one<00:02:23.550> but<00:02:24.540> yes<00:02:25.319> there's<00:02:25.620> still<00:02:25.800> a<00:02:25.830> lot<00:02:25.950> of

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
one but yes there's still a lot of

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.320 
one but yes there's still a lot of
science<00:02:26.310> buses<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.670> could<00:02:26.880> tackle<00:02:27.120> the

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
science buses that could tackle the

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.080 
science buses that could tackle the
ultra<00:02:27.660> troop<00:02:27.900> with<00:02:28.050> the<00:02:28.140> radiate<00:02:28.970> okay<00:02:29.970> it

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
ultra troop with the radiate okay it

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.280 
ultra troop with the radiate okay it
looks<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.269> efforts<00:02:30.599> running<00:02:30.840> up<00:02:30.959> here<00:02:31.200> he's

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
looks like efforts running up here he's

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.660 
looks like efforts running up here he's
getting<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:31.650> spot<00:02:31.950> on<00:02:32.130> the<00:02:32.250> Science<00:02:32.610> Vessel

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
getting the spot on the Science Vessel

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:33.979 
getting the spot on the Science Vessel
is<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.239> to<00:02:33.330> know<00:02:33.420> where<00:02:33.599> to<00:02:33.630> send<00:02:33.870> those

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:33.989 
is going to know where to send those

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.449 
is going to know where to send those
scourge<00:02:34.319> if<00:02:34.440> he<00:02:34.530> hasn't<00:02:34.680> he<00:02:34.830> scourge<00:02:35.130> out<00:02:35.310> in

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
scourge if he hasn't he scourge out in

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:37.040 
scourge if he hasn't he scourge out in
the<00:02:35.519> field<00:02:35.790> although<00:02:36.209> he's<00:02:36.540> been<00:02:36.720> committing

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
the field although he's been committing

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:39.259

a<00:02:37.140> lot<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.380> his<00:02:37.500> gas<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.920> ultras<00:02:38.400> end<00:02:38.640> of<00:02:39.090> file

00:02:39.259 --> 00:02:39.269 
a lot of his gas to ultras end of file

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.940 
a lot of his gas to ultras end of file
later<00:02:39.480> so<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.720> might<00:02:39.959> not<00:02:40.080> even<00:02:40.260> have<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.590> gas

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
later so you might not even have the gas

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.420 
later so you might not even have the gas
to<00:02:41.220> tackle<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.800> science<00:02:43.800> buses<00:02:44.099> coming<00:02:44.280> in

to tackle the science buses coming in

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.940 
to tackle the science buses coming in
right<00:02:44.550> now<00:02:44.690> pushing<00:02:45.690> for<00:02:45.989> seeing<00:02:46.260> back<00:02:46.560> even

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
right now pushing for seeing back even

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.789 
right now pushing for seeing back even
further<00:02:47.220> with<00:02:47.549> ultras<00:02:48.380> drilling<00:02:49.380> through<00:02:49.650> all

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
further with ultras drilling through all

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:51.199 
further with ultras drilling through all
of<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:50.100> Marines<00:02:50.459> there's<00:02:50.880> only<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.120> couple

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
of the Marines there's only a couple

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:54.050 
of the Marines there's only a couple
Marines<00:02:51.989> left<00:02:52.410> so<00:02:53.040> frizzy<00:02:53.310> and<00:02:53.549> i<00:02:53.670> think<00:02:53.910> is

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
Marines left so frizzy and i think is

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.640 
Marines left so frizzy and i think is
losing<00:02:54.540> its<00:02:54.660> grip<00:02:54.720> on<00:02:54.989> this<00:02:55.110> game<00:02:55.290> this<00:02:55.500> is

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
losing its grip on this game this is

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:58.280 
losing its grip on this game this is
constant<00:02:56.190> pressure<00:02:56.400> build<00:02:56.760> from<00:02:57.480> effort<00:02:58.140> is

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
constant pressure build from effort is

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.509 
constant pressure build from effort is
just<00:02:58.470> going<00:02:58.560> to<00:02:58.650> keep<00:02:58.799> pushing<00:02:59.160> this<00:02:59.280> with

00:02:59.509 --> 00:02:59.519 
just going to keep pushing this with

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.089 
just going to keep pushing this with
ultras<00:02:59.849> until<00:03:00.150> he<00:03:00.269> wins<00:03:00.860> brazilian<00:03:01.860> just

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
ultras until he wins brazilian just

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.860 
ultras until he wins brazilian just
can't<00:03:02.790> get<00:03:02.970> out<00:03:03.180> enough<00:03:03.420> troops<00:03:03.690> to<00:03:03.840> fight

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
can't get out enough troops to fight

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.680 
can't get out enough troops to fight
this<00:03:04.140> back<00:03:04.319> i<00:03:04.500> think<00:03:04.769> especially<00:03:05.130> oh<00:03:05.730> there's

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
this back i think especially oh there's

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.630 
this back i think especially oh there's
the<00:03:06.780> radiated<00:03:07.410> ultra<00:03:07.860> just<00:03:08.130> going<00:03:08.400> through

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
the radiated ultra just going through

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.420 
the radiated ultra just going through
getting<00:03:08.910> some<00:03:09.180> nice<00:03:09.360> harassment<00:03:10.310> nothing<00:03:11.310> to

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
getting some nice harassment nothing to

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:14.809 
getting some nice harassment nothing to
see<00:03:11.580> here<00:03:11.610> boys<00:03:12.120> but<00:03:12.900> yes<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.500> no<00:03:13.920> more<00:03:14.160> mining
