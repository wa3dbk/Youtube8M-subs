 that have left until now the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.650
 multiplayer no and this obviously goes 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.350
 to bring the lift up the 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.240
 industry the franchise of jalÃ³n general 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.799
 since put in last delivery back 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.630
 He stayed behind and presented us many hours 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.909
 that in 34 and in general also 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.590
 we the youtubers as such 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.690
 Once we do not get on at all anymore 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.190
 come out we did not like it at all so 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.890
 Well, with this I think that they come 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:25.860
 many but many projects themselves 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.409
 this halo collection is going to come out in 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.690
 November of this year 2014 and jaime five 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.490

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.649

 the five then it comes too 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.000
 but too much content let it very very 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.890
 good and as you see here in the images 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.679
 Well, it's pretty but pretty 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.330
 because they are being remastered all 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:47.610
 not remasterizados will become the 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.830
 gameplay is supposed to be 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.539
 very suffered in a thousand or two things that 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.580
 many of those that were competitive 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.630
 they love it because this mud is like 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.969
 start of everything 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.159
 the competitive world of emery and everything 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.530
 related to him and well then 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.720
 basically we have many projects 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.970
 as youtubers that youtubers basically 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.759
 those of us who were in the transition that 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.649
 it was modern blood metal health h 0-9 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.860
 geison yes to the best that your server 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.750

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.989
 other youtubers that are adding 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.090
 according to the time but right now 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:23.730

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.800
