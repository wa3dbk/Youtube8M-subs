whole bunch of videos and I was like

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.690 
whole bunch of videos and I was like
well<00:00:46.379> I've<00:00:46.500> done<00:00:46.680> zero<00:00:47.039> packing<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.640> I'm

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
well I've done zero packing so I'm

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.430 
well I've done zero packing so I'm
starting<00:00:48.000> now<00:00:48.239> but<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.480> wanted<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.899> share<00:00:49.379> a

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
starting now but I wanted to share a

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.189 
starting now but I wanted to share a
little<00:00:49.559> technique<00:00:50.070> that<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> have<00:00:50.879> adopted<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
little technique that I have adopted I

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.130 
little technique that I have adopted I
guess<00:00:52.440> recently<00:00:53.160> because<00:00:53.460> i<00:00:53.670> am<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> severe

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
guess recently because i am a severe

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.380 
guess recently because i am a severe
over-packer<00:00:55.770> like<00:00:56.250> i<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.550> severe<00:00:57.030> over

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
over-packer like i have severe over

Packers syndrome when i go on trips and

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.700 
Packers syndrome when i go on trips and
i<00:00:59.940> found<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.300> solution<00:01:00.449> for<00:01:00.870> not<00:01:01.050> only<00:01:01.260> packing

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
i found a solution for not only packing

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.349 
i found a solution for not only packing
lighter<00:01:01.920> but<00:01:02.129> packing<00:01:02.550> more<00:01:02.760> efficiently

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
lighter but packing more efficiently

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.270 
lighter but packing more efficiently
this<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.870> my<00:01:03.989> solution<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.589> here<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.979> is<00:01:05.129> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
this is my solution right here it is a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640 
this is my solution right here it is a
garment<00:01:06.240> rack<00:01:06.479> and<00:01:06.750> sorry<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.020> have<00:01:07.229> my<00:01:07.350> light

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
I have no light in this room so I found

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.520 
I have no light in this room so I found

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
because the problem that I have is if I

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:30.289 
because the problem that I have is if I
just<00:01:28.650> start<00:01:28.920> directly<00:01:29.430> packing<00:01:29.939> into<00:01:30.119> a

this garment rack I got this at bed bath
and<00:01:53.040> beyond<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.610> it<00:01:54.180> collapses<00:01:54.899> down<00:01:55.079> its

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
and beyond is it collapses down its

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:56.749 
and beyond is it collapses down its
adjustable<00:01:55.770> so<00:01:55.950> i<00:01:56.009> can<00:01:56.130> adjust<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.579> height

April<00:04:37.440> and<00:04:37.590> I<00:04:37.680> absolutely<00:04:38.310> love<00:04:38.640> it<00:04:38.670> I<00:04:38.970> love

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
April and I absolutely love it I love

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.270 
April and I absolutely love it I love
the<00:04:39.360> color<00:04:39.660> I<00:04:39.840> love<00:04:40.140> the<00:04:40.290> spike<00:04:40.560> detail<00:04:40.980> and<00:04:41.190> it

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
the color I love the spike detail and it

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:43.910 
the color I love the spike detail and it
is<00:04:41.400> a<00:04:41.430> perfect<00:04:42.000> size<00:04:42.240> because<00:04:42.810> it<00:04:43.200> does<00:04:43.500> hold

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
is a perfect size because it does hold

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.500 
is a perfect size because it does hold
more<00:04:44.340> than<00:04:44.400> like<00:04:44.760> your<00:04:44.880> average<00:04:45.060> clutch

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
more than like your average clutch

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.120 
more than like your average clutch
because<00:04:45.750> it's<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.110> little<00:04:46.320> bit<00:04:46.410> thicker<00:04:46.680> as<00:04:47.040> you

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
because it's a little bit thicker as you

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.520 
because it's a little bit thicker as you
can<00:04:47.280> see<00:04:47.550> right<00:04:47.790> like<00:04:48.510> that<00:04:48.720> so<00:04:49.080> this<00:04:49.260> is<00:04:49.380> what
