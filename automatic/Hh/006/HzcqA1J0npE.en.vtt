00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.370 

have<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.870> install<00:00:01.230> an<00:00:01.439> airless<00:00:01.829> bicycle<00:00:02.399> tire

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:03.380 
have to install an airless bicycle tire

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.420 
have to install an airless bicycle tire
first<00:00:04.380> I<00:00:04.589> want<00:00:04.770> to<00:00:04.799> make<00:00:04.950> sure<00:00:05.130> that<00:00:05.310> the

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
first I want to make sure that the

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.179 
first I want to make sure that the
airless<00:00:05.670> tire<00:00:05.940> will<00:00:06.299> fit<00:00:06.509> my<00:00:06.690> rim<00:00:06.960> so<00:00:07.830> I

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
airless tire will fit my rim so I

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.749 
airless tire will fit my rim so I
measure<00:00:08.519> it<00:00:08.760> and<00:00:09.830> I<00:00:10.830> see<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.219> this<00:00:11.370> is<00:00:11.550> about

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
measure it and I see that this is about

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.379 
measure it and I see that this is about
13<00:00:12.300> millimeters<00:00:12.900> wide<00:00:13.820> I'll<00:00:14.820> double-check

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
13 millimeters wide I'll double-check

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.359 
13 millimeters wide I'll double-check
that<00:00:15.900> to<00:00:16.080> make<00:00:16.260> sure<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.740> it<00:00:16.859> falls<00:00:17.100> within

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
that to make sure that it falls within

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.910 
that to make sure that it falls within
the<00:00:17.609> tolerances<00:00:18.300> specified<00:00:19.050> on<00:00:19.289> the<00:00:19.320> website

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
the tolerances specified on the website

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.790 
the tolerances specified on the website
with<00:00:20.250> each<00:00:20.460> tire<00:00:20.960> notice<00:00:21.960> that<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.260> list<00:00:22.560> that

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
with each tire notice that we list that

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
with each tire notice that we list that
this<00:00:22.980> will<00:00:23.189> fit<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.609> rim<00:00:23.820> between<00:00:24.000> 13<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.689> 15

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
this will fit a rim between 13 and 15

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.519 
this will fit a rim between 13 and 15
millimeters<00:00:25.710> wide<00:00:26.330> so<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.630> safe<00:00:27.869> for<00:00:28.320> us<00:00:28.380> to

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
millimeters wide so it's safe for us to

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.359 
millimeters wide so it's safe for us to
put<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:28.949> Daytona<00:00:29.400> onto<00:00:29.910> this<00:00:30.060> rim<00:00:30.980> to<00:00:31.980> install

to<00:01:23.250> do<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.549> this<00:01:23.670> point<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:25.820> lift<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.119> tire

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
to do at this point is to lift the tire

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.550 
to do at this point is to lift the tire
up<00:01:27.780> and<00:01:28.170> over<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.400> rim<00:01:30.710> just<00:01:31.710> one<00:01:32.100> little<00:01:33.000> bit

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
up and over the rim just one little bit

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.950 
up and over the rim just one little bit
at<00:01:34.560> a<00:01:34.619> time

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960 
at a time

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:42.550 
at a time
now<00:01:36.960> all<00:01:37.740> of<00:01:38.100> our<00:01:38.250> cars<00:01:39.229> will<00:01:40.340> stretch<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:41.369> fit

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
now all of our cars will stretch to fit

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.280 
now all of our cars will stretch to fit
with<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.590> Daytona<00:01:44.329> really<00:01:45.329> being<00:01:45.600> one<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.110> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
with the Daytona really being one of the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:50.030 
with the Daytona really being one of the
easiest<00:01:46.740> ones<00:01:47.040> to<00:01:47.399> install<00:01:48.409> all<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.740> tires

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
easiest ones to install all the tires

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.810 
easiest ones to install all the tires
will<00:01:50.700> fit<00:01:51.770> some<00:01:52.770> just<00:01:53.040> take<00:01:53.220> a<00:01:53.250> little<00:01:53.520> longer

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
will fit some just take a little longer

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:00.649 
will fit some just take a little longer
than<00:01:54.180> others

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.209 

now<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:02.070> complete<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.490> process<00:02:02.850> I<00:02:03.680> need<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:05.009> go

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
now to complete the process I need to go

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.059 
now to complete the process I need to go
through<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.539> tyre<00:02:06.840> inch-by-inch

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
through the tyre inch-by-inch

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.160 
through the tyre inch-by-inch
and<00:02:08.569> push<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.750> in<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.250> make<00:02:11.250> sure<00:02:11.280> it's<00:02:11.670> seated

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.170 
and push it in and make sure it's seated

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.759 
and push it in and make sure it's seated
it<00:02:13.170> will<00:02:13.319> actually<00:02:13.530> make<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> popping<00:02:14.340> noise<00:02:14.550> as

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
it will actually make a popping noise as

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.960 
it will actually make a popping noise as
I'm<00:02:16.769> doing<00:02:17.130> it

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.290 

this<00:02:20.970> is<00:02:21.239> locking<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:21.989> tyre<00:02:22.230> into<00:02:23.130> place<00:02:23.340> so

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
this is locking the tyre into place so

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.100 
this is locking the tyre into place so
that<00:02:24.330> it<00:02:24.569> will<00:02:24.720> not<00:02:24.959> come<00:02:25.230> off<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.620> rim<00:02:27.110> once

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
that it will not come off the rim once

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.160 
that it will not come off the rim once
this<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.500> finished<00:02:29.239> this<00:02:30.239> tyre<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.870> give<00:02:31.019> you

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
this is finished this tyre will give you

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.059 
this is finished this tyre will give you
years<00:02:31.440> of<00:02:31.590> service<00:02:32.360> trouble-free<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.739> want

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
years of service trouble-free so I want

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:37.600 
years of service trouble-free so I want
to<00:02:35.130> double-check<00:02:35.430> one<00:02:36.150> more<00:02:36.390> time

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
to double-check one more time

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
to double-check one more time
making<00:02:38.610> sure<00:02:38.640> that<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.630> tyre<00:02:39.840> is<00:02:40.110> indeed

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:40.500 
making sure that the tyre is indeed

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.400 
making sure that the tyre is indeed
seated<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.160> rim<00:02:41.959> once<00:02:42.959> I'm<00:02:43.170> satisfied

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
seated to the rim once I'm satisfied
