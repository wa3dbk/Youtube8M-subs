00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.859 
you got loops here to hold the VNS down
both<00:01:55.350> sides<00:01:55.649> on<00:01:55.890> that<00:01:56.689> and<00:01:57.689> then<00:01:57.780> another

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
both sides on that and then another

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.840 
both sides on that and then another
function<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.829> adjustability<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.670> this

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
function is the adjustability of this

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.499 
function is the adjustability of this
thing<00:02:00.090> you've<00:02:00.719> got<00:02:01.520> built<00:02:02.520> in<00:02:02.700> you've<00:02:03.390> got

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
thing you've got built in you've got

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.149 
thing you've got built in you've got
adjustment<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.140> on<00:02:04.259> the<00:02:04.380> inside<00:02:04.829> here

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
adjustment with on the inside here

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.550 
adjustment with on the inside here
several<00:02:06.000> holes<00:02:06.329> for<00:02:06.659> adjustment<00:02:07.140> around<00:02:07.439> the

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
several holes for adjustment around the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.770 
several holes for adjustment around the
waist<00:02:07.770> and<00:02:08.070> then<00:02:08.759> also<00:02:09.000> like<00:02:09.360> so<00:02:09.479> if<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.630> go

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
waist and then also like so if you go

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.419 
waist and then also like so if you go
down<00:02:09.960> the<00:02:10.110> more

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
down the more

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.699 
down the more
it's<00:02:10.610> called<00:02:10.909> a<00:02:11.090> jacket<00:02:11.750> or<00:02:11.840> in<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.319> sweatshirt

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
it's called a jacket or in a sweatshirt

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:14.860 
it's called a jacket or in a sweatshirt
or<00:02:12.829> whatever<00:02:13.040> you<00:02:13.760> go<00:02:13.879> extra<00:02:14.180> judgement<00:02:14.689> here

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
or whatever you go extra judgement here

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.440 
or whatever you go extra judgement here
as<00:02:15.019> well<00:02:15.200> so<00:02:15.920> there's<00:02:16.159> a<00:02:16.220> huge<00:02:16.849> range<00:02:17.299> of

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
as well so there's a huge range of

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.890 
as well so there's a huge range of
adjustment<00:02:17.870> for<00:02:18.170> this<00:02:18.260> thing<00:02:19.450> that's<00:02:20.450> the<00:02:20.689> so

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
adjustment for this thing that's the so

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.530 
adjustment for this thing that's the so
that's<00:02:21.079> the<00:02:21.230> a<00:02:21.409> eight<00:02:21.879> body<00:02:22.879> rotation<00:02:23.209> comes

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
that's the a eight body rotation comes

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.250 
that's the a eight body rotation comes
with<00:02:23.720> black<00:02:23.959> and<00:02:24.319> red<00:02:24.920> white<00:02:25.959> so<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.049> the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
with black and red white so that's the
