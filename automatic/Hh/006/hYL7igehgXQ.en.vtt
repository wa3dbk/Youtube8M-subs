 mean listen to the dao grapes 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.439
 pits bones and the same valuable 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.550
 what could be grapes is that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.170
 used in all cosmetic 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.469
 funds on the girl we are today 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.570
 prepare a miracle scrub but where are you from 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.760
 such an idea to make this facility at home 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.309
 I have one girlfriend 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.090
 then it was said in France 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:47.969
 I allowed myself to go to the spa complex 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.430
 and do the procedures and say such a sword 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.260
 machine I understand that positive 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.899
 emotions are in principle the first thing but this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.940
 we have a rejuvenating gift abundantly here and us 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:58.980
 makes it look good but still 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.809
 a woman should see you care 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.149
 In principle, this scrub can be used 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.760
 water for all skin types is very important 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.619
 of course here she called me and 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.240
 I told the recipes with my friend so 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.659
 We have been using it now. 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.100
 all his girlfriends his mom's sisters and and 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.020
 everyone is happy everyone is happy that 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.259
 get ready to record while we are going 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.390
 let's do this before let's cook 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.799
 can not wait well so here it is here I am 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.799
 I understand and there are bones 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.900
 it is through which you need to grind 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.329
 be sure and I want to turn your 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.150
 attention that is very important to help 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.670
 as small as possible 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.530
 on a coffee grinder and preferably not 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.290
 mechanical consistency should 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.540
 be almost like flour because more 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.170
 large grinding still can be hurt 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.750
 skin 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.240
 is it important what kind of bones of which 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 grapes are black more useful after all 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.729
 there are more antioxidants so I 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.799
 water preference for black grapes here 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.619
 then we need to do a scrub 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.890
 oatmeal is in principle too 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.630
 famous 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.760
 he will pick up armani where at home 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.600
 conditions, too, ground, too, we 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.819
 grind up and need 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.310
 sour cream is very important not fat because 

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.370
 what are you fat sour cream it is absorbed 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.190
 and scrub we need to rub and rub 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.650
 wash off easily and more oil will do 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.450
 grape let's take about 4 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.480

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.580
