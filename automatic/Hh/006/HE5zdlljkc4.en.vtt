first I'm like okay I'm going to be
dying<00:02:35.710> a<00:02:35.800> lot<00:02:35.950> right<00:02:36.190> I<00:02:36.370> should<00:02:36.970> run<00:02:37.180> support

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
dying a lot right I should run support

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.170 
dying a lot right I should run support
that<00:02:38.140> way<00:02:38.350> even<00:02:38.650> if<00:02:38.830> i<00:02:38.950> die<00:02:39.010> my<00:02:39.430> point<00:02:39.880> streak

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
that way even if i die my point streak

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.960 
that way even if i die my point streak
is<00:02:40.360> still<00:02:40.690> going<00:02:41.230> however<00:02:41.970> killstreaks

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
is still going however killstreaks

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.210 
is still going however killstreaks
everything<00:02:43.600> even<00:02:43.870> specialists<00:02:44.440> are<00:02:44.590> disabled

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:45.220 
everything even specialists are disabled

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.860 
everything even specialists are disabled
that<00:02:45.700> way<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.000> can't<00:02:46.360> just<00:02:46.480> get<00:02:46.630> something

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:46.870 
that way you can't just get something

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.290 
that way you can't just get something
crazy<00:02:47.410> overpowered<00:02:48.160> and<00:02:48.550> basically<00:02:48.940> get<00:02:49.120> that

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
crazy overpowered and basically get that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.970 
crazy overpowered and basically get that
right<00:02:49.450> away<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:49.930> then<00:02:50.050> completely<00:02:50.440> destroy

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
right away and then completely destroy

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.800 
right away and then completely destroy
the<00:02:51.130> other<00:02:51.250> team<00:02:51.460> because<00:02:51.820> your<00:02:52.060> team<00:02:52.270> will

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
the other team because your team will

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.110 
the other team because your team will
then<00:02:52.840> get<00:02:53.320> all<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.860> drops<00:02:54.130> most<00:02:54.610> likely

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
then get all the drops most likely

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.670 
then get all the drops most likely
because<00:02:55.240> you<00:02:55.420> can<00:02:55.540> spawn<00:02:55.840> trap<00:02:56.110> at<00:02:56.260> that<00:02:56.410> point

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:56.680 
because you can spawn trap at that point

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.680 
because you can spawn trap at that point
and<00:02:56.860> it's<00:02:57.340> over<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:58.209> would<00:02:58.330> be<00:02:58.420> kind<00:02:58.600> of

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
and it's over that would be kind of

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.900 
and it's over that would be kind of
balanced<00:02:59.110> as<00:02:59.230> you<00:03:00.100> see<00:03:00.280> in<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.490> gameplay

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:00.910 
balanced as you see in the gameplay

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:02.970 
balanced as you see in the gameplay
right<00:03:01.209> now<00:03:01.390> the<00:03:01.780> enemies<00:03:02.230> earn<00:03:02.530> their<00:03:02.770> care

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
right now the enemies earn their care

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.980 
right now the enemies earn their care
package<00:03:03.459> but<00:03:03.730> then<00:03:03.940> we<00:03:04.120> killed<00:03:04.390> them<00:03:04.600> and<00:03:04.840> then

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
package but then we killed them and then

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:07.260 
package but then we killed them and then
stole<00:03:05.260> it<00:03:05.470> so<00:03:05.650> that's<00:03:05.800> one<00:03:06.130> gameplay<00:03:06.490> mechanic

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
stole it so that's one gameplay mechanic

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.810 
stole it so that's one gameplay mechanic
that<00:03:07.450> happens<00:03:08.080> often<00:03:08.490> one<00:03:09.490> thing<00:03:09.670> you<00:03:09.790> should

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
that happens often one thing you should

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.760 
that happens often one thing you should
notice<00:03:10.090> in<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.390> gameplay<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.080> that<00:03:11.410> the<00:03:11.560> big

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
notice in the gameplay is that the big

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.470 
notice in the gameplay is that the big
airdrop<00:03:12.280> has<00:03:12.490> just<00:03:12.760> come<00:03:12.940> in<00:03:13.090> so<00:03:13.240> we're<00:03:13.360> going

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
airdrop has just come in so we're going

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.449 
airdrop has just come in so we're going
to<00:03:13.540> get<00:03:13.600> a<00:03:13.660> bunch<00:03:13.930> of<00:03:14.050> care<00:03:14.260> packages<00:03:14.470> and<00:03:15.010> it

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
to get a bunch of care packages and it

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:17.400 
to get a bunch of care packages and it
randomly<00:03:15.730> happens<00:03:16.330> throughout<00:03:16.600> the<00:03:16.780> match<00:03:16.959> to

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410

zone getting to the first capture point

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.320 
zone getting to the first capture point
first<00:05:00.319> and<00:05:00.560> starting<00:05:01.220> to<00:05:01.340> earn<00:05:01.520> those<00:05:01.940> care

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
first and starting to earn those care

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.360 
first and starting to earn those care
drops<00:05:02.630> to<00:05:02.930> use<00:05:03.169> against<00:05:03.590> the<00:05:03.680> enemy<00:05:03.949> team<00:05:04.190> is

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
drops to use against the enemy team is

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.089 
drops to use against the enemy team is
like<00:05:04.880> lubrication<00:05:05.570> for<00:05:05.810> your<00:05:06.139> sled<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.919> get

00:05:07.089 --> 00:05:07.099 
like lubrication for your sled to get

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:09.159 
like lubrication for your sled to get
down<00:05:07.250> the<00:05:07.400> hill<00:05:07.580> if<00:05:08.210> you<00:05:08.300> guys<00:05:08.449> get<00:05:08.690> me<00:05:08.810> so

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
down the hill if you guys get me so

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:11.200 
down the hill if you guys get me so
having<00:05:09.650> that<00:05:09.680> momentum<00:05:10.400> throughout<00:05:11.030> the

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:11.210 
having that momentum throughout the

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.629 
having that momentum throughout the
match<00:05:11.449> will<00:05:12.020> help<00:05:12.229> you<00:05:12.410> get<00:05:13.070> the<00:05:13.220> most<00:05:13.340> lube

00:05:13.629 --> 00:05:13.639 
match will help you get the most lube

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:16.029 
match will help you get the most lube
and<00:05:13.940> get<00:05:14.270> down<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.539> hill<00:05:14.570> makes<00:05:15.530> sense<00:05:15.830> to<00:05:16.009> me

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
and get down the hill makes sense to me

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.279 
and get down the hill makes sense to me
so<00:05:16.400> we<00:05:16.580> win<00:05:16.759> the<00:05:16.910> match<00:05:17.090> we<00:05:17.330> got<00:05:17.449> care<00:05:17.720> drops<00:05:18.050> on

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
so we win the match we got care drops on

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:20.080 
so we win the match we got care drops on
care<00:05:18.530> drops<00:05:18.860> and<00:05:19.099> Cookie<00:05:19.400> Monster<00:05:19.789> does<00:05:19.940> not

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
care drops and Cookie Monster does not

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.939 
care drops and Cookie Monster does not
eat<00:05:20.330> Gilbert<00:05:20.750> because<00:05:21.050> we<00:05:21.500> have<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.710> lot<00:05:21.919> of

eat Gilbert because we have a lot of

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:24.580 
eat Gilbert because we have a lot of
loot<00:05:22.190> yeah<00:05:23.180> and<00:05:23.630> getting<00:05:23.960> shot<00:05:24.199> in<00:05:24.229> the<00:05:24.380> foot
