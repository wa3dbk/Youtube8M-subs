00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
should fly with silver jet is that we

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.890 
should fly with silver jet is that we
offer<00:00:08.069> incredible<00:00:08.370> value<00:00:08.849> for<00:00:08.880> money<00:00:09.120> so

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
the market and we launched January 25th

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.109 
the market and we launched January 25th
this<00:00:28.320> year<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:28.859> we're<00:00:29.519> in<00:00:29.609> our<00:00:29.699> third<00:00:29.910> month

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
this year and we're in our third month

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.700 
this year and we're in our third month
of<00:00:30.269> flying<00:00:30.510> and<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.810> planes<00:00:31.050> are<00:00:31.230> mostly<00:00:31.529> full

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
of flying and the planes are mostly full

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.319 
of flying and the planes are mostly full
now<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> demand<00:00:32.460> for<00:00:32.640> our<00:00:32.759> product<00:00:33.149> is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.109 
get if you were flying your own
aeroplane<00:01:31.530> clearly<00:01:32.340> we<00:01:32.460> can't<00:01:32.700> deliver<00:01:32.909> that

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
aeroplane clearly we can't deliver that

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.330 
aeroplane clearly we can't deliver that
in<00:01:33.329> its<00:01:33.540> entirety<00:01:33.930> but<00:01:34.560> we<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.950> do<00:01:35.100> something

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
in its entirety but we can do something

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.819 
in its entirety but we can do something
very<00:01:35.640> close<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.350> silver<00:01:37.350> yep<00:01:37.500> being<00:01:37.680> good

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
very close to it silver yep being good

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.499 
very close to it silver yep being good
for<00:01:37.979> business<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.369> think<00:01:38.430> one<00:01:39.060> of<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.210> reasons

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
for business I think one of the reasons

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
for business I think one of the reasons
we're<00:01:39.659> really<00:01:39.869> good<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.979> because<00:01:41.310> firstly

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
we're really good is because firstly

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.620 
we're really good is because firstly
right<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.060> beginning<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.479> get<00:01:42.570> a

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
right at the beginning you get a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.569 
right at the beginning you get a
cost-effective<00:01:43.259> fare<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:44.070> that's<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.369> first

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
cost-effective fare so that's the first

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.819 
cost-effective fare so that's the first
benefit<00:01:44.939> second<00:01:45.659> benefit<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.680> whole

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
benefit second benefit is the whole

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.010 
benefit second benefit is the whole
journey<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.220> stress-free<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:48.630> if<00:01:48.720> you've<00:01:48.840> got

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
journey is stress-free so if you've got

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
journey is stress-free so if you've got
an<00:01:49.140> important<00:01:49.530> meeting<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:49.920> achieve<00:01:50.250> if

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
an important meeting to achieve if

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.370 
an important meeting to achieve if
you've<00:01:50.610> got<00:01:50.790> some<00:01:51.000> objectives<00:01:51.509> to<00:01:51.689> deliver<00:01:52.020> in

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
you've got some objectives to deliver in

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.929 
you've got some objectives to deliver in
New<00:01:52.649> York<00:01:52.890> or<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.100> other<00:01:53.369> way<00:01:53.520> around<00:01:53.640> if

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
New York or the other way around if

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.090 
New York or the other way around if

you're coming from New York to London I

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.249 
you're coming from New York to London I
think<00:01:56.340> silver<00:01:56.850> jet<00:01:57.060> facilitates<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:58.020> for

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
think silver jet facilitates that for

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.859 
think silver jet facilitates that for
you<00:01:58.439> when<00:01:59.280> silver<00:01:59.880> jet<00:02:00.060> was<00:02:00.180> established<00:02:00.689> we

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you when silver jet was established we

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.510 
you when silver jet was established we
recognized<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.829> aviation<00:02:02.100> industry

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
recognized that the aviation industry

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.929 
recognized that the aviation industry
did<00:02:03.119> have<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> responsibility<00:02:04.020> to

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
did have a responsibility to

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.609 
did have a responsibility to
environmental<00:02:05.939> issues<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:07.049> we<00:02:07.170> took<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.380> long

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
environmental issues and we took a long

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.919 
environmental issues and we took a long
hard<00:02:07.890> look<00:02:08.129> at<00:02:08.399> what<00:02:08.610> we<00:02:08.759> could<00:02:08.940> do<00:02:09.209> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
hard look at what we could do to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.500 
hard look at what we could do to
actually<00:02:10.080> make

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
actually make

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.830

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
path that we've decided to take is that

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.270
