00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
put a ghost on the map for example it'll

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:04.969 
put a ghost on the map for example it'll
like<00:01:03.390> changing<00:01:03.750> your<00:01:03.780> Mongoose<00:01:04.409> that's

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
like changing your Mongoose that's

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.440 
like changing your Mongoose that's
basically<00:01:05.369> what<00:01:05.580> I<00:01:05.610> show<00:01:05.790> you<00:01:05.820> now<00:01:06.210> it's<00:01:06.330> gonna

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
that's basically all so I'm gonna make a

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.249 
that's basically all so I'm gonna make a
bridge<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.460> mongooses<00:01:17.570> monkeys<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:19.229> know

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
bridge with mongooses monkeys you know

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.899 
bridge with mongooses monkeys you know
it<00:01:19.799> doesn't<00:01:20.100> really<00:01:20.250> matter

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
okay so let's go into structure bridges

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.179 
okay so let's go into structure bridges
and<00:01:25.409> platforms<00:01:26.390> everybody<00:01:27.390> we<00:01:27.630> just<00:01:27.659> have<00:01:28.200> an

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
and platforms everybody we just have an

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.830 
and platforms everybody we just have an
extra<00:01:29.460> large<00:01:29.729> bridge<00:01:30.090> I'm<00:01:30.329> gonna<00:01:30.540> do<00:01:30.720> this

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
extra large bridge I'm gonna do this

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.690 
extra large bridge I'm gonna do this
fast<00:01:31.200> okay

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
fast okay

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.399 
fast okay
you're<00:01:33.030> gonna<00:01:33.119> be<00:01:33.299> building<00:01:33.540> this<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:34.049> skip

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
you're gonna be building this and skip

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.690 
you're gonna be building this and skip
through<00:01:34.619> it<00:01:34.650> okay<00:01:36.320> okay<00:01:37.320> I<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:38.189> I<00:01:38.280> just<00:01:38.520> felt

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
now you also want to build go into

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.320 
now you also want to build go into
building<00:02:12.320> blocks<00:02:13.690> no<00:02:14.690> I<00:02:14.720> actually<00:02:15.050> go<00:02:15.470> into

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
building blocks no I actually go into

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.700 
building blocks no I actually go into
the<00:02:17.330> doors<00:02:17.780> and<00:02:18.020> walls<00:02:18.320> and<00:02:18.890> build<00:02:19.850> a<00:02:20.210> wall

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:20.710

go<00:02:41.000> in<00:02:41.270> ahead<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:42.140> add<00:02:42.380> in<00:02:43.870> go<00:02:44.870> under<00:02:45.140> gadgets

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
go in ahead and add in go under gadgets

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.050 
go in ahead and add in go under gadgets
and<00:02:46.010> added<00:02:46.540> man<00:02:47.540> in<00:02:47.780> canyons<00:02:48.260> okay<00:02:48.860> I'm<00:02:49.700> going

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
and added man in canyons okay I'm going

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.910 
and added man in canyons okay I'm going
to<00:02:50.120> only<00:02:50.270> do<00:02:50.480> two<00:02:50.780> because<00:02:51.350> this<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.650> just<00:02:51.800> the

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
to only do two because this is just the

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.390 
to only do two because this is just the
tutorial<00:02:52.959> so<00:02:53.959> I'm<00:02:54.320> gonna<00:02:54.500> do<00:02:54.740> them<00:02:54.980> for<00:02:55.160> heavy

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
tutorial so I'm gonna do them for heavy

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.750 
tutorial so I'm gonna do them for heavy
so<00:02:55.790> this<00:02:56.030> is<00:02:56.180> gonna<00:02:56.300> be<00:02:56.540> something<00:02:56.959> for<00:02:57.320> like

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:57.760 
so this is gonna be something for like

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.400 
so this is gonna be something for like
mongoose<00:02:58.760> monkeys<00:02:59.390> whatever<00:03:01.989> of<00:03:02.989> course<00:03:03.290> at

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
mongoose monkeys whatever of course at

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.380 
mongoose monkeys whatever of course at
the<00:03:03.500> end<00:03:03.530> of<00:03:03.860> this<00:03:03.950> map<00:03:04.160> you<00:03:04.400> probably<00:03:04.910> want<00:03:05.270> to

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
the end of this map you probably want to

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.050 
the end of this map you probably want to
add<00:03:06.020> in<00:03:06.320> like<00:03:06.620> you<00:03:07.310> know<00:03:07.430> um<00:03:07.790> a<00:03:08.560> teleporter<00:03:09.560> and

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
add in like you know um a teleporter and

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.729 
add in like you know um a teleporter and
add<00:03:11.060> it<00:03:11.330> to<00:03:11.360> you<00:03:11.570> know<00:03:11.690> somewhere<00:03:12.050> interesting

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
add it to you know somewhere interesting

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.470 
add it to you know somewhere interesting
so<00:03:12.920> when<00:03:13.040> you<00:03:13.160> win<00:03:13.400> you<00:03:13.910> actually<00:03:14.239> win

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
so when you win you actually win

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:21.430 
so when you win you actually win

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
building block and then put a block

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:34.750 
building block and then put a block
right<00:03:34.160> above<00:03:34.489> it

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760
