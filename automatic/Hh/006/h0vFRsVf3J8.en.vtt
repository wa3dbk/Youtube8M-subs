00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 It was a hot summer and the cicada 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.609
 he sang and had fun on the branch of a 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.680
 tree 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:12.110
 just below him the group of ants 

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.019
 loaded with seeds and grains for their 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.480
 home the city shouted the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:19.279
 ants was because you work so much 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.529
 on a hot day like today 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.529
 come in the shade to play with me 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.780
 but the ants ignored it and 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.000
 they said to each other when 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.739
 come winter the snow will cover the 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.680
 land and it will be very difficult to find 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:39.050
 that's why we should work now and 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.440
 save food for winter what 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.309
 I prefer wheat guarantors to work 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.980
 said the cicada while the citizen 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:52.520
 amused the ants worked without 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:55.610
 stop all summer one morning 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.280
 the cicada woke up and realized 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.800
 that the cold winter had come 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.110
 snow had covered everything and it was 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:07.110
 impossible to find something to eat 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.620
 died of cold began to walk in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:14.330
 looking for food and shelter in the distance saw 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:18.650
 a little house with light and approached her 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.650
 I opened the door please 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:26.680

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:29.950

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:33.750

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:43.659
 he answered the blackboard if I remember you 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.909

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.159

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.009

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:56.619

00:01:53.319 --> 00:02:01.960
 cicada so singing and then it continues 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:04.220
 singing told the ant a lot cold 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:06.920
 to sing 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:09.560

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.880

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.180
 cicada 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.210

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:19.820

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.520
 arrive the summer the cicada learned the 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.870
 lesson and I help the ants to collect 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.870
