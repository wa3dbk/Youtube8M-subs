00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:12.129 
company at t4 2012 and what we've got

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:14.149 
company at t4 2012 and what we've got
right<00:00:12.280> here<00:00:12.309> is<00:00:12.519> the<00:00:12.789> MINIX<00:00:13.119> neo<00:00:13.209> Tab<00:00:13.599> 10.1

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:14.159 
right here is the MINIX neo Tab 10.1

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.730 
right here is the MINIX neo Tab 10.1
advanced<00:00:15.159> and<00:00:15.339> the<00:00:15.610> MINIX<00:00:15.820> neo<00:00:15.940> Tab<00:00:16.359> 10.1<00:00:16.810> the

advanced and the MINIX neo Tab 10.1 the

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.620 
advanced and the MINIX neo Tab 10.1 the
main<00:00:17.920> difference<00:00:18.279> is<00:00:18.460> that<00:00:18.490> this<00:00:19.119> one<00:00:19.179> has<00:00:19.449> got

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:19.630 
main difference is that this one has got

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.019 
main difference is that this one has got
a<00:00:19.660> metal<00:00:20.019> back<00:00:20.170> and<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:21.130> bigger<00:00:21.340> battery<00:00:21.609> and

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:22.029 
a metal back and a bigger battery and

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.349 
a metal back and a bigger battery and
this<00:00:22.359> is<00:00:22.509> only<00:00:22.630> plastics<00:00:24.000> this<00:00:25.000> one<00:00:25.210> is

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:25.359 
this is only plastics this one is

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:27.929 
this is only plastics this one is
actually<00:00:25.480> running<00:00:25.900> Android<00:00:26.580> 4.1<00:00:27.580> jelly<00:00:27.609> bean

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
actually running Android 4.1 jelly bean

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.770 
actually running Android 4.1 jelly bean
already

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:29.780 
already

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:32.170 
already
you<00:00:29.840> can<00:00:30.020> see<00:00:30.200> there<00:00:30.410> and<00:00:31.070> the<00:00:31.970> only

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
you can see there and the only

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.360 
you can see there and the only
difference<00:00:32.510> is<00:00:32.630> as<00:00:32.780> I<00:00:32.930> said<00:00:33.170> the<00:00:33.380> back<00:00:33.560> and<00:00:33.980> the

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
difference is as I said the back and the

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.670 
difference is as I said the back and the
battery<00:00:34.640> on<00:00:34.790> this<00:00:34.910> one<00:00:35.090> is<00:00:35.210> only<00:00:35.360> six<00:00:35.840> sixty

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
battery on this one is only six sixty

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.010 
battery on this one is only six sixty
eight<00:00:36.800> hundred<00:00:37.340> milli<00:00:38.180> ampair<00:00:38.450> hours<00:00:38.690> and

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.020 
eight hundred milli ampair hours and

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.490 
eight hundred milli ampair hours and
this<00:00:39.110> one<00:00:39.290> is<00:00:39.410> at<00:00:39.560> 7200<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:42.170> that's<00:00:42.350> pretty

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:42.500 
this one is at 7200 and that's pretty

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.020 
this one is at 7200 and that's pretty
much<00:00:42.650> it<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:42.950> pricing<00:00:43.340> difference<00:00:43.670> would<00:00:43.820> be

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
much it the pricing difference would be

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.120 
much it the pricing difference would be
this<00:00:44.480> is<00:00:44.660> two<00:00:45.020> hundred<00:00:45.140> and<00:00:45.350> twenty<00:00:45.620> euros<00:00:45.920> or

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:46.130 
this is two hundred and twenty euros or

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.650 
this is two hundred and twenty euros or
about<00:00:46.340> two<00:00:46.670> hundred<00:00:46.970> twenty<00:00:47.180> years<00:00:47.330> and<00:00:47.600> this

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
about two hundred twenty years and this

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.920 
about two hundred twenty years and this
is<00:00:47.720> 210<00:00:48.230> or<00:00:48.470> two<00:00:48.800> hundred<00:00:49.510> the<00:00:50.510> specs<00:00:50.750> are

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
is 210 or two hundred the specs are

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.060 
is 210 or two hundred the specs are
pretty<00:00:51.140> much<00:00:51.290> the<00:00:51.440> same<00:00:51.650> they're<00:00:51.860> both

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
pretty much the same they're both

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:58.690 
pretty much the same they're both
dual-core<00:00:52.660> rockchip<00:00:53.660> rk3288<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:58.340> that's<00:00:58.520> an

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:58.700 
dual-core rockchip rk3288 so that's an

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.670 
dual-core rockchip rk3288 so that's an
ARM<00:00:58.879> Cortex<00:00:59.120> a9<00:00:59.420> the<00:00:59.809> performance<00:01:00.320> pretty

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:00.680 
ARM Cortex a9 the performance pretty

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.950 
ARM Cortex a9 the performance pretty
decent<00:01:01.070> also<00:01:01.489> because<00:01:01.790> it<00:01:01.970> has<00:01:02.089> a<00:01:02.120> Mali<00:01:02.420> 400

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
decent also because it has a Mali 400

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.229 
decent also because it has a Mali 400
graphics<00:01:03.500> chip<00:01:03.710> in<00:01:03.860> there<00:01:04.040> for<00:01:04.580> graphics<00:01:05.000> part

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:05.239 
graphics chip in there for graphics part

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.740 
graphics chip in there for graphics part
on<00:01:05.480> the<00:01:05.630> chip<00:01:06.190> the<00:01:07.190> resolution<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:07.970> 1280<00:01:08.510> by

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
on the chip the resolution is 1280 by

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.050 
on the chip the resolution is 1280 by
800<00:01:08.930> pretty<00:01:09.530> much<00:01:09.710> standard<00:01:10.159> it's<00:01:10.640> an<00:01:10.760> IPS

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
800 pretty much standard it's an IPS

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.420 
800 pretty much standard it's an IPS
panel<00:01:11.510> so<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.230> viewing<00:01:12.530> angles<00:01:12.860> are<00:01:13.070> very

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
panel so the viewing angles are very

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:16.390 
panel so the viewing angles are very
decent<00:01:14.180> actually<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.409> brightness<00:01:15.800> is<00:01:15.950> also

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:16.400 
decent actually the brightness is also

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.970 
decent actually the brightness is also
totally<00:01:16.610> alright<00:01:17.060> and<00:01:17.630> it's<00:01:17.810> got<00:01:17.990> 10.10

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
totally alright and it's got 10.10

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.139 
totally alright and it's got 10.10
