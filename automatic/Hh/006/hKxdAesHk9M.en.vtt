part two of probably quite a few parts

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.860 
part two of probably quite a few parts
to<00:00:14.920> this<00:00:15.520> process<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.090> wanted<00:00:16.330> to<00:00:16.390> show<00:00:16.600> you<00:00:16.660> the

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
equipment that I'll be using outside of

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.689 
equipment that I'll be using outside of
where<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:19.869> spring<00:00:20.200> is<00:00:20.429> meaning<00:00:21.429> I'm<00:00:21.519> going<00:00:21.550> to

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:21.699 
where the spring is meaning I'm going to

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:24.050 
where the spring is meaning I'm going to
show<00:00:21.849> it<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.029> you<00:00:22.150> right<00:00:22.300> here<00:00:22.449> at<00:00:23.080> my<00:00:23.289> shop<00:00:23.560> and

and<00:00:25.060> it's<00:00:25.840> pretty<00:00:26.080> neat<00:00:26.289> and<00:00:26.560> it's

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
and it's pretty neat and it's

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.249 
and it's pretty neat and it's
maintainable<00:00:27.849> which<00:00:28.210> is<00:00:28.390> what<00:00:28.720> I<00:00:28.750> really<00:00:29.109> like

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:29.259 
maintainable which is what I really like

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:31.200 
maintainable which is what I really like
about<00:00:29.289> doing<00:00:29.859> a<00:00:29.949> developing<00:00:30.699> a<00:00:30.759> spring<00:00:31.029> this

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:31.210 
about doing a developing a spring this

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:33.120 
about doing a developing a spring this
way<00:00:31.390> and<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:32.230> I'm<00:00:32.290> going<00:00:32.439> to<00:00:32.500> show<00:00:32.650> you<00:00:32.710> three

way and so I'm going to show you three

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.880 
way and so I'm going to show you three
parts<00:00:33.520> water<00:00:33.910> collecting<00:00:34.570> the<00:00:35.290> actual<00:00:35.620> spring

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
parts water collecting the actual spring

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.060 
parts water collecting the actual spring
box<00:00:36.130> how<00:00:36.789> it's<00:00:36.969> used<00:00:37.210> and<00:00:37.510> then<00:00:37.930> the<00:00:38.620> holding

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:39.070 
box how it's used and then the holding

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.180 
box how it's used and then the holding
tank<00:00:39.340> can<00:00:39.820> be<00:00:39.850> just<00:00:40.300> about<00:00:40.450> anything<00:00:41.190> to

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:42.190 
tank can be just about anything to

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.010 
tank can be just about anything to
collect<00:00:42.520> the<00:00:42.610> water<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:43.059> all<00:00:43.570> right<00:00:43.719> what<00:00:43.930> I'm

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:44.020 
collect the water in all right what I'm

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.540 
collect the water in all right what I'm
going<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.199> show<00:00:44.379> you<00:00:44.410> now<00:00:44.649> is<00:00:44.890> the<00:00:44.920> collection

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:45.550 
going to show you now is the collection

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.099 
going to show you now is the collection
system<00:00:46.410> what<00:00:47.410> we<00:00:47.530> have<00:00:47.680> here<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:49.660> the

00:00:50.099 --> 00:00:50.109 
system what we have here is the

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:51.569 
system what we have here is the
collection<00:00:50.260> system<00:00:50.920> if<00:00:51.100> you<00:00:51.219> remember<00:00:51.460> from

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
collection system if you remember from

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.040 
collection system if you remember from
part<00:00:51.879> one<00:00:52.059> I<00:00:52.090> showed<00:00:52.449> you<00:00:52.570> that<00:00:52.600> I'd<00:00:52.809> have<00:00:53.020> to

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
part one I showed you that I'd have to

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.830 
part one I showed you that I'd have to
build<00:00:53.350> a<00:00:53.469> dam<00:00:53.739> well<00:00:54.520> that's<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.940> it's<00:00:55.660> going<00:00:55.780> to

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:55.840 
build a dam well that's a it's going to

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.750 
build a dam well that's a it's going to
be<00:00:55.960> this<00:00:56.170> flexible<00:00:56.949> barrier<00:00:57.519> wall

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
be this flexible barrier wall

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.569 
be this flexible barrier wall
everything's<00:00:58.149> labeled<00:00:58.390> on<00:00:58.690> here<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:59.460> we<00:01:00.460> have

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:00.579 
everything's labeled on here and we have

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.459 
everything's labeled on here and we have
a<00:01:00.640> back<00:01:00.850> flush<00:01:01.180> and<00:01:01.359> overflow<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.170> actual

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
a back flush and overflow and the actual

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.030 
a back flush and overflow and the actual
water<00:01:02.769> outlet<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:04.510> flexible<00:01:05.260> dam<00:01:05.710> can<00:01:05.890> be

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:06.040 
water outlet this flexible dam can be

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.100 
water outlet this flexible dam can be
cut<00:01:06.310> into<00:01:06.340> the<00:01:06.910> contour<00:01:07.360> of<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.570> land<00:01:07.600> and

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
cut into the contour of the land and

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.100 
cut into the contour of the land and
then<00:01:08.920> this<00:01:09.070> will<00:01:09.250> be<00:01:09.340> covered<00:01:09.750> once<00:01:10.750> this<00:01:10.960> is

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
then this will be covered once this is

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.140 
then this will be covered once this is
filled<00:01:11.380> with<00:01:11.560> gravel<00:01:11.830> covered<00:01:12.490> with<00:01:12.610> plastic

filled with gravel covered with plastic

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.550 
filled with gravel covered with plastic
and<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.720> shouldn't<00:01:14.020> see<00:01:14.200> your<00:01:14.380> collection

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:14.560 
and you shouldn't see your collection

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.590 
and you shouldn't see your collection
system<00:01:15.340> if<00:01:15.520> you<00:01:15.880> do<00:01:16.000> it<00:01:16.119> right<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.420> only<00:01:16.509> thing

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
system if you do it right the only thing

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.480 
system if you do it right the only thing
you're<00:01:16.780> going<00:01:16.869> to<00:01:16.930> see<00:01:17.140> is<00:01:17.710> this<00:01:17.950> backwash

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
you're going to see is this backwash

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.910 
you're going to see is this backwash
tube<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.270> can<00:01:19.509> actually<00:01:19.720> add<00:01:20.110> chlorine

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
tube that you can actually add chlorine

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.300 
tube that you can actually add chlorine
bleach<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:22.560> occasionally<00:01:23.560> just<00:01:23.829> to<00:01:23.979> shock

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
bleach to occasionally just to shock

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.760 
bleach to occasionally just to shock
this<00:01:24.939> area<00:01:25.390> for<00:01:25.630> if<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:26.079> ever<00:01:26.259> had<00:01:26.439> a<00:01:26.470> problem

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
this area for if you ever had a problem

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.550 
this area for if you ever had a problem
usually<00:01:27.369> you<00:01:27.430> never<00:01:27.700> do<00:01:27.970> and<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:29.200> can<00:01:29.320> do<00:01:29.409> that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:29.560 
usually you never do and you can do that

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.090 
usually you never do and you can do that
on<00:01:29.680> this<00:01:29.770> overflow<00:01:30.310> tube<00:01:30.900> okay<00:01:31.900> and<00:01:32.110> so<00:01:32.710> inside

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
on this overflow tube okay and so inside

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.510 
on this overflow tube okay and so inside
here<00:01:33.130> you<00:01:34.030> have<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.380> tubes<00:01:35.770> on<00:01:35.950> the<00:01:36.040> bottom<00:01:36.340> is

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
here you have the tubes on the bottom is

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.429 
here you have the tubes on the bottom is
where<00:01:36.640> the<00:01:36.790> water<00:01:37.000> will<00:01:37.180> be<00:01:37.270> collected<00:01:37.869> again

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
where the water will be collected again

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.609 
where the water will be collected again
you<00:01:38.590> get<00:01:38.710> holes<00:01:38.979> in<00:01:39.220> here<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.090> PVC<00:01:40.689> and<00:01:40.899> so

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
you get holes in here this PVC and so

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:43.020 
you get holes in here this PVC and so
the<00:01:41.710> water<00:01:41.920> is<00:01:42.130> going<00:01:42.159> to<00:01:42.310> be<00:01:42.399> collected<00:01:42.909> in

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
the water is going to be collected in

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.969 
the water is going to be collected in
this<00:01:43.149> area<00:01:43.450> up<00:01:43.540> against<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:43.960> dam<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.470> will<00:01:44.680> go

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:44.979 
this area up against the dam and will go

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.359 
this area up against the dam and will go
into<00:01:45.189> your<00:01:45.490> outlet<00:01:45.850> tube<00:01:46.560> if<00:01:47.560> you<00:01:47.770> have<00:01:47.950> so

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
into your outlet tube if you have so

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.030 
into your outlet tube if you have so
much<00:01:48.520> water<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.060> water<00:01:49.270> will<00:01:49.509> run<00:01:49.719> out<00:01:50.170> of<00:01:50.710> the

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
much water the water will run out of the

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.480 
much water the water will run out of the
overflow<00:01:51.460> tube<00:01:51.969> so<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.770> all<00:01:54.009> one<00:01:54.280> inch

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
overflow tube so this is all one inch

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.749 
overflow tube so this is all one inch
schedule<00:01:55.090> 40<00:01:55.329> PVC<00:01:55.689> and<00:01:56.229> then<00:01:56.920> we<00:01:57.040> go<00:01:57.219> to<00:01:57.490> the

00:01:57.749 --> 00:01:57.759 
schedule 40 PVC and then we go to the

00:01:57.759 --> 00:01:59.999 
schedule 40 PVC and then we go to the
next<00:01:58.030> station<00:01:58.240> so<00:01:58.810> in<00:01:59.110> line<00:01:59.380> here<00:01:59.710> you<00:01:59.740> have

00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:00.009 
next station so in line here you have

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.330 
next station so in line here you have
your<00:02:00.450> collection<00:02:01.680> spring<00:02:02.680> box<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.159> then<00:02:03.310> a

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
your collection spring box and then a

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.709 
your collection spring box and then a
tank<00:02:03.610> and<00:02:03.789> the<00:02:03.880> tank<00:02:03.909> again<00:02:04.329> could<00:02:04.509> be<00:02:04.570> any

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:04.719 
tank and the tank again could be any

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:09.940 
tank and the tank again could be any
size<00:02:05.969> spring<00:02:06.969> box<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:08.500> real<00:02:08.830> neat

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 
size spring box is real neat

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.820 
size spring box is real neat
it<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.729> just<00:02:11.270> a<00:02:11.420> molded<00:02:11.810> Springboks<00:02:12.410> and<00:02:12.650> take

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
it is just a molded Springboks and take

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.089 
it is just a molded Springboks and take
the<00:02:12.920> lid<00:02:13.099> off<00:02:13.130> here<00:02:13.640> it<00:02:14.300> also<00:02:14.569> has<00:02:14.810> an<00:02:15.470> overflow

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:16.099 
the lid off here it also has an overflow

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.180 
the lid off here it also has an overflow
drain<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.970> an<00:02:17.270> outlet<00:02:17.830> obviously<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.950> has<00:02:19.069> an

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
drain and an outlet obviously it has an

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.370 
drain and an outlet obviously it has an
in<00:02:19.400> lamp<00:02:19.640> so<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.390> water<00:02:20.690> will<00:02:20.810> be<00:02:20.930> coming<00:02:21.260> in

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
in lamp so the water will be coming in

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.350 
in lamp so the water will be coming in
here<00:02:21.459> dropping<00:02:22.459> down<00:02:22.730> in<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.090> it's<00:02:23.209> got<00:02:23.300> a

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
here dropping down in and it's got a

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.590 
here dropping down in and it's got a
molded<00:02:23.780> bottom<00:02:24.640> for<00:02:25.640> a<00:02:25.670> place<00:02:25.940> for<00:02:26.120> sediment

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
molded bottom for a place for sediment

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.130 
molded bottom for a place for sediment
to<00:02:26.720> collect<00:02:27.080> back<00:02:27.530> in<00:02:27.709> that<00:02:27.920> center<00:02:28.700> area

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
to collect back in that center area

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.110 
to collect back in that center area
there<00:02:30.140> and<00:02:30.380> then<00:02:30.920> it<00:02:31.100> has<00:02:31.310> where<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.880> water

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
there and then it has where the water

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.930 
there and then it has where the water
these<00:02:32.420> are<00:02:32.680> you<00:02:33.680> see<00:02:33.830> the<00:02:33.860> holes<00:02:34.190> on<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.610> tube

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:34.940 
these are you see the holes on this tube

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.160 
these are you see the holes on this tube
and<00:02:35.239> that's<00:02:35.450> where<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.720> water<00:02:35.900> will<00:02:36.050> actually

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
and that's where the water will actually

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.650 
and that's where the water will actually
be<00:02:36.380> coming<00:02:36.560> out<00:02:36.890> now<00:02:37.790> one<00:02:38.360> of<00:02:38.390> the<00:02:38.510> neat<00:02:38.630> things

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
be coming out now one of the neat things

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.750 
be coming out now one of the neat things
about<00:02:38.959> this<00:02:39.140> you<00:02:39.500> can<00:02:39.620> adjust<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.190> overflow

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
about this you can adjust the overflow

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.910 
about this you can adjust the overflow
you<00:02:40.819> can<00:02:41.030> adjust<00:02:41.360> the<00:02:41.510> flow<00:02:41.690> of<00:02:42.140> how<00:02:42.739> much

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
you can adjust the flow of how much

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.650 
you can adjust the flow of how much
water<00:02:43.190> you'll<00:02:43.400> actually<00:02:43.550> your<00:02:44.120> spring<00:02:44.450> box

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
water you'll actually your spring box

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.770 
water you'll actually your spring box
will<00:02:44.930> get<00:02:45.140> from<00:02:45.830> 380<00:02:46.640> gallons<00:02:47.120> to<00:02:47.300> fifteen

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
will get from 380 gallons to fifteen

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.140 
will get from 380 gallons to fifteen
hundred<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:48.260> twenty<00:02:48.590> gallons<00:02:48.920> a<00:02:49.010> day<00:02:49.040> and<00:02:49.459> you

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
hundred and twenty gallons a day and you

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.440 
hundred and twenty gallons a day and you
do<00:02:50.330> that<00:02:50.600> by<00:02:50.780> adjusting<00:02:50.930> your<00:02:51.640> overflow<00:02:52.640> pipe

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
do that by adjusting your overflow pipe

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.990 
do that by adjusting your overflow pipe
you<00:02:53.810> just<00:02:54.019> basically<00:02:54.410> there's<00:02:55.340> a<00:02:55.400> seven

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
you just basically there's a seven

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.880 
you just basically there's a seven
different<00:02:56.150> arrangements<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.080> couplings<00:02:57.620> and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
different arrangements of couplings and

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.070 
different arrangements of couplings and
elbows<00:02:58.340> and<00:02:58.730> you<00:02:59.299> can<00:02:59.480> get<00:02:59.600> seven<00:02:59.870> different

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
elbows and you can get seven different

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.130 
elbows and you can get seven different
heights<00:03:00.530> in<00:03:01.160> here<00:03:01.940> but<00:03:02.209> most<00:03:02.420> people<00:03:02.810> run<00:03:02.959> it

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:03.140 
heights in here but most people run it

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.380 
heights in here but most people run it
at<00:03:03.350> full<00:03:03.560> blast<00:03:03.860> get<00:03:04.730> as<00:03:04.850> much<00:03:05.030> water<00:03:05.209> as<00:03:05.330> you

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
at full blast get as much water as you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.360 
at full blast get as much water as you
can<00:03:05.600> out<00:03:05.630> of<00:03:05.750> your<00:03:05.840> spring<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.380> take<00:03:07.100> it<00:03:07.250> to

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:07.370 
can out of your spring and take it to

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.160 
can out of your spring and take it to
your<00:03:07.459> tank<00:03:07.850> which<00:03:08.390> usually<00:03:08.810> would<00:03:08.930> have<00:03:08.959> an

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
your tank which usually would have an

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.259 
your tank which usually would have an
overflow<00:03:09.410> as<00:03:09.739> well<00:03:09.950> so<00:03:10.700> that's<00:03:10.910> the

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
overflow as well so that's the

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:16.810 
overflow as well so that's the
Springboks<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.380> again<00:03:12.560> this<00:03:13.190> will<00:03:13.370> be<00:03:15.820> taken

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
Springboks so again this will be taken

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.780 
Springboks so again this will be taken
care<00:03:16.940> of<00:03:17.530> very<00:03:18.530> easy<00:03:18.769> to<00:03:18.980> maintain<00:03:19.160> you<00:03:19.609> come

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
care of very easy to maintain you come

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:21.460 
care of very easy to maintain you come
in<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.060> every<00:03:20.450> six<00:03:20.630> weeks<00:03:20.900> maybe<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.290> come

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
in you every six weeks maybe you come

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.830 
in you every six weeks maybe you come
you<00:03:21.620> take<00:03:21.980> the<00:03:22.100> lid<00:03:22.250> off<00:03:22.280> look<00:03:23.030> inside<00:03:23.480> if

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:23.840 
you take the lid off look inside if

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.840 
you take the lid off look inside if
they're<00:03:24.079> sediment<00:03:24.590> in<00:03:24.680> there<00:03:24.859> you<00:03:25.430> pull<00:03:25.730> the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
they're sediment in there you pull the

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.180 
they're sediment in there you pull the
drain<00:03:26.120> tube<00:03:26.450> let<00:03:26.870> this<00:03:27.019> thing<00:03:27.230> drain<00:03:27.590> out<00:03:27.859> and

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
drain tube let this thing drain out and

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:31.270 
drain tube let this thing drain out and
then<00:03:28.940> kind<00:03:29.269> of<00:03:29.359> flush<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:29.870> well<00:03:30.829> you<00:03:31.160> could

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
then kind of flush it well you could

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.640 
then kind of flush it well you could
stir<00:03:31.640> stir<00:03:32.239> this<00:03:32.420> up<00:03:32.600> get<00:03:32.870> any<00:03:33.019> sediment<00:03:33.380> out

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
stir stir this up get any sediment out

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.099 
stir stir this up get any sediment out
and<00:03:34.430> then<00:03:34.579> put<00:03:34.730> your<00:03:34.850> drain<00:03:35.090> tube<00:03:35.390> overflow

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:36.109 
and then put your drain tube overflow

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:40.780 
and then put your drain tube overflow
back<00:03:36.320> in<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:37.060> put<00:03:38.060> the<00:03:38.180> lid<00:03:38.359> back<00:03:38.570> on<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:40.340> you

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
back in and put the lid back on and you

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.120 
back in and put the lid back on and you
your<00:03:41.480> spring<00:03:41.720> box<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.290> ready<00:03:42.680> to<00:03:42.829> go

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
your spring box is ready to go

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.130 
your spring box is ready to go
you<00:03:43.760> take<00:03:43.970> your<00:03:44.120> water<00:03:44.299> from<00:03:44.540> your<00:03:44.690> spring<00:03:44.900> box

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
you take your water from your spring box

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:50.020 
you take your water from your spring box
into<00:03:45.980> a<00:03:46.670> tank<00:03:47.239> any<00:03:47.720> size<00:03:48.109> tank<00:03:48.440> I<00:03:48.709> like<00:03:49.340> tanks

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
into a tank any size tank I like tanks

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.340 
into a tank any size tank I like tanks
that<00:03:50.420> have<00:03:50.709> 16<00:03:51.709> inch<00:03:52.390> manhole<00:03:53.390> covers<00:03:53.810> on<00:03:53.989> them

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
that have 16 inch manhole covers on them

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.280 
that have 16 inch manhole covers on them
because<00:03:54.560> you<00:03:55.100> can<00:03:55.480> it's<00:03:56.480> so<00:03:56.630> much<00:03:56.780> easier<00:03:56.810> to

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
because you can it's so much easier to

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.349 
because you can it's so much easier to
clean<00:03:57.470> them<00:03:57.799> if<00:03:57.950> you<00:03:58.069> ever<00:03:58.220> want<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.579> can<00:03:59.209> add

00:03:59.349 --> 00:03:59.359 
clean them if you ever want to can add

00:03:59.359 --> 00:04:02.170 
clean them if you ever want to can add
unions<00:03:59.810> to<00:04:00.049> your<00:04:00.170> lines<00:04:00.410> and<00:04:00.970> disconnect<00:04:01.970> and

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:02.180 
unions to your lines and disconnect and

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:04.900 
unions to your lines and disconnect and
pressure<00:04:02.630> wash<00:04:02.900> them<00:04:03.140> out<00:04:03.290> so<00:04:03.790> so<00:04:04.790> you<00:04:04.880> have

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:04.910 
pressure wash them out so so you have

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.410 
pressure wash them out so so you have
good<00:04:05.239> access<00:04:05.420> here<00:04:06.019> you<00:04:06.440> have<00:04:06.590> good<00:04:06.889> access<00:04:07.420> in

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
good access here you have good access in

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.569 
good access here you have good access in
your<00:04:08.480> spring<00:04:08.840> box<00:04:09.049> the<00:04:09.680> collection<00:04:10.220> system

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
your spring box the collection system

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:11.860 
your spring box the collection system
would<00:04:10.730> be<00:04:10.850> completely<00:04:11.329> buried

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
would be completely buried

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.550 
would be completely buried
except<00:04:12.530> for<00:04:12.680> that<00:04:12.799> backwash<00:04:13.250> tube<00:04:13.579> and<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.470> if

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:15.560 
except for that backwash tube and so if

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.770 
except for that backwash tube and so if
this<00:04:15.650> is<00:04:15.859> flowing<00:04:16.340> once<00:04:16.910> it's<00:04:17.060> flowing<00:04:17.510> you

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
this is flowing once it's flowing you

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.039 
this is flowing once it's flowing you
the<00:04:18.620> spring<00:04:18.950> box<00:04:19.130> will<00:04:19.430> not<00:04:19.609> freeze<00:04:20.090> okay

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
the spring box will not freeze okay

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.600 
the spring box will not freeze okay
because<00:04:21.260> that<00:04:21.409> water<00:04:21.739> is

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
because that water is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.820 
because that water is
is<00:04:22.669> constantly<00:04:23.449> moving<00:04:23.689> and<00:04:23.990> I<00:04:24.620> don't<00:04:24.710> know

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
is constantly moving and I don't know

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.290 
is constantly moving and I don't know
about<00:04:24.919> your<00:04:25.189> area<00:04:25.520> but<00:04:25.729> where<00:04:25.879> I'm<00:04:25.969> installing

about your area but where I'm installing

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.240 
about your area but where I'm installing
this<00:04:26.659> is<00:04:26.840> about<00:04:27.080> 58<00:04:27.500> degrees<00:04:27.849> and<00:04:29.800> so<00:04:30.800> anyway

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
this is about 58 degrees and so anyway

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.459 
this is about 58 degrees and so anyway
it's<00:04:31.639> moving<00:04:32.030> water<00:04:32.240> it's<00:04:32.509> well<00:04:32.810> way<00:04:33.229> above

00:04:33.459 --> 00:04:33.469 
it's moving water it's well way above

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:36.279 
it's moving water it's well way above
freezing<00:04:33.710> and<00:04:34.159> then<00:04:35.030> from<00:04:35.389> the<00:04:35.719> tank

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:36.289

00:04:36.289 --> 00:04:39.640 
freezing and then from the tank
we've<00:04:36.469> got<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> large<00:04:36.919> overflow<00:04:37.580> here<00:04:38.030> and<00:04:38.719> this

for<00:06:11.719> refrigerator<00:06:13.330> using<00:06:14.330> spring<00:06:14.659> water<00:06:14.900> I

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:15.139 
for refrigerator using spring water I

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.769 
for refrigerator using spring water I
just<00:06:15.800> like<00:06:15.979> this<00:06:16.310> because<00:06:16.610> it's<00:06:16.939> easy<00:06:17.240> to

00:06:17.769 --> 00:06:17.779 
just like this because it's easy to

00:06:17.779 --> 00:06:20.559 
just like this because it's easy to
capture<00:06:18.409> any<00:06:19.099> sediment<00:06:19.580> that<00:06:20.120> is<00:06:20.180> in<00:06:20.419> your

00:06:20.559 --> 00:06:20.569 
capture any sediment that is in your

00:06:20.569 --> 00:06:22.719 
capture any sediment that is in your
water<00:06:20.810> and<00:06:21.050> so<00:06:21.800> what<00:06:22.099> you're<00:06:22.250> getting<00:06:22.400> after

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
water and so what you're getting after

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:25.200 
water and so what you're getting after
the<00:06:23.000> spring<00:06:23.330> box<00:06:23.539> is<00:06:23.839> pure<00:06:24.289> spring<00:06:24.650> water

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
the spring box is pure spring water

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:29.260 
the spring box is pure spring water
alright<00:06:26.210> I<00:06:26.539> think<00:06:27.409> that's<00:06:27.819> plenty<00:06:28.819> long

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
alright I think that's plenty long

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.459 
alright I think that's plenty long
