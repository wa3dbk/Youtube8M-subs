whether you do a soft tap or a physical
tap<00:02:28.510> on<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.780> I<00:02:29.049> think<00:02:29.470> we're<00:02:29.560> going<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.739> see

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
tap on it I think we're going to see

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.140 
tap on it I think we're going to see
sapphire<00:02:30.310> around<00:02:30.549> there<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.909> will<00:02:31.000> say

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
sapphire around there that will say

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.179 
sapphire around there that will say
improve<00:02:31.450> camera<00:02:31.870> probably<00:02:32.230> shooting<00:02:32.470> 4k<00:02:32.709> I

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:33.189 
improve camera probably shooting 4k I

00:02:33.189 --> 00:02:34.349 
improve camera probably shooting 4k I
think<00:02:33.670> the<00:02:33.730> resolutions<00:02:34.120> are<00:02:34.180> going<00:02:34.299> to

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:34.359 
think the resolutions are going to

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.640 
think the resolutions are going to
change<00:02:34.569> it<00:02:34.689> out<00:02:34.780> I<00:02:35.019> don't<00:02:35.170> think<00:02:35.379> the<00:02:35.439> way<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
change it out I don't think the way the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:36.720 
change it out I don't think the way the
phone<00:02:35.799> books<00:02:36.010> it<00:02:36.129> going<00:02:36.250> to<00:02:36.310> change<00:02:36.489> at<00:02:36.640> all

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
phone books it going to change at all

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.399 
phone books it going to change at all
this<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.540> what<00:02:37.689> I've<00:02:37.810> been<00:02:37.840> saying<00:02:38.200> for<00:02:38.349> the

00:02:38.399 --> 00:02:38.409 
this is what I've been saying for the

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:40.110 
this is what I've been saying for the
past<00:02:38.500> three<00:02:39.159> generations<00:02:39.609> of<00:02:39.670> phones<00:02:39.879> gonna

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
past three generations of phones gonna

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.670 
past three generations of phones gonna
have<00:02:40.269> wireless<00:02:40.420> charging<00:02:40.840> if<00:02:41.409> I<00:02:41.500> stand

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
have wireless charging if I stand

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:42.929 
have wireless charging if I stand
outside<00:02:42.010> every<00:02:42.280> day<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:42.549> I<00:02:42.609> tell<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.819> it's

genius so I'm going to say wireless

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.649 
genius so I'm going to say wireless
charging<00:02:47.950> is<00:02:48.849> going<00:02:49.180> to<00:02:49.269> be<00:02:49.359> in<00:02:49.420> there<00:02:49.569> and

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:49.659 
charging is going to be in there and

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:51.509 
charging is going to be in there and
probably<00:02:49.810> an<00:02:50.049> improved<00:02:50.379> touch<00:02:50.590> ID<00:02:50.799> module<00:02:51.340> as

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:51.519 
probably an improved touch ID module as

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:52.979 
probably an improved touch ID module as
well<00:02:51.579> obviously<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.450> usual<00:02:52.750> stuff<00:02:52.840> you

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
expect I'm see we're going to see a

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.309 
expect I'm see we're going to see a
faster<00:02:54.489> processor<00:02:54.970> and<00:02:55.599> probably<00:02:55.900> more<00:02:56.079> RAM

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
faster processor and probably more RAM
