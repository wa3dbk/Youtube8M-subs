00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
fret on the D string is an a note so

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.570 
fret on the D string is an a note so
that's<00:02:05.290> our<00:02:05.410> D<00:02:05.620> power<00:02:05.800> chord<00:02:08.310> we<00:02:09.310> can<00:02:09.429> also

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
that's our D power chord we can also

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.730 
that's our D power chord we can also
extend<00:02:10.000> this<00:02:10.210> to<00:02:10.390> make<00:02:10.509> a<00:02:10.539> D<00:02:10.810> major<00:02:11.050> Barre

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.650 
extend this to make a D major Barre
chord<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.730> that<00:02:12.880> would<00:02:13.000> just<00:02:13.030> be<00:02:13.240> using<00:02:13.480> this

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
chord so that would just be using this

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.090 
chord so that would just be using this
ring<00:02:13.840> finger<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> hold<00:02:14.380> down<00:02:14.560> the<00:02:14.770> seventh

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
fret of D G and B and that's where this

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.190 
fret of D G and B and that's where this
shape<00:02:20.860> comes<00:02:21.100> from<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.840> it's<00:02:25.959> hard<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:26.200 
shape comes from here but it's hard to

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.470 
shape comes from here but it's hard to
include<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:27.190> hear<00:02:27.400> this<00:02:27.580> note<00:02:28.060> here<00:02:28.360> when

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
include to hear this note here when

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.660 
include to hear this note here when
you're<00:02:28.630> holding<00:02:28.930> down<00:02:29.080> a<00:02:29.350> D<00:02:29.739> bar<00:02:31.739> and<00:02:32.739> now

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
you're holding down a D bar and now

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.930 
you're holding down a D bar and now
we're<00:02:34.120> gonna<00:02:34.239> go<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.690> to<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.950> tenth<00:02:36.280> fret<00:02:36.670> on

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940
