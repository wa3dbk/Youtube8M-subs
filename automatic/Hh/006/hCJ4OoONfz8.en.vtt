sure<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.480> interface<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.350> gameplay

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
sure that the interface and the gameplay

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.950 
sure that the interface and the gameplay
fits<00:00:50.250> that<00:00:50.489> console<00:00:51.000> shooter<00:00:51.360> experience

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960

they decide to monetize again we will
have<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.739> see<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.129> it<00:03:29.549> really<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:29.940> big

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
have to see this it really is a big

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.119 
have to see this it really is a big
point<00:03:30.390> of<00:03:30.510> contention<00:03:30.840> whenever<00:03:31.620> games<00:03:31.890> going

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:32.129 
point of contention whenever games going

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:34.399 
point of contention whenever games going
free-to-play<00:03:32.340> yes<00:03:32.819> it's<00:03:33.720> great<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.110> not<00:03:34.230> have

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:34.409 
free-to-play yes it's great to not have

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.960 
free-to-play yes it's great to not have
to<00:03:34.530> pay<00:03:34.650> extra<00:03:34.830> money<00:03:35.040> every<00:03:35.280> month<00:03:35.549> but<00:03:35.940> at

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:35.970 
to pay extra money every month but at

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.869 
to pay extra money every month but at
the<00:03:36.120> same<00:03:36.299> time<00:03:36.480> when<00:03:36.720> you<00:03:36.810> do<00:03:37.019> you<00:03:37.620> get

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 
the same time when you do you get

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.280 
the same time when you do you get
usually<00:03:38.879> unlimited<00:03:39.390> access<00:03:39.599> typically

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
usually unlimited access typically

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.899 
usually unlimited access typically
that's<00:03:40.470> what<00:03:40.650> you<00:03:40.769> expect<00:03:40.860> with<00:03:41.280> sub<00:03:41.459> M<00:03:41.580> ml's

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
that's what you expect with sub M ml's

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.339 
that's what you expect with sub M ml's
and<00:03:42.150> then<00:03:42.239> we<00:03:42.390> worry<00:03:42.599> about<00:03:42.840> the<00:03:42.959> gating<00:03:43.230> with

00:03:43.339 --> 00:03:43.349 
and then we worry about the gating with

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:45.229 
and then we worry about the gating with
a<00:03:43.379> free-to-play<00:03:43.799> option<00:03:44.129> so<00:03:44.310> how<00:03:44.549> are<00:03:45.060> they

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
a free-to-play option so how are they

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.729 
a free-to-play option so how are they
going<00:03:45.360> to<00:03:45.480> handle<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:45.900> that<00:03:46.349> is<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.620> big

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
going to handle this that is the big

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.589 
going to handle this that is the big
question<00:03:46.769> but<00:03:47.250> again<00:03:47.459> if<00:03:47.670> you<00:03:47.819> asked<00:03:48.209> me<00:03:48.239> my

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
question but again if you asked me my

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.570 
question but again if you asked me my
opinion<00:03:48.629> right<00:03:49.260> now<00:03:49.290> i<00:03:49.799> would<00:03:50.250> say<00:03:50.400> we're

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
opinion right now i would say we're

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.179 
opinion right now i would say we're
seeing<00:03:50.849> free-to-play<00:03:51.330> very<00:03:51.720> very<00:03:52.500> very<00:03:52.799> soon

00:03:53.179 --> 00:03:53.189
