00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:22.140
 save here speaking staff cross game 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.930
 has brought another video like 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.810
 I used every weekend and this time 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.619
 I'll be bringing this tutorial 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:34.170
 minecraft how to make a portal for 10 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.590
 in a pickaxe or molds that 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.070
 interfere with the blocks is very 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:43.500
 simply simple very easy practical 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.320
 good because it works with the 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.760
 same type of problem 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.649
 just to mention you are seeing map and 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.449
 the map of the mode of rimini maps that do not 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.660
 has nothing to do with blocks or anything like that 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.010
 just leave this map and and help and the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.489
 old is that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.699
 Anyway, I'll give some tips here and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.589
 You're going to have to follow them to do it. 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.549
 the portal you do not need than the 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.820
 items in the case the buckets to catch lava 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.210
 and water and blocks 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.090
 only so blocks any block is 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.710
 some sand or gravel because it gives 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.630
 The more work you do, the more you work. 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.860
 building the foundation and blah blah 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.689
 here he falls 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.740
 This gives work that has to do a lot. 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.630
 You're going to have to play a lot more than I do. 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.360
 would have to join with other blows but 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.530
 Let's continue here from sources to 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.930
 able to extract water and lava and 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.770
 a video to the end is to see the construction 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.509
 of portal beauty we 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.210
 another thing an observation here that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.210
 You'll need to be attentive to 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.850
 to function so I can do something if I say 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.270
 You're going to need to let it wash. 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.509
 at this point here, not so if you 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.430
 let lavas run off it will appear 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:02.399
 boulder and boulder we do not want 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.450
 because boulders are not cool if they do not 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.509
 need to leave so take the one that there 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.110
 in portugal because if you leave the 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:17.040
 so running when I put water 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.650
 Give me the pride I say I do not 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.920
 are they 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.090
 Let's continue here with the video. 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:31.170
 you will need to make the foundation 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:34.290
 so as to place the lava 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.630
 very very good practice without 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.330
 no secret is very very simple 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:42.450
 very quickly and easily 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.280
 practically and frantically for 12 months 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.840
 so I'm going to spend a quick video now 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.340
 with music to accompany you 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.470
 Portal content while building 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.050
 as background music 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.270
 I'll give one last greeting here now. 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.770
 At that moment, then, the video is 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.420
 sign up for the Swiss channel if you 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.340
