00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260

just<00:01:58.260> watch<00:01:58.440> a<00:01:58.530> tutorial<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> that's

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
just watch a tutorial on it that's

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.240 
just watch a tutorial on it that's
probably<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.270> easiest<00:02:00.360> way<00:02:00.780> but<00:02:01.410> i<00:02:01.680> just<00:02:02.070> did

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
probably the easiest way but i just did

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.730 
probably the easiest way but i just did
that<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:02.670> then<00:02:02.790> braided<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.900> end<00:02:04.230> strand

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
that and then braided the end strand

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.100 
that and then braided the end strand
down<00:02:04.920> like<00:02:05.190> about<00:02:05.460> half<00:02:05.820> way<00:02:06.090> me<00:02:06.330> and<00:02:06.450> then<00:02:06.840> I

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
down like about half way me and then I

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.760 
down like about half way me and then I
just<00:02:07.230> tied<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.710> off<00:02:07.950> with<00:02:08.220> inelastic
