00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:06.180
 hello youtube people I'm 'follow and 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.850
 Welcome to a new call gameplay 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.849
 of duty modern warfare 3 and we will be 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:14.400
 playing all nothing all or nothing in the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.410
 arcade map and I want you to stay 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.040
 see this super game really has 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.450
 a really epic epic ending and I'm going to 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.860
 speak to you in this video about some of 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.660
 the new developments that have been 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.239
 filtering during these weeks about the 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.489
 new title of the white franchise 2 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:31.230
 and about zombie mode 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:34.769
 apparently the buy page banda 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.010
 articles amazon has leaked maybe by 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:40.199
 accident or maybe it has not leaked a 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.350
 phrase in the purchase of the title of the 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.329
 presale of white 2 that says 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:48.899
 supposedly that the zombie mode is going to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.120
 include a campaign mode like this is gentlemen 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.390
 it seems that this title comes with everything 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.879
 and on top of zombies mode other than bringing 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 the functionality of black ops 1 and the 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.870
 flyer to play zombies freely 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.239
 it would also include a campaign mode 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.370
 related to the characters outside the 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.500
 original story of black ops 2 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:08.670
 that's right let's find out a little more about 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.439
 characters 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 if they remember for example in the map of 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.780
 call of the dead had been left 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.189
 locked in that part of the map that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.580
 we had to do the interior to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.250
 release them and it would really be great 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.560
 It would be an invention in and of itself if I 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.680
 will work in this company what would 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.720
 is to take a separate title of the mode 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.430
 zombies that would be genre units 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.460
 take a completely independent title 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.140
 out of de colo duty itself 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.479
 it deals exclusively with zombie would be a 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.190
 half-court goal and if it's going to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.319
 include a zombie campaign mode 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.830
 exclusive will be very good really 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:49.200
 is the strawberry of the dessert I would say that 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:51.810
 I include myself in this mode not because 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.880
 I would really be 10 and I would give a 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.350
 I turn completely to the perspective of 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.470
 the last call of duty that really 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.299
 have been based on an average have 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.000
 been quite loose the last titles 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.819
 nothing to do with the call of duty 4 he 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 webber world 6 and are putting 

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.750
 piles the boys bring the truth 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.610
 that I see them with many ideas with 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.380
 much desire and much effort in this 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.780
 new title of the saga and we are already 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.660
 almost 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:20.209
 passing half in September and I hope 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.220

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.500
