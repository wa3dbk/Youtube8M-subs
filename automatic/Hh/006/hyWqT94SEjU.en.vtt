strum all the strings like this for

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:11.050 
strum all the strings like this for
example

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.120 

that<00:01:11.840> was<00:01:11.960> just<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.229> few<00:01:12.380> examples<00:01:12.500> of<00:01:13.070> some

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
that was just a few examples of some

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.730 
that was just a few examples of some
different<00:01:13.520> chords<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:14.180> of<00:01:14.450> course<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.590> more

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
different chords and of course the more

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.859 
different chords and of course the more
chords<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.220> know<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.880> more<00:01:17.090> flexibility

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
chords you know the more flexibility

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.179 
chords you know the more flexibility
you're<00:01:18.079> going<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.259> have<00:01:18.439> to<00:01:18.680> be<00:01:18.799> able<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:18.979> play

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
you're going to have to be able to play

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:21.190 
you're going to have to be able to play
a<00:01:19.220> variety<00:01:19.610> of<00:01:19.820> different<00:01:20.060> songs<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.960> think

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
a variety of different songs so I think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.929 
a variety of different songs so I think
it<00:01:21.470> goes<00:01:21.590> without<00:01:21.860> saying<00:01:22.250> that<00:01:22.369> it's<00:01:22.729> better

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:22.939 
it goes without saying that it's better

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:25.090 
it goes without saying that it's better
to<00:01:23.060> learn<00:01:23.299> as<00:01:23.479> many<00:01:23.810> chords<00:01:24.229> as<00:01:24.350> possible<00:01:24.860> and

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
to learn as many chords as possible and

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.830 
to learn as many chords as possible and
and<00:01:25.610> then<00:01:25.789> you<00:01:25.939> really<00:01:26.240> have<00:01:26.360> got<00:01:26.539> the<00:01:26.659> ability

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
and then you really have got the ability

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.350 
and then you really have got the ability
to<00:01:27.080> play<00:01:27.439> more<00:01:27.770> things<00:01:28.100> and<00:01:28.399> especially<00:01:28.970> if

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
to play more things and especially if

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.429

you're<00:01:29.539> the<00:01:29.570> sort<00:01:29.929> of<00:01:29.990> person<00:01:30.320> who<00:01:30.350> enjoys

more<00:02:04.490> and<00:02:04.880> more<00:02:05.060> chords<00:02:05.509> and<00:02:05.689> you<00:02:06.049> know<00:02:06.170> we<00:02:06.920> can

00:02:07.029 --> 00:02:07.039 
more and more chords and you know we can

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:09.130 
more and more chords and you know we can
go<00:02:07.189> from<00:02:07.340> there<00:02:07.549> but<00:02:07.939> let's<00:02:08.179> start<00:02:08.360> simple<00:02:08.660> so

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
go from there but let's start simple so

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.539 
go from there but let's start simple so
I<00:02:09.170> want<00:02:09.530> to<00:02:09.560> begin<00:02:09.830> by<00:02:10.009> showing<00:02:10.220> you<00:02:10.399> the<00:02:10.519> e

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:10.549 
I want to begin by showing you the e

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:12.940 
I want to begin by showing you the e
chord<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.720> if<00:02:12.019> you<00:02:12.200> take<00:02:12.440> your<00:02:12.560> first<00:02:12.799> finger

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
chord so if you take your first finger

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.340 
chord so if you take your first finger
and<00:02:13.519> put<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:13.910> onto<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.360> third<00:02:14.599> string<00:02:14.989> at<00:02:15.290> fret

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 
and put it onto the third string at fret

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.830 
and put it onto the third string at fret
one<00:02:15.829> and<00:02:16.100> then<00:02:16.820> take<00:02:17.000> your<00:02:17.120> middle<00:02:17.329> finger<00:02:17.450> and

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
put it onto the fifth string at fret two

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.140 
put it onto the fifth string at fret two
and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:21.170> take<00:02:21.440> your<00:02:21.680> third<00:02:22.010> finger<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.549> put

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
it on to the fourth string at fret two

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.430 
it on to the fourth string at fret two
now<00:02:25.970> if<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:26.180> look<00:02:26.299> at<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.510> chord<00:02:26.750> box<00:02:26.989> next<00:02:27.380> to

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
now if you look at the chord box next to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.259 
now if you look at the chord box next to
me<00:02:27.590> you'll<00:02:27.769> see<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.100> diagram<00:02:28.670> you<00:02:28.910> know<00:02:29.120> if

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
me you'll see the diagram you know if

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.120 
me you'll see the diagram you know if
you<00:02:29.359> just<00:02:29.390> need<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.840> clarify<00:02:30.079> exactly<00:02:30.980> where

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you just need to clarify exactly where

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.009 
you just need to clarify exactly where
the<00:02:31.220> notes<00:02:31.430> go<00:02:31.700> now<00:02:32.329> what<00:02:32.510> I'm<00:02:32.600> gonna<00:02:32.690> ask<00:02:32.840> you

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
the notes go now what I'm gonna ask you

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.750 
the notes go now what I'm gonna ask you
to<00:02:33.140> do<00:02:33.319> is<00:02:33.500> hold<00:02:33.709> down<00:02:33.890> with<00:02:34.280> plenty<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
to do is hold down with plenty of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.360 
to do is hold down with plenty of
pressure<00:02:34.970> and<00:02:35.450> strum<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.290> strings

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.369 

now<00:02:39.700> ideally<00:02:40.420> all<00:02:40.569> of<00:02:40.780> those<00:02:40.930> notes<00:02:41.170> were

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
now ideally all of those notes were

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.110 
now ideally all of those notes were
saying<00:02:41.620> nice<00:02:41.799> and<00:02:42.069> clear<00:02:42.280> like<00:02:42.519> that<00:02:42.730> but<00:02:43.000> to

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
saying nice and clear like that but to

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.030 
saying nice and clear like that but to
be<00:02:43.150> honest<00:02:43.540> I'd<00:02:43.720> be<00:02:43.900> surprised<00:02:44.379> if<00:02:44.680> you<00:02:44.769> get<00:02:44.890> it

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.460 
be honest I'd be surprised if you get it
signing<00:02:45.250> perfect<00:02:45.819> straight<00:02:46.090> away<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:47.319> would

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
signing perfect straight away it would

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.199 
signing perfect straight away it would
be<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:48.069> would<00:02:48.159> be<00:02:48.250> perfectly<00:02:48.640> normal<00:02:49.060> if<00:02:49.150> it

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
be it would be perfectly normal if it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.520 
be it would be perfectly normal if it
sounded<00:02:49.540> more<00:02:49.599> like<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:51.060> at<00:02:52.060> first<00:02:52.420> now<00:02:53.349> let

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
sounded more like this at first now let

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.830 
sounded more like this at first now let
me<00:02:53.650> explain<00:02:53.909> some<00:02:54.909> common<00:02:55.150> mistakes<00:02:55.659> that

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
me explain some common mistakes that

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:57.720 
me explain some common mistakes that
people<00:02:55.989> make<00:02:56.379> when<00:02:56.560> learning<00:02:56.620> chords<00:02:57.310> what

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
people make when learning chords what

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.039 
people make when learning chords what
you<00:02:57.819> need<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> do<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.390> make<00:02:58.569> sure<00:02:58.810> you're

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
you need to do is make sure you're

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.690 
you need to do is make sure you're
holding<00:02:59.409> down<00:02:59.560> with<00:02:59.739> the<00:02:59.829> tip<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.069> your<00:03:00.250> finger

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
holding down with the tip of your finger

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.699 
holding down with the tip of your finger
with<00:03:00.879> plenty<00:03:01.239> of<00:03:01.269> pressure<00:03:01.569> and<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.019> need<00:03:02.560> to

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
with plenty of pressure and you need to

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.770 
with plenty of pressure and you need to
arch<00:03:02.980> these<00:03:03.370> fingers<00:03:03.849> are<00:03:03.879> and<00:03:04.329> the<00:03:04.420> reason

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
arch these fingers are and the reason

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.899 
arch these fingers are and the reason
for<00:03:04.930> that<00:03:05.110> is<00:03:05.379> because<00:03:05.650> you<00:03:06.010> want<00:03:06.340> plenty<00:03:06.670> of

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
for that is because you want plenty of

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.059 
for that is because you want plenty of
space<00:03:07.209> underneath<00:03:07.690> the<00:03:07.840> fingers<00:03:08.440> what<00:03:08.950> we

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
space underneath the fingers what we

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:10.830 
space underneath the fingers what we
don't<00:03:09.280> want<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.579> happen<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:10.060> for<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.480> back<00:03:10.690> of

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
don't want to happen is for the back of

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.020 
don't want to happen is for the back of
these<00:03:10.930> fingers<00:03:11.379> accidentally<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.370> touch<00:03:12.640> the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
these fingers accidentally to touch the

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.990 
these fingers accidentally to touch the
next<00:03:13.269> string<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:13.690> obstruct<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.680> note<00:03:15.000> so

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
next string and obstruct the note so

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.430 
next string and obstruct the note so
when<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.239> pluck<00:03:16.510> each<00:03:16.690> of<00:03:16.870> the<00:03:16.959> strings<00:03:17.260> with

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:17.440 
when you pluck each of the strings with

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.900 
when you pluck each of the strings with
the<00:03:17.530> plectrum

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:21.910 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:24.300 

it<00:03:22.510> should<00:03:22.840> say<00:03:23.020> nice<00:03:23.290> and<00:03:23.620> clear<00:03:23.890> like<00:03:24.070> that

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
it should say nice and clear like that

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.460 
it should say nice and clear like that
so<00:03:24.970> if<00:03:25.030> any<00:03:25.180> of<00:03:25.300> these<00:03:25.390> notes<00:03:25.630> sound<00:03:25.960> incorrect

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 
so if any of these notes sound incorrect

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.930 
so if any of these notes sound incorrect
is<00:03:26.620> probably<00:03:26.950> because<00:03:27.070> you're<00:03:27.280> accidentally

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
is probably because you're accidentally

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.540 
is probably because you're accidentally
touch<00:03:28.270> him<00:03:28.600> one<00:03:29.500> of<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.770> strings<00:03:30.100> with<00:03:30.430> the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
touch him one of the strings with the

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.580 
touch him one of the strings with the
back<00:03:30.730> of<00:03:30.910> your<00:03:31.030> fingers<00:03:31.420> accidentally<00:03:32.290> okay

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
back of your fingers accidentally okay

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.500 
back of your fingers accidentally okay
so<00:03:33.250> it<00:03:33.400> might<00:03:33.520> take<00:03:33.790> a<00:03:33.820> little<00:03:34.060> bit<00:03:34.210> of<00:03:34.270> work

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
so it might take a little bit of work

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.090 
so it might take a little bit of work
and<00:03:34.750> you'll<00:03:34.900> need<00:03:35.050> to<00:03:35.170> shuffle<00:03:35.440> your<00:03:35.740> fingers

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.310 
and you'll need to shuffle your fingers
around<00:03:36.220> and<00:03:36.520> get<00:03:36.670> used<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> how<00:03:37.720> to<00:03:37.780> hold<00:03:38.110> down

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:38.320 
around and get used to how to hold down

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.960 
around and get used to how to hold down
the<00:03:38.470> cord<00:03:38.740> but<00:03:38.920> eventually<00:03:39.250> you'll<00:03:39.700> get<00:03:39.820> it

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
the cord but eventually you'll get it

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:42.770 
the cord but eventually you'll get it
signing<00:03:40.270> nice<00:03:40.390> and<00:03:40.600> clear

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
signing nice and clear

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.170 
signing nice and clear
so<00:03:43.440> that's<00:03:43.590> something<00:03:43.770> to<00:03:43.920> work<00:03:44.130> towards<00:03:44.790> so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
so that's something to work towards so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.640 
so that's something to work towards so

next chord I want to show you is the AE

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.860 
next chord I want to show you is the AE
chord<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.220> it<00:03:47.310> looks<00:03:47.520> like<00:03:47.760> this<00:03:47.970> so<00:03:48.660> what<00:03:48.780> I'm

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870

finger<00:03:51.030> on<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.330> fourth<00:03:51.810> string<00:03:51.870> of<00:03:52.230> fret<00:03:52.410> 2

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
finger on the fourth string of fret 2

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.470 
finger on the fourth string of fret 2
and<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.580> middle<00:03:53.850> finger<00:03:54.180> on<00:03:54.300> the<00:03:54.330> third

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
and the middle finger on the third

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.890 
and the middle finger on the third
string<00:03:54.690> at<00:03:55.380> fret<00:03:55.440> 2<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.190> then<00:03:56.880> the<00:03:57.420> third

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
string at fret 2 and then the third

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.290 
string at fret 2 and then the third
finger<00:03:58.110> on<00:03:58.350> the<00:03:58.440> second<00:03:58.800> string<00:03:58.860> at<00:03:59.160> fret<00:03:59.190> 2<00:03:59.730> so

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
finger on the second string at fret 2 so

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.810 
finger on the second string at fret 2 so
they're<00:04:00.750> all<00:04:00.959> at<00:04:01.200> fret<00:04:01.440> 2<00:04:01.709> but<00:04:02.130> unfortunately

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
they're all at fret 2 but unfortunately

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.520 
they're all at fret 2 but unfortunately
there's<00:04:03.000> not<00:04:03.150> quite<00:04:03.450> enough<00:04:03.690> room<00:04:03.840> really<00:04:04.350> to

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
there's not quite enough room really to

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.010 
there's not quite enough room really to
fit<00:04:04.800> them<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.070> in<00:04:05.340> ideally<00:04:06.330> we'd<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.840> get

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
fit them all in ideally we'd like to get

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.690 
fit them all in ideally we'd like to get
them<00:04:07.170> right<00:04:07.350> next<00:04:07.650> to<00:04:07.740> the<00:04:07.860> fret<00:04:08.130> but<00:04:08.430> in

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
them right next to the fret but in

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.880 
them right next to the fret but in
reality<00:04:09.000> what<00:04:09.480> happens<00:04:09.900> is<00:04:10.080> we<00:04:10.260> end<00:04:10.290> up<00:04:10.590> using

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
reality what happens is we end up using

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.500 
reality what happens is we end up using
them<00:04:11.160> at<00:04:11.250> an<00:04:11.340> angle<00:04:11.730> like<00:04:11.760> this<00:04:11.940> because

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
them at an angle like this because

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.420 
them at an angle like this because
that's<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.930> only<00:04:13.110> way<00:04:13.260> really<00:04:13.500> to<00:04:13.650> squash

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
that's the only way really to squash

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.460 
that's the only way really to squash
them<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.790> there<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.600> of<00:04:15.840> course<00:04:16.019> everyone's

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
them in there and of course everyone's

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.900 
them in there and of course everyone's
hands<00:04:16.739> are<00:04:16.919> different<00:04:17.070> you<00:04:17.459> know<00:04:17.609> if<00:04:17.790> you've

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
hands are different you know if you've

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.580 
hands are different you know if you've
got<00:04:18.090> skinny<00:04:18.419> little<00:04:18.630> fingers<00:04:18.870> then<00:04:19.290> you'll

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
got skinny little fingers then you'll

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.949 
got skinny little fingers then you'll
probably<00:04:19.739> find<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.130> easier<00:04:20.549> so<00:04:21.209> look<00:04:21.780> at<00:04:21.900> the

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
probably find it easier so look at the

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:23.570 
probably find it easier so look at the
chord<00:04:22.169> chart<00:04:22.470> next<00:04:22.650> to<00:04:22.830> me<00:04:22.950> just<00:04:22.980> to<00:04:23.370> clarify

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:23.580 
chord chart next to me just to clarify

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:24.560 
chord chart next to me just to clarify
what<00:04:24.120> notes

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
what notes

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.900 
what notes
we're<00:04:25.169> holding<00:04:25.290> down<00:04:25.620> now<00:04:26.160> with<00:04:26.310> the<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> chord

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:26.910 
we're holding down now with the a chord

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.360 
we're holding down now with the a chord
we're<00:04:27.180> just<00:04:27.600> going<00:04:27.750> to<00:04:27.780> use<00:04:27.840> five<00:04:28.260> strings<00:04:28.740> and

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
we're just going to use five strings and

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.100 
we're just going to use five strings and
what<00:04:29.580> I<00:04:29.610> mean<00:04:29.820> by<00:04:29.880> that<00:04:30.090> is<00:04:30.480> we're<00:04:30.690> not<00:04:30.870> going

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
what I mean by that is we're not going

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:32.510 
what I mean by that is we're not going
to<00:04:31.140> pluck<00:04:31.320> the<00:04:31.410> sixth<00:04:31.740> string<00:04:31.950> we<00:04:32.130> just<00:04:32.340> kind

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
to pluck the sixth string we just kind

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:33.950 
to pluck the sixth string we just kind
of<00:04:32.550> pluck<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.880> fifth<00:04:33.120> string<00:04:33.390> downwards<00:04:33.870> like

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
of pluck the fifth string downwards like

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.750 
of pluck the fifth string downwards like
this

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:40.990 

okay<00:04:38.600> now<00:04:39.110> of<00:04:39.380> course<00:04:39.620> like<00:04:39.920> I<00:04:40.100> said<00:04:40.340> before<00:04:40.520> it

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
okay now of course like I said before it

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.790 
okay now of course like I said before it
would<00:04:41.120> be<00:04:41.240> unusual<00:04:41.660> if<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.140> got<00:04:42.290> it<00:04:42.410> signing

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
would be unusual if you got it signing

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.940 
would be unusual if you got it signing
perfect<00:04:43.310> straight<00:04:43.610> away<00:04:44.020> you<00:04:45.020> know<00:04:45.170> what

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
usually happens the back of this finger

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.620 
usually happens the back of this finger
on<00:04:48.260> a<00:04:48.740> cord<00:04:49.130> accidentally<00:04:49.880> touches<00:04:50.240> the<00:04:50.390> first

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.630 
on a cord accidentally touches the first

now listen carefully to this because
some<00:05:16.050> people<00:05:16.080> get<00:05:16.470> muddled<00:05:16.830> up<00:05:16.919> with<00:05:16.980> this<00:05:17.220> one

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:17.460 
some people get muddled up with this one

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:19.640 
some people get muddled up with this one
the<00:05:17.910> middle<00:05:18.300> finger<00:05:18.660> goes<00:05:18.840> on<00:05:19.050> to<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.320> first

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
the middle finger goes on to the first

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.400 
the middle finger goes on to the first
string<00:05:19.950> of<00:05:20.190> fret<00:05:20.610> 2<00:05:20.850> and<00:05:21.240> then<00:05:21.930> this<00:05:22.139> third

string of fret 2 and then this third

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.530 
string of fret 2 and then this third
finger<00:05:22.860> goes<00:05:22.889> on<00:05:23.190> to<00:05:23.400> the<00:05:23.550> second<00:05:23.970> string<00:05:24.270> at

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
finger goes on to the second string at

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.060 
finger goes on to the second string at
fret<00:05:24.600> 3<00:05:25.110> okay

fret 3 okay
now<00:05:26.370> the<00:05:26.430> same<00:05:26.730> thing<00:05:26.760> applies<00:05:27.330> you<00:05:27.600> know<00:05:27.720> arch

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:27.960 
now the same thing applies you know arch

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.650 
now the same thing applies you know arch
these<00:05:28.260> fingers<00:05:28.650> up<00:05:29.090> hold<00:05:30.090> down<00:05:30.270> with<00:05:30.419> plenty

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:30.660 
these fingers up hold down with plenty

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:32.600 
these fingers up hold down with plenty
of<00:05:30.690> pressure<00:05:30.930> and<00:05:31.350> with<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.889> d<00:05:32.100> chord<00:05:32.370> we're

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
of pressure and with the d chord we're

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.310 
of pressure and with the d chord we're
just<00:05:32.790> going<00:05:32.940> to<00:05:32.970> strum<00:05:33.240> four<00:05:33.540> strings<00:05:33.960> and

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
just going to strum four strings and

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.720 
just going to strum four strings and
what<00:05:34.440> I<00:05:34.470> mean<00:05:34.710> is<00:05:34.889> we're<00:05:35.040> not<00:05:35.220> going<00:05:35.490> to<00:05:35.580> pluck

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:35.730 
what I mean is we're not going to pluck

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:42.650 
what I mean is we're not going to pluck
these<00:05:35.910> two<00:05:36.450> top<00:05:36.810> strings<00:05:37.140> so<00:05:37.470> 4<00:05:38.130> 3<00:05:38.460> 2<00:05:38.700> 1<00:05:40.970> ok<00:05:41.970> so

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
these two top strings so 4 3 2 1 ok so

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:45.770 
these two top strings so 4 3 2 1 ok so
what<00:05:43.050> I'd<00:05:43.110> like<00:05:43.230> you<00:05:43.290> to<00:05:43.410> do<00:05:43.680> now<00:05:43.919> is<00:05:44.250> to<00:05:44.780> stop

so you can look at them next to you so

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.890 
so you can look at them next to you so
you<00:06:05.700> don't<00:06:05.790> have<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.120> keep<00:06:06.270> rewinding<00:06:06.570> the

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
you don't have to keep rewinding the

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.870 
you don't have to keep rewinding the
video<00:06:07.169> and<00:06:07.530> practice<00:06:07.950> them<00:06:08.340> and<00:06:08.370> practice

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:08.880 
video and practice them and practice

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.070 
video and practice them and practice
them<00:06:09.030> and<00:06:09.090> get<00:06:09.270> them<00:06:09.390> sounding<00:06:09.690> nice<00:06:09.840> and

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
them and get them sounding nice and

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.980 
them and get them sounding nice and
clear

00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:12.990 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:15.030 

now<00:06:13.990> there's<00:06:14.230> something<00:06:14.410> else<00:06:14.590> I<00:06:14.800> want<00:06:14.980> to

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:15.040 
now there's something else I want to

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.130 
now there's something else I want to
tell<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.430> you<00:06:15.640> may<00:06:15.850> have<00:06:16.000> noticed<00:06:16.540> my<00:06:16.600> thumb

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:17.140 
tell you you may have noticed my thumb

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.320 
tell you you may have noticed my thumb
sort<00:06:17.890> of<00:06:17.980> kind<00:06:18.250> of<00:06:18.310> hanging<00:06:18.610> around<00:06:18.700> here<00:06:19.180> over

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
sort of kind of hanging around here over

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.610 
sort of kind of hanging around here over
the<00:06:19.480> top<00:06:19.660> of<00:06:19.810> the<00:06:19.870> guitar<00:06:20.170> and<00:06:20.350> there<00:06:20.470> is<00:06:20.590> a

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:20.620 
the top of the guitar and there is a

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:22.770 
the top of the guitar and there is a
reason<00:06:21.100> for<00:06:21.280> this<00:06:21.400> when<00:06:22.270> we're<00:06:22.420> strumming<00:06:22.720> the

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:22.780 
reason for this when we're strumming the

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.620 
reason for this when we're strumming the
a<00:06:22.810> chord<00:06:23.350> for<00:06:24.280> example<00:06:24.310> we<00:06:24.940> don't<00:06:25.120> want<00:06:25.450> the

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:25.630 
a chord for example we don't want the

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:27.360 
a chord for example we don't want the
sixth<00:06:25.990> string<00:06:26.230> to<00:06:26.470> accidentally<00:06:27.160> make<00:06:27.340> a

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
sixth string to accidentally make a

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.580 
sixth string to accidentally make a
noise<00:06:27.610> so<00:06:28.300> what<00:06:28.450> I'm<00:06:28.540> doing<00:06:28.570> is<00:06:28.990> gently

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
noise so what I'm doing is gently

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.890 
noise so what I'm doing is gently
touching<00:06:30.070> it<00:06:30.190> just<00:06:30.310> a<00:06:30.580> little<00:06:30.880> bit<00:06:31.090> with<00:06:31.690> the

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
touching it just a little bit with the

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.440 
touching it just a little bit with the
thumb<00:06:32.170> and<00:06:32.710> that's<00:06:32.950> enough<00:06:33.580> just<00:06:33.820> to<00:06:34.000> mute<00:06:34.240> the

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:34.450 
thumb and that's enough just to mute the

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.380 
thumb and that's enough just to mute the
note<00:06:34.630> so<00:06:34.990> it<00:06:35.220> it<00:06:36.220> stops<00:06:36.610> the<00:06:36.790> sixth<00:06:37.090> ring<00:06:37.240> from

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
note so it it stops the sixth ring from

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.300 
note so it it stops the sixth ring from
accidentally<00:06:37.930> making<00:06:38.260> a<00:06:38.350> noise<00:06:38.470> and<00:06:38.890> then

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:39.310 
accidentally making a noise and then

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.320 
accidentally making a noise and then
when<00:06:39.520> you<00:06:39.610> strum<00:06:39.940> all<00:06:40.120> the<00:06:40.300> five<00:06:40.480> strings

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
when you strum all the five strings

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.089 
when you strum all the five strings
then<00:06:42.930> you<00:06:43.050> know<00:06:43.229> you're<00:06:43.439> only<00:06:43.560> just<00:06:43.860> getting

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:44.099 
then you know you're only just getting

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:45.890 
then you know you're only just getting
the<00:06:44.250> correct<00:06:44.520> notes<00:06:44.819> that<00:06:45.060> you<00:06:45.150> want<00:06:45.180> so

00:06:45.890 --> 00:06:45.900 
the correct notes that you want so

00:06:45.900 --> 00:06:47.869 
the correct notes that you want so
that's<00:06:46.080> the<00:06:46.199> reason<00:06:46.560> for<00:06:46.710> that<00:06:46.770> so<00:06:47.580> what<00:06:47.759> you

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:47.879 
that's the reason for that so what you

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.700 
that's the reason for that so what you
can<00:06:48.060> do<00:06:48.300> once<00:06:48.629> you've<00:06:48.810> learned<00:06:49.020> these<00:06:49.229> chords

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:49.710 
can do once you've learned these chords

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.100 
can do once you've learned these chords
is<00:06:50.009> put<00:06:50.789> them<00:06:50.909> into<00:06:51.030> a<00:06:51.150> bit<00:06:51.300> of<00:06:51.330> a<00:06:51.479> sequence<00:06:51.900> for

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:56.600 
is put them into a bit of a sequence for
example<00:06:52.620> you<00:06:52.740> could<00:06:52.979> play<00:06:53.189> the<00:06:53.370> a<00:06:53.400> chord

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:56.610 

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.610 

four<00:06:57.180> times<00:06:57.539> and<00:06:57.870> then<00:06:57.960> you<00:06:58.050> could<00:06:58.169> play<00:06:58.289> the<00:06:58.439> D

00:06:58.610 --> 00:06:58.620 
four times and then you could play the D

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:01.240 
four times and then you could play the D
chord

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:01.250 

00:07:01.250 --> 00:07:04.440 

back<00:07:01.760> to<00:07:01.940> the<00:07:02.030> a

00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:04.450 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:07.670 

and<00:07:04.960> then<00:07:05.110> the<00:07:05.230> e-court

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680 
and then the e-court

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:18.970 
and then the e-court
and<00:07:08.040> then<00:07:08.160> you<00:07:08.250> can<00:07:08.400> do<00:07:08.490> that<00:07:08.639> again

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:18.980 

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:21.520 

so<00:07:19.820> you<00:07:19.880> can<00:07:20.060> begin<00:07:20.210> practicing<00:07:20.990> changing

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:21.530 
so you can begin practicing changing
