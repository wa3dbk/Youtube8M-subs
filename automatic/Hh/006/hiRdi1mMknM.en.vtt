animal's face is incredible
we<00:01:06.119> should<00:01:06.330> breed<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.780> with<00:01:06.810> my<00:01:07.229> hypo<00:01:07.680> to

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
we should breed it with my hypo to

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.580 
we should breed it with my hypo to
create<00:01:08.490> what<00:01:08.970> they<00:01:09.090> would<00:01:09.240> call<00:01:09.450> heads<00:01:09.840> the

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
create what they would call heads the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.050 
create what they would call heads the
first<00:01:10.860> generation<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.370> be<00:01:11.400> heads<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.940> then

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
first generation will be heads and then

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.000 
first generation will be heads and then
after<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:12.750> long<00:01:12.990> time<00:01:13.290> when<00:01:13.650> you're<00:01:13.770> talking

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
after a long time when you're talking

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.680 
after a long time when you're talking
about<00:01:14.070> tortoises<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.730> breed<00:01:14.970> them<00:01:15.000> back<00:01:15.420> and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:15.690 
about tortoises you breed them back and

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:17.510 
about tortoises you breed them back and
you'll<00:01:16.230> get<00:01:16.470> probably<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.130> most<00:01:17.280> bizarre

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
you'll get probably the most bizarre

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.660 
you'll get probably the most bizarre
looking<00:01:18.120> colored<00:01:18.720> cherry<00:01:19.530> cherry<00:01:20.220> head<00:01:20.430> red

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
looking colored cherry cherry head red

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.970 
looking colored cherry cherry head red
fur<00:01:20.850> tortoise<00:01:21.240> combination<00:01:22.080> now<00:01:22.230> just<00:01:22.860> to

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
fur tortoise combination now just to

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.710 
fur tortoise combination now just to
clarify<00:01:23.190> something<00:01:23.700> here

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
clarify something here

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.750 
clarify something here
cherry<00:01:25.230> heads<00:01:25.500> are<00:01:25.680> a<00:01:25.710> race<00:01:26.100> of<00:01:26.370> red<00:01:26.550> foot

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:26.760 
cherry heads are a race of red foot

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.700 
cherry heads are a race of red foot
tortoise<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.390> they<00:01:27.960> are<00:01:28.110> not<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.260> separate

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
tortoise so they are not a separate

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.740 
tortoise so they are not a separate
species<00:01:29.010> they're<00:01:29.910> just<00:01:30.180> what<00:01:30.360> you<00:01:30.480> would<00:01:30.600> call

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
species they're just what you would call

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.750 
species they're just what you would call
the<00:01:30.810> subspecies<00:01:31.440> that<00:01:31.830> keeps<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.280> red<00:01:32.460> head

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
the subspecies that keeps the red head

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.010 
the subspecies that keeps the red head
so<00:01:33.360> we<00:01:33.540> just<00:01:33.690> thought<00:01:33.810> it<00:01:33.900> would<00:01:33.960> be

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
so we just thought it would be

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.050 
so we just thought it would be
interesting<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.800> what<00:01:35.130> kind<00:01:35.430> of<00:01:35.550> babies

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
interesting to see what kind of babies

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.330 
interesting to see what kind of babies
these<00:01:36.600> animals<00:01:37.140> throw<00:01:37.409> off<00:01:37.650> since<00:01:37.980> they<00:01:38.100> are

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
these animals throw off since they are

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.130 
these animals throw off since they are
essentially<00:01:39.150> the<00:01:39.240> same<00:01:39.390> species<00:01:39.900> just

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
essentially the same species just

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.250 
essentially the same species just
different<00:01:40.500> colors<00:01:40.830> variations<00:01:42.260> basically

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
different colors variations basically

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.010 
different colors variations basically
we're<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.060> having<00:01:45.060> some<00:01:45.300> fun<00:01:45.540> to<00:01:45.900> be

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
we're just having some fun to be

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.620 
we're just having some fun to be
perfectly<00:01:46.440> honest<00:01:46.920> but<00:01:47.730> not<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.030> much<00:01:48.180> fun<00:01:48.479> as

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
perfectly honest but not as much fun as

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.990 
perfectly honest but not as much fun as
that<00:01:48.780> hypo<00:01:49.200> hypo<00:01:49.500> is<00:01:50.250> having<00:01:50.610> right<00:01:50.790> now<00:01:50.970> I

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
that hypo hypo is having right now I

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.740 
that hypo hypo is having right now I
think<00:01:51.240> so

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
think so

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.710 
think so
why<00:01:52.470> don't<00:01:52.740> we<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.520> sneak<00:01:53.850> away<00:01:54.060> let<00:01:54.690> them

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
why don't we just sneak away let them

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.780 
why don't we just sneak away let them
finish<00:01:55.050> and<00:01:55.380> in<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.620> few<00:01:55.920> months<00:01:56.280> we'll

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
finish and in a few months we'll

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.200 
finish and in a few months we'll
probably<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.300> some<00:01:57.540> nice<00:01:57.840> het<00:01:58.770> hypo<00:01:59.430> cherry

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
probably have some nice het hypo cherry

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.740 
probably have some nice het hypo cherry
