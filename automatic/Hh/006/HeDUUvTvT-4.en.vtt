doesn't think like normal people that he

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.910 
doesn't think like normal people that he
has<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> different<00:00:24.060> point<00:00:24.180> of<00:00:24.510> view<00:00:27.769> but<00:00:28.769> the

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
has a different point of view but the

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.740 
has a different point of view but the
reason<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.250> respect<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.760> jager<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.300> much<00:00:30.539> as

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
reason I respect the jager so much as

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.770 
reason I respect the jager so much as
they're<00:00:30.929> very<00:00:31.109> much<00:00:31.289> like<00:00:31.560> my<00:00:31.800> poor<00:00:32.550> dad<00:00:32.780> from

the<00:00:33.899> point<00:00:34.079> of<00:00:34.230> view<00:00:34.290> they're<00:00:34.559> dedicated<00:00:35.160> to

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
the point of view they're dedicated to

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.760 
the point of view they're dedicated to
education<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.350> that's<00:00:37.500> why<00:00:37.739> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
education first and so that's why I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.850 
education first and so that's why I
decided<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:40.910> my<00:00:41.910> diamond<00:00:42.270> up<00:00:42.390> line<00:00:42.660> is<00:00:43.079> build<00:00:43.620> a
