00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:10.280
 a 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.509
 Euro 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.509
 around 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.050
 a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.050
 gain 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.169
 one 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.890
 Herne 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.480
 maybe benefits 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.769
 that's just the way it is 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.440
 honest and percent 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.750
 Riederich 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.830
 fly more expensive 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.110
 All this happened to Albers and you realize it's done 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.400
 if you look at the book in St 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.440
 maybe a week to be busy 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.130
 to sit in front of this piece of paper 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.440
 that is already the speech 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.030
 Merkel 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.680
 Tasks you then set yourself 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.680
 that is it even after retreat 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.630
 the normal time rhythm actually does not matter anymore 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.020
 you yourself 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.680
 New time 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.480
 too big a word but for my 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.690
 in work clothes 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.700
 We did not know how to do some things from close and tight 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.350
 but not on the greens 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.720
 in position three 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:37.790
 Cell phones or 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:40.500
 computer users 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.100
 that's not soft 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.470
 Progress or have something like that 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 Here I make my own world 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.530
 finally have 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.560
 actually 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.540
 and parent 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.310
 Problem that is exploring or so big 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.460
 They are often coincidences which are so different 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.750
 oil going to a series that secures her working field of 40 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.059
 on a detail municipalities and then out of it 

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:11.469
 the next series 

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:12.320
 developed 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.320
 that already exists 

00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.469
 processed 

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.409
 after that proved close 

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:25.939
 somewhere else 

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:28.139
 must start again 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:29.799
 This is also a big one 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:33.169
 Series arose the newspaper 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:36.409
 disagreements were percent percent for me as a Turk 

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:37.599
 photographs 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:40.599
 from my family 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:44.769
 how much stress that this in the short term 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.829
 anonymous they are they do not advertise any particular human being 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.469
 the one insights 

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.859
 Picture NASA the possibilities your own 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:02:59.519
 how much the health insurance companies 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.519
 especially project 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:10.619
 Aalen 

00:03:15.839 --> 00:03:18.839
 Herne 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:24.719
