00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.820
 The more glitter, the better. 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:06.620
 The perfect combination! 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 It makes your eyes look big! 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.560
 We're supposed to put it on the phones 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560
 but I put it on my forehead. 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.980
 You can not be a princess without your crown. 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:26.460
 And a spoon. 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.360
 Hello ! I am Adora Batbrat and I come from Sweden. 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.800
 What am I doing in life? I am Gothic. 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.940
 I have my own webshop 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.020
 where I sell my own creations like the blouse that I wear 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:46.180
 I created it. 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.460
 I do modeling. 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220
 I sing in a group, 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.900
 bad, but it's fun. 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:52.780
 And today, I'm in Tokyo 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.780
 to meet happy people and do fun things. 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.700
 And that's a nice thing to do. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.120
 Today, I'm going to introduce a makeup tutorial 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.000
 and it will be my own version of a style a little doll? 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.120
 I will try to give everything I have for you 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.660
 Let's go ! Action! 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.560
 I like wearing a very discreet blush, as you can see 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:17.480
 That's what I wear, MakeUp Store Stockholm 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.760
 It's a Swedish brand. 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 I wear their Color Chick. 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.220
 Because I am very chic. 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.080
 To draw my eyebrows in blue, 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.280
 I use this pencil JaneHellen. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.140
 It is also a very good Swedish brand. 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:41.780
 I'm not sure they sell them yet. 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.180
 And for the highlight, 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.200
 I use that. It's actually a liquid foundation, 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.200
 but I like to paint with, 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.800
 I think it's better for that kind of thing. 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.860
 It is not very good as a foundation. 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.600
 It's KRYORAN, and it's a German brand. 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.740
 When I arrived, I already had my foundation in place. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.820
 I like to make a mix between that one, 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.100
 L'Oreal, TRUE MATCH 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 and Illamasqua 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.020
 It is a liquid foundation very very white! 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.040
 The perfect combination! 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.540
 And to complete, 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.280
 as my name is Adora, I use this: 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.820
 it's Swedish brand, IsaDora. 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.340
 It's very clear. 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:20.540
 And for the eyeshadow, 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.940
 I use a green eyeshadow, 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.040
 then I use lip balm 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.040
 to glue the glitter. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.180
 Because I love to shine. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.700
 It's like Kermit the frog. 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560
 So that the eyes come out bigger, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
 I'm applying white here, 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.260
 on both sides. 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.260
 Then white on the bottom of the eyelid, 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.560
 it makes your eyes look asleep! 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.480
 I use two kinds of eyeliner. 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:06.820
 The first can be mixed with water 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.960
 and you can paint with a very fine brush. 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.200
 Like this one ! 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 You can do very long strokes. 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.780
 The second is a waterproof eyeliner. 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.000
 I find it very good. 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.800
 I paint the upper eyelid with and, the small wings. 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.440
 Now I'm applying eyeshadow and brown contouring. 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.480
 I put some here, 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:04.860
 to soften the features, 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.620
 and on my nose to make it look, very very fine, 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.980
 like for a doll. 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.880
 I put it here too, 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.040
 and also on my chin. 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600
 I always wear a diamond here, 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.480
 I wear jewelry all the time in the corner of my eyes. 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:40.900
 If it's big, it's better! 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.680
 This one is actually for phones, 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.760
 We're supposed to put it on the phones 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:49.400
 but I put it on my forehead. 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.580
 The more glitter, the better. 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.980
 For that I use two colors: 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:00.300
 the first is a shimmering pink, for the outer side. 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.720
 And the second is a very bright red. 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:06.340
 It's called, 'Love Affair'. 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.720
 Uh, I have a love affair with my lips. 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.180
 Then you mix them to create a doll's mouth. 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.040
 You can not be a princess without your crown. 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.380
 And a spoon. 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.240
 Just in case you need it. 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:36.460
 I find it nice. 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.480
 'Cheer Up Goth' 

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:41.500
 And also, blood. 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:42.780
 I like blood. 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:44.680
 And a skeleton. 

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.460
 It's nice here. 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.280
 My friend created this, 'Victoria LoveLace' 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:54.280
 To tie my hair, I use that. 

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.420
 I lift everything, and I attach it. 

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.440
 And it's all good! I'm finished ! 

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.320
 I look good? 

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.840
 Well that's the look I created for you today. 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:13.300
 And there will be a little interview with me too. 

00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.120
 Subscribe to my Youtube channel, it's AdoraBatBrat 

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:21.560
 there will be bonus videos today 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.080
 and all my days in Japan. 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:26.900
 We film a little with my travel partner, Simon 

00:06:27.220 --> 00:06:29.960
 and we will keep you informed of what is going on here in Tokyo! 

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:30.980
 Thank you so much ! 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.760
 And let the vampires bite you. 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:45.660
 Today, we filmed a lot of videos with Adora 

00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.100
 but, things have changed, she is behind the camera! 

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:51.140
 Here it is ! She is filming! 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.980
 So, how did you end up here? 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.800
 Oh my god, it's a long story ... 

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:59.040
 Cathy Cat and BatBrat! 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:05.740
 Go on their channel but do not forget to subscribe to this channel! 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.840
 It's AdoraBatBrat! 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.680
 I want to do more ... 

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:11.560
 It's ok to do more? 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.880
 Of course ! Go ahead ! 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240
 Oh, and the eyeshadow ... 

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:19.660
 Kermit's eyes! 

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:20.440
 I love Kermit. 

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.060
 Your eyes are already very big. 

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.940
 You see, I really have a very fine nose now. 

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.620
 He escapes... 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.560
 And now, it's the fun part ... 

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.680
 Glitter ! Diamonds ! 

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:40.960
 This is my favorite part! 

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:43.300
 What is your favorite color ? 

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.920
 Pink. 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.240
 It's embarassing ! 

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.100
 I try to be cool and Gothic but I like pink. 

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:57.520
 I love pink. 

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:00.640
 I should say black but, 

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.340
 it's the rose, I can not lie to you.
