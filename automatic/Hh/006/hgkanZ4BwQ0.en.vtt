00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:08.649
 friends I do not intend to talk about the 

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:08.649
 liver cleansing let's see 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.800
 yesterday we saw that it was a question and is 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:16.590
 to loom for me that is practiced now 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.310
 let's see the procedure for 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:23.269
 perform liver cleansing 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.269
 first of all what you have to 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.269
 wait 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.470
 the benefits that you will get to 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.720
 through this basic cleaning are 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.160
 Many 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.460
 because they are many because you 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.180
 will cleanse your body in a way 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:45.370
 easy simple and economical 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.829
 all they have to think about is 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.859
 stay clean 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:54.079
 try to carry some parameters that 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:56.440
 they are going to help you to make this a 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.440
 success 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.929
 does not mean that I am against 

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:06.680
 consume meats not to consume milk 

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.680
 but drink coffee 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.869
 and you remember the book that you 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.990
 will show iron from andrea's morris 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.689
 express why 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.810
 it is good to stop using these 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.810
 foods 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:29.770
 it also expresses that one owes the maximum and 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:33.900
 try to avoid consuming things like 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.260
 red meat the fish the chicken 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:39.090
 but also recommends that you do not 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.970
 I can do it once because it would be 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.050
 illogical then dedicated 47 years 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.120
 consuming meat 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.930
 and stop once and for all stop 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.610
 consume 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.980
 but you can not go to a store 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.290
 gradually 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:57.110
 then the recommendation is the 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:01.690
 next during the week 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.940
 of preparation for liver cleansing 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.170
 stop eating eat meat 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:11.440
 stop eating milk 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.360
 try to eat the most I kill it is 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.360
 possible is preferable 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.320
 like vegetables legumes 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.540
 this is in order that when you 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.290
 you are taking the malic acid that 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.209
 you took a quarter of a spoon 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.890
 this malic acid and dissolves it in a 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.450
 liter of water 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.520
 he takes it for 6 days 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.440
 during those six days what is 

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.230
 doing is allowing which 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.470
 grow now 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.770
 and malic acid the function is to make 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:51.950
 that the stones that are in the liver 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:54.860
 come out soft makes them soft 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.290
 in order that at the time of the 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.060
 you are not going to cover any 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.760
 internal injury 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.430
 and you lose badly because they are hard but at 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.860
 soften them with the bad bark and with a 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.140
 increase going out they are not going to affect 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.050
 in nothing at all 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:17.410
 then for six days it is taken by 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:19.780
 Sips a liter of water and with a 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:21.120
 quarter of a spoonful you will hear 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.930
 adulteress 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.930
 malic acid 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.880
 this is done for six days the sixth 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:33.310
 day 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.710
 you usually eat the dead and 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:40.620
 when maximum until one and a half of the 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.620
 late can consume solid foods 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.700
 this is why 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.700
 we need to have a clean colon 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:52.040
 and our 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:54.200
 and empty stomach 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.060
 because it is not recommended to eat take 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.010
 milk because the milk in you takes 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.680
 milk during these days the day of the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.620
 cleanliness is to say the day is this you 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.860
 may have dizziness vomiting 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:09.799
 this is why it is not recommended to have 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:12.020
 lactose in the body turn the body 

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.590
 would need 

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:18.859
 well and what would the body do 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:22.710
 concentrate on digesting this and him 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:25.010
 allow the stones of an 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:29.260
 in white decide 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:29.260
 that's why it's not advisable to take 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:35.430
 milk during these days avoid 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:38.070
 anything that contains milk 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:43.060
 then at six in the afternoon you 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:46.419
 Take three glasses of filtered water 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.529
 and four tablespoons of leaves the 

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:50.409
 Sun 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:53.169
 to dissolve this fun is divided into 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:55.449
 four portions 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:58.580
 and the first portion is taken to data from 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:05:01.190
 the afternoon at 10 o'clock in the evening sorry 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.060
 you take this what it does 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.500
 comment with your cleaning to have 

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:08.810
 tortured 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:11.830
 bathroom three or four times with the script 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:16.020
 water is why it is recommended 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:18.509
 Eat hard during this day 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:19.830
 at 8 at night he takes the second 

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:23.270

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.849
 between 2 and 4 water exposures 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:31.899
 liquid 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.899
 at that moment
