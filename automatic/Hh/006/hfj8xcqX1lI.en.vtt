16<00:00:29.580> steps<00:00:30.119> but<00:00:30.539> that<00:00:30.720> I<00:00:30.779> think<00:00:30.810> that<00:00:31.109> just

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
16 steps but that I think that just

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.889 
16 steps but that I think that just
depends<00:00:31.590> on<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.980> way<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.130> change<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
depends on the way you change it it

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.569 
depends on the way you change it it
could<00:00:34.110> be<00:00:34.230> different<00:00:34.469> for<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:34.890> and<00:00:35.100> then

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
could be different for you and then

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.790 
could be different for you and then
there<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.719> little<00:00:36.840> paragraph<00:00:37.440> they<00:00:37.680> have

now these two hours this is the swords
and<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.190> guess<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.760> a<00:00:59.850> storage<00:01:00.239> but

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
and that I guess it's a storage but

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.349 
and that I guess it's a storage but
honestly<00:01:00.899> it's<00:01:01.199> really<00:01:02.010> really<00:01:02.370> weird<00:01:02.670> just

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
honestly it's really really weird just

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.810 
honestly it's really really weird just
our<00:01:03.539> swords<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.769> side<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> him<00:01:05.369> because<00:01:05.700> it

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
our swords on the side of him because it

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.280 
our swords on the side of him because it
kind<00:01:06.000> of<00:01:06.030> looks<00:01:06.180> like<00:01:06.270> he's<00:01:06.570> being<00:01:06.750> stabbed

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
kind of looks like he's being stabbed

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.550 
kind of looks like he's being stabbed
instead<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.610> being<00:01:08.880> medicine<00:01:09.560> and

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
and it is a little bit difficult to

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.920 
and it is a little bit difficult to
transform<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.549> guy<00:01:41.759> because<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.329> lot<00:01:42.720> of<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
transform this guy because a lot of the

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.679 
transform this guy because a lot of the
things<00:01:43.229> kind<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.860> run<00:01:44.729> into<00:01:45.060> each<00:01:45.180> other<00:01:45.360> in<00:01:45.509> a

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
things kind of run into each other in a

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.810 
things kind of run into each other in a
way<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.110> you'll<00:01:46.649> see<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:46.950> when<00:01:47.220> i<00:01:47.280> try<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.579> do

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
way and you'll see that when i try to do

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
way and you'll see that when i try to do
this<00:01:47.939> all<00:01:48.210> right<00:01:48.240> now<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> first<00:01:49.470> thing<00:01:49.649> I

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
this all right now the first thing I

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.770 
this all right now the first thing I
usually<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.430> is<00:01:53.119> first<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.240> all<00:01:54.270> move<00:01:54.479> up<00:01:54.600> this

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
usually do is first of all move up this

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.690 
usually do is first of all move up this
tail<00:01:55.170> and<00:01:55.439> you're<00:01:55.560> going<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> fold<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.399> up

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
tail and you're going to fold that up

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.690 
tail and you're going to fold that up
just<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.840> can<00:01:57.990> get<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.259> out<00:01:58.380> of<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.500> way

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:58.700 
just like I can get that out of the way

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.240 
just like I can get that out of the way
then<00:01:59.700> you're<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.899> move<00:02:01.350> these<00:02:01.560> down<00:02:01.890> I

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
then you're going to move these down I

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.060 
then you're going to move these down I

just bend down now things do kind of run
into<00:03:02.170> each<00:03:02.290> other<00:03:02.440> so<00:03:02.740> forewarning<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.870> got

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:04.990 
into each other so forewarning just got

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:06.780 
into each other so forewarning just got
to<00:03:05.080> be<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.200> little<00:03:05.410> bit<00:03:05.530> careful<00:03:05.860> it<00:03:06.370> bends

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
to be a little bit careful it bends

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.430

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.409 
these holes just kind of shove them in
there<00:04:23.490> but<00:04:24.490> i<00:04:24.640> think<00:04:24.850> that<00:04:24.880> double<00:04:25.240> sword

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
there but i think that double sword

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:26.310 
there but i think that double sword
thing<00:04:25.660> isn't<00:04:25.900> all

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
thing isn't all

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:27.720 
thing isn't all
some<00:04:26.410> idea<00:04:26.710> they<00:04:26.980> think<00:04:27.280> they<00:04:27.370> need<00:04:27.520> better

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730 
some idea they think they need better

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
some idea they think they need better
storage<00:04:28.090> in<00:04:28.390> the<00:04:28.510> Dino<00:04:29.200> mode<00:04:30.450> but<00:04:31.450> then<00:04:31.600> it's

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
storage in the Dino mode but then it's

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.680 
storage in the Dino mode but then it's
pretty<00:04:32.050> much<00:04:32.820> that<00:04:33.820> is<00:04:33.940> pretty<00:04:34.060> much<00:04:34.270> slug

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
pretty much that is pretty much slug

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.170 
pretty much that is pretty much slug
he's<00:04:35.530> pretty<00:04:35.830> cool<00:04:36.040> I<00:04:36.250> like<00:04:36.550> him<00:04:36.760> like<00:04:36.880> I<00:04:37.000> said

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
he's pretty cool I like him like I said

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.880 
he's pretty cool I like him like I said
I<00:04:37.210> think<00:04:37.510> they<00:04:37.630> needed<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:38.320> kind<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.680> make<00:04:38.860> a

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
I think they needed to kind of make a

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.740 
I think they needed to kind of make a
better<00:04:39.220> way<00:04:39.430> of<00:04:39.460> storing<00:04:39.910> those<00:04:40.150> swords<00:04:40.570> and

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
better way of storing those swords and

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.800 
better way of storing those swords and
just<00:04:40.870> plain<00:04:41.170> weird<00:04:41.610> but<00:04:42.610> overall<00:04:43.210> he's<00:04:43.570> pretty

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
just plain weird but overall he's pretty

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.850 
just plain weird but overall he's pretty
cool<00:04:44.670> just<00:04:45.670> very<00:04:45.940> very<00:04:46.270> claustrophobic<00:04:47.140> in

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
cool just very very claustrophobic in

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.190 
cool just very very claustrophobic in
the<00:04:48.010> parts<00:04:48.400> it's<00:04:48.640> they<00:04:49.300> tend<00:04:49.690> to<00:04:49.750> run<00:04:49.930> into

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
the parts it's they tend to run into

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.380 
the parts it's they tend to run into
each<00:04:50.320> other<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:50.920> not<00:04:51.550> be<00:04:51.700> a<00:04:51.730> little<00:04:52.150> bit

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:52.390 
each other so not be a little bit

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.970 
each other so not be a little bit
careful<00:04:52.570> when<00:04:52.900> you're<00:04:52.990> doing<00:04:53.260> him<00:04:53.380> but<00:04:53.620> all

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:53.980
