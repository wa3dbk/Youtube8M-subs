all of the new slime blocks are

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.509 
all of the new slime blocks are
introduced<00:00:24.750> this<00:00:25.289> build<00:00:25.560> has<00:00:25.680> got<00:00:26.070> a<00:00:26.279> whole

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
introduced this build has got a whole

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849 
introduced this build has got a whole
bunch<00:00:26.670> better<00:00:26.939> not<00:00:27.660> only<00:00:27.990> is<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.140> now<00:00:28.349> faster

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
bunch better not only is it now faster

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.439 
bunch better not only is it now faster
it's<00:00:29.220> also<00:00:29.400> got<00:00:29.670> some<00:00:29.699> added<00:00:30.060> functionality

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
it's also got some added functionality

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.420 
it's also got some added functionality
which<00:00:30.869> is<00:00:30.990> always<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.470> thing<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.219> let's

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
which is always a good thing so let's

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.000 
which is always a good thing so let's
take<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> closer<00:00:32.880> look<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.210> it<00:00:33.710> one<00:00:34.710> of<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.890> main

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
take a closer look at it one of the main

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.410 
take a closer look at it one of the main
problems<00:00:35.460> that<00:00:35.550> people<00:00:35.760> had<00:00:36.030> with<00:00:36.239> my

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
problems that people had with my

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.420 
problems that people had with my
original<00:00:36.630> 4x4<00:00:37.440> volt<00:00:37.680> door<00:00:37.829> designs<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.309> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
original 4x4 volt door designs is the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.799 
original 4x4 volt door designs is the
fact<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.700> on<00:00:38.879> one<00:00:39.090> side<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.629> looks

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
fact that on one side it looks

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.510 
fact that on one side it looks
absolutely<00:00:40.020> brilliant<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:40.890> then<00:00:41.309> on<00:00:41.430> the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
absolutely brilliant and then on the

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.889 
absolutely brilliant and then on the
other<00:00:41.550> side<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.300> didn't<00:00:42.540> look<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.870> good

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
other side it didn't look so good

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.290 
other side it didn't look so good
they're<00:00:43.379> exposed<00:00:43.829> Pistons<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.550> no<00:00:44.940> one<00:00:45.090> likes

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
they're exposed Pistons and no one likes

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.400 
they're exposed Pistons and no one likes
seeing<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.690> sort<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:45.989> thing

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
seeing that sort of thing

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.229 
seeing that sort of thing
so<00:00:46.770> I've<00:00:47.039> decided<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.579> change<00:00:47.760> things<00:00:48.000> up<00:00:48.180> a

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
so I've decided to change things up a

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:49.970 
so I've decided to change things up a
little<00:00:48.329> bit<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.629> as<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> can<00:00:49.050> see<00:00:49.200> this<00:00:49.710> door

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
little bit and as you can see this door

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.590 
little bit and as you can see this door
looks<00:00:50.190> exactly<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.640> same<00:00:50.700> from<00:00:51.059> both<00:00:51.239> sides

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
looks exactly the same from both sides

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.270 
looks exactly the same from both sides
meaning<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.289> whatever<00:00:52.530> angle<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.070> take<00:00:53.250> a

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
meaning that whatever angle you take a

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.979 
meaning that whatever angle you take a
look<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.610> from<00:00:53.730> it's<00:00:54.329> gonna<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.690> looking

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
look at it from it's gonna be looking

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:56.689 
look at it from it's gonna be looking
good<00:00:55.170> but<00:00:55.440> anyway<00:00:55.530> if<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:55.980> give<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> a<00:00:56.370> real

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
good but anyway if we give this a real

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.340 
good but anyway if we give this a real
quick<00:00:56.910> tester<00:00:57.270> flick<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.899> even<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.260> you

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
quick tester flick this even here you

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.660 
quick tester flick this even here you
will<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.739> is<00:00:58.890> still<00:00:59.100> got<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
will see it is still got the

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.430 
will see it is still got the
lightning-fast<00:01:00.420> opening<00:01:00.989> sequence

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
lightning-fast opening sequence

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.560 
lightning-fast opening sequence
absolutely<00:01:02.280> incredible<00:01:02.730> how<00:01:02.910> fast<00:01:03.180> this<00:01:03.359> door

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
absolutely incredible how fast this door

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.990 
absolutely incredible how fast this door
opens<00:01:03.960> and<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.439> closing<00:01:04.680> sequence<00:01:05.040> isn't<00:01:05.820> too

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
opens and the closing sequence isn't too

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780 
opens and the closing sequence isn't too
bad<00:01:06.150> either<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.830> far<00:01:07.830> as<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.310> redstone<00:01:08.670> is

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
bad either as far as the redstone is

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.640 
bad either as far as the redstone is
concerned<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.420> build<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:09.930> pretty<00:01:10.229> compact

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
concerned this build is pretty compact

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.320 
concerned this build is pretty compact
as<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.189> see<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.490> only<00:01:11.520> three<00:01:11.909> blocks<00:01:12.119> deep

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
as you can see is only three blocks deep

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.000 
as you can see is only three blocks deep
which<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.930> would<00:01:13.080> say<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.439> fairly<00:01:13.740> impressive

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
which I would say is fairly impressive

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.679 
which I would say is fairly impressive
especially<00:01:14.729> considering<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.360> complicated

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
especially considering how complicated

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.230 
especially considering how complicated
the<00:01:16.049> mechanism<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.680> however<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.670> space<00:01:17.939> is<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
the mechanism is however if space is a

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.149 
the mechanism is however if space is a
bit<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> priority<00:01:18.990> for<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:19.500> then<00:01:19.979> this

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
bit of a priority for you then this

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.160 
bit of a priority for you then this
build<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.610> actually<00:01:20.759> two<00:01:21.119> blocks<00:01:21.360> wider<00:01:21.630> than

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
build is actually two blocks wider than

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
build is actually two blocks wider than
the<00:01:22.290> original<00:01:22.710> one<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.009> uploaded<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.700> if

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
the original one that I uploaded so if

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.100 
the original one that I uploaded so if
you<00:01:23.939> do<00:01:24.030> want<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.210> check<00:01:24.390> out<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.570> original<00:01:24.990> a

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
you do want to check out the original a

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.390 
you do want to check out the original a
link<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.040> down<00:01:26.189> in<00:01:26.369> the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
link to that will be down in the

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.219 
link to that will be down in the
description<00:01:26.540> another<00:01:27.540> quick<00:01:27.810> thing<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.170> I

00:04:54.910 --> 00:04:56.430 
to give it a quick test all you have to
do<00:04:55.030> is<00:04:55.240> head<00:04:55.420> down<00:04:55.540> to<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.750> bottom<00:04:56.050> for<00:04:56.410> a
