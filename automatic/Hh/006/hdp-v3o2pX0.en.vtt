on the Ducati Diavel pretty excited from
what<00:00:14.639> I've<00:00:14.700> read<00:00:14.849> it's<00:00:15.059> a<00:00:15.480> bit<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:15.990> demon

to<00:00:19.080> obviously<00:00:19.650> I'm<00:00:19.859> more<00:00:20.340> involved<00:00:20.430> with

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
to obviously I'm more involved with

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.450 
to obviously I'm more involved with
sports<00:00:20.910> bikes<00:00:21.240> and<00:00:21.420> dirt<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:22.189> maybe<00:00:23.189> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.430> a

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
sports bikes and dirt so maybe this is a

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.790 
sports bikes and dirt so maybe this is a
bit<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.760> mix<00:00:24.119> in<00:00:24.269> between<00:00:24.300> I<00:00:24.960> do<00:00:25.439> love<00:00:25.710> the

so<00:00:29.390> I'm<00:00:30.390> off<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.750> fission<00:00:31.619> motorcycles<00:00:32.250> right

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
so I'm off to fission motorcycles right

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.240 
so I'm off to fission motorcycles right
now<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:33.110> test<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.260> so<00:00:34.469> I'll<00:00:34.860> give<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.100> full
