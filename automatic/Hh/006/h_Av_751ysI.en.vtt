I've seen on some see anchors and stuff
like<00:00:58.210> that<00:00:58.449> then<00:00:59.289> of<00:00:59.440> course<00:00:59.710> like<00:00:59.769> Rothko<00:01:00.219> and

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
like that then of course like Rothko and

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.680 
like that then of course like Rothko and
stuff<00:01:00.550> like<00:01:00.699> that<00:01:00.850> they<00:01:01.000> have<00:01:01.120> bazillion

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
stuff like that they have bazillion

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.040 
stuff like that they have bazillion
different<00:01:01.780> colors<00:01:02.320> but<00:01:03.449> it<00:01:04.449> has<00:01:04.629> anywhere

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.050 
different colors but it has anywhere

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.840 
different colors but it has anywhere
from<00:01:05.170> five<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.470> seven<00:01:05.620> strands<00:01:06.040> I've<00:01:06.460> never

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
from five to seven strands I've never

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.370 
from five to seven strands I've never
seen<00:01:07.060> one<00:01:07.180> of<00:01:07.300> five<00:01:07.450> that's<00:01:07.630> always<00:01:07.810> been<00:01:08.020> 7

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
seen one of five that's always been 7

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.700 
seen one of five that's always been 7
these<00:01:09.240> breakdown<00:01:10.240> there's<00:01:11.049> always<00:01:11.290> one<00:01:11.560> that

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
these breakdown there's always one that

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.510 
these breakdown there's always one that
is<00:01:11.860> colored<00:01:16.320> but<00:01:17.320> supposedly<00:01:17.979> denotes<00:01:18.400> the

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
is colored but supposedly denotes the

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.969 
is colored but supposedly denotes the
manufacturer<00:01:19.560> for<00:01:20.560> what<00:01:20.710> that's<00:01:20.829> worth

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
manufacturer for what that's worth

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.039 
manufacturer for what that's worth
anyway<00:01:21.729> these<00:01:22.060> once<00:01:22.600> you<00:01:22.689> break<00:01:22.840> these<00:01:22.990> down

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
anyway these once you break these down

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.200 
anyway these once you break these down
they're<00:01:23.350> right<00:01:23.619> around<00:01:23.829> 35<00:01:24.670> pound<00:01:24.939> test

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
they're right around 35 pound test

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.609 
they're right around 35 pound test
obviously<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.840> can<00:01:25.990> use<00:01:26.079> them<00:01:26.200> for<00:01:26.229> a

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
obviously we can use them for a

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.139 
obviously we can use them for a
bazillion<00:01:27.130> different<00:01:27.460> things<00:01:27.640> fishing

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:28.149 
bazillion different things fishing

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.139 
bazillion different things fishing
sewing<00:01:28.630> the<00:01:29.350> list<00:01:29.560> goes<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:29.890> and<00:01:30.100> on<00:01:30.159> well

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
sewing the list goes on and on well

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:34.469 
sewing the list goes on and on well
let's<00:01:31.180> take<00:01:31.780> all<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.430> spinner<00:01:33.430> lines<00:01:34.180> out

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
let's take all that spinner lines out

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:35.429 
let's take all that spinner lines out
the<00:01:34.689> sheath<00:01:34.869> actually<00:01:35.200> becomes

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
the sheath actually becomes

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.310 
the sheath actually becomes
approximately<00:01:35.890> 220<00:01:36.430> pounds<00:01:36.759> so<00:01:37.270> real<00:01:38.020> world

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
approximately 220 pounds so real world

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.370 
approximately 220 pounds so real world
real<00:01:38.829> situation<00:01:39.460> strip<00:01:40.420> away<00:01:40.509> 550<00:01:41.049> cord<00:01:41.200> out

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
real situation strip away 550 cord out

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.840 
real situation strip away 550 cord out
break<00:01:41.950> it<00:01:42.100> down<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.250> can<00:01:42.399> actually<00:01:42.759> do

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:42.850 
break it down you can actually do

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.830 
break it down you can actually do
lashings<00:01:43.360> with<00:01:43.869> 35<00:01:44.320> pound<00:01:44.649> test<00:01:45.420> for<00:01:46.420> shelters

lashings with 35 pound test for shelters

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.300 
lashings with 35 pound test for shelters
and<00:01:46.960> stuff<00:01:47.170> like<00:01:47.289> that<00:01:47.560> because<00:01:47.890> really<00:01:48.159> if

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
and stuff like that because really if

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.200 
and stuff like that because really if
you<00:01:48.369> think<00:01:48.430> about<00:01:48.670> some<00:01:48.939> of<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.090> natural

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
you think about some of the natural

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:50.880 
you think about some of the natural
cordage<00:01:49.659> we<00:01:49.780> do<00:01:49.899> really<00:01:50.079> isn't<00:01:50.320> that<00:01:50.590> much

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
cordage we do really isn't that much

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.529 
cordage we do really isn't that much
more<00:01:51.539> so<00:01:52.539> anyway<00:01:53.130> all<00:01:54.130> right<00:01:54.880> setting<00:01:55.390> up<00:01:55.450> a

usually about four of this length this

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:22.600 
usually about four of this length this
is<00:02:18.500> one<00:02:18.770> of<00:02:18.830> the<00:02:18.890> ones<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.190> use<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:19.430> most<00:02:21.490> like<00:02:22.490> I

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
stuff like that that's a perfect length

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.720 
stuff like that that's a perfect length
for<00:02:47.450> tying<00:02:47.810> off<00:02:48.020> with<00:02:48.260> first<00:02:48.709> date<00:02:49.010> so<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.550> is

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
for tying off with first date so this is

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.190 
for tying off with first date so this is
the<00:02:49.880> length<00:02:50.300> I<00:02:50.450> use<00:02:50.660> the<00:02:50.780> most

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
the length I use the most

the length I use the most
I<00:02:51.350> like<00:02:52.190> keeping<00:02:52.489> them<00:02:52.640> in<00:02:52.790> what's<00:02:52.970> called<00:02:53.120> a

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
I like keeping them in what's called a

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.870 
I like keeping them in what's called a
daisy<00:02:53.450> chain<00:02:53.630> you<00:02:54.380> guys<00:02:54.770> that<00:02:55.040> do

daisy chain you guys that do

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.910 
daisy chain you guys that do
construction<00:02:56.150> kind<00:02:56.720> of<00:02:56.810> know<00:02:56.930> what<00:02:57.650> the<00:02:57.770> deal

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920 
construction kind of know what the deal

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.180 
construction kind of know what the deal
is<00:02:57.980> with<00:02:58.130> this<00:02:58.510> even<00:02:59.510> up<00:02:59.600> your<00:02:59.720> ends<00:03:00.080> and<00:03:01.070> all

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
is with this even up your ends and all

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.180 
is with this even up your ends and all
this<00:03:01.340> is<00:03:01.550> a<00:03:01.580> series<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.270> slip<00:03:02.870> knots<00:03:03.110> all<00:03:04.040> right

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
this is a series of slip knots all right

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.479 
this is a series of slip knots all right
I'm<00:03:04.880> gonna<00:03:05.000> make<00:03:05.209> a<00:03:05.420> loop<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.130> bring<00:03:07.130> an<00:03:07.310> end

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
I'm gonna make a loop and bring an end

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.580 
I'm gonna make a loop and bring an end
up<00:03:07.640> through<00:03:07.880> and<00:03:08.330> that<00:03:08.420> becomes<00:03:08.720> a<00:03:08.810> slip<00:03:09.049> knot

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
up through and that becomes a slip knot

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.900 
up through and that becomes a slip knot
alright<00:03:09.920> comes<00:03:10.700> out<00:03:10.989> so<00:03:11.989> make<00:03:12.260> a<00:03:12.290> loop<00:03:12.910> bring

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
alright comes out so make a loop bring

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.180 
alright comes out so make a loop bring
it<00:03:14.030> through<00:03:14.500> then<00:03:15.500> I'm<00:03:15.590> gonna<00:03:15.709> take<00:03:15.890> a<00:03:15.920> bite

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
it through then I'm gonna take a bite

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.729 
it through then I'm gonna take a bite
pass<00:03:16.880> it<00:03:17.090> through<00:03:17.209> there<00:03:17.470> pull<00:03:18.470> it<00:03:18.590> down

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
pass it through there pull it down

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.370 
pass it through there pull it down
another<00:03:19.280> bite<00:03:19.660> passes<00:03:20.660> through<00:03:20.780> there<00:03:20.930> pull

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
another bite passes through there pull

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:24.009 
another bite passes through there pull
it<00:03:21.440> down<00:03:21.680> and<00:03:22.130> the<00:03:22.220> last<00:03:22.549> one<00:03:22.880> I'm<00:03:23.780> going<00:03:23.930> to

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
it down and the last one I'm going to

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:25.330 
it down and the last one I'm going to
come<00:03:24.170> all<00:03:24.410> the<00:03:24.530> way<00:03:24.560> through<00:03:24.860> with<00:03:25.040> all<00:03:25.190> of

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
come all the way through with all of

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.990 
come all the way through with all of
them<00:03:25.430> that<00:03:25.910> locks<00:03:26.120> very<00:03:27.100> good<00:03:28.130> you<00:03:28.730> get<00:03:28.880> the

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 
them that locks very good you get the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.320 
them that locks very good you get the
idea

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
idea

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.000 
idea
undo<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:29.930> all<00:03:30.140> we're<00:03:30.230> gonna<00:03:30.320> do<00:03:30.440> is<00:03:30.470> undo<00:03:30.890> the

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
undo it all we're gonna do is undo the

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.789 
undo it all we're gonna do is undo the
last<00:03:31.220> one<00:03:31.489> and<00:03:32.209> pull<00:03:32.420> it<00:03:32.540> out<00:03:32.630> so<00:03:33.440> it's<00:03:33.620> real

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
last one and pull it out so it's real

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:36.520 
last one and pull it out so it's real
simple<00:03:34.040> real<00:03:34.940> easy<00:03:35.019> if<00:03:36.019> you<00:03:36.170> have<00:03:36.200> one<00:03:36.470> that's

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
simple real easy if you have one that's

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.180 
simple real easy if you have one that's
too<00:03:36.739> long

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
too long

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.430 
too long
you<00:03:37.430> can<00:03:37.549> actually<00:03:37.640> double<00:03:38.120> it<00:03:38.209> over<00:03:38.480> all

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
you can actually double it over all

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.350 
you can actually double it over all
right<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.340> works<00:03:40.519> real<00:03:40.700> well<00:03:40.730> too<00:03:41.120> so

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
right so that works real well too so

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.000 
right so that works real well too so
we're<00:03:41.930> talking<00:03:42.200> about<00:03:42.260> some<00:03:42.470> uses<00:03:42.769> for<00:03:42.920> that

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
we're talking about some uses for that

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.949 
we're talking about some uses for that
