 how do you get this fear topics the 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.680
 pretty safe to get out without that 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.109
 have the same level experience same 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.170
 will be very small 18 seconds 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:03.250
 matchball 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.059
 I can not count but catch now 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.280
 still on 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.039
 one can indeed wait oh well we 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.690
 on this server natural protection and 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:12.729
 removal with mourning to me 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.250
 interested only times not about us 

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.009
 because that's not great, of course 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.420
 thing but you can do it all elegant 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:23.560
 is clear 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.820
 you know the system and it offers 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.450
 natural advantages 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.400
 unfortunately not one hundred percent 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.840
 automatic benefits 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
 but maybe one or more 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.729
 other user whether it's one or me 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.000
 Anyway, we can do something here very much 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:43.000
 interesting was 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:46.810
 we can with our material we 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.960
 have and a strong recipe namely there 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.869
 where the ingolstadt to the theme of this 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.210
 recipe is here in the back of the smb 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.270
 cameron 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:01.360
 There the recipe is clear with an iron 

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.340
 division siegl and a thailand and 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.649
 I can do that over here now 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:08.049
 let our existence be produced 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:10.119
 but I can do that too 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:10.539
 make our crafting appointment 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.450
 to let 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.910
 creating terminal means i have here 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.670
 prepared something with the glass 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.920
 then here this item glass to 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.930
 to get 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.100
 now I forces once such a 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.960
 image an officially none of even several 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.720
 forces that we would look at the same 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.300
 you see here is yours will not 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.870
 as or at least that's not me 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:40.300
 the noticed is only then if 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.850
 you take it out of the inventory 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.430
 but it no use to us in here to 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.650
 nothing happens he has to do it once 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.440
 have actually left the inventory 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.960
 then he begins to age and in the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.180
 time where he is not there yet 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.040
 you rauswÃ¤hlen this now you can 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.290
 drive to the whole peak 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.860
 Let's see how many manufacturers each 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:04.180
 several with 345 are supposedly 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.690
 do not want to get stuck 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.950
 but they are and because they are 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.320
 Let's just go for a few 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.110
 Take out briefly in our inventory 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.190
 Tour until an old age and already 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.960
 Here we have the charity 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.420
 can go out and in this way and 

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.820
 We can make you very comfortable 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.740
 is the once out then then once 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:26.920
 In this way we can do a lot 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.620
 comfortable and without us big risks 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.110
 exposing our materials to forces 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:35.080
 I hope this short tutorial has you 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.730
 what set to the e-mail system I have 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.050
 could have already been made abundantly 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.510
 away her cake all my good 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.480
 networked all links to the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.580
 individual tutorials and the typical 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.250
 So I already have that seal 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:51.160
 and we have made this case 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:53.350
 done done glass that is yes 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:55.360
 a very nice thing this money can 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.690
 I'm building that tonight 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:00.880
 at least a little something to say about it 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:04.150
 this is not social glass you can do that 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.870
 go through but there comes only 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.490
 player through and no mox that means 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.010
 You can also do the fashion one 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:15.310
 to build comfortable houses for a year 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:17.520
 and also by chance or otherwise like that 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:20.770
 can not annoy one because then 

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:22.750
 that was a super short again 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:24.430
 tutorial I hope you enjoyed it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.200
 if so, I should use this channel 

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.720
 subscribe because it keeps coming back 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.780
 new ideas not only from me too 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:33.430
 Players replace every channel and that 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.190
 is just the book again list project 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.810
 Many people are involved and 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.480
 somehow the whole thing always finds its own 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:42.760
 channel on this youtube channel 

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.800
 my way him and send a great 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.720
 have a cool thing over the years 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.460
 we will be a few soon 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:49.870
 updates make up to and the one 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.170
 or others because here are a few 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.320
 recipes have become different and perfect 

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:57.700
 the modern left it but that 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.630
 we'll still have it 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.370
 much ahead 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.350
 you have no idea how 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:04.450
 boring the researcher ran until then 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.490
 all a lot of fun with my existing ones 

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.520
 tutorials 109 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:10.750
 and we will continue to the art 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.260
 and have a lot of fun
