Wow<00:01:41.560> and<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.310> one<00:01:42.490> has<00:01:42.640> 11<00:01:43.120> strings<00:01:43.600> it's

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
Wow and this one has 11 strings it's

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.370 
Wow and this one has 11 strings it's
patterned<00:01:44.560> after<00:01:44.680> the<00:01:44.890> arabic<00:01:45.340> food<00:01:45.580> and

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
patterned after the arabic food and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.719 
patterned after the arabic food and
basically<00:01:47.380> you<00:01:47.799> have<00:01:47.979> a<00:01:48.010> single<00:01:48.370> string<00:01:48.580> on

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:48.729 
basically you have a single string on

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:50.789 
basically you have a single string on
the<00:01:48.820> bottom<00:01:49.180> and<00:01:49.270> then<00:01:49.420> double<00:01:49.750> courses<00:01:50.260> up<00:01:50.560> to

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:50.799 
the bottom and then double courses up to

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:52.710 
the bottom and then double courses up to
the<00:01:50.920> top<00:01:51.100> so<00:01:51.670> I<00:01:51.700> would<00:01:51.909> imagine<00:01:52.000> it's<00:01:52.450> a<00:01:52.540> lot

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
the top so I would imagine it's a lot

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.170 
the top so I would imagine it's a lot
harder<00:01:53.170> to<00:01:53.500> play<00:01:53.710> than<00:01:53.950> a<00:01:53.979> regular<00:01:54.220> yeah<00:01:54.790> yeah

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
harder to play than a regular yeah yeah

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.570 
harder to play than a regular yeah yeah
it<00:01:55.690> causes<00:01:56.290> a<00:01:56.320> lot<00:01:56.470> them<00:01:56.620> a<00:01:56.680> lot<00:01:56.830> more<00:01:56.950> problems

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
it causes a lot them a lot more problems

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.780 
it causes a lot them a lot more problems
yeah<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:59.170> I<00:01:59.770> have<00:01:59.979> other<00:02:00.190> ones<00:02:00.460> that<00:02:00.640> I've
