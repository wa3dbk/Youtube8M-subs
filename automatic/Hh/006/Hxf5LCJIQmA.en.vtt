I've<00:01:58.490> kept<00:01:59.490> my<00:01:59.579> cam<00:02:00.000> sprocket<00:02:00.689> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.020> chain

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
I've kept my cam sprocket on the chain

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.289 
I've kept my cam sprocket on the chain
and<00:02:01.530> I<00:02:01.740> haven't<00:02:02.040> moved<00:02:02.219> any<00:02:02.549> teeth<00:02:02.820> around<00:02:02.969> and

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
and I haven't moved any teeth around and

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.700 
and I haven't moved any teeth around and
I<00:02:03.360> made<00:02:03.540> sure<00:02:03.719> no<00:02:03.899> teeth<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.290> slipped<00:02:04.560> down

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
I made sure no teeth have slipped down

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.859 
I made sure no teeth have slipped down
the<00:02:04.740> bottom<00:02:05.130> knee<00:02:05.909> as<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.420> can<00:02:06.570> see<00:02:06.750> I've<00:02:06.840> just

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the bottom knee as you can see I've just

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.410 
the bottom knee as you can see I've just
put<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.459> socket<00:02:08.459> set<00:02:08.610> patient

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
put a socket set patient

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.930 
put a socket set patient
stop<00:02:09.810> it<00:02:09.929> from<00:02:10.080> falling<00:02:10.140> in<00:02:10.649> so<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.640> means

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
stop it from falling in so that means

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.990 
stop it from falling in so that means
that<00:02:12.210> I've<00:02:13.170> got<00:02:13.230> at<00:02:13.470> top<00:02:13.920> dead<00:02:14.100> center<00:02:14.520> on<00:02:14.700> the

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
that I've got at top dead center on the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.680 
that I've got at top dead center on the
compression<00:02:15.560> stroke<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.280> means<00:02:17.690> that

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
compression stroke so that means that

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.660 
compression stroke so that means that
the<00:02:18.840> loads<00:02:19.080> are<00:02:19.290> kind<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.590> facing<00:02:20.190> downwards

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
the loads are kind of facing downwards

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.400 
the loads are kind of facing downwards
or<00:02:20.850> they're<00:02:21.240> sitting<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.870> little<00:02:21.930> pool

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
or they're sitting in this little pool

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.790 
or they're sitting in this little pool
of<00:02:22.530> oil<00:02:22.680> and<00:02:23.510> if<00:02:24.510> you<00:02:24.690> never<00:02:24.930> look<00:02:25.110> in<00:02:25.260> here<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
of oil and if you never look in here it

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.100 
of oil and if you never look in here it
looks<00:02:26.100> like<00:02:26.190> a<00:02:26.520> lost<00:02:26.910> top<00:02:27.180> dead<00:02:27.360> center<00:02:27.750> but

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
looks like a lost top dead center but

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.480 
looks like a lost top dead center but
there<00:02:28.290> should<00:02:28.470> be<00:02:28.500> a<00:02:28.620> line<00:02:28.860> on<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.190> I'll

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
there should be a line on there I'll

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.949 
there should be a line on there I'll
show<00:02:29.520> you<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.880> a<00:02:29.940> little<00:02:30.209> bit<00:02:30.450> later<00:02:30.600> when<00:02:30.900> I

rubber gasket garlic stuff you know go

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.050 
rubber gasket garlic stuff you know go
ahead<00:02:58.170> and<00:02:58.380> check<00:02:59.040> the<00:02:59.160> camshaft<00:02:59.610> back<00:02:59.880> in

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
ahead and check the camshaft back in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.310 
ahead and check the camshaft back in
tighten<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.930> on<00:03:01.790> there's<00:03:02.790> like<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.290> like<00:03:04.290> a

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:04.320 
tighten it on there's like a like a

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.640 
tighten it on there's like a like a
bendable<00:03:04.890> washer<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:06.209> stops<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:06.870> camshaft

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
bendable washer that stops the camshaft

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.420 
bendable washer that stops the camshaft
nuts<00:03:08.130> or<00:03:08.459> bolts<00:03:08.700> from<00:03:09.000> tightening<00:03:09.840> themselves

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
nuts or bolts from tightening themselves

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:13.040 
nuts or bolts from tightening themselves
and<00:03:11.430> so<00:03:11.940> yeah<00:03:12.090> that's<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.420> next<00:03:12.540> step<00:03:12.780> I<00:03:12.989> think

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
and so yeah that's the next step I think

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.910 
and so yeah that's the next step I think
I'll<00:03:13.410> um<00:03:14.299> next<00:03:15.299> thing<00:03:15.480> you'll<00:03:15.630> see<00:03:15.840> is<00:03:16.049> a

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:16.920 
I'll um next thing you'll see is a

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.610 
I'll um next thing you'll see is a
camshaft<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.910> there<00:03:18.090> hopefully<00:03:18.810> so<00:03:19.230> happens

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
camshaft in there hopefully so happens

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.039 
camshaft in there hopefully so happens
cool<00:03:20.010> all<00:03:20.850> right<00:03:20.970> that<00:03:21.390> was<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.540> freaking<00:03:21.900> pain

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
camshaft to the drive wheel so just off

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:38.479 
camshaft to the drive wheel so just off
the<00:03:34.410> cam<00:03:35.340> chain<00:03:35.370> sprocket<00:03:36.650> as<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.860> can<00:03:38.040> see

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
the cam chain sprocket as you can see

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.330 
the cam chain sprocket as you can see
here<00:03:38.760> there<00:03:39.420> goes<00:03:39.780> the<00:03:39.989> camera<00:03:40.190> there<00:03:41.190> pretty

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
here there goes the camera there pretty

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.800 
here there goes the camera there pretty
much<00:03:41.430> what's<00:03:41.820> going<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.120> happen<00:03:42.360> is<00:03:42.480> there's<00:03:42.720> a
