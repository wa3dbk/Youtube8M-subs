00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.020
 hello again again youtube friend 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:09.319
 I'm going to teach a new chicken coop that I've 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.319
 constructed 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.490
 also the hen of race 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:26.220

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 I have southern blue 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.220
 Franciscan 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.480
 and pita paints 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.950
 with its corresponding nests 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.309
 they say united with the race a race of 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.309
 chlorine 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:49.040
 apart I have free chickens that are 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.090
 the ones that I have here puts good very 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.440
 good the Catalan 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.640
 I have also gayoso southern 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.840
 Spanish 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:05.440
 Here I have the Andalucian Andalusian hen 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:09.250
 black that are very good also in this 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.659
 another chicken coop as you will see that you are 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:12.659
 divided between one and another 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.659
 he also has his body not even understood 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.520
 I have 2 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:25.020
 same as that list before one of 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.020
 carafe and after a drawer 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 rise of January 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.390
 as January 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.490
 practically all ecological 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.990
 and we are happy what happens but 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.210
 it has a rainy day not to 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.780
 It's raining during the rainy days 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.340
 here in Seville that those who do not see 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.160
 of course I've put these two ago 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.350
 chicken coop in these last three days there 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.970
 the problem can rain for your 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.390
 place 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:02.700
 where I ended up why is it 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.490
 the hen are practically 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.990
 used to always loose and clear 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:09.140
 Now comes the rainy day that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.610
 possibly the whole week of rain 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.020
 then possibly get sick or if 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.550
 they are low although I have the other 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.980
 Large birds can roost dabble 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:22.940
 but the night is coming up all in 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.260
 the trees and of course if it tires him barrÃ³n 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.260
 like he stays with him with the downpour 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:35.909
 well I kept teaching everything 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.459
 and every time I have less good space 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.000
 I have more space but what is the 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.540
 fence that I have closed practically what 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.590
 I have already 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:51.560
 quite busy 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.560
 I also put plastic under 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.879
 and then I put rods of these 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.319
 curtain of cane above more than anything 

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.319
 when you do that so you give him shadows 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:09.790
 there I have to be dad all as they are 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:09.790
 outdoors and they are drying up now 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:17.220
 there in the Catalan for they are very good 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.819
 here the big chicken coop where I have 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.819
 it's loose 

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:28.000
 I have six nests too 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.410
 I have a small and sickly 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.410
 once he recovers 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.490
 throwing a little medication a little 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.490
 of food and water 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.220
 As you will see, a chicken coop is 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:46.030
 the others also had cloth 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:46.030
 metal on this side 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.430
 I have already big and I am already 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:55.590
 putting up 

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:57.660
 they are laying eggs 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.959
 hoping that with a size the eggs 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:04.470
 in conditions they just put we will 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:07.349
 something small as the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:10.260
 eggs is growing growing here 

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:13.130
 a week two weeks already then you have 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:15.900
 good proportions 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.870
 to get more than anything 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.549
 breed chick that I'm taking out but 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.270
 that does not get dame from this one that I have there 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:25.750
 white 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:30.240
 and we have the gallo castellano 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.240
 southern a very good callo stallion 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:37.249
 here we have vintages too 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:40.099
 dressed whales 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:43.289
 there is another Catalan for on this side 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.259
 of money I have few and in aroma 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:48.649
 this one that I have it conditioned that 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:48.649
 I have done 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.639
 obviously the 'armada' 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:57.719
 and here is what I have prepared for 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:57.719
 when it's like a chick 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:06.930
 and I also have mackerel 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.050
 chicks this will have 12 handles per 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.050
 there 

00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.720
 the closed that is that they are capable of 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:19.050
 get out 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.740
 why 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.740
 the chicken 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.780
 practically of all the pens all 

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:33.210
 the colors also and more here below 

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:36.139
 there will be about 20 out there 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.139
 previously 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:40.849
 another 24 eggs the incubator 

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:45.740
 up chick beds 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.520
 on this side we are on the other side of 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:52.370
 the chicken coop that also everything with mesh 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.230
 then you see on all sides here 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:56.230
 I have also built three more nests 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.990
 and two eggs are just put to himself 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:07.340
 and has traveled this morning 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:07.340
 pretty egg go 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:17.280
 they are all very happy with their new 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:19.689
 henhouse his perch his companions his 

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.990
 drinker 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:24.910
 and well clean 

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:27.520
 with its corresponding the nest 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:29.290
 at least already when it rains and that 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.490
 they are silly many times they get into the 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.280
 big chicken coop I have the door 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.740
 open but other times not other times 

00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:38.230
 they go up long and you can give him water 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:40.510
 that the fall does not go down 

00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:42.790
 So now that the winter comes 

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:45.240
 that I had it more collected than not 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:47.910
 protect it from the rain 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.170
 so they do not get sick 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:51.170
 we understand quillo 

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:56.520
 good friends, this is all that 

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:59.770
 I wanted to teach I told you that when 

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.879
 Had the chicken coops done 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:02.879
 I would only teach 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.180
 here I have all my luck 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:11.980
 these are two ecological feeders that 

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.980
 I also do organic food 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:20.060
 and then I have also hung 

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:20.060
 their corresponding feeders also 

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.440
 on the other side of the henhouse 

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:37.950
 the truth that I have happy all new 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.950
 there in the fact 

00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:41.990
 already at least they are already more collected 

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:46.060
 the hen 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:48.160
 and apart I have them separated by their race 

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:50.950
 to take out the eggs and do not have to 

00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:53.310
 be mixing a trace of a race and 

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:53.310
 of other 

00:07:56.030 --> 00:08:02.740
 good friends, this is all 

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:05.310
 call ahead there is another video and there would be 

00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.310
 counting 

00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:08.440
 I dressed
