I also put it on my chin and it kind of
blots<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.129> face<00:00:56.399> instead<00:00:56.879> of<00:00:57.030> you<00:00:57.120> having<00:00:57.360> to

sheets<00:01:18.450> that<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.200> put<00:01:19.439> on<00:01:19.560> top<00:01:19.830> of<00:01:19.860> the<00:01:20.759> toilet

sheets that you put on top of the toilet

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.999 
sheets that you put on top of the toilet
paper<00:01:21.150> in<00:01:21.450> public<00:01:21.810> restrooms<00:01:22.259> I've<00:01:22.710> heard

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
paper in public restrooms I've heard

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.530 
paper in public restrooms I've heard
that<00:01:23.159> if<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.430> get<00:01:23.640> one<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.119> cut<00:01:24.299> it<00:01:24.330> up

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
that if you get one and you cut it up

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.330 
that if you get one and you cut it up
into<00:01:24.689> little<00:01:24.810> pieces<00:01:25.020> and<00:01:25.350> you<00:01:25.560> do<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.159> to

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
into little pieces and you do that to

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.999 
into little pieces and you do that to
your<00:01:26.430> face<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:27.000> absorbs<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> oils<00:01:28.409> too<00:01:28.710> so

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
your face it absorbs the oils too so

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.620 
your face it absorbs the oils too so
that's<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.610> little<00:01:29.790> tip<00:01:30.060> even<00:01:30.390> though

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
that's just a little tip even though

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.840 
that's just a little tip even though
it's<00:01:30.869> not<00:01:31.049> something<00:01:31.430> drugstore<00:01:32.430> if<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.670> have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
it's not something drugstore if you have

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.640 
it's not something drugstore if you have

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.510 
salicylic at another skincare product
that<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.069> reckon

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that I reckon

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.400 
that I reckon
then<00:02:11.610> would<00:02:11.760> be<00:02:11.880> those<00:02:12.060> B<00:02:12.300> or<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.510> no<00:02:12.840> strips<00:02:13.230> and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
then would be those B or a no strips and

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.590 
then would be those B or a no strips and
it<00:02:13.530> also<00:02:13.680> comes<00:02:13.980> with<00:02:14.100> face<00:02:14.400> strips<00:02:14.730> I<00:02:14.940> ran<00:02:15.420> out

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
it also comes with face strips I ran out

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.330 
it also comes with face strips I ran out
of<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.870> nose<00:02:16.080> strips<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.710> I<00:02:16.830> used<00:02:17.040> it<00:02:17.220> all

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
of the nose strips because I used it all

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.010 
of the nose strips because I used it all
but<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.670> face<00:02:17.880> strips<00:02:18.150> are<00:02:18.360> pretty<00:02:18.660> much<00:02:18.840> the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
but the face strips are pretty much the

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.770 
but the face strips are pretty much the
same<00:02:19.260> thing<00:02:19.650> you<00:02:20.310> wet<00:02:20.610> your<00:02:20.790> skin<00:02:21.240> make<00:02:21.600> sure

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
it becomes completely hardened and then

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.850

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
post but this is a good drugstore

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.060 
post but this is a good drugstore
alternative<00:02:54.630> but<00:02:54.810> it's<00:02:54.960> not<00:02:55.140> as<00:02:55.320> good<00:02:55.590> i<00:02:55.800> I

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:58.340 
alternative but it's not as good i I
would<00:02:56.610> say<00:02:56.850> but<00:02:57.210> overall<00:02:57.750> I<00:02:57.900> thought<00:02:58.200> I'd

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
would say but overall I thought I'd

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.110 
would say but overall I thought I'd
still<00:02:58.620> recommend<00:02:58.800> it<00:02:59.220> because<00:02:59.400> it<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.790> a<00:02:59.820> good

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
still recommend it because it is a good

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.400 
still recommend it because it is a good
drugstore<00:03:00.540> price<00:03:00.780> and<00:03:01.050> it's<00:03:01.200> easily

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.630 
accessible or an outdoor facial
moisturizer<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.130> the<00:03:05.310> set<00:03:05.520> of

maybe if you have eczema

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.580 
maybe if you have eczema
I<00:04:44.790> recommend<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:45.660> because<00:04:45.780> oatmeal<00:04:46.230> is<00:04:46.410> so

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
I recommend it because oatmeal is so

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.620 
I recommend it because oatmeal is so
beneficial<00:04:46.800> for<00:04:47.310> your<00:04:47.430> skin<00:04:47.760> if<00:04:48.000> you<00:04:48.150> have<00:04:48.360> any

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
those with that skin type and as far as

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.370 
those with that skin type and as far as
a<00:04:56.250> facial<00:04:56.610> scrub<00:04:57.000> I<00:04:57.240> actually<00:04:57.450> use<00:04:57.840> that<00:04:57.870> more

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
a facial scrub I actually use that more

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:01.130
