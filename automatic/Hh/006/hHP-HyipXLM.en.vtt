00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.080
Today is mother's day, how great! Right?

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.480
Mother's Day a wonderful date!

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.980
What remembers us all, how important this day is

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.420
because it remembers us,

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:11.040
that our mother,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.260
this precious human

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.980
many years ago

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:16.540
had Sexual intercourse

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.860
Yes!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.360
Of course, even your mother one day was a young cluelessly woman

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.400
Before your dad made her a Mom

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.980
And every you ask yourself

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.640
Man, what will I give my mom to her day?

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.760
back then it was easier, you just tinkered something, did it yourself,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.840
Something crochet for your mother

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.500
something picked,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.400
something stolen,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.180
Things, mother usually like

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.040
or if you didn't't had any time

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.480
you scribbled on a post-it "be nice one day"

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.180
" Aww, that was, what I wished myself!"

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:53.760
But today mothers are different,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.960
they aren't even real mothers

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.940
today they are more like best friends.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.400
Mothers and daughters are BFF's today

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.980
-best friends forever-

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.180
you don't even call your mother "mother", I noticed

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.500
No you say "mom" or "ma"

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.260
It's no longer my mother, i's my mom!

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.260
"Oh my God this is my mom,

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.860
I've got an E (5) in English, but this is my mom

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:21.960
Yeah, than we went to the After-hour"

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.360
Man After-hour, my mother thinks After-hour is a cheap mint chocolate from ALDI

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.540
I mean After-hour

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:39.940
For an After-hour you get slapped by your mother

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.380
What is this for a sick shit?

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.480
You can't go with your own mother to the club!

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.920
You shout at each other

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.580
why you don't wear underwear

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.960
My mother

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.640
she was allowed to DRIVE me to the club

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.500
But never to come with me in it!

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.600
She had to let me get outthe car five streets before

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.600
lights out so nobody could see us together

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.380
but today it's like that

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.280
you go with your mother partying

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.840
the same music

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.640
you always hear together

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.480
do you have a song with your mother

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.680
"Ey mom this is our song!"

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.160
What will it be 'HÃ¤nschen klein'? Or what?

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.160

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.160
'we butter the bread with butter'?

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Will you going the club with your mother and will take it down on '50 Cent', in the club

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.680
And your mother sings like

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:27.960
"I let you lick the lollipop,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.620
go 'head girl, don't you stop

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.680
think about it!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.540
You are with your mother like

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.480
You are with your mother like a party pussy

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.660
and the guys

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.440
imagine, the guys just talk to you, to get you mother!

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:45.480
Man, lower you can't fall, then being the f*cking wingman for your own mother!

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:54.140
Hey cutie, you're looking good and so, but little question, where is your mom?

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.580
What will I know?!

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.620
What will I know where she is!

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.620
ironing? or some shit?

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:00.280
what Mothers do!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.280
Or even worse nightmare, a guy thinks he recognizes you and says

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.360
Hey we made out last weekend, why you didn't wrote back?

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.860
Oh my gosh!

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.540
You confound me with my mother!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:14.660
No!

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.840
What should my mother

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.100
What should my mother do in the club?

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.780
to be matched by tinder?

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:21.760
twerk?

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.260
hook up with guys? or what?

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.100
okay, if I imagine

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.680
I will really imagine, that I will go with my real mother to the club

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.420
I think the first she would do

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800
would be, she would ventilate.

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:37.720
"What is this here? Oh no!

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.440
This is no good air in here!"

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.280
First of all a great air draft!

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.620
Then wipe everything of

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.120
standing tables

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:46.140
counter

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.340
Yeah, get everything clear.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.420
empty the ashtray

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.720
Toilet-woman can go home

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.060
then she would go outside, and give all the girls a jacket.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:55.540
"Na don't you wear a undershirt?! Get this on!"

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:00.000
For the boys she has those Tupfer cans with apple splits, "Here is without peel

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.340
With peel or without peel, I have everything here!"

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.900
And IF my mother dances, IF she dances

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:08.080
then only, because it should be!

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.680
because by my mother dancing looks like working

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.820
If my mother dances it's like this

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:18.920
"This must be done now. Come this should be now .. Come this should be also danced away. This should be done now. Let's go!"

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:19.800
And then five minutes break

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.300
dank coffe

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:22.580
take all glass

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.580
clear them
