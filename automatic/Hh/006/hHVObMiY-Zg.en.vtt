00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 hello today you talk about 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.950
 skirts of cum and I have a hope 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.930
 on plants that are captured by the 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 fact that gold is meant are held are only 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.040
 not have them as other species 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.530
 of plants the shock so carried by 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.000
 the icon that serve them as protection 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.830
 and we never ran an experiment 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.029
 conifers 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.850
 they are trees that have been planted 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.230
 and also the biggest pebbles they have 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.300
 took off the container 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.859
 after having leaves on the branch 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.439
 the majority of the gymnasts are resold 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:30.420
 these sentences have thorns on it 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790
 exists against exceptions as per 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.469
 specific example that there are no planes 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.600
 800 mhz nose the sperm gym species 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.550
 but we have already existed up to 20000 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.149
 several species have disappeared because 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.149
 is guilty 1 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.890
 the seeds produced by the newspapers 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.960
 sperm are protected by some kind of 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:01:00.830
 Corsican that allows them to protect themselves 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:01:10.580
 against the weather shocks 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:12.259
 when already falling over their school 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.420
 this helps to protect against 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.210
 predators like eating birds 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.580
 their seeds which is located inside 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.180
 but how do the junos farms make for 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.000
 to reproduce 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.580
 in fact when spring comes the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.009
 lot of cons are now better what 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.590
 allows them to release millions of 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.060
 small grains of pollen if small grain 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.890
 of pollen result in a 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.560
 yellow dust what will create 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.500
 literally a cloud that will settle 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.720
 everywhere around conifers 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.399
 every little one and the pollen has some 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.470
 small balloons plaindra 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.740
 which increases its gripping surface to 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.679
 wind it promotes its dispersion almost 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.000
 100% of the reproduction of gymnosperms 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.789
 is carried out so as to ticketing 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.619
 ie by the wine let's go see jean 

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.330
 marc to better understand how the 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.899
 production is done inside 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.899
 the body 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.050
 found on the ground is when you see 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.970
 scales everybody had that one 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:28.820
 only interior of its details has 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:40.250
 some as others to see 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:42.650
 see you later god and so here 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.120
 that's what she's saying up to 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.420
 inside one of these scales the 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.519
 buddy example right here or is that 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.769
 where is sperm union 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:55.610
 between yale in the tail of pie have so 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:10.519
 well known fertility hockey leggings 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:12.950
 has said that falling to the ground is the 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.870
 young ben ali less known because and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.280
 we do not see them reach me the league is 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.989
 at the end of the branches that are also 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.150
 placed generally higher than it is 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:24.620
 than the females that I was waiting for that 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:30.519
 transporting pollen so 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:30.519
 now I'm going naked and that's it 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.150
 more and more commissions can 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.840
 see that there are many I find 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.150
 that there are spermatozoa that those 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.250
 glimpses in production period they 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:59.799
 are great they came to not by 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:59.799
 the vampire and then he lives 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.700
 this is a path worth 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:10.010
 explain in a simpler way 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:12.320
 reproduction of human semen logs 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.820
 that you can see here in bigger at 

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:15.950
 inside each of the branches 

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:18.510
 best sperm that go to you 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.430
 will not be released from the bottom 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.070
 so you see that's so ivory either 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:27.030
 there some fumellous happen between 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.660
 two scales and then spent the 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:29.520
 two hurdles kayes 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.120
 he wants to pass and be able to enter the 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:36.360
 little opening right here next to 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.300
 to pass from the nephew fire through the 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.490
 liturgy and then the sperm goes 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.920
 start building a power tunnel 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.410
 get through the protection again from 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:48.410
 the housing bubble a fertilization 

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:54.810
 after his pacifier and so do not 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:56.780
 fall back to the ground and the eagles have 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.070
 started to grow 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.300
 after the scales you started to 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.310
 fall one by one then we do not 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.690
 your husband in the surrey started to 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.690
 push for a new hue
