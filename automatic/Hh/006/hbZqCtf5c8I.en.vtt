up the possibilities and the sounds on

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.020 
up the possibilities and the sounds on
the<00:03:43.170> keyboard<00:03:43.590> so<00:03:43.950> here's<00:03:44.190> a<00:03:44.250> short<00:03:44.340> excerpt

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
the keyboard so here's a short excerpt

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.840 
the keyboard so here's a short excerpt
from<00:03:45.300> about<00:03:45.570> halfway<00:03:45.870> through<00:03:46.080> this<00:03:46.410> lesson

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
from about halfway through this lesson

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.310 
from about halfway through this lesson
is<00:03:47.850> to<00:03:48.000> use<00:03:48.120> that<00:03:48.300> voice<00:03:48.510> in<00:03:48.720> your<00:03:48.840> left<00:03:49.080> hand

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
is to use that voice in your left hand

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.680 
is to use that voice in your left hand
and<00:03:49.590> in<00:03:50.310> your<00:03:50.340> right<00:03:50.610> hand<00:03:50.640> you<00:03:51.060> play<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.270> triad

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
and in your right hand you play a triad

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.230 
and in your right hand you play a triad
of<00:03:51.900> fifth<00:03:52.380> up<00:03:52.530> from<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.800> root<00:03:53.010> you<00:03:53.910> play<00:03:54.150> it

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:54.240 
of fifth up from the root you play it

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.540 
of fifth up from the root you play it
anywhere<00:03:54.540> you<00:03:54.660> want<00:03:54.870> and<00:03:55.320> go<00:03:55.890> to<00:03:55.950> a<00:03:56.130> triad

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
anywhere you want and go to a triad

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:59.030 
anywhere you want and go to a triad
built<00:03:56.730> a<00:03:56.940> second<00:03:57.540> up<00:03:57.720> from<00:03:57.900> the<00:03:58.050> root<00:03:58.200> in<00:03:58.590> this

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
built a second up from the root in this

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.900 
built a second up from the root in this
case<00:03:59.250> it's<00:03:59.490> a<00:03:59.580> D<00:03:59.730> tread<00:04:01.430> look<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:02.550> that<00:04:02.670> and

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
case it's a D tread look at that and

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.240 
case it's a D tread look at that and
then<00:04:03.120> nice<00:04:03.360> now<00:04:04.050> those<00:04:04.260> notes<00:04:04.590> technically

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
then nice now those notes technically

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.460 
then nice now those notes technically
are<00:04:05.400> not<00:04:05.640> within<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.210> chord<00:04:06.510> but<00:04:07.200> they're

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
are not within the chord but they're

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.320 
are not within the chord but they're
passing<00:04:07.890> tones<00:04:08.130> because<00:04:08.400> we<00:04:08.670> use<00:04:08.940> them<00:04:09.180> as

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
passing tones because we use them as

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.640 
passing tones because we use them as
such<00:04:09.630> listen<00:04:10.260> to<00:04:10.320> this

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:12.650 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.620 

so<00:04:13.650> there's<00:04:13.800> the<00:04:13.980> D<00:04:14.130> tryna<00:04:14.400> moves<00:04:14.700> back<00:04:14.970> to<00:04:15.599> the

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
so there's the D tryna moves back to the

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.210 
so there's the D tryna moves back to the
major<00:04:15.930> nine

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
major nine

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.310 
major nine
guess<00:04:18.850> what<00:04:19.090> you<00:04:19.209> can<00:04:19.360> straddle<00:04:19.720> the<00:04:19.989> D<00:04:20.170> as

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:20.320 
guess what you can straddle the D as

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.700 
guess what you can straddle the D as
well

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.820
