00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.580
 welcome your last time me 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.560
 steel regularly ask about 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.330
 dvuhsimochny device and one and understandable 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.010
 street years and barely a mobile phone with you 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.900
 not everyone wants to carry 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.660
 Naturally apparatus such diverse 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.520
 there is more expensive there is cheaper today 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.910
 I'll tell you about pretty budget 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:24.539
 highscreen a solution of 2 cores 2 Sims 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.910
 screen 800 by 480 and it's all less than 4 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 thousand rubles let's see in 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.230
 In addition to the papers, you will find a total of 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:34.130
 only three things charger and AC 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.870
 a successful one gives a half ampere at the output 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:39.480
 micro usb cable is nothing here 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.270
 original and headset lugs to 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.430
 the ears here are vacuum she fingers only 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.469
 microphone hole and receive button 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.780
 clear out unfortunately volume controls 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.430
 and rewind tracks are not here but 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.260
 it would be strange to see them for such and such 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 price and so let's look at 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.829
 I will remind the device in more detail inside 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.739
 there is a qualcomm dual core processor 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:00.840
 snapdragon s4 it is one gigahertz 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.290
 core one and a half thousand milliampere hours 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.479
 Battery 512 RAM 4 gigs 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.090
 There is also a built-in micro and you know how 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:12.090
 Nekras here is 800 by 480 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.220
 means the front of the device represents 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.619
 a pretty normal 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.540
 the body is nothing original on top 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.520
 speaker array near sensors 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.520
 approaching light front camera 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.280
 below left three touch buttons this 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 menu home and return back here this one 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.600
 little dot 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.600
 this is the microphone further let's see what 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.110
 do we have on the butt means on one 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.729
 on-off button 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.079
 blocking 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:45.060
 bottom hole charger under micro usb 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:47.460
 on the other end is a regular key 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.240
 volume control double and top 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.240
 headphone and headset jack 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:56.399
 peephole camera peephole flash and grating 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.110
 which is calling for 

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.409
 speaker that's all 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.329
 We have a soft-touch plastic in the back 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.399
 Generally, some prints remain. 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.530
 fingers but naturally no 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.929
 microscratches you will not notice here 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.120
 let's talk about the screen now 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.950
 it means no tap here of course as in 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.709
 any budget solution is not very 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.190
 bright well and in the viewing angles I now you 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.709
 all show you see everything yourself that is 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.110
 there is a complete color inversion and care 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:27.420
 colors vertically by the way if we 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.370
 look below the corners are much bigger 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.610
 turn up but horizontally too in 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.319
 in general, everything is clear on the one hand 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:36.420
 screen in the sun behaves pretty 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.849
 decent but still small 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.860
 relative brightness plus very much 

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.930
 a large number of highlights leads to its 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.000
 almost complete non-readability for 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.920
 normal operation with the screen you have to 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.120
 turn aside to leave 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.060
 instead of darker 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:53.459
 or close the screen palm interface 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.200
 here is almost naked android that in 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:57.180
 Generally good lags 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.980
 if something is present 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.319
 problems especially and do not deliver 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.930
 rewind apps and widgets too 

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:06.900
 pretty smooth and so in this 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.450
 now everything is fine let's go now 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:13.409
 let's go through synthetics here in the square 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:16.610
 Our device scored 2860 one point in 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.379
 antutu showed us 6100 three points 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:22.590
 nenamark2 pleased with twenty seven and 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:26.430
 60 frames per second and indicated what's inside 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:28.230
 worth adreno 200 3 you llama constantly at 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.420
 start up cursed for failure 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.549
 memory but still showed us three hundred 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.540
 Here is eighty-three points here 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.970
 interesting number 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.370
 I wanted to show you a thing called 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.560
 epic citadel but unfortunately she 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.560
 starts and shows a black screen with 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.930
 the sound turned out to run in essence 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.400
 very few programs by the way when 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.450
 you download these same programs 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.610
 requiring cache 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.439
 be sure to put a memory card 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.159
 otherwise you will receive permanent departures 

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:58.349
 from the market in the rest but the toy is on 

00:03:56.159 --> 00:04:01.090
 In principle , this is pretty smooth but 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.890
 there is twitching there are some problems 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.019
 small of course this device is not 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.870
 is playable but on the other hand what 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.459
 you wanted for that kind of camera money 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.129
 here though but 5 megapixels 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.319
 Autofocus out unfortunately not therefore 

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:16.000
 the pictures are such that well in 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:18.900
 overall you yourself can see everything 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.900
 now on screen 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.030
 Well, according to the tradition I will say a few words about 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.280
 battery until the evening we live out 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.820
 Butt practically and this with a small 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:37.320
 load 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:39.320
 if we start playing toys then 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.470
 get ready and children near the outlet 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.720
 findings 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.820
 the device is naturally one radio module 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.910
 so one simka at a time 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:49.770
 otherwise active principle is not 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.560
 the worst characteristics for money 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.420
 less and 4,000 rubles I think to him 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.440
 It is worth looking at the more design 

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:58.560
 quite decent 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:01.290
 Well, the assembly is also good main minus 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.300
 as I said it is a battery therefore 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:05.580
 if you are interested in exactly cheap 

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.160
 dvuhsimochnye solution then look he 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.650
 will compete with the likes and the rest 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:12.420
 all for today all saying goodbye to you but 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.070
 very briefly for new ones to come soon 

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.070
 reviews bye bye
