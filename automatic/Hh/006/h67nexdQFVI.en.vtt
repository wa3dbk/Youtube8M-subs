best<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> a<00:00:31.410> well<00:00:31.769> fitting<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.399> it

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
best so there is a well fitting so it

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.090 
best so there is a well fitting so it
really<00:00:33.450> should<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:34.290> know<00:00:34.440> it's<00:00:34.559> not<00:00:34.680> to<00:00:34.860> lose

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
it's not too tight mm but must be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860
