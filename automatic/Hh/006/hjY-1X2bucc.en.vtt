00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
YouTube class but I don't think I get

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
so you'll have to worry about that I

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.290 
so you'll have to worry about that I
wasn't<00:02:41.800> using<00:02:41.980> card<00:02:42.310> line<00:02:42.490> or<00:02:42.670> sodden<00:02:43.000> power<00:02:43.150> i

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
wasn't using card line or sodden power i

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.600 
wasn't using card line or sodden power i
was<00:02:43.540> using<00:02:43.660> not<00:02:43.930> danger<00:02:44.500> close<00:02:44.680> so<00:02:45.490> i<00:02:45.550> think

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
was using not danger close so i think

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.580 
was using not danger close so i think
with<00:02:45.850> a<00:02:45.880> lot<00:02:46.090> of<00:02:46.150> guns<00:02:46.450> if<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:46.990> don't<00:02:47.230> you're

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
with a lot of guns if you don't you're

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.860 
with a lot of guns if you don't you're
really<00:02:48.100> overpowered<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:48.670> skiing<00:02:48.940> but<00:02:49.180> if<00:02:49.690> you

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
really overpowered and skiing but if you

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.240 
really overpowered and skiing but if you
join<00:02:50.080> us<00:02:50.140> time<00:02:50.380> power<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.770> kind<00:02:50.980> of<00:02:51.040> balances

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
join us time power it kind of balances

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.240 
join us time power it kind of balances
