00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
those pipes that you fill up with water

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.190 
those pipes that you fill up with water
but<00:01:40.200> more<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:40.770> think<00:01:41.040> about<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.630> the<00:01:42.630> gadget

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
but more I think about it the gadget

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.160 
but more I think about it the gadget
page<00:01:43.380> didn't<00:01:43.829> include<00:01:44.100> water<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.990> let's<00:01:45.990> take

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
page didn't include water so let's take

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.899 
page didn't include water so let's take
the<00:01:46.320> top<00:01:46.500> off<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:48.320> all<00:01:49.320> right<00:01:49.590> there<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.070> no

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the top off and all right there it is no

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.510 
the top off and all right there it is no
water<00:01:51.149> needed<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:52.200> I'm<00:01:52.829> gonna<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.399> my

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
water needed so I'm gonna have to get my

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.100 
water needed so I'm gonna have to get my
flashlight<00:01:53.790> so<00:01:54.180> I<00:01:54.240> can<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.540> down<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.960> here

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
flashlight so I can look down in here

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.990 
flashlight so I can look down in here
and<00:01:55.200> see<00:01:55.350> what<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.710> okay<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.430> can't<00:01:56.729> show<00:01:56.939> you

and see what I got okay I can't show you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.819 
and see what I got okay I can't show you
this<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.479> use<00:01:57.689> my<00:01:57.840> flashlight<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:58.649> look

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
this but I use my flashlight and I look

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.190 
this but I use my flashlight and I look
down<00:01:58.860> in<00:01:59.219> there<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.689> it<00:02:00.689> looked<00:02:00.840> like<00:02:00.930> it<00:02:01.140> had

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
down in there and it looked like it had

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.190 
down in there and it looked like it had
a<00:02:01.290> hook<00:02:01.530> on<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.509> cash<00:02:03.689> owner<00:02:03.930> so<00:02:04.170> I

a hook on it but I'm the cash owner so I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.630 
a hook on it but I'm the cash owner so I
know<00:02:04.320> there's<00:02:04.649> there's<00:02:04.860> two<00:02:05.009> ways<00:02:05.189> to<00:02:05.219> skin<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640

magnet tool down there instead of my

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.760 
magnet tool down there instead of my
tool<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:11.090> I<00:02:12.090> felt<00:02:12.540> something<00:02:12.780> click

I love these these really keep a cache
dry<00:02:28.010> on<00:02:29.010> another<00:02:29.370> video<00:02:29.670> I'm<00:02:29.790> will<00:02:30.000> actually

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
dry on another video I'm will actually

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.470 
dry on another video I'm will actually
show<00:02:30.570> you<00:02:30.630> I<00:02:30.720> have<00:02:30.930> one<00:02:30.990> of<00:02:31.230> these<00:02:31.320> underwater

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
show you I have one of these underwater

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.630 
show you I have one of these underwater
but<00:02:33.480> I've<00:02:33.690> actually<00:02:33.990> got<00:02:34.380> magnets<00:02:35.070> on<00:02:35.280> both

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
but I've actually got magnets on both

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.790 
but I've actually got magnets on both
ends<00:02:36.060> there's<00:02:36.480> a<00:02:36.540> magnet<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.080> this<00:02:37.290> end<00:02:37.590> as

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800 
ends there's a magnet on this end as

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.180 
ends there's a magnet on this end as
well<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.390> top<00:02:39.630> you'll<00:02:40.620> see<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:41.010> there's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
well as the top you'll see that there's

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.220 
well as the top you'll see that there's
a<00:02:41.250> magnet<00:02:41.640> there<00:02:41.880> that<00:02:42.390> way<00:02:42.600> whether<00:02:42.930> the

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
a magnet there that way whether the

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.580 
a magnet there that way whether the
catcher<00:02:43.440> drops<00:02:43.800> it<00:02:43.980> in<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.280> way<00:02:44.490> or<00:02:44.790> this<00:02:44.850> way

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
catcher drops it in this way or this way

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.720 
catcher drops it in this way or this way
they<00:02:46.590> can<00:02:46.770> always<00:02:46.950> retrieve<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.580> with<00:02:47.700> a

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
they can always retrieve it with a

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.970 
they can always retrieve it with a
magnet<00:02:48.210> but<00:02:48.630> this<00:02:48.870> is<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.170> way<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.350> prefer<00:02:49.650> to

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
magnet but this is the way I prefer to

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:50.960 
magnet but this is the way I prefer to
drop<00:02:50.250> it

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
drop it

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.360 
drop it
this<00:02:51.360> way<00:02:51.600> when<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.290> reach<00:02:52.770> down<00:02:53.040> they<00:02:53.250> can

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.370 
this way when they reach down they can

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:55.940 
this way when they reach down they can
either<00:02:53.550> use<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.820> magnet<00:02:54.360> or<00:02:54.720> if<00:02:55.380> they<00:02:55.620> look<00:02:55.800> at

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
either use a magnet or if they look at

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.370 
either use a magnet or if they look at
your<00:02:56.070> list<00:02:56.370> there's<00:02:57.090> not<00:02:57.240> only<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.600> magnet<00:02:58.140> on

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
your list there's not only a magnet on

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.910 
your list there's not only a magnet on
the<00:02:59.130> list<00:02:59.370> but<00:02:59.910> there's<00:03:00.120> also<00:03:00.330> a<00:03:00.840> string<00:03:01.410> and<00:03:01.770> a

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
the list but there's also a string and a

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.850 
the list but there's also a string and a
paperclip<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.730> can<00:03:03.330> unfold<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.470> paperclip

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860

paperclip you can unfold a paperclip
hook<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.460> a<00:03:05.490> string<00:03:05.820> and<00:03:06.120> you<00:03:06.600> can<00:03:06.780> actually

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:06.960 
hook it to a string and you can actually

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.050 
hook it to a string and you can actually
reach<00:03:07.350> in<00:03:07.380> and<00:03:07.710> pull<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.070> up<00:03:08.130> so<00:03:08.790> you've<00:03:08.940> got
