00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.830
 can be simple unscrewing 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.299
 aluminum cover lacks style and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.700
 refinement and from q park bottles 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.559
 good wine but with these caps 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.509
 easiest to seal 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:22.529
 bottle or jar and besides they 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:24.119
 suitable for processing hundreds 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.029
 everyday items are closed 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.760
 this plant covers every year 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.650
 250 million metal caps 12 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.149
 sizing caps for bottles 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.149
 made from aluminum sheets 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.790
 size 1 square meter and weighing 450 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.680
 grams about three and a half thin 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:45.059
 aluminum sheets are therefore 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.829
 conveyor first le stelle for me 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.129
 cover with a special compound mixture 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.750
 varnish and ink for 12 minutes they 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.160
 dry 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.910
 painted sheets unloaded onto a conveyor 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.910
 to dry 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.469
 then make a paint pattern applied with 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:05.469
 using this varnishes 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.170
 I have le stelle through once 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.170
 blocker 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.100
 you pattern is printed 

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.290
 there is paint used at the top 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:34.520
 it is bright ink that fit well 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:36.260
 on metal when drying understand sheet and 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.660
 sends them to the transporter stamp 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.340
 oval press 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.530
 this press is available for the covers 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:48.050
 the outlines but the caps will stamp and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.230
 consistently using forms such as 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.230
 this 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:57.130
 first press cut covers can 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.450
 make about 500 lids a minute 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.950
 blades that the cradle press and made 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.140
 carbide very strong metal 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.650
 which can cut tens of millions 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.690
 caps at the exit from the stamp free 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.830
 press caps already have the desired shape 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.830
 but not sizes 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.470
 on the press for forming stretch 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.810
 run the last two cold 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:24.400
 stages first the tube is made necessary 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.810
 length then second stretching tube 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.450
 gets the right diameter 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.640
 with the press and the covers come out already needed 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:34.440
 dimensions to this point cover 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.440
 acquires necessary shape 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.319
 Now you need to decorate the covers according to 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.430
 customer requirements 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.709
 side imprint applied with 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.569
 decorator with mesh stencil which 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.569
 paint about 100 caps per minute 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.550
 decorator using ink created 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.550
 specifically for metal painting 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.200
 then the lids are dried in an oven with heated 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:12.200
 by air 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:19.970
 dried caps are thrown out of the oven and 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.970
 fall into a container 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.260
 this decorator paints a hundred 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.260
 fifty five covers a minute 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:33.840
 ink roller dyeing edges 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.840
 the cap rotates evenly 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:45.360
 it only remains to process 

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.360
 top of the cover and make cuts 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.860
 contouring machine makes 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:53.700
 cuts and relief patterns for 2 hundreds 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.700
 lids minute 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.970
 processing 1 cover takes a fraction of a second 

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.780
 sometimes it is necessary to provide 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.490
 vessel tightness eg bottle 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.630
 wine for this inside is fixed 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.489
 polypropylene lining which 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:18.489
 hermetically clogging the vessel q 

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:25.130
 is checked for the correct light 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:29.960
 whether the cuts are made then form 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:32.660
 another ledge finally the last stage 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.690
 this unit is hermetically sealed 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.690
 a bottle 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.150
 250 are made here every year 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:46.260
 million caps for bottles and 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:46.260
 processed thousands of tons of aluminum
