 I'm just explaining that things 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.290

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.290

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:49.090

 ef 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.850
 going down there will have to go through 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:03:01.540
 eight games thick for l rs bgm esse 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:05.680
 bgm folder is where it has the ccf background sound 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:10.810
 This one is a login or one's own 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:14.049
 lobby of the two actually this is here 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.730
 inventory and this one is from the room and 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:17.739
 here from the black market or the shop 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.010
 probably one of two or two 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:24.819
 even then you can change those 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:27.970
 So let's put it, I want it. 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:30.459
 music that I took from Aris is me 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.590
 I come here in the pass that I have 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.950
 music I'm going to right click 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:39.519
 in music rename as you can see 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.889
 here is a bg imea online trek online lupi 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.530
 and I want to put the lobby on this song 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:47.350
 so I'm going to put bgm underline trek 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.680
 and the underline lupi 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.750
 there beauty with the same name from the 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.670
 Moment the race passes here. 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.340
 ask if you want to replace furniture 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:59.680
 replace everything says so I want to see 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.450
 replace and you 're about to go 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.120
 r will have as much as the music you have chosen 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.340
 changed so you need to change the file 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.090
 to the file name to be able to stay 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.239
 Replace other wants to put 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.959
 store this music so the store is the 3rd or 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:19.840
 2nd year of sure but will put 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:23.860
 vgm design trek 2.1 behind the luan 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:26.729
 danilo pitbull and it's going to be like this 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.380
 It's changing so you can choose 

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:31.690
 This does not only apply to the 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.190
 shop and market and black market 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.960
 rooms 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.050
 but this can possibly come here 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:40.150
 Look at this pass is 2 and you will have all 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.479
 the other sef sounds then for example 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:45.880
 here we see the English folder that the 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:50.020
 messages and a headshot radio from the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:56.099
 This is the kiwis 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:59.130
 blue &amp; green radio messengers 

00:04:56.099 --> 00:05:05.349
 double shock otan 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:08.979
 so for example what is the voice recording 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:18.630
 with head shot goes there picks up the 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:24.840
 recording record him talking here I 

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:28.900
 need a video converter there is 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:32.169
 or the format factory needs to change the 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.930
 video format on youtube that is take away 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.419
 I think it does not have it here but download the 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:39.849
 format factory 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:41.800
 I'll leave the link in the description of the 

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:43.750
 download the film is to factor in baixaki 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:46.000
 I think I did not think it was 

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:54.430
 computer business factor here i go 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:55.770
 try to write here for you to see I think 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.550
 what is this 

00:05:55.770 --> 00:06:03.250
 and that's what it is 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:06.550
 a video converter there you get 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:08.620
 convert and if this recording to mp3 the 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.760
 do the same thing or for example you 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:16.590
 want it when giving a head shot touches 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:22.180
 another low sound eg download 

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:26.320
 fart sound at low mp3 point on 

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:28.860
 google'm pedro race forth old 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:33.700
 for example old topic radiography 

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:36.610
 top left there means it's type and site 

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:38.890
 so for example is that the sound of Peter 

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.750
 whether in sites where changes to the sound 

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:43.930
 Pedro here just always has to remember 

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:46.630
 rename the file you are picking up and 

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:47.590
 drag here to move replace with 

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:50.020
 the same name 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:52.090
 Do not forget to save the sun too. 

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:54.970
 backup backup of your crossfire by 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:58.360
 perhaps all that was to take the 

00:06:54.970 --> 00:07:00.190
 old settings back or 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.650
 simply does not back up after 

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:04.360
 down again cef so that's what I 

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.430
 I wanted to explain some doubt is just 

00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:08.590
