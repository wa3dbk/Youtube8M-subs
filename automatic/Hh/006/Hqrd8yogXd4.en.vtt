Larry's<00:05:52.159> attacking<00:05:52.610> a<00:05:52.699> pretty<00:05:52.909> popular<00:05:53.209> base

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:53.629 
Larry's attacking a pretty popular base

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:55.480 
Larry's attacking a pretty popular base
this<00:05:54.139> is<00:05:54.259> a<00:05:54.289> base<00:05:54.529> at<00:05:54.740> a<00:05:54.800> lot<00:05:55.099> of<00:05:55.310> high-level

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:55.490 
this is a base at a lot of high-level

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.339 
this is a base at a lot of high-level
players<00:05:55.759> use<00:05:56.149> and<00:05:56.330> it<00:05:56.419> is<00:05:56.509> a<00:05:56.539> difficult<00:05:56.870> base

00:05:57.339 --> 00:05:57.349 
players use and it is a difficult base

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.070 
players use and it is a difficult base
to<00:05:57.589> beat<00:05:57.800> now<00:05:58.339> the<00:05:58.399> cool<00:05:58.879> thing<00:05:58.909> about<00:05:59.479> these

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:00.080 
to beat now the cool thing about these

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:02.800 
to beat now the cool thing about these
kind<00:06:00.349> of<00:06:00.379> basis<00:06:00.800> is<00:06:00.979> that<00:06:01.219> it's<00:06:02.089> hard<00:06:02.479> to<00:06:02.629> beat

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
kind of basis is that it's hard to beat

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.550 
kind of basis is that it's hard to beat
with<00:06:02.959> like<00:06:03.169> go<00:06:03.800> one<00:06:04.009> but<00:06:04.759> it's<00:06:05.659> really<00:06:05.930> easy<00:06:06.379> to

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.560 
with like go one but it's really easy to

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.769 
with like go one but it's really easy to
be<00:06:06.830> with<00:06:07.370> something<00:06:07.819> like<00:06:07.969> all<00:06:08.180> archers<00:06:08.419> the

00:06:08.769 --> 00:06:08.779 
be with something like all archers the

00:06:08.779 --> 00:06:10.119 
be with something like all archers the
reason<00:06:08.990> it's<00:06:09.110> hard<00:06:09.259> what<00:06:09.379> gowipe<00:06:09.649> is<00:06:09.800> because

00:06:10.119 --> 00:06:10.129 
reason it's hard what gowipe is because

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:12.610 
reason it's hard what gowipe is because
the<00:06:10.789> inner<00:06:10.969> circle<00:06:11.330> is<00:06:11.659> made<00:06:11.959> to<00:06:11.990> distract

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:12.620 
the inner circle is made to distract

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:14.860 
the inner circle is made to distract
your<00:06:12.770> go<00:06:12.979> wipe<00:06:13.189> and<00:06:13.430> keep<00:06:14.060> you<00:06:14.209> away<00:06:14.569> from<00:06:14.599> the

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:14.870 
your go wipe and keep you away from the

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:17.159 
your go wipe and keep you away from the
center<00:06:15.169> so<00:06:15.319> you<00:06:15.379> can't<00:06:15.680> jump<00:06:16.009> spell<00:06:16.310> in<00:06:16.520> easily

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:17.169 
center so you can't jump spell in easily

00:06:17.169 --> 00:06:19.089 
center so you can't jump spell in easily
that's<00:06:18.169> just<00:06:18.319> because<00:06:18.499> of<00:06:18.709> the<00:06:18.740> place<00:06:18.949> where

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
that's just because of the place where

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:20.949 
that's just because of the place where
the<00:06:19.159> defense's<00:06:19.669> versus<00:06:20.089> the<00:06:20.360> placement<00:06:20.870> of

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:20.959 
the defense's versus the placement of

00:06:20.959 --> 00:06:21.519 
the defense's versus the placement of
the

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:21.529 
the

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:24.009 
the
loot<00:06:21.979> and<00:06:22.219> that<00:06:22.699> makes<00:06:22.909> it's<00:06:23.089> the<00:06:23.509> closest

00:06:24.009 --> 00:06:24.019 
loot and that makes it's the closest

00:06:24.019 --> 00:06:26.559 
loot and that makes it's the closest
defense<00:06:24.769> is<00:06:24.949> always<00:06:25.339> in<00:06:25.519> the<00:06:25.549> outside<00:06:26.059> of<00:06:26.329> the

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:26.569 
defense is always in the outside of the

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:29.139 
defense is always in the outside of the
middle<00:06:26.809> ring<00:06:27.019> so<00:06:27.319> it's<00:06:27.469> not<00:06:27.679> it's<00:06:28.459> not<00:06:28.609> even

00:06:29.139 --> 00:06:29.149 
middle ring so it's not it's not even

00:06:29.149 --> 00:06:30.609 
middle ring so it's not it's not even
going<00:06:29.329> to<00:06:29.359> ever<00:06:29.509> work<00:06:29.749> so<00:06:30.019> it's<00:06:30.319> actually<00:06:30.589> a

00:06:30.609 --> 00:06:30.619 
going to ever work so it's actually a

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:32.439 
going to ever work so it's actually a
pretty<00:06:30.829> effective<00:06:30.979> base<00:06:31.459> but<00:06:32.029> all<00:06:32.209> archers

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:32.449 
pretty effective base but all archers

00:06:32.449 --> 00:06:34.269 
pretty effective base but all archers
clears<00:06:32.929> it<00:06:33.109> pretty<00:06:33.379> easily<00:06:33.619> for<00:06:34.039> the<00:06:34.099> most

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
clears it pretty easily for the most

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:36.519 
clears it pretty easily for the most
part<00:06:34.429> when<00:06:34.609> I<00:06:34.639> do<00:06:34.759> it<00:06:34.999> and<00:06:35.179> here<00:06:36.079> we<00:06:36.199> go<00:06:36.229> Larry

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:36.529 
part when I do it and here we go Larry

00:06:36.529 --> 00:06:38.379 
part when I do it and here we go Larry
get<00:06:36.829> it<00:06:36.949> thirty-eight<00:06:37.609> percent<00:06:37.789> he<00:06:38.179> got<00:06:38.299> the
