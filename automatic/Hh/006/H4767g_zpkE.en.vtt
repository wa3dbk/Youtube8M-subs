00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:37.609 
final illustration I chose to go ahead

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:40.209 
final illustration I chose to go ahead
and<00:01:37.789> replicate<00:01:38.329> this<00:01:38.479> flower<00:01:38.780> element<00:01:39.439> again

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
and replicate this flower element again

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:42.580 
and replicate this flower element again
and<00:01:40.609> again<00:01:41.030> and<00:01:41.329> again<00:01:41.750> throughout<00:01:42.229> the

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
and again and again throughout the

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.190 
and again and again throughout the
illustration<00:01:43.310> and<00:01:43.520> I<00:01:44.000> decided<00:01:44.359> to<00:01:44.570> do<00:01:44.689> that<00:01:44.899> to

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
illustration and I decided to do that to

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.080 
illustration and I decided to do that to
simplify<00:01:45.770> the<00:01:45.829> project<00:01:46.369> just<00:01:46.549> a<00:01:46.609> little<00:01:46.820> bit<00:01:46.939> I

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
simplify the project just a little bit I

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.450 
simplify the project just a little bit I
also<00:01:47.240> happen<00:01:47.570> to<00:01:47.749> like<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.020> result<00:01:48.469> so<00:01:49.009> again

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
also happen to like the result so again

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.580 
also happen to like the result so again

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
basis of our illustration and I'll show

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.650 
basis of our illustration and I'll show
you<00:02:37.950> how<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.220> introduce<00:02:38.700> the<00:02:38.730> base<00:02:39.120> photograph

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
you how to introduce the base photograph

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.930 
you how to introduce the base photograph
so<00:02:39.870> that<00:02:40.020> we<00:02:40.140> can<00:02:40.290> begin<00:02:40.470> tracing<00:02:41.010> it<00:02:41.340> in<00:02:41.459> the

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
so that we can begin tracing it in the

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.720 
so that we can begin tracing it in the
next<00:02:42.150> exercise
