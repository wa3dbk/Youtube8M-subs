ok<00:02:18.240> so<00:02:18.300> I'm<00:02:18.780> going<00:02:19.020> to<00:02:19.170> let<00:02:19.860> my<00:02:20.010> hair<00:02:20.040> down<00:02:20.700> and

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
I'm thinking this might be the only one

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.990 
I'm thinking this might be the only one
I<00:02:23.610> use<00:02:24.260> you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.440> see<00:02:25.800> how<00:02:26.130> there's<00:02:26.760> my

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
I use you can see how there's my

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.390 
I use you can see how there's my
extension<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:28.140> that's<00:02:28.410> where<00:02:28.650> my<00:02:28.770> hair<00:02:29.070> ends

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
extension and that's where my hair ends

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.690 
extension and that's where my hair ends
but<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.600> can<00:02:30.960> blend<00:02:31.260> it<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.130> make<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.490> look

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
but I can blend it in to make it look

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.750
