00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
never thought i would find a suitable

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.380 
never thought i would find a suitable
replacement<00:00:19.859> for<00:00:20.460> safari<00:00:20.850> in<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.240> app<00:00:21.359> store

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
replacement for safari in the app store

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.679 
replacement for safari in the app store
but<00:00:21.900> atomic<00:00:22.410> web<00:00:22.859> has<00:00:23.100> done<00:00:23.279> just<00:00:23.490> that<00:00:23.689> so

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
but atomic web has done just that so

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.320 
but atomic web has done just that so
i'll<00:00:25.289> show<00:00:25.590> you<00:00:25.650> sort<00:00:26.580> of<00:00:26.640> what<00:00:26.760> makes<00:00:26.910> atomic

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
i'll show you sort of what makes atomic

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.990 
i'll show you sort of what makes atomic
web<00:00:27.510> really<00:00:27.750> good<00:00:28.099> uses<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.160> same<00:00:29.340> WebKit

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
web really good uses the same WebKit

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.400 
web really good uses the same WebKit
rendering<00:00:30.359> engine<00:00:30.570> that<00:00:30.689> Safari<00:00:31.050> does<00:00:31.230> so

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
rendering engine that Safari does so

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.830 
rendering engine that Safari does so
it's<00:00:31.500> basically<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:32.309> reskin<00:00:33.120> Safari<00:00:33.510> but<00:00:33.690> just

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
it's basically a reskin Safari but just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.660 
it's basically a reskin Safari but just
got<00:00:33.930> features<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.440> Safari<00:00:34.800> doesn't<00:00:35.219> have<00:00:35.399> and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
got features as Safari doesn't have and

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.400 
got features as Safari doesn't have and
the<00:00:36.270> features<00:00:36.570> that<00:00:36.600> I<00:00:36.780> like<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.140> fact

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the features that I like of the fact

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.069 
the features that I like of the fact
that<00:00:37.530> you<00:00:38.160> can<00:00:38.370> launch<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:39.000> manage<00:00:39.360> tabs<00:00:39.690> much

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
that you can launch and manage tabs much

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.690 
that you can launch and manage tabs much
more<00:00:40.290> easily<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> much<00:00:40.920> more<00:00:41.100> quickly<00:00:41.399> than

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
more easily and much more quickly than

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.330 
more easily and much more quickly than
safari<00:00:42.050> it's<00:00:43.050> got<00:00:43.260> customizable<00:00:43.920> gestures

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
safari it's got customizable gestures

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.580 
safari it's got customizable gestures
and<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.149> it<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.480> so<00:00:45.539> that<00:00:45.750> two<00:00:46.079> fingers<00:00:46.379> up

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and I have it set so that two fingers up

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.709 
and I have it set so that two fingers up
launches<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> new<00:00:47.579> tab<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.149> can<00:00:48.210> see<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.539> tab

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
launches a new tab you can see in a tab

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.810 
launches a new tab you can see in a tab
bar<00:00:48.899> up<00:00:48.989> here<00:00:49.050> so<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.010> can<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.190> quickly<00:00:50.460> launch

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
bar up here so I can just quickly launch

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.380 
bar up here so I can just quickly launch
a<00:00:50.940> bunch<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> tabs<00:00:51.420> two<00:00:52.050> fingers<00:00:52.199> down<00:00:52.469> closes

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:53.390 
a bunch of tabs two fingers down closes

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.660 
a bunch of tabs two fingers down closes
closed<00:00:54.390> all<00:00:54.570> those<00:00:54.719> tabs<00:00:54.960> real<00:00:55.199> fast<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.710> two

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
closed all those tabs real fast and two

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.840 
closed all those tabs real fast and two
fingers<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.840> right<00:00:58.710> or<00:00:59.010> left<00:00:59.070> moves

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
fingers to the right or left moves

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
fingers to the right or left moves
between<00:01:00.120> tabs<00:01:01.309> and<00:01:02.420> I<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.809> show<00:01:04.080> you<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
between tabs and I will show you the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
between tabs and I will show you the
speed<00:01:05.010> that<00:01:05.250> you<00:01:05.489> can<00:01:05.700> launch<00:01:05.939> three<00:01:06.270> sites<00:01:06.570> in

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
speed that you can launch three sites in

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.350 
speed that you can launch three sites in
both<00:01:07.140> atomic<00:01:07.590> web<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:07.979> Safari<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.790> we'll

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
both atomic web and Safari so we'll

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:31.330 
both atomic web and Safari so we'll
start<00:01:09.600> here

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.520 

so<00:01:31.969> there's<00:01:32.270> three<00:01:32.479> three<00:01:33.049> sites<00:01:33.289> that<00:01:33.469> i

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so there's three three sites that i

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.130 
so there's three three sites that i
pulled<00:01:33.770> up<00:01:33.859> an<00:01:34.310> atomic<00:01:34.670> web<00:01:34.820> and<00:01:35.149> i<00:01:35.600> can<00:01:35.899> switch

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:36.140 
pulled up an atomic web and i can switch

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.260 
pulled up an atomic web and i can switch
between<00:01:36.289> them<00:01:36.649> this<00:01:37.310> quickly<00:01:37.549> and<00:01:40.119> now<00:01:41.119> let's

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
between them this quickly and now let's

00:01:41.270 --> 00:02:07.520 
between them this quickly and now let's
try<00:01:41.359> to<00:01:41.420> do<00:01:41.479> the<00:01:41.569> same<00:01:41.600> thing<00:01:41.899> safari

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.710 

so<00:02:08.190> there<00:02:08.459> I'm<00:02:08.580> able<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.850> pull<00:02:09.000> up<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.240> pages

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
so there I'm able to pull up the pages

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330 
so there I'm able to pull up the pages
about<00:02:09.990> as<00:02:10.229> quick<00:02:10.440> using<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:10.860> bookmark<00:02:11.160> bar

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
about as quick using the bookmark bar

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.090 
about as quick using the bookmark bar
but<00:02:12.030> switching<00:02:12.360> between<00:02:12.569> tabs<00:02:13.020> though<00:02:13.980> it

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
but switching between tabs though it

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.050 
but switching between tabs though it
doesn't<00:02:14.250> seem<00:02:14.459> like<00:02:14.490> it<00:02:14.700> takes<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.000> long

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
doesn't seem like it takes that long

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.390 
doesn't seem like it takes that long
takes<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.080> few<00:02:16.200> seconds<00:02:16.560> each<00:02:16.680> time<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:20.100> when

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
takes a few seconds each time and when

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.710 
takes a few seconds each time and when
you're<00:02:20.670> dealing<00:02:20.880> with<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> lot<00:02:21.180> of<00:02:21.240> tabs<00:02:21.450> it's

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
you're dealing with a lot of tabs it's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.540 
you're dealing with a lot of tabs it's
quite<00:02:22.380> a<00:02:22.410> pain<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.770> go<00:02:22.890> through<00:02:23.040> this<00:02:23.130> menu<00:02:23.370> it

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
quite a pain to go through this menu it

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.500 
quite a pain to go through this menu it
doesn't<00:02:23.760> feel<00:02:23.880> like<00:02:23.940> the<00:02:24.000> most<00:02:24.270> intuitive

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
doesn't feel like the most intuitive

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.860 
doesn't feel like the most intuitive
thing<00:02:24.900> with<00:02:25.680> atomic<00:02:26.130> web<00:02:26.310> you<00:02:27.090> can<00:02:27.270> have<00:02:27.450> your

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
thing with atomic web you can have your

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.620 
thing with atomic web you can have your
tabs<00:02:28.739> loaded<00:02:29.100> at<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.400> top<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.270> the<00:02:30.450> page<00:02:30.720> and

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
tabs loaded at the top of the page and

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.140 
tabs loaded at the top of the page and
switch<00:02:33.630> between<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:34.489> very<00:02:35.489> very<00:02:35.760> easily<00:02:35.970> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
switch between them very very easily and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.449 
switch between them very very easily and
very<00:02:36.270> quickly<00:02:37.010> which<00:02:38.010> i<00:02:38.100> think<00:02:38.160> is<00:02:38.310> awesome

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
very quickly which i think is awesome
