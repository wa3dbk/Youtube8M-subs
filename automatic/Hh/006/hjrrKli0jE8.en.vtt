women's<00:00:36.719> road<00:00:37.079> racing<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.559> think<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.040> is<00:00:38.160> all

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
women's road racing I think that is all

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.069 
women's road racing I think that is all
going<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.940> right<00:00:39.059> direction<00:00:39.239> now<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:39.809> are

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
going in the right direction now we are

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
going in the right direction now we are
getting<00:00:40.230> more<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.649> more<00:00:40.710> events<00:00:41.270> we've<00:00:42.270> heard

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
getting more and more events we've heard

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.970 
getting more and more events we've heard
in<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.660> last<00:00:42.780> couple<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.140> days<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.770> some

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
in the last couple of days that's some

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.729 
in the last couple of days that's some
more<00:00:44.160> events<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:44.879> can<00:00:45.000> have<00:00:45.120> a<00:00:45.210> much<00:00:45.360> stronger

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
more events we can have a much stronger

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:48.440 
more events we can have a much stronger
World<00:00:46.739> Cup<00:00:47.010> calendar<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.820> international

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
World Cup calendar and international

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
World Cup calendar and international
calendar<00:00:48.870> I<00:00:49.020> think<00:00:49.469> we're<00:00:49.590> moving<00:00:49.890> towards

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
calendar I think we're moving towards

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.889 
calendar I think we're moving towards
something<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.820> will<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.480> four<00:00:51.660> for

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
something like a will two or four for

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.569 
something like a will two or four for
women<00:00:52.230> within<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.649> next<00:00:52.770> two<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.039> three<00:00:53.160> years

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
women within the next two or three years

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.580 
women within the next two or three years
I<00:00:53.820> think<00:00:54.180> we're<00:00:54.300> going<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> make<00:00:54.600> some<00:00:54.780> more

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
I think we're going to make some more

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.950 
I think we're going to make some more
developments<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.510> within<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
developments and you know within that

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.420 
developments and you know within that
period<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.379> think<00:00:58.559> we<00:00:58.649> will<00:00:58.710> be<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.190> a<00:00:59.250> position

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
period I think we will be in a position

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.009 
period I think we will be in a position
to<00:00:59.809> establish<00:01:00.809> minimum<00:01:01.620> wage<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.250> women<00:01:02.550> for

00:01:03.009 --> 00:01:03.019 
to establish minimum wage for women for

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:05.750 
to establish minimum wage for women for
professional<00:01:04.019> teams<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:05.040> may<00:01:05.250> mean<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.519> we

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
professional teams that may mean that we

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.670 
professional teams that may mean that we
have<00:01:05.790> perhaps<00:01:06.479> two<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:06.900> three<00:01:07.260> levels<00:01:07.560> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
have perhaps two or three levels of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.530 
have perhaps two or three levels of
women's<00:01:08.310> teams<00:01:08.610> because<00:01:09.090> I<00:01:09.119> think<00:01:09.360> at<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
women's teams because I think at the

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.000 
women's teams because I think at the
moment<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.200> pass<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.560> rule<00:01:10.740> said

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
moment if you just pass the rule said

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.830 
moment if you just pass the rule said
there<00:01:11.189> must<00:01:11.310> be<00:01:11.520> a<00:01:11.549> win<00:01:11.729> a<00:01:11.909> minimum<00:01:12.330> wage<00:01:12.510> for

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
there must be a win a minimum wage for

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.710 
there must be a win a minimum wage for
using<00:01:13.710> our<00:01:13.770> women's<00:01:14.130> teams<00:01:14.340> actually<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
using our women's teams actually that

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.999 
using our women's teams actually that
wouldn't<00:01:15.930> have<00:01:16.140> the<00:01:16.259> desired<00:01:16.619> effect<00:01:16.619> of

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
wouldn't have the desired effect of

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.370 
wouldn't have the desired effect of
making<00:01:17.159> a<00:01:17.430> few<00:01:17.580> hundred<00:01:17.729> women<00:01:18.030> they<00:01:18.990> paid<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
making a few hundred women they paid the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.340 
making a few hundred women they paid the
minimum<00:01:19.500> wage<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.100> would<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:20.909> effect<00:01:21.150> of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
minimum wage it would have the effect of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.410 
minimum wage it would have the effect of
destroying<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.850> reducing<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:24.150> number<00:01:24.270> of

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
destroying and reducing the number of

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.480 
destroying and reducing the number of
teams<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.960> other<00:01:25.320> teams<00:01:25.619> re-registering<00:01:26.310> as

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
teams and other teams re-registering as

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.910 
teams and other teams re-registering as
an<00:01:26.640> amateur<00:01:26.850> teams<00:01:27.270> again<00:01:27.600> so<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:28.560> know<00:01:28.650> it's

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
an amateur teams again so you know it's

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.710 
an amateur teams again so you know it's
not<00:01:29.100> as<00:01:29.250> simple<00:01:29.400> as<00:01:29.610> just<00:01:29.790> passing<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> rule<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
not as simple as just passing a rule and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.359 
not as simple as just passing a rule and
to<00:01:31.380> say<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.770> there<00:01:31.920> shall<00:01:32.100> be<00:01:32.159> a<00:01:32.310> minimum

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
to say that there shall be a minimum

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.280 
to say that there shall be a minimum
wage<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> what<00:01:33.630> we're<00:01:33.780> trying<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.200> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
wage it's a what we're trying to do is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260

the women's side of the sport and I
think<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:39.240> think<00:01:39.540> we've<00:01:39.659> seen<00:01:39.750> some<00:01:39.930> really

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
think I think we've seen some really

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.280 
think I think we've seen some really
useful<00:01:41.250> elements<00:01:42.000> and<00:01:42.360> progression<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:42.930> that

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
useful elements and progression in that

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.740 
useful elements and progression in that
has<00:01:43.920> been<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.189> biggest<00:01:44.340> step<00:01:45.210> or<00:01:45.390> progression

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
has been the biggest step or progression

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.420 
has been the biggest step or progression
in<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.960> last<00:01:46.200> twelve<00:01:46.590> or<00:01:46.710> so<00:01:46.740> months<00:01:47.070> in<00:01:47.250> terms

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
in the last twelve or so months in terms

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.639 
in the last twelve or so months in terms
of<00:01:47.490> women's<00:01:47.820> cycling<00:01:48.000> well<00:01:48.990> I<00:01:49.020> think<00:01:49.200> the

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
of women's cycling well I think the

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.289

the relaunch of the women's world world
world<00:01:55.770> cup<00:01:56.130> has<00:01:56.310> been<00:01:56.659> absolutely<00:01:57.659> pivotal<00:01:58.140> to

events<00:02:00.360> like<00:02:00.509> Latour<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:01.409> also<00:02:02.399> standalone

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
events like Latour and also standalone

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.330 
events like Latour and also standalone
events<00:02:03.329> like<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:04.140> women's<00:02:04.649> tour<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.100> Friends

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
events like the women's tour the Friends

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.249 
events like the women's tour the Friends
Life<00:02:05.460> women's<00:02:05.820> tour<00:02:06.030> in<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.360> UK<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.840> mean<00:02:07.110> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
Life women's tour in the UK I mean that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.719 
Life women's tour in the UK I mean that
was<00:02:07.409> that's<00:02:07.710> been<00:02:07.950> a<00:02:07.979> great<00:02:08.250> event<00:02:08.399> and<00:02:08.640> it

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
was that's been a great event and it

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.339 
was that's been a great event and it
demonstrates<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.569> my<00:02:09.929> point<00:02:10.259> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
demonstrates I think my point that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.140 
demonstrates I think my point that
women's<00:02:10.800> events<00:02:11.129> don't<00:02:11.370> always<00:02:11.760> need<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.120> be

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
women's events don't always need to be

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.420 
women's events don't always need to be
secondary<00:02:12.959> or<00:02:13.170> so

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
secondary or so

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.920 
secondary or so
surgery<00:02:13.730> to<00:02:13.879> men's<00:02:14.060> events<00:02:14.420> that<00:02:14.569> can<00:02:14.719> stand

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
surgery to men's events that can stand

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.160 
surgery to men's events that can stand
on<00:02:15.140> their<00:02:15.290> own<00:02:15.319> and<00:02:16.099> be<00:02:16.280> really<00:02:16.549> successful
