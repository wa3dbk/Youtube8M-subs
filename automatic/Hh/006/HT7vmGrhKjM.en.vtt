definitely a hands-on curriculum from
the<00:01:06.070> schools<00:01:06.340> I've<00:01:06.550> looked<00:01:06.790> into<00:01:06.970> OCC<00:01:07.930> I<00:01:07.960> was

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
awesome cooking every day five hours a

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:22.109 
awesome cooking every day five hours a
day<00:01:20.350> in<00:01:20.530> the<00:01:20.619> kitchen<00:01:20.950> was<00:01:21.430> a<00:01:21.460> dream<00:01:21.790> for<00:01:21.820> me

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:22.119 
day in the kitchen was a dream for me

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:24.660 
day in the kitchen was a dream for me
and<00:01:22.390> it<00:01:22.600> was<00:01:22.720> so<00:01:22.960> hands-on<00:01:23.560> and<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.280> was<00:01:24.399> so

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
and it was so hands-on and it was so

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.029 
and it was so hands-on and it was so
like<00:01:25.030> everything<00:01:25.600> I<00:01:25.690> wanted<00:01:26.080> in<00:01:26.319> a<00:01:26.410> culinary

00:01:27.029 --> 00:01:27.039 
like everything I wanted in a culinary

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:28.800 
like everything I wanted in a culinary
school<00:01:27.369> I<00:01:27.640> think<00:01:27.819> the<00:01:28.000> difference<00:01:28.390> that<00:01:28.479> sets

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
school I think the difference that sets

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.650 
school I think the difference that sets
OCC<00:01:29.470> apart<00:01:29.860> from<00:01:30.069> a<00:01:30.190> lot<00:01:30.399> of<00:01:30.459> other<00:01:30.850> culinary

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:31.660 
OCC apart from a lot of other culinary

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.199 
OCC apart from a lot of other culinary
schools<00:01:31.929> is<00:01:32.289> the<00:01:33.220> attention<00:01:33.789> that<00:01:33.819> you'll<00:01:34.030> get

00:01:34.199 --> 00:01:34.209 
schools is the attention that you'll get

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:36.210 
schools is the attention that you'll get
from<00:01:34.390> your<00:01:34.509> chef<00:01:34.720> instructors<00:01:35.229> our

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
connection and the level of knowledge

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.169
