00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:24.909 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.740 

okay<00:01:25.909> there<00:01:26.150> it<00:01:26.240> is<00:01:28.060> I'm<00:01:29.060> not<00:01:29.120> sure<00:01:29.390> how

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
okay there it is I'm not sure how

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.110 
okay there it is I'm not sure how
accurate<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.560> but<00:01:30.740> I'm<00:01:31.460> going<00:01:31.850> to<00:01:31.880> assume

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 
accurate that is but I'm going to assume

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.750 
accurate that is but I'm going to assume
that<00:01:32.840> it<00:01:33.110> is<00:01:33.380> accurate<00:01:33.800> and<00:01:35.020> the<00:01:36.020> last<00:01:36.290> step<00:01:36.760> is

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:37.760 
that it is accurate and the last step is

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:44.140 
that it is accurate and the last step is
to<00:01:38.270> go<00:01:38.510> to<00:01:38.570> file<00:01:38.840> print<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:41.710> then<00:01:42.910> I'm<00:01:43.910> going

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
to go to file print and then I'm going

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.270 
to go to file print and then I'm going
to<00:01:44.240> go<00:01:44.420> to<00:01:44.479> cutepdf<00:01:45.170> writer<00:01:47.890> all<00:01:48.890> right<00:01:49.070> so
