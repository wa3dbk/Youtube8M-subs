00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
the bottom the stairs you need to be

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:43.789 
the bottom the stairs you need to be
careful<00:01:42.930> because<00:01:43.170> there's<00:01:43.380> gonna<00:01:43.439> be<00:01:43.619> three

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
careful because there's gonna be three

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.160 
careful because there's gonna be three
guys<00:01:44.130> with<00:01:44.399> shotguns<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.360> think<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:45.780> first<00:01:45.960> one

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
guys with shotguns I think the first one

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.920 
guys with shotguns I think the first one
I<00:01:46.290> killed<00:01:46.590> was<00:01:46.829> right<00:01:47.009> there<00:01:47.659> most<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
I killed was right there most of the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.240 
I killed was right there most of the
time<00:01:49.110> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.470> move<00:01:49.680> through<00:01:49.890> a<00:01:50.009> little

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
time if you move through a little

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.490 
time if you move through a little
quicker<00:01:50.640> they'll<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.299> at<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:51.990> bottom<00:01:52.170> of<00:01:52.409> the

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
quicker they'll be at the bottom of the

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.760 
quicker they'll be at the bottom of the
stairs<00:01:52.770> already<00:01:53.220> so<00:01:54.149> there's<00:01:54.329> one<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.439> then

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
stairs already so there's one and then

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
stairs already so there's one and then
there's<00:01:56.070> two<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.090> third<00:01:57.240> one<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> killed

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
there's two and the third one I killed

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.080

before from here I advise sprinting
straight<00:02:00.509> up<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.710> mound<00:02:01.979> or<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:03.060> hill<00:02:03.360> or

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
straight up to the mound or the hill or

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.910 
straight up to the mound or the hill or
whatever<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> building<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.560> cut<00:02:04.770> these

whatever in the building to cut these
guys<00:02:05.159> off<00:02:05.460> because<00:02:05.850> we<00:02:06.000> don't<00:02:06.210> walk

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750

positions behind the computers or the
cubicles<00:02:12.540> or<00:02:12.750> whatever<00:02:12.990> because<00:02:13.620> it<00:02:13.860> just

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
cubicles or whatever because it just

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.320 
cubicles or whatever because it just
makes<00:02:14.280> for<00:02:14.430> a<00:02:14.610> longer<00:02:16.130> mission<00:02:17.130> and<00:02:17.370> it'll<00:02:18.180> go

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
makes for a longer mission and it'll go

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.820 
makes for a longer mission and it'll go
a<00:02:18.360> lot<00:02:18.540> more<00:02:18.750> smoothly<00:02:18.990> if<00:02:19.170> you<00:02:19.320> can<00:02:19.470> cut<00:02:19.650> them

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
a lot more smoothly if you can cut them

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.220
