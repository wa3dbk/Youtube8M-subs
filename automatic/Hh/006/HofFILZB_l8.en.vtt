00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
I said what we to do is we're going to

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.179 
I said what we to do is we're going to
turn<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.350> goblet<00:00:04.890> I<00:00:06.229> like<00:00:07.229> to<00:00:07.259> use<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.740> largest

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
turn a goblet I like to use the largest

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.530 
turn a goblet I like to use the largest
possible<00:00:08.370> tools<00:00:08.850> I<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.120> to<00:00:09.600> get<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.840> job<00:00:10.080> done

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:23.050 

here<00:00:15.540> i'm<00:00:15.690> using<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.110> skew

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.790 

use<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.779> Long<00:00:23.960> Point

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
use the Long Point

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.560 
use the Long Point
ok<00:00:26.340> some<00:00:26.550> clearance<00:00:26.970> but<00:00:27.119> I<00:00:27.179> don't<00:00:27.390> want<00:00:27.509> to

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
ok some clearance but I don't want to

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.150 
ok some clearance but I don't want to
remove<00:00:27.779> too<00:00:27.990> much<00:00:28.019> material<00:00:28.289> on<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.890> side

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
remove too much material on that side

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.310 
remove too much material on that side
because<00:00:29.519> i<00:00:29.669> still<00:00:29.849> have<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.060> hollow<00:00:30.320> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because i still have to hollow that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.910 
because i still have to hollow that
portion<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.859> goblet<00:00:33.290> then<00:00:34.290> you<00:00:34.410> just<00:00:34.620> push

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
portion of the goblet then you just push

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.200 
portion of the goblet then you just push
in

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.819 

then<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.809> withdraw<00:00:38.079> the<00:00:38.410> gouge

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
then I withdraw the gouge

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.739 
then I withdraw the gouge
and<00:00:41.100> swing<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.789> around<00:00:41.969> and<00:00:42.420> create<00:00:42.719> a

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
and swing it around and create a

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.639 
and swing it around and create a
hollowing<00:00:43.489> scraping<00:00:44.780> heart<00:00:45.780> scraping<00:00:46.350> part

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649

cut

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.219 

now<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> determine<00:01:08.310> where<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
now you have to determine where the

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.109 
now you have to determine where the
bottom<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.350> the<00:01:10.409> hollow<00:01:10.680> is<00:01:10.950> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.790> like<00:01:12.000> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
bottom of the hollow is and I like to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.080 
bottom of the hollow is and I like to
then<00:01:12.240> shape<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.750> outside<00:01:13.170> of<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.350> goblet<00:01:13.770> to

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
then shape the outside of the goblet to

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.620 
then shape the outside of the goblet to
the<00:01:15.090> internal<00:01:16.940> Halloween<00:01:17.940> cuts<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.300> had<00:01:18.450> just

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:28.500 
so he's good to give yourself some
clearance<00:01:27.370> but<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.760> key<00:01:28.000> is<00:01:28.180> to<00:01:28.360> give

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 
clearance but the key is to give

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.440 
clearance but the key is to give
yourself<00:01:29.310> to<00:01:30.310> remove<00:01:30.550> just<00:01:30.790> enough<00:01:31.000> ways<00:01:31.210> to

yourself to remove just enough ways to
give<00:01:31.570> yourself<00:01:31.660> the<00:01:32.020> clearance<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.500> need

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:32.650

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
without removing so much that you lose

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.830 
without removing so much that you lose

myself that clearance I need and here
i'm<00:02:00.420> using<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.840> peeling<00:02:01.200> cup

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:09.010 

with<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.880> Long<00:02:06.060> Point

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.600 

I<00:02:09.110> want<00:02:09.770> to<00:02:09.830> define<00:02:10.190> the<00:02:10.460> bottom<00:02:10.880> or<00:02:11.590> the

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
I want to define the bottom or the

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.010 
I want to define the bottom or the
intersection<00:02:13.610> of<00:02:13.790> the<00:02:14.090> bottom<00:02:14.420> of<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.570> goblet

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:20.260 
intersection of the bottom of the goblet
with<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:16.240> stem<00:02:17.240> and<00:02:18.250> I'll<00:02:19.250> make<00:02:19.400> a<00:02:19.460> V<00:02:19.730> cut<00:02:20.030> with

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
with the stem and I'll make a V cut with

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:24.130 
with the stem and I'll make a V cut with
the<00:02:20.300> long<00:02:20.630> point<00:02:20.960> of<00:02:21.080> the<00:02:21.170> skew<00:02:22.900> create<00:02:23.900> a<00:02:23.960> nice

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
the long point of the skew create a nice

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:34.059 
the long point of the skew create a nice
detail

00:02:34.059 --> 00:02:34.069 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:47.210

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.710 

I<00:02:47.310> could<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.060> switch

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
I could then switch

00:02:49.720 --> 00:03:17.910 
I could then switch
to<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.320> gouge<00:02:50.620> to<00:02:50.950> create<00:02:51.520> the<00:02:51.700> stem

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.980 

now<00:03:18.520> I<00:03:18.550> like<00:03:18.760> to<00:03:18.790> make<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.090> long<00:03:19.630> point

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 
now I like to make a long point

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:27.570 
now I like to make a long point
hollowing<00:03:20.620> cut

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:29.580 

then<00:03:28.150> continue<00:03:28.720> to<00:03:28.810> use<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:29.050> Long<00:03:29.200> Point<00:03:29.410> to

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
then continue to use the Long Point to

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.740 
then continue to use the Long Point to
make<00:03:29.710> a<00:03:29.740> couple<00:03:30.010> of<00:03:30.100> V<00:03:30.250> cuts<00:03:30.550> and<00:03:31.480> then<00:03:31.630> you're

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:31.750 
make a couple of V cuts and then you're

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.340 
make a couple of V cuts and then you're
almost<00:03:31.900> ready<00:03:32.260> to<00:03:32.440> part<00:03:32.830> it<00:03:32.920> off<00:03:34.050> and<00:03:35.050> there

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
almost ready to part it off and there

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.180 
almost ready to part it off and there
you<00:03:35.440> have<00:03:35.500> it<00:03:36.750> very<00:03:37.750> nice<00:03:37.990> goblet<00:03:38.560> with<00:03:39.040> some

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:39.190 
you have it very nice goblet with some
