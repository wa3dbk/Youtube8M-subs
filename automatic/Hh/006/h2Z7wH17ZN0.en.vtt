00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello everyone we meet today 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.650
 in a new video to draw a 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.570
 pineapple graphic started separating 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.760
 your sheet in three parts the part 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.100
 lower is used to make the basis of 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.109
 pineapple is a form of works that 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.980
 you're hatched by curves in 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.660
 both diagonals 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.660
 so you will get a grid 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.289
 trace the tiles formed by this 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.210
 grid by taking care of the 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:40.920
 separate from each other by a small 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:42.629
 space to give relief I form 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.410
 points on the tiles that are 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.760
 found on the ends of the pineapple 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.989
 I drew the leaves of the threats 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.579
 as we see fit 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.690
 you can watch pictures on 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.690
 internet to help you 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.539
 trace your pineapple in black fine felt 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.879
 erase the lines of your fat who if he 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.070
 left then color to large 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:07.570
 border paper on each tile 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.090
 pineapple to give an impression 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.140
 depth 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.420
 then add a small pattern 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.420
 geometric to adorn your pineapple 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:40.040
 once I went back to my 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.710
 pineapple leaves I mark using 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.750
 a thin line separation between light 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:50.210
 and light on the leaves I do them 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.190
 a little to the feeling and then coloring to 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.580
 using a felt thicker areas 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.580
 of shadow 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.340
 using the snap side app 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:13.590
 I increase the contrast and I reach 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.750
 at most the saturation of my photo 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.780
 to have a picture letters in black and 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.780
 White 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 to draw on my t-shirt I use 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:55.340
 of textile painting to create the 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.800
 shadows on the leaves 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.700
 I use a brush very little soaked in 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.560
 paint and I rub it on my t-shirt 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:05.570
 I changed the geometric pattern that 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.459
 I made on the pineapple mountain as you 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:09.200
 see we can put a little bit everything 

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:11.450
 what we want I did not have dye 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.150
 auch colors textile to add 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.370
 of color on my pineapple I took 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.660
 attention charpy felts because 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.220
 the first machine wash 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.220
 there may be some burrs 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.320
 according to the usage tips of the 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.240
 textile painting one must first let 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.620
 to dry our breasts in the open air and 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.620
 the past to the iron 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.870
