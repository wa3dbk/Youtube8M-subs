you<00:01:14.280> can<00:01:14.640> see<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.030> yourself<00:01:15.510> like<00:01:15.840> it's

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:16.230 
you can see for yourself like it's

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.100 
you can see for yourself like it's
definitely<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.730> just<00:01:17.970> doing<00:01:18.210> both<00:01:18.780> it's

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
definitely it's just doing both it's

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
giving me length and volume and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.380 
giving me length and volume and
separation<00:01:21.920> I'm<00:01:22.920> really<00:01:23.520> really<00:01:23.790> liking<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
separation I'm really really liking this

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.090 
separation I'm really really liking this
I'm<00:01:24.840> just<00:01:24.990> obviously<00:01:25.200> gonna<00:01:25.530> go<00:01:25.680> into<00:01:25.860> another

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
I'm just obviously gonna go into another

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.780 
I'm just obviously gonna go into another
coat<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.790> to<00:01:27.030> show<00:01:27.270> you<00:01:27.330> guys

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.600 

that's<00:01:33.390> it<00:01:33.720> there<00:01:34.050> what<00:01:34.290> two<00:01:34.770> coats<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.460> does

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that's it there what two coats it does

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.160 
that's it there what two coats it does
get<00:01:35.790> kind<00:01:35.940> of<00:01:36.090> clumpy<00:01:36.510> when<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.720> start<00:01:36.960> to<00:01:37.080> do

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
get kind of clumpy when you start to do

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.630 
get kind of clumpy when you start to do
that<00:01:37.320> so<00:01:37.500> maybe<00:01:37.710> you<00:01:37.860> could<00:01:38.040> just<00:01:38.190> stick<00:01:38.490> to

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that so maybe you could just stick to

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.700 
that so maybe you could just stick to
doing<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.840> coat<00:01:40.080> because<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.590> actually

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
doing one coat because it actually

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.650 
doing one coat because it actually
worked<00:01:41.010> really<00:01:41.190> well<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.580> first<00:01:41.850> time<00:01:42.150> okay

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
worked really well the first time okay

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:45.050 
worked really well the first time okay
guys<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> is<00:01:43.350> it<00:01:43.560> as<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:44.400> can<00:01:44.760> see<00:01:44.820> you

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
guys so that is it as you can see you

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.190 
guys so that is it as you can see you
can<00:01:45.180> kind<00:01:45.360> of<00:01:45.390> see<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.660> results<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.110> yourself

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
can kind of see the results for yourself

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.680 
can kind of see the results for yourself
I<00:01:46.830> will<00:01:47.310> say<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.640> formula<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.120> a<00:01:48.180> bit<00:01:48.330> thick<00:01:48.660> so

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
I will say the formula is a bit thick so

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.450 
I will say the formula is a bit thick so
it<00:01:49.020> can<00:01:49.230> be<00:01:49.410> a<00:01:49.440> bit<00:01:49.590> clumpy<00:01:49.800> but<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.190> doesn't

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
it can be a bit clumpy but that doesn't

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.250 
it can be a bit clumpy but that doesn't
really<00:01:50.580> bother<00:01:50.790> me<00:01:51.030> it's<00:01:51.720> definitely<00:01:51.870> giving

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:52.260 
really bother me it's definitely giving

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.710 
really bother me it's definitely giving
me<00:01:52.290> volume<00:01:52.740> quite<00:01:53.730> a<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.120> length<00:01:54.270> it's

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
me volume quite a bit of length it's

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.410 
me volume quite a bit of length it's
it's<00:01:55.620> not<00:01:55.800> really<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.370> separating<00:01:57.060> once<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's not really that separating once you

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.380 
it's not really that separating once you
kind<00:01:57.660> of<00:01:57.780> apply<00:01:58.410> a<00:01:58.500> second<00:01:59.100> coat<00:01:59.160> but<00:02:00.090> it<00:02:00.210> does

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
kind of apply a second coat but it does

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.200 
kind of apply a second coat but it does
look<00:02:00.600> definitely<00:02:01.380> quite<00:02:01.860> volumize<00:02:02.460> all<00:02:03.030> right

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
look definitely quite volumize all right

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.150 
look definitely quite volumize all right
