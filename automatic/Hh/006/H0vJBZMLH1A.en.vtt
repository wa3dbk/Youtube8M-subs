seats so it will only take seats from
this<00:01:08.580> chest<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.170> those<00:01:10.170> seats<00:01:10.380> will<00:01:10.590> travel

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
this chest and those seats will travel

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.700 
this chest and those seats will travel
alongside<00:01:11.460> those<00:01:11.909> drop<00:01:12.780> us<00:01:12.930> facing<00:01:13.229> upwards

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
alongside those drop us facing upwards

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.219 
alongside those drop us facing upwards
to<00:01:13.979> this<00:01:14.640> thing<00:01:14.820> I<00:01:14.909> drop<00:01:15.090> above<00:01:15.420> which

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
to this thing I drop above which

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.060 
to this thing I drop above which
constantly<00:01:16.590> will<00:01:16.950> spill<00:01:17.880> out<00:01:18.500> new<00:01:19.500> seats<00:01:19.770> for

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
constantly will spill out new seats for

constantly will spill out new seats for
me<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.490> blend

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.230 

so<00:01:50.740> that's<00:01:51.220> my<00:01:51.370> proof<00:01:51.550> of<00:01:51.670> concept<00:01:52.150> for

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
so that's my proof of concept for

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.450 
so that's my proof of concept for
Minecraft<00:01:52.930> based<00:01:53.170> automatic<00:01:53.830> wheat<00:01:53.950> station

Minecraft based automatic wheat station

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.780 
Minecraft based automatic wheat station
in<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.730> new<00:01:54.850> snapshot<00:01:55.120> I<00:01:55.480> liked<00:01:56.440> it<00:01:56.790> maybe

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
in the new snapshot I liked it maybe

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.340 
in the new snapshot I liked it maybe
you'll<00:01:57.940> find<00:01:58.120> a<00:01:58.180> way<00:01:58.300> to<00:01:58.360> make<00:01:58.630> it<00:01:58.660> more

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
you'll find a way to make it more

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:00.870 
you'll find a way to make it more
compact<00:01:59.770> and<00:01:59.950> all<00:02:00.370> a<00:02:00.400> lot<00:02:00.640> more
