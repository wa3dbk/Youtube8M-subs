movie<00:00:15.360> but<00:00:15.719> let's<00:00:16.139> be<00:00:16.320> honest<00:00:16.710> it's<00:00:16.830> a<00:00:17.130> 2d<00:00:17.520> film

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
movie but let's be honest it's a 2d film

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.240 
movie but let's be honest it's a 2d film
in<00:00:18.060> 3ds<00:00:18.630> clothing<00:00:19.109> characters<00:00:19.770> are<00:00:19.890> designed

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
in 3ds clothing characters are designed

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.130 
in 3ds clothing characters are designed
like<00:00:20.340> 2d<00:00:20.760> animation<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.420> backgrounds<00:00:22.020> look

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
like 2d animation the backgrounds look

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.080 
like 2d animation the backgrounds look
like<00:00:22.260> something<00:00:22.590> out<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.710> 2d<00:00:23.130> animation<00:00:23.760> the

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
like something out of 2d animation the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.820 
like something out of 2d animation the
story<00:00:24.449> is<00:00:24.720> very<00:00:24.750> reminiscent<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.710> the

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
story is very reminiscent of the

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.560 
story is very reminiscent of the
traditional<00:00:26.340> Disney<00:00:26.519> fairy<00:00:26.939> tales<00:00:27.240> it's

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
traditional Disney fairy tales it's

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560 
traditional Disney fairy tales it's
basically<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.289> 2d<00:00:28.769> animated<00:00:29.250> flick<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.300> I'll

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
basically a 2d animated flick so I'll

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.999 
basically a 2d animated flick so I'll
bend<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:30.960> rules<00:00:31.170> a<00:00:31.289> little<00:00:31.320> bit<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.769> review

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
bend the rules a little bit and review

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.190 
bend the rules a little bit and review
this<00:00:32.189> one<00:00:32.369> as<00:00:32.520> well<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.910> also<00:00:33.450> feel<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> a<00:00:34.020> little

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
this one as well I also feel it a little

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.930 
this one as well I also feel it a little
bit<00:00:34.320> necessary<00:00:34.800> to<00:00:34.950> compare<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> last

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
bit necessary to compare it to the last

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.910 
bit necessary to compare it to the last
2d<00:00:36.450> anime<00:00:36.780> film<00:00:37.110> The<00:00:37.230> Princess<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.860> Frog

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
2d anime film The Princess and the Frog

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.369 
2d anime film The Princess and the Frog
I<00:00:38.489> know<00:00:38.700> that's<00:00:39.000> probably<00:00:39.180> not<00:00:39.480> fair<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.290> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I know that's probably not fair to the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.770 
I know that's probably not fair to the
movie<00:00:40.710> but<00:00:40.920> at<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.340> same<00:00:41.550> time<00:00:41.850> one<00:00:42.210> film<00:00:42.510> only

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
movie but at the same time one film only

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.990 
movie but at the same time one film only
did<00:00:42.960> okay<00:00:43.290> and<00:00:43.530> one<00:00:43.800> film<00:00:44.040> did<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.670> better

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
did okay and one film did a lot better

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.580 
did okay and one film did a lot better
and<00:00:45.239> this<00:00:45.510> was<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:45.989> that<00:00:46.200> did<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> lot

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
and this was the one that did a lot

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
and this was the one that did a lot
better<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:47.280> seeing<00:00:47.550> how<00:00:47.640> they<00:00:47.760> came<00:00:47.910> out

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
better and seeing how they came out

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.520 
better and seeing how they came out
back-to-back<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.750> guess<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.020> does<00:00:49.170> make<00:00:49.200> sense

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
back-to-back I guess it does make sense

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.170 
back-to-back I guess it does make sense
to<00:00:49.770> see<00:00:49.920> why<00:00:50.129> one<00:00:50.370> did<00:00:50.579> better<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.030> other

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
to see why one did better than the other

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.270 
to see why one did better than the other
so<00:00:51.780> let's<00:00:52.020> talk<00:00:52.199> about<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.590> absolute<00:00:53.039> best

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
so let's talk about the absolute best

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.389 
so let's talk about the absolute best
aspect<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> film<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.930> story<00:00:55.559> and<00:00:55.980> it's

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
aspect of the film the story and it's

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.549 
aspect of the film the story and it's
rare<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:57.000> say<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.480> but<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> story<00:00:58.320> to

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
rare that I say that but the story to

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.369 
rare that I say that but the story to
this<00:00:58.680> film<00:00:59.070> is<00:00:59.329> brilliant<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.140> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
this film is brilliant this is the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.380 
this film is brilliant this is the
classic<00:01:01.859> retelling<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.730> fairy<00:01:03.000> tale<00:01:03.090> that

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
classic retelling of a fairy tale that

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
classic retelling of a fairy tale that
Disney<00:01:03.809> used<00:01:04.080> to<00:01:04.290> do<00:01:04.470> best

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
Disney used to do best

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.070 
Disney used to do best
it's<00:01:05.369> not<00:01:05.610> exactly<00:01:06.000> like<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.390> original<00:01:06.869> but

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
it's not exactly like the original but

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.810 
it's not exactly like the original but
the<00:01:07.200> changes<00:01:07.619> are<00:01:07.680> not<00:01:08.010> only<00:01:08.250> incredibly

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
the changes are not only incredibly

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.640 
the changes are not only incredibly
creative<00:01:09.180> but<00:01:09.689> half<00:01:09.930> the<00:01:10.110> time<00:01:10.290> they're

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
creative but half the time they're

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.770 
creative but half the time they're
improvements<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.700> transitions<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> story

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
improvements it transitions the story

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.230 
improvements it transitions the story
into<00:01:13.080> film<00:01:13.350> perfectly<00:01:14.070> okay<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:14.610> what<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> it

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
is it a race issue could be is it

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.580 
is it a race issue could be is it
because<00:05:00.270> there's<00:05:00.510> more<00:05:00.660> guitar<00:05:01.020> playing<00:05:01.350> pop

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:01.590

sound<00:05:05.160> that's<00:05:05.610> possible<00:05:06.030> too<00:05:06.240> but<00:05:06.750> again<00:05:06.900> I

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
sound that's possible too but again I

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:09.380 
sound that's possible too but again I
think<00:05:07.620> it<00:05:07.740> comes<00:05:07.890> back<00:05:08.010> to<00:05:08.310> my<00:05:08.460> original<00:05:08.610> very

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:09.390

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.680 
think it comes back to my original very
3d<00:05:10.260> animation<00:05:11.130> I<00:05:11.340> think<00:05:11.820> the<00:05:11.970> film<00:05:12.240> did<00:05:12.480> well

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
3d animation I think the film did well

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.450 
3d animation I think the film did well
because<00:05:13.080> the<00:05:13.200> advertising<00:05:13.680> played<00:05:14.070> up<00:05:14.250> that

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
because the advertising played up that

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.100 
because the advertising played up that
there's<00:05:14.640> gonna<00:05:14.820> be<00:05:14.940> more<00:05:15.090> adult<00:05:15.600> jokes<00:05:15.870> even

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110 
there's gonna be more adult jokes even

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.960 
there's gonna be more adult jokes even
though<00:05:16.380> there<00:05:16.590> weren't<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:16.920> many<00:05:16.980> the<00:05:17.730> fact

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
though there weren't that many the fact

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.240 
though there weren't that many the fact
that<00:05:18.120> the<00:05:18.240> story<00:05:18.510> to<00:05:18.780> its<00:05:19.230> credit<00:05:19.770> was<00:05:19.950> a<00:05:19.980> lot

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
that the story to its credit was a lot

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.680 
that the story to its credit was a lot
more<00:05:20.280> simpler<00:05:20.880> than<00:05:21.090> princess<00:05:21.450> in<00:05:21.600> the<00:05:21.660> frog

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:21.690 
more simpler than princess in the frog

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:24.590 
more simpler than princess in the frog
and<00:05:22.200> like<00:05:22.980> I<00:05:23.160> said<00:05:23.220> the<00:05:23.730> fact<00:05:23.910> that<00:05:24.060> this<00:05:24.240> 3d

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
and like I said the fact that this 3d

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.360 
and like I said the fact that this 3d
animation<00:05:25.170> makes<00:05:25.380> adults<00:05:25.860> think<00:05:26.070> that<00:05:26.220> it's

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:26.370 
animation makes adults think that it's

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:27.860 
animation makes adults think that it's
gonna<00:05:26.520> be<00:05:26.700> made<00:05:26.910> for<00:05:27.150> them<00:05:27.300> too

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:27.870 
gonna be made for them too
