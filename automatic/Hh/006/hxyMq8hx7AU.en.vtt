Anderson<00:00:39.360> Silva<00:00:39.540> ended<00:00:39.930> up<00:00:40.050> losing<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.440> fight

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
Anderson Silva ended up losing a fight

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.360 
Anderson Silva ended up losing a fight
by<00:00:40.860> knockout<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:42.379> he<00:00:43.379> was<00:00:43.530> showboating<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
by knockout and he was showboating it

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
by knockout and he was showboating it
was<00:00:44.489> being<00:00:44.760> cocky<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.480> I<00:00:46.079> guess<00:00:46.260> in<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.559> way<00:00:46.590> he

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
was being cocky and I guess in a way he

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.240 
was being cocky and I guess in a way he
deserves<00:00:47.250> it<00:00:47.460> because<00:00:47.760> he<00:00:47.940> wasn't<00:00:48.149> really

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
deserves it because he wasn't really

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.650 
deserves it because he wasn't really
paying<00:00:50.250> full<00:00:50.520> attention<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.180> fight<00:00:51.510> he

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
paying full attention to the fight he

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.959 
paying full attention to the fight he
wasn't<00:00:51.989> taking<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.500> seriously<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.219> he<00:00:53.820> got

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
wasn't taking that seriously and he got

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.529 
wasn't taking that seriously and he got
knocked<00:00:54.210> out<00:00:54.420> for<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.280> in<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.370> rematch<00:00:56.730> this

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
knocked out for it and in a rematch this

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.860 
knocked out for it and in a rematch this
rematch<00:00:57.989> that's<00:00:58.260> coming<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.649> pretty<00:00:58.859> soon<00:00:59.129> I

00:00:59.860 --> 00:00:59.870 
rematch that's coming up pretty soon I

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.880 
rematch that's coming up pretty soon I
believe<00:01:00.870> people<00:01:01.079> win<00:01:01.350> this<00:01:01.440> time<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> believe

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
believe people win this time I believe

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.640 
believe people win this time I believe
that<00:01:02.160> he<00:01:02.520> won't<00:01:02.670> be<00:01:02.760> showboating<00:01:03.449> if<00:01:04.229> he<00:01:04.439> does

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
that he won't be showboating if he does

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.789 
that he won't be showboating if he does
then<00:01:05.519> he<00:01:06.210> will<00:01:06.360> get<00:01:06.540> knocked<00:01:06.750> out<00:01:06.990> again<00:01:07.350> but<00:01:07.560> I

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
then he will get knocked out again but I

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.289 
then he will get knocked out again but I
think<00:01:08.040> he<00:01:08.280> will<00:01:08.400> take<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.670> fight<00:01:08.880> seriously

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
think he will take this fight seriously

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.560 
think he will take this fight seriously
this<00:01:09.420> time<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:09.930> I<00:01:10.470> think<00:01:10.619> he<00:01:10.830> will<00:01:11.070> win<00:01:11.570> by

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
this time and I think he will win by

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.950 
this time and I think he will win by
submission<00:01:12.630> or<00:01:13.229> by<00:01:13.260> decision<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.720> but<00:01:15.720> you

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
submission or by decision and but you

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.060 
submission or by decision and but you
never<00:01:16.110> know<00:01:16.320> man<00:01:16.500> I<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.770> he's<00:01:16.860> already

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
never know man I think he's already

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.679 
never know man I think he's already
getting<00:01:17.369> up<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.850> age<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.030> believe<00:01:18.299> is<00:01:18.450> in

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
getting up there in age I believe is in

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
a chance by the way bike for Chris with

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.730 
a chance by the way bike for Chris with
Weidman<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.600> prove<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.140> doubters<00:01:40.560> out<00:01:40.680> there

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
Weidman to prove the doubters out there

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.300 
Weidman to prove the doubters out there
because<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.189> lot<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> people<00:01:41.759> believe<00:01:42.090> that<00:01:42.119> I

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
because a lot of people believe that I

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.789 
because a lot of people believe that I
understand<00:01:44.310> Silva<00:01:44.759> just<00:01:45.470> threw<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.619> fight

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
understand Silva just threw the fight

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
understand Silva just threw the fight
away<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.250> in<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> way<00:01:47.610> I<00:01:47.640> guess<00:01:47.790> he<00:01:48.119> did<00:01:48.329> but

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
away and in a way I guess he did but

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.300 
away and in a way I guess he did but
without<00:01:49.200> being<00:01:49.439> said<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.860> was<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:49.979> great

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
without being said it was a great

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.950 
without being said it was a great
victory<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:51.119> first<00:01:51.329> fight<00:01:51.509> was<00:01:51.630> a<00:01:51.659> great

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
victory the first fight was a great

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530 
victory the first fight was a great
victory<00:01:52.170> by<00:01:52.649> Chris<00:01:52.950> Weidman<00:01:53.189> I<00:01:53.430> mean<00:01:53.670> he

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
victory by Chris Weidman I mean he

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.420 
victory by Chris Weidman I mean he
deserved<00:01:54.960> that<00:01:55.079> winner<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.740> it<00:01:56.009> was<00:01:56.159> it

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
deserved that winner and it was it

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.270 
deserved that winner and it was it
wasn't<00:01:56.640> his<00:01:56.880> fault<00:01:57.090> that<00:01:57.229> I<00:01:58.229> understand<00:01:58.950> Silva

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
wasn't his fault that I understand Silva

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.630 
wasn't his fault that I understand Silva
was<00:01:59.460> showboating<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.299> all<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> shit<00:02:00.810> but

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
was showboating and all that shit but

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.100 
was showboating and all that shit but
hopefully<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.790> next<00:02:03.119> fight<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> rematch
