00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.500
 no no 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.120
 i ii and iii 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:22.170
 to that the rics 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 minecraft and I bring a new tutorial that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.250
 I'm going to explain how the 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.410
 Enchantment tables and how are you? 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.050
 seeing this crystal here represent 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.820
 bookstores worth and this would be the 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.250
 structure that we had to create for 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.519
 get the highest level before the 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.160
 1.3 points 2 the maximum level was 50 and 

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:43.350
 the bookstores to use 30 however what 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.290
 modified and here we have the 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:48.600
 we need now that they are 15 vouchers and 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.690
 we would get the maximum level that is the 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.300
 30 the areas where we can put 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.120
 bookstores are these corners too 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.990
 affect it's worth and we could put in all 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.300
 these areas here 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:04.180
 the basic model is valid and the most 

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:06.340
 usa is this entry here is worth and as 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.540
 you are seeing around here we reach the maximum 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:10.570
 level 30 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.760
 using 15 bookstores however as you 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.480
 explained here we can use the corners 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:17.740
 or a double height to make it less 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 spacious is worth it and make it more 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.190
 tiny as you see here level 30 equal 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.440
 that here very well and here you have another 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.650
 pretty curious way to get to the 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.350
 level 30 here you see it perfectly and 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:34.990
 what is this good for? 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.430
 but this is already a ritz nonsense not what 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.229
 it's because as you see here 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.080
 this charms table is totally 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.479
 cover is worth obsidian and without 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:46.810
 However if I give it here I reach level 30 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.119
 this is true because here it is worth not 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:50.440
 it affects you that there are blocks and it is just what 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:53.560
 that we have here in this little 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.930
 structure very well guys you see that for 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.780
 there is water here, when we 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:01.450
 we come here tachÃ¡n do not affect them 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.640
 these bookstores worth that what it does is 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.480
 that water when it passes through here or 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.580
 apparent blocks 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.070
 what they block is the signal of the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.770
 bookstore to the table of enchantments and 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.390
 therefore it does not effect very well 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.450
 let's see a little bit this 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.520
 will remember my departure from his rival 1.4 in 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.130
 which I do not have here the maximum level of 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.410
 26 since that is where most likely 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.410
 I have to find the enchantment of 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:31.020
 fidel falling 4 spending less diamond 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:34.410
 so then the truth is that it is 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.480
 quite interesting to know where and 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.190
 how are we going to get enchantments 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.040
 then or I will explain it later with 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:44.040
 a resource that is on the internet is worth it here 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.620
 you have a library missing and we arrived 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.010
 at level 28, each library affects two 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:55.230
 levels for example here you see that the 26 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:58.920
 here 24 here 22 as you are seeing here 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.770
 would be 20 and as you see here I have already removed 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.650
 a few more specifically there are only 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:07.530
 three four five seven and as you see here 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.660
 I give it to 14 and it does not change however 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.610
 when we remove the seventh and it 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.920
 they remain in 6 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:17.280
 that stays at 12 and when we go to 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:19.740
 remove would stay at 14 10 and can 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.080
 change 13 and it becomes a little 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.000
 crazy is worth so this is where 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.280
 is normal and here it starts to be a 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.260
 little bit randomly we go back to 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.070
 back and I'll explain the blocks 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.650
 that can break the signal of the 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.570
 bookstores very well transparent blocks 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.360
 and solid is worth as well are the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:43.890
 torches as you see here they block me the 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.470
 enchantments here would be the ones 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.410
 crystals these two paint laws here 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.959
 we would have vines as you see me 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.760
 affect they are worth they do not let pass the signal and 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.340
 here we would have a lot more objects 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.590
 how can they be like web go a pot 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:01.170
 good many things as you see are 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.940
 here put all in random order and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.400
 when I put here it does not let me 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.950
 absolutely nothing because here I have a 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.450
 grass ladder a mushroom an eco web 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.520
 well I have different things that what 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:15.180
 do is they do not pass the signal 

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:16.769
 unite however the entities let us 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.900
 happen 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.900
 As you can see here I have a picture as you see 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:24.690
 I have a frame item here and I put it here 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.699
 one of these and strike out for example if 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.400
 we put on thomis because not 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.620
 we are going to break the signal however 

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.470
 there are some entities that do 

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.740
 block as they are the normal trunk or the 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.930
 chest to sell and sell chest and as 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.940
 You see act as a block, it's worth 

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.940
 it is a little special entity and 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:47.550
 they would still block us the signal and guys 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:49.620
 before finishing this tutorial we are going to 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.659
 see that little thing that is next to there 

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.610

 26 here where we came from guys we have a 

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:25.190

 4 if you love we go some boots 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:30.410

 we can do with all of them 

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:35.330
 enchantments all the tools the 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.590
 truth is that it is something very very useful and 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:38.360
 we can also do 

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:41.120
 watt in chad minds carney get forex 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.120

 we can get in a stop s in a 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:51.500
 Gold sword with level 30 not better with 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:57.099
