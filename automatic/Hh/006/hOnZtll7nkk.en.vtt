 They are the best compared 20 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.980
 Well first of all I want to give you 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.200

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.539
 video of the resurrection of benítez no 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.340
 I expected to receive so many more than 200 likes 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.110
 likes was like wow a lot of thank you 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.059
 for all your support with passing that I love you 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.710
 and I carry them in my heart wherever 

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:33.480
 I go and everything that happens on the day of 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.890
 today I bring you a video something different 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.300
 on the channel since I'm going to talk a little 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.980
 about news we are not going to talk about 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.270
 gameplay and well if I know what I said 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.860
 I was going to tell you a little about my story 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.740
 in this summer camp and if I'm going to do it 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.750
 I'm going to take the time to do them some 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:46.680
 series of videos some 4 or 5 videos yo 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.780
 I think they would be perfect for 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.280
 tell them everything I experienced but 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.680
 good now is the feeling is the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.690
 fever that he just got on yesterday 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.250
 decoder and coast revelation trailer and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.470
 Well, I'm going to bring you more than 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.060
 nothing like the key points like a 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.530
 summary I did not have the opportunity as 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.059
 some youtube the very big ones to go to 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.700
 this event where they could play it 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.020
 until it explodes them from the brain I do not 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.540
 I had the opportunity they were proposed not 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.490
 I'm going to tell you what I saw in the 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.140
 this conference that lasted an hour I'm going to 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.370
 say the key points they commented 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:21.630
 these the designers 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:22.890
 first part again in the morning 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.260
 the interview and I began to notice the 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.880
 key points and received was like what 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.620
 I saw yesterday and I saw him again today and I gave myself 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.930
 count many things today then 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.050
 then he's going to have another one hung but 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.640
 again so that I stay completely 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.230
 established what they say well proposed 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.950
 not now I'm going to talk to you a little bit 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:45.180
 as in summary very brief what he said 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.250
 the ceo of activision eric hirshberg I think 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.420
 that's how you pronounce your name sorry yes 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.010
 pronounced more newspapers are 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.470
 watching this video of eric because it's my 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.270
 fan but good yes as I say I 'm going to 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.650
 tell them the points as keys that he 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.170
 He said how this is going to change 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.220
 this is the new thing and so good we are going to 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.960
 start compass for the first point 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.700
 we have no longer going to have classes now 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.070
 you are going to have a soldier and with a group of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.950
 soldiers are going to generate a squat then 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.899
 well, it's something quite between 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.670
 new quotes since we're not going to 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.680
 have classics have soldiers then to 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.500
 all to put put the soldier sucked and 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.720
 you 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.489
 emery kitchin osuna the engine running 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.540
 like rambo and you're going to be able to have a 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.299
 Scullion 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.930
 the skinny was going to walk with lightweight 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:29.819
 marathon and commando pro cabrón would happen 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.400
 to have classes now we are going to have 

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:33.450
 soldiers another new thing that said this 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.859
 it's good this we've already seen in 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.560
 some other games including 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.319
 famously known bar outfield goes to 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.450
 have new maps that are dynamic and 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.560
 interactive or something that we have already 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.239
 seen as I tell you in some other 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.730
 games but this is very good is of the 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.959
 code tour and since as him 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.760
 he said it is very common that in call of duty 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:55.290
 let's perfectly know the maps 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090
 let's know we know all the routes 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:59.519
 but now we're not just going to have 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.290
 that know the routes but how it works 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:03.269
 this interaction with maps for 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.069
 you know fuckin 'covered me over here now 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:06.269
 I have to go here is something like them 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.590
 I say the people who can have adducted 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.359
 our nothing surprised but for the 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.400
 people that we play only code like me 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:12.540
 I've played for or twice as 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.489
 good is something quite new and 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.340
 refreshing for the co2 saga during 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.169
 there are seven new types of game that 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.540
 you can catch up to see they were like crank 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:23.910
 it was like eating here I wrote them down 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.680
 they were great 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.240
 and we're going to take a little time in 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.620
 some other video to comment on their 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.810
 new game types but if there are seven 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.480
 new game types there are more than 30 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.490
 new weapons which is something fabulous 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:39.790
 eggs to 30 new weapons when he's not 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:42.640
 something less than a turn color and more than 20 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:44.560
 new kits this is something that is pretty 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.120
 refreshing as I said but also 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:51.010
 it's something quite worrying to me already 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:53.410
 I do not want another mother goose creek 4 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.060
 way please there's nothing else he said 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.590
 that were the new animations to the 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:59.290
 soldiers is something that many saw and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:00.610
 many that surprised us good now in 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.870
 dury games we also have animations 

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.820
 as embargo fields new animations 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.560
 when stabbing the sabanization is 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:07.570
 as felt by the floor on his knees 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.209
 new animations when you jump some 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:12.010
 obstacle new animations to with 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:14.770
 be eating a hamburger or 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.480
 that's something like I'm telling you, it's not said that 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:17.680
 It will be a ham but honest I say 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:19.480
 sincerely in the bottom of my heart 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.970
 like a capture and fan boy is something 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.880
 quite refreshing to see animations in 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.260
 a ping guys bone walk that is going to us 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.000
 fail to impress week 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.310
 play it but well they are worrying 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.220
 something to put the animations 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.520
 and its interactive maps also 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:39.520
 value a new cop not cooperative mode 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:41.170
 which is how I imagine what would come 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:42.550
 being zombies that is not zombies 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:45.160
 obviously but I say is what would come 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.650
 being as equivalent in the center 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:50.740
 d'art age zombies here we have a new 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.930
 cooperative today also good is something 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.270
 that the one who said is this seems to you if 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.700
 I make this character that we are going to have 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:05:00.430
 like a cloud a cloud like berlin 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.960
 that it does not matter where you play in what 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.610
 part of the world you do not care if you 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:06.220
 You change generation of consoles 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.440
 xbox 360 xbox one your profile your soldiers 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.000
 your squat your classes are not going to change in 

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.890
 absolute what I think with mothers 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.450
 I was very worried I said good and if 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:16.810
 I get to click prestige and it's in the xbox 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:20.800
 360 and out of nowhere I want to buy myself 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:23.110
 give away or pinche little dog wants to win 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.180
 an xbox wards and what happens not so good 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.730
 we do not have to worry about compass anymore 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.130
 that all our progress in the console 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:31.690
 last will continue in the future console 

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:32.860
 generation and good we will not be able to 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:34.330
 do what we all do that 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:35.710
 we are in the starbucks one a cafe with 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.849
 our friends and we say wait I'm going 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:39.009
 to leave my bed my class 

00:05:36.849 --> 00:05:41.709
 of hank aaron and primary of one formed 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:43.749
 It is still nobody because I do not stay with 

00:05:41.709 --> 00:05:46.119
 this but good compass is because well its 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:47.529
 displeasure are some key points about 

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.569
 what will change in co2 during coast 

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:51.159
 and well, they wait for three others 

00:05:49.569 --> 00:05:52.719
 two or three videos talking and eating a 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:55.059
 a little more in detail about these 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.819
 changes a little more about what he said 

00:05:55.059 --> 00:06:00.429
 both the bald of infinity ward and not 

00:05:57.819 --> 00:06:01.779
 both the eric ceo and drinking glasses as 

00:06:00.429 --> 00:06:02.949
 I told them it 's because vines and leftovers 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:04.749
 so it was not forget to win a me 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:05.319
 like or let me comment the section of 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:06.639
 comments

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:09.119
 take care
