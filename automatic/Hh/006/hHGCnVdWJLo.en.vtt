there's no need for more than that

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.260 
there's no need for more than that

where<00:02:13.270> you<00:02:13.420> wanna<00:02:13.630> pick<00:02:13.900> always<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.560> highest

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
where you wanna pick always the highest

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.300 
where you wanna pick always the highest
that<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.700> program<00:02:16.090> lets<00:02:16.300> you<00:02:16.950> just<00:02:17.950> in<00:02:18.100> case

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
that the program lets you just in case

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.510 
that the program lets you just in case
all<00:02:18.640> scanners<00:02:19.270> scan<00:02:20.050> at<00:02:20.200> 600<00:02:20.680> dpi<00:02:20.890> no<00:02:21.340> matter

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
all scanners scan at 600 dpi no matter

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.820 
all scanners scan at 600 dpi no matter
if<00:02:21.640> I<00:02:21.730> choose<00:02:21.910> this<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.960> still<00:02:23.260> scanning<00:02:23.620> at

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
if I choose this it's still scanning at

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.540 
if I choose this it's still scanning at
600<00:02:24.400> dpi<00:02:25.320> all<00:02:26.320> this<00:02:26.650> does<00:02:26.920> when<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.310> choose<00:02:27.520> a

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
600 dpi all this does when you choose a

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.650 
600 dpi all this does when you choose a
bigger<00:02:28.030> resolution<00:02:28.740> it<00:02:29.740> pretty<00:02:30.640> much<00:02:30.910> the

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
bigger resolution it pretty much the

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.220 
bigger resolution it pretty much the
program<00:02:32.050> what<00:02:32.440> stool<00:02:32.950> in<00:02:33.160> it's<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.209> kind<00:02:35.140> of

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
program what stool in it's a kind of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.740 
program what stool in it's a kind of
making<00:02:35.500> up<00:02:35.740> more<00:02:35.920> pixels<00:02:36.250> for<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.690> right

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
making up more pixels for you all right

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.410 
making up more pixels for you all right
so<00:02:38.050> it's<00:02:38.170> not<00:02:38.230> really<00:02:38.550> scanning<00:02:39.550> at<00:02:39.670> that<00:02:39.850> but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:40.420 
so it's not really scanning at that but

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:42.990 
so it's not really scanning at that but
it's<00:02:40.570> making<00:02:40.780> up<00:02:41.080> more<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.680> don't<00:02:42.670> know<00:02:42.820> if<00:02:42.940> you

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's making up more I don't know if you

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.400 
it's making up more I don't know if you
guys<00:02:43.560> understand<00:02:44.850> but<00:02:45.850> anyways<00:02:46.270> um<00:02:46.510> you're

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
guys understand but anyways um you're

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:48.960 
guys understand but anyways um you're
not<00:02:47.530> really<00:02:47.680> scanning<00:02:48.100> at<00:02:48.220> that<00:02:48.340> right<00:02:48.640> any

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
not really scanning at that right any

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.380 
not really scanning at that right any
resolution<00:02:49.600> I<00:02:49.660> pick<00:02:50.170> walnuts<00:02:50.860> more<00:02:51.730> than<00:02:51.850> 600

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
resolution I pick walnuts more than 600

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.199 
resolution I pick walnuts more than 600
it's<00:02:52.750> really<00:02:53.110> 600<00:02:53.680> dpi<00:02:53.920> that<00:02:54.100> scanning<00:02:54.430> but

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
it's really 600 dpi that scanning but

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.630 
it's really 600 dpi that scanning but
your<00:02:55.450> program<00:02:55.900> is<00:02:56.080> making<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:56.920> larger<00:02:57.070> so<00:02:57.489> it's

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:57.640 
your program is making it larger so it's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:04.440 
your program is making it larger so it's
making<00:02:57.790> up<00:02:58.030> a<00:02:58.120> little<00:02:58.450> pixels<00:02:59.410> so<00:03:03.270> alright<00:03:04.270> so

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
making up a little pixels so alright so

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.420 
making up a little pixels so alright so
I'm<00:03:04.540> just<00:03:04.810> gonna<00:03:04.959> pick<00:03:05.260> this<00:03:05.650> one

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:06.430 
I'm just gonna pick this one

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.760 
I'm just gonna pick this one
we're<00:03:06.820> gonna<00:03:07.000> pick<00:03:07.390> we're<00:03:07.870> scanning<00:03:08.290> some<00:03:08.709> of

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
we're gonna pick we're scanning some of

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:12.150 
we're gonna pick we're scanning some of
my<00:03:08.890> desktop<00:03:09.400> that<00:03:09.550> stays<00:03:09.820> this<00:03:09.970> way<00:03:10.030> name<00:03:11.160> yeah

Photoshop<00:03:17.709> -<00:03:17.860> what<00:03:18.160> do<00:03:18.280> it<00:03:18.370> TIFF<00:03:18.670> TIFF<00:03:19.630> is<00:03:19.840> our

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
Photoshop - what do it TIFF TIFF is our

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:22.050 
Photoshop - what do it TIFF TIFF is our
much<00:03:20.230> larger<00:03:20.709> size<00:03:20.920> so<00:03:21.160> it's<00:03:21.340> nice<00:03:21.640> to<00:03:21.880> have

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
much larger size so it's nice to have

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.780 
much larger size so it's nice to have
that<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.410> I'm<00:03:23.470> just<00:03:23.500> gonna<00:03:23.680> show<00:03:23.890> you<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.190> if<00:03:24.459> it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:24.790 
that so I'm just gonna show you if if it

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.660 
that so I'm just gonna show you if if it
works<00:03:25.000> right<00:03:25.150> now<00:03:25.920> usually<00:03:26.920> with<00:03:27.220> the<00:03:27.340> biggest

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
works right now usually with the biggest

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.370 
works right now usually with the biggest
resolution<00:03:28.330> it<00:03:28.450> doesn't<00:03:28.720> work<00:03:28.810> won't<00:03:29.019> let<00:03:29.230> you

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
resolution it doesn't work won't let you

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:32.009 
resolution it doesn't work won't let you
so<00:03:29.590> I'm<00:03:29.650> just<00:03:29.799> not<00:03:29.920> put<00:03:30.040> scan<00:03:30.280> right<00:03:30.430> there<00:03:31.019> so

00:03:32.009 --> 00:03:32.019 
so I'm just not put scan right there so

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.500 
so I'm just not put scan right there so
sky<00:03:32.590> operations<00:03:33.130> can<00:03:33.340> sold<00:03:33.580> right<00:03:34.120> here<00:03:34.180> is

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
sky operations can sold right here is

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.320 
sky operations can sold right here is
can<00:03:34.720> report<00:03:34.959> an<00:03:35.110> error<00:03:35.230> so<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.920> can<00:03:36.100> so<00:03:36.880> what<00:03:37.209> we

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330 
can report an error so we can so what we

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:40.350 
can report an error so we can so what we
do<00:03:37.540> is<00:03:37.660> bring<00:03:37.900> it<00:03:38.080> down<00:03:38.230> a<00:03:38.260> bit<00:03:39.030> try<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> scan

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:40.360 
do is bring it down a bit try to scan

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.720 
do is bring it down a bit try to scan
that<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.860> doesn't<00:03:42.040> work<00:03:42.220> you<00:03:42.400> bring<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.670> down

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
that that doesn't work you bring it down

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.610 
that that doesn't work you bring it down
a<00:03:42.790> little<00:03:43.030> bit<00:03:43.180> more<00:03:44.940> and<00:03:46.260> I'm<00:03:47.260> not<00:03:47.500> gonna

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.620 
a little bit more and I'm not gonna

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.380 
a little bit more and I'm not gonna
bring<00:03:47.799> more<00:03:48.250> down<00:03:48.459> than<00:03:48.610> that<00:03:48.790> so<00:03:48.940> it<00:03:49.030> doesn't

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:49.390 
bring more down than that so it doesn't

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.900 
bring more down than that so it doesn't
work<00:03:49.480> at<00:03:49.690> that<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.290> I'm<00:03:50.650> just<00:03:50.950> not<00:03:51.130> gonna<00:03:51.519> scan

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
work at that and I'm just not gonna scan

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.479 
work at that and I'm just not gonna scan
it<00:03:52.090> with<00:03:52.690> these<00:03:52.959> settings<00:03:53.260> so<00:03:53.709> I'm<00:03:54.160> just<00:03:54.280> gonna

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
it with these settings so I'm just gonna

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.180 
it with these settings so I'm just gonna
put<00:03:54.610> scan<00:03:54.880> on<00:03:55.000> that<00:03:55.350> okay<00:03:56.350> so<00:03:56.709> I'm<00:03:56.980> just<00:03:57.040> gonna

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
put scan on that okay so I'm just gonna

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.509 
put scan on that okay so I'm just gonna
bring<00:03:57.430> it<00:03:57.579> up<00:03:57.700> again<00:03:57.820> to<00:03:58.150> 48<00:03:58.950> I'm<00:03:59.950> gonna<00:04:00.250> put<00:04:00.400> it

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
bring it up again to 48 I'm gonna put it

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:04.860 
bring it up again to 48 I'm gonna put it
on<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.850> 256<00:04:01.420> grace<00:04:02.850> actually<00:04:03.850> for<00:04:04.420> backing<00:04:04.780> my

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
on to 256 grace actually for backing my

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.420 
on to 256 grace actually for backing my
picture<00:04:05.290> instead<00:04:05.709> of<00:04:05.769> putting<00:04:06.280> 256<00:04:07.090> grace<00:04:08.049> I

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
picture instead of putting 256 grace I

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.979 
picture instead of putting 256 grace I
did<00:04:09.430> notice<00:04:09.700> that<00:04:09.850> if<00:04:10.060> he's<00:04:10.180> coming<00:04:10.390> in<00:04:10.600> Colin

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
did notice that if he's coming in Colin

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.020 
did notice that if he's coming in Colin
then<00:04:11.170> transform<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.980> to<00:04:12.040> black<00:04:12.519> and<00:04:12.730> white<00:04:12.760> in

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
then transform it to black and white in

files so be aware of that well that's
pretty<00:05:54.520> much<00:05:54.639> it<00:05:54.910> for<00:05:54.940> the<00:05:55.210> tutorial<00:05:55.389> using

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
pretty much it for the tutorial using

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:58.770 
pretty much it for the tutorial using
these<00:05:56.169> programs<00:05:56.410> pretty<00:05:56.919> simple<00:05:57.780> from

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
these programs pretty simple from

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:00.900 
these programs pretty simple from
scanning<00:05:59.139> then<00:05:59.470> you<00:05:59.650> you<00:06:00.400> might<00:06:00.580> want<00:06:00.729> to<00:06:00.760> use

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
scanning then you you might want to use

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.120 
scanning then you you might want to use
Photoshop<00:06:01.479> or<00:06:01.660> any<00:06:01.870> other<00:06:01.960> program<00:06:02.710> out<00:06:02.860> there
