00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
using this product after that as I just

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.459 
using this product after that as I just
like<00:01:00.000> the<00:01:00.210> simple<00:01:00.600> basic<00:01:00.930> functionality<00:01:01.440> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
like the simple basic functionality of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.290 
like the simple basic functionality of
it<00:01:01.680> where<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:01.859> didn't<00:01:02.190> always<00:01:02.370> need<00:01:02.609> where<00:01:03.270> I

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
it where I didn't always need where I

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.250 
it where I didn't always need where I
just<00:01:03.420> wanted<00:01:03.690> her<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> tracking<00:01:04.680> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 
just wanted her it not the tracking and

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.490 
just wanted her it not the tracking and
so<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> couple<00:01:07.560> points<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:07.890> note<00:01:08.070> this<00:01:08.580> is<00:01:08.880> an

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
so a couple points to note this is an

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.200 
so a couple points to note this is an
extremely<00:01:10.500> easy<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:11.010> read<00:01:11.220> display<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
extremely easy to read display so

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.490 
extremely easy to read display so
hopefully<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> camera<00:01:12.869> will<00:01:13.110> pick<00:01:13.290> it<00:01:13.320> up

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
hopefully the camera will pick it up

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
hopefully the camera will pick it up
here<00:01:13.799> but<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.430> can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.610> there's<00:01:15.450> two

instead of a pop you pop it out you

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
reconnect it you have pushed this little

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.710 
reconnect it you have pushed this little
button<00:04:25.200> back<00:04:25.470> into<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.830> hole

twist it and snap it back in so it's

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:30.310 
twist it and snap it back in so it's
quite<00:04:29.060> hard<00:04:29.120> to<00:04:29.330> demonstrate<00:04:29.750> on<00:04:29.840> camera

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
quite hard to demonstrate on camera

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.050 
quite hard to demonstrate on camera
but<00:04:30.470> it's<00:04:30.590> very<00:04:30.740> very<00:04:30.860> intuitive<00:04:31.340> and<00:04:31.700> very

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:32.060 
but it's very very intuitive and very

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:35.320 
but it's very very intuitive and very
very<00:04:32.390> easy<00:04:32.450> to<00:04:32.870> do<00:04:33.760> overall<00:04:34.760> I<00:04:34.790> think<00:04:35.000> this<00:04:35.180> is

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
very easy to do overall I think this is

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.480 
very easy to do overall I think this is
a<00:04:35.360> really<00:04:35.630> great<00:04:35.870> product<00:04:36.170> I<00:04:36.320> think<00:04:36.380> it's<00:04:37.040> it

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
a really great product I think it's it

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.460 
a really great product I think it's it
is<00:04:37.760> what<00:04:37.790> it<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.150> it's<00:04:38.360> an<00:04:38.480> entry-level<00:04:38.900> model

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
is what it is it's an entry-level model

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.620 
is what it is it's an entry-level model
but<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:40.010> doesn't<00:04:40.460> mean<00:04:40.580> that<00:04:40.880> it<00:04:41.210> lacks<00:04:41.420> some

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
but that doesn't mean that it lacks some

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:43.810 
but that doesn't mean that it lacks some
features<00:04:41.990> it'll<00:04:42.770> record<00:04:43.100> your<00:04:43.250> average<00:04:43.580> heart

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.670 
spent working at which to be fair
there's<00:04:49.520> not<00:04:49.880> a<00:04:49.910> lot<00:04:50.210> more<00:04:50.480> we<00:04:50.810> can<00:04:51.170> really<00:04:51.440> ask

triathlon<00:05:37.280> based<00:05:37.520> watch<00:05:37.790> which<00:05:37.970> I<00:05:38.090> used<00:05:38.300> for

00:05:38.409 --> 00:05:38.419 
triathlon based watch which I used for

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:41.230 
triathlon based watch which I used for
obviously<00:05:39.110> swim<00:05:39.350> sizing<00:05:39.740> in<00:05:39.860> running<00:05:40.100> and<00:05:40.250> I

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:41.240 
obviously swim sizing in running and I

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:44.200 
obviously swim sizing in running and I
do<00:05:41.870> I<00:05:42.560> do<00:05:42.770> think<00:05:43.070> the<00:05:43.220> Garmin<00:05:43.820> obviously<00:05:44.120> is

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
do I do think the Garmin obviously is

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.550 
do I do think the Garmin obviously is
much<00:05:44.390> more<00:05:44.570> fully<00:05:44.810> featured<00:05:44.990> watch<00:05:45.260> so<00:05:45.440> I<00:05:45.470> do

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:45.560 
much more fully featured watch so I do

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.950 
much more fully featured watch so I do
prefer<00:05:45.979> it<00:05:46.100> but<00:05:46.669> I<00:05:46.910> do<00:05:47.150> I<00:05:47.330> did<00:05:47.660> find<00:05:47.870> myself

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
prefer it but I do I did find myself

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.690 
prefer it but I do I did find myself
using<00:05:48.350> this<00:05:48.530> watching<00:05:48.860> regular<00:05:49.130> basis<00:05:49.460> just

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:49.700 
using this watching regular basis just

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:52.060 
using this watching regular basis just
because<00:05:49.970> of<00:05:50.270> the<00:05:50.570> simple<00:05:51.320> functionality<00:05:51.950> of

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
because of the simple functionality of

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.330 
because of the simple functionality of
it

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
it

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:56.050 
it

often times you perceive your perceived

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:23.230 
often times you perceive your perceived
average<00:06:21.620> is<00:06:21.770> nothing<00:06:22.100> like<00:06:22.370> what<00:06:23.150> you're

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:23.240 
average is nothing like what you're

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:25.659
