 what do you have to tell us the community 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.790
 well, the game is developed by 

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.860
 techland is distributed by warner game 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.659
 day and light and good is a game then 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 of zombie theme that you know that in 

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.440
 the automatic are from today has 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:48.199
 been very strong but that makes it unique 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.570
 this good game that is a game like the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:53.930
 survival horror but first-person 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.030
 scares are the order of the day 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.000
 things get more extreme at night and 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.829
 handles many things from the open world the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.750
 zombies are a little less aggressive 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:05.179
 during the day and at night it starts 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.520
 you start your doing that you are going to hunt 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:09.410
 then that is the most as this 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.179
 deadly the game may have 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.340
 because if you put things sometimes 

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:15.229
 Well crazy there are zombies of different 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.570
 other types that are more lethal in the 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.310
 night and obviously you are the one 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.050
 you must be running and have some 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.759
 mechanical very parents because in fact it was 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.159
 developed with true instructors 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.840
 as the theme of parkour so that the 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.780
 game had that feeling when you 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.950
 you can 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.090
 jumping from building to building be 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.090
 very very very father 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:47.840

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.030
 the new ambience liked new enemies 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.640
 that is changing as you play 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:55.070
 it gets dark it changes all the 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.920
 playability and free mode more than anything 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.900
 be running from the zombies be of 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.020
 jumping side to side and still 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.700
 happening on everyone walking step to 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.510
 step so you do not fall towards the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.510
 sides is the emptiness

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.370
 interesting is about a group of 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.410

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:27.140

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.470
 the safe areas so that it can be 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:37.550
