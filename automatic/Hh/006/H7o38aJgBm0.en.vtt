00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
the 83 woodcutting and 83 fire-making I

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.049 
the 83 woodcutting and 83 fire-making I
just<00:00:32.129> bringing<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.750> hatchet<00:00:34.879> you<00:00:35.879> need<00:00:35.999> a

just bringing you a hatchet you need a
jujus<00:00:36.449> spirit<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.199> did<00:00:37.859> you<00:00:37.949> teleport<00:00:38.249> sphere

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
jujus spirit a did you teleport sphere

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.209 
jujus spirit a did you teleport sphere
bag<00:00:38.789> you<00:00:39.570> can<00:00:39.660> get<00:00:39.749> that<00:00:39.809> at<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.019> GE<00:00:40.260> not<00:00:41.070> that

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
bag you can get that at the GE not that

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.310 
bag you can get that at the GE not that
it's<00:00:41.339> something<00:00:41.940> like<00:00:41.969> 2k<00:00:42.539> for<00:00:42.870> one<00:00:43.079> of<00:00:43.199> them

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
it's something like 2k for one of them

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.950 
it's something like 2k for one of them
it's<00:00:44.280> just<00:00:44.820> basically<00:00:45.239> way<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.449> teleport

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
it's just basically way to teleport

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
alright so once you tell about these two

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.550 
alright so once you tell about these two
displays<00:01:01.520> just<00:01:02.030> face<00:01:02.180> north<00:01:02.540> and<00:01:02.810> going

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:03.560 
displays just face north and going

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:10.780 
displays just face north and going
through<00:01:03.590> these<00:01:03.800> vines<00:01:09.310> just<00:01:10.310> like<00:01:10.460> it's<00:01:10.580> going

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
through these vines just like it's going

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.430 
through these vines just like it's going
to<00:01:10.880> crawl<00:01:11.120> over<00:01:11.150> there<00:01:11.480> and<00:01:11.660> then<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.930> go<00:01:12.050> west

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
I'll live to the waterfall now once you

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.630 
I'll live to the waterfall now once you
to<00:01:16.790> the<00:01:16.880> waterfall<00:01:17.830> there's<00:01:18.830> the<00:01:19.190> stepping

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
to the waterfall there's the stepping

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.580 
to the waterfall there's the stepping
stones<00:01:19.910> on<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.180> very<00:01:20.420> top<00:01:20.720> you<00:01:21.080> can<00:01:21.320> see<00:01:21.380> right

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
stones on the very top you can see right

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.050 
stones on the very top you can see right
here<00:01:21.920> just<00:01:22.820> click<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.150> them<00:01:23.300> and<00:01:23.330> jump<00:01:23.600> over

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.060 
here just click on them and jump over

then you're going to want to walk ease
and<00:01:41.690> you<00:01:42.320> see<00:01:42.590> this<00:01:42.890> little<00:01:43.070> hole<00:01:43.280> in<00:01:43.310> the

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
and you see this little hole in the

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.460 
and you see this little hole in the
ground<00:01:43.640> right<00:01:43.910> next<00:01:44.060> to<00:01:44.210> these<00:01:44.270> people<00:01:44.470> just

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
ground right next to these people just

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:52.080 
ground right next to these people just
hop<00:01:45.710> down

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.039 

now<00:01:52.719> there<00:01:52.929> are<00:01:52.960> three<00:01:53.079> different<00:01:53.579> little

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
now there are three different little

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.349 
now there are three different little
areas<00:01:56.049> in<00:01:56.320> the<00:01:56.469> Gingka<00:01:56.950> layer<00:01:57.189> what<00:01:57.939> this<00:01:58.179> is

00:01:58.349 --> 00:01:58.359 
areas in the Gingka layer what this is

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.480 
areas in the Gingka layer what this is
first<00:01:58.659> layer<00:01:58.899> with<00:01:59.109> these<00:01:59.289> little<00:01:59.829> baby<00:02:00.130> Ginny

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
first layer with these little baby Ginny

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.719 
first layer with these little baby Ginny
goes<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:00.969> second<00:02:01.299> one<00:02:01.420> there<00:02:01.659> at<00:02:01.810> aggressive

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
goes the second one there at aggressive

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.730 
goes the second one there at aggressive
I<00:02:03.729> don't<00:02:04.659> think<00:02:04.719> you'd<00:02:04.929> want<00:02:05.140> to<00:02:05.229> do

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
I don't think you'd want to do

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.260 
I don't think you'd want to do
fire-making<00:02:06.219> there<00:02:06.490> like<00:02:06.640> as<00:02:06.759> you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.030> see<00:02:07.210> if

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
fire-making there like as you can see if

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.940 
fire-making there like as you can see if
when<00:02:07.450> I<00:02:07.479> went<00:02:07.750> through<00:02:07.899> they're<00:02:08.769> going<00:02:08.860> to

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
when I went through they're going to

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.550 
when I went through they're going to
auto<00:02:09.129> attack<00:02:09.519> me<00:02:09.759> so<00:02:10.170> that's<00:02:11.170> not<00:02:11.379> good<00:02:11.530> you

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
auto attack me so that's not good you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.630 
auto attack me so that's not good you
don't<00:02:11.680> want<00:02:11.860> that<00:02:11.950> happen<00:02:12.250> when<00:02:12.400> you're<00:02:12.549> in

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
don't want that happen when you're in

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.960 
don't want that happen when you're in
training<00:02:12.879> you<00:02:13.209> by<00:02:13.510> making<00:02:14.730> look<00:02:15.730> at<00:02:15.849> that<00:02:15.940> I

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
training you by making look at that I

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.080 
training you by making look at that I
just<00:02:16.440> all<00:02:17.440> over<00:02:17.500> me<00:02:18.010> alright<00:02:18.489> so<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.790> just<00:02:18.940> get

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
just all over me alright so you just get

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.460 
just all over me alright so you just get
to<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.360> third<00:02:19.980> third<00:02:20.980> layer<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:22.330> you<00:02:23.049> can<00:02:23.170> see

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.470 
to the third third layer as you can see

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.250 
to the third third layer as you can see
the<00:02:23.890> difference<00:02:24.400> between<00:02:24.549> the<00:02:25.000> I'm<00:02:25.989> getting<00:02:26.110> a

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
the difference between the I'm getting a

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.330 
the difference between the I'm getting a
