tutorial on a cobblestone generator this
is<00:00:06.480> pretty<00:00:06.870> much<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.259> end<00:00:07.589> of<00:00:08.069> it<00:00:08.189> and<00:00:08.429> I<00:00:08.610> have

is pretty much the end of it and I have

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.299 
is pretty much the end of it and I have
visual<00:00:09.690> steps<00:00:10.200> up<00:00:10.349> there<00:00:10.559> and<00:00:10.830> then<00:00:10.980> at<00:00:11.160> the

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
visual steps up there and then at the

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.890 
visual steps up there and then at the
end<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.730> will<00:00:11.790> make<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:14.210> pretty<00:00:15.210> fast<00:00:15.450> as<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
end I will make one pretty fast as you

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.810 
end I will make one pretty fast as you
can<00:00:15.990> see<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.560> it<00:00:16.980> works<00:00:17.190> pretty<00:00:17.400> good<00:00:17.520> this

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
can see here it works pretty good this

can see here it works pretty good this
is<00:00:17.940> my<00:00:17.970> multiplayer<00:00:19.939> cobblestone<00:00:20.939> generator

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
is my multiplayer cobblestone generator

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.939 
is my multiplayer cobblestone generator
if<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.660> don't<00:00:21.840> make<00:00:21.990> one<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.320> single-player<00:00:22.920> I

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:22.949 
if you don't make one in single-player I

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.400 
if you don't make one in single-player I
do<00:00:23.130> not<00:00:23.340> suggest<00:00:23.580> using<00:00:23.880> this<00:00:24.300> there<00:00:24.990> are<00:00:25.140> much

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
do not suggest using this there are much

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.679 
do not suggest using this there are much
better<00:00:25.650> ones<00:00:26.010> out<00:00:26.340> there<00:00:26.580> this<00:00:27.119> is<00:00:27.300> very<00:00:27.330> good

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
you hit the cobble water will push it

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.620 
you hit the cobble water will push it
down<00:00:33.660> here<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.440> you<00:00:34.770> collect<00:00:35.180> now<00:00:36.180> there's<00:00:36.540> a

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
down here and you collect now there's a

down here and you collect now there's a
really<00:00:36.989> pretty<00:00:37.140> much<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> six<00:00:37.649> step<00:00:37.829> process

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
really pretty much a six step process

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.790 
really pretty much a six step process
the<00:00:38.700> last<00:00:39.000> one<00:00:39.270> is<00:00:39.360> optional<00:00:39.540> first<00:00:40.469> one<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
the last one is optional first one is

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
the corner you want the cobble to come

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.770 
the corner you want the cobble to come
out<00:00:52.620> well<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.699> don't<00:00:54.030> that<00:00:54.360> block<00:00:54.600> and

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
out well and you don't that block and

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.790 
out well and you don't that block and
you<00:00:55.530> put<00:00:56.010> four<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.989> other<00:00:58.199> side<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.770> other

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
you put four in the other side the other

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.510 
you put four in the other side the other
corner<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.430> you<00:00:59.879> leave<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:01.309> leave<00:01:02.309> almost

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
corner and you leave the leave almost

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.090 
corner and you leave the leave almost
v-shape<00:01:03.239> open<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.409> after<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:04.920> make<00:01:05.070> a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
v-shape open and after that you make a

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.050 
v-shape open and after that you make a
second<00:01:05.640> layer<00:01:06.500> you<00:01:07.500> just<00:01:08.130> pause<00:01:08.869> during<00:01:09.869> like

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
second layer you just pause during like

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.179 
second layer you just pause during like
yeah<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> pause<00:01:12.450> if<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.990> just<00:01:13.890> want<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
yeah just pause if you just want the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.850 
yeah just pause if you just want the
visual<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.659> know<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> all<00:01:16.020> good<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.409> so

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
visual and you know it's all good and so

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.100 
visual and you know it's all good and so
you<00:01:16.920> make<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.369> second<00:01:17.759> layer<00:01:17.810> you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you make the second layer you know and

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.870 
you make the second layer you know and
pretty<00:01:19.350> much<00:01:19.530> you<00:01:19.710> skip<00:01:20.040> the<00:01:20.159> first<00:01:20.369> two<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
pretty much you skip the first two and

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
pretty much you skip the first two and
the<00:01:21.030> middle<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.390> right<00:01:21.540> there<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.350> just

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
the middle one right there and you just

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.850 
the middle one right there and you just
put<00:01:23.040> over<00:01:23.570> everything<00:01:24.570> else<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
put over everything else and this is a

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.319 
put over everything else and this is a
very<00:01:26.100> easy<00:01:26.189> step<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.670> have<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.270> can

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
very easy step and you have as you can

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.289 
very easy step and you have as you can
see<00:01:30.570> here<00:01:30.990> damn<00:01:31.470> it's<00:01:31.650> 20<00:01:32.220> million<00:01:32.400> but<00:01:33.060> as<00:01:33.210> you

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
see here damn it's 20 million but as you

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.630 
see here damn it's 20 million but as you
can<00:01:33.390> see<00:01:33.600> here<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.890> have<00:01:34.920> just<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.430> same

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
can see here you have just the same

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.069 
can see here you have just the same
thing<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.869> place<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.150> this

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
thing and you place it here and this

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.899 
thing and you place it here and this
would<00:01:40.290> be<00:01:40.439> good<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.890> water<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.520> as<00:01:41.850> you

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
would be good for the water and as you

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.760 
would be good for the water and as you
can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.150> here<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.540> just<00:01:42.570> place<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.259> water<00:01:43.470> in

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
can see here you just place the water in

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.580 
can see here you just place the water in
those<00:01:44.009> two<00:01:44.369> holes<00:01:44.610> over<00:01:45.509> there<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:45.899> then<00:01:46.560> you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
those two holes over there and then you

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.609 
those two holes over there and then you
want<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:46.920> make<00:01:47.100> another<00:01:48.350> level<00:01:49.350> and<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
want to make another level and you

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.260 
want to make another level and you
literally<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:50.159> except<00:01:50.880> for<00:01:51.060> those<00:01:51.210> two

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
literally just except for those two

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.050 
literally just except for those two
you're<00:01:52.200> gonna<00:01:52.320> just<00:01:52.560> cover<00:01:52.829> everything<00:01:53.070> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
you're gonna just cover everything and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.350 
you're gonna just cover everything and
don't<00:01:55.049> cover<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.439> middle<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.040> then<00:01:56.759> after

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
don't cover the middle and then after

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.660 
don't cover the middle and then after
that<00:01:57.509> this<00:01:57.930> is<00:01:58.110> pretty<00:01:58.380> much<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.979> then<00:01:59.310> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
that this is pretty much and then you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.090 
that this is pretty much and then you
put<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.149> lava<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:01.140> block<00:02:01.469> or<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.829> the<00:02:01.979> end

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
put the lava on this block or at the end

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.910 
put the lava on this block or at the end
over<00:02:02.159> here<00:02:03.200> what<00:02:04.200> am<00:02:04.259> i<00:02:04.320> doing<00:02:04.590> what<00:02:04.770> am<00:02:04.829> i

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
doing I can see you put the lava right

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:08.690 
doing I can see you put the lava right
here

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
here

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.809 
here
this<00:02:08.940> is<00:02:09.240> a<00:02:09.300> finished<00:02:09.840> one<00:02:10.289> but<00:02:10.800> I<00:02:11.009> prefer<00:02:11.459> this

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
this is a finished one but I prefer this

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.740 
this is a finished one but I prefer this
as<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.690> cover<00:02:12.959> up<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.200> lava<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.890> if<00:02:14.760> you<00:02:15.510> herp

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
as you cover up the lava and if you herp

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.260 
as you cover up the lava and if you herp
and<00:02:15.930> derp<00:02:16.080> like<00:02:16.290> me<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> lot<00:02:16.800> I<00:02:17.010> am<00:02:17.459> you<00:02:18.030> fall

and derp like me a lot I am you fall

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.990 
and derp like me a lot I am you fall
into<00:02:18.480> lava<00:02:18.630> a<00:02:18.810> little<00:02:19.050> bit<00:02:19.170> okay<00:02:20.160> that's<00:02:20.940> just

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
into lava a little bit okay that's just

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.760 
into lava a little bit okay that's just
a<00:02:21.120> little<00:02:21.239> bit<00:02:21.330> more<00:02:21.510> safer<00:02:21.900> as<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.530> can<00:02:22.620> see

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
a little bit more safer as you can see

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.479 
a little bit more safer as you can see
here<00:02:23.010> this<00:02:23.190> is<00:02:23.250> completely<00:02:25.190> just<00:02:26.190> like<00:02:26.310> that

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
here this is completely just like that

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.500 
here this is completely just like that
now<00:02:27.330> just<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.380> make<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:29.000> as<00:02:30.000> you<00:02:30.120> can<00:02:30.209> see<00:02:30.330> here

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
now just to make it as you can see here

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.420 
now just to make it as you can see here
I<00:02:30.540> actually<00:02:30.630> made<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.930> video<00:02:31.140> but<00:02:31.530> because

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
I actually made a video but because

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.410 
I actually made a video but because
fraps<00:02:32.819> I<00:02:33.150> totally<00:02:33.840> forgot<00:02:34.080> I<00:02:34.140> didn't<00:02:34.470> have<00:02:35.420> my

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
fraps I totally forgot I didn't have my

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.100 
fraps I totally forgot I didn't have my
speaker<00:02:37.230> on<00:02:37.410> and<00:02:38.090> not<00:02:39.090> just<00:02:39.690> over

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
speaker on and not just over

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:47.170 
speaker on and not just over
yeah<00:02:42.920> alright<00:02:43.920> five<00:02:44.160> I<00:02:45.410> thought<00:02:46.410> I<00:02:46.830> could<00:02:47.010> talk

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
yeah alright five I thought I could talk

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.800 
yeah alright five I thought I could talk
5x5<00:02:48.180> block<00:02:48.480> hit<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.470> middle<00:02:50.480> get<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.630> two

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
5x5 block hit the middle get the two

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:53.210 
5x5 block hit the middle get the two
like<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:52.019> alright<00:02:52.650> and<00:02:52.680> then<00:02:52.950> you<00:02:53.040> want<00:02:53.190> to

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
like that alright and then you want to

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.309 
like that alright and then you want to
make<00:02:53.340> another<00:02:53.610> level<00:02:56.540> is<00:02:57.540> if<00:02:57.690> it<00:02:57.810> is<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:57.959> very

00:02:58.309 --> 00:02:58.319 
make another level is if it is a very

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:04.910 
make another level is if it is a very
simple<00:03:00.140> very<00:03:01.140> simple<00:03:02.630> very<00:03:03.630> simple<00:03:03.930> a<00:03:04.230> couple

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
simple very simple very simple a couple

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.590 
simple very simple very simple a couple
of<00:03:05.010> generator<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.640> then<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:05.940> want<00:03:06.090> to<00:03:06.180> hit

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
of generator and then you want to hit

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.500 
of generator and then you want to hit
the<00:03:06.720> two<00:03:06.900> squares<00:03:07.290> of<00:03:07.470> Keener<00:03:08.150> put<00:03:09.150> the<00:03:09.269> water

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the two squares of Keener put the water

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:17.330 
the two squares of Keener put the water
in<00:03:10.970> cover<00:03:11.970> everything<00:03:13.250> but<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.959> two<00:03:16.340> over

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
simple very fast and then you had the

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.650 
simple very fast and then you had the
completed<00:03:26.459> thing<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.940> if<00:03:27.090> you<00:03:27.269> want<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
completed thing and if you want the

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.170 
completed thing and if you want the

optional step cover up the lava and you
have<00:03:33.540> your<00:03:35.930> custom<00:03:36.930> generator<00:03:37.320> now<00:03:38.190> that's

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
have your custom generator now that's

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.460 
have your custom generator now that's
pretty<00:03:38.459> much<00:03:38.579> of<00:03:38.730> that<00:03:38.850> and<00:03:39.299> hope<00:03:40.260> you<00:03:40.350> guys

little tutorial helping people out also
I<00:03:56.280> suggest<00:03:56.670> putting<00:03:57.120> this<00:03:57.299> into<00:03:57.810> a<00:03:58.470> wall<00:03:58.890> so

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
I suggest putting this into a wall so

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:02.000 
I suggest putting this into a wall so
it's<00:03:59.640> not<00:03:59.760> all<00:03:59.910> bulky<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:00.780> looks<00:04:01.709> out<00:04:01.829> but

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:02.010 
it's not all bulky and looks out but

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.550 
it's not all bulky and looks out but
it's<00:04:02.130> compact<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:02.940> if<00:04:03.840> you<00:04:03.930> put<00:04:04.109> into<00:04:04.319> a<00:04:04.350> wall

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:04.560 
it's compact and if you put into a wall

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.990 
it's compact and if you put into a wall
it's<00:04:04.859> literally<00:04:05.130> just<00:04:05.190> these<00:04:05.489> two<00:04:05.760> hanging

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
it's literally just these two hanging
