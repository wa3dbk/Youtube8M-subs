00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:32.120 
awesome I've a pair of white flip flops
that<00:03:31.170> I'm<00:03:31.260> definitely<00:03:31.440> gonna<00:03:31.650> have<00:03:31.799> to<00:03:31.889> try

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
that I'm definitely gonna have to try

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.400 
that I'm definitely gonna have to try
this<00:03:32.190> out<00:03:32.549> with<00:03:33.239> and<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.540> said<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.139> comes

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
this out with and it said that it comes

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.800 
this out with and it said that it comes
with<00:03:34.560> four<00:03:35.190> pieces<00:03:35.549> so<00:03:35.910> I'm<00:03:36.000> assuming<00:03:36.090> you<00:03:36.630> can

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
with four pieces so I'm assuming you can

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.289 
with four pieces so I'm assuming you can
do<00:03:36.930> two<00:03:37.139> pair<00:03:37.410> of<00:03:37.680> flip<00:03:38.160> flops<00:03:38.190> so<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:39.060> think

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
do two pair of flip flops so I think

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:41.330 
do two pair of flip flops so I think
good<00:03:39.599> my<00:03:39.750> niece<00:03:39.930> comes<00:03:40.200> over<00:03:40.530> later<00:03:40.799> that<00:03:41.160> I'm

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
good my niece comes over later that I'm

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.890
