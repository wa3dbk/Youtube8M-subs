00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.220
 ah 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.580
 very good to all people is the stage 

00:00:12.869 --> 00:00:16.170
 I am a mood and there is a boyfriend more 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.289
 for my channel to the people and I bring you 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.689
 all weapons filtered all the 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:24.300
 weapons confirmed by this last rival 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.429
 call of duty black ops trailer 31 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.529
 people gave me enough time to 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.660
 take all the weapons that I could 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.009
 find in the trailer so I hope 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.390
 that you like it and that you leave a good me 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.339
 like for this video because I think that 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.350
 nobody has yet made a video like that in 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:39.390
 the community extracting all the weapons 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460
 that have been seen in the trailer so 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.489
 well let's do it in this first 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.969
 image we can see how a soldier carries 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 an ak-47 here 12 or whatever you want to be but 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.809
 it's one here and then I want you to notice 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.699
 a lot on the street gun on the left 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.250
 put on the truck that seems to be 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:58.260
 a light machine gun that we suppose 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.879
 that we are going to be able to remove and why 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.559
 Suppose we're going to see guitar 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.780
 and now you are going to see it as you see here 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:06.000
 you are seeing an image of the house 74 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.369
 ak-47 as you want to call here 12 new 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.770
 of this game and now let's see the 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.140
 good image you see how it comes out 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.350
 is the one that was put in the truck 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.909
 which is the head of the turret that I put 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.590
 for example that other guards can 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:21.090
 put a turret and you can remove it 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.100
 head the turret take it with the 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 confusion to me no one suppose that 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.140
 this is going to be the same in this image 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.209
 we can see how this soldier wearing 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.240
 another soldier with himself carries a 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:33.689
 light machine gun style 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.670
 suppose it is a machine gun 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.679
 light a long weapon and who is to another 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.179
 picture we can see perfectly as yes 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.369
 which is a light machine gun that 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.009
 see how this will be better 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.289
 weapon in this image we can see how there 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.759
 a knife that is to say would also be a 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:49.200
 information that this knife does not 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.939
 We will carry predetermined as 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.590
 so far in call of duty but 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.909
 that to be able to take it we are going to have 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.890
 to equip us because if not 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:57.630
 we would have to kill two blows in 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.130
 half a knife and the truth is that 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 it's going to be quite interesting that topic 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.539
 of the knife that we will not have 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.369
 from the beginning now in this image 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:06.869
 we see as it is a weapon that I in the 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.819
 reaction trailer if you have not seen it 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.410
 you have it on the channel that says it's 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:12.510
 27 naval bull and now I realize 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.230
 that does not seem to be in any case that is 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.540
 one m16 color style 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.450
 4.4 and as seen in the weapon below 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.890
 of the water when the soul shoots is of 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.069
 bursts so it's likely that 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.980
 be a new futuristic improved model 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.840
 from the m16 now the time comes in the 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:33.060
 that trailer is excited and the 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.159
 cock and here as you can see in this 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.409
 image this weapon is me no 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.079
 we could say it is machine gun 

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.939
 light that leaves the player's hand or 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.310
 of the robot in this case because you do not know 

00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.870
 well if it is a robot or is a player of 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.519
 the truth is quite incredible the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.260
 truly incredible because I did not 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.450
 I was expecting this kind of weapons 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.400
 that come out of a limb at its own 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:55.319
 only in the trailer you can also see 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.609
 this sniper is worth seeing for very 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.750
 little time I had to be 

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.310
 stopping it several times to see if 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.810
 got a good image and this is the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.239
 best picture I've got of this 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.310
 sniper that comes out in the trailer and here 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.439
 as you can see it is like the way when 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.319
 point suppose it's the same sniper 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.670
 because it's the same area more or less and it 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.840
 they seem quite effective so it's the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.730
 there is no reason why it can be 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.950
 pretty good as I already tell you these 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:18.299
 weapons we still do not know the names nor 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:20.130
 nothing but you know who are 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.920
 confirmed because they have left 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.600
 it's because being in the game comes in the 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:26.490
 next images we can see we are 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:29.520
 seeing a couple of pistols the first one 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.590
 what looks like it is the b-23 r more 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.630
 futuristic although which is 20 third 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.880
 of black ops 2 and secondly here 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.220
 you are seeing another weapon that seems to be 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.350
 which is the same although I still do 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.480
 he caught it but I would sincerely doubt if 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.460
 It is the same because it is very similar but 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.740
 maybe they are not so good is these 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.690
 pistols that are confirmed in call of 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:50.760
 duty black ops 3 in this image as 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:52.230
 we can see you see a soldier with a 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.270
 shotgun that at the beginning I thought that 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:56.610
 It was the caixa but I realized that 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.050
 not that it's the remington r5 of the call of 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.030
 duty black ops 2 good in this game 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.220
 will be the exception as we suppose that 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.900
 will have another name and is the one that also 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:05.850
 you see a little bit later in the 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.470
 trailer that is just this that I 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.670
 I think it's going to be a very cool weapon of 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.770
 that many will make us scream 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.390
 because they kill us 300 meters away with it 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:14.490
 but well I think it's going to be a weapon 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.130
 very playable that will be pretty good 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.989
 what we say 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.900
 just a little bit later we can 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.340
 see this is soldier with this weapon that 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.410
 then how are we going to see a little more 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.020
 go ahead because it does not look good which is the 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:28.430
 boy this weapon is the chj with call of 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.500
 duty black ops' 2 and now you are going to see it 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:32.510
 on screen you see here you can see why 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.280
 just when you recharge you see him doing 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.260
 the same movement that the boy makes 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.000
 it looks like what the charger is like 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.220
 that the chj like so let's suppose that 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.710
 is the new kid of this fair game 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.990
 then this weapon comes out which is like 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.670
 we can see in the same image in the 

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:49.240
 same image we can see and verify that 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.230
 is the new executioner the truth and 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.820
 surely to many and especially 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.100
 expedite to depopulate to scream enough 

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:57.470
 because the truth is that as it is so 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:59.390
 cheap as the one of claudia comfortable go 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.490
 Cloth of kids we only have left 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:02.900
 a couple of images more than showing 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.120
 ar / bonds so let's go there in this 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:06.770
 new image we can see how the background 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.630
 the soldier in the background carries a weapon that 

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.550
 has not come out until that moment in 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.830
 the trailer that seems to be a style of 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.840
 exo rifle rifle pretty versatile 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.850
 we could say and that is more than 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.050
 near us he carries a gun that 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.310
 what you see is not the same as the 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:21.470
 earlier so we can say that it is 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.580
 a gun and here you have finally the 

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:25.099
 last one has not come out 

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.780
 the bow of explosive bullets the truth is 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:28.580
 that pretty cool something that surely 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.949
 be very versatile when playing 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:32.479
 multiplayer we hope you do not give us 

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:34.280
 so many headaches and that is 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.139
 easier to use than the crossbow of 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.699
 color and thiago in warfare and good people 

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:39.379
 this has been all the images all 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.389
 the desire that has been confirmed I hope 

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:43.219
 that we like if you liked the 

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.750
 video of this information video like this 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:46.370
 I have not seen any you'll know speaking 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.840
 about actions that have been confirmed in 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:49.400
 the trailer so I think it will be something 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.500
 novelty that you have not seen so far 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.150
 and the truth is that I would like very much 

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.830
 what management one like and I shared it six 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.629
 with all of you friends and yes 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:57.800
 guys, tomorrow you are going to have another video 

00:05:56.629 --> 00:05:59.300
 more information about colon esteban 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.889
 Suarez is going to be a little bit more 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300
 opinion rather than information because the 

00:06:00.889 --> 00:06:03.740
 information reaching other people 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.569
 but that give my point of view on that 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.490
 opinion that I am going to comment tomorrow and 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.490
 until the next kids goodbye
