this<00:00:00.960> is<00:00:01.170> unboxing<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:02.159> an<00:00:02.370> Astra<00:00:02.700> truck<00:00:04.040> TT

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
this is unboxing of an Astra truck TT

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.499 
this is unboxing of an Astra truck TT
320<00:00:05.790> x<00:00:06.029> OG<00:00:06.799> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.069> used<00:00:08.820> for<00:00:11.269> mounting<00:00:12.269> a

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
320 x OG this is used for mounting a

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.499 
320 x OG this is used for mounting a
camera<00:00:13.110> on<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.530> tripod<00:00:13.769> so<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.759> tracks<00:00:15.360> at

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
camera on a tripod so that it tracks at

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.859 
camera on a tripod so that it tracks at
the<00:00:15.570> same<00:00:15.780> rate<00:00:16.020> of<00:00:16.170> stars<00:00:17.600> appeared<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.720> move

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
the same rate of stars appeared to move

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
the same rate of stars appeared to move
in<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> sky<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:19.470> that<00:00:19.800> you<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.130> take<00:00:20.310> long

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
in the sky so that you can take long

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.560 
in the sky so that you can take long
exposures<00:00:21.270> on<00:00:21.449> stars<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:22.020> capture<00:00:22.320> more

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:23.570 
exposures on stars and capture more

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.790 
exposures on stars and capture more
photons<00:00:24.570> from<00:00:25.490> space<00:00:26.490> objects<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.420> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> a

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
photons from space objects so this is a

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.019 
photons from space objects so this is a
quick<00:00:28.980> unboxing<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.519> you<00:00:29.580> haven't<00:00:29.730> seen<00:00:29.880> any

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
quick unboxing but you haven't seen any

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.179 
quick unboxing but you haven't seen any
videos<00:00:30.300> like<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.689> far<00:00:30.900> on<00:00:30.960> YouTube<00:00:31.349> so

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
videos like this so far on YouTube so

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:40.910 
videos like this so far on YouTube so
here<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.030> have<00:00:34.130> first<00:00:35.130> slide<00:00:39.290> front<00:00:40.290> fly<00:00:40.530> first

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
here we have first slide front fly first

here we have first slide front fly first
light<00:00:41.100> optics<00:00:41.520> web<00:00:42.270> store<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.620> then<00:00:43.739> we've

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
light optics web store and then we've

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.770 
light optics web store and then we've
got<00:00:44.550> I<00:00:45.480> think<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.320> can<00:00:46.500> get<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.710> PDF<00:00:47.160> online

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:47.780 
got I think you can get this PDF online

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.529 
got I think you can get this PDF online
just<00:00:48.780> put<00:00:48.960> instructions<00:00:49.320> in<00:00:49.739> there<00:00:50.539> that

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
just put instructions in there that

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
just put instructions in there that
powering<00:00:52.020> up<00:00:52.199> how<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:54.350> synchronize<00:00:56.030> make<00:00:57.030> sure

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
powering up how to synchronize make sure

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:04.789 
powering up how to synchronize make sure
that<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:59.239> moving<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:01.609> and<00:01:03.229> back<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> notice

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
that it's moving it and back I notice

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.380 
that it's moving it and back I notice
there's<00:01:04.949> instructions<00:01:05.189> about<00:01:05.610> not<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.150> screen

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
there's instructions about not on screen

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.380 
there's instructions about not on screen
holes<00:01:06.840> like<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.040> I<00:01:08.100> hope<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.310> collimation<00:01:09.090> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
holes like so I hope that collimation is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.160 
holes like so I hope that collimation is
not<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:10.100> required<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.450> box<00:01:12.689> we<00:01:12.930> have

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
not gonna be required in the box we have

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.350 
not gonna be required in the box we have
this<00:01:13.619> is<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.830> power<00:01:14.189> pack<00:01:14.490> I<00:01:14.700> opted<00:01:15.030> that<00:01:15.270> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
this is the power pack I opted that you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300 
this is the power pack I opted that you
can<00:01:15.509> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> get<00:01:16.350> these<00:01:16.500> for<00:01:16.680> about<00:01:16.770> 2<00:01:17.040> quid

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
can you can get these for about 2 quid

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.770 
can you can get these for about 2 quid
on<00:01:17.430> ebay<00:01:17.790> but<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.659> simplicity<00:01:18.930> being<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.979> bug<00:01:20.220> I

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
on ebay but for simplicity being a bug I

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.149 
on ebay but for simplicity being a bug I
paid<00:01:21.780> I<00:01:21.900> think<00:01:22.049> an<00:01:22.110> extra<00:01:22.350> 10<00:01:22.530> pound<00:01:22.799> for<00:01:23.040> this

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
paid I think an extra 10 pound for this

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.780 
paid I think an extra 10 pound for this
but<00:01:23.400> at<00:01:23.460> least<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:23.850> wired<00:01:25.280> if<00:01:26.280> anything<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
but at least it is wired if anything is

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.960 
but at least it is wired if anything is
reluctant<00:01:27.450> Locker<00:01:27.570> robust<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.880> it's<00:01:29.880> not

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
reluctant Locker robust one it's not

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.609 
reluctant Locker robust one it's not
really<00:01:30.360> thin<00:01:30.570> plastic<00:01:30.780> so<00:01:33.500> we've<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:34.680> got

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
really thin plastic so we've also got

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.840 
really thin plastic so we've also got
slowing<00:01:37.619> things<00:01:37.770> down<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.040> bit<00:01:38.130> we've<00:01:38.340> also<00:01:38.520> got

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
slowing things down a bit we've also got

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.870 
slowing things down a bit we've also got
a<00:01:39.000> car<00:01:39.900> adapter<00:01:40.189> to<00:01:41.189> one<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.400> these<00:01:41.460> plugs<00:01:41.729> as

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
a car adapter to one of these plugs as

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.080 
a car adapter to one of these plugs as
well<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.960> also<00:01:43.380> I<00:01:43.950> think<00:01:44.159> previously<00:01:45.000> you

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
well and also I think previously you

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.889 
well and also I think previously you
might<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.360> had<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.600> all<00:01:45.659> do<00:01:45.810> these

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
might have had to all do these

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.139 
might have had to all do these
separately<00:01:46.380> here's<00:01:46.590> a<00:01:46.649> tracking<00:01:47.070> cable<00:01:47.490> to

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
separately here's a tracking cable to

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.810 
separately here's a tracking cable to
work<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.509> to<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:49.460> some<00:01:50.460> software<00:01:50.909> to<00:01:51.360> run<00:01:52.079> track

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
work up to a some software to run track

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.469 
work up to a some software to run track
it's<00:01:53.820> like<00:01:53.970> diving<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:55.110> this<00:01:55.229> pack<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:56.479> know

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
it's like diving in this pack I know

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.930 
it's like diving in this pack I know
things<00:01:57.810> one-handed<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.500> usually<00:01:59.010> in<00:01:59.580> here

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
things one-handed is usually in here

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.730 
things one-handed is usually in here
finally<00:02:00.450> got<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.659> open<00:02:00.720> and<00:02:01.200> here's<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.470> polar

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
finally got it open and here's the polar

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:11.059 
finally got it open and here's the polar
scope<00:02:04.130> homemade<00:02:09.709> yes<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:10.890> that's<00:02:10.950> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
scope homemade yes and that's the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:20.750 
scope homemade yes and that's the
magnetic<00:02:11.610> ring<00:02:11.850> there<00:02:17.630> Leedy<00:02:18.630> control<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:20.610> was

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
magnetic ring there Leedy control it was

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.250 
magnetic ring there Leedy control it was
quite<00:02:20.940> well<00:02:21.120> made<00:02:21.390> and<00:02:21.630> I<00:02:21.720> always<00:02:21.870> made<00:02:22.110> out

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
quite well made and I always made out

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.350 
quite well made and I always made out
some<00:02:22.500> sort<00:02:22.709> of<00:02:22.739> metal<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.100> something<00:02:23.360> I'm

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
some sort of metal or something I'm

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:17.330 

first<00:03:04.320> those<00:03:15.530> need<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.560> read<00:03:16.800> the<00:03:16.890> manual<00:03:16.920> I

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
first those need to read the manual I

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.710 
first those need to read the manual I
think<00:03:19.790> that's<00:03:20.790> what<00:03:20.970> it<00:03:21.060> comes<00:03:21.270> with<00:03:21.510> that's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
think that's what it comes with that's

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:28.870 
think that's what it comes with that's
how<00:03:21.930> the<00:03:21.990> gear<00:03:22.350> works<00:03:22.650> anyway<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:25.100> think<00:03:27.500> she

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
how the gear works anyway I think she

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:37.850 
how the gear works anyway I think she
Clips<00:03:29.880> inside<00:03:36.110> it<00:03:37.110> fits<00:03:37.350> nice<00:03:37.530> in<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:37.770> middle

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
Clips inside it fits nice in the middle

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:54.790 
Clips inside it fits nice in the middle
there<00:03:38.190> it<00:03:38.730> was<00:03:38.880> open<00:03:39.270> when<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.450> first<00:03:39.780> received

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:54.800 

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:57.950 

this<00:03:55.800> is<00:03:55.920> it<00:03:56.070> as<00:03:56.250> long<00:03:56.400> as<00:03:56.520> you<00:03:56.610> forearm<00:03:57.120> it<00:03:57.840> is

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:57.960 
this is it as long as you forearm it is

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:05.330 
this is it as long as you forearm it is
quite<00:03:58.260> it's<00:03:58.770> quite<00:03:59.040> big<00:04:01.850> this<00:04:02.850> is<00:04:03.030> been<00:04:03.240> a<00:04:04.340> fix

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
quite it's quite big this is been a fix

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.730 
quite it's quite big this is been a fix
on<00:04:05.460> to<00:04:05.580> the<00:04:05.670> tripod<00:04:05.970> about<00:04:06.900> here<00:04:07.200> let<00:04:07.410> us<00:04:07.440> say

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
on to the tripod about here let us say

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.650 
on to the tripod about here let us say
vol<00:04:08.430> this<00:04:08.610> weight<00:04:08.880> going<00:04:09.180> down<00:04:09.420> with

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
vol this weight going down with

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.110 
vol this weight going down with
something<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.990> few<00:04:10.280> got<00:04:11.280> play<00:04:11.460> kilograms<00:04:11.880> few

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
something a few got play kilograms few

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.690 
something a few got play kilograms few
kilograms<00:04:12.390> little<00:04:12.810> thought<00:04:13.610> but<00:04:14.610> it's

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:14.700 
kilograms little thought but it's

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.220 
kilograms little thought but it's
probably<00:04:14.850> a<00:04:14.970> lot<00:04:15.060> less<00:04:15.210> heavy<00:04:15.510> than<00:04:15.600> somebody

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
probably a lot less heavy than somebody

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.180 
probably a lot less heavy than somebody
of<00:04:16.290> the<00:04:16.350> mount<00:04:16.530> something<00:04:16.770> tried<00:04:17.040> nothing

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
of the mount something tried nothing

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.340 
of the mount something tried nothing
like<00:04:17.489> that

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:18.350 
like that

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:20.840 
like that
yeah<00:04:19.350> I<00:04:19.410> think<00:04:19.560> it<00:04:19.710> looks<00:04:19.890> pretty<00:04:20.040> good<00:04:20.549> we<00:04:20.700> get

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
yeah I think it looks pretty good we get

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.920 
yeah I think it looks pretty good we get
to<00:04:20.970> go<00:04:21.120> actually<00:04:22.610> it's<00:04:23.610> not<00:04:23.820> design<00:04:24.210> plastics

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
to go actually it's not design plastics

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:33.350 
to go actually it's not design plastics
a<00:04:24.990> bit<00:04:25.140> cheap<00:04:26.570> good<00:04:27.570> thing<00:04:31.340> it's<00:04:32.340> not<00:04:32.400> bad<00:04:32.670> it's

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
a bit cheap good thing it's not bad it's

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.810 
a bit cheap good thing it's not bad it's
been<00:04:33.510> engineered<00:04:33.750> specially<00:04:34.730> there's<00:04:35.730> a

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
been engineered specially there's a

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:46.620 
been engineered specially there's a
control<00:04:36.180> unit<00:04:36.210> there

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.890 

there's<00:04:47.200> quite<00:04:47.820> guess<00:04:48.820> that's<00:04:49.030> a<00:04:49.120> 3/8<00:04:49.510> pin

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
there's quite guess that's a 3/8 pin

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:57.540 
there's quite guess that's a 3/8 pin
their<00:04:53.490> top<00:04:54.490> it<00:04:54.640> feels<00:04:54.880> nice<00:04:55.030> or<00:04:55.270> robust<00:04:56.550> yeah

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
their top it feels nice or robust yeah

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:07.350 
their top it feels nice or robust yeah
because<00:04:58.000> all<00:04:58.240> right<00:04:58.420> it<00:04:58.990> feels<00:04:59.170> a<00:04:59.350> bit<00:04:59.380> bit<00:05:06.360> and

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
because all right it feels a bit bit and

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.300 
because all right it feels a bit bit and
I<00:05:07.450> say<00:05:07.630> the<00:05:07.720> plastic<00:05:08.170> front<00:05:08.470> the<00:05:08.710> front<00:05:09.160> and<00:05:09.280> I

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
I say the plastic front the front and I

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.660 
I say the plastic front the front and I
thought<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:09.550> would<00:05:09.610> be<00:05:09.730> a<00:05:09.760> bit<00:05:09.940> better<00:05:11.670> inside

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
thought it would be a bit better inside

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:17.780 
thought it would be a bit better inside
it<00:05:14.880> there's<00:05:15.880> a<00:05:15.940> tie<00:05:16.270> Justice<00:05:16.960> Center<00:05:17.380> there

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
it there's a tie Justice Center there

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:23.160 
it there's a tie Justice Center there
there's<00:05:18.790> a<00:05:18.910> tiny<00:05:19.440> threaded<00:05:20.440> rod<00:05:21.780> link<00:05:22.780> them<00:05:22.990> to

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.170 
there's a tiny threaded rod link them to

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.380 
there's a tiny threaded rod link them to
other<00:05:23.200> rods<00:05:23.590> on<00:05:23.770> each<00:05:23.890> side<00:05:24.250> at<00:05:24.580> all<00:05:24.760> I<00:05:25.090> did<00:05:25.240> the

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
other rods on each side at all I did the

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.670 
other rods on each side at all I did the
protective<00:05:26.370> plastic<00:05:27.370> to<00:05:27.820> sort<00:05:28.030> of<00:05:28.680> float

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
protective plastic to sort of float

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.590 
protective plastic to sort of float
around<00:05:29.710> with<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.310> front<00:05:30.550> breath<00:05:33.390> space<00:05:34.390> it'll

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
around with the front breath space it'll

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:41.060 
around with the front breath space it'll
serve<00:05:34.810> a<00:05:34.930> practical<00:05:35.170> purpose

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.220 

that's<00:05:42.070> it
