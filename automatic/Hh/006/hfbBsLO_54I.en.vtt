00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
hard line that is what it's referred to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.860 
hard line that is what it's referred to
and<00:00:47.780> that<00:00:48.780> we<00:00:49.230> shoot<00:00:49.879> someone<00:00:50.879> with<00:00:51.120> that

extra<00:00:52.350> emotional<00:00:53.360> within<00:00:54.360> them<00:00:55.430> so<00:00:59.329> when<00:01:00.329> they

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
extra emotional within them so when they

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.789 
extra emotional within them so when they
get<00:01:00.739> tied<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:02.309> something<00:01:03.559> they<00:01:04.559> get

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
get tied up with something they get

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.870 
get tied up with something they get
emotional<00:01:05.549> over<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.689> it's<00:01:07.880> very

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
emotional over it think it's very

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.469 
emotional over it think it's very
high-strung<00:01:09.770> connected<00:01:10.770> with<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.240> so<00:01:12.240> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
high-strung connected with it so this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.510 
high-strung connected with it so this
with<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.840> hard<00:01:13.080> line<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> girdle<00:01:14.400> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
with the hard line and the girdle of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.649 
with the hard line and the girdle of
Venus<00:01:16.159> the<00:01:17.159> headline<00:01:18.229> very<00:01:19.229> often<00:01:19.770> the

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:20.659 
Venus the headline very often the

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.710 
Venus the headline very often the
headline<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.960> tied<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.040> knife<00:01:23.280> line<00:01:23.720> and

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
headline is tied to the knife line and

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.510 
headline is tied to the knife line and
then<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.140> get<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> second<00:01:25.890> headline<00:01:26.490> that

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
then you get a second headline that

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.830 
then you get a second headline that
comes<00:01:27.710> slightly<00:01:28.710> from<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:30.150> when<00:01:30.600> there's

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
comes slightly from it for when there's

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.830 
comes slightly from it for when there's
true<00:01:31.380> headlines<00:01:31.950> if<00:01:32.329> there<00:01:33.329> is<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.479> bad

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
true headlines if there is a bad

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
true headlines if there is a bad
headline<00:01:34.700> on<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:36.770> the<00:01:37.770> seven<00:01:38.610> headline

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
headline on one the seven headline

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.080 
headline on one the seven headline
usually<00:01:40.079> collects<00:01:40.860> it

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
usually collects it

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.840 
usually collects it
strains<00:01:43.929> it<00:01:44.200> out<00:01:44.380> so<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.890> person<00:01:45.310> does<00:01:45.549> have

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
strains it out so the person does have

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.450 
strains it out so the person does have
that<00:01:46.479> extra<00:01:48.960> concentration<00:01:49.960> they<00:01:50.950> have<00:01:51.189> the

that extra concentration they have the

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.389 
that extra concentration they have the
ability<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.679> study<00:01:53.679> that<00:01:54.069> little<00:01:54.460> bit<00:01:54.640> extra

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
ability to study that little bit extra

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:01.139 
ability to study that little bit extra
they<00:01:57.399> probably<00:01:57.729> read<00:01:58.329> a<00:01:58.359> lot<00:01:59.429> very<00:02:00.429> connected

00:02:01.139 --> 00:02:01.149 
they probably read a lot very connected

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.139 
they probably read a lot very connected
with<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.929> tube<00:02:02.709> headlines<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:04.450> often<00:02:05.319> the

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
with the tube headlines but often the

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:13.770 
with the tube headlines but often the
one<00:02:07.149> headline<00:02:07.890> will<00:02:11.129> if<00:02:12.129> there<00:02:12.549> is<00:02:12.700> a<00:02:13.030> bad

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
one headline will if there is a bad

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.809 
one headline will if there is a bad

headline on the main headline the second

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.240 
headline on the main headline the second
one<00:02:18.970> will<00:02:19.510> show<00:02:19.840> more<00:02:20.110> or<00:02:20.230> less<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.650> practical

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
one will show more or less a practical

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.460 
one will show more or less a practical
way<00:02:21.849> of<00:02:21.880> thinking<00:02:22.599> of<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:25.569> second<00:02:26.019> headline

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
way of thinking of the second headline

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.220 
way of thinking of the second headline
in<00:02:26.829> which<00:02:27.730> is<00:02:27.940> very<00:02:28.299> rare<00:02:29.280> it<00:02:30.280> does<00:02:30.579> come<00:02:30.940> on

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
in which is very rare it does come on

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.960 
in which is very rare it does come on
occasionally<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:33.160> will<00:02:33.370> find<00:02:33.760> it

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
occasionally you will find it

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.210 
occasionally you will find it
occasionally<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.720> some<00:02:35.110> people<00:02:35.590> say<00:02:35.829> as<00:02:35.890> you

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
occasionally in some people say as you

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:41.449 
occasionally in some people say as you

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
may find it in your own a but it is

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.220 
may find it in your own a but it is
something<00:02:42.459> you<00:02:42.730> commute<00:02:43.329> if<00:02:43.629> you<00:02:43.810> do<00:02:43.989> have<00:02:44.200> it

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:44.230 
something you commute if you do have it

something you commute if you do have it
in<00:02:44.560> your<00:02:44.769> hand<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.459> you<00:02:46.269> can<00:02:46.599> put<00:02:47.049> that<00:02:47.260> extra
