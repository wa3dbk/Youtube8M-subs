00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
then the clips that hold the door sill

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.899 
then the clips that hold the door sill
in<00:01:47.210> or<00:01:48.210> are<00:01:48.329> actually<00:01:48.630> included<00:01:49.560> in<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.070> new

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
in or are actually included in the new

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.109 
in or are actually included in the new
door<00:01:51.210> sill<00:01:51.509> those<00:01:52.049> white<00:01:52.290> ones<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:53.430> I'm<00:01:53.970> going

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
door sill those white ones so I'm going

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.399 
door sill those white ones so I'm going
to<00:01:54.180> get<00:01:54.299> some<00:01:54.450> tools<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.960> we'll<00:01:55.229> get<00:01:55.350> going

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
to get some tools and we'll get going

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.649 
to get some tools and we'll get going
just<00:01:56.340> in<00:01:56.520> case<00:01:56.700> you're<00:01:56.909> working<00:01:57.090> with<00:01:57.390> a<00:01:57.420> piece

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
just in case you're working with a piece

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.630 
just in case you're working with a piece
of<00:01:57.810> trim<00:01:58.049> that<00:01:58.200> did<00:01:58.380> not<00:01:58.530> come<00:01:58.860> with<00:01:59.100> new<00:01:59.280> clips

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
of trim that did not come with new clips

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
of trim that did not come with new clips
for<00:01:59.880> your<00:02:00.030> door<00:02:00.240> sill<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.750> had<00:02:01.619> ordered<00:02:01.920> ten<00:02:02.130> of

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
for your door sill I had ordered ten of

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:03.770 
for your door sill I had ordered ten of
them<00:02:02.399> already<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.030> I<00:02:03.060> figured<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.509> would<00:02:03.540> go

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
them already so I figured I would go

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.209 
them already so I figured I would go
ahead<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.020> give<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.200> the<00:02:04.229> part<00:02:04.530> number<00:02:04.829> it's

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
ahead and give you the part number it's

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.399 
ahead and give you the part number it's
right<00:02:05.369> there<00:02:05.549> the<00:02:05.670> five<00:02:05.939> one<00:02:06.390> four<00:02:06.750> seven<00:02:06.960> one

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
right there the five one four seven one

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.390 
right there the five one four seven one
eight<00:02:07.619> four<00:02:08.009> zero<00:02:08.270> nine<00:02:09.270> six<00:02:09.770> 0/5<00:02:10.770> eight<00:02:11.069> it's

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
eight four zero nine six 0/5 eight it's

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.740 
eight four zero nine six 0/5 eight it's
the<00:02:11.489> part<00:02:11.670> number<00:02:11.910> for<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.209> think<00:02:12.360> I<00:02:12.540> paid

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
the part number for that I think I paid

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.090 
the part number for that I think I paid
like<00:02:12.900> four<00:02:13.230> dollars

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
like four dollars

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.680 
like four dollars
so<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> suppose<00:02:14.730> I'll<00:02:14.880> keep<00:02:15.030> them<00:02:15.180> on<00:02:15.300> hand<00:02:15.330> in

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
so I suppose I'll keep them on hand in

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.900 
so I suppose I'll keep them on hand in
case<00:02:15.900> any<00:02:16.170> break<00:02:16.440> in<00:02:16.650> the<00:02:16.770> future<00:02:17.100> our<00:02:17.340> first

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
case any break in the future our first

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.210 
case any break in the future our first
step<00:02:18.150> of<00:02:18.360> replacing<00:02:18.960> the<00:02:19.140> door<00:02:19.620> so<00:02:19.890> here<00:02:20.100> is

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
step of replacing the door so here is

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.730 
step of replacing the door so here is
going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> be<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.610> pull<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.320> trim<00:02:22.320> clip<00:02:22.590> and

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
going to be to pull up the trim clip and

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.020 
going to be to pull up the trim clip and
I<00:02:22.770> actually<00:02:22.860> did<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.310> in<00:02:23.370> a<00:02:23.550> video<00:02:23.790> before

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
I actually did this in a video before

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.380 
I actually did this in a video before
when<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> replace<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.440> door<00:02:26.040> gasket<00:02:26.580> here<00:02:26.760> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
when I replace this door gasket here so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.610 
when I replace this door gasket here so
now<00:02:27.570> that<00:02:27.630> it's<00:02:27.870> freezing<00:02:28.260> it's<00:02:28.380> going<00:02:28.560> to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
now that it's freezing it's going to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.980 
now that it's freezing it's going to
kill<00:02:28.800> my<00:02:28.920> hands<00:02:29.190> even<00:02:29.400> more<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:30.660> can<00:02:30.810> kind

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
kill my hands even more but you can kind

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.050 
kill my hands even more but you can kind
of<00:02:31.050> feel<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:31.500> lip<00:02:31.800> on<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.370> far<00:02:32.580> side<00:02:32.850> of<00:02:32.880> it

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
of feel this lip on the far side of it

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.820 
of feel this lip on the far side of it
here<00:02:33.210> you<00:02:33.270> want<00:02:33.570> to<00:02:33.660> get<00:02:33.810> hands<00:02:34.260> under<00:02:34.650> there

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
here you want to get hands under there

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.230 
here you want to get hands under there
as<00:02:34.980> much<00:02:35.100> as<00:02:35.280> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.550> and<00:02:35.820> then<00:02:35.910> pull

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
as much as you can and then pull

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.420 
as much as you can and then pull
straight<00:02:36.780> up<00:02:36.810> towards<00:02:37.380> you<00:02:37.530> pretty<00:02:38.160> hard

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
straight up towards you pretty hard

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.160 
straight up towards you pretty hard
don't<00:02:39.000> worry<00:02:39.180> you're<00:02:39.450> not<00:02:39.540> going<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.810> break<00:02:39.960> it

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
don't worry you're not going to break it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.140 
don't worry you're not going to break it
here<00:02:40.530> is<00:02:40.650> our<00:02:40.830> old<00:02:41.010> piece<00:02:41.310> so<00:02:41.640> it<00:02:41.700> pulls<00:02:41.940> right

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
here is our old piece so it pulls right

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.520 
here is our old piece so it pulls right
up<00:02:42.210> there's<00:02:42.570> three<00:02:42.870> clips<00:02:43.140> you're<00:02:43.350> going<00:02:43.470> to

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
up there's three clips you're going to

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:44.930 
up there's three clips you're going to
have<00:02:43.620> to<00:02:43.770> align<00:02:44.040> them<00:02:44.190> on<00:02:44.310> your<00:02:44.460> new<00:02:44.580> one<00:02:44.730> just

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
have to align them on your new one just

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.520 
have to align them on your new one just
by<00:02:45.360> sliding<00:02:45.630> them<00:02:45.870> around<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.320> make<00:02:46.500> sure

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
by sliding them around so make sure

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.840 
by sliding them around so make sure
they're<00:02:46.770> all<00:02:46.890> on<00:02:46.920> the<00:02:47.130> right<00:02:47.280> holes<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.760> then

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
they're all on the right holes and then

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.820 
they're all on the right holes and then
we'll<00:02:47.940> just<00:02:48.180> jab<00:02:48.390> that<00:02:48.570> back<00:02:48.810> down<00:02:49.020> in<00:02:49.260> that'll

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
we'll just jab that back down in that'll

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.160 
we'll just jab that back down in that'll
be<00:02:49.950> our<00:02:50.070> last<00:02:50.310> step<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:51.480> now<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:51.750> one<00:02:51.930> isn't

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
be our last step for now this one isn't

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:55.160 
be our last step for now this one isn't
even<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:52.470> that<00:02:52.650> bad<00:02:52.890> of<00:02:53.040> shape<00:02:53.900> but<00:02:54.900> while<00:02:55.050> I'm

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
even in that bad of shape but while I'm

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.690 
even in that bad of shape but while I'm
doing<00:02:55.380> this<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.620> figured<00:02:55.890> I'd<00:02:55.980> replace<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.490> like

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
doing this I figured I'd replace it like

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.330 
doing this I figured I'd replace it like
a<00:02:56.730> seventeen<00:02:57.270> dollar<00:02:57.480> part<00:02:58.130> so<00:02:59.130> now<00:02:59.220> we're

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
a seventeen dollar part so now we're

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:00.530 
a seventeen dollar part so now we're
going<00:02:59.430> to<00:02:59.520> come<00:02:59.670> down<00:02:59.820> here<00:03:00.060> there's<00:03:00.300> no<00:03:00.510> need

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
going to come down here there's no need

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.780 
going to come down here there's no need
to<00:03:00.720> remove<00:03:01.140> our<00:03:01.380> sealed<00:03:01.890> gasket<00:03:02.370> to<00:03:02.520> get<00:03:02.640> this

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
to remove our sealed gasket to get this

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.180 
to remove our sealed gasket to get this
thing<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.240> if<00:03:03.990> you<00:03:04.110> have<00:03:04.320> broken<00:03:04.650> clips<00:03:05.010> on

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
thing out if you have broken clips on

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.670 
thing out if you have broken clips on
these<00:03:05.370> it's<00:03:05.580> actually<00:03:05.970> easier<00:03:06.360> if<00:03:07.200> you<00:03:07.350> don't

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
these it's actually easier if you don't

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.150 
these it's actually easier if you don't
just<00:03:08.100> start<00:03:08.310> prying<00:03:08.790> away<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.210> one<00:03:09.480> side<00:03:10.160> you

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
just start prying away on one side you

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.370 
just start prying away on one side you
know<00:03:11.250> we're<00:03:11.400> going<00:03:11.490> to<00:03:11.550> replace<00:03:11.850> it<00:03:11.970> so<00:03:12.390> really

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:13.380 
know we're going to replace it so really

we<00:03:51.209> line<00:03:52.050> those<00:03:52.290> up<00:03:52.320> in<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:52.740> holes<00:03:52.920> and<00:03:53.430> then

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:53.550 
we line those up in the holes and then

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.240 
we line those up in the holes and then
just<00:03:53.790> smack<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.390> down<00:03:54.420> into<00:03:54.750> place<00:03:54.990> so<00:03:55.860> I'm

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
just smack it down into place so I'm

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:57.470 
just smack it down into place so I'm
going<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.520> get<00:03:56.610> down<00:03:56.760> in<00:03:56.910> an<00:03:57.000> awkward<00:03:57.360> angle

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
going to get down in an awkward angle

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:58.970 
going to get down in an awkward angle
make<00:03:57.840> sure<00:03:57.990> those<00:03:58.170> are<00:03:58.290> lined<00:03:58.470> up<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.770> I<00:03:58.830> don't

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
make sure those are lined up so I don't

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.890 
make sure those are lined up so I don't
break<00:03:59.100> them<00:03:59.280> off<00:03:59.430> and<00:03:59.700> then<00:04:00.240> bash<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.750> into

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
break them off and then bash it into

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.260 
break them off and then bash it into
place<00:04:01.080> okay<00:04:01.620> ten<00:04:01.980> seconds<00:04:02.430> of<00:04:02.550> bashing<00:04:03.030> later

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:03.270 
place okay ten seconds of bashing later

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.870 
place okay ten seconds of bashing later

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:38.780 
the sill they're the strip weren't
fitting<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.890> was<00:04:38.040> trying<00:04:38.250> to<00:04:38.340> go<00:04:38.460> in<00:04:38.580> at<00:04:38.670> an

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
fitting it was trying to go in at an

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:40.130 
fitting it was trying to go in at an
angle<00:04:38.880> they<00:04:39.180> didn't<00:04:39.390> want<00:04:39.510> to<00:04:39.540> go<00:04:39.660> straight<00:04:39.960> in

angle they didn't want to go straight in

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.020 
angle they didn't want to go straight in
so<00:04:40.320> I<00:04:40.380> pulled<00:04:40.740> the<00:04:40.830> clips<00:04:41.160> off<00:04:41.340> the<00:04:41.550> old<00:04:41.700> piece

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.030 
so I pulled the clips off the old piece

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.160 
so I pulled the clips off the old piece
and<00:04:42.360> then<00:04:43.340> whacked<00:04:44.340> it<00:04:44.520> in<00:04:44.670> and<00:04:44.910> now<00:04:45.810> it<00:04:45.930> fits

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:46.170 
and then whacked it in and now it fits

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.160 
and then whacked it in and now it fits
right<00:04:46.380> so<00:04:46.740> check<00:04:47.460> reel<00:04:48.030> OEM<00:04:48.360> for<00:04:48.600> part<00:04:48.810> numbers

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:49.170 
right so check reel OEM for part numbers

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:50.870 
right so check reel OEM for part numbers
or<00:04:49.530> you<00:04:49.560> may<00:04:49.800> be<00:04:49.860> able<00:04:50.010> to<00:04:50.130> get<00:04:50.280> those<00:04:50.430> work<00:04:50.700> to
