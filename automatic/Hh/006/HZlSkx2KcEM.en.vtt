Everton face Villa who didn't look great
against<00:01:59.820> Tottenham<00:02:00.030> last<00:02:00.179> weekend<00:02:00.539> and<00:02:00.960> I<00:02:01.320> can

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
against Tottenham last weekend and I can

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.230 
against Tottenham last weekend and I can
definitely<00:02:01.649> see<00:02:02.160> Lukaku<00:02:02.670> being<00:02:02.940> very

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
definitely see Lukaku being very

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.779 
definitely see Lukaku being very
involved<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.960> game<00:02:04.170> he<00:02:04.410> scored<00:02:05.340> four

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
involved in that game he scored four

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.130

goals<00:02:05.819> out<00:02:06.330> of<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.509> four<00:02:06.720> games<00:02:06.960> he's

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
featured in so far for Everton so I

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.720 
featured in so far for Everton so I
still<00:02:09.509> think<00:02:09.690> he's<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> great<00:02:10.110> option<00:02:10.319> uh<00:02:10.730> he

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
still think he's a great option uh he

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.690 
still think he's a great option uh he
should<00:02:11.970> do<00:02:12.150> well<00:02:12.300> this<00:02:12.420> week<00:02:13.490> finally<00:02:14.490> I'm

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
chance for me though if he doesn't get

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:25.710 
chance for me though if he doesn't get
an<00:03:22.120> assist<00:03:22.450> or<00:03:22.630> a<00:03:22.690> goal<00:03:22.900> this<00:03:23.049> week<00:03:24.239> I<00:03:25.239> was

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.170 
know means nothing in FP el but it was
him<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.650> played<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> three<00:03:33.370> ball<00:03:33.610> that<00:03:33.910> led

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
him that played the three ball that led

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.330 
him that played the three ball that led
tonight's<00:03:34.540> first<00:03:34.780> goal<00:03:35.080> and<00:03:35.260> he<00:03:35.769> also<00:03:35.950> hit<00:03:36.250> the

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
tonight's first goal and he also hit the

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.100 
tonight's first goal and he also hit the
crossbar<00:03:36.519> and<00:03:36.970> a<00:03:37.390> lot<00:03:37.569> of<00:03:37.599> the<00:03:37.720> attacks<00:03:37.989> came

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
crossbar and a lot of the attacks came

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.259 
crossbar and a lot of the attacks came
through<00:03:38.500> him<00:03:38.680> so<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> am<00:03:39.519> considering<00:03:39.910> playing

00:03:40.259 --> 00:03:40.269 
through him so I am considering playing

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.080 
through him so I am considering playing
him<00:03:40.540> over<00:03:40.900> Barclay<00:03:41.640> there's<00:03:42.640> been<00:03:42.880> some

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 
him over Barclay there's been some

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.330 
him over Barclay there's been some
quotes<00:03:43.390> from<00:03:43.540> Martinez<00:03:44.260> that<00:03:45.040> kind<00:03:45.280> of

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
quotes from Martinez that kind of

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.890 
quotes from Martinez that kind of
suggests<00:03:45.760> he's<00:03:46.000> considering<00:03:46.510> rest<00:03:46.720> in

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
suggests he's considering rest in

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.809 
suggests he's considering rest in
Barclay<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.890> that's<00:03:48.069> another<00:03:48.310> factor<00:03:48.549> i'm

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
Barclay so that's another factor i'm

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:51.180 
Barclay so that's another factor i'm
considering<00:03:49.299> i<00:03:49.540> can't<00:03:50.349> see<00:03:50.560> Everton<00:03:50.769> keeping

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
considering i can't see Everton keeping

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.440 
considering i can't see Everton keeping
a<00:03:51.220> clean<00:03:51.370> sheet<00:03:51.430> there<00:03:51.820> really<00:03:52.090> especially

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:52.450 
a clean sheet there really especially

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.930 
a clean sheet there really especially
not<00:03:52.840> with<00:03:52.959> benteke<00:03:53.500> back<00:03:53.680> and<00:03:54.310> I<00:03:54.400> don't<00:03:54.670> think

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:54.940 
not with benteke back and I don't think

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:56.460 
not with benteke back and I don't think
it's<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.269> good<00:03:55.299> idea<00:03:55.480> to<00:03:55.660> play<00:03:55.900> for<00:03:55.959> at<00:03:56.230> the<00:03:56.290> back

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:56.470 
it's a good idea to play for at the back

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:59.099 
it's a good idea to play for at the back
so<00:03:56.859> at<00:03:57.160> the<00:03:57.340> moment<00:03:57.549> it's<00:03:58.390> looking<00:03:58.750> like<00:03:58.900> being

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
so at the moment it's looking like being

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:00.990 
so at the moment it's looking like being
between<00:03:59.320> Yanez<00:03:59.769> I<00:03:59.920> and<00:04:00.190> Barclay<00:04:00.760> for<00:04:00.910> the

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
between Yanez I and Barclay for the

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.080 
between Yanez I and Barclay for the
final<00:04:01.359> places<00:04:01.690> in<00:04:01.750> my<00:04:01.870> team<00:04:02.549> I'm<00:04:03.549> going<00:04:03.850> to<00:04:03.910> try

off its that I can get them at cheap
prices<00:04:47.639> both<00:04:48.639> are<00:04:48.880> likely<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.210> drop<00:04:49.450> again

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
prices both are likely to drop again

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:51.450 
prices both are likely to drop again
soon<00:04:50.080> so<00:04:50.470> providing<00:04:51.010> they<00:04:51.100> aren't<00:04:51.280> going<00:04:51.400> to

Rooney<00:05:00.000> has<00:05:00.180> been<00:05:00.360> playing<00:05:00.570> well<00:05:00.750> I<00:05:00.960> can<00:05:01.290> seem

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
Rooney has been playing well I can seem

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:02.930 
Rooney has been playing well I can seem
getting<00:05:01.710> a<00:05:01.770> goal<00:05:01.949> but<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.310> just<00:05:02.520> don't<00:05:02.790> trust

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
getting a goal but I just don't trust

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.570 
getting a goal but I just don't trust
United<00:05:03.360> at<00:05:03.449> the<00:05:03.540> moment<00:05:03.870> and<00:05:03.960> giroux<00:05:04.889> plays<00:05:05.310> in

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580

the early kick-off game so even though
it<00:05:07.380> should<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.830> an<00:05:07.919> easy<00:05:08.010> game<00:05:08.160> against

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
it should be an easy game against

it should be an easy game against
