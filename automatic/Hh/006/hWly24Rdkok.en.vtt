this bad boy is going to find it so

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.069 
this bad boy is going to find it so
basically<00:00:49.560> there's<00:00:50.310> three<00:00:50.520> differs<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.840> teen

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
basically there's three differs a teen

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
basically there's three differs a teen
or<00:00:52.260> seventeen<00:00:52.770> different<00:00:53.070> versions<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> this

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
or seventeen different versions of this

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.920 
or seventeen different versions of this
student<00:00:53.970> they<00:00:54.030> can<00:00:54.059> actually<00:00:54.480> choose<00:00:54.690> from

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
student they can actually choose from

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.479 
student they can actually choose from
those<00:00:55.230> differences<00:00:55.590> will<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.950> your

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
those differences will be your

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.660 
those differences will be your
resolution<00:00:57.090> your<00:00:58.079> lens<00:00:58.320> magnification<00:00:58.950> and

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
resolution your lens magnification and

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.260 
resolution your lens magnification and
your<00:01:00.239> frame<00:01:00.930> rate<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.760> basically<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.120> two

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
your frame rate so basically the two

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
your frame rate so basically the two
different<00:01:03.600> resolutions<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.350> we<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.680> be

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
different resolutions that we will be

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.120 
different resolutions that we will be
talking<00:01:05.009> about<00:01:05.250> are<00:01:05.550> 320<00:01:06.060> by<00:01:06.180> 480<00:01:06.950> which<00:01:07.950> is

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
talking about are 320 by 480 which is

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.680 
talking about are 320 by 480 which is
your<00:01:08.250> base<00:01:08.399> model<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.210> then<00:01:09.330> you<00:01:09.450> have<00:01:09.540> before

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:09.690 
your base model and then you have before

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.450 
your base model and then you have before
you<00:01:10.050> get<00:01:10.140> by<00:01:10.229> 640<00:01:10.800> which<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.130> bit<00:01:11.310> higher

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
you get by 640 which is a bit higher

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.950 
you get by 640 which is a bit higher
resolution<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.270> you're<00:01:12.450> going<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.780> a

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
resolution and you're going to have a

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.600 
resolution and you're going to have a
lot<00:01:13.140> more<00:01:13.320> clarity<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.740> definition<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.460> the

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
lot more clarity and definition in the

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.950 
lot more clarity and definition in the
picture

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
picture

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
picture
next<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.490> your<00:01:17.820> lens

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
next the you have your lens

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.719 
next the you have your lens
magnification<00:01:18.299> yeah<00:01:18.900> with<00:01:19.049> 3<00:01:19.290> X<00:01:19.409> 5<00:01:19.830> X<00:01:20.070> 8<00:01:20.280> X<00:01:20.520> +<00:01:20.640> 9

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
magnification yeah with 3 X 5 X 8 X + 9

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.070

X<00:01:21.860> lens<00:01:22.860> to<00:01:23.159> choose<00:01:23.369> from<00:01:23.610> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.780> we<00:01:24.930> move

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
X lens to choose from and then we move

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.930 
X lens to choose from and then we move
on<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.290> frame<00:01:25.560> right<00:01:25.770> frame<00:01:26.100> rate<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.640> 30

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940 
on to frame right frame rate you have 30

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.660 
on to frame right frame rate you have 30
Hertz<00:01:27.150> and<00:01:27.390> 60<00:01:27.750> Hertz<00:01:27.900> to<00:01:28.049> choose<00:01:28.229> from<00:01:28.439> now<00:01:29.100> 30

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
Hertz and 60 Hertz to choose from now 30

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.850 
Hertz and 60 Hertz to choose from now 30
Hertz<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:30.659> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:30.990> basically<00:01:31.350> 30<00:01:31.619> frames

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
Hertz is going to be basically 30 frames

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.620 
Hertz is going to be basically 30 frames
per<00:01:31.979> second<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.520> 60<00:01:33.000> is<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.270> be<00:01:33.330> 60

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
per second and 60 is going to be 60

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.510 
per second and 60 is going to be 60
frames<00:01:33.810> per<00:01:33.900> second<00:01:34.350> another<00:01:34.979> really<00:01:35.369> good

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
frames per second another really good

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.219 
frames per second another really good
reason<00:01:35.580> why<00:01:35.970> I<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.510> this<00:01:36.720> unit<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.170> here

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
reason why I like this unit right here

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.060 
reason why I like this unit right here
is<00:01:37.470> because<00:01:37.979> of<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.130> battery<00:01:38.400> compartment<00:01:39.049> so

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
is because of the battery compartment so

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:45.859 
is because of the battery compartment so
take<00:01:41.070> a<00:01:41.100> look<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:44.450> so<00:01:45.450> this<00:01:45.659> is<00:01:45.810> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
take a look at this so this is the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.210 
take a look at this so this is the
battery<00:01:46.140> compartment<00:01:46.409> right<00:01:46.650> here<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:47.009> takes

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
battery compartment right here it takes

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.850 
battery compartment right here it takes
three<00:01:47.549> cr123<00:01:48.210> batteries<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:48.869> trust<00:01:49.560> me<00:01:49.710> don't

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
three cr123 batteries and trust me don't

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.260 
three cr123 batteries and trust me don't
worry<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> know<00:01:50.220> these<00:01:50.610> batteries<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.030> very

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
worry I know these batteries are very

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.609 
worry I know these batteries are very
expensive<00:01:51.509> but<00:01:51.960> they'll<00:01:52.140> last<00:01:52.320> you<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.560> really

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
expensive but they'll last you a really

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.160 
expensive but they'll last you a really
long<00:01:52.890> time<00:01:53.280> especially<00:01:53.610> three<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.150> them<00:01:54.240> so

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
long time especially three of them so

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.859 
long time especially three of them so
this<00:01:55.979> is<00:01:56.100> like<00:01:56.220> a<00:01:56.250> revolver<00:01:56.790> style<00:01:57.150> chamber

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
this is like a revolver style chamber

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.230 
this is like a revolver style chamber
that<00:01:58.049> actually<00:01:58.380> matters<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:59.009> to<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.400> take

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
that actually matters going to and take

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.179 
that actually matters going to and take
a<00:02:00.270> look<00:02:00.450> right<00:02:00.600> here<00:02:00.659> this<00:02:01.650> is<00:02:01.710> your<00:02:01.829> eye<00:02:01.979> peas

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
a look right here this is your eye peas

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.080 
a look right here this is your eye peas
right<00:02:02.340> here<00:02:02.549> and<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.790> is<00:02:02.909> your<00:02:03.000> objective

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
right here and this is your objective

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.420 
right here and this is your objective
lens<00:02:03.630> and<00:02:03.930> there's<00:02:04.229> actually<00:02:04.650> you<00:02:05.040> know<00:02:05.100> oh<00:02:05.340> my

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
lens and there's actually you know oh my

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:06.740 
lens and there's actually you know oh my
god<00:02:05.610> put<00:02:06.000> my<00:02:06.090> finger<00:02:06.329> through<00:02:06.360> there<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
god put my finger through there so

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.030 
god put my finger through there so
basically<00:02:06.960> how<00:02:07.350> it<00:02:07.470> works<00:02:07.500> is<00:02:07.799> there's<00:02:07.979> a

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:08.040 
basically how it works is there's a

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.070 
basically how it works is there's a
camera<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.459> this<00:02:08.700> side<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.209> intakes<00:02:10.049> the

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
camera on this side that intakes the

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.890 
camera on this side that intakes the
the<00:02:11.740> information<00:02:12.250> the<00:02:12.610> heat<00:02:12.850> and<00:02:13.120> then

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900 
the information the heat and then

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.690 
the information the heat and then
there's<00:02:14.260> a<00:02:14.320> visible<00:02:14.740> screen<00:02:15.190> on<00:02:15.310> this<00:02:15.460> side

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
there's a visible screen on this side

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.220 
there's a visible screen on this side
that<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.030> look<00:02:16.180> into<00:02:16.330> your<00:02:16.630> eyepiece

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
that you look into your eyepiece

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.200 
that you look into your eyepiece
so<00:02:17.620> there's<00:02:17.800> actually<00:02:18.160> the<00:02:18.580> technology<00:02:18.880> that

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
so there's actually the technology that

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:21.030 
so there's actually the technology that
is<00:02:19.330> used<00:02:19.360> with<00:02:19.840> this<00:02:20.140> units<00:02:20.500> actually<00:02:20.830> really

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
is used with this units actually really

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.240 
is used with this units actually really
crazy<00:02:21.280> in<00:02:21.520> my<00:02:21.550> opinion<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.560> another

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
crazy in my opinion and and another

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.030 
crazy in my opinion and and another
really<00:02:24.490> cool<00:02:24.730> fact<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.240> that<00:02:25.450> this<00:02:25.780> unit<00:02:26.620> will

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
really cool fact is that this unit will

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.710 
really cool fact is that this unit will
work<00:02:27.250> not<00:02:27.640> as<00:02:27.760> long<00:02:27.940> as<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.240> was<00:02:28.510> there<00:02:28.630> were

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
work not as long as it was there were

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.060 
work not as long as it was there were
three<00:02:28.870> batteries<00:02:29.230> but<00:02:29.440> it<00:02:29.530> will<00:02:29.590> work<00:02:29.740> on<00:02:29.920> one

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
three batteries but it will work on one

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:33.540 
three batteries but it will work on one
battery<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.640> if<00:02:30.760> you<00:02:32.040> see<00:02:33.040> fan<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.310> there<00:02:33.460> it

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
battery so if you see fan in there it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.180 
battery so if you see fan in there it
will<00:02:33.760> work<00:02:34.200> for<00:02:35.200> a<00:02:35.260> bit<00:02:35.530> less<00:02:35.710> of<00:02:35.740> time<00:02:36.040> of

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
will work for a bit less of time of

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.130 
will work for a bit less of time of
course<00:02:36.280> but<00:02:36.760> it'll<00:02:36.910> still<00:02:37.090> work<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:37.570> it's

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
course but it'll still work so it's

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.720 
course but it'll still work so it's
really<00:02:38.380> nice<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:38.620> know<00:02:38.860> any<00:02:39.130> on<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.520> field

here's<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.250> battery<00:02:57.430> compartment<00:02:57.820> right

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
here's the battery compartment right

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.890 
here's the battery compartment right
here<00:02:58.180> you<00:02:58.660> get<00:02:58.780> a<00:02:58.840> bit<00:02:59.560> of<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.710> close-up<00:02:59.920> on<00:03:00.220> it

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
here you get a bit of a close-up on it

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.520 
here you get a bit of a close-up on it
so<00:03:01.900> you<00:03:01.990> open<00:03:02.230> up<00:03:02.320> the<00:03:02.830> revolver<00:03:03.190> style<00:03:03.850> rate<00:03:04.090> a

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
so you open up the revolver style rate a

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:07.470 
so you open up the revolver style rate a
chamber<00:03:05.530> for<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:05.680> batteries<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:07.180> then<00:03:07.390> you

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
chamber for the batteries and then you

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.000 
chamber for the batteries and then you
got<00:03:07.630> you<00:03:07.810> take<00:03:08.020> a<00:03:08.050> look<00:03:08.260> at<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.470> inside<00:03:08.740> of<00:03:08.920> it

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
got you take a look at the inside of it

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.100 
got you take a look at the inside of it
and<00:03:10.620> then<00:03:11.620> after<00:03:12.370> that<00:03:12.550> we<00:03:13.150> have<00:03:13.420> your<00:03:13.690> diopter

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
and then after that we have your diopter

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:15.960 
and then after that we have your diopter
adjustment<00:03:14.170> right<00:03:14.560> here<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.250> have<00:03:15.430> all

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
adjustment right here so you have all

adjustment right here so you have all
your<00:03:16.000> adjustments<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:16.840> here<00:03:17.110> so<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.470> goes

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
your adjustments right here so it goes

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.060 
your adjustments right here so it goes
for<00:03:18.550> whatever<00:03:18.730> you<00:03:19.240> would<00:03:19.420> need<00:03:19.830> for<00:03:20.830> your

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
for whatever you would need for your

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:24.960 
for whatever you would need for your
demand<00:03:22.060> and<00:03:22.300> then<00:03:22.630> we<00:03:22.930> have<00:03:23.140> a<00:03:23.410> dovetail<00:03:24.280> mount

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
demand and then we have a dovetail mount

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.190 
demand and then we have a dovetail mount
on<00:03:25.210> this<00:03:25.480> side<00:03:25.770> also<00:03:26.770> made<00:03:27.070> by<00:03:27.190> arms<00:03:28.050> on<00:03:29.050> the

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
on this side also made by arms on the

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.690 
on this side also made by arms on the
front<00:03:29.410> we<00:03:29.530> have<00:03:29.560> our<00:03:29.770> front<00:03:29.980> focus<00:03:30.430> right<00:03:30.670> here

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 
front we have our front focus right here

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.310 
front we have our front focus right here
so<00:03:31.060> you<00:03:31.150> would<00:03:31.300> be<00:03:31.450> able<00:03:31.510> to<00:03:31.690> focus<00:03:31.840> your<00:03:32.080> unit

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
so you would be able to focus your unit

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.770 
so you would be able to focus your unit
in<00:03:32.470> the<00:03:32.560> front<00:03:32.800> as<00:03:33.700> opposed<00:03:34.060> to<00:03:34.150> your<00:03:34.300> diopter

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
in the front as opposed to your diopter

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.870 
in the front as opposed to your diopter
adjustment<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.470> then<00:03:36.010> right<00:03:36.160> here<00:03:36.190> here's

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
adjustment and then right here here's

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.760
