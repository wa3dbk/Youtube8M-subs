00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.270
 third episode of league of legends cool 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.700
 after in the last episode the 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.349
 Abbreviation terms have been resolved 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.450
 Let's go to the lanes today 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.160
 roll distribution first we start 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.199
 to discuss the role distribution 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.390
 this usually looks like this 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.300
 First of all there is the supporter 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.340
 early game supports the guitar and 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.859
 in late game the team each around his 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.420
 items but also with his box then there 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 it still the tank of the opposite to the 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.970
 Hurt a lot of damage to other champions 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.969
 can endure 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.980
 In addition, there are the ones whose task 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.230
 it is the two careys off 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.170
 at the careys there is once the ap and 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.820
 once the adp these hot careys there 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.379
 harm them with their big late game 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.469
 helping her team to win 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.670
 we know there are the three or 4 lanes 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.050
 the top and lane with lane and lane 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.940
 the jungle when you call him lame 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.410
 could now consider one 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.190
 lineup look like this 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.379
 in the middle of the ap carey on the top 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.480
 Lady in the jungle of the slope and up 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.000
 the bot lane actually almost 100 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.470
 percent of the supporter and the eddy curry 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.990
 But this setup does not have to be 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.790
 it may as well be the one fishing the one 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.409
 and the tank will be on the top line 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.330
 in another lineup it can 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.119
 just as well be that the ap carey 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.650
 jungle and adedy in the middle is thus 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:22.350
 we actually always have three solo 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.630
 lanes and a double layer now to 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.430
 explanation why that is the edi carey 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.799
 is very weak, especially in the early game 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.750
 because he is extremely easy to think 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.210
 put him a supporter to the side 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.680
 with the idea of kerry and the supporter 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.479
 But not so much experience 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.400
 like the champions on the top and in the 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.590
 but this is not so bad 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.850
 because for the lg carey are on the part of a lot 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.009
 more important than his level 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.960
 this is different with medi and the rp 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.100
 carey because their damage scale yes 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.960
 with your skills 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.030
 speak the higher the level the more 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.460
 harm only a few examples for the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.070
 different lanes in the jungle could 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.439
 many ivana mumok tours warwick shanley 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.810
 are or just play a lot of sticks around 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.540
 to name a few or on the top lane 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.880
 asus yorkey react to gameplay or 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.710
 Darius, however, is to be noted that many 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.690
 Chips in the jungle are good too 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.190
 the top line are good for example or 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.170
 gameplay or nasus 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.420
 thus, many ghana can 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.069
 on the toplink and be too 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.620
 many top lena in the jungle are good 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:23.010
 Examples for with jepsen eg cassidy 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:26.040
 Waltz or popular carey are for 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:28.380
 example wayne race was israel miss 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.810
 fortune or kate the associated ones 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.569
 supporter can be son azzurra katari 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.130
 lightning sick or leona i hope i 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.540
 could you roll distribution on the 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.010
 bring lanes closer 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.440
 that was already the last video in 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.000
 that we talk about fundamentals because off 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.280
 the next video is the focus more 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.959
 put on tactics not just yours 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 normal game but to improve 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:50.040
 maybe also to improve your games 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.860
 So we discuss in the next video 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.239
 the teams account for 70 percent of the games 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.400
 are lost because it is a wrong one 

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:58.560
 positions or wrong or even 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.000
 not engaged would end up 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.769
 I'm looking forward to a review 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.940
 and if you support this channel 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.769

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.090
 dallas that's what it was from me 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:10.100

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.100
