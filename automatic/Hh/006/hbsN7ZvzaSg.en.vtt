00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
characters this sounds kind of silly at

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.800 
characters this sounds kind of silly at
first<00:01:06.630> but<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:06.990> think<00:01:07.110> that<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.530> adds<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:08.010> really

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
first but I think that it adds a really

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.120 
first but I think that it adds a really
noticeably<00:01:09.810> more<00:01:10.080> complex<00:01:10.619> layer<00:01:10.860> to

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
noticeably more complex layer to

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.730 
noticeably more complex layer to
Skylanders<00:01:11.700> which<00:01:11.960> up<00:01:12.960> until<00:01:13.140> now<00:01:13.350> you<00:01:13.530> know

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740

figurines<00:01:15.299> which<00:01:15.570> which<00:01:16.049> are<00:01:16.200> kind<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.439> cool

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
figurines which which are kind of cool

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:17.899

still<00:02:18.380> it's<00:02:18.680> it's<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.070> new<00:02:19.250> game<00:02:19.460> there's<00:02:19.850> a

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
still it's it's a new game there's a

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.430 
still it's it's a new game there's a
full<00:02:20.180> game<00:02:20.330> there<00:02:20.630> it's<00:02:20.780> not<00:02:20.930> like<00:02:21.110> just<00:02:21.260> a

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
full game there it's not like just a

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.200 
full game there it's not like just a
couple<00:02:21.860> new<00:02:22.130> levels<00:02:22.460> or<00:02:22.640> a<00:02:22.670> little<00:02:22.880> bit<00:02:23.000> of<00:02:23.120> an

couple new levels or a little bit of an

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.880 
couple new levels or a little bit of an
expansion<00:02:23.570> there<00:02:24.350> they're<00:02:24.620> making

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
expansion there they're making

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.080 
expansion there they're making
improvements<00:02:25.400> here<00:02:25.490> I<00:02:25.520> think<00:02:25.760> it's<00:02:25.850> really

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
improvements here I think it's really

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.640 
improvements here I think it's really
good<00:02:26.210> that<00:02:26.240> they're<00:02:26.450> actually<00:02:26.840> doing<00:02:27.380> some

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
good that they're actually doing some

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:28.930 
good that they're actually doing some
stuff<00:02:27.860> with<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.640> figures

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
stuff with with the the figures

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.340 
stuff with with the the figures
themselves<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.540> opposed<00:02:29.810> to<00:02:29.870> just<00:02:30.050> trying<00:02:30.230> to

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
themselves as opposed to just trying to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.860 
themselves as opposed to just trying to
introduce<00:02:30.650> new<00:02:30.770> game<00:02:30.980> mechanics<00:02:31.460> because<00:02:32.210> at
