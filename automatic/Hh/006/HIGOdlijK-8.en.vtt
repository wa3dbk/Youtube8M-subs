00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
since I was a kid and that is totally

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
since I was a kid and that is totally
wrong<00:01:10.320> the<00:01:10.799> reality<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.340> this<00:01:11.460> if<00:01:11.670> you<00:01:11.790> never

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
wrong the reality is this if you never

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.190 
wrong the reality is this if you never
spike<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.510> blood<00:01:12.540> sugar<00:01:12.869> you<00:01:12.900> don't<00:01:13.049> need

spike your blood sugar you don't need

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.469 
spike your blood sugar you don't need
too<00:01:13.439> much<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.130> can't<00:01:14.400> store<00:01:14.670> fat<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
too much you can't store fat so you

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.359 
too much you can't store fat so you
should<00:01:15.869> eat<00:01:16.049> before<00:01:16.320> bed<00:01:16.530> think<00:01:16.890> of<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:17.009> baby<00:01:17.250> a

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
should eat before bed think of a baby a

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
should eat before bed think of a baby a
baby<00:01:17.460> feeds<00:01:17.970> every<00:01:18.210> three<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.479> four<00:01:18.630> hours

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
they had a balance of protein fat carbs

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.160 
they had a balance of protein fat carbs
and<00:01:20.700> breast<00:01:20.970> milk<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.450> they<00:01:21.810> descent<00:01:22.080> amount

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
and breast milk and they descent amount

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.690 
and breast milk and they descent amount
of<00:01:22.290> calories<00:01:22.619> per<00:01:22.770> meal<00:01:22.860> they<00:01:23.009> eat<00:01:23.250> before<00:01:23.670> bed

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
of calories per meal they eat before bed

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.460 
of calories per meal they eat before bed
we<00:01:24.390> just<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> eat<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> right<00:01:24.960> thing

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
we just have to eat the right thing
