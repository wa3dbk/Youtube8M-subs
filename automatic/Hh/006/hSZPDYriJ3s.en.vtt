let's<00:00:03.420> have<00:00:03.600> a<00:00:03.630> look<00:00:03.929> at<00:00:04.140> a<00:00:04.170> term<00:00:04.470> called

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
let's have a look at a term called

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.869 
let's have a look at a term called
intelligent<00:00:05.910> design<00:00:07.100> people<00:00:08.100> have<00:00:08.430> created

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:08.879 
intelligent design people have created

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.209 
intelligent design people have created
many<00:00:09.059> types<00:00:09.420> of<00:00:09.600> design<00:00:10.020> that<00:00:10.590> became<00:00:10.949> quite

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
many types of design that became quite

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.480 
many types of design that became quite
successful<00:00:11.369> and<00:00:12.059> famous<00:00:12.860> but<00:00:13.860> can<00:00:14.070> design

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
successful and famous but can design

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.620 
successful and famous but can design
also<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:15.119> intelligent<00:00:15.890> it<00:00:16.890> can<00:00:17.220> but<00:00:18.150> only<00:00:18.240> with

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
also be intelligent it can but only with

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.750 
also be intelligent it can but only with
a<00:00:18.660> little<00:00:18.960> footnote

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
a little footnote

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.430 
a little footnote
it's<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:21.000> designer<00:00:21.450> who<00:00:21.780> is<00:00:21.840> able<00:00:22.230> to<00:00:22.320> be

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
it's the designer who is able to be

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.010 
it's the designer who is able to be
intelligent<00:00:23.300> by<00:00:24.300> following<00:00:24.780> certain

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.020 
intelligent by following certain

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.160 
intelligent by following certain
parameters<00:00:25.680> like<00:00:26.130> functionality<00:00:27.170> usability

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
parameters like functionality usability

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.820 
parameters like functionality usability
and<00:00:28.770> longevity<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:30.170> designer<00:00:31.170> is<00:00:31.440> able<00:00:31.710> to

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
and longevity a designer is able to

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.030 
and longevity a designer is able to
produce<00:00:32.210> intelligent<00:00:33.210> design<00:00:33.890> but<00:00:34.890> this

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
produce intelligent design but this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.240 
produce intelligent design but this
ability<00:00:35.310> isn't<00:00:35.820> ready-made<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.130> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
ability isn't ready-made it is the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.270 
ability isn't ready-made it is the
result<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.910> personal<00:00:39.420> experiences<00:00:40.170> and<00:00:41.100> is

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
result of personal experiences and is

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.240 
result of personal experiences and is
also<00:00:41.640> based<00:00:41.880> on<00:00:42.030> knowledge<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:43.070> education<00:00:44.070> and

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
also based on knowledge on education and

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.290 
also based on knowledge on education and
on<00:00:44.850> individual<00:00:45.450> skills<00:00:46.940> intelligent<00:00:47.940> design

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
on individual skills intelligent design

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.690 
on individual skills intelligent design
is<00:00:48.660> always<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.290> outcome<00:00:49.440> of<00:00:49.980> personal

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
is always the outcome of personal

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.560 
is always the outcome of personal
evolution<00:00:51.920> by<00:00:52.920> now<00:00:53.160> you<00:00:53.220> may<00:00:53.579> ask<00:00:53.760> yourself<00:00:53.969> is

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
evolution by now you may ask yourself is

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
evolution by now you may ask yourself is
there<00:00:55.079> really<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.590> need<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:55.950> this<00:00:56.280> explanation

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:57.590 
there really a need for this explanation

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.340 
there really a need for this explanation
unfortunately<00:00:58.590> there<00:00:59.309> is<00:01:00.079> the<00:01:01.079> term

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
unfortunately there is the term

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.100 
unfortunately there is the term
intelligent<00:01:02.070> design<00:01:02.460> is<00:01:02.790> also<00:01:03.420> used<00:01:03.750> in<00:01:03.989> a

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
intelligent design is also used in a

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.190 
intelligent design is also used in a
totally<00:01:04.649> different<00:01:04.680> way<00:01:05.630> the<00:01:06.630> term<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> then

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
totally different way the term is then

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.830 
totally different way the term is then
used<00:01:07.560> to<00:01:07.740> describe<00:01:08.249> a<00:01:08.459> supernatural<00:01:08.969> concept

been designed by the way things in
nature<00:01:32.369> become<00:01:32.939> instant<00:01:33.479> products<00:01:33.899> of<00:01:34.139> an

nature become instant products of an

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
unearthly design so if nature is

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.550 
unearthly design so if nature is
supposed<00:01:39.029> to<00:01:39.119> be<00:01:39.299> made<00:01:39.569> by<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.899> intelligent

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
supposed to be made by the intelligent

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.279 
supposed to be made by the intelligent
designer<00:01:40.999> then<00:01:41.999> what<00:01:42.240> about<00:01:42.509> human

00:01:43.279 --> 00:01:43.289 
designer then what about human

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.739 
designer then what about human
intelligence<00:01:43.819> has<00:01:44.819> it<00:01:44.999> also<00:01:45.179> been<00:01:45.419> planned
