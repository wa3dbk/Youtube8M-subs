00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.279
 the rain is fascinating 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.589
 how it influences our emotions 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:32.109
 for example the epic movies the battle always happens during a 

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:34.190
 strong storm 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.990
 the dramatic movies the sadness 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:39.990
 it will intensify with the rain 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.690
 maybe all this happens because the sky darkens and we lose sight of our 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.760
 Sun 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.780
 our hope 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.010
 suddenly our reality of the census 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.010
 if there were problems one after the other 

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.710
 reboceros just 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.100
 in his honor the fords or jealous of falling 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.160
 2 - at its headquarters 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.160
 finally castle 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 stressed that in their lives 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.210
 you wanted to prevent 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.580
 then it will rain 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.660
 it's prohibited 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.660
 no shine the moment 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.510
 However 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.510
 it's interesting because the bible and rain and storms are coming 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.759
 in that his intentions about men one who builds his case on the rock 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.820
 and one who builds his case on the sand 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.370
 then in both cases comes the rain and the good results that both have 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:50.670
 the one who built his house on the rock 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.600
 prevailed while the other lost everything and his ruin was winning 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.260
 he remembered that the boy 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.770
 what to do with my dad 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
 nor the rain reached us while still far from home 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.209
 should be the one that children know best 

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:16.929
 it's funny how years later 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:19.929
 when a problem if you intercept old 

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:24.389
 but still they tell us wonderful things 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:26.289
 God says 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:27.979
 know more about me 

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.819
 I listen 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.069
 it also tells us 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.069
 I can not ignore the weeping of the afflicted 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.930
 the psalmist spoke again and again to cry and cry 

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:21.899
 the spill is 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:26.649
 toshiba ideas rectify to approach god a study of perfect dances 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.739
 like a sunny day 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:32.329
 but god that if his word 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:33.939
 next to oscar dÃ­az 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:36.939
 with his problems with his panda runners 

00:03:44.559 --> 00:03:47.459
 that one under the rain 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.329
 my dad from the pool 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.329
 in reality all I could see was storm 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:56.699
 it always happens without success 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:59.429
 we pay more attention to the storm 

00:03:59.429 --> 00:04:01.589
 and we forget that he diverted without bail
