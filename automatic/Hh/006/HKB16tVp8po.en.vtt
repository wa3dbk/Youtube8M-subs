00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.240
 epoxy sticks are fillers 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:15.540
 excellent for wood finished or without 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.460
 finish they have two components one of 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.550
 which is wrapped inside the 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.740
 another and both its durability and its 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.960
 viscosity are very high 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.779
 These chopsticks are usually used 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.000
 over large damaged areas on the 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.550
 which is highly glued to his 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.460
 idiosyncrasy assures us an arrangement 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.100
 permanent however to take advantage 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.739
 the rustic nature is also 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.379
 use on smaller areas than at 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:47.100
 general are treated by carvings 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.230
 fire cut a piece of the stick according to 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.300
 the size of the damage requires it 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.420
 Press the epoxy between your fingers and 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.390
 form a massera ball until the 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.970
 ball becomes a single color 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.940
 press this mixture into the area 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:08.220
 damaged and love of the inside of the contour 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:11.100
 of the damaged area 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.710
 You can use a putty knife or 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.300
 a plastic card to help you 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.300
 shape the epoxy 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.060
 to prevent the putty from sticking 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.340
 to the tools it is good to wet the 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.910
 these with water before you start 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.580
 work in the same way is good to get wet 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.150
 finger to help shape 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:39.090
 Putty now eliminate all the excess 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.780
 of epoxy putty that can not have 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.690
 that sanding so much later leave this 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:49.190
 filler to dry and harden is 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:52.560
 it will dry in approximately eight minutes 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:55.020
 choose and level the area using the same 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.020
 sandpaper that was used before to 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:02.460
 Smooth the wood either layer 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:06.810
 open aluminum oxide p 180 or the 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.190
 of garnet from 150 to paralyze the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.550
 filling 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.090
 now you need to color better and 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.070
 put a final coat on this arrangement 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:20.040
 the epoxy sticks come in several 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.800
 colors you can use the colors by 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.100
 separate or can be mixed to create 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:28.500
 accurate colors tailored to 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.650
 help you mix colors accurately 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.290
 and without waste we have developed a 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.020
 guide to mix colors that include 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.830
 many colors and formulas that should 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.710
 be followed to obtain said colors in 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.080
 this example the second color that is 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.410
 within the first column is the most 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:51.840
 exact the formula we would use to 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:54.480
 get it would be to mix three 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:58.080
 equal parts of the color a for each 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.780
 equal part of the color see the code that 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.570
 we see at the bottom of the table it tells us that 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.570
 our formula would be to mix three 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:09.570
 equal parts of the color oak and walnut 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.080
 clear with an equal part of the color 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.080
 Walnut 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.209
 to create units that serve as parts 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:21.599
 same we have cut equal pieces of 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.549
 each color then we have cut each one 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.799
 of these pieces in four sections 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.010
 the same according to the formula 

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:31.500
 we will take three sections of the color oak 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.989
 light walnut and a color section 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 walnut to try to get the color 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.319
 desired the sections are kneaded together and 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.989
 the rest of the 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.829
 sections can be saved and used in 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:45.829
 another time
