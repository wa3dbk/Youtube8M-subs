00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.899
 hello my name is more classic 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.700
 Today I present my new video 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:07.760
 Collection for the company hair trimmer 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.410
 Munich 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.950
 sometimes customers have a hairstyle idea 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.690
 in the head 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.420
 that just can not be realized 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.690
 or only with extremely much styling effort 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.789
 works we opt for 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.650
 a hairdresser short area with the 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:25.080
 the customers can identify 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.500
 To grow it makes the hair too strong 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500
 damaged 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.629
 I start with the first division 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.629
 the completely different sections 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.070
 then i compile a section after the 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.320
 other 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:55.630
 I start with a on the back of my head 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.630
 Parallel grading to reduce weight 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.460
 if we are here with the tip of the scissors 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.060
 We can work every whirl and 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.710
 to balance hair growth well 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.700
 also on the side he works one 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.700
 soft cut line 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.479
 in between, I control mine 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.479
 cut in the natural case 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.530
 Now I'm cutting the top of my head 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:52.420
 an internal grading and hides the 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.420
 hair from the top of the head home 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.620
 with the Schaumfestiger give the upper head 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.620
 the necessary stop 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.200
 I feel the hair with a big one 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.200
 volume brush 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.520
 After that, I show my clients how 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.430
 varied their styling possibilities 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.470
 are whether with hairspray or wax the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:18.209
 Hairstyle can be worn in all directions 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.010
 become 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.050
 the result after that is perfect 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.380
 Our customers feel right from the start 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.380
 well
