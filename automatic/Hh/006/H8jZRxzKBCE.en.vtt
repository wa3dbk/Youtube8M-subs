egg to look shiny so here's a great way
just<00:02:19.280> draw<00:02:19.550> a<00:02:21.160> couple<00:02:22.160> of<00:02:22.250> skinny<00:02:22.670> ovals<00:02:23.600> just

00:02:24.009 --> 00:02:24.019 
just draw a couple of skinny ovals just

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.290 
just draw a couple of skinny ovals just
on<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.200> surface<00:02:24.560> on<00:02:24.709> one<00:02:24.920> side<00:02:25.160> now<00:02:26.120> this

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:26.300 
on the surface on one side now this

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.520 
on the surface on one side now this
actually<00:02:26.540> kind<00:02:26.780> of<00:02:26.900> looks<00:02:27.050> like<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.230> fat

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
actually kind of looks like a fat

actually kind of looks like a fat
exclamation<00:02:28.250> mark<00:02:28.430> -<00:02:28.690> so<00:02:29.690> that<00:02:29.900> way<00:02:30.080> it's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
exclamation mark - so that way it's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.110 
exclamation mark - so that way it's
going<00:02:30.650> to<00:02:30.739> make<00:02:30.890> your<00:02:31.100> character<00:02:31.519> look<00:02:31.670> extra

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120

going to make your character look extra
shiny<00:02:32.420> and<00:02:33.400> just<00:02:34.400> go<00:02:34.700> ahead<00:02:34.850> and<00:02:35.540> do<00:02:36.530> all<00:02:36.739> sorts

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:37.280 
shiny and just go ahead and do all sorts

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.830 
shiny and just go ahead and do all sorts
of<00:02:37.340> different<00:02:37.400> patterns<00:02:38.120> you<00:02:38.480> can<00:02:38.690> try

of different patterns you can try

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.110 
of different patterns you can try
different<00:02:38.959> designs<00:02:39.500> in<00:02:39.830> there<00:02:40.070> I'm<00:02:40.880> going<00:02:41.060> to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
different designs in there I'm going to
