00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome to another part of 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.930
 years of hans mÃ¼ller tutorial the last 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.110
 Sometimes there was a small summary 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:14.219
 the first four chapters and today 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:20.609
 let's come up with something completely new, and that too 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:23.820
 Variables One variable one can get 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.970
 thought of as a container which one 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:33.630
 Can catch something 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:39.050
 But a container can always only 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:42.180
 a type that fits only one thing 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:45.539
 there are different types of data in java 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.360
 today we will be the numerical 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:52.829
 data types, however, by taking only 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.940
 for whole numbers these are long and short 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:01.340
 at these four pieces are there for it 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.340
 I made a little survey 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.220
 and that looks like 1 is made up of 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.409
 a forest as the name suggests, to 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:16.650
 goes from the pay range - 128 to 127 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:25.020
 one dead two soon one in eight eight 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:26.939
 soon another each 8 bit from it 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 arise on the length of the numbers 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:33.630
 but I will not go any further 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.270
 how do you declare such a container like that 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:41.939
 a variable in which one was once a number 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:45.780
 can save, and if one 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:48.470
 So integrate into variable handfuls 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.470
 the key 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:01.510
 that says what kind 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:04.870
 the variable should be so what this 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:07.750
 container should then we need 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.180
 another name for this 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:18.960
 container with we recognize the 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:23.650
 if we can paint with it 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:27.550
 We declare the variable she has 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.640
 can take an integer number and means 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:35.040
 test 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:38.740
 we have much more in the method 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.680
 this container had a value so far 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.380
 he still has no content we have 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:47.380
 so far only space reserved for 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.410
 a corresponding variable for one 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:54.880
 corresponding for a corresponding 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:59.380
 filling the variable we do that by 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.150
 the same and then a number in the 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:06.390
 Write corresponding numbers range 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:10.810
 for example, 14 6 456 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:15.660
 so we have a variable here 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.150
 generated with the name test and here 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:22.120
 we have realized the works 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.720
 that means we have a value here 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.720
 assigned 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:32.680
 You can do it all this way 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:37.140
 But you can do it all in one 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:41.400
 For example , line equals in test 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.400
 at 42 34 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.340
 we can do the whole thing 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.480
 of course, to what extent maine write 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:55.630
 however, it should be noted that 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.450
 this variable 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:02.070
 only on the brackets refers that is 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:05.920
 in another way we could 

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:07.540
 this variable test unused 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:10.960
 or you can not out 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.400
 meanwhile, she is standing by 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:19.690
 The Weidmann also looks outside of this 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:24.580
 stand because this is variable 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:27.490
 yes no command she does this then can 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.510
 Any method will access this time 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.000
 and they change 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:42.460
 For example, I can go here then how far 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:45.850
 my write test equal 680 afterwards 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:47.010
 but it comes, for example, six 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:51.100
 become 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:55.210
 that would be all we want now 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:58.930
 Now a variable of the type at 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.290
 then we have exactly the same 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.290
 procedure 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.700
 We write as the first team type then 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.560
 the call 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:14.950
 and then we can share three 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:18.520
 idealization with value if 

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:22.020
 caliber the main income and the mountain 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.020
 first to point out the broad 

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:28.210
 important is always that single nicola 

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:34.230
 under the day because this is an instruction 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.230
 Thank you for seeing
