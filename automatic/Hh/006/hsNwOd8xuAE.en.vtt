00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:06.090
 we will present the 50 suspects 

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.090
 this kit that has the 50 kg weight support 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.479
 kit sold separately 

00:00:12.479 --> 00:00:16.269
 what will you for the external poll door to the inner door 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.419
 the great advantage of this type of presentation 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.470
 and what 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.380
 no need to buy extra parts 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.810
 according to your project 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.989
 both the kit and external door as well as internal door 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:33.300
 are composed of two upper cars 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.330
 two lower guides 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:36.630
 two brakes 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.910
 two stops and what gives you the outer door 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:42.690
 the use of wheat flour 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.940
 all with the screws for mounting 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.800
 initially we will demonstrate how to fix the cars on the doors in the hot you go 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.280
 receive a template just like them doing the folds in the indicated places 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.490
 installing and putting it on the door you will get the exact drill points 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:06.480
 for placing the kits on what I had are sent to special funds 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.700
 simply drill the jig and use these screws to 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.080
 better attachment of the product to the door 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.720
 the bottom should be there 4mm in diameter at 16mm 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.010
 depth 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.670
 now let's install on the rails 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.270
 so check the tables 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.460
 distance installation 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 of the rail according to the thickness of the door 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:34.060
 see now top rail table 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.270
 and now the bottom rail table 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.150
 after being installed on rails 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 at the top we must install the brakes 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.900
 check that there is a brake on the right side or on the left side 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.110
 in the lower part will be installed the guides 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.749
 remember if 

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:02.439
 that with the bettors 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.590
 we will get maguila in the back with a slightly larger distance 

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:14.499
 not forget also to apply the stops on the sides 

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:18.869
 adjusting according to the air 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:22.579
 need to move the door 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.769
 after being placed on the rails 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:25.930
 just fit 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.189
 first the inner door 

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:32.599
 being that it is inferior here must first enter the rail 

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:34.949
 then the top 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:38.219
 after locked down days of the inner door 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:42.209
 started the same process with the external port 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.069
 by first fitting the lower part then the upper part 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.949
 reaching 3 thousand 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.519
 this way you will effect even locking in the bottom 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:59.409
 now simply the troubled door to check with the squadron of the 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.919
 mobile 

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:03.279
 the suspended cd 50 is installed
