 it is in vilvorde a few kilometers 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.110
 from brussels that we went 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.480
 look for the answers at the end of this 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.910
 industrial zone is hiding a factory 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:19.039
 very discreet subsidiary of one of the most 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:20.960
 major European chemical groups 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.130
 one makes one of the most 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.470
 used by industry 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:29.599
 the e 441 more commonly known as gelatin 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:32.599
 and the factory sales manager 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.430
 michel vanden berghe is not proud 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.480
 to show us everything we happen to 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:40.250
 to make with its miracle product 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.750
 shown some examples of the main 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.239
 gelatin applications 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:47.989
 we have so much food 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:51.230
 that the most important application to 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.390
 global level all products 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.250
 gelled the first market for him this 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.230
 are candies but we also find 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.860
 know Latin who in capsules 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:09.830
 pharmaceutical film dandruff and 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:13.159
 even shampoos but for that it 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:16.070
 must always produce more then here the 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:19.100
 sinn is running at full speed and the famous 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:23.020
 latin michel van den berghe here it is 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.020
 who comes out at the end of the chain 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.740
 fazal e amin 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.640
 it's his spaghetti that sticks to 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.270
 fingers 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.259
 three four days 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.259
 material preparation 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.520
 c 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.619
 three or four days of transformation 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.869
 in the bowels of a factory where these 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.909
 huge tanks filled with acid and 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:54.509
 boiling make a dampness prevail 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.770
 tropical and in the middle of this 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.369
 atmosphere and or ford 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.289
 there is a detail that strikes the visitor 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.970
 and that penetrates into the premises 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:04.970
 the most protected of the machined 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.690
 it 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.690
 and 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.600
 to make debate 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.050
 a pungent smell of acid and fat 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.330
 burned that floats all over the site 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.200
 to the outside of the machined and the 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.860
 because of this smell 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.870
 there she is 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.760
 it is the raw material with which 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.550
 we make gelatin we process 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:37.920
 the intake of pork skin that arrive 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.120
 by whole pallets in his factory a 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.010
 raw material that does not cost him 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.460
 almost nothing and they buy in 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.460
 all of Europe 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.680
 these come from hungary to flavor of 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.490
 hungary okay there and every day 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:54.710
 almost 150 tons of pork rind 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:56.630
 wait in this shed to be devoured 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:03:01.120
 by a steel monster with names 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.120
 evocative dinosaur us 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.980
 thanks to this good raw material 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.930
 market michel van den berghe manages to 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.320
 sell its gelatine less than 5 euros the 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.940
 kg an unbeatable price that 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:29.360
 constantly opens up new markets 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.370
 and who is doing well right now 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.580
 it is the product market 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.580
 light 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:43.290
 well here is this a lean butter 40% 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:47.310
 then a fresh cheese 0% materials 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.640
 fat and at home we find even the 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.670
 bigger brands 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:57.120
 we mark danone fine size foam 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:04:00.150
 Liegeoise from here is a moss 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:03.630
 a foam of which she is proud then a 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.400
 product towards roofing so with less and 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.890
 fat 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:09.690
 so to stabilize the product 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.660
 for mathilde were the products on 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.880
 Latin divides a product that the 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.650
 industrialists do not hesitate to use 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.450
 large quantity 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.010
 the only problem is that they forget 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.930
 sometimes write it on the labels 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.750
 when we look at them we read the 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:26.690
 mention gelatin but not the origin of the 

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.770
 product 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.850
 imad gelatin but not say what is 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.020
 the origin of gelatin 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:35.460
 why does not he assume that from 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:38.600
 ports that's not the problem they have 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.600
 with writing with that 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:44.610
 I do it's the promise of tain it's 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:48.530
 a very sensitive subject in what is 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:52.199
 still minorities minerals 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.189
 Jewish Muslim minority and others who 

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:54.689
 possibly have problems with that 

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:56.610
 and would have left only their 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.830
 to say that I would not want it to be good 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.750
 but it's not so crazy but that in 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.550
 the show but it's true what good 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:12.210
 because suddenly they do not know if 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:14.520
 it's port a question that leaves 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.780
 michel van den berghe his voice and to 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:18.150
 which no mark of 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:20.729
 agribusiness did not wish to respond 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:22.169
 despite our many requests to 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.030
 believe that pork gelatin is a 

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.690
 topic on which they prefer to stay 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:26.690
 discreet
