00:00:10.169 --> 00:00:13.529
 Once a year, the best ice climbers meet here in Kandersteg 

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.929
 Europe and show 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:18.179
 always with ice axes and crampons the steepest slopes defeats 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.929
 As an extreme sport is old clothes fully in vogue here so I'm exactly 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.929
 right 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.250
 HK it's an Altbier winter day from the picture book we have here around the -1 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.740
 Minus three degrees Celsius 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.620
 it's just cold enough that ours was her when her feet popped obstacles 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.990
 they were well in the squad, the competition is held 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:43.910
 the Mainzers each rise when I come here for the right one 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.970
 The fascination of the ice climbing center will be there, it would be enough for the old ones 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.970
 4 4 still have the right equipment 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.760
 Circle Kleve if it is dangerous 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.760
 That's why the right equipment is my life insurance 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.820
 Markus Bentler Help to put on Kurt and crampons 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180
 the quadruple world champion climbs since the age of eleven 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.670
 DAPD 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:14.480
 that is, that is 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.460
 as small amounts should be incredibly exhausting 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.100
 how exhausting that is impossible 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.380
 we are already pretty exhausting and measured 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.270
 Food - in the beginning 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.640
 dpa - first time makes Meisel onerous 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.530
 his grandfather strain is concerned 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.480
 Nat's are rare 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.480
 will not notice soon that will be exhausting 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.700
 if the others are training there I finally want to go to the 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.130
 real 1 percent 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.180
 There is no other area in the Alps with so many 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.750
 live like that and prove so impressively when we are in the squad why 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 and I do not know if I'll ever be that much easier 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.450
 these individual are not only 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.789
 incredibly fascinating 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:09.789
 it can also be quite dangerous, unlike rocks 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.020
 changes the ice depending on temperatures but payment constantly 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:13.949
 his structure 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:14.900
 Op Petrov 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:15.639
 this wall 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.489
 is safe 

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.129
 SID that's for sure right temperature right humidity it's not too 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:23.090
 everything is elastic 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.930
 therefore it is completely safe today what to think it comes less and less that 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.499
 So that means I can do this band 

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:30.819
 Cuxhaven 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.969
 is indeed a real Michels and pay off entirely by percent 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:39.279
 I should climb 15 meters high 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:40.479
 Here we go 

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:44.529
 with all my strength RAM I mean both of my polar bears are and pretty high 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.049
 Meter by meter 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.929
 my whole body weight hangs only on my arms 

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:53.279
 for the stirrup, I make sure that I am before Chur 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:56.279
 fortunately not sure Pietro with a rope 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.609
 After 15 minutes I made the 15 meters 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.609
 and I am completely out of breath 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.819
 I can think so 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:13.249
 now determine 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:16.319
 I did not use anything there. "I have to go back downstairs 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.319
 fortunately, that is much faster 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.759
 this is just my first ICE on the slope 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:25.039
 Bristol and it is incredibly exhausting 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.289
 I can not see who wants to see them 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.539
 but it is incredible 

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:33.789
 by Heinrich LÃ¶hr once had climbed on bonds and blue-white 

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:34.559
 long 

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:37.589
 it is under the internet 

00:03:37.589 --> 00:03:40.519
 the ultimate kick 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:41.919
 then he becomes addicted 

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:45.559
 in half an hour I have strength in my arms again and try myself 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.199
 the next as were 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:50.379
 a breathtaking challenge in the middle of nature 

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.409
 and definitely an unparalleled adventure
