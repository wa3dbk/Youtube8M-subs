00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:16.789
 avira is our document style 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:20.010
 camera the the alexa picture quality 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.410
 combined with ergonomics for 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.780
 the single user for the shoulder operation 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.520
 Optimized it is a first first 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.020
 first line very stable camera 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.949
 mount is very stable the whole housing 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.140
 very stable 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.550
 The electronics are encapsulated that is 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.620
 it can not be water it can not 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.360
 Moisture can not be sand or 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.520
 Something about the electronics is coming 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.590
 all the capsule is he is very sturdy 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.950
 one has the alexa image quality with the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.500
 14 dazzle with 1 child house with it 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.260
 with the fourteenth dynamic range with 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.120
 the 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.010
 highlight handling with the color 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.620
 rendering that is all identical and 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.539
 so far, the amira is a complete one 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.879
 new development in terms of electronics at 

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:01.089
 the sensor levels of alexa are what 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:03.489
 we see now is a pre-production model 

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:05.440
 that's what often nrw here now 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.049
 show the first pre-production models 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.970
 stand and we expect that the 

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:12.159
 serial models are still delivered 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.020
 this month the amira there in 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:18.369
 There are three versions in the canonical 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:21.399
 version which can be 1080i and 1080p in 

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:24.250
 rexingen no who knows where it 422 and 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:26.110
 can make up to 100 pictures like 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.080
 also all other models has one 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.569
 Beijing function with Haller Beijing car 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.750
 with apache she has an ex porsche 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:37.780
 control function with from scala or with 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:42.280
 zebra and that too can be natural 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.500
 modify image parameters or gamma 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.299
 or situation has such things about it 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.380
 There is another fear 

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:53.259
 which can then 42 hq poor s the edge 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.069
 up to 200 pictures that can also be relaxed 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.560
 take up 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:59.010
 It has complete air functionality 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.440
 so can also implement 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.840
 which can modify the parameters 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.240
 in addition, then also dynamic 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.980
 car further dynamic white balance the 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.320
 then automatically adjusts itself when 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.200
 change the white balance values 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.390
 which can has a remote function for 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.370
 the camera over wifi has one 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 prepaid function and that too can 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.790
 Bluetooth audio monitoring So that's me 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.680
 with the bluetooth the white then my 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.650
 then there is the audio 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.690
 amira premium which can go beyond that 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.260
 then another 2 k can 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:34.320
 14 444 444 times right 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.600
 and that can 3d lutz the trading system 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.620
 be generated so fits and also 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.390
 Import important when shoulder 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.880
 Operation is just that until it's primary 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.260
 the balance that the camera in the 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.270
 balance whether the blame and over 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.680
 this dovetail down here can 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.480
 I get the wonderful balance 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.730
 also with with such objective or 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.640
 even bigger and if i am here 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.950
 down the shoulder the ball must support 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.540
 of course, the search to fit and 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.600
 Accordingly, I can also search 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:01.260
 in the right position 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.270
 Of course you have more 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.820
 possibilities here about the search 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.500
 suspension from the height or from the 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.780
 wherever the search should be me 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.720
 there still vary a lot and it can 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.860
 then 5 personally ergonomic then 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.590
 optimally designed 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.959
 I have just changed a new ju 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.820
 everything connects with one with one 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.470
 tft display as i have here in monitor 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.269
 of course I see the live picture as well 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.170
 like i can control the whole camera 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.350
 can make 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:34.050
 as well as 1 1 1 12 80 alice which has hd 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:36.810
 resolution of the ips something in very good 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:39.480
 image quality in the finder itself offers 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.670
 which is very very important 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.739
 that the viewfinder image is an optimal and 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.950
 next to it the possibility with this 

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:48.930
 from cloud monitor with the one then just 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.820
 even if we are from the 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:52.830
 hip turns or out of position kicks 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.269
 can not look to the viewfinder stop 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:55.590
 can also judge the picture with it 

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.390
 able to work because here the 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.760
 einblendung so you can see that the 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.010
 Visitors can then make it 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.260
 work and what to do separate monitor 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.300
 still still needs next 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:09.010
 you can also use the camera 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.630
 So with the search there are some 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.550
 Functions just looking for specific 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:14.140
 Meanwhile, Beijing is helix 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:15.520
 Porsche on it can directly here 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.290
 turn on we also see here 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:20.170
 best 

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:22.180
 Here's the zebra and I can do that too 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:24.010
 put a zoom function on it that I do 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 pure zoom can so can here with 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:27.340
 a very self also very much 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.350
 beautiful then the things served the 

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.940
 Trials are relevant and the whole 

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:32.320
 how the parts are on the left side 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.700
 I have this position for 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:36.100
 white balance I can tell you about one 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:37.600
 far from picking up the motive or simply car 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.940
 I can program it too 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.070
 in the menu then adjust in kelvin value 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.990
 or even in the cc value set the same 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.730
 Applies to the second floor of the exposure 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.310
 index that means I can stop here 

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:49.360
 which asa number I would like to have 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.970
 which of course also accordingly 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.400
 program on different value of 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:56.020
 top switch is configurable there 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.670
 I can put on lux, for example 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:59.380
 if I have loaded lux at camera 

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:01.120
 switch spree between lux 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.520
 I can also guess frame rate 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:05.170
 So can say yes that's 25 to 50 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.050
 that there are 200 and can be fast between 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:10.480
 switch the freemasons and have there 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.430
 a very intuitive way the 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.230
 camera to use without me in the 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.660
 menu has to go or even somewhere 

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.070
 just have to look what else 

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:21.780
 comes into the world of integrated 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:24.940
 intel fitter than I have with 6 12 and 21 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:25.260
 nd filter of the motorized retracted here 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.980
 becomes 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:31.840
 the camera draws on sofas 2.0 cards 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.919
 they are very high 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:38.680
 write speed up to 300 50 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:42.430
 Write megabit and read 450 by it 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:46.240
 Can we just the 200 pictures the the 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:49.030
 camera can in prores 4444 up to two 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.889
 write cards on the card and that 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.960
 last but not least, of course 

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:54.699
 complete audio recording functionality 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.499
 as well as the classic in jp 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.060
 morgan 

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:59.169
 we had very flexible cent advantage 

00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:00.599
 I can choose between the different ones 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:03.340
 Models after so between the 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:04.749
 economic version between the advents 

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:06.879
 version between the premium version 

00:06:04.749 --> 00:06:09.099
 switch easily by simply 

00:06:06.879 --> 00:06:11.379
 a license from the workshop more hole 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:12.759
 I can do that in the camera as well 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.110
 so I can also do it temporarily 

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:15.969
 Get the weekend license if I am 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.349
 now a job 

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:19.449
 However, acting pictures may need 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:20.979
 I get a license for one week 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:23.379
 then pick up the second 200 then 

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.330
 images are thus optimal 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:28.710
 flexibility and scalability what you get 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.710
 an investment attached
