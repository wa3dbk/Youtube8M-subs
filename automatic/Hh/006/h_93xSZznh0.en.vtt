on<00:03:25.140> the<00:03:25.320> right<00:03:25.530> side<00:03:25.890> it's<00:03:26.700> just<00:03:26.790> gonna<00:03:27.030> click

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:27.330 
on the right side it's just gonna click

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.900 
on the right side it's just gonna click
and<00:03:27.570> now<00:03:27.750> it's<00:03:27.930> on<00:03:28.170> so<00:03:28.530> now<00:03:28.740> it's<00:03:29.010> completely

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
and now it's on so now it's completely

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.880 
and now it's on so now it's completely
on<00:03:30.110> again<00:03:31.110> if<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.380> do<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.620> with<00:03:31.770> the<00:03:31.860> other

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
on again if you do it with the other

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.500 
on again if you do it with the other
side<00:03:32.370> you're<00:03:32.670> gonna<00:03:32.730> have<00:03:32.970> to<00:03:33.090> hold<00:03:33.300> it<00:03:33.450> down

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
side you're gonna have to hold it down

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.260 
side you're gonna have to hold it down
and<00:03:33.900> this<00:03:34.410> will<00:03:34.620> be<00:03:34.770> momentarily<00:03:35.460> which<00:03:36.060> is

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and this will be momentarily which is

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.660 
and this will be momentarily which is
again<00:03:36.740> trainings<00:03:37.740> gonna<00:03:37.860> dictate<00:03:38.250> how<00:03:38.610> you

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
again trainings gonna dictate how you

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.700 
again trainings gonna dictate how you
use<00:03:39.030> it<00:03:39.270> but<00:03:39.720> typically<00:03:40.170> that's<00:03:40.380> what<00:03:40.560> you

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:40.710 
use it but typically that's what you

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:42.230 
use it but typically that's what you
want<00:03:40.890> to<00:03:40.980> do<00:03:41.100> you<00:03:41.520> want<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:41.790> turn<00:03:42.030> it<00:03:42.150> on

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
want to do you want to turn it on

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.780 
want to do you want to turn it on
momentarily<00:03:43.010> identify<00:03:44.010> that<00:03:44.160> target<00:03:44.670> and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
momentarily identify that target and

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.000 
momentarily identify that target and
getting<00:03:45.120> engaged<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:46.230> that's<00:03:46.770> definitely

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
getting engaged so that's definitely

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.850 
getting engaged so that's definitely
pretty<00:03:47.670> good<00:03:47.970> and<00:03:48.180> ultimately<00:03:49.140> guys<00:03:49.320> if<00:03:49.590> you

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
pretty good and ultimately guys if you

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.920

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
hit it twice again if you hit it twice

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.200 
hit it twice again if you hit it twice
and<00:03:52.230> you<00:03:52.350> hold<00:03:52.650> it<00:03:52.800> you're<00:03:53.370> gonna<00:03:53.490> have<00:03:53.580> this

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
and you hold it you're gonna have this

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.620 
and you hold it you're gonna have this
strong<00:03:54.630> motor<00:03:54.900> right<00:03:55.260> here<00:03:56.060> there<00:03:57.060> we<00:03:57.210> go

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
strong motor right here there we go

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.720 
strong motor right here there we go
so<00:03:58.350> again<00:03:58.650> you're<00:03:58.860> gonna<00:03:58.950> be<00:03:59.130> doing<00:03:59.400> that<00:03:59.430> by

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
just hitting it twice and holding it

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.760 
just hitting it twice and holding it
down<00:04:02.160> oh<00:04:02.490> and<00:04:03.120> again<00:04:03.570> very<00:04:03.960> easy<00:04:04.290> to<00:04:04.410> use
