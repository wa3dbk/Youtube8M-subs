two separate pieces is it comes with two

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.610 
two separate pieces is it comes with two
different<00:00:33.970> boxes<00:00:34.150> you<00:00:34.870> get<00:00:35.020> the<00:00:35.140> bumper<00:00:35.500> in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620 
different boxes you get the bumper in

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.130 
different boxes you get the bumper in
one<00:00:35.830> and<00:00:36.100> then<00:00:36.460> you<00:00:36.550> get<00:00:36.670> the<00:00:37.140> additional

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140

cargo or I'm sorry rear hatch actually
dives<00:01:48.819> down<00:01:49.119> a<00:01:49.149> little<00:01:49.359> bit<00:01:49.479> right<00:01:49.659> here<00:01:49.780> so

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.170 
dives down a little bit right here so

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:53.219 
dives down a little bit right here so
this<00:01:50.289> makes<00:01:50.560> it<00:01:50.709> up<00:01:50.829> this<00:01:51.609> is<00:01:51.789> all<00:01:52.079> 3/16<00:01:53.079> as

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
this makes it up this is all 3/16 as

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.319 
this makes it up this is all 3/16 as
well<00:01:53.499> the<00:01:53.979> only<00:01:54.249> piece<00:01:54.490> that<00:01:54.700> isn't<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:55.149> this

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
eighth inch anyway let's look down at

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:06.599 
eighth inch anyway let's look down at
the<00:02:01.869> bottom<00:02:02.639> it's<00:02:03.639> got<00:02:04.569> some<00:02:04.810> rear<00:02:05.679> lights<00:02:06.310> I

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.520 
it with it you pay extra this is a three
inch<00:02:11.080> light<00:02:11.379> it's<00:02:12.250> a<00:02:12.370> hella<00:02:12.640> Model<00:02:13.510> 70<00:02:14.430> it's

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
inch light it's a hella Model 70 it's

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.530 
inch light it's a hella Model 70 it's
like<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.650> floodlight<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.610> I'll<00:02:17.030> have<00:02:17.300> it<00:02:17.420> hooked

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
like a floodlight so I'll have it hooked

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.500 
like a floodlight so I'll have it hooked
up<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:18.020> rear<00:02:18.580> switch<00:02:19.580> so<00:02:20.209> when<00:02:20.360> I<00:02:20.390> hit

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
up to the rear switch so when I hit

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.020 
up to the rear switch so when I hit
reverse<00:02:20.660> it<00:02:21.560> will<00:02:21.740> go<00:02:21.890> on<00:02:22.040> as<00:02:22.340> well<00:02:22.640> as<00:02:22.819> a

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
reverse it will go on as well as a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
reverse it will go on as well as a
switch<00:02:23.360> so<00:02:23.690> I'll<00:02:23.810> have<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.020> hooked<00:02:24.110> up<00:02:24.260> twice<00:02:24.560> a

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
switch so I'll have it hooked up twice a

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.040 
switch so I'll have it hooked up twice a
couple<00:02:25.550> of<00:02:25.640> openings<00:02:26.030> right<00:02:26.090> here<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.990> is

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
couple of openings right here this is

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.470 
couple of openings right here this is
the<00:02:27.520> receiver<00:02:28.520> hitch<00:02:28.760> as<00:02:29.000> you<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.300> see

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
the receiver hitch as you can see

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.960 
the receiver hitch as you can see
there's<00:02:29.660> no<00:02:29.780> pin<00:02:30.080> for<00:02:30.380> it<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.700> thus<00:02:31.700> the

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
there's no pin for it and thus the

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.870 
there's no pin for it and thus the
reason<00:02:32.270> for<00:02:32.390> the<00:02:32.510> opening<00:02:32.959> is<00:02:33.700> where<00:02:34.700> the

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
reason for the opening is where the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.199 
reason for the opening is where the
actual<00:02:35.209> pin<00:02:35.480> goes<00:02:36.260> through<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.250> kind<00:02:38.060> of<00:02:38.120> nice

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
actual pin goes through so kind of nice

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.510 
actual pin goes through so kind of nice
little<00:02:38.450> feature<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.840> hidden

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
little feature it's hidden

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.729 
little feature it's hidden
