00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.300 
so i should mention that TouchWiz on
this<00:03:37.610> the<00:03:38.200> 104<00:03:39.200> point<00:03:39.380> isn't<00:03:39.739> very<00:03:39.920> prevalent

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
this the 104 point isn't very prevalent

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.490 
this the 104 point isn't very prevalent
it's<00:03:40.670> it<00:03:40.940> actually<00:03:41.510> seems<00:03:41.720> pretty<00:03:41.840> nice<00:03:42.230> I

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
it's it actually seems pretty nice I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.650 
it's it actually seems pretty nice I
kind<00:03:42.709> of<00:03:42.739> like<00:03:42.980> it<00:03:43.010> because<00:03:43.579> I<00:03:43.970> know<00:03:44.389> before

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:44.660 
kind of like it because I know before

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.680 
kind of like it because I know before
TouchWiz<00:03:45.410> or

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
TouchWiz or

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.180 
TouchWiz or
like<00:03:45.810> they<00:03:45.990> change<00:03:46.260> the<00:03:46.410> icons<00:03:46.830> they<00:03:46.950> change

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
like they change the icons they change

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.400 
like they change the icons they change
everything<00:03:47.700> and<00:03:48.030> I<00:03:48.420> really<00:03:48.780> didn't<00:03:49.110> like<00:03:49.140> that

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.410 
everything and I really didn't like that

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:51.740 
everything and I really didn't like that
I<00:03:49.620> I<00:03:49.980> just<00:03:50.520> pretty<00:03:50.700> much<00:03:50.790> hated<00:03:51.150> that<00:03:51.390> almost

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:51.750 
I I just pretty much hated that almost

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.710 
I I just pretty much hated that almost
it<00:03:52.740> seemed<00:03:53.250> too<00:03:53.430> cartoony<00:03:54.120> and<00:03:54.150> now<00:03:54.390> it's

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
it seemed too cartoony and now it's

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.630 
it seemed too cartoony and now it's
finally<00:03:54.990> looking<00:03:55.410> for<00:03:55.650> more<00:03:55.920> professional

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
finally looking for more professional

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.600 
finally looking for more professional
instead<00:03:57.000> of<00:03:57.090> cartoony<00:03:57.600> and<00:03:58.340> that's<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.430> plus

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610 
instead of cartoony and that's the plus

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.550 
instead of cartoony and that's the plus
side<00:03:59.820> of<00:03:59.970> this<00:04:00.120> for<00:04:00.420> so<00:04:00.660> far<00:04:00.810> android<00:04:01.140> 4.2

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560

Samsung<00:04:02.280> learned<00:04:02.550> their<00:04:02.700> lesson<00:04:03.030> and<00:04:03.180> they're

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
Samsung learned their lesson and they're

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.110 
Samsung learned their lesson and they're
the<00:04:04.560> touch<00:04:04.770> the<00:04:04.980> new<00:04:05.160> TouchWiz<00:04:05.550> I<00:04:05.700> think<00:04:06.000> it's

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
the touch the new TouchWiz I think it's

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.560 
the touch the new TouchWiz I think it's
called<00:04:06.270> touch<00:04:06.450> was<00:04:06.630> for<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:07.140> would<00:04:07.620> assume<00:04:07.860> is

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:08.570 
called touch was for I would assume is

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:11.720 
called touch was for I would assume is
much<00:04:09.570> better<00:04:09.840> it<00:04:10.320> seems<00:04:10.560> much<00:04:10.770> better<00:04:10.980> just

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
much better it seems much better just

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.370 
much better it seems much better just
