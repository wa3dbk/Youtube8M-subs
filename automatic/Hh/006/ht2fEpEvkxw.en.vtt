hey<00:00:48.420> welcome<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.989> lesson<00:00:49.320> three<00:00:49.590> today<00:00:50.340> we're

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
hey welcome to lesson three today we're

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.220 
hey welcome to lesson three today we're
gonna<00:00:50.610> talk<00:00:50.910> about<00:00:50.940> the<00:00:51.420> ankle<00:00:51.750> stroke

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
gonna talk about the ankle stroke

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.889 
gonna talk about the ankle stroke
now<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:52.860> ankle<00:00:53.309> stroke<00:00:53.579> is<00:00:53.820> the<00:00:54.390> exact<00:00:54.719> same

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
now the ankle stroke is the exact same

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.200 
now the ankle stroke is the exact same
motion<00:00:55.140> as<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.710> toe<00:00:55.890> stroke<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.579> everything

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
motion as the toe stroke so everything

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.240 
motion as the toe stroke so everything
that<00:00:57.329> we<00:00:57.420> did<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.719> Lesson<00:00:58.050> one<00:00:58.289> is<00:00:58.680> hopefully

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
that we did in Lesson one is hopefully

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.490 
that we did in Lesson one is hopefully
going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.430> pay<00:00:59.609> off<00:00:59.789> for<00:00:59.820> today<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.230> only

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
going to pay off for today the only

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.399 
going to pay off for today the only
difference<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.120> with<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.270> toe<00:01:03.420> stroke<00:01:03.809> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
difference is with the toe stroke the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:05.780 
difference is with the toe stroke the
heel<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> resting<00:01:05.159> on<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.309> ground<00:01:05.580> of<00:01:05.760> the

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
heel is resting on the ground of the

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.850 
heel is resting on the ground of the
heel<00:01:06.000> plate<00:01:06.299> now<00:01:06.840> with<00:01:07.020> an<00:01:07.140> ankle<00:01:07.409> stroke<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
heel plate now with an ankle stroke the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
heel plate now with an ankle stroke the
leg<00:01:08.070> actually<00:01:08.369> lifts<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.180> foot<00:01:09.450> as<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:10.020> prep

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
leg actually lifts the foot as a prep

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.560 
leg actually lifts the foot as a prep
motion<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.369> that<00:01:11.400> it's<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.820> playing<00:01:12.060> position

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
motion so that it's in playing position

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.649 
motion so that it's in playing position
and<00:01:12.780> then<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.110> ankle<00:01:13.439> pivots<00:01:13.799> from<00:01:14.010> their

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:14.659 
and then the ankle pivots from their

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.929 
and then the ankle pivots from their
ankle<00:01:15.659> strokes<00:01:15.900> are<00:01:16.049> used<00:01:16.439> for<00:01:16.950> medium<00:01:17.700> fast

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
ankle strokes are used for medium fast

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.840 
ankle strokes are used for medium fast
to<00:01:18.450> fast<00:01:18.799> consecutive<00:01:19.799> notes<00:01:20.070> so<00:01:20.640> we're<00:01:20.759> going

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
to fast consecutive notes so we're going

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.480 
to fast consecutive notes so we're going
to<00:01:20.909> talk<00:01:21.060> about<00:01:21.210> speed<00:01:21.630> today<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.490> they're

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
to talk about speed today and they're

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.149 
to talk about speed today and they're
used<00:01:23.970> in<00:01:24.210> combination<00:01:24.930> with<00:01:24.979> several<00:01:25.979> other

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
used in combination with several other

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.620 
used in combination with several other
strokes<00:01:26.549> which<00:01:26.820> we're<00:01:27.119> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.270> get<00:01:27.420> into

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
strokes which we're going to get into

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.190 
strokes which we're going to get into
later<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.439> series

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:32.200 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.660 

ankle<00:01:33.200> strokes<00:01:33.470> can<00:01:33.680> produce<00:01:33.860> both<00:01:34.190> legato

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
ankle strokes can produce both legato

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.360 
ankle strokes can produce both legato
and<00:01:34.970> staccato<00:01:35.060> tones<00:01:36.020> for<00:01:36.710> legato<00:01:37.040> tones

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
and staccato tones for legato tones

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.469 
and staccato tones for legato tones
you're<00:01:37.610> going<00:01:37.729> to<00:01:37.790> want<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.060> let<00:01:38.180> the<00:01:38.270> beater

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
you're going to want to let the beater

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.240 
you're going to want to let the beater
rebound<00:01:39.050> off<00:01:39.290> of<00:01:39.590> the<00:01:39.650> bass<00:01:39.830> drum<00:01:40.040> head<00:01:40.220> and

rebound off of the bass drum head and

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.070 
rebound off of the bass drum head and
for<00:01:40.970> staccato<00:01:41.300> tones<00:01:41.570> you're<00:01:41.750> going<00:01:41.870> to<00:01:41.930> bury

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:42.080 
for staccato tones you're going to bury

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.410 
for staccato tones you're going to bury
the<00:01:42.290> beater<00:01:42.500> or<00:01:42.740> leave<00:01:43.040> it<00:01:43.190> into<00:01:43.520> the<00:01:43.610> head<00:01:43.790> you
