00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.910
 how to download minecraft to the version 

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:10.700
 most recent possible 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.360
 good if you have already had 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.939
 micros but they were needed and I want 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.530
 Back to recover your files and them 

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:23.440
 I'm going to teach something they enter 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:28.260
 enter these pages that I will leave you in 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:31.920
 the description that says two place 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.200
 and microsoft for windows costs nothing 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.700
 like in this minecraft and can play 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 everything you have to play on servers 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:47.360
 has to download this and what I'm going 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:50.930
 to teach much later and more 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.630
 this first thing we need is not 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:01:00.110
 you need to winrar nothing alone 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.110
 that will be charged in two weeks 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.989
 put it on your desk or else if 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.380
 they want 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:11.560
 and opening them to me tells me that this 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:15.090
 location has a file with the same 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.440
 you will get a little chinito like this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:22.400
 they click 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.960
 double left click and it will appear 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.960
 something like that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:36.750
 what do you expect the touches a fracture 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.350
 If you have increased much this will disappear 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.800
 they do not need to put their accounts put 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:46.270
 anything 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.270
 and look what happens 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:54.060
 to have it without creating accounts with the 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:55.980
 Minecraft fabric puts on play off line 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.890
 out line 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:02.700
 it's a andreas the without servers I think I think 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.260
 I'm not sure and if you settle in 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.360
 preserves are going to have servers 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:09.229
 or if you want just like that without 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.770
 multiplayer 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:14.150
 you 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.990
 play off line or something like that 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.990
 Y 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:21.030
 and I can not, they will not be able to play in 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.480
 multiplayer because for that they need 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.920
 server 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.920
 and they have to put their body 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.130
 good to me to me if it gives me but capable that 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.640
 you are not 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.020
 and there you have 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.810
 If your minecraft right and right 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.990
 I say I have done and right to play what 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.020
