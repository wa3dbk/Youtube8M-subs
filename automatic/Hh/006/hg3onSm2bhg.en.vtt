 Although it's been a long time but a lot of cold, let's go out and give the engine time 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.009
 new peugeot 3008 to test it and tell you what our opinion is 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.400
 a very particular model for the brand for several reasons in the first place 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.810
 by the denomination for some years has reserved a new 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.630
 four-digit nomenclature with a central double zero for a range of 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:34.980
 second special vehicles is a vehicle 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.989
 distinctly untraditional because it is difficult framed in a segment of the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:40.729
 market 

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:45.509
 the brand says it's a crossover even though it had a lot of a minivan has 

00:00:45.509 --> 00:00:49.789
 much of a month per utility so it's not a compendium of several segments and 

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:52.789
 that's why it's difficult to fit into any one particular 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.980
 one of the highlights I particularly think goes through the 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.769
 engine 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.779
 because it is a very low displacement engine with a lot of power very 

00:01:03.779 --> 00:01:08.310
 good bull that has low turns we are talking about an engine of just one thousand 600 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.649
 cubic centimeters develops 156 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.740
 horsepower and torque 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.750
 from 240 metro minutes to only one thousand four hundred laps this makes it 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.920
 a very elastic motor and also 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.610
 with a six-speed box so the engine or you're going to be very rested in 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.570
 the route and that allows you to save fuel so you have an idea 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.110

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.020
 different surfaces such as a normal surface such as asphalt 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 sand snow obarrio i according to the modality that you election is going to

 thousand pesos and 157 thousand pesos the level of security is the same for both 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.110
 versions what differs is it the comfort equipment version

 premium adds for example some jokes like the panoramic roof and 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.340
 also with a new gerard display that is nothing more than an as if by a

 acrylic protruding from the steering column when you want to activate it and 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.110
