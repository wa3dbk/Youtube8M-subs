could<00:03:51.180> you<00:03:51.270> have<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.510> get<00:03:51.630> a<00:03:51.660> strumming

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:51.960 
could you have to get a strumming

00:03:51.960 --> 00:04:00.210 
could you have to get a strumming
pattern<00:03:52.290> that<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> goes

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.130 

and<00:04:01.000> you<00:04:01.120> can<00:04:01.240> do<00:04:01.330> that<00:04:01.480> but<00:04:01.600> if<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.810> want<00:04:01.990> all

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
and you can do that but if you want all

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.290 
and you can do that but if you want all
that<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.560> is<00:04:02.830> just<00:04:02.890> six<00:04:03.730> down<00:04:03.970> strums

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 
that is is just six down strums

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:05.940 
that is is just six down strums
emphasizing<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.260> first<00:04:05.560> and<00:04:05.860> the<00:04:05.920> third

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:05.950 
emphasizing the first and the third

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.800 
emphasizing the first and the third
beats<00:04:06.460> so<00:04:07.090> one<00:04:07.510> two<00:04:07.810> three<00:04:08.170> four<00:04:08.500> five<00:04:08.800> six<00:04:09.100> and

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
beats so one two three four five six and

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.660 
beats so one two three four five six and
you<00:04:10.810> hope<00:04:11.050> you<00:04:11.680> have<00:04:11.710> one<00:04:12.190> two<00:04:12.430> three<00:04:12.460> four

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
you hope you have one two three four

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:18.300 
you hope you have one two three four
five<00:04:13.120> six<00:04:13.300> for<00:04:14.020> each<00:04:14.260> beats<00:04:14.710> so<00:04:15.400> 1<00:04:16.030> 2<00:04:16.360> 3<00:04:16.390> 5<00:04:17.320> 6<00:04:17.380> 2<00:04:17.980> 2

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
five six for each beats so 1 2 3 5 6 2 2

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:26.580 
five six for each beats so 1 2 3 5 6 2 2
3<00:04:18.640> 5<00:04:19.269> 6<00:04:19.570> 3<00:04:19.870> 2<00:04:20.230> 3<00:04:20.260> 3<00:04:20.769> 5<00:04:21.220> 6<00:04:21.519> 1<00:04:21.910> 2<00:04:21.970> 3<00:04:22.480> 5<00:04:23.200> 6<00:04:25.590> strumming

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
3 5 6 3 2 3 3 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 strumming

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.260 
3 5 6 3 2 3 3 5 6 1 2 3 5 6 strumming
pattern<00:04:26.920> like<00:04:27.250> instead<00:04:27.550> of<00:04:27.610> just<00:04:27.730> on<00:04:28.000> strands

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
pattern like instead of just on strands

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.330 
pattern like instead of just on strands
I<00:04:28.420> meant<00:04:28.810> I<00:04:28.900> would<00:04:29.410> recommend<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.950> sounds<00:04:30.190> like

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
I meant I would recommend it sounds like

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:43.899 
I meant I would recommend it sounds like
this

00:04:43.899 --> 00:04:43.909 

00:04:43.909 --> 00:04:47.959 

so<00:04:44.909> what<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.240> is<00:04:45.710> it's<00:04:46.710> a<00:04:46.949> Down<00:04:47.159> strum<00:04:47.520> and

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:47.969 
so what that is it's a Down strum and

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:51.379 
so what that is it's a Down strum and
then<00:04:48.780> down<00:04:49.169> up<00:04:49.319> down<00:04:49.590> up<00:04:49.650> so<00:04:50.460> you<00:04:50.550> have<00:04:50.610> down

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:51.389 
then down up down up so you have down

00:04:51.389 --> 00:04:54.350 
then down up down up so you have down
down<00:04:51.990> up<00:04:52.020> down<00:04:52.529> up<00:04:52.860> you<00:04:53.819> should<00:04:53.969> put<00:04:54.090> around<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
down up down up you should put around a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.790 
down up down up you should put around a
bit<00:04:54.509> you<00:04:54.539> know<00:04:54.629> practice<00:04:54.990> it<00:04:55.110> but<00:04:55.469> we<00:04:55.620> do<00:04:55.740> you

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
bit you know practice it but we do you

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.260 
bit you know practice it but we do you
should<00:04:56.009> play<00:04:56.129> that<00:04:56.159> one<00:04:56.430> at<00:04:56.580> twice<00:04:56.819> for<00:04:57.240> each

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:57.270 
should play that one at twice for each

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:11.730 
should play that one at twice for each
chord<00:04:57.629> so<00:04:58.289> down

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.350 

okay<00:05:12.740> and<00:05:13.100> then<00:05:13.400> so<00:05:13.730> your<00:05:13.880> second<00:05:14.240> core

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:14.360 
okay and then so your second core

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.180 
okay and then so your second core
pattern<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.900> the<00:05:15.380> one<00:05:15.560> that's<00:05:15.740> in<00:05:15.890> the<00:05:15.950> bridge

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
pattern is the one that's in the bridge

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.780 
pattern is the one that's in the bridge
so<00:05:16.670> this<00:05:17.000> chord<00:05:17.300> pattern<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.990> random<00:05:18.920> so<00:05:19.730> you

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
so this chord pattern is random so you

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.270 
so this chord pattern is random so you
have<00:05:20.150> an<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.450> minor<00:05:22.120> then<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.150> see

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
have an a minor then a see

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:29.820 
have an a minor then a see
then<00:05:25.280> another<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:25.940> minor<00:05:27.010> then<00:05:28.010> an<00:05:28.190> E<00:05:28.460> minor

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:29.830 
then another a minor then an E minor

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.790 
then another a minor then an E minor
then<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:31.010> have<00:05:31.160> once<00:05:31.520> again<00:05:31.790> a<00:05:32.090> minor<00:05:32.810> then<00:05:33.410> an

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
then you have once again a minor then an

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:39.220 
then you have once again a minor then an
E<00:05:34.070> minor<00:05:34.810> and<00:05:35.810> then<00:05:36.200> you<00:05:36.260> have<00:05:36.380> a<00:05:36.410> seat<00:05:38.050> and<00:05:39.050> you

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:39.230 
E minor and then you have a seat and you

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:41.680 
E minor and then you have a seat and you
hold<00:05:39.440> each<00:05:39.680> of<00:05:39.890> those<00:05:40.040> four<00:05:40.520> a<00:05:40.550> four<00:05:40.790> one<00:05:41.450> two

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
hold each of those four a four one two

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.110 
hold each of those four a four one two
three<00:05:42.020> four<00:05:42.290> five<00:05:42.530> six<00:05:42.770> apart<00:05:43.460> from<00:05:43.760> the<00:05:43.880> last

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
three four five six apart from the last

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.110 
three four five six apart from the last
C<00:05:44.360> which<00:05:45.080> you<00:05:45.290> hold<00:05:45.470> like<00:05:46.370> twice<00:05:46.700> that<00:05:46.910> thing

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
C which you hold like twice that thing

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.050 
C which you hold like twice that thing
so<00:05:47.840> basically<00:05:48.380> like<00:05:48.530> he<00:05:48.830> counts<00:05:49.130> twelve<00:05:49.400> so<00:05:49.940> on

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
so basically like he counts twelve so on

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:53.020 
so basically like he counts twelve so on
that<00:05:50.210> last<00:05:50.360> C<00:05:50.570> one<00:05:51.320> two<00:05:51.680> three<00:05:52.040> four<00:05:52.370> five<00:05:52.730> six

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.030

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:55.900 
that last C one two three four five six
two<00:05:53.360> two<00:05:53.720> three<00:05:53.990> four<00:05:54.350> five<00:05:54.650> six<00:05:54.920> or<00:05:55.640> you<00:05:55.790> know

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
two two three four five six or you know

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.310

whatever<00:05:58.910> way<00:05:58.970> you<00:05:59.030> will<00:05:59.150> do<00:05:59.270> it<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.570> doesn't

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
whatever way you will do it it doesn't

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.850 
whatever way you will do it it doesn't
bother<00:05:59.900> me<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:01.960> I'm<00:06:02.960> once<00:06:03.230> again<00:06:03.470> that<00:06:03.620> same

00:06:03.850 --> 00:06:03.860 
bother me so I'm once again that same

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.520 
bother me so I'm once again that same
strumming<00:06:04.190> pattern<00:06:04.550> so<00:06:05.270> that<00:06:05.600> chord<00:06:06.170> pattern

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:06.530 
strumming pattern so that chord pattern

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:11.770 
strumming pattern so that chord pattern
was<00:06:06.770> a<00:06:06.920> minor<00:06:07.420> C<00:06:08.420> then<00:06:09.350> a<00:06:09.770> minor<00:06:10.070> E<00:06:10.520> minor<00:06:11.090> a

00:06:11.770 --> 00:06:11.780 
was a minor C then a minor E minor a

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:17.680 
was a minor C then a minor E minor a
minor<00:06:12.710> E<00:06:13.220> minor<00:06:14.200> C<00:06:15.200> for<00:06:15.590> twelve<00:06:15.830> beats<00:06:16.330> so<00:06:17.330> from

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:17.690 
minor E minor C for twelve beats so from

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:21.750 
minor E minor C for twelve beats so from
the<00:06:17.810> beginning<00:06:18.140> you<00:06:18.380> have<00:06:18.410> je<00:06:18.980> d<00:06:19.760> e<00:06:20.180> minor<00:06:20.750> C

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
the beginning you have je d e minor C

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:33.290 
the beginning you have je d e minor C
down<00:06:22.760> down<00:06:23.330> up<00:06:23.360> down<00:06:23.570> up<00:06:23.870> down

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.610 

then<00:06:33.569> you<00:06:33.659> have<00:06:33.810> the<00:06:33.960> little<00:06:34.050> ran<00:06:34.349> to<00:06:34.530> be

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
then you have the little ran to be

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.619 
then you have the little ran to be
pretty<00:06:34.919> bit<00:06:35.220> obviously<00:06:35.909> not<00:06:36.120> after<00:06:36.389> like<00:06:36.509> the

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
pretty bit obviously not after like the

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:39.439 
pretty bit obviously not after like the
bus<00:06:36.780> but<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.229> comes<00:06:37.409> after<00:06:37.560> like<00:06:38.520> the<00:06:38.550> second

00:06:39.439 --> 00:06:39.449 
bus but it comes after like the second
