we<00:01:02.109> just<00:01:02.320> kept<00:01:02.530> thinking<00:01:02.649> about<00:01:02.920> what<00:01:03.339> is<00:01:03.429> it

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
we just kept thinking about what is it

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.070 
we just kept thinking about what is it
what<00:01:03.789> would<00:01:03.879> it<00:01:03.969> really<00:01:04.119> be<00:01:04.239> like<00:01:04.479> if<00:01:04.720> this<00:01:04.869> guy

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.080 
what would it really be like if this guy

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.710 
what would it really be like if this guy
was<00:01:05.259> in<00:01:05.470> this<00:01:05.830> country<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.460> where<00:01:07.210> else<00:01:07.240> could

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
was in this country and where else could

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.870 
was in this country and where else could
he<00:01:07.780> go<00:01:08.080> in<00:01:08.409> this<00:01:08.799> country<00:01:09.159> and<00:01:09.189> what<00:01:09.399> sorts<00:01:09.759> of

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
he go in this country and what sorts of

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:11.820 
he go in this country and what sorts of
themes<00:01:10.299> and<00:01:10.600> backdrops<00:01:11.020> could<00:01:11.229> we<00:01:11.350> explore

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
themes and backdrops could we explore

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.190 
themes and backdrops could we explore
and<00:01:12.070> I<00:01:12.549> think<00:01:12.820> that<00:01:13.030> if<00:01:13.390> you<00:01:13.570> look<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
and I think that if you look to the

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.840 
and I think that if you look to the
history<00:01:14.530> of<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.890> the<00:01:15.159> films<00:01:15.460> that<00:01:15.520> Shane's

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
history of the the films that Shane's

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.740 
history of the the films that Shane's
written<00:01:16.270> and<00:01:16.990> he's<00:01:17.530> directed<00:01:18.299> there's<00:01:19.299> a<00:01:19.390> real

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
written and he's directed there's a real

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.289 
written and he's directed there's a real
there's<00:01:20.439> a<00:01:20.530> real<00:01:20.710> desire<00:01:21.159> for<00:01:21.850> me<00:01:21.970> just<00:01:22.240> as

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
there's a real desire for me just as

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:24.029 
there's a real desire for me just as
