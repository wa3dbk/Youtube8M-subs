00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:04.540 
definitely fits a zombie setting

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.600 
definitely fits a zombie setting
definitely<00:02:05.140> does<00:02:05.320> but<00:02:05.860> then<00:02:06.040> as<00:02:06.310> I<00:02:06.490> was

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
definitely does but then as I was

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.800 
definitely does but then as I was
playing<00:02:06.910> throughout<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.420> single-player

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
playing throughout the single-player

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.420 
playing throughout the single-player
mission<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.440> defector<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:08.920> started<00:02:09.310> to

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:09.430 
mission the defector I started to

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.430 
mission the defector I started to
realize<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:10.000> it<00:02:10.090> looked<00:02:10.240> very<00:02:10.540> very<00:02:10.960> similar

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
realize that it looked very very similar

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.070 
realize that it looked very very similar
to<00:02:11.470> the<00:02:11.680> zombie<00:02:12.070> map<00:02:12.220> beirut<00:02:12.760> very<00:02:13.600> similar

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
to the zombie map beirut very similar

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.960 
to the zombie map beirut very similar
and<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.320> actually<00:02:15.220> gave<00:02:15.370> me<00:02:15.430> the<00:02:15.610> idea<00:02:15.700> that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
and that actually gave me the idea that

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.520 
and that actually gave me the idea that
treyarch<00:02:16.480> might<00:02:16.660> not<00:02:16.840> even<00:02:16.990> want<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.380> do

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
treyarch might not even want to do

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.530 
treyarch might not even want to do
something<00:02:17.860> similar<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.370> a<00:02:18.520> previous<00:02:19.030> on<00:02:19.270> map

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
something similar to a previous on map

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.870 
something similar to a previous on map
right<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.560> I<00:02:20.590> kind<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.950> let<00:02:21.070> that<00:02:21.190> idea<00:02:21.520> slide<00:02:21.850> I

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
right so I kind of let that idea slide I

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.400 
right so I kind of let that idea slide I
forgot<00:02:22.420> about<00:02:22.660> it<00:02:22.720> then<00:02:22.990> a<00:02:23.020> couple<00:02:23.260> weeks

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
forgot about it then a couple weeks

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.200 
forgot about it then a couple weeks
passed<00:02:23.770> by<00:02:24.010> and<00:02:24.220> I<00:02:24.250> started<00:02:24.520> noticing<00:02:24.580> that

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:25.210 
passed by and I started noticing that

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.530 
passed by and I started noticing that
people<00:02:25.990> are<00:02:26.110> posting<00:02:26.290> videos<00:02:27.210> stories<00:02:28.210> about

the storyline in the zombie mode to tell
you<00:02:38.710> the<00:02:38.740> truth<00:02:39.070> I<00:02:39.250> don't<00:02:39.310> know<00:02:39.460> if<00:02:39.550> you<00:02:39.640> guys

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
you the truth I don't know if you guys

are<00:02:39.820> thinking<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.300> same<00:02:40.480> way<00:02:40.690> as<00:02:40.810> I<00:02:40.990> am<00:02:41.170> but<00:02:41.350> it

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
seems like everything after darice was

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.330 
seems like everything after darice was
much<00:02:43.420> more<00:02:43.630> complex<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.230> follow<00:02:44.500> but<00:02:45.220> the

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
much more complex to follow but the

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.220 
much more complex to follow but the
whole<00:02:45.460> time<00:02:45.730> travel<00:02:46.270> situation<00:02:46.450> being<00:02:46.990> thrown

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
into the storyline it just kind of made

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.760 
into the storyline it just kind of made
it<00:02:48.760> a<00:02:48.820> little<00:02:48.970> confusing<00:02:49.540> you<00:02:50.230> know<00:02:50.350> kind<00:02:50.680> of

it a little confusing you know kind of

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.470

might<00:03:10.990> give<00:03:11.170> us<00:03:11.320> a<00:03:11.350> new<00:03:11.560> story<00:03:11.920> line<00:03:11.980> because

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
might give us a new story line because

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.340 
might give us a new story line because
if<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.700> play<00:03:12.880> on<00:03:13.030> ascension<00:03:13.540> as<00:03:13.630> Dempsey<00:03:14.110> he

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
if you play on ascension as Dempsey he

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.530 
if you play on ascension as Dempsey he
yells<00:03:14.650> out<00:03:14.920> hey<00:03:15.220> Trey<00:03:15.730> are<00:03:15.910> can<00:03:16.120> you<00:03:16.150> give<00:03:16.360> us<00:03:16.450> a

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:16.540 
yells out hey Trey are can you give us a

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.540 
yells out hey Trey are can you give us a
new<00:03:16.660> storyline<00:03:17.230> he<00:03:17.860> says<00:03:18.160> something<00:03:18.520> like

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
new storyline he says something like

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.640 
new storyline he says something like
that<00:03:18.850> and<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.150> kind<00:03:19.420> of<00:03:19.480> think<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.840> that<00:03:20.470> is

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
that and I kind of think that that is

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.830 
that and I kind of think that that is
triarchs<00:03:21.070> way<00:03:21.220> of<00:03:21.340> saying<00:03:21.700> hey<00:03:22.300> you<00:03:22.360> know<00:03:22.570> we

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840

I'm going to definitely say that they
won't<00:04:02.380> only<00:04:02.830> because<00:04:02.950> the<00:04:03.430> space<00:04:03.670> month<00:04:03.970> you

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
won't only because the space month you

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:05.550

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
seem like the only meant for ascension

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.830 
seem like the only meant for ascension
because<00:04:06.040> as<00:04:06.280> we<00:04:06.940> all<00:04:06.970> know<00:04:07.270> if<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.570> look<00:04:07.720> at

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
because as we all know if you look at

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.509 
because as we all know if you look at
ascension<00:04:08.320> it's<00:04:08.500> definitely<00:04:08.890> a<00:04:08.950> space-themed

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
ascension it's definitely a space-themed

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.980 
ascension it's definitely a space-themed
map<00:04:09.900> definitely<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.959> space-themed<00:04:11.500> map

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
map definitely a space-themed map

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.410 
map definitely a space-themed map
so<00:04:12.560> to<00:04:12.680> put<00:04:12.860> space<00:04:13.220> monkeys<00:04:13.670> in<00:04:13.820> another's<00:04:14.210> on

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:14.420 
so to put space monkeys in another's on

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.000 
so to put space monkeys in another's on
the<00:04:14.540> map<00:04:14.720> that<00:04:14.930> has<00:04:14.990> a<00:04:15.170> totally<00:04:15.680> different

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:16.010 
the map that has a totally different

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.890 
the map that has a totally different
setting<00:04:16.370> I<00:04:16.550> don't<00:04:17.180> think<00:04:17.209> it's<00:04:17.450> going<00:04:17.600> to<00:04:17.690> mix

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
setting I don't think it's going to mix

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.050 
setting I don't think it's going to mix
well<00:04:18.140> so<00:04:18.860> this<00:04:19.010> is<00:04:19.160> what<00:04:19.340> I<00:04:19.370> think<00:04:19.730> it's<00:04:19.880> god

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
well so this is what I think it's god

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.940
