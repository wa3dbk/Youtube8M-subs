00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 it must already enter the store abdallah 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.620
 for one thing and would come out with 22 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.559
 have you already marked the no kids 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.059
 cosmetics we can find there 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:19.920
 me yes and I have always been curious 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:22.310
 try the bike but left questions 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:26.390
 does it send 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.390
 but that's what we will discover 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.680
 and so first product we try 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.480
 today the baby cream or if you 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.870
 prefer perfecting your course 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.880
 11:25 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.370
 so today I took it there when 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:06.010
 medium what can be said about product 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:08.440
 it's that these facts a dog smells 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:14.050
 when will contain the hands that 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:16.259
 we bb regular cream it's also the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.259
 team 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.250
 I make half of my face with my 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.250
 fingers and the other half lived the pages 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.430
 I can tell you already that it's nice 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:38.000
 treatment 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:41.560
 without painting or texture 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.550
 not sure if I made the wrong password 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.870
 but it gives me a bit of a black theme 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.870
 we'll see it's worth it to oxidize 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.880
 Lombard is really unpleasant 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.520
 it seems a little thick for a baby 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.520
 cream 

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.640
 I will add a second layer on 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.640
 my cheeks 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.599
 like at home normally 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.090
 good 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.799
 so 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.360
 here is my quÃ© pantois 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:50.050
 I 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.050
 e 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.260
 and 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.730
 I add a second layer are my 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:24.740
 play 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:27.570
 There you go 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.030
 so we'll wait for it to dry in 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:33.540
 do not say it's an accident and I 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.290
 come back in a few minutes good then 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:38.780
 it's been about five minutes since bb 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.940
 cream and on my face 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:44.750
 what I did I feel like a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.220
 mold the meauffe in agree board and 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.770
 provoked me I have mixed skin that's 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:51.480
 really kohler 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.310
 I do not like it at all but must say that 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.820
 I have not put powder still to 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:59.220
 fix everything attacking it would help second 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:03.420
 luck and color I do not consider myself 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:05.820
 like the most tanned girls then 

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.980
 I took out the medium agreement I 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.370
 really think it's not so 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:15.290
 you see my neck the ghost look it's 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.549
 very little for me 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.430
 the author or his third thing that 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:23.750
 I really did not like it's the smell 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:25.040
 have the impression of berry or latex 

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.200
 simple m 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.890
 but so is what you buy is what 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.120
 let pass 

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:38.529
 the bb cream of the mom ben you'll get it 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:40.529
 Guessed I let me think - me me 

00:04:38.529 --> 00:04:40.529
 and 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.150
 that he 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.710
 all 

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:42.720
 or 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:47.830
 than 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.830
 gap 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:55.350
 garages
