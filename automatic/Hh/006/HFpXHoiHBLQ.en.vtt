know this is really one of the new
appliances<00:00:27.240> I<00:00:27.990> think<00:00:28.289> it's<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.619> word<00:00:28.830> premiere

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
appliances I think it's a word premiere

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.569 
appliances I think it's a word premiere
this<00:00:29.490> Saturday<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.210> HSN<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.619> developed<00:00:32.189> it<00:00:32.340> for

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
this Saturday on HSN we developed it for

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.819 
this Saturday on HSN we developed it for
two<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.210> half<00:00:33.570> years<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.320> know<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.530> have

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
two and half years you know you have

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.370 
two and half years you know you have
microwaves<00:00:35.520> out<00:00:35.760> there<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> have<00:00:36.390> pressure

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
microwaves out there you have pressure

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.100 
microwaves out there you have pressure
cookers<00:00:37.890> out<00:00:38.070> there<00:00:38.370> but<00:00:39.030> Devon<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.510> never<00:00:39.899> in

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
cookers out there but Devon was never in

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.780 
cookers out there but Devon was never in
an<00:00:40.230> oven<00:00:40.649> where<00:00:40.890> you<00:00:41.010> actually<00:00:41.399> could<00:00:41.610> go

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
an oven where you actually could go

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.819 
an oven where you actually could go
faster<00:00:42.300> if<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.510> turn<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> on<00:00:42.960> too<00:00:43.200> high<00:00:43.410> it

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
faster if you turn it on too high it

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.549 
faster if you turn it on too high it
burns<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.370> put<00:00:44.579> too<00:00:44.789> low<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:45.120> takes<00:00:45.329> forever<00:00:45.600> so

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
burns to put too low it takes forever so

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:49.040 
burns to put too low it takes forever so
you<00:00:46.620> never<00:00:46.860> have<00:00:47.219> anything<00:00:47.579> right<00:00:48.030> so<00:00:48.329> now<00:00:48.629> we

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
you never have anything right so now we

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.819 
you never have anything right so now we
develop<00:00:49.620> this<00:00:50.190> low<00:00:50.610> pressurized<00:00:51.829> countertop

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
develop this low pressurized countertop

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.819 
develop this low pressurized countertop
oven<00:00:53.370> where<00:00:54.000> you<00:00:54.180> can<00:00:54.420> cook<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.960> 12<00:00:55.530> pound

would say you know brine the chicken for
a<00:03:19.710> little<00:03:20.010> bit<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:20.490> that<00:03:20.520> way<00:03:20.760> it<00:03:20.820> gets<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
a little bit so that way it gets a

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:23.570 
a little bit so that way it gets a
little<00:03:21.360> juicier<00:03:21.810> but<00:03:22.110> not<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.740> this<00:03:22.920> oven<00:03:23.280> you

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
little juicier but not in this oven you

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.210 
little juicier but not in this oven you
don't<00:03:23.760> need<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.150> brine<00:03:24.450> it<00:03:24.690> because<00:03:25.110> all<00:03:25.530> the

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
don't need to brine it because all the

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.000 
don't need to brine it because all the
juices<00:03:26.880> are<00:03:27.330> sealed<00:03:27.750> in<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.350> you<00:03:28.500> can<00:03:28.710> see<00:03:28.890> how

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
juices are sealed in and you can see how

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:31.850 
juices are sealed in and you can see how
beautiful<00:03:29.550> Brown<00:03:29.880> the<00:03:30.180> chicken<00:03:30.210> is<00:03:30.780> so<00:03:31.620> it

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
beautiful Brown the chicken is so it

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.130 
beautiful Brown the chicken is so it
stays<00:03:32.190> juicy<00:03:32.490> because<00:03:33.030> it<00:03:33.240> doesn't<00:03:33.660> cook<00:03:33.870> in

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
stays juicy because it doesn't cook in

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.100 
stays juicy because it doesn't cook in
dry<00:03:34.440> heat<00:03:34.740> it<00:03:34.980> cooks<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.610> moisturized<00:03:36.480> heat<00:03:36.750> so

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
dry heat it cooks in moisturized heat so

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.340 
dry heat it cooks in moisturized heat so
and<00:03:37.380> then<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.310> oil<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:39.270> fat<00:03:39.480> which<00:03:39.810> is<00:03:39.840> around

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
and then the oil and fat which is around

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.410 
and then the oil and fat which is around
it's<00:03:40.680> like<00:03:40.800> self-pacing<00:03:41.580> so<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.060> makes<00:03:42.270> it

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
it's like self-pacing so it makes it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:46.220 
it's like self-pacing so it makes it
