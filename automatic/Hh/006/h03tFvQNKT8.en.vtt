00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.110
 the skeleton provides support for the 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.990
 body and protects the main and 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.299
 delicate internal organs at birth 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.799
 children have about 350 bones 

00:00:12.299 --> 00:00:15.600
 individual 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.850
 most of them are merging to 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:21.570
 grow a normal adult has 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:24.120
 approximately 206 bones the skull at 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.880
 principle consists of 26 separate bones 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.220
 in the child they are joined by membranes 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.950
 cartilaginous and flexible calls 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:34.230
 fontanelas these membranes are going or cif 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.929
 and forming the rigid sutures of the 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.149
 adult skull skull bones 

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:41.239
 they provide a solid protection for 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.379
 the brain and other sensitive organs 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 they are connected to the column 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:49.229
 composed of 33 small bones and 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.059
 irregularities that form the vertebrae are 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:54.030
 can say that the column is the pillar 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.559
 main body in it are anchored 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.229
 directly and indirectly others 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.659
 bones each bone has a shape and 

00:00:58.229 --> 00:01:02.819
 Special size depending on work 

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:05.970
 you have to perform and your position 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.409
 the spine fixes the 12 pairs 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.390
 of ribs 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.280
 and the rib cage formed by the 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.399
 ribs protects vital organs 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.429
 They are strong but flexible adapting to 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.289
 the shape of the lungs when breathing 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:21.119
 arms and his bones are one of the most 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:24.179
 exquisite engineering works that 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.670
 they know the complex articulations of 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.099
 The elbow and shoulder hand are worthy of 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.049
 admiration since they allow a great 

00:01:29.099 --> 00:01:34.560
 variety of movements from the most 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:37.229
 wide until the most meticulous together with 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.880
 the 26 bones of the hand the arm is 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.390
 prepared to perform any 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.709
 movement and manipulation the pelvis is 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.560
 located at the base of the column 

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:48.989
 vertebral connects the legs with the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.479
 rest of the skeleton the legs are the 

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:53.489
 bones that support the body are much 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:56.129
 longer and stronger than the bones of the 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:59.429
 arm the bone of the femur is the longest 

00:01:56.129 --> 00:02:02.700
 of the entire human body each foot is 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.829
 composed of 26 bones these allow 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.899
 a wide range of flexible movements 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.899
 while can withstand weight 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.810
 incredible about them the sole 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.640
 of an adult supports about 42 kilograms 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.490
 per square centimeter 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.440
 in each upright stride the weight is 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.170
 distributes evenly throughout the 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.990
 half of the weight is sent to the 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.360
 calcaneus in the heel and the other half goes 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.790
 to the tarsus bones that make up the 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:33.560
 arch of the foot the bones are 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.560
 perfectly designed for your work
