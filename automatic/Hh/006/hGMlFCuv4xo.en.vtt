 This time because is the Yes Eman I think that it has introduced the I Aikatsu-related goods 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.980
 This time it's been a long time, I'm related to Aikatsu 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:20.100
 It's been a while, but I think I will do it

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.780
 Separately 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 Continuous hinge 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:33.450
 It's not a song with a picture taken 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:38.310
 The required that I criticized rice was it in I think I comeｰｰｰｰis little that hen 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:41.970
 I'll play with the fake counter for a moment so now 

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:45.730
 Array after a long time in such like do you fight with the criticism rice 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.690
 I'm going to do it for a while 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:49.380
 Well 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.350

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.920
 Toei 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.760
 I think this is the first one of the second one 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.780
 I of the second series 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.780

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.590
 Tamer air noise seal 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.280
 Reason for opening 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.560
 As there is not particularly good point 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:33.700

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.539
 It is a binder 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:48.690
 It is probably the rest of the town that the pore city high using binder has not changed much 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:54.140
 Well at the time I was filming that I increased that one 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.140

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.160
 Per brand 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:20.750
 It is divided 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:26.350
 It's a Kirk that loves anything if it only stains 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.350
 PlayStation back is to say how Tokuda has become this kind of leather 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.510
 Some of you may have noticed the card you saw earlier , but there is one more item 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.080

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.569

 Without doing at all I did I choose because I'm a child of the time 4 bullets 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:43.000
 There is only a little bit of a card 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.470
 Miscalculation is a fact 

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.400
