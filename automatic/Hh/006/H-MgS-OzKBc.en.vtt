00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.100 

so<00:00:35.340> like<00:00:35.489> I<00:00:35.640> said<00:00:35.700> event<00:00:36.210> photography<00:00:36.720> isn't

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
so like I said event photography isn't

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.569 
so like I said event photography isn't
the<00:00:37.200> most<00:00:37.350> glorifying<00:00:37.920> thing<00:00:38.220> in<00:00:38.310> the<00:00:38.400> world

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
the most glorifying thing in the world

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.220 
the most glorifying thing in the world
but<00:00:38.820> there<00:00:38.970> are<00:00:39.000> so<00:00:39.360> many<00:00:39.600> different<00:00:40.020> things

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
but there are so many different things

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.010 
but there are so many different things
that<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.950> can<00:00:41.160> classify<00:00:41.390> events<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.900> know

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
that you can classify events you know

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.660 
that you can classify events you know

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
what are you doing essentially what is

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.220 
what are you doing essentially what is
the<00:00:44.820> main<00:00:45.030> goal<00:00:45.330> the<00:00:45.570> main<00:00:45.720> goal<00:00:45.900> is<00:00:45.989> really<00:00:46.140> to

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the main goal the main goal is really to

common question I get is like what gear
do<00:03:15.550> I<00:03:15.580> use<00:03:15.880> for<00:03:16.090> these<00:03:16.180> events<00:03:16.360> when<00:03:16.870> do<00:03:17.020> I<00:03:17.050> use

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
do I use for these events when do I use

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.530 
do I use for these events when do I use
these<00:03:17.530> types<00:03:17.800> of<00:03:17.950> gears<00:03:18.280> and<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:19.210> know<00:03:19.330> what

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
these types of gears and you know what

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.510 
these types of gears and you know what
kind<00:03:19.750> of<00:03:19.840> settings<00:03:20.260> do<00:03:20.440> I<00:03:20.470> use<00:03:20.800> going<00:03:21.040> into

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:21.520 
kind of settings do I use going into

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.700 
kind of settings do I use going into
these<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:21.970> essentially<00:03:22.750> what<00:03:23.080> I<00:03:23.110> shoot<00:03:23.590> with

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:23.710 
these and essentially what I shoot with

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.310 
these and essentially what I shoot with
is<00:03:23.920> my<00:03:24.070> Nikon<00:03:24.490> d700<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.630> I'm<00:03:25.780> always<00:03:26.050> on<00:03:26.260> the

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
is my Nikon d700 and I'm always on the

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:29.220 
is my Nikon d700 and I'm always on the
strap<00:03:26.740> it<00:03:27.040> really<00:03:27.880> really<00:03:28.390> takes<00:03:28.810> a<00:03:28.990> lot<00:03:29.200> of

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
strap it really really takes a lot of

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.140 
strap it really really takes a lot of
the<00:03:29.350> pressure<00:03:29.710> and<00:03:30.130> all<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.790> kind<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.030> stuff

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
the pressure and all that kind of stuff

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:32.850 
the pressure and all that kind of stuff
off<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.480> my<00:03:31.780> neck<00:03:31.840> and<00:03:32.380> it<00:03:32.470> really<00:03:32.650> just

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
off of my neck and it really just

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.550 
off of my neck and it really just
diverts<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.340> you<00:03:34.000> know<00:03:34.120> to<00:03:34.450> another<00:03:34.840> it<00:03:35.320> really

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
diverts it you know to another it really

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.280 
diverts it you know to another it really
just<00:03:35.740> alleviates<00:03:36.280> all<00:03:36.490> of<00:03:36.670> that<00:03:36.850> and

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just alleviates all of that and

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.200 
just alleviates all of that and
essentially<00:03:38.290> for<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:39.030> conference's<00:03:40.030> where

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
essentially for the conference's where

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.030 
essentially for the conference's where
you're<00:03:40.360> in<00:03:40.480> these<00:03:40.570> big<00:03:40.870> meeting<00:03:41.200> rooms<00:03:41.440> where

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
you're in these big meeting rooms where

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:43.920 
you're in these big meeting rooms where
you<00:03:42.130> have<00:03:42.340> you<00:03:42.490> know<00:03:42.610> the<00:03:42.790> bosses<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.420> CEOs

you have you know the bosses the CEOs
and<00:03:44.170> everything<00:03:44.500> like<00:03:44.620> that<00:03:44.680> I'm<00:03:45.460> using<00:03:45.730> my

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
and everything like that I'm using my

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.930

nikon 70 to 200 2.8 and I'm standing a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.700 
nikon 70 to 200 2.8 and I'm standing a
little<00:03:49.030> bit<00:03:49.240> further<00:03:49.480> back<00:03:49.750> clicking<00:03:50.560> them

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:50.710 
little bit further back clicking them

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.530 
little bit further back clicking them
off<00:03:50.890> you<00:03:51.160> know<00:03:51.280> you<00:03:51.730> know<00:03:51.820> going<00:03:52.030> regular

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:52.540 
off you know you know going regular

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.000 
off you know you know going regular
going<00:03:52.870> a<00:03:52.930> little<00:03:53.020> bit<00:03:53.230> of<00:03:53.350> vertical<00:03:53.710> all<00:03:53.860> that

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
going a little bit of vertical all that

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.830 
going a little bit of vertical all that
kind<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.280> stuff<00:03:54.400> just<00:03:54.910> to<00:03:55.000> change<00:03:55.300> things<00:03:55.660> up

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.170 
kind of stuff just to change things up
and<00:03:56.200> essentially<00:03:57.010> I<00:03:57.040> use<00:03:57.430> that<00:03:57.640> to<00:03:57.820> pick<00:03:58.000> off

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:58.180 
and essentially I use that to pick off

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.540 
and essentially I use that to pick off
the<00:03:58.480> other<00:03:59.200> people<00:03:59.590> in<00:03:59.680> the<00:03:59.770> crowd<00:04:00.040> and<00:04:00.430> you

know all that kind of stuff all those
types<00:04:02.200> of<00:04:02.350> candidates<00:04:02.770> but<00:04:03.190> when<00:04:03.340> you<00:04:03.430> get

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
types of candidates but when you get

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.570 
types of candidates but when you get
into<00:04:04.060> these<00:04:04.480> smaller<00:04:04.990> events<00:04:05.650> and<00:04:06.310> you<00:04:06.460> know

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:06.580 
into these smaller events and you know

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.430 
into these smaller events and you know
most<00:04:07.000> of<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.150> time<00:04:07.360> flash<00:04:07.690> photography<00:04:07.870> is

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
most of the time flash photography is

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.230 
most of the time flash photography is
I'm<00:04:08.590> allowed<00:04:08.890> I<00:04:09.220> could<00:04:09.820> find<00:04:10.000> that<00:04:10.120> out

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
I'm allowed I could find that out

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.900 
I'm allowed I could find that out
beforehand<00:04:10.870> you<00:04:11.170> know<00:04:11.290> for<00:04:12.280> these<00:04:12.430> some<00:04:12.880> of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
beforehand you know for these some of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.330 
beforehand you know for these some of
these<00:04:13.030> cases<00:04:13.510> you<00:04:13.630> know<00:04:13.720> people<00:04:14.080> cannot<00:04:14.500> deal

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
these cases you know people cannot deal

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.410 
these cases you know people cannot deal
with<00:04:15.370> flash<00:04:15.670> because<00:04:16.060> they<00:04:16.180> might<00:04:16.359> be

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
with flash because they might be

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:17.940 
with flash because they might be
epileptic<00:04:17.049> they<00:04:17.200> could<00:04:17.350> go<00:04:17.470> into<00:04:17.590> she's<00:04:17.920> a

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:17.950 
epileptic they could go into she's a

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:19.860 
epileptic they could go into she's a
seizure<00:04:18.460> all<00:04:18.940> that<00:04:19.210> kind<00:04:19.420> of<00:04:19.480> stuff<00:04:19.570> so<00:04:19.810> you

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
seizure all that kind of stuff so you

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:21.270 
seizure all that kind of stuff so you
have<00:04:20.140> to<00:04:20.320> make<00:04:20.470> sure<00:04:20.500> that<00:04:20.650> you<00:04:20.859> ask<00:04:21.010> that

have to make sure that you ask that

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:22.800 
have to make sure that you ask that
beforehand<00:04:21.940> you're<00:04:22.180> really<00:04:22.360> gonna<00:04:22.480> have<00:04:22.690> to

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
beforehand you're really gonna have to

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:24.540 
beforehand you're really gonna have to
ride<00:04:23.020> ISO<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.620> regard<00:04:23.920> step<00:04:24.160> but<00:04:24.310> I'll<00:04:24.370> cover

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
ride ISO and regard step but I'll cover

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:26.460 
ride ISO and regard step but I'll cover
all<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:24.850> in<00:04:24.940> a<00:04:25.000> second<00:04:25.450> but<00:04:25.960> out<00:04:26.140> you<00:04:26.380> know

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
all that in a second but out you know

that is the

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:01.459 
that is the
ultimate<00:05:00.629> goals<00:05:00.840> to<00:05:01.080> make<00:05:01.229> it<00:05:01.349> look

00:05:01.459 --> 00:05:01.469 
ultimate goals to make it look

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:03.320 
ultimate goals to make it look
interesting<00:05:01.650> to<00:05:02.129> look<00:05:02.340> fun<00:05:02.610> that<00:05:02.789> their<00:05:02.969> money

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:03.330 
interesting to look fun that their money

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.200 
interesting to look fun that their money
is<00:05:03.599> worth<00:05:04.349> something<00:05:04.979> you<00:05:05.550> know<00:05:05.699> at<00:05:05.909> these

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
is worth something you know at these

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:07.939 
is worth something you know at these
things<00:05:06.509> but<00:05:06.780> the<00:05:06.900> great<00:05:07.080> part<00:05:07.110> is<00:05:07.469> usually<00:05:07.680> if

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:07.949 
things but the great part is usually if

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.529 
things but the great part is usually if
you're<00:05:08.099> in<00:05:08.189> one<00:05:08.400> building<00:05:08.669> you<00:05:09.120> know<00:05:09.240> you're

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:09.539 
you're in one building you know you're

00:05:09.539 --> 00:05:11.059 
you're in one building you know you're
in<00:05:09.659> several<00:05:10.020> rooms<00:05:10.229> but<00:05:10.560> the<00:05:10.650> lighting<00:05:10.979> is

00:05:11.059 --> 00:05:11.069 
in several rooms but the lighting is

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:12.469 
in several rooms but the lighting is
pretty<00:05:11.250> much<00:05:11.430> always<00:05:11.669> the<00:05:11.819> same

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:12.479 
pretty much always the same

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.230 
pretty much always the same
so<00:05:12.870> I<00:05:13.199> actually<00:05:13.740> typically<00:05:14.520> I<00:05:14.550> shoot<00:05:14.849> on<00:05:14.969> auto

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
so I actually typically I shoot on auto

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.089 
so I actually typically I shoot on auto
white<00:05:15.539> balance<00:05:15.569> but<00:05:16.110> since<00:05:16.560> pretty<00:05:16.740> much<00:05:16.830> all

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
white balance but since pretty much all

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.469 
white balance but since pretty much all
the<00:05:17.219> lighting<00:05:17.460> is<00:05:17.610> typically<00:05:17.939> the<00:05:18.030> same<00:05:18.120> you

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
the lighting is typically the same you

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.240 
the lighting is typically the same you
know<00:05:18.509> in<00:05:18.780> one<00:05:18.930> location<00:05:19.289> to<00:05:19.530> another<00:05:19.680> in<00:05:20.159> the

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
know in one location to another in the

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:21.770 
know in one location to another in the
same<00:05:20.280> building<00:05:20.969> I<00:05:21.150> like<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.419> kind<00:05:21.659> of<00:05:21.719> just

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
same building I like to kind of just

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.510 
same building I like to kind of just
dial<00:05:22.139> it<00:05:22.349> in<00:05:22.469> so<00:05:22.620> that<00:05:22.650> way<00:05:22.889> it<00:05:23.129> takes<00:05:23.159> an

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
dial it in so that way it takes an

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.249 
dial it in so that way it takes an
easier<00:05:23.789> part<00:05:24.030> of<00:05:24.090> my<00:05:24.150> workflow<00:05:24.539> out<00:05:24.810> so<00:05:25.020> I<00:05:25.050> will

00:05:25.249 --> 00:05:25.259 
easier part of my workflow out so I will

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:28.279 
easier part of my workflow out so I will
use<00:05:25.650> a<00:05:25.680> custom<00:05:26.310> white<00:05:26.490> balance<00:05:26.930> usually<00:05:27.930> you

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
use a custom white balance usually you

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.899 
use a custom white balance usually you
know<00:05:28.409> it's<00:05:28.439> very<00:05:28.620> not<00:05:29.189> that<00:05:29.430> great<00:05:29.610> lighting

00:05:29.899 --> 00:05:29.909 
know it's very not that great lighting

00:05:29.909 --> 00:05:33.559 
know it's very not that great lighting
so<00:05:30.270> you<00:05:30.810> know<00:05:31.370> 3200<00:05:32.370> and<00:05:32.520> type<00:05:33.090> of<00:05:33.270> thing<00:05:33.419> is

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:33.569 
so you know 3200 and type of thing is

00:05:33.569 --> 00:05:34.730 
so you know 3200 and type of thing is
pretty<00:05:33.750> much<00:05:33.870> what<00:05:34.050> you're<00:05:34.169> going<00:05:34.289> to<00:05:34.349> be<00:05:34.500> at

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
pretty much what you're going to be at

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:36.709 
pretty much what you're going to be at
to<00:05:35.219> kind<00:05:35.460> of<00:05:35.520> alleviate<00:05:35.759> you<00:05:36.150> know<00:05:36.240> alleviate

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719 
to kind of alleviate you know alleviate

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.570 
to kind of alleviate you know alleviate
get<00:05:37.199> a<00:05:37.259> little<00:05:37.500> bit<00:05:37.590> maybe<00:05:37.800> the<00:05:38.009> green<00:05:38.250> out<00:05:38.430> all

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:38.580 
get a little bit maybe the green out all

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:39.950 
get a little bit maybe the green out all
the<00:05:38.669> kind<00:05:38.939> of<00:05:39.029> stuff<00:05:39.210> that<00:05:39.360> bounced<00:05:39.569> out<00:05:39.779> to

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
the kind of stuff that bounced out to

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.629 
the kind of stuff that bounced out to
make<00:05:40.080> it<00:05:40.229> easier<00:05:40.590> but<00:05:40.830> you're<00:05:41.189> going<00:05:41.310> to<00:05:41.370> be<00:05:41.490> at

make it easier but you're going to be at

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:43.760 
make it easier but you're going to be at
higher<00:05:41.879> ISO<00:05:42.479> so<00:05:42.840> don't<00:05:43.319> be<00:05:43.409> afraid<00:05:43.590> of

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
higher ISO so don't be afraid of

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.570 
higher ISO so don't be afraid of
throwing<00:05:43.919> your<00:05:44.039> camera<00:05:44.580> at<00:05:44.789> ISO<00:05:45.750> 1600<00:05:46.580> 2000

candidates<00:06:09.629> pick<00:06:10.110> off<00:06:10.289> the<00:06:10.469> speakers<00:06:10.889> you

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:11.789 
candidates pick off the speakers you

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:13.430 
candidates pick off the speakers you
know<00:06:11.879> typically<00:06:12.330> no<00:06:12.569> flash<00:06:12.900> but<00:06:13.139> if<00:06:13.199> there's<00:06:13.349> a

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
know typically no flash but if there's a

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.439 
know typically no flash but if there's a
flash<00:06:13.740> I<00:06:14.039> will<00:06:14.520> definitely<00:06:14.940> use<00:06:14.969> it<00:06:15.240> so<00:06:15.360> that

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
flash I will definitely use it so that

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:17.719 
flash I will definitely use it so that
way<00:06:15.569> I<00:06:15.599> can<00:06:15.839> use<00:06:16.050> lower<00:06:16.379> ISO<00:06:17.009> s<00:06:17.069> so<00:06:17.400> I<00:06:17.430> think<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
way I can use lower ISO s so I think I

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.219 
way I can use lower ISO s so I think I
pretty<00:06:17.879> much<00:06:18.000> covered<00:06:18.449> everything<00:06:18.539> in<00:06:19.050> that
