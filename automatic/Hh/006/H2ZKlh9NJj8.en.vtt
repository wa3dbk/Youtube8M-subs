00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.680
 let's copy the name of the file that 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 we want to change and we are going to add a 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.970
 1 at the end 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.400

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.290
 we want it to sound we're going to change the 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.540
 name and we're going to put the name that 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.270
 before, I had, for example, the 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.340
 champs the et bin peak is the 5 to 5 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:29.350
 normal says that I want to put it like that 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.360
 that I copied the 2.93 topic in the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.760
 folder that I have told you and changes the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.960
 name a sam zell &amp; blame peak 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.380
 just the name he had before and 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.030
 we would already be in to play he came to 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.680
 Custom zone because I will not play 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:47.430
 while this is just to show us 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.430
 create it and start we give it to each other 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.799
 ah 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.900
 and the great song is playing itself like me 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.729
 like this music I know 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.340
 if we want to change these changes that 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.200
 we have done since I do not like to have 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.970
 justino bieber sounding would always be so 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.149
 easy to remove the file that we have 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.970
 changed the name we removed it and at 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.100
 olympique 1 monkey goes whatever name it is 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:16.870
 let's remove the 1 and the 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.510
 reversed changes and it would sound again 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.860
