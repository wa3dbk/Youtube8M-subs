00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.730
 speak denied and quiet of denied beauty 

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:12.129
 because there is also Marcelo laughs 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.019
 and it is not good heaven next 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.630
 Today I'll explain to you how to run in 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:18.789
 reality a super tip whistle 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.599
 Attorney is what I want to lose. 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.980
 450 thousand and progressive until I go with 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:27.580
 flash and forgotten flash 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.249
 It was the best June fifa right now 

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:32.169
 It is as follows 450 000 and the Brazil 

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:33.600
 progressive silvio superdicas 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.510
 contributors 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:42.610
 You have a 1.6-gauge engine for 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.579
 example and suddenly you 're walking 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.670
 mouth begins to leak started to leak 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:50.980
 started to play what's going to be done here 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.079
 the takita side collector of the passenger 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.280
 and a turn it but you will see and measure 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:58.829
 There will be box for me to do is the following 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.920
 you looking sideways 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:06.060
 You'll see, so we have to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:10.509
 do here to take the cisco 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.380
 probably down here has a 

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.180
 screw 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.900
 this is the idle speed 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.259
 idle carburetor for you 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.420
 access to it the correct one would be like that you 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.689
 can not take it no lose, but 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:28.770
 The correct one would be to get you that way. 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:28.770
 from the gas director 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.200
 You take this care with care. 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.399
 not to fall into the engine on the ground 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.460
 and aside the beauty there is the way 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:46.079
 taking the path you have here condition 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.079
 to do this with the part laterally 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:54.909
 You'll find a way to loose this. 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:59.560
 Screw here you are seeing here today 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:02.380
 Car're slow on the farm will come out and 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.100
 It's going to be beauty, I'm doing it. I'm 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 with one hand only 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.459
 the nasdaq had computer now stayed 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:14.239
 It's easier just an Iraqi little thing here. 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.250
 so hitler direct and it will be like this here 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.770
 at the tip 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.790
 You can have a cisc in your stop here. 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.470
 at the tip 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.380
 another side that neither is here nor for 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:28.310
 example here is a little bit of the 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.930
 side is seeing the cisc portal on the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.890
 left and at the tip 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:36.110
 It's just you take it out here and blow it or 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.540
 pass a very thin line smaller than 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:41.630
 the diameter of the screw here is nothing 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.450
 hole taking ox kim can be here the 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.290
 idle problem as well but it is not 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.060
 that beauty slow motion problem 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.620
 Let's put it in the place. 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:58.760
 then again 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:03:01.790
 ok here the assembly is simple thing gives 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.010
 to do on the spot is a little chatinho you 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.750
 will have to be a key 8 is using a 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.180
 Cannon that is out of place can not 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.739
 use to win the key today you go 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.500
 let go of this one for the 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:14.660
 movement made the piece in place 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.870
 do not over- tighten the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:21.320
 bolts that it breaks, it's just 

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.190
 good if those then credit nodes 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.390
 slow running 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.200
 here below 22 screws and up here is 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.790
 of the player 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.709
 here you increase the amount of 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.390
 players you want when you 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.549
 pull is always faster unless 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:38.660
 accelerated 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.760
 this one is the axis of the patent you 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.709
 goes there or here 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.030
 some models like from my house by 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.680
 example it is here to escape 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:47.359
 hopscotch a ball 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.950
 This is a magnetic marelli in my 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.319
 face for yellow 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.519
 It may be that you increase a little here 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.920
 stay cool 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.090
 here is a tuning screw of the 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:58.489
 slow 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:00.100
 The correct thing is that I thought it was not 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.510
 taking the wheel bolts locked 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.459
 correct is you pull a screw 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.290
 little backward to turn 

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.329
 first you see if everything is to 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:11.569
 inside is all inside type 4 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.580
 I turned him four great back 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.500
 He's going to stay close to your band here. 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:19.130
 O 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:22.280
 Is not that right, here, then? 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.270
 recapitulate with the botafogo in the car 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.290
 suddenly started the fire was 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.410
 Perfect 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:28.520
 It may be here today that slow 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:31.190
 some risks 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.110
 You take off your hat with the slack it 's just you. 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.710
 take out the kitchen you took so stay 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.510
 the tip is to have no risk here 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.240
 Do you want to before you move here? 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.160
 more complicated to mess down here 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.740
 The one for the bar kitchen. 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:47.150
 you will squeeze a little bit not 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.040
 stopped 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.440
 Do you have a needle screw tuning? 

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.930
 Are you going to come back for a little bit? 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.850
 left anti-clockwise to 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:58.660
 have a turn behind or 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:05:01.400
 improved but did not have behind 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:04.730
 02 adjustments here slow 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.540
 are these for the strongest that is 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.160
 of the player 

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.530
 this screw down here is the 

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:11.780
 shaft stop here is now 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.840
 these three here will make the 

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:18.470
 regulation of slow and choking these two 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:21.770
 here is the height of the idle speed and 

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:22.479
 mixing the idle not resolved 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.000
 on here 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:28.220
 the defect will be down here will 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.460
 have to take that I did not here first 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:34.430
 Take this little thing here for you. 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:38.030
 get the cisco in there 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:40.190
 Okay, I do not know if it's cool for you. 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:43.190
 any doubt you look there you want 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:47.390
 a 450,000 progressive charger used 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:49.270
 the engine after 1.6 and 1.8 depending on the case then 

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:52.100
 depending on the head configuration 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.270
 very common in the Volkswagen line but 

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:58.400
 also used in chevette 1.4 tÃ¡ is e 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.890
 some models of cars that head there 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:04.490
 I'm remembered now but there's a chevette. 

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:09.290
 has in the wand and all 1.6 some 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.950
 models 1.800 program good 1.6 was 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:14.180
