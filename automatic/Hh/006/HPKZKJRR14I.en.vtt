00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 to do the manicure and we need one 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.870
 tray with hot water a little 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.900
 soap or small cutter one 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.590
 two-sided file 1 pushes cuticles into 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.289
 steel an orange stick one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.960
 reinforcing enamel or at least the base 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.359
 a colored nail polish a cream for the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.480
 hands and a little paper to dry the 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.340
 hands and now we can start like 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.500
 First we need to eliminate the enamel 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.590
 with solvent preferably without 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.840
 acetone and with a disk once 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.630
 we have eliminated the enamel we can 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.469
 move to filing the nail or cutting it 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.629
 if I wanted to cut them and use them 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.340
 one of these lines in carton with 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.860
 double-sided 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.370
 or you could use one of these 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.140
 steel or glass blades 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.390
 but I do not recommend it because they are a bit 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 too aggressive and tend to break 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 nails go with the climate of 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.690
 cartons and try to give it a shape 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.539
 square because in this in this 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.500
 period I don't want squares and notes 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:11.010
 I will try to file them like this and then ai 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.049
 angles I go a little bit so I'm going 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.900
 a little bit because I don't want too much 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:18.479
 too much the right angle and I always recommend 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.320
 to file and towards a sense like this 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:26.689
 otherwise if you do so always forward e 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.689
 back feel both to break long 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.930
 the shape we want to put a little 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.300
 of hand cream around the 

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:20.060
 cuticles immerse the hand in the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.060
 pan with hot water for 35 minutes 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:38.280
 time we have the Roman bases from the water 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.740
 we dry eliminate kyi followed by 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.500
 cream that remains and now we can 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:47.100
 push the cuticles and we can use a 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.790
 a tool of this kind that does it 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.700
 push cuticles or we can use 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.930
 try the orange owl he always has 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:03:00.290
 the same use we push into this 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.290
 way 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:07.319
 without making too much pressure because 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:07.319
 this area is very delicate dead 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:27.740
 and we try to push all the 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:33.130
 cuticles pushed the cuticles go 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:36.130
 with this other blade and we try to 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.130
 unseat 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.570
 let's always very much the way 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.270
 with nippers remove the hides in 

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:30.370
 excess the cuticles and remember that 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:32.590
 cuticles never cut but only the 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:50.259
 cuticles precisely because the cuticles 

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:51.729
 serve as protection of the real ha 

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:54.759
 having done this we can 

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:57.159
 check the filings and if it suits you 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.150
 we can move on to put the enamel 

00:04:57.159 --> 00:05:00.849
 transparent 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:20.800
 I use this kiko here that has one 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:22.930
 reinforcing base put the enamel 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:25.060
 without registering so I had to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.340
 detect from the last three fingers for 

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:29.919
 let you see so if I am a little 

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:31.960
 red and for that then once 

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:35.050
 the base dried out I know I put one 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.909
 colored enamel and use this of the pupa 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.909
 and at number 614 

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:48.210
 a trick to make it last longer 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:51.180
 put more product in the point I hope that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:59.570
 can you see then I put some 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:59.570
 more in point and then I go down 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:06.169
 and I do praise 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:08.509
 obviously if it is not perfect there is not 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:15.039
 worried because then with the second 

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:15.039
 so we arrange it more precisely 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.110
 go down to the side 

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:44.970
 the appearance that it dries and then I do 

00:06:42.450 --> 00:06:48.780
 the second pass now that I'm doing 

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:52.680
 the second pass I put on all the 

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:55.730
 nails 2 drops of these drops dry 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:55.730
 essence enamel 

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.490
 I polish the omitted and I also put the 

00:07:51.759 --> 00:07:56.919
 essence kitchens now I wait for you 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:59.710
 dry and we ended because 

00:07:56.919 --> 00:08:02.470
