00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.980
 hello youtube friends alejandro sean 

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:08.290
 welcome to this new video and if 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.059
 they are listening to a noise 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:12.370
 so medium rare is the fan 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.259
 that here is already starting to do what 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.449
 It's been the heat now 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.580
 going into summer and when we're in 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.920
 Summer gets pretty hot and it 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.779
 it makes all this fart well tasty but 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.789
 the channels first I want to send you a 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.440
 click greeting to this one meets that is called 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:28.750
 Kevin 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.910
 elizalde lopez that sent me this 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:33.340
 activity that is being very very 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.560
 similar to what is going to be the dlc of 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.329
 steal the bank as you can see we enter 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:41.129
 to the bank and we simply have to steal 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.620
 we have to steal what is being 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.289
 some bags very similar to what is going to 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.120
 be the dlc that comes in the future I do not know 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.399
 when they will take it out but it will be 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 I imagine that very soon this activity 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.589
 is identical identical it would seem very 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.449
 similar the only difference is that no 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.909
 we can enter the cellar where the 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.979
 box to the warehouse where the box is 

00:00:59.909 --> 00:01:03.869
 strong in the giant box that I give them 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.170
 I made a video of how to get in there 

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:09.149
 a long time but it is identical channels 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.950
 this mission is the same thing what 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:12.720
 same thing he's going to do to steal the bank 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.670
 so the only thing they have to do 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.200
 to get this activity what 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.899
 have to do is follow here below in 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.479

 what they have to do is click and we 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.299

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.820
 what is done playing with friends is 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.770

 sometimes biscuit transmission 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.790
 and the other 3 kings and the pig 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.750
 this mother is the same as going out to 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.750
 role of the bank 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:35.670
 it's about 22 in each van all 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.670
 the partners 

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:42.330
 but no 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.330
 but it 's like that 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:55.780
 ah 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.180
 Oh bugger at this point they gave me my 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.910
 condemned to see 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:03.910
 in photos where they got there clear 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.590
 to the mind 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.819
 we were entering the mother of all 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.950
 and good 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.950
 they do not want it 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.710
 I'm going to look at our theories more 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.710
 complete 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:35.230
 ah 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.590

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.590
 these are policemen 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:49.540
 good 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.000
 and then
