i'm going to pay just to help her

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.179 
i'm going to pay just to help her
understand<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.960> to<00:00:31.529> find<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> correct

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
understand and to find the correct

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.270 
understand and to find the correct
answer<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.030> just<00:00:33.719> move<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.140> here<00:00:34.350> even<00:00:35.160> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
answer so just move in here even that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.690 
answer so just move in here even that
little<00:00:35.340> thing<00:00:35.790> they<00:00:36.059> sway<00:00:36.870> back<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.350> body

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
little thing they sway back on a body

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.900 
little thing they sway back on a body
moving<00:00:38.700> overhead<00:00:39.320> that's<00:00:40.320> that's<00:00:41.040> that's<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
moving overhead that's that's that's a

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.610 
moving overhead that's that's that's a
start<00:00:42.210> anything<00:00:43.079> in<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> right<00:00:43.410> direction

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
start anything in the right direction

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.400 
start anything in the right direction
when<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.700> first<00:00:45.000> start<00:00:45.300> help<00:00:45.600> them<00:00:45.750> to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
when you first start help them to

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.340 
when you first start help them to
understand<00:00:47.039> and<00:00:47.539> once<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.690> do<00:00:48.750> understand

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
understand and once they do understand

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.709 
understand and once they do understand
then<00:00:49.559> we<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.800> start<00:00:50.100> nice<00:00:50.430> for<00:00:50.700> full<00:00:50.910> hog<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.480> I

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
then we can start nice for full hog so I

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.830 
then we can start nice for full hog so I
so<00:00:52.289> again<00:00:52.559> now<00:00:52.800> look<00:00:53.010> at<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.250> nose<00:00:53.600> this<00:00:54.600> my

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so again now look at the nose this my

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.590 
so again now look at the nose this my
energy<00:00:55.230> up<00:00:55.260> pushing<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.070> horse<00:00:56.399> eyes<00:00:57.270> get

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
energy up pushing on the horse eyes get

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.979 
energy up pushing on the horse eyes get
to<00:00:57.780> escape<00:00:58.199> away<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.370> if<00:00:59.699> the<00:01:00.149> mayor<00:01:00.390> backs<00:01:00.719> up

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
to escape away and if the mayor backs up

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.090 
to escape away and if the mayor backs up
what<00:01:01.440> she's<00:01:01.710> doing<00:01:01.980> here<00:01:02.010> now<00:01:02.399> if<00:01:03.329> I<00:01:03.600> stop<00:01:04.199> or

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
what she's doing here now if I stop or

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.510 
what she's doing here now if I stop or
pull<00:01:06.060> on<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.270> or<00:01:06.659> do<00:01:07.080> anything<00:01:07.260> about<00:01:07.439> it<00:01:07.619> then

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
pull on it or do anything about it then

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.100 
pull on it or do anything about it then
what<00:01:08.760> I've<00:01:08.909> done<00:01:09.090> is<00:01:09.330> all<00:01:09.479> of<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.720> question

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
what I've done is all of the question

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.649 
what I've done is all of the question
and<00:01:10.650> if<00:01:10.860> I<00:01:10.979> keep<00:01:11.220> all<00:01:11.400> of<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.670> question<00:01:12.030> she

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
and if I keep all of the question she

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.140 
and if I keep all of the question she
can<00:01:12.840> never<00:01:13.080> ever<00:01:13.260> find<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:13.770> answer<00:01:14.130> so<00:01:14.850> if

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
can never ever find the answer so if

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.719 
can never ever find the answer so if
when<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> mayor<00:01:15.689> backs<00:01:15.960> up<00:01:16.229> which<00:01:17.070> is<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
when the mayor backs up which is not the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.030 
when the mayor backs up which is not the
answer<00:01:17.820> i<00:01:18.090> want<00:01:18.330> for<00:01:18.570> what<00:01:18.780> i<00:01:18.810> need<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.170> do<00:01:19.470> is

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
answer i want for what i need to do is

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.910 
answer i want for what i need to do is
move<00:01:20.430> forward<00:01:20.689> so<00:01:21.689> I<00:01:21.720> stay<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.200> relationship

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
move forward so I stay in relationship

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.370 
move forward so I stay in relationship
to<00:01:22.950> her<00:01:23.130> exact<00:01:23.580> same<00:01:23.790> spot<00:01:24.030> keep<00:01:24.840> asking<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
to her exact same spot keep asking the

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.370 
to her exact same spot keep asking the
exact<00:01:25.799> same<00:01:26.040> question<00:01:26.750> to<00:01:27.750> my<00:01:27.930> mind<00:01:28.170> I'm

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
exact same question to my mind I'm

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.230 
exact same question to my mind I'm
saying<00:01:28.650> about<00:01:28.799> what's<00:01:29.100> two<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.400> two<00:01:29.579> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
saying about what's two and two the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.060 
saying about what's two and two the
answer<00:01:30.630> is<00:01:30.689> for<00:01:31.020> which<00:01:31.590> is<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> diagonal

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
answer is for which is a diagonal

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.520 
answer is for which is a diagonal
movement<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.909> way<00:01:33.119> she<00:01:33.840> backs<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.290> that's

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
movement that way she backs up that's

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
movement that way she backs up that's
five<00:01:34.799> I<00:01:35.070> don't<00:01:35.250> have<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.490> beat<00:01:35.640> her<00:01:35.759> up<00:01:35.909> for

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
five I don't have to beat her up for

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.630 
five I don't have to beat her up for
getting<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.420> wrong<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.900> just<00:01:37.500> seep<00:01:37.799> keep<00:01:38.189> asking

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
getting it wrong I just seep keep asking

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.120 
getting it wrong I just seep keep asking
a<00:01:38.700> question<00:01:39.060> what's<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.049> two<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:41.009> we'll

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
a question what's two and two so we'll

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.219 
a question what's two and two so we'll
ask<00:01:41.280> you<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:41.640> same<00:01:41.670> question<00:01:41.909> again<00:01:42.450> when<00:01:43.200> I

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
ask you that same question again when I

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.710 
ask you that same question again when I
do<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.799> what<00:01:44.490> you<00:01:44.700> should<00:01:44.909> do<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.299> take<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
do this what you should do is take that

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.850 
do this what you should do is take that
nose<00:01:46.020> and<00:01:46.380> put<00:01:47.220> it<00:01:47.250> over<00:01:47.490> there<00:01:48.500> they're<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
nose and put it over there they're a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.370 
nose and put it over there they're a
little<00:01:50.159> moving<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.729> right<00:01:50.880> direction<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> you

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
little moving the right direction so you

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.960 
little moving the right direction so you
