00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.300 
together so I realized they do step I
think<00:02:41.569> it's<00:02:41.689> deck<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.079> yeah<00:02:42.290> they<00:02:42.709> stack<00:02:43.099> and

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
think it's deck now yeah they stack and

think it's deck now yeah they stack and
I<00:02:43.430> was<00:02:43.579> like<00:02:43.700> oh<00:02:43.819> that's<00:02:44.180> perfect<00:02:44.510> that's

00:02:49.929 --> 00:02:49.939 
fifty eat salsa okay so then I figured

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.860

out about these little babies and they
stack<00:02:54.290> with<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.859> so<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:55.730> was<00:02:55.879> a<00:02:55.909> complete<00:02:56.090> must

00:02:56.679 --> 00:02:56.689 
stack with it so it was a complete must

00:02:56.689 --> 00:02:59.979 
stack with it so it was a complete must
I<00:02:56.870> was<00:02:57.169> going<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.680> make<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:59.299> dead<00:02:59.510> stacking

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.339 
I was going to make the dead stacking
stuff<00:03:00.169> just<00:03:00.379> as<00:03:00.500> bad<00:03:00.680> as<00:03:00.769> i<00:03:00.889> am<00:03:01.010> opening<00:03:01.519> things

mmm<00:03:03.349> I<00:03:04.180> don't<00:03:05.180> think<00:03:05.419> I<00:03:05.659> started<00:03:06.079> this

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169 
mmm I don't think I started this

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:08.440 
mmm I don't think I started this
correctly<00:03:06.650> right<00:03:06.919> now<00:03:07.099> but<00:03:07.430> it<00:03:07.849> looks<00:03:08.090> stacked

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
correctly right now but it looks stacked

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.899 
correctly right now but it looks stacked

so<00:04:11.889> earlier<00:04:12.889> I<00:04:13.220> was<00:04:13.430> thinking<00:04:13.939> about<00:04:14.269> oh<00:04:14.540> maybe

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:14.930 
so earlier I was thinking about oh maybe

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:16.719 
so earlier I was thinking about oh maybe
I<00:04:15.079> should<00:04:15.290> try<00:04:15.439> one<00:04:15.739> because<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.310> don't<00:04:16.549> wear

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
I should try one because I don't wear

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.509 
I should try one because I don't wear
eyelashes<00:04:17.659> and<00:04:17.780> I<00:04:17.840> probably<00:04:18.049> need<00:04:18.590> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
eyelashes and I probably need the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.839

then I end up taking one of them off and
then<00:04:32.180> I<00:04:32.240> was<00:04:32.330> like<00:04:32.389> let<00:04:32.629> me<00:04:32.659> just<00:04:32.750> take<00:04:32.930> both<00:04:33.110> of

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:35.920 
then I was like let me just take both of

them up so I took bottle mom and I end

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:37.899 
them up so I took bottle mom and I end
up<00:04:35.960> losing<00:04:36.409> one<00:04:36.560> of<00:04:36.590> them<00:04:36.800> fun<00:04:37.159> right<00:04:37.190> so<00:04:37.849> I'm

00:04:37.899 --> 00:04:37.909 
up losing one of them fun right so I'm

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:40.990 
up losing one of them fun right so I'm
not<00:04:38.150> wearing<00:04:38.569> them<00:04:38.659> right<00:04:38.690> now<00:04:38.930> one<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.159> style

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
not wearing them right now one of style

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.080 
not wearing them right now one of style
number<00:04:41.300> three<00:04:41.800> and<00:04:42.800> it's<00:04:43.340> another<00:04:43.550> cross<00:04:43.819> type

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
number three and it's another cross type

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.070 
number three and it's another cross type
i<00:04:44.409> believe<00:04:45.409> ya<00:04:46.099> cross<00:04:46.430> type<00:04:46.849> number<00:04:47.240> for<00:04:47.599> the

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
i believe ya cross type number for the

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.159 
i believe ya cross type number for the
style<00:04:48.349> for<00:04:48.560> it<00:04:48.949> is<00:04:49.280> longer<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.210> think<00:04:51.020> they're

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
style for it is longer I think they're

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.230 
style for it is longer I think they're
just<00:04:51.379> about<00:04:51.470> the<00:04:51.650> same<00:04:51.800> thickness<00:04:52.069> no<00:04:52.819> I<00:04:52.849> think

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
just about the same thickness no I think

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.909 
just about the same thickness no I think
cars<00:04:53.599> for<00:04:53.810> I<00:04:53.990> think<00:04:54.440> it's<00:04:54.560> a<00:04:54.620> little<00:04:54.770> bit

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:54.919 
cars for I think it's a little bit

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:56.800 
cars for I think it's a little bit
different<00:04:55.490> I<00:04:55.669> mean<00:04:56.180> they're<00:04:56.330> exactly<00:04:56.599> the

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
different I mean they're exactly the

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.439 
different I mean they're exactly the
same<00:04:56.870> but<00:04:57.610> cross<00:04:58.610> for<00:04:58.880> is<00:04:59.000> a<00:04:59.030> little<00:04:59.150> bit

00:04:59.439 --> 00:04:59.449 
same but cross for is a little bit

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:05.499 
same but cross for is a little bit
longer<00:04:59.659> that<00:05:00.050> is<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:03.849> other<00:05:04.849> looks<00:05:05.180> like<00:05:05.330> I

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:05.509 
longer that is the other looks like I

00:05:05.509 --> 00:05:08.110 
longer that is the other looks like I
came<00:05:05.930> in<00:05:06.050> a<00:05:06.110> pack<00:05:06.289> of<00:05:06.440> 2<00:05:06.680> to<00:05:07.069> set<00:05:07.310> and<00:05:07.520> their

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
came in a pack of 2 to set and their

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.540 
came in a pack of 2 to set and their
natural<00:05:08.389> emphasis<00:05:09.020> in<00:05:09.259> style<00:05:09.800> for<00:05:10.280> and

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:10.550 
natural emphasis in style for and

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:13.420 
natural emphasis in style for and
they're<00:05:11.509> also<00:05:11.719> another<00:05:12.110> cross<00:05:12.409> type<00:05:12.710> I<00:05:12.889> almost

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
they're also another cross type I almost

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.520 
they're also another cross type I almost
think<00:05:13.940> they<00:05:14.210> look<00:05:14.360> exactly<00:05:14.479> like<00:05:14.960> the<00:05:15.349> cross

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:15.530 
think they look exactly like the cross

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.279 
think they look exactly like the cross
type<00:05:15.800> for<00:05:16.130> on<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.490> other<00:05:16.639> one<00:05:16.849> but<00:05:17.659> maybe<00:05:18.080> it's

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:18.289 
type for on the other one but maybe it's

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.070 
type for on the other one but maybe it's
a<00:05:18.469> little<00:05:18.590> bit<00:05:18.860> different<00:05:19.250> I<00:05:19.900> they<00:05:20.900> look

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:21.080 
a little bit different I they look

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.450 
a little bit different I they look
exactly<00:05:21.259> the<00:05:21.560> same<00:05:21.650> to<00:05:21.830> me<00:05:21.919> so<00:05:22.159> I<00:05:22.219> probably

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:22.460 
exactly the same to me so I probably

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.290 
exactly the same to me so I probably
just<00:05:22.969> got<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:24.370> bunch<00:05:25.370> of<00:05:25.520> different<00:05:25.909> pairs<00:05:26.090> the

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
just got a bunch of different pairs the

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.990 
just got a bunch of different pairs the
same<00:05:26.509> exact<00:05:26.840> one<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.530> last<00:05:27.830> ones<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.370> got<00:05:28.610> they

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.000 
same exact one the last ones I got they

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.330 
same exact one the last ones I got they
are<00:05:29.300> exclusively<00:05:30.199> for<00:05:30.319> bottom<00:05:30.800> lashes<00:05:30.979> it's
