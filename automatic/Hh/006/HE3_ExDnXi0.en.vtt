00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
across like the most ideal situation you

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.449 
across like the most ideal situation you
can<00:03:59.150> play<00:03:59.329> up<00:03:59.360> to<00:03:59.510> four<00:03:59.600> people<00:04:00.200> going<00:04:01.040> across

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:03.350 
in the table so what happens is balls

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.720 
in the table so what happens is balls
start<00:04:03.650> colliding<00:04:03.920> with<00:04:04.190> each<00:04:04.310> other<00:04:04.519> and
