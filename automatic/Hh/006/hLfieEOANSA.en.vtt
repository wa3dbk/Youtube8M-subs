innovation Channel as you can see we got
another<00:00:15.509> door<00:00:15.809> for<00:00:15.839> you<00:00:16.170> guys<00:00:16.379> this<00:00:16.859> one<00:00:17.070> is<00:00:17.220> a

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
another door for you guys this one is a

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.060 
another door for you guys this one is a
button<00:00:17.730> activated<00:00:18.240> 3x3<00:00:18.900> and<00:00:19.020> we're<00:00:19.890> really

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
button activated 3x3 and we're really

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.480 
button activated 3x3 and we're really
excited<00:00:20.279> to<00:00:20.640> release<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.090> here<00:00:21.600> it<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.810> opening

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
excited to release it here it is opening

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.960 
excited to release it here it is opening
its<00:00:23.490> pretty<00:00:23.760> fast<00:00:24.060> it's<00:00:24.449> not<00:00:24.630> too<00:00:24.779> shabby<00:00:24.990> and

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:25.970 
its pretty fast it's not too shabby and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.339 
its pretty fast it's not too shabby and
then<00:00:26.970> closed<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.539> looks<00:00:27.779> like<00:00:27.960> that

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
then closed it looks like that

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.500 
then closed it looks like that
all<00:00:29.250> right<00:00:29.429> so<00:00:29.640> let's<00:00:29.910> just<00:00:29.970> go<00:00:30.210> ahead<00:00:30.300> and

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
all right so let's just go ahead and

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.770 
all right so let's just go ahead and
look<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.779> wiring<00:00:30.960> I<00:00:31.199> suppose<00:00:35.570> okay

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
look at the wiring I suppose okay

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.840 
look at the wiring I suppose okay
so<00:00:37.410> here's<00:00:37.620> all<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.890> wiring<00:00:38.070> as<00:00:38.430> you<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.700> see

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so here's all the wiring as you can see

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.260 
so here's all the wiring as you can see
it's<00:00:39.000> very<00:00:39.210> compact<00:00:40.340> it's<00:00:41.340> quite<00:00:41.940> a<00:00:41.969> bit<00:00:42.149> more

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it's very compact it's quite a bit more

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.720 
it's very compact it's quite a bit more
compact<00:00:42.450> in<00:00:42.809> our<00:00:42.930> last<00:00:43.110> design<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:44.430> orange

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
compact in our last design the orange

retraction red as our input and blue
leads<00:00:53.430> power<00:00:53.699> all<00:00:53.940> the<00:00:54.090> way<00:00:54.120> around<00:00:54.890> now

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
leads power all the way around now

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
leads power all the way around now
quickly<00:00:56.190> what<00:00:56.489> I<00:00:56.520> want<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.789> point<00:00:57.000> out<00:00:57.239> before

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
quickly what I want to point out before

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.349 
quickly what I want to point out before
any<00:00:58.109> you<00:00:58.260> guys<00:00:58.410> get<00:00:58.620> offended<00:00:58.949> this<00:00:59.640> input<00:00:59.879> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
any you guys get offended this input is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.229 
any you guys get offended this input is
on<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> outside<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.199> door<00:01:01.350> but<00:01:02.120> even<00:01:03.120> if

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
on the outside of the door but even if

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.509 
on the outside of the door but even if
it<00:01:03.359> wasn't<00:01:03.660> you'd<00:01:04.170> be<00:01:04.379> leading<00:01:04.619> redstone<00:01:05.220> into

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
it wasn't you'd be leading redstone into

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.609 
it wasn't you'd be leading redstone into
that<00:01:05.640> block<00:01:05.880> anyway<00:01:06.479> yeah<00:01:06.990> so<00:01:07.229> just<00:01:07.380> keep<00:01:07.590> that

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that block anyway yeah so just keep that

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.830 
that block anyway yeah so just keep that
in<00:01:07.890> mind<00:01:08.130> and<00:01:09.500> know<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.830> aren't<00:01:11.070> cheating

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
in mind and know that we aren't cheating

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.010 
in mind and know that we aren't cheating
now<00:01:12.840> if<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> notice<00:01:13.439> here<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.479> top<00:01:15.479> piston<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
now if you notice here the top piston is

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
now if you notice here the top piston is
a<00:01:16.049> bit<00:01:16.409> delayed<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.979> that's<00:01:17.130> because<00:01:17.490> of<00:01:17.610> this

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
a bit delayed and that's because of this

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.820 
a bit delayed and that's because of this
repeater<00:01:18.119> right<00:01:18.360> here<00:01:18.659> if<00:01:19.110> you<00:01:19.259> noticed<00:01:19.619> over

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
repeater right here if you noticed over

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.160 
repeater right here if you noticed over
here<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.820> isn't<00:01:21.090> that<00:01:21.390> problem<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.049> I'll

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
here there isn't that problem and I'll

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.280 
here there isn't that problem and I'll
go<00:01:22.320> over<00:01:22.590> how<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> fix<00:01:23.040> that<00:01:23.250> in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> tutorial

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
go over how to fix that in the tutorial

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
go over how to fix that in the tutorial
now<00:01:25.290> quickly<00:01:25.560> before<00:01:25.979> I<00:01:26.009> start<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.520> tutorial

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
now quickly before I start this tutorial

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.789 
now quickly before I start this tutorial
I<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.150> want<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.540> ask<00:01:27.750> if<00:01:28.049> you<00:01:28.170> guys<00:01:28.380> want<00:01:28.710> a

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
I do want to ask if you guys want a

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.760 
I do want to ask if you guys want a
tutorial<00:01:29.420> for<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.750> door<00:01:30.990> right<00:01:31.259> here<00:01:31.560> the

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
tutorial for this door right here the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.950 
tutorial for this door right here the
mechanics<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.490> completely<00:01:33.420> different<00:01:33.810> and

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
mechanics are completely different and

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.789 
mechanics are completely different and
it's<00:01:34.380> also<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.650> bit<00:01:34.860> faster<00:01:36.200> but<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.380> does<00:01:37.590> use

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
it's also a bit faster but it does use

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.920 
it's also a bit faster but it does use
this<00:01:38.009> sand<00:01:38.369> Tower<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.970> to<00:01:39.150> lead<00:01:39.360> a<00:01:39.570> redstone

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
this sand Tower here to lead a redstone

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.219 
this sand Tower here to lead a redstone
around<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.090> that<00:01:42.090> way<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.329> can't<00:01:42.720> fit<00:01:42.990> it<00:01:43.110> in

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
around and that way you can't fit it in

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.200 
around and that way you can't fit it in
a<00:01:43.350> 4<00:01:43.649> wide<00:01:43.829> wall<00:01:44.130> like<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.880> one<00:01:45.060> we're

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
a 4 wide wall like the one we're

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.359 
a 4 wide wall like the one we're
recording<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.689> tutorial<00:01:45.990> for<00:01:46.380> now<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:47.159> let<00:01:47.310> me

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

our materials and we can go ahead and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
our materials and we can go ahead and
start<00:02:01.890> placing<00:02:02.130> our<00:02:02.310> pistons<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:03.119> here's<00:02:03.450> our

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
start placing our pistons so here's our

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
here on the left and then what we're

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:20.210 
here on the left and then what we're
going<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.959> do<00:02:19.140> is<00:02:19.349> we're<00:02:19.709> gonna<00:02:19.769> start<00:02:19.950> the

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
going to do is we're gonna start the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.530 
going to do is we're gonna start the
wiring<00:02:20.610> for<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.819> bottom<00:02:21.090> we'll<00:02:21.209> worry<00:02:21.420> about

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
wiring for the bottom we'll worry about

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.750 
wiring for the bottom we'll worry about
the<00:02:21.840> outside<00:02:21.989> Pistons<00:02:22.560> later<00:02:22.799> what<00:02:23.670> we're

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the outside Pistons later what we're

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:24.920 
the outside Pistons later what we're
gonna<00:02:23.849> do<00:02:24.030> is<00:02:24.120> we're<00:02:24.239> gonna<00:02:24.299> start<00:02:24.450> off<00:02:24.900> by

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
gonna do is we're gonna start off by

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.190 
gonna do is we're gonna start off by
placing<00:02:25.709> a<00:02:25.829> piston<00:02:26.400> right<00:02:26.610> there<00:02:26.970> this<00:02:27.780> piston

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
placing a piston right there this piston

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.690 
placing a piston right there this piston
is<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.319> monostable<00:02:28.620> piston<00:02:29.189> and<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:29.519> pushing

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
is a monostable piston and it's pushing

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.190 
is a monostable piston and it's pushing
block<00:02:30.030> so<00:02:30.180> we're<00:02:30.299> gonna<00:02:30.390> place<00:02:30.659> a<00:02:30.689> pink<00:02:30.989> block

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
block so we're gonna place a pink block

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.649 
block so we're gonna place a pink block
right<00:02:31.379> there<00:02:31.439> and<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.209> can<00:02:33.359> place<00:02:33.540> our

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:33.659 
right there and then we can place our

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.869 
right there and then we can place our
input<00:02:34.049> this<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.829> our<00:02:34.980> input<00:02:35.310> right<00:02:35.430> here<00:02:35.700> and

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
input this is our input right here and

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.849 
input this is our input right here and
we'll<00:02:36.480> go<00:02:36.629> ahead<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:36.900> place<00:02:37.230> a<00:02:37.260> block<00:02:37.650> to

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.859 
we'll go ahead and place a block to

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:41.000 
we'll go ahead and place a block to
place<00:02:38.069> a<00:02:38.099> button<00:02:38.370> off<00:02:39.349> I'm<00:02:40.349> gonna<00:02:40.560> get<00:02:40.799> started

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
place a button off I'm gonna get started

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.410 
place a button off I'm gonna get started
with<00:02:41.189> the<00:02:41.370> green<00:02:41.579> circuit<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.150> if<00:02:42.299> you

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
with the green circuit and if you

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.030 
with the green circuit and if you
remember<00:02:42.659> that's<00:02:42.930> the<00:02:43.200> closing<00:02:43.620> and<00:02:43.739> first

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
remember that's the closing and first

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.789 
remember that's the closing and first
block<00:02:44.280> retraction<00:02:44.849> so<00:02:45.599> we're<00:02:46.379> gonna<00:02:46.530> take<00:02:46.739> a

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:46.799 
block retraction so we're gonna take a

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:48.619 
block retraction so we're gonna take a
signal<00:02:47.099> from<00:02:47.340> this<00:02:47.489> piston<00:02:47.849> monostable<00:02:48.269> here

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
signal from this piston monostable here

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:52.759 
signal from this piston monostable here
into<00:02:49.139> a<00:02:49.170> repeater<00:02:49.650> on<00:02:49.739> one<00:02:50.750> into<00:02:51.750> a<00:02:51.780> block<00:02:52.139> with

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
into a repeater on one into a block with

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.420 
into a repeater on one into a block with
a<00:02:52.799> redstone<00:02:53.129> on<00:02:53.400> top<00:02:53.629> and<00:02:54.629> then<00:02:55.349> a<00:02:55.739> block<00:02:56.190> right

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
a redstone on top and then a block right

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.849 
a redstone on top and then a block right
there<00:02:56.489> to<00:02:56.849> power<00:02:57.000> that<00:02:57.209> toppest<00:02:57.629> and<00:02:57.859> this

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:58.859 
there to power that toppest and this

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.740 
there to power that toppest and this
redstone<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.730> also<00:02:59.970> going<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.150> be<00:03:00.209> powering<00:03:00.569> a

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
redstone is also going to be powering a

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.199 
redstone is also going to be powering a
piston<00:03:01.200> right<00:03:01.379> here<00:03:01.739> and<00:03:01.920> we're<00:03:02.849> gonna<00:03:02.939> give

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
piston right here and we're gonna give

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:06.800 
piston right here and we're gonna give
it<00:03:03.299> a<00:03:03.359> block<00:03:04.400> don't<00:03:05.400> place<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.700> here<00:03:06.239> but<00:03:06.599> leave

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
it a block don't place it here but leave

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.740 
it a block don't place it here but leave
a<00:03:06.840> block<00:03:07.260> of<00:03:07.470> air<00:03:07.819> like<00:03:08.819> that<00:03:09.030> so<00:03:09.239> this<00:03:09.389> piston

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
a block of air like that so this piston

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.410 
a block of air like that so this piston
will<00:03:09.780> be<00:03:10.019> pulling<00:03:10.409> it<00:03:10.530> back<00:03:11.299> we're<00:03:12.299> gonna

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
will be pulling it back we're gonna

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
will be pulling it back we're gonna
place<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.689> block<00:03:12.989> underneath<00:03:13.439> this<00:03:13.829> piston

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
place a block underneath this piston

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.330 
place a block underneath this piston
here<00:03:14.519> and<00:03:14.750> put<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.780> torch<00:03:16.079> on<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.319> then<00:03:17.220> we're

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
here and put a torch on it then we're

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.430 
here and put a torch on it then we're
gonna<00:03:17.430> place<00:03:17.669> two<00:03:18.030> blocks<00:03:18.329> here<00:03:18.480> with

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
gonna place two blocks here with

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.470 
gonna place two blocks here with
redstone<00:03:19.919> on<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.069> top<00:03:20.310> lead<00:03:20.910> this<00:03:21.090> redstone

torch on top of that and then finally
here<00:03:29.819> let's<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.150> get<00:03:30.659> rid<00:03:30.720> of<00:03:30.840> that<00:03:30.959> we're

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
here let's just get rid of that we're

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.649 
here let's just get rid of that we're
gonna<00:03:31.859> place<00:03:32.099> a<00:03:32.129> torch<00:03:32.519> right<00:03:32.760> there<00:03:33.000> we'll

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:33.659 
gonna place a torch right there we'll

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:35.270 
gonna place a torch right there we'll
fix<00:03:33.870> that<00:03:33.989> up<00:03:34.109> later<00:03:34.409> you're<00:03:34.949> gonna<00:03:35.069> leave

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
fix that up later you're gonna leave

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.539 
fix that up later you're gonna leave
this<00:03:35.430> redstone<00:03:35.909> here<00:03:35.940> into<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:37.340> repeater<00:03:38.340> right

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:38.549 
this redstone here into a repeater right

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:40.610 
this redstone here into a repeater right
there<00:03:38.760> and<00:03:38.940> then<00:03:39.209> into<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.510> block<00:03:39.810> and<00:03:40.019> that

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
there and then into a block and that

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.189 
there and then into a block and that
should<00:03:40.799> be<00:03:40.919> our<00:03:40.949> entire<00:03:41.489> first<00:03:41.819> block

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:42.199 
should be our entire first block

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:45.500 
should be our entire first block
retraction<00:03:43.199> as<00:03:43.349> well<00:03:43.620> as<00:03:43.739> our<00:03:43.859> closing<00:03:44.510> let's

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
retraction as well as our closing let's

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.080 
retraction as well as our closing let's
just<00:03:45.720> go<00:03:45.840> ahead<00:03:45.959> and<00:03:46.260> fix<00:03:46.739> this<00:03:47.010> and<00:03:47.400> we<00:03:47.459> can

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
just go ahead and fix this and we can

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.490 
just go ahead and fix this and we can
try<00:03:48.419> and<00:03:48.599> run<00:03:48.810> it<00:03:48.979> there<00:03:49.979> it<00:03:50.129> is<00:03:50.250> closed<00:03:50.669> and

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
try and run it there it is closed and

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.899 
try and run it there it is closed and
there<00:03:52.500> it<00:03:52.620> is<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.919> first<00:03:53.040> block<00:03:53.340> retracted

00:03:53.899 --> 00:03:53.909 
there it is the first block retracted

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:55.849 
there it is the first block retracted
now<00:03:54.569> we<00:03:54.629> can<00:03:54.900> go<00:03:55.049> ahead<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.290> get<00:03:55.470> started<00:03:55.769> on

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:55.859 
now we can go ahead and get started on

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.149 
now we can go ahead and get started on
the<00:03:55.979> orange<00:03:56.430> double<00:03:56.970> extender<00:03:57.919> alright<00:03:58.919> so<00:03:59.069> we

here and then from this hopper we're

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:41.170 
here and then from this hopper we're
gonna<00:04:39.560> lead<00:04:39.800> a<00:04:39.830> comparator<00:04:40.580> and<00:04:40.699> that's<00:04:41.000> gonna

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
gonna lead a comparator and that's gonna

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.719 
gonna lead a comparator and that's gonna
power<00:04:41.449> the<00:04:41.600> bottom<00:04:41.900> piston<00:04:42.580> finally<00:04:43.580> what

00:04:43.719 --> 00:04:43.729 
power the bottom piston finally what

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:44.830 
power the bottom piston finally what
we're<00:04:43.820> gonna<00:04:43.940> do<00:04:44.150> is<00:04:44.270> we're<00:04:44.360> gonna<00:04:44.449> lead<00:04:44.690> this

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
we're gonna do is we're gonna lead this

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:47.020 
we're gonna do is we're gonna lead this
redstone<00:04:45.199> going<00:04:45.650> down<00:04:45.949> into<00:04:46.280> redstone<00:04:46.850> right

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
redstone going down into redstone right

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.540 
redstone going down into redstone right
there<00:04:47.240> into<00:04:48.110> two<00:04:48.320> repeaters<00:04:48.770> going<00:04:49.250> into<00:04:49.430> that

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:49.550 
there into two repeaters going into that

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:52.180 
there into two repeaters going into that
green<00:04:49.759> book<00:04:49.970> block<00:04:50.240> one<00:04:51.199> on<00:04:51.289> four<00:04:51.650> one<00:04:52.039> on

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
green book block one on four one on

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:54.310 
green book block one on four one on
three<00:04:52.460> that<00:04:53.449> should<00:04:53.660> be<00:04:53.750> it<00:04:53.870> for<00:04:53.900> the<00:04:54.139> bottom

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
three that should be it for the bottom

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.950 
three that should be it for the bottom
circuit<00:04:54.830> let's<00:04:55.009> just<00:04:55.220> go<00:04:55.340> ahead<00:04:55.460> and<00:04:55.750> test<00:04:56.750> it

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
circuit let's just go ahead and test it

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.060 
circuit let's just go ahead and test it
out<00:04:57.820> so<00:04:58.820> we<00:04:58.940> hit<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.090> button<00:04:59.830> there<00:05:00.830> it<00:05:00.979> is

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
out so we hit the button there it is

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.020 
out so we hit the button there it is
closed<00:05:01.870> and<00:05:02.870> there<00:05:03.800> it<00:05:03.889> is<00:05:03.979> retracted<00:05:04.580> now<00:05:04.970> we

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
closed and there it is retracted now we

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.370 
closed and there it is retracted now we
can<00:05:05.210> go<00:05:05.330> ahead<00:05:05.419> and<00:05:05.539> get<00:05:05.690> started<00:05:05.960> on<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.229> blue

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
can go ahead and get started on the blue

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:08.640 
can go ahead and get started on the blue
circuit<00:05:06.800> and<00:05:06.979> lead<00:05:07.250> all<00:05:07.430> the<00:05:07.580> Redstone<00:05:07.789> around

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
circuit and lead all the Redstone around

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:11.110 
circuit and lead all the Redstone around
all<00:05:09.650> right<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.039> we<00:05:10.160> got<00:05:10.340> our<00:05:10.370> sticky<00:05:10.789> pistons

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
all right so we got our sticky pistons

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.249 
all right so we got our sticky pistons
what<00:05:11.240> we're<00:05:11.330> gonna<00:05:11.419> do<00:05:11.630> is<00:05:11.750> we're<00:05:11.840> gonna<00:05:11.900> come

00:05:12.249 --> 00:05:12.259 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna come

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:14.980 
what we're gonna do is we're gonna come
and<00:05:12.500> start<00:05:12.889> on<00:05:13.039> the<00:05:13.160> left<00:05:13.430> here<00:05:13.940> place<00:05:14.780> a

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.939 
thing on the other side we're gonna
place<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.449> piston<00:05:26.870> on<00:05:27.080> top<00:05:27.169> of<00:05:27.410> that<00:05:27.500> redstone

00:05:27.939 --> 00:05:27.949 
place a piston on top of that redstone

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.339 
place a piston on top of that redstone
there<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:29.060> two<00:05:29.330> more<00:05:29.539> above<00:05:29.840> it<00:05:29.990> like<00:05:30.110> that

00:05:30.339 --> 00:05:30.349 
there and two more above it like that

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:32.860 
there and two more above it like that
and<00:05:30.699> then<00:05:31.699> finally<00:05:32.150> what<00:05:32.300> we're<00:05:32.389> gonna<00:05:32.510> do<00:05:32.690> is

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
and then finally what we're gonna do is

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.460 
and then finally what we're gonna do is
we're<00:05:32.990> gonna<00:05:33.130> take<00:05:34.130> a<00:05:34.190> piston<00:05:34.580> and<00:05:35.320> place<00:05:36.320> it

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
we're gonna take a piston and place it

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:38.350 
we're gonna take a piston and place it
upside<00:05:36.680> down<00:05:37.039> to<00:05:37.490> push<00:05:37.639> that<00:05:37.789> middle<00:05:38.030> piston

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
upside down to push that middle piston

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.120 
upside down to push that middle piston
this<00:05:38.960> is<00:05:39.020> gonna<00:05:39.110> be<00:05:39.289> our<00:05:39.320> blue<00:05:39.560> circuit<00:05:39.979> so

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
this is gonna be our blue circuit so

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.189 
this is gonna be our blue circuit so
we're<00:05:40.250> gonna<00:05:40.370> take<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.610> blue<00:05:40.909> wall<00:05:41.120> and<00:05:41.449> we're

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:42.199 
we're gonna take a blue wall and we're

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:43.659 
we're gonna take a blue wall and we're
gonna<00:05:42.320> place<00:05:42.590> a<00:05:42.620> block<00:05:42.979> above<00:05:43.250> that<00:05:43.430> torch

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 
gonna place a block above that torch

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:45.879 
gonna place a block above that torch
with<00:05:43.849> a<00:05:43.909> redstone<00:05:44.090> on<00:05:44.449> top<00:05:44.690> this<00:05:45.409> is<00:05:45.470> actually

00:05:45.879 --> 00:05:45.889 
with a redstone on top this is actually

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:47.379 
with a redstone on top this is actually
gonna<00:05:46.010> be<00:05:46.099> your<00:05:46.340> wall<00:05:46.550> so<00:05:46.820> let<00:05:46.970> me<00:05:47.030> just<00:05:47.240> get

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
gonna be your wall so let me just get

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.339 
gonna be your wall so let me just get
the<00:05:47.570> wall<00:05:47.810> material<00:05:48.349> real<00:05:48.530> fast<00:05:50.349> lead

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:51.349 
the wall material real fast lead

00:05:51.349 --> 00:05:53.320 
the wall material real fast lead
redstone<00:05:51.800> up<00:05:52.039> there<00:05:52.340> on<00:05:52.520> top<00:05:52.789> of<00:05:52.940> your<00:05:53.150> wall

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
redstone up there on top of your wall

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.450 
redstone up there on top of your wall
lead<00:05:53.870> it<00:05:54.050> back<00:05:54.289> you<00:05:54.650> don't<00:05:54.680> have<00:05:55.070> to<00:05:55.190> lead<00:05:55.340> it

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
lead it back you don't have to lead it

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:58.839 
lead it back you don't have to lead it
over<00:05:55.789> this<00:05:55.909> piston<00:05:56.949> then<00:05:57.949> lead<00:05:58.370> redstone

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
over this piston then lead redstone

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:01.570 
over this piston then lead redstone
going<00:05:59.180> across<00:05:59.740> onto<00:06:00.740> your<00:06:00.889> ceiling<00:06:01.340> there

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:01.580 
going across onto your ceiling there

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.930 
going across onto your ceiling there
lead<00:06:02.389> it<00:06:02.539> down<00:06:02.840> here<00:06:03.770> again<00:06:04.190> this<00:06:04.520> is<00:06:04.580> gonna<00:06:04.759> be

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
lead it down here again this is gonna be

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.999 
lead it down here again this is gonna be
your<00:06:05.090> wall<00:06:05.330> and<00:06:05.599> then<00:06:06.169> lead<00:06:06.380> it<00:06:06.500> down<00:06:06.710> once

00:06:06.999 --> 00:06:07.009 
your wall and then lead it down once

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.159 
your wall and then lead it down once
again<00:06:07.159> to<00:06:07.729> power<00:06:08.300> that<00:06:08.479> middle<00:06:08.690> piston<00:06:08.990> and

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:09.169 
again to power that middle piston and

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:10.719 
again to power that middle piston and
that<00:06:09.320> will<00:06:09.440> also<00:06:09.590> power<00:06:09.889> the<00:06:10.009> bottom<00:06:10.370> piston

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:10.729 
that will also power the bottom piston

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.360 
that will also power the bottom piston
and<00:06:11.389> then<00:06:11.720> finally<00:06:12.169> we're<00:06:12.289> gonna<00:06:12.349> lead<00:06:12.650> up<00:06:12.919> to

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:13.370 
and then finally we're gonna lead up to

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:15.159 
and then finally we're gonna lead up to
power<00:06:13.610> that<00:06:13.759> toppest<00:06:14.210> and<00:06:14.389> we<00:06:14.690> need<00:06:14.840> to<00:06:14.960> take<00:06:15.139> a

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:15.169 
power that toppest and we need to take a

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:17.620 
power that toppest and we need to take a
repeater<00:06:15.560> and<00:06:15.759> just<00:06:16.759> lead<00:06:16.970> it<00:06:17.090> going<00:06:17.389> into

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:17.630 
repeater and just lead it going into

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.060 
repeater and just lead it going into
that<00:06:17.810> piston<00:06:18.680> right<00:06:18.830> there<00:06:19.120> try<00:06:20.120> it<00:06:20.180> out<00:06:21.070> there

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:22.070 
that piston right there try it out there

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.879 
that piston right there try it out there
it<00:06:22.250> is<00:06:22.310> closed

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:23.889 
it is closed

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.170 
it is closed
and<00:06:24.419> there<00:06:25.419> it<00:06:25.539> is<00:06:25.629> open<00:06:26.039> now<00:06:27.039> again<00:06:27.520> as<00:06:27.759> I<00:06:28.120> said

00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:28.180 
and there it is open now again as I said

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.779 
and there it is open now again as I said
that<00:06:28.780> top<00:06:29.050> is<00:06:29.229> turn<00:06:29.409> is<00:06:29.530> a<00:06:29.560> bit<00:06:29.770> delayed<00:06:30.129> if

00:06:30.779 --> 00:06:30.789 
that top is turn is a bit delayed if

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:33.689 
that top is turn is a bit delayed if
that<00:06:31.539> does<00:06:31.810> bother<00:06:32.110> you<00:06:32.379> then<00:06:33.340> what<00:06:33.520> you<00:06:33.610> can

00:06:33.689 --> 00:06:33.699 
that does bother you then what you can

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.909 
that does bother you then what you can
do<00:06:33.879> is<00:06:34.090> can<00:06:34.270> go<00:06:34.479> up<00:06:34.659> here<00:06:34.689> get<00:06:35.560> rid<00:06:35.710> of<00:06:35.770> that

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:35.919 
do is can go up here get rid of that

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:38.490 
do is can go up here get rid of that
repeater<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:36.580> then<00:06:37.300> what<00:06:37.509> I<00:06:37.539> would<00:06:37.810> do<00:06:37.990> is

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:38.500 
repeater and then what I would do is

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.649 
repeater and then what I would do is
I'll<00:06:38.800> just<00:06:39.009> take<00:06:39.189> that<00:06:39.370> redstone<00:06:39.610> leave<00:06:40.300> it<00:06:40.389> up

00:06:40.649 --> 00:06:40.659 
I'll just take that redstone leave it up

00:06:40.659 --> 00:06:43.140 
I'll just take that redstone leave it up
and<00:06:41.020> then<00:06:41.500> back<00:06:41.740> down<00:06:41.770> and<00:06:42.340> then<00:06:42.849> that<00:06:43.030> will

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
and then back down and then that will

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.670 
and then back down and then that will
power<00:06:43.300> that<00:06:43.569> top<00:06:43.810> piston<00:06:44.139> without<00:06:44.439> that

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
power that top piston without that

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:48.089 
power that top piston without that
repeater<00:06:45.039> causing<00:06:45.610> the<00:06:45.729> delay<00:06:46.800> there<00:06:47.800> you<00:06:47.949> go

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:48.099 
repeater causing the delay there you go

00:06:48.099 --> 00:06:50.790 
repeater causing the delay there you go
that's<00:06:48.400> your<00:06:48.729> entire<00:06:49.120> 3x3<00:06:49.840> door<00:06:50.020> done<00:06:50.379> let's

00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:50.800 
that's your entire 3x3 door done let's

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.600 
that's your entire 3x3 door done let's
just<00:06:51.189> go<00:06:51.340> ahead<00:06:51.460> and<00:06:51.669> fill<00:06:51.819> this<00:06:51.939> thing<00:06:52.180> in

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:53.610 
just go ahead and fill this thing in

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:55.800 
just go ahead and fill this thing in
what<00:06:54.610> I<00:06:54.639> like<00:06:54.729> about<00:06:55.030> this<00:06:55.270> is<00:06:55.449> that<00:06:55.479> you<00:06:55.689> can

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:55.810 
what I like about this is that you can

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:57.420 
what I like about this is that you can
fill<00:06:56.020> in<00:06:56.139> all<00:06:56.289> the<00:06:56.469> corner<00:06:56.800> blocks<00:06:57.039> around<00:06:57.219> the

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:57.430 
fill in all the corner blocks around the

00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:59.390 
fill in all the corner blocks around the
edge<00:06:57.610> so<00:06:57.639> let's<00:06:58.120> just<00:06:58.330> go<00:06:58.449> ahead<00:06:58.479> and<00:06:58.629> do<00:06:58.779> this
