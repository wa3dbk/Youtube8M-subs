00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.370
 all right 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.540
 do not 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.429
 we are with the ghost's son in the 

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.039
 royal albert hall that such a son of 

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:18.020
 ghost that they give me so much 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.840
 nice to meet you here in my dressing room 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.640
 staff preparing me for the event 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.009
 that we will have next July 11 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.290
 precisely here in the royal albert 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.599
 hall to which of your opponents you want to see 

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.669
 Note that it completely knocked out 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.520
 it seems to me that that day comes here 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.110
 son of the legend blue demon junior and 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.260
 I am also the son of a legend 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.640
 the son of the blue demon ghost says that 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.010
 if that day is showing up here in the 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.780
 royal albert you will see what leather 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.670
 more straps come out 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.149
 do you have any lesson how many do you have 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.440
 you are all there in the world but 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.239
 at this moment I feel very strong 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.839
 after having had injuries in 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 cervical lower back waist knees 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:04.259
 ankles , broken fingers broken nose heels 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.850
 three times but that day I was almost 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.860
 detached from the retina but you do not 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.860
 worry blue demon junior because the 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.899
 day 11 we have here at the royal albert 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.369
 you are going to find the ghost's son more 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:17.009
 strong than ever and you will run into 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.840
 It seems that you can eat like 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.970
 preparation for this fight so let me 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.880
 tell you that the diet of a fighter 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.890
 professional is very complicated because 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.649
 we have to have a high diet in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:32.759
 proteins and many times you crave the 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:34.830
 little cake the little cake the soda the sugar 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.119
 but you can not do it you always have 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.030
 that be very well prepared 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:43.500
 dietically speaking and well in my 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:46.020
 case my diet is based a lot on chicken 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.960
 as much fish support within the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.080
 fish like salmon tuna white fish 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.479
 always to maintain a good body 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.010
 so that people appreciate it and be 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.840
 happy with the image of the son of 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:59.340
 ghost and few carbohydrates and what is 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.600
 your favorite zero carbohydrate 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.150
 carbohydrates in a carbohydrate 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.090
 favorite is chocolate but for 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.560
 of course I have to keep it in the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:10.280
 the name nothing else I am the champion of 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.830
 chocolate but until then I think that 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.840
 the public deserves a respect and they 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:16.790
 He deserves admiration and even though 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.980
 I am a tough fighter who does not respect 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.600
 the rules nor respect my opponents the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.300
 public if you have to respect it and 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.920
 always offer you a 100% image is 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.020
 that's why I'm the world champion 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.330
 cruise the world number 1 in a 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.910
 division they all want that championship and 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.800
 that's why I have this body and you have some 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:36.530
 ritual before going out to fight for 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.600
 course always the preparation to carry 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.760
 always appropriate clothing if it is a 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.440
 high profile event as it will be 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.750
 that we will have next July 11 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.360
 so I'm going to be a special team to 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.120
 that presentation I like to dress well 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.120
 be presentable to the public and 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.580
 before climbing although they do not believe me 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.380
 he spent praying praying praying the 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.530
 talent and preparation I already have 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.660
 because I have 15 years as a professional and 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.400
 26 years in this in this sport 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.380
 training what is learning what 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.120
 preparation and I bring it but always 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.540
 you have to entrust yourself to something in my case 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.299
 that prayer I pray prayer to leave 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:16.250
 avante many times we go up to fight 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.990
 but we do not know if we are going to return 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:19.790
 the wrestling will be all that you 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:21.200
 want and send but it's a sport of 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.870
 high risk is a sport in which 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.090
 you risk life every presentation and it's 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.880
 why I entrust myself to God and I 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.470
 I ask to get ahead with this fight you are 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.959
 the son of a legend the son of 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.750
 Ghost ghost inherited as 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:39.020
 Note that nothing is given the 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:40.790
 name and design a lot of people tell me 

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.640
 that I inherited his genetics that I have very 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.160
 good very good presence above the 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.830
 quadrilateral and that I know what he called it 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:51.590
 he does not think it's something that assaults him 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:55.160
 to him this people like me very much 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:57.350
 presentations always in the old style 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.940
 school with a good coat a good 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.800
 jacket always a presentation 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.420
 impeccable and that is also given to me 

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.940
 father is one of the teachings that 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:07.400
 has always given me to always keep a 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:09.110
 presentation to 100% for the public the 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.790
 son of the ghost in the royal albert 

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:12.350
 hall as you see it would be that very well you 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:13.310
 you knew to beat that guy who is 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:15.800
 behind the camera 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.049
 it is very easy a kick in the bowels 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:19.880
 and obviously a breaker followed by 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.100
 a hurracarrana I assure you that I do not know 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.639
 raise the son of the ghost in the royal 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.569
 albert hall 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:25.569
 you can not miss it 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.880
 plus
