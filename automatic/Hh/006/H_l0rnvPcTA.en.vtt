a biology students we're going to take a
couple<00:00:05.250> minutes<00:00:05.370> here<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.879> go<00:00:06.480> through<00:00:06.509> a<00:00:06.839> a

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.210 
couple minutes here and go through a a

the time we get to spend covering it in
class<00:00:15.540> I<00:00:15.870> need<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.440> start<00:00:16.650> off<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:16.800> saying<00:00:16.980> that

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
class I need to start off by saying that

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.189 
class I need to start off by saying that
this<00:00:17.400> image<00:00:17.670> is<00:00:17.910> not<00:00:18.029> mine<00:00:18.330> I<00:00:18.539> did<00:00:18.779> not<00:00:18.930> create

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
this image is not mine I did not create

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.439 
this image is not mine I did not create
it<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:19.529> as<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.710> made<00:00:20.070> this<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:20.880> PowerPoint

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
it but as I made this the PowerPoint

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.080 
it but as I made this the PowerPoint
that<00:00:22.140> is<00:00:22.740> on<00:00:22.890> two<00:00:23.160> years<00:00:23.400> ago<00:00:23.609> I<00:00:23.640> don't

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
that is on two years ago I don't

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:25.250 
that is on two years ago I don't
remember<00:00:24.420> where<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.930> from<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> I

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
remember where I got it from and I

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.870 
remember where I got it from and I
couldn't<00:00:25.560> find<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.099> hopefully<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:26.849> not

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
couldn't find it so hopefully I'm not

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.120 
couldn't find it so hopefully I'm not
violating<00:00:27.810> any<00:00:28.050> copyright<00:00:28.230> laws<00:00:28.680> but<00:00:28.859> this<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
violating any copyright laws but this is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.410 
violating any copyright laws but this is
not<00:00:29.310> my<00:00:29.519> work<00:00:29.789> in<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.090> image

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
not my work in this image

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.959 
not my work in this image
however<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:31.289> explanation<00:00:31.830> that<00:00:31.859> follows<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
however the explanation that follows is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.229 
however the explanation that follows is
is<00:00:33.390> original<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.050> it<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.170> mine<00:00:34.460> so<00:00:35.460> here<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
is original and it is mine so here you

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
is original and it is mine so here you
can<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:37.380> for<00:00:37.980> those<00:00:38.070> of<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.309> they're<00:00:38.430> not

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
can see and for those of you they're not

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:39.860 
can see and for those of you they're not
in<00:00:38.700> my<00:00:38.790> class<00:00:39.059> I'm<00:00:39.300> assuming<00:00:39.690> that<00:00:39.809> you

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
in my class I'm assuming that you

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.270 
in my class I'm assuming that you
already<00:00:39.899> know<00:00:40.260> a<00:00:40.290> little<00:00:40.500> bit<00:00:40.680> about<00:00:40.739> DNA

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
already know a little bit about DNA

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.069 
already know a little bit about DNA
replication<00:00:41.730> so<00:00:42.420> we're<00:00:42.629> going<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:42.930> walk

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
replication so we're going to go walk

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.750 
replication so we're going to go walk
through<00:00:43.290> this<00:00:43.379> first<00:00:43.649> by<00:00:44.160> following<00:00:44.579> what

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
through this first by following what

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.430 
through this first by following what
happens<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.270> leading<00:00:45.600> strand<00:00:45.899> shown<00:00:46.230> here

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
happens in the leading strand shown here

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.290 
happens in the leading strand shown here
on<00:00:46.530> top<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.010> then<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.550> lagging<00:00:47.879> strand<00:00:48.149> on

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
on top and then the lagging strand on

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.299 
on top and then the lagging strand on
bottom<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.320> let's<00:00:49.469> start<00:00:49.649> off<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.920> noting

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
bottom so let's start off with noting

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.970 
bottom so let's start off with noting
the<00:00:50.579> template<00:00:51.170> orientation<00:00:52.170> template<00:00:52.620> strand

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
the template orientation template strand

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.770 
orientation in the leading strand notice
the<00:00:55.289> template<00:00:55.770> strand<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.570> traveling<00:00:57.570> in<00:00:57.629> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the template strand is traveling in the

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.990 
the template strand is traveling in the
three<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.320> five<00:00:58.620> direction<00:00:59.219> as<00:00:59.340> we<00:00:59.489> move<00:00:59.699> right

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
three to five direction as we move right

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.330 
three to five direction as we move right
to<00:01:00.210> left<00:01:00.449> on<00:01:00.600> your<00:01:00.719> screen<00:01:01.079> in<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:01.800> image<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
to left on your screen in this image the

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.160 
to left on your screen in this image the
overall<00:01:02.820> direction<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.420> replication<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
overall direction of replication is

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
overall direction of replication is
indicated<00:01:04.710> down<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.070> on<00:01:05.159> the<00:01:05.250> bottom<00:01:05.430> is

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
indicated down here on the bottom is

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.969 
indicated down here on the bottom is
actually<00:01:05.909> going<00:01:06.390> right<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.780> left<00:01:06.920> okay<00:01:07.920> so

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
actually going right to left okay so

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.370 
actually going right to left okay so
when<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:08.909> say<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> template<00:01:09.600> strand<00:01:09.750> has<00:01:10.049> three

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
when I say the template strand has three

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.800 
when I say the template strand has three
to<00:01:10.500> five<00:01:10.770> orientation<00:01:11.670> that<00:01:11.970> is<00:01:12.240> this<00:01:12.450> dark

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
to five orientation that is this dark

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.649 
to five orientation that is this dark
blue<00:01:13.200> strand<00:01:13.590> on<00:01:13.740> top<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:14.880> this<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> this<00:01:15.479> is

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
blue strand on top so this is this is

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
blue strand on top so this is this is
the<00:01:15.810> leading<00:01:16.229> strand<00:01:16.560> now<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.250> as<00:01:17.400> we

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
the leading strand now because as we

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
the leading strand now because as we
know<00:01:17.640> from<00:01:17.759> class<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.720> enzyme<00:01:19.140> DNA

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
know from class the enzyme DNA

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.770 
know from class the enzyme DNA
polymerase<00:01:20.070> can<00:01:20.189> only<00:01:20.759> add<00:01:21.060> sequential

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
polymerase can only add sequential

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.020 
polymerase can only add sequential
nucleotides<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:23.189> five<00:01:23.430> prime<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> three

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
nucleotides in the five prime to three

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.420 
nucleotides in the five prime to three
prime<00:01:24.330> direction<00:01:24.680> so<00:01:25.680> since<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.009> template

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
prime direction so since the template

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.520 
prime direction so since the template
strand<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.299> three<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.659> five<00:01:27.900> that

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
strand is going to three to five that

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.880 
strand is going to three to five that
allows<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.329> synthesized<00:01:30.329> strand<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:31.290> go<00:01:31.409> 5<00:01:31.680> to

3 in other words the DNA polymerase can

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.740 
3 in other words the DNA polymerase can
just<00:01:34.650> cruise<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.040> along<00:01:35.970> this<00:01:36.299> template

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
just cruise right along this template

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.200 
just cruise right along this template
strand<00:01:37.140> adding<00:01:37.860> individual<00:01:38.400> nucleotides<00:01:38.790> as

strand adding individual nucleotides as
it<00:01:39.329> goes<00:01:39.979> so<00:01:40.979> here<00:01:41.159> these<00:01:41.310> purple<00:01:41.820> ovals<00:01:42.180> our

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
it goes so here these purple ovals our

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.440 
it goes so here these purple ovals our

in the RNA primer and that pretty much

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.710 
in the RNA primer and that pretty much
covers<00:03:01.890> the<00:03:02.160> leading<00:03:02.430> strand<00:03:02.700> once<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.569> RNA

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
covers the leading strand once the RNA

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.900 
covers the leading strand once the RNA

add an RNA primer and then DNA

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.509 
add an RNA primer and then DNA

until it bumps into another one of these

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.090 
until it bumps into another one of these
fragments<00:04:12.180> ok<00:04:13.170> and<00:04:13.350> so<00:04:13.440> people<00:04:13.590> always<00:04:13.829> ask

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
fragments ok and so people always ask

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.410 
fragments ok and so people always ask
well<00:04:14.250> why<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.459> it<00:04:14.670> in<00:04:14.790> these<00:04:14.850> fragments<00:04:15.329> why

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:15.420 
well why is it in these fragments why

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.599 
well why is it in these fragments why
can't<00:04:15.720> it<00:04:15.780> go<00:04:15.900> in<00:04:16.049> one<00:04:16.079> piece<00:04:16.500> and<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.340> reason

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
can't it go in one piece and the reason

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.610 
can't it go in one piece and the reason
why<00:04:17.729> DNA<00:04:18.150> polymerase<00:04:18.750> that<00:04:18.810> is<00:04:19.109> not<00:04:19.380> going<00:04:19.530> to

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
why DNA polymerase that is not going to

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.409 
why DNA polymerase that is not going to
synthesize<00:04:20.070> this<00:04:20.310> lagging<00:04:20.850> strand<00:04:21.090> in<00:04:21.239> one

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
synthesize this lagging strand in one

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.690 
synthesize this lagging strand in one
piece<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:21.930> because<00:04:22.710> if<00:04:22.860> we<00:04:23.010> waited<00:04:23.370> for<00:04:23.400> the

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
piece is because if we waited for the

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.490 
piece is because if we waited for the
helicase<00:04:24.390> to<00:04:24.599> unzip<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.140> entire<00:04:25.590> DNA

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
helicase to unzip the entire DNA

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.680 
helicase to unzip the entire DNA
and<00:04:26.680> then<00:04:27.580> there'd<00:04:27.760> be<00:04:27.880> a<00:04:27.910> possibility<00:04:28.480> for

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:28.690 
and then there'd be a possibility for

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.510 
and then there'd be a possibility for
the<00:04:28.930> DNA<00:04:29.290> strand<00:04:29.590> to<00:04:29.680> fold<00:04:29.980> back<00:04:30.250> on<00:04:30.280> itself

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
the DNA strand to fold back on itself

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:33.900 
the DNA strand to fold back on itself
get<00:04:31.150> twisted<00:04:31.420> up<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:32.590> bunch<00:04:33.460> of<00:04:33.550> things<00:04:33.790> that

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
get twisted up a bunch of things that

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.820 
get twisted up a bunch of things that
could<00:04:34.570> be<00:04:34.600> very<00:04:34.780> complicated<00:04:34.990> can<00:04:35.500> happen

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
could be very complicated can happen

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.830 
could be very complicated can happen
that<00:04:36.250> prevent<00:04:36.670> us<00:04:36.790> from<00:04:36.850> synthesizing<00:04:37.720> a<00:04:37.810> new

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
that prevent us from synthesizing a new

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.860 
that prevent us from synthesizing a new
strand<00:04:38.410> of<00:04:38.530> DNA<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:39.070> so<00:04:39.700> DNA<00:04:40.300> instead<00:04:40.720> on<00:04:40.840> the

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
strand of DNA and so DNA instead on the

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.120 
strand of DNA and so DNA instead on the
lagging<00:04:41.080> strand<00:04:41.290> gets<00:04:41.650> added<00:04:41.860> in<00:04:42.040> these

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
lagging strand gets added in these

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.220 
lagging strand gets added in these
fragments<00:04:42.700> called<00:04:42.880> Okazaki<00:04:43.270> fragments<00:04:44.080> and

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:44.230 
fragments called Okazaki fragments and

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:46.830 
fragments called Okazaki fragments and
so<00:04:44.830> DNA<00:04:45.160> polymerase<00:04:45.610> will<00:04:45.880> add<00:04:46.000> new<00:04:46.300> bases<00:04:46.720> in

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
so DNA polymerase will add new bases in

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.870 
so DNA polymerase will add new bases in
the<00:04:46.930> 5<00:04:47.140> prime<00:04:47.350> to<00:04:47.380> 3<00:04:47.530> prime<00:04:47.860> direction<00:04:47.890> until

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
the 5 prime to 3 prime direction until

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.150 
the 5 prime to 3 prime direction until
it<00:04:48.940> bumps<00:04:49.330> into<00:04:49.450> an<00:04:49.780> RNA<00:04:50.140> primer<00:04:50.320> in<00:04:51.040> which

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
it bumps into an RNA primer in which

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.190 
it bumps into an RNA primer in which
case<00:04:51.400> it<00:04:51.550> will<00:04:51.640> detach<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.150> stop<00:04:52.390> and<00:04:52.840> then

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
case it will detach and stop and then

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.630 
case it will detach and stop and then
later<00:04:53.410> processes<00:04:54.010> will<00:04:54.190> connect<00:04:54.490> those

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
later processes will connect those

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.600 
later processes will connect those
pieces<00:04:54.940> so<00:04:55.570> hope<00:04:56.140> with<00:04:56.320> shuffle<00:04:56.830> and<00:04:56.980> good

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
pieces so hope with shuffle and good

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.120 
pieces so hope with shuffle and good
