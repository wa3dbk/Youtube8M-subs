this<00:00:00.329> is<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> short<00:00:00.930> video<00:00:01.230> just<00:00:01.860> showing<00:00:02.490> you

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:02.700 
this is a short video just showing you

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.789 
this is a short video just showing you
briefly<00:00:03.210> how<00:00:03.659> to<00:00:03.980> program<00:00:04.980> the<00:00:05.190> WG<00:00:06.080> gsm<00:00:07.080> alarm

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
briefly how to program the WG gsm alarm

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.759 
briefly how to program the WG gsm alarm
system<00:00:08.460> the<00:00:09.360> important<00:00:09.990> thing<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> remember

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
system the important thing to remember

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.419 
system the important thing to remember
is<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.509> make<00:00:12.509> sure<00:00:12.540> the<00:00:13.019> alarm<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.590> disarmed

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
is to make sure the alarm is disarmed

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.090 
is to make sure the alarm is disarmed
before<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:15.030> try<00:00:15.299> to<00:00:15.330> do<00:00:15.719> it<00:00:15.900> if<00:00:16.379> it's<00:00:16.650> armed

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
before you try to do it if it's armed

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.099 
before you try to do it if it's armed
you<00:00:17.310> won't<00:00:17.550> get<00:00:17.820> into<00:00:18.150> programming

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
you won't get into programming

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.220 
you won't get into programming
now<00:00:19.800> there's<00:00:20.220> two<00:00:20.490> codes<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.359> alarm<00:00:21.660> one

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
now there's two codes on the alarm one

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.439 
now there's two codes on the alarm one
is<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:22.619> programming<00:00:23.369> code<00:00:23.640> it's<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> four

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
is your programming code it's a four

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.920 
is your programming code it's a four
digit<00:00:24.960> code<00:00:25.550> default<00:00:26.550> set<00:00:26.910> to<00:00:27.240> eight<00:00:27.449> eight

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
digit code default set to eight eight

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.040 
digit code default set to eight eight
eight<00:00:28.470> eight<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.340> there's<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.269> user<00:00:30.599> code

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
eight eight and there's a user code

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.910 
eight eight and there's a user code
default<00:00:31.830> sets<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.840> one-two-three-four<00:00:33.920> when

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
default sets of one-two-three-four when

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.880 
default sets of one-two-three-four when
you<00:00:35.130> are<00:00:35.340> setting<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.180> own<00:00:36.210> codes<00:00:36.870> keep<00:00:37.590> them

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you are setting your own codes keep them

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.420 
you are setting your own codes keep them
separate<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:38.989> from<00:00:39.989> default<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.980> go<00:00:41.129> into

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
separate so from default to go into

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.330 
separate so from default to go into
program<00:00:42.000> code<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:42.960> would<00:00:43.260> be<00:00:43.559> from<00:00:44.129> the

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
program code it would be from the

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.750 
program code it would be from the
disarmed<00:00:45.059> state<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.780> would<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.340> eight<00:00:47.340> eight

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
disarmed state it would be eight eight

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.750 
disarmed state it would be eight eight
eight<00:00:48.090> eight<00:00:48.629> and<00:00:48.960> then<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.289> hash<00:00:49.500> button<00:00:49.860> so

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
eight eight and then the hash button so

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
eight eight and then the hash button so
that<00:00:50.789> would<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.420> using<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> keypad<00:00:52.949> behind

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
that would be using the keypad behind

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
that would be using the keypad behind
the<00:00:53.579> flap<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.390> would<00:00:54.690> be<00:00:54.870> eight<00:00:55.199> eight<00:00:55.710> eight

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
the flap it would be eight eight eight

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.069 
the flap it would be eight eight eight
eight<00:00:56.699> hash<00:00:58.760> that<00:00:59.760> then<00:01:00.120> goes<00:01:00.449> into

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
eight hash that then goes into

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.130 
eight hash that then goes into
programming<00:01:01.559> mode<00:01:02.039> where<00:01:02.789> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.329> carry<00:01:03.930> out

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
programming mode where you can carry out

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.649 
programming mode where you can carry out
all<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.439> programming<00:01:05.220> once<00:01:06.030> you<00:01:06.299> in<00:01:06.450> that

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
all the programming once you in that

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.609 
all the programming once you in that
mode<00:01:07.010> get<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.220> manual<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.110> our<00:01:10.110> advice

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
mode get your manual and our advice

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.289 
mode get your manual and our advice
would<00:01:11.010> be<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:12.000> one<00:01:13.100> item<00:01:14.100> at<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> time<00:01:14.430> not

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
would be to do one item at a time not

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.570 
would be to do one item at a time not
worrying<00:01:15.780> about<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.710> second<00:01:17.130> one<00:01:17.250> until

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
worrying about the second one until

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.149 
worrying about the second one until
you've<00:01:17.790> done<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.500> simply<00:01:20.130> go

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
you've done the first one so simply go

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.270 
you've done the first one so simply go
through<00:01:20.369> each<00:01:21.299> list<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.680> book<00:01:22.920> that's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
through each list in the book that's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
through each list in the book that's
relevant<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.000> how<00:01:24.299> you<00:01:24.360> want<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.229> work<00:01:25.259> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
relevant to how you want it to work and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.600 
relevant to how you want it to work and
from<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.119> program<00:01:27.689> code<00:01:28.020> just<00:01:28.950> follow<00:01:29.310> the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
from the program code just follow the

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.390 
from the program code just follow the
simple<00:01:30.119> instructions<00:01:30.259> in<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.740> manual<00:01:31.770> but

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
simple instructions in the manual but

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.109 
simple instructions in the manual but
our<00:01:32.880> advice<00:01:33.299> is<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.780> do<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.229> of<00:01:34.259> time<00:01:34.850> just<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
our advice is to do one of time just so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:38.780 
our advice is to do one of time just so
you<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.509> used<00:01:36.780> to<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.049> after<00:01:37.770> you've<00:01:38.340> done<00:01:38.579> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
you get used to it after you've done the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.450 
you get used to it after you've done the
programming<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:40.140> simply<00:01:40.740> press<00:01:41.460> star<00:01:42.049> hash

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
programming you simply press star hash

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.179 
programming you simply press star hash
and<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:45.360> takes<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.899> out<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.189> programming

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
and that takes you out to programming

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.910 
and that takes you out to programming
and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:48.180> if<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.630> want<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.899> go<00:01:49.140> back<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.619> again

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
and then if you want to go back in again

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
and then if you want to go back in again
just<00:01:50.310> eight<00:01:51.060> eight<00:01:51.600> eight<00:01:51.899> eight<00:01:52.350> hash<00:01:53.750> and<00:01:54.750> do

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
just eight eight eight eight hash and do

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.389 
just eight eight eight eight hash and do
another<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.070> then<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.729> go<00:01:56.909> out<00:01:57.439> -<00:01:58.439> very

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
another one and then to go out - very

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.870 
another one and then to go out - very
simple<00:01:59.820> to<00:02:00.180> program<00:02:00.509> if<00:02:01.170> you<00:02:01.439> do<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.890> bit<00:02:02.610> at<00:02:02.790> a

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
simple to program if you do it bit at a

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.909 
simple to program if you do it bit at a
time
