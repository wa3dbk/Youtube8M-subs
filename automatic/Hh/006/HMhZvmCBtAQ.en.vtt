which<00:01:38.800> is<00:01:38.950> pretty<00:01:39.100> cool<00:01:39.340> um<00:01:40.080> the<00:01:41.080> scuba<00:01:41.740> scuba

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
which is pretty cool um the scuba scuba

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.840

tank allows you to breathe underwater so
if<00:01:45.970> we<00:01:46.060> go<00:01:46.210> into<00:01:46.390> game<00:01:46.630> mode<00:01:46.660> one<00:01:46.960> here<00:01:47.170> I<00:01:47.970> mean

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
if we go into game mode one here I mean

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.960 
if we go into game mode one here I mean
zero<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:49.650> think<00:01:50.650> it<00:01:50.710> takes<00:01:50.920> durability<00:01:51.400> from

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
zero I think it takes durability from

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.540 
zero I think it takes durability from
here<00:01:52.210> yeah<00:01:53.200> so<00:01:53.380> you<00:01:53.440> can<00:01:53.620> stow<00:01:53.860> on<00:01:54.010> order<00:01:54.280> and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:54.550 
here yeah so you can stow on order and

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.700 
here yeah so you can stow on order and
go<00:01:55.450> pretty<00:01:55.630> fast<00:01:55.840> someone's<00:01:56.350> like<00:01:56.440> create<00:01:56.650> a

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
go pretty fast someone's like create a

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.430 
go pretty fast someone's like create a
flight<00:01:57.030> at<00:01:58.030> a<00:01:58.060> wetsuit<00:01:58.540> lets<00:01:58.870> you<00:01:59.110> break

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
flight at a wetsuit lets you break

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.250 
flight at a wetsuit lets you break
blocks<00:01:59.650> faster<00:02:00.100> underwater<00:02:00.310> and<00:02:01.260> the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
blocks faster underwater and the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.330 
blocks faster underwater and the
flippers<00:02:02.740> let<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:04.020> Han<00:02:05.020> fly<00:02:05.590> to<00:02:05.650> run<00:02:05.890> in<00:02:06.070> order

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
flippers let you Han fly to run in order

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.890 
flippers let you Han fly to run in order
like<00:02:06.490> you're<00:02:06.670> flying<00:02:06.820> creative<00:02:07.240> mode<00:02:07.390> so<00:02:07.630> you

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
like you're flying creative mode so you

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.620 
like you're flying creative mode so you
get<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> break<00:02:08.350> stuff<00:02:08.590> like<00:02:08.800> pretty<00:02:09.130> easily

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:09.630 
get to break stuff like pretty easily

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:16.140 
get to break stuff like pretty easily
pretty<00:02:10.630> cool<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:12.300> game<00:02:13.300> moved<00:02:13.600> one<00:02:14.020> again<00:02:15.150> so

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
pretty cool and game moved one again so

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.210 
pretty cool and game moved one again so
let's<00:02:17.050> go<00:02:17.170> back<00:02:17.320> over<00:02:17.410> here<00:02:17.680> yeah<00:02:17.950> so<00:02:18.130> we

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
let's go back over here yeah so we

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.620 
let's go back over here yeah so we
already<00:02:18.430> said<00:02:18.700> the<00:02:18.850> air<00:02:18.970> pump<00:02:19.209> and<00:02:19.390> the<00:02:19.420> air

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:19.630 
already said the air pump and the air

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.920 
already said the air pump and the air
pump<00:02:19.810> is<00:02:20.020> Kree<00:02:20.380> didn't<00:02:20.680> like<00:02:20.830> this<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> you're

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
pump is Kree didn't like this so you're

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.360 
pump is Kree didn't like this so you're
gonna<00:02:23.050> need<00:02:23.200> some<00:02:23.260> iron<00:02:23.740> wheels<00:02:23.950> which<00:02:24.220> are

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
gonna need some iron wheels which are

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.060 
gonna need some iron wheels which are
for<00:02:24.790> iron<00:02:25.140> you<00:02:26.140> need<00:02:26.320> some<00:02:26.470> glass<00:02:26.709> and<00:02:27.040> a

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
for iron you need some glass and a

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.580 
for iron you need some glass and a
piston<00:02:27.430> which<00:02:27.610> is<00:02:27.760> made<00:02:27.910> like<00:02:28.060> this<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.630> then

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
piston which is made like this and then

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:30.870 
piston which is made like this and then
the<00:02:29.860> last<00:02:30.010> thing<00:02:30.190> you're<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.610> need<00:02:30.730> is

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
the last thing you're going to need is

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:35.610 
the last thing you're going to need is
the<00:02:31.000> air<00:02:31.030> compression<00:02:31.630> base<00:02:31.930> and<00:02:33.000> which<00:02:34.620> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
the air compression base and which you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.530 
the air compression base and which you
put<00:02:35.920> more<00:02:36.100> batteries<00:02:36.459> in<00:02:36.610> it<00:02:36.700> speeds<00:02:37.090> up<00:02:37.270> oh

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
put more batteries in it speeds up oh

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.420 
put more batteries in it speeds up oh
okay<00:02:38.170> so<00:02:38.230> this<00:02:38.500> needs<00:02:38.680> to<00:02:38.800> be<00:02:38.860> on<00:02:39.040> during<00:02:39.310> the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
okay so this needs to be on during the

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.250 
okay so this needs to be on during the
day<00:02:39.459> time<00:02:39.760> and<00:02:39.820> pretty<00:02:40.060> sure<00:02:40.300> during<00:02:41.140> the

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
day time and pretty sure during the

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.520 
day time and pretty sure during the
night<00:02:41.410> it<00:02:41.650> doesn't<00:02:42.220> work<00:02:42.370> as<00:02:42.580> effectively<00:02:43.530> so

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
night it doesn't work as effectively so

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.590 
night it doesn't work as effectively so
the<00:02:45.370> more<00:02:45.550> batteries<00:02:45.880> you<00:02:46.000> put<00:02:46.180> in<00:02:46.269> your<00:02:46.390> need

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
the more batteries you put in your need

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.120 
the more batteries you put in your need
to<00:02:46.690> put<00:02:46.840> in<00:02:46.930> titanium<00:02:47.230> batteries<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.010> are

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
to put in titanium batteries which are

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:51.060 
to put in titanium batteries which are
made<00:02:48.280> like<00:02:48.519> one<00:02:49.120> iron<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:50.230> redstone<00:02:50.530> and<00:02:50.650> for

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
made like one iron to redstone and for

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.000 
made like one iron to redstone and for
titanium<00:02:51.430> ingots<00:02:51.940> which<00:02:52.120> are<00:02:52.299> made<00:02:52.450> from

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
titanium ingots which are made from

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.949 
titanium ingots which are made from
smeltery<00:02:54.010> and<00:02:54.400> the<00:02:54.940> freezer<00:02:55.299> as<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.780> sell

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
smeltery and the freezer as you sell

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:59.070 
smeltery and the freezer as you sell
last<00:02:56.140> episode<00:02:56.500> so<00:02:57.370> you<00:02:57.700> need<00:02:57.970> to<00:02:58.090> build<00:02:58.239> two

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
last episode so you need to build two

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.390 
last episode so you need to build two
bases<00:02:59.470> next<00:02:59.680> to<00:02:59.739> each<00:02:59.799> other<00:02:59.890> like<00:03:00.100> a<00:03:00.130> double

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
bases next to each other like a double

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.280 
bases next to each other like a double
chest<00:03:00.610> and<00:03:00.820> then<00:03:00.910> on<00:03:01.090> top<00:03:01.209> of<00:03:01.269> Asus<00:03:01.810> put<00:03:02.019> air

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
chest and then on top of Asus put air

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.530 
chest and then on top of Asus put air
compression<00:03:02.680> tops<00:03:03.010> so<00:03:03.910> the<00:03:04.060> base<00:03:04.209> is<00:03:04.239> made

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
compression tops so the base is made

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.190 
compression tops so the base is made
like<00:03:04.840> this<00:03:05.140> you<00:03:05.500> need<00:03:05.709> an<00:03:05.890> iron<00:03:06.100> wheel<00:03:06.370> to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
like this you need an iron wheel to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.640 
like this you need an iron wheel to
titanium<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.560> then<00:03:09.280> for<00:03:09.610> iron<00:03:09.820> ingots<00:03:10.180> and

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
titanium and then for iron ingots and

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.470 
titanium and then for iron ingots and
air<00:03:11.650> compression<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.370> made<00:03:12.850> with<00:03:12.970> one<00:03:13.090> cooling

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
air compression is made with one cooling

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.199 
air compression is made with one cooling
component<00:03:13.959> which<00:03:14.110> we<00:03:14.320> saw<00:03:14.489> make<00:03:15.489> an<00:03:15.640> itouch

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
component which we saw make an itouch

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.970 
component which we saw make an itouch
any<00:03:16.390> battery<00:03:16.750> a<00:03:16.870> piston<00:03:17.320> and<00:03:17.440> three<00:03:17.680> iron

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
any battery a piston and three iron

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.070 
any battery a piston and three iron
ingots<00:03:18.310> then<00:03:18.430> you<00:03:18.519> get<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.700> those<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.870> you<00:03:19.959> need

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
ingots then you get to those so you need

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.449 
ingots then you get to those so you need
to<00:03:20.170> make<00:03:20.320> two<00:03:20.530> of<00:03:20.560> these<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.739> just<00:03:21.040> once<00:03:21.310> out

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
to make two of these and just once out

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.150 
to make two of these and just once out
of<00:03:21.489> that<00:03:21.670> and<00:03:22.320> this<00:03:23.320> allows<00:03:23.590> you<00:03:23.739> to<00:03:23.860> fill<00:03:24.040> up

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
of that and this allows you to fill up

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.280 
of that and this allows you to fill up
your<00:03:24.190> scuba<00:03:24.610> tank<00:03:24.910> which<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.420> got<00:03:25.660> one<00:03:25.840> with<00:03:26.200> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
your scuba tank which I got one with the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.780 
your scuba tank which I got one with the
durability<00:03:26.590> because<00:03:27.100> you<00:03:27.250> have<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.459> make<00:03:27.610> like

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
durability because you have to make like

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.690 
durability because you have to make like
this<00:03:28.030> with<00:03:28.299> a<00:03:28.330> sheet<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.750> aluminum<00:03:28.870> which<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
this with a sheet of aluminum which is

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.020 
this with a sheet of aluminum which is
aluminum<00:03:30.540> ingots<00:03:30.840> and<00:03:31.099> flat<00:03:32.099> steel<00:03:32.370> and<00:03:32.670> just

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
aluminum ingots and flat steel and just

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.809 
aluminum ingots and flat steel and just
yellow<00:03:33.270> dye<00:03:33.480> and<00:03:33.860> you<00:03:34.860> get<00:03:35.040> one<00:03:35.430> with<00:03:35.580> no

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
yellow dye and you get one with no

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.250 
yellow dye and you get one with no
durability<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.360> let<00:03:36.450> me<00:03:36.540> just<00:03:36.690> get<00:03:37.050> one<00:03:37.200> of

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
durability so let me just get one of

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.449 
durability so let me just get one of
those<00:03:37.349> and<00:03:37.650> then<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.830> right<00:03:38.010> click<00:03:38.040> when<00:03:38.370> it

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
those and then you right click when it

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.759 
those and then you right click when it
gets<00:03:38.610> bar<00:03:38.879> so<00:03:39.120> this<00:03:39.239> takes<00:03:39.360> a<00:03:39.540> while<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.930> put<00:03:40.739> a

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
gets bar so this takes a while I put a

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.949 
gets bar so this takes a while I put a
ton<00:03:40.980> of<00:03:41.010> batteries<00:03:41.459> into<00:03:41.640> this<00:03:41.849> and<00:03:42.209> you<00:03:42.810> right

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
ton of batteries into this and you right

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.619 
ton of batteries into this and you right
click<00:03:43.110> and<00:03:43.410> it<00:03:43.769> fills<00:03:43.950> it<00:03:44.129> up<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.940> the<00:03:45.090> mountain

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:45.629 
click and it fills it up to the mountain

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.470
