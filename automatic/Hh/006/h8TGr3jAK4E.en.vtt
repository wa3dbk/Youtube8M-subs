00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
10x optical zoom which was increased

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.850 
10x optical zoom which was increased
from<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.299> SD<00:01:39.900> 4000<00:01:41.299> 3.8<00:01:42.299> X<00:01:42.479> optical<00:01:42.810> zoom<00:01:43.110> and

most<00:01:46.229> likely<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.770> reason<00:01:47.130> why<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.369> baby

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
most likely the reason why this baby

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.100 
most likely the reason why this baby
gains<00:01:48.420> some<00:01:48.689> extra<00:01:49.079> pounds<00:01:50.750> the<00:01:51.750> Canon

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
this year we get the super vivid we get

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.210 
this year we get the super vivid we get
the<00:02:17.630> poster<00:02:18.630> eyes<00:02:18.780> effect<00:02:19.230> there's<00:02:19.650> low<00:02:19.950> light

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
the poster eyes effect there's low light

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.520 
the poster eyes effect there's low light
there's<00:02:20.790> also<00:02:21.000> a<00:02:21.120> long<00:02:21.450> shutter<00:02:21.870> scene<00:02:22.260> mode

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
there's also a long shutter scene mode

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.090 
there's also a long shutter scene mode
so<00:02:22.890> if<00:02:23.190> you're<00:02:23.459> a<00:02:23.490> fan<00:02:23.760> of<00:02:23.790> long<00:02:24.120> exposures<00:02:25.100> you

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
so if you're a fan of long exposures you

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.150 
so if you're a fan of long exposures you
could<00:02:26.250> still<00:02:26.580> take<00:02:27.360> advantage<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:27.990> that

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
could still take advantage of that

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.890 
could still take advantage of that
15-second<00:02:29.160> shutter<00:02:29.610> speed<00:02:30.000> which<00:02:30.420> Canon

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
15-second shutter speed which Canon

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.650 
15-second shutter speed which Canon
needs<00:02:31.080> to<00:02:31.520> increase<00:02:32.520> by<00:02:32.910> the<00:02:32.970> way<00:02:33.180> we<00:02:33.390> need<00:02:33.540> at

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
needs to increase by the way we need at

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.780 
needs to increase by the way we need at
least<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.900> 30<00:02:34.170> second<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.650> a<00:02:34.709> 60<00:02:35.100> second<00:02:35.490> on<00:02:35.610> all

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
least a 30 second or a 60 second on all

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970 
least a 30 second or a 60 second on all
their<00:02:36.120> cameras<00:02:36.540> any<00:02:36.930> power<00:02:37.200> shot<00:02:37.500> is<00:02:37.620> 15

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
their cameras any power shot is 15

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.680 
their cameras any power shot is 15
seconds<00:02:38.430> what<00:02:39.090> the<00:02:39.239> hey

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:41.880 
so seen modes with this camera there's

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.270 
so seen modes with this camera there's
no<00:02:42.060> manual<00:02:42.300> focus<00:02:42.870> we<00:02:43.020> rely<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.380> auto<00:02:43.739> focus

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
no manual focus we rely on auto focus

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.790 
no manual focus we rely on auto focus
macro<00:02:45.209> shooting<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.720> very<00:02:45.989> good<00:02:46.290> we<00:02:46.500> can<00:02:46.650> get

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
macro shooting is very good we can get

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.240 
macro shooting is very good we can get
very<00:02:46.830> close<00:02:47.100> to<00:02:47.340> our<00:02:47.570> subject<00:02:48.570> matter<00:02:48.830> and<00:02:49.830> an

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
very close to our subject matter and an

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:55.010 
very close to our subject matter and an
ISO<00:02:50.730> range<00:02:51.030> of<00:02:51.300> 125<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.610> 3200<00:02:53.610> also<00:02:54.420> aperture

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
ISO range of 125 to 3200 also aperture

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.760 
ISO range of 125 to 3200 also aperture
range<00:02:55.260> is<00:02:55.650> lacking<00:02:56.040> we<00:02:56.520> have<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> 2.0<00:02:57.390> on<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.080> SD

00:02:58.760 --> 00:02:58.770 
range is lacking we have a 2.0 on the SD

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.250 
range is lacking we have a 2.0 on the SD
4000<00:02:59.340> is<00:02:59.550> this<00:03:00.090> we<00:03:00.300> have<00:03:00.420> a<00:03:00.450> three<00:03:00.750> point<00:03:00.989> four

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
4000 is this we have a three point four

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:04.760 
4000 is this we have a three point four
that's<00:03:01.500> about<00:03:01.739> five<00:03:02.100> stops<00:03:03.260> sacrifice<00:03:04.260> we<00:03:04.560> got

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
that's about five stops sacrifice we got

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.830 
that's about five stops sacrifice we got
and<00:03:05.489> they've<00:03:05.850> probably<00:03:06.030> had<00:03:06.239> something<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.630> do

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
and they've probably had something to do

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.220 
and they've probably had something to do
with<00:03:07.350> the<00:03:07.530> zoom<00:03:07.739> lens<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.390> that<00:03:09.390> just<00:03:09.930> means<00:03:10.110> we

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
with the zoom lens so that just means we

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.680 
with the zoom lens so that just means we
have<00:03:10.320> to<00:03:10.410> shoot<00:03:10.620> a<00:03:10.650> little<00:03:10.980> higher<00:03:11.280> ISO<00:03:11.910> but

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
have to shoot a little higher ISO but

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.539 
have to shoot a little higher ISO but
the<00:03:13.049> ISO<00:03:13.470> performance<00:03:13.620> is<00:03:14.100> great<00:03:14.220> on<00:03:14.430> this

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
the ISO performance is great on this

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:15.770 
the ISO performance is great on this
camera<00:03:14.910> and<00:03:15.090> we're<00:03:15.209> going<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.360> get<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.750> that

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
camera and we're going to get to that

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.590 
camera and we're going to get to that
right<00:03:16.590> about<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:20.190> like<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:20.489> SD<00:03:20.850> 4000<00:03:21.480> is

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
right about now just like the SD 4000 is

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.009 
right about now just like the SD 4000 is
the<00:03:21.900> SD<00:03:22.190> 4500<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.519> has<00:03:23.730> a<00:03:23.760> 10<00:03:24.090> megapixel<00:03:24.750> back

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
the SD 4500 is has a 10 megapixel back

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.740 
the SD 4500 is has a 10 megapixel back

illuminated one over 2.3 inch
CMOS<00:03:28.410> sensor<00:03:29.330> so<00:03:30.330> that<00:03:30.360> means<00:03:30.840> great

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
CMOS sensor so that means great

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.220 
CMOS sensor so that means great
low-light<00:03:32.400> shooting<00:03:32.700> did<00:03:33.540> we<00:03:33.690> experienced

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
low-light shooting did we experienced

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.680 
low-light shooting did we experienced
great<00:03:34.470> low-light<00:03:34.860> shooting<00:03:35.070> with<00:03:35.370> this<00:03:35.690> yes

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
great low-light shooting with this yes

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.930 
great low-light shooting with this yes
we<00:03:36.870> did<00:03:37.080> high<00:03:37.500> ISO<00:03:38.040> shooting<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.580> very

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
we did high ISO shooting was very

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.520 
we did high ISO shooting was very
impressive<00:03:39.390> especially<00:03:40.019> for<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
impressive especially for a
