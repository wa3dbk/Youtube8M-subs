00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.730 
these are something naturally occurring
they<00:01:44.520> could<00:01:44.670> be<00:01:44.820> slime<00:01:45.149> mold<00:01:45.540> or<00:01:45.750> jelly<00:01:46.200> fungus

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
they could be slime mold or jelly fungus

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.920 
they could be slime mold or jelly fungus
but<00:01:47.369> no<00:01:47.700> one<00:01:47.880> is<00:01:48.030> positive<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.750> these

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
but no one is positive what these

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.499 
but no one is positive what these
spheres<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.740> for<00:01:50.250> now<00:01:50.399> all<00:01:50.820> we<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.210> say

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
spheres are and for now all we can say

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.210 
spheres are and for now all we can say
for<00:01:51.570> certain<00:01:51.899> is<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.590> they're<00:01:52.860> definitely

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
for certain is that they're definitely

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.780 
for certain is that they're definitely
out<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:53.970> the<00:01:54.180> ordinary<00:01:55.460> now<00:01:56.460> we've<00:01:56.610> reached

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
out of the ordinary now we've reached

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.609 
out of the ordinary now we've reached
out<00:01:57.030> to<00:01:57.060> other<00:01:57.299> sources<00:01:57.780> in<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> biology

out to other sources in the biology

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.649 
out to other sources in the biology
field<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:59.100> try<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.399> figure<00:01:59.670> out<00:01:59.790> exactly<00:01:59.909> what

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
field to try to figure out exactly what

field to try to figure out exactly what
these<00:02:00.810> spheres<00:02:01.140> could<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:02.130> far<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> only

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
these spheres could be so far the only

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.670 
these spheres could be so far the only
practical<00:02:03.090> explanation<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.840> have<00:02:03.990> is<00:02:04.229> that<00:02:04.590> it

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
practical explanation we have is that it

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.039 
practical explanation we have is that it
could<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.890> some<00:02:05.130> sort<00:02:05.340> of<00:02:05.520> fungal<00:02:05.969> growth<00:02:06.299> I'm

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
could be some sort of fungal growth I'm

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.020 
could be some sort of fungal growth I'm
gonna<00:02:07.290> try<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.590> do<00:02:07.920> this<00:02:08.069> quickly<00:02:08.369> you<00:02:08.670> heard

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
gonna try to do this quickly you heard

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.550 
gonna try to do this quickly you heard
the<00:02:09.179> story<00:02:09.450> earlier<00:02:09.509> today<00:02:10.020> didn't<00:02:10.289> you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560

my<00:02:11.129> mother<00:02:11.430> found<00:02:11.730> something<00:02:12.090> similar<00:02:12.270> to

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
my mother found something similar to

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.580 
my mother found something similar to
this

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
this

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.190 
this
and<00:02:13.680> it<00:02:14.459> turned<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.239> they<00:02:15.750> were<00:02:15.780> these

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and it turned out that they were these

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.580 
and it turned out that they were these
air<00:02:16.800> freshener<00:02:17.760> beads<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:19.200> you<00:02:19.290> can<00:02:19.410> buy<00:02:19.530> the

air freshener beads that you can buy the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.309 
air freshener beads that you can buy the
store<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.340> they<00:02:21.060> had<00:02:21.180> fallen<00:02:21.420> out<00:02:21.630> of<00:02:21.690> a<00:02:22.050> bag

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
store and they had fallen out of a bag

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.380 
store and they had fallen out of a bag
that<00:02:22.530> she<00:02:22.709> had<00:02:22.739> and<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.400> rained<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
that she had and it rained and the

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.199 
that she had and it rained and the

rain-soaked upped those air freshener
beads<00:02:27.590> she<00:02:28.590> had<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> Department<00:02:29.459> of<00:02:29.520> Game<00:02:29.640> and

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
beads she had the Department of Game and

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:31.520 
beads she had the Department of Game and
Fish<00:02:29.880> at<00:02:30.360> her<00:02:30.540> house<00:02:30.750> they<00:02:31.080> were<00:02:31.140> taking

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
Fish at her house they were taking

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.259 
Fish at her house they were taking
samples<00:02:31.800> and<00:02:32.370> because<00:02:32.819> they're<00:02:32.970> scary

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
samples and because they're scary

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.759 
samples and because they're scary
looking<00:02:33.660> they're<00:02:33.840> very<00:02:34.110> high<00:02:34.260> Rangeley

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
looking they're very high Rangeley

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.500 
looking they're very high Rangeley
because<00:02:35.040> she<00:02:35.250> thought<00:02:35.489> she<00:02:35.700> had<00:02:35.940> some<00:02:36.209> kind<00:02:36.420> of

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
because she thought she had some kind of

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.350 
because she thought she had some kind of
strange<00:02:36.780> machines<00:02:37.500> there<00:02:37.849> that's<00:02:38.849> my<00:02:39.120> guess

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
strange machines there that's my guess

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.089 
strange machines there that's my guess
that's<00:02:40.140> just<00:02:40.260> a<00:02:40.470> guess<00:02:40.620> but<00:02:40.800> that's<00:02:40.980> only

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that's just a guess but that's only

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.610 
that's just a guess but that's only
based<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.910> kind<00:02:42.630> of<00:02:42.750> ironic<00:02:43.140> experience

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
based on a kind of ironic experience

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.410 
based on a kind of ironic experience
that<00:02:43.800> we<00:02:43.890> also<00:02:44.040> have<00:02:44.310> right<00:02:44.519> well<00:02:44.760> Darlene

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
that we also have right well Darlene

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.390 
that we also have right well Darlene
Darlene<00:02:45.989> told<00:02:46.380> us<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.769> this<00:02:46.980> kind<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.280> a

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
Darlene told us that this kind of a

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.949 
Darlene told us that this kind of a
fungus<00:02:47.910> isn't<00:02:48.269> really<00:02:48.480> something<00:02:48.690> that's

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
fungus isn't really something that's

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:50.600 
fungus isn't really something that's
normal<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.650> this<00:02:49.799> type<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> climate

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
normal on this type of climate

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.309 
normal on this type of climate
maybe<00:02:50.910> it's<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.330> Febreze<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.900> got<00:02:52.080> to<00:02:52.200> get

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
maybe it's the Febreze you got to get

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:58.250 
maybe it's the Febreze you got to get
back<00:02:52.470> to<00:02:52.530> us<00:02:52.799> on<00:02:52.950> this<00:02:53.100> let<00:02:54.060> us<00:02:54.090> know<00:02:55.160> thank<00:02:56.160> you
