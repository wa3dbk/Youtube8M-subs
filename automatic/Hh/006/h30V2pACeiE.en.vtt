00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.800
 I just want to say that ranger is not 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.470
 rudi juliani we needed rudi 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.270
 juliani the first few days we need 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.010
 there was a good mayor in the first few days 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.540
 moreover on was necessary and you here 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.700
 talked about submission 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.950
 let's talk about our powerlessness before 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.770
 face of the elements it was an incredible hurricane 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:50.680
 you could not master everything we did everything 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.360
 what could i fix 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.910
 I can imagine that rudi 

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.760
 juliani took at least one step and without 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:01:01.420
 federal government approval i 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.680
 ranger ranger main engine did not leave 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.040
 the city he sat 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.950
 sat in the city and begged for help and help 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.990
 not come rain rain and wife sahibi communication 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.110

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.030
 didn't work he lemon connection in 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.270
 new york too live it and jules not

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.320
 jam calm down calm you start 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.030
 speak you start a little distant but 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.490
 it is not surprising it should not be 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.890
 surprisingly surprising that the rich 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 white guy do not care about the problems of the poor 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:38.770
 black people they just don't give a damn about arno 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.569
 life george i like you dark 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.459
 I donâ€™t care about lucy or not 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:45.490
 figurative list of people 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:47.500
 the tops will say so the owners of this 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.660
 countries are the true owners of this country 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.119
 forget these fools of voters to them 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.200
 the owner of these countries do not care about beggars 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.080
 black people 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.119
 they don't give a damn and wait a minute it's like Carl 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:00.550
 Marx with me now say the owners 

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.289
 this country is voters you are wrong 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.940
 very much wrong country it 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.550
 country voters those who choose 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:11.740
 soul gone soul and political elections 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:13.240
 this charade this is fiction listen 

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.209
 listen I wanted a minute maybe 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.610
 learn something and political choices 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.910
 elections are usually given to Americans or 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:24.950
 the fact that they have a choice in fact 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.640
 you have no choice in this 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:32.540
 the country once we have touched on this subject in 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:35.000
 my friend lives in new orleans he is black 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.480
 I wrote word for word what he said 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.030
 I think it is important he said after 11 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.220
 september i was american now i 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.709
 turned black again 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:47.690
 I think a stain on the reputation of George 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:51.020
 Bush Junior will be what he lost 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:53.300
 a whole generation of black people who 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.160
 may have felt so 11 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.850
 myself I now I can not believe what 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.580
 bought this shit i think we 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.500
 need to look at the black generation 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:06.170
 people who were born after that 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.150
 Great Fucked Up 2005 Before 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.030
 they began to believe in america as they believed 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.680
 after September 11th, that is, I want to do business 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.709
 just clarify that is according to your 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.480
 George Bush does not care about 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.239
 african americans new orleans quit 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:23.630
 die them so are you different from the new mayor 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:25.070
 orleana who is also black who 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.180
 did not provide residents with food 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.709
 did not prepare buses for aviation 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.620
 george bush first president who 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:36.739
 appointed black state secretary 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.220
 another black appointed 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:44.450
 secretary and I think that all the same more important 

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:46.540
 division into classes from clearly ie times 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.310
 they have more meaning only classes 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.700
 back to Karl Marx again I think 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.440
 what is the class position in america and race 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.440
 interconnected isn't there beggars white people 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.739
 in america it is considered impossible to talk about 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:04.010
 class in america without accepting the fact 

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:06.470
 that most black people are black 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.590
 people in this country is below the line 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.769
 poverty is also impossible to talk about 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:14.890
 what happens in the new orleans without it 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.359
 what are some white conservatives 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.070
 focus on looting and 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.780
 crime instead of 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.190
 focus on that most 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.850
 poor hunted and afraid friend 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.490
 friend but when many many white 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:34.490
 Americans see what happens in 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.810
 new orleans where few black 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:39.800
 criminals are out of control they 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.410
 think of 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.390
 black people behave like this 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:47.620
 I ask a question about looting 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:50.150
 do you agree that there are two kinds 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:53.540
 looting when people steal 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.450
 I go from the store because they die with 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:59.810
 hunger and can die and 2 when people 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.840
 steal a stereo tape recorder you agree that 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.610
 these are two different kinds of looting then people 

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.350
 that go with tv but no 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.570
 electricity so that they look like you 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.050
 agree that there are two kinds of looting 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.040
 oh well i mean your ok what 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.370
 the president issued 

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:19.520
 ultimatum absolute inadmissibility 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.060
 and thus allowed my right 

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.650
 screaming at us liberal media 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.270
 declare this decree gives us the right 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.390
 shoot people without trial 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:31.580
 as if in the midst of the current crisis in 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:34.010
 which people are dying in crowds 

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.780
 sew on our house any black 

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:42.160

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:42.160

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.430

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:52.140
 add 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:56.730
 real looting in this country and 

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:58.860
 This is when the rich steal from the poor sorry 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:02.580
 if you don't like truth and talk 

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.530

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.840

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:13.830
 led by a bandit us and the Nazis 

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:16.380
 president and his government george 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:17.550

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:33.690
 with smiles smiles smiles 

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:36.660
 Germany lost the Second World War 

00:06:33.690 --> 00:06:39.980
 but fascism won believe me my friend 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:42.930
 actually fascism is when a corporation 

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.730
 become government it's like 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:49.110
 what's happening here and 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:50.970
 bil beat sorry i have a question and 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.950
 george george do you think 

00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:54.930
 looting is it normal or not not 

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:56.670
 looking at and here's a hurricane ok 

00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:58.260
 break in somewhere no end of urine 

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.910
 no problems with theft talking 

00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:03.030
 frankly no problems with theft 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.730
 wait a minute munich it's not about 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:08.520
 tom it reminds me of the situation with dj 

00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.110
 it's not that jay was innocent 

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:13.260
 we all know that he killed his wife 

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:16.140
 it's not that marauding is good we 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.940
 we all know that this is a bad thing in priority 

00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:20.490
 and the fact is white people 

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:22.110
 upset about the fact that one 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:24.540
 a black criminal once broke 

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:27.360
 law when there are millions and examples 

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.680
 reverse also millions of people 

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:31.680
 upset about a few 

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.480
 renegades when the spotlight should 

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:36.540
 become at sea â€‹â€‹more important crisis here 

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:38.640
 business proportion that's what we mean 

00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:41.070
 speaking looting nobody protects 

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:43.350
 marauders george he protects marauders 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:45.070
 I have nothing like this 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:48.550
 less 

00:07:45.070 --> 00:07:48.550
 they are crows
