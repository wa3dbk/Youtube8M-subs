on this channel but today we're going to

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.650 
on this channel but today we're going to
be<00:00:13.799> comparing<00:00:14.490> some<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.759> those<00:00:15.000> against<00:00:15.540> each

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
be comparing some of those against each

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.210 
be comparing some of those against each
other<00:00:15.870> first<00:00:16.379> we'll<00:00:16.560> take<00:00:16.710> a<00:00:16.770> look<00:00:17.010> at<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
other first we'll take a look at the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.519 
other first we'll take a look at the
trap<00:00:17.460> to<00:00:17.730> see<00:00:17.880> how<00:00:18.000> it<00:00:18.150> works<00:00:18.390> then<00:00:18.900> we'll<00:00:19.170> test

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
trap to see how it works then we'll test

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.500 
trap to see how it works then we'll test
it<00:00:19.740> in<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:19.980> field<00:00:20.189> and<00:00:20.670> then<00:00:21.029> we'll<00:00:21.150> come<00:00:21.330> back

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
it in the field and then we'll come back

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.330 
it in the field and then we'll come back
and<00:00:21.779> give<00:00:21.990> it<00:00:22.080> a<00:00:22.170> rating<00:00:22.529> based<00:00:22.710> on<00:00:23.039> how<00:00:23.220> it

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
and give it a rating based on how it

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.220 
and give it a rating based on how it
performs<00:00:23.789> we're<00:00:24.390> going<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.570> start<00:00:24.810> out<00:00:24.990> with

and eight dollars on amazon.com and at

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.510 
and eight dollars on amazon.com and at
first<00:00:32.850> glance<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.719> victor<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.559> strap<00:00:34.950> looks

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
first glance the victor my strap looks

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.450 
first glance the victor my strap looks
like<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.090> cheaper<00:00:36.570> version<00:00:37.079> of<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.890> victor<00:00:38.190> Tim

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
like a cheaper version of the victor Tim

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.940 
like a cheaper version of the victor Tim
cap<00:00:38.730> but<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.450> question<00:00:39.840> is<00:00:40.020> does<00:00:40.320> it<00:00:40.379> work<00:00:40.559> as

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
cap but the question is does it work as

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.619 
cap but the question is does it work as
well<00:00:41.250> as<00:00:41.370> the<00:00:41.520> Tim<00:00:41.730> cat<00:00:41.940> with<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.239> baffle

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
well as the Tim cat with this baffle

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
well as the Tim cat with this baffle
system<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.140> was<00:00:43.590> kind<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:43.890> unimpressed<00:00:44.370> with

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
system I was kind of unimpressed with

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.920 
system I was kind of unimpressed with
this<00:00:44.670> baffle<00:00:45.120> when<00:00:45.239> I<00:00:45.300> first<00:00:45.510> looked<00:00:45.750> at<00:00:45.870> it

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
this baffle when I first looked at it

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.680 
this baffle when I first looked at it
and<00:00:46.190> lo<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.340> behold<00:00:47.460> we<00:00:48.000> put<00:00:48.239> it<00:00:48.329> out<00:00:48.450> in<00:00:48.600> the

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
and lo and behold we put it out in the

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.500 
and lo and behold we put it out in the
field<00:00:48.960> multiple<00:00:49.710> times<00:00:49.950> and<00:00:50.250> all<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.969> ever<00:00:51.180> got

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
field multiple times and all we ever got

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.310 
field multiple times and all we ever got
was<00:00:52.020> this<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.789> trap<00:00:54.120> does<00:00:54.480> not<00:00:54.660> seem<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> work

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
was this this trap does not seem to work

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.369 
was this this trap does not seem to work
very<00:00:55.739> well<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.250> for<00:00:57.090> that<00:00:57.270> we<00:00:57.570> are<00:00:57.780> giving<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
very well and for that we are giving it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.209 
very well and for that we are giving it
one<00:00:59.010> mousetrap<00:01:00.000> genius<00:01:00.420> star<00:01:00.840> up<00:01:01.440> next<00:01:02.100> we

one mousetrap genius star up next we

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.490 
one mousetrap genius star up next we
have<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> nest<00:01:02.760> hip<00:01:03.120> trap<00:01:03.449> which<00:01:03.899> is<00:01:04.080> a<00:01:04.110> really

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
have the nest hip trap which is a really

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
have the nest hip trap which is a really
simple<00:01:04.739> trap<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.640> operates<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> fact

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
simple trap that operates on the fact

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.840 
simple trap that operates on the fact
that<00:01:07.020> when<00:01:07.560> the<00:01:07.710> trap<00:01:07.920> is<00:01:08.100> slanted<00:01:08.490> like<00:01:08.640> this

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that when the trap is slanted like this

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
that when the trap is slanted like this
if<00:01:09.210> a<00:01:09.330> mouse<00:01:09.510> walks<00:01:09.869> up<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> end<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.770> will

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
if a mouse walks up in the end it will

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.640 
if a mouse walks up in the end it will
tip<00:01:11.729> over<00:01:12.060> and<00:01:12.450> when<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.869> does<00:01:13.080> this<00:01:13.409> door

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
tip over and when it does this door

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.280 
tip over and when it does this door
slides<00:01:13.950> into<00:01:14.159> place<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.670> locks<00:01:14.880> so<00:01:15.659> looks

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
slides into place and locks so looks

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.410 
slides into place and locks so looks
like<00:01:16.380> a<00:01:16.500> cool<00:01:16.710> idea<00:01:16.860> but<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.610> it<00:01:17.729> work<00:01:17.880> well

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
like a cool idea but will it work well

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:25.289 
like a cool idea but will it work well
watch<00:01:18.780> this<00:01:19.049> video

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:25.299 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:28.749 

as<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:27.770> can<00:01:27.890> see<00:01:28.009> it<00:01:28.130> works<00:01:28.340> but

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
as you can see it works but

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.480 
as you can see it works but
unfortunately<00:01:29.450> some<00:01:29.930> of<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.170> time<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:31.130> also

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:31.490 
unfortunately some of the time this also

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.690 
unfortunately some of the time this also
happens<00:01:34.450> as<00:01:35.740> you<00:01:36.740> can<00:01:36.860> see<00:01:37.040> there's<00:01:37.280> a<00:01:37.340> little

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
happens as you can see there's a little

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.149 
happens as you can see there's a little
bit<00:01:37.880> of<00:01:37.909> a<00:01:38.060> problem<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.810> Ness<00:01:39.020> when<00:01:39.830> a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
bit of a problem with the Ness when a

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.700 
bit of a problem with the Ness when a
mouse<00:01:40.520> instead<00:01:41.060> of<00:01:41.210> going<00:01:41.600> in<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:42.380> hole<00:01:42.500> in

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710 
mouse instead of going in the hole in

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.289 
mouse instead of going in the hole in
the<00:01:42.799> front<00:01:42.979> decides<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:43.549> investigate<00:01:44.119> by

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
the front decides to investigate by

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.060 
the front decides to investigate by
walking<00:01:44.659> up<00:01:44.780> on<00:01:44.930> top<00:01:45.110> of<00:01:45.259> it<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:45.710> can<00:01:45.950> get

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
walking up on top of it it can get

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.740 
walking up on top of it it can get
triggered<00:01:46.520> without<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.299> mouse<00:01:47.420> actually

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
triggered without the mouse actually

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.649 
triggered without the mouse actually
being<00:01:48.170> inside<00:01:48.350> but<00:01:49.220> the<00:01:49.700> nest<00:01:49.909> still<00:01:50.330> works

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
being inside but the nest still works

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.279 
being inside but the nest still works
about<00:01:51.610> 60%<00:01:52.610> of<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:52.729> time<00:01:53.030> and<00:01:53.240> for<00:01:53.869> that<00:01:53.899> and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:54.289 
about 60% of the time and for that and

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.469 
about 60% of the time and for that and
the<00:01:54.740> coolness<00:01:54.950> of<00:01:55.340> the<00:01:55.520> design<00:01:55.819> we're<00:01:56.330> going

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
the coolness of the design we're going

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.440 
the coolness of the design we're going
to<00:01:56.539> go<00:01:56.659> ahead<00:01:56.780> and<00:01:57.200> give<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.950> three<00:01:58.729> mousetrap

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
to go ahead and give it three mousetrap

genius<00:01:59.869> stars<00:02:00.399> next<00:02:01.399> up<00:02:01.520> we've<00:02:01.759> got<00:02:01.789> the<00:02:02.149> mice

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
genius stars next up we've got the mice

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.350 
genius stars next up we've got the mice
cube<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.140> mice<00:02:03.380> cube<00:02:03.710> is<00:02:04.009> arguably<00:02:04.700> an<00:02:05.000> even

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
cube the mice cube is arguably an even

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.870 
cube the mice cube is arguably an even
simpler<00:02:06.080> design<00:02:06.530> than<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.800> nests<00:02:07.100> it<00:02:07.340> just

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
simpler design than the nests it just

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.850 
simpler design than the nests it just
has<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.060> little<00:02:08.390> door<00:02:08.569> on<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.780> hinge<00:02:09.080> here<00:02:09.170> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
has a little door on a hinge here the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.750 
has a little door on a hinge here the
mouse<00:02:10.069> walks<00:02:10.459> in<00:02:10.670> but<00:02:11.660> it<00:02:12.019> can't<00:02:12.650> get<00:02:13.340> back<00:02:13.550> out

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
mouse walks in but it can't get back out

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.640 
mouse walks in but it can't get back out
because<00:02:14.060> it's<00:02:14.239> only<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.480> one-way<00:02:14.840> door<00:02:15.049> and<00:02:15.290> no

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
because it's only a one-way door and no

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.259 
because it's only a one-way door and no
matter<00:02:15.799> how<00:02:16.010> hard<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> mouse<00:02:16.549> pushes<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:17.120> it

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
matter how hard the mouse pushes on it

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.110 
matter how hard the mouse pushes on it
it<00:02:17.420> won't<00:02:17.840> be<00:02:18.080> able<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.380> get<00:02:18.590> out<00:02:18.739> so<00:02:19.310> let's

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:20.120 
it won't be able to get out so let's

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.370 
it won't be able to get out so let's
test<00:02:20.480> the<00:02:20.810> mice<00:02:20.989> cube

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.730 

as<00:02:28.220> you<00:02:28.400> can<00:02:28.490> see<00:02:28.700> my<00:02:29.240> skew<00:02:29.540> Burke's<00:02:29.900> really

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
as you can see my skew Burke's really

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.940 
as you can see my skew Burke's really
well<00:02:30.920> only<00:02:31.910> issue<00:02:32.120> is<00:02:32.570> since<00:02:33.350> there<00:02:33.530> is<00:02:33.680> no

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
well only issue is since there is no

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.010 
well only issue is since there is no
opening<00:02:34.640> in<00:02:34.910> the<00:02:35.180> front<00:02:35.360> when<00:02:35.660> the<00:02:35.750> door<00:02:35.930> is

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
opening in the front when the door is

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.830 
opening in the front when the door is
closed<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.680> think<00:02:37.100> sometimes<00:02:37.850> mice<00:02:38.540> have<00:02:38.810> a

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
closed I think sometimes mice have a

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.930 
closed I think sometimes mice have a
little<00:02:39.200> harder<00:02:39.440> time<00:02:39.560> smelling<00:02:40.490> the<00:02:40.640> peanut

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
little harder time smelling the peanut

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.610 
little harder time smelling the peanut
butter<00:02:41.060> or<00:02:41.300> whatever<00:02:41.420> bait<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:42.110> decide<00:02:42.440> to

butter or whatever bait you decide to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.460 
butter or whatever bait you decide to
use<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.490> we<00:02:44.210> are<00:02:44.390> going<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.600> give<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.260> mice

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:45.470 
use so we are going to give the mice

really<00:02:49.490> good<00:02:49.700> trap<00:02:49.970> when<00:02:50.240> a<00:02:50.270> mouse<00:02:50.510> does<00:02:50.870> get

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
really good trap when a mouse does get

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.590 
really good trap when a mouse does get
attracted<00:02:51.500> by<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.680> it<00:02:51.950> almost<00:02:52.820> 100<00:02:53.300> percent<00:02:53.390> of

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
the time ends up getting caught last but

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.690 
the time ends up getting caught last but
definitely<00:02:56.840> not<00:02:57.170> least<00:02:57.350> we're<00:02:58.070> going<00:02:58.340> to<00:02:58.490> look

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
definitely not least we're going to look

definitely not least we're going to look
