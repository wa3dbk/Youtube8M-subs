expected<00:02:19.810> to<00:02:19.870> be<00:02:19.989> there<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.380> hopefully<00:02:21.340> we

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
expected to be there but hopefully we

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:22.770 
expected to be there but hopefully we

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739 
but you know I think that the atmosphere

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.199 
but you know I think that the atmosphere
is<00:02:27.069> definitely<00:02:27.400> give<00:02:27.489> me<00:02:27.519> some<00:02:27.730> to<00:02:27.849> remember

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
is definitely give me some to remember

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.240 
is definitely give me some to remember
