sunday night oil was going down and

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.800 
sunday night oil was going down and
testing<00:01:13.770> very<00:01:14.010> crucial<00:01:14.430> support<00:01:14.729> level<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> 64

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
testing very crucial support level of 64

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.980 
testing very crucial support level of 64
and<00:01:16.280> i<00:01:17.280> thought<00:01:17.790> i<00:01:18.030> think<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.390> reason<00:01:18.570> for<00:01:18.900> the

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
and i thought i think the reason for the

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.780 
and i thought i think the reason for the
sell-off<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.560> metals<00:01:19.860> was<00:01:20.070> i<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:20.670> there

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
sell-off in the metals was i think there

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.640 
sell-off in the metals was i think there
were<00:01:20.850> some<00:01:21.000> large<00:01:21.240> index<00:01:21.780> funds<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.619> are

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
were some large index funds that are

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.280 
were some large index funds that are
commodity<00:01:23.220> based<00:01:23.400> and<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:24.330> oil<00:01:24.570> dropping<00:01:25.110> i

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
commodity based and with oil dropping i

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:26.960 
commodity based and with oil dropping i
think<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:25.770> just<00:01:25.920> had<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.250> rebalance<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
think they just had to rebalance and

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.580 
think they just had to rebalance and
part<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.240> that<00:01:27.360> rebalancing<00:01:27.720> affected<00:01:28.500> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
part of that rebalancing affected the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.499 
part of that rebalancing affected the
metals<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.100> that's<00:01:29.549> why<00:01:29.729> you<00:01:29.790> saw<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.119> spike

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
metals and that's why you saw the spike

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.539 
metals and that's why you saw the spike
down<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.409> peter<00:01:31.680> you<00:01:31.860> really<00:01:32.100> beat<00:01:32.280> me<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> my

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
down and peter you really beat me to my

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.730 
down and peter you really beat me to my
next<00:01:32.670> question<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.570> oil<00:01:33.689> prices<00:01:33.840> at<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
next question because oil prices at the

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.370 
next question because oil prices at the
lowest<00:01:35.040> level<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.520> five<00:01:35.880> years<00:01:36.299> how<00:01:36.869> much<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
lowest level in five years how much of a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.620 
lowest level in five years how much of a
role<00:01:37.619> is<00:01:37.829> it<00:01:37.950> playing<00:01:38.280> in<00:01:38.640> impacting<00:01:39.299> precious

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
role is it playing in impacting precious

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
to break 1200 it's broken it twice but

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.550

something else behind this story and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
something else behind this story and
what<00:02:37.329> I<00:02:37.360> suspect<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:38.049> may<00:02:38.260> be<00:02:38.319> and<00:02:38.680> nobody<00:02:38.890> has

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
what I suspect it may be and nobody has

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.330 
what I suspect it may be and nobody has
really<00:02:40.060> played<00:02:40.390> this<00:02:40.720> up<00:02:41.019> was<00:02:41.319> a<00:02:41.590> Moody's

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
downgraded Japanese debt on Sunday night

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.770 
downgraded Japanese debt on Sunday night
I<00:02:45.010> mean<00:02:45.519> I<00:02:45.549> consider<00:02:46.090> that<00:02:46.180> a<00:02:46.329> fairly

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
I mean I consider that a fairly

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.599 
I mean I consider that a fairly
significant<00:02:47.470> storia<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.340> know<00:02:48.459> we're

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:48.609 
significant storia you know we're

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:50.940 
significant storia you know we're
talking<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.209> third<00:02:49.959> largest<00:02:50.260> economy<00:02:50.440> in<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
talking the third largest economy in the

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:53.520 
talking the third largest economy in the
world<00:02:51.040> being<00:02:51.609> downgraded<00:02:52.140> you<00:02:53.140> know<00:02:53.230> that's<00:02:53.410> a

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
world being downgraded you know that's a

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.470 
world being downgraded you know that's a
pretty<00:02:53.709> significant<00:02:54.370> event<00:02:54.609> and<00:02:55.030> nobody's

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
pretty significant event and nobody's

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.210 
pretty significant event and nobody's
talking<00:02:55.870> about<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:56.680> I<00:02:56.769> think<00:02:56.799> that

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
talking about it and and I think that

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.110 
talking about it and and I think that
might<00:02:57.430> be<00:02:57.489> an<00:02:58.030> underlying<00:02:59.099> support<00:03:00.099> for<00:03:01.000> the

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
might be an underlying support for the

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.729 
might be an underlying support for the
metals<00:03:01.420> here<00:03:01.599> at<00:03:01.780> least<00:03:01.989> from<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.319> Far<00:03:02.500> East
