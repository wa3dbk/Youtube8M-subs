how the league table looks like the

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.910 
how the league table looks like the
league<00:04:10.950> is<00:04:11.250> very<00:04:11.760> tight<00:04:12.120> we<00:04:13.080> are<00:04:13.260> only<00:04:13.410> one

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
league is very tight we are only one

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.190 
league is very tight we are only one
point<00:04:14.280> of<00:04:14.580> top<00:04:14.910> spot<00:04:15.300> and<00:04:15.600> we<00:04:15.690> have<00:04:15.810> a<00:04:15.840> very

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200
