00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:55.699 

I'm<00:03:53.459> not<00:03:53.580> try<00:03:53.760> to<00:03:53.790> put<00:03:54.000> some<00:03:54.180> more<00:03:54.270> feet<00:03:54.540> under

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
I'm not try to put some more feet under

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.860 
I'm not try to put some more feet under
broke<00:03:56.280> it<00:03:56.430> off<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.329> can<00:03:57.480> use<00:03:57.659> the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:57.870 
broke it off and you can use the

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.369 
broke it off and you can use the
highlights<00:03:58.290> really<00:03:58.590> strong<00:03:59.930> on<00:04:00.930> top<00:04:01.200> of<00:04:01.319> the

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:01.379 
highlights really strong on top of the

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:07.690 
highlights really strong on top of the
Gil<00:04:01.620> things

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:09.330 

laid<00:04:08.030> out

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
laid out

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:10.530 
laid out
and<00:04:09.430> then<00:04:09.580> we'll<00:04:09.700> put<00:04:09.910> the<00:04:10.060> black<00:04:10.270> lines

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
and then we'll put the black lines

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.610 
and then we'll put the black lines
through<00:04:10.930> there

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:14.620 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.240 

so<00:04:15.340> it's<00:04:15.700> like<00:04:16.030> really<00:04:16.840> spiky<00:04:17.440> scheming

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
so it's like really spiky scheming

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.640 
so it's like really spiky scheming
monstrosity

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
monstrosity

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:26.570 
monstrosity
just<00:04:21.300> blend<00:04:22.300> them<00:04:22.479> down

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.770 

I<00:04:27.580> fall<00:04:29.430> I'll<00:04:30.430> put<00:04:30.670> up<00:04:30.820> some<00:04:30.880> pictures<00:04:31.450> at<00:04:31.630> the

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
I fall I'll put up some pictures at the

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:33.180 
I fall I'll put up some pictures at the
end<00:04:31.810> of<00:04:32.110> this<00:04:32.200> that<00:04:32.470> shows<00:04:32.800> though<00:04:33.010> that

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
end of this that shows though that

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.100 
end of this that shows though that
Stacey<00:04:33.520> did<00:04:33.850> that<00:04:34.030> kind<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.270> got<00:04:34.390> jacked<00:04:34.660> up<00:04:34.900> by

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
Stacey did that kind of got jacked up by

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.270 
Stacey did that kind of got jacked up by
itching<00:04:35.560> but<00:04:36.570> had<00:04:37.570> some<00:04:37.840> fake<00:04:38.080> eyes<00:04:38.290> that

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
itching but had some fake eyes that

00:04:39.280 --> 00:05:04.450 
itching but had some fake eyes that
maybe

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:04.460 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.680 

all<00:05:05.270> right<00:05:05.570> and<00:05:07.780> some<00:05:08.780> scales<00:05:09.260> I<00:05:09.680> start<00:05:10.070> at<00:05:10.160> the

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:10.690 
all right and some scales I start at the

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:13.140 
all right and some scales I start at the
inside<00:05:11.690> of<00:05:11.810> the<00:05:11.930> eye<00:05:11.960> and<00:05:12.470> make<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.710> couple

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
inside of the eye and make a couple

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:15.850 
inside of the eye and make a couple
views<00:05:14.150> and<00:05:14.570> just<00:05:14.600> keep<00:05:14.870> layering<00:05:15.110> these<00:05:15.440> on

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
views and just keep layering these on

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:18.160 
views and just keep layering these on
top<00:05:16.070> of<00:05:16.220> each<00:05:16.340> other<00:05:16.520> they<00:05:17.510> can<00:05:17.690> go<00:05:17.780> from<00:05:17.990> the

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
top of each other they can go from the

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:19.960 
top of each other they can go from the
sign<00:05:18.470> it's<00:05:18.770> a<00:05:18.860> bigger<00:05:19.070> a<00:05:19.250> bigger<00:05:19.340> this<00:05:19.670> thing

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 
sign it's a bigger a bigger this thing

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:28.010 
sign it's a bigger a bigger this thing
and<00:05:20.960> I<00:05:21.110> think

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.140 

and<00:05:28.620> then<00:05:28.770> I<00:05:28.920> need<00:05:29.070> to<00:05:29.190> draw<00:05:29.340> these<00:05:29.520> lines<00:05:29.820> on

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
and then I need to draw these lines on

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:31.420 
and then I need to draw these lines on
his<00:05:30.270> nose

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
his nose

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:54.070 
his nose
they're<00:05:32.430> just<00:05:32.580> later<00:05:35.870> angles

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:56.649 

blend<00:05:54.949> out<00:05:55.099> of<00:05:55.189> the<00:05:55.280> line<00:05:55.520> oh<00:05:55.849> I<00:05:56.120> don't<00:05:56.479> know

00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:56.659 
blend out of the line oh I don't know

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:06.050 
blend out of the line oh I don't know
okay

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:06.060 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.940 

and<00:06:06.540> end<00:06:06.990> up<00:06:07.080> with<00:06:07.260> some<00:06:07.410> teeth<00:06:07.650> in<00:06:07.830> there

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:10.950 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.220 

it's<00:06:11.340> too<00:06:11.610> sloppy<00:06:11.910> right<00:06:12.300> now<00:06:12.420> and<00:06:13.020> then<00:06:13.170> I

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:13.230 
it's too sloppy right now and then I

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:16.640 
it's too sloppy right now and then I
just<00:06:13.410> highlight<00:06:13.830> the<00:06:15.080> nostrils<00:06:16.080> to<00:06:16.350> get<00:06:16.440> those
