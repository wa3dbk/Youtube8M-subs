00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.710
 Galileo program loves 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.909
 unexpected experiments 

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:13.639
 no luck today and I will be touring 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.059
 winner of the championship of Russia in ski 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:17.039
 racing 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.320
 we decided to check how much load 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.409
 stand his skis 

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.299
 than we will experience them fighting 

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:27.869
 tank t 80 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.949
 Miass 40 for this rub 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.949
 so payments against tracks 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.840
 manufacturers of these skis assure that their 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.000
 products can easily withstand the remains 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 is it true 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.920
 and if true 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.920
 then what is the secret of strength 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.370
 But from these plates and made 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.700
 core 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.930
 this is the basis of skiing the only detail 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.830
 where the tree is still not used 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.220
 It is obvious 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.700
 it is the most waterproof and does not emit tar when 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:08.850
 processing 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.850
 startup boards and stretches 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.790
 and it turns out that such an edge with 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.430
 teeth 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:18.840
 they are then coated with glue 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.810
 now the boards and just grooved 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.860
 fix 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 we prune generations we press the press 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.400
 However, from the short planks 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.280
 since it is the basis of skiing 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.050
 maybe it's all about her 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.050
 and she is so strong 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.730
 miracle did not happen 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.690
 then machine with programmatically numeric 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.470
 of management 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.590
 to process one blank 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.590
 it takes only 40 seconds 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.979
 it is easily controlled by six different os 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.620
 tools 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.730
 but in this case we need only two 

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.880
 prizes and saw 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.880
 they are served from a revolving 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:09.630
 drum 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.349
 on automatic machine translation 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.969
 Precision Jewelery Season 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.169
 Danish extra millimeters as in 

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:19.290
 horizontal and vertical 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.799
 planes 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.699
 grieved like this and red cheeks settles 

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:25.879
 small chips 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.349
 and what is inside 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.379
 but practice by mouth is on its own 

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:34.949
 not durable 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.949
 got off easy 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:42.829
 but if there are 10 of them and each is soaked 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.969
 varnish and glue with his bare hands are no longer 

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:48.969
 will take 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:55.909
 got steel stronger this semi-finished 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.079
 earlier were hasty assurances 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.029
 manufacturers 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.669
 here fouls it appears the juice from 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:12.569
 plastic 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.569
 it is glued to the core of the silicones 

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:20.239
 she this machine to the most flame 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:22.469
 at a temperature of 30 degrees 

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:23.989
 process the sliding 

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:26.199
 surface above 

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:28.799
 it is made of polyethylene 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.849
 but unusual azn graphite additive 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.579
 that's why the tape is so black 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.439
 the more to play it and the further 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:39.919
 it will be better to slide you 

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.759
 following words and glass laminate 

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:45.329
 one of the most durable materials 

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.219
 maybe the secret is in it 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:50.790
 the tape operas fends to make it the best 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:53.790
 stuck 

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.439
 now all your skis can be detached 

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.759
 sliding surface first 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.969
 area fact rejected 

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.499
 each has his coat 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:06.679
 heavy duty glue 

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:09.089
 and finally feed the new core with 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:11.079
 cardboard inserts 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.739
 and on top is the last layer of high 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.620
 molecular plastic 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.370
 gathered in their sandwiches are laid in 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:20.549
 aluminum profile 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.509
 which gives the ski the right 

00:04:22.509 --> 00:04:25.699
 geometric shape 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:28.860
 then closed with a steel plate 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:31.439
 clamp and leave all who are now on 

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:34.439
 twenty two minutes 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:38.469
 and we will not do another test 

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:41.800
 this piston is imitating the push of athletes 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:44.280
 if you sum up the strength of all strikes 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.180
 will turn out 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.600
 what every minute 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.970
 on the ski track previously fgiu weight 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.159
 half a ton 

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:52.120
 but Astana 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.509
 80 times harder 

00:04:54.509 --> 00:04:57.779
 will survive 

00:04:57.779 --> 00:05:01.080
 I'll see pruned around the edges and trimmed chrome 

00:05:02.389 --> 00:05:04.569
 on this machine cause small 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:05.860
 notches 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:08.330
 on the nasty circle is filled with drawing 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.500
 which it carries over to graphite 

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.719
 polyethylene 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:14.839
 sliding surface above 

00:05:14.839 --> 00:05:17.449
 and shavings resin etsa water 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.930
 came out with such a filling unlike 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:22.539
 Absolutely smooth will never 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:25.539
 slip 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.259
 here you do he draws a picture 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.259
 paint is stencilled 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:37.159
 and here is a sign of quality Galileo 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.719
 this is alacon filling machines 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:43.360
 everything came out covers so thin film and 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:44.069
 okay 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:45.860
 that it is almost invisible 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.860
 and sent to dry 

00:05:50.249 --> 00:05:52.529
 then almost tanning bed 

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:55.529
 ski and sunbathe under the rays of ultraviolet 

00:05:57.449 --> 00:05:59.379
 final tests 

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:02.379
 start the engine 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:09.279
 stood it 

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:12.279
 but what made her so strong 

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:16.409
 open the secret 

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:17.369
 take a look 

00:06:17.369 --> 00:06:19.739
 at one of the last stages we 

00:06:19.739 --> 00:06:21.259
 send under the press 

00:06:21.259 --> 00:06:23.289
 people keep at a temperature of 100 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:24.589
 degrees 

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.639
 pause on skis 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:28.689
 five times the excess without 

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:30.979
 tanks 

00:06:30.979 --> 00:06:33.499
 but to help and care of these twists 

00:06:33.499 --> 00:06:35.490
 they give it the necessary bend 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.490
 in the middle 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:42.189
 under the influence of heat and pressure all 

00:06:42.189 --> 00:06:44.669
 I donâ€™t sleep 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:46.569
 gets fantastic 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:49.569
 strength 

00:06:49.569 --> 00:06:52.860
 you can again ski 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.930
 look like a new record 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.930
 and also we will test next time
