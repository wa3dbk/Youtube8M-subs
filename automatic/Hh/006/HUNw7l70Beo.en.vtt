we<00:00:09.480> have<00:00:09.660> always<00:00:09.840> thought<00:00:10.200> of<00:00:10.260> design<00:00:10.889> as

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we have always thought of design as

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.870 
we have always thought of design as
being<00:00:11.840> so<00:00:12.840> much<00:00:13.049> more<00:00:13.380> than<00:00:13.679> just<00:00:13.730> the<00:00:14.730> way

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
being so much more than just the way

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.830 
being so much more than just the way
something<00:00:15.210> looks<00:00:18.770> it's<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.039> whole<00:00:20.220> thing<00:00:20.840> the

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
something looks it's the whole thing the

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.840 
something looks it's the whole thing the
way<00:00:21.960> something<00:00:22.410> actually<00:00:22.590> works<00:00:22.890> on<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:23.789> many

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
way something actually works on so many

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.359 
way something actually works on so many
different<00:00:24.300> levels

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.690 

ultimately<00:00:30.369> of<00:00:30.610> course<00:00:31.020> design<00:00:32.020> defines<00:00:32.700> so

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:33.700 
ultimately of course design defines so

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:46.010 
ultimately of course design defines so
much<00:00:34.030> of<00:00:34.270> our<00:00:34.390> experience

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.120 

I<00:00:46.080> think<00:00:46.860> there<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.640> profound<00:00:48.510> and<00:00:49.140> enduring

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
I think there is a profound and enduring

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:56.020 
I think there is a profound and enduring
beauty<00:00:51.320> in<00:00:52.320> simplicity<00:00:53.150> in<00:00:54.150> clarity<00:00:54.930> in

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.380 
beauty in simplicity in clarity in
efficiency<00:00:57.030> true<00:00:57.870> simplicity<00:00:58.280> is<00:00:59.390> derived

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
efficiency true simplicity is derived

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.979 
efficiency true simplicity is derived
from<00:01:00.690> so<00:01:01.380> much<00:01:01.620> more<00:01:02.450> than<00:01:03.450> just<00:01:03.690> the<00:01:03.840> absence

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
from so much more than just the absence

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.800 
from so much more than just the absence
of<00:01:04.410> clutter<00:01:04.680> and<00:01:04.890> ornamentation<00:01:05.550> it's<00:01:06.510> about

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:14.190 
of clutter and ornamentation it's about
bringing<00:01:07.110> order<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:08.060> complexity

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.850 

iOS<00:01:15.200> 7<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.460> clear<00:01:16.970> representation<00:01:17.930> of<00:01:18.650> these

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
iOS 7 is a clear representation of these

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.350 
iOS 7 is a clear representation of these

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
goals it has a whole new structure that

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.710 
goals it has a whole new structure that
is<00:01:26.510> coherent<00:01:27.350> and<00:01:27.590> that<00:01:28.490> is<00:01:28.610> applied<00:01:29.060> across

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.440 

we've<00:01:42.049> considered<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:43.219> tiniest<00:01:43.909> details

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
we've considered the tiniest details

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.279 
we've considered the tiniest details
like<00:01:45.350> refining<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:45.979> typography<00:01:47.140> to<00:01:48.140> much

00:01:48.279 --> 00:01:48.289 
like refining the typography to much

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:51.340 
like refining the typography to much
larger<00:01:48.560> ones<00:01:49.039> by<00:01:49.610> redesigning<00:01:50.299> all<00:01:50.630> the<00:01:50.869> icons

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:51.350 
larger ones by redesigning all the icons

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.819 
larger ones by redesigning all the icons
and<00:01:52.179> developing<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.270> grid<00:01:53.509> system<00:01:53.780> allowed<00:01:54.649> us

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:54.829 
and developing a grid system allowed us

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:57.029 
and developing a grid system allowed us
to<00:01:54.860> achieve<00:01:55.429> a<00:01:55.729> much<00:01:56.119> more<00:01:56.149> harmonious

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
to achieve a much more harmonious

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.029 
to achieve a much more harmonious
relationship<00:01:58.039> between<00:01:58.429> individual<00:01:59.420> elements

relationship between individual elements

relationship between individual elements
we've<00:02:01.039> also<00:02:01.369> incorporated<00:02:01.880> a<00:02:02.539> whole<00:02:02.990> new
