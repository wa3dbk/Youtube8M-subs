00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:07.760
 ever thought about it 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.320
 Christmas in other languages means 

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:15.030
 no, but I am so indirectly so you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.980
 also on the coming christmas too 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.860
 can communicate internationally 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:32.820
 now before christmas in so many 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:41.059
 I already told something from the language 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:41.059
 she misplaced navi king 

00:00:44.359 --> 00:00:57.870
 laetare activity at quisma cinéma das 

00:00:54.749 --> 00:01:02.010
 By the way , I'm not that way 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:03.449
 iby a lot to the video 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.460
 that was one thing 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.990
 community action on facebook and me 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.590
 Thank you all for submitting your video 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.960
 to have 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.670
 very clever foxes and have noticed 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.710
 that a couple of course you have in mainz 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.360
 if the calendar is missing something 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.400
 Another thing is that I always know that 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.510
 can still guess 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:23.580
 focus focus well in any case is the 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.600
 my complete eye once here 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.370
 swollen 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.380
 to 1 and that I was deadly sick 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:39.300
 last week yes I do not know what 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:40.770
 she with the focus I always think that 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.330
 I will still be producing and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.140
 then still will submit no 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.560
 Sun 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.300
 they'll be out of the war soon 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.340
 currently more messages that mine 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.650
 videos have changed a lot since 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.510
 In the beginning and I can only 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.490
 I could agree with something now 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.260
 postpone it because of yes at some point 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 you change yourself and you do not have 

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:03.900
 but I am not myself 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.180
 I'm satisfied for the moment 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:06.680
 meanwhile the 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.470
 I'm back to everyone 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.130
 Make quality case instead of quantity 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.080
 will 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.820
 i actually wanted main channel concept 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.340
 pull back ie the principles 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:16.850
 how you have commented but that comes 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.860
 guilty 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.080
 but sometimes I think that somehow 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.880
 regulate differently because I'm currently 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.970
 would rather take the time now 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.230
 just during the uni stresses and there 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:29.270
 I am now at the Bafög for 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.740
 finally got an example now 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.410
 slowly catch the apartment 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.660
 that I really prefer him 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.790
 want to do quality instead of quantity 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.830
 and hopefully back to the old ones 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.380
 standards go back and I have there 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:46.900
 already some blogs meanwhile 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:49.220
 I only have to film 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.950

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.910
 year with new blocks with hopefully 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.070
 the old young player goes on and on 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.820

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.590
 happier and already have my good ones 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.150
