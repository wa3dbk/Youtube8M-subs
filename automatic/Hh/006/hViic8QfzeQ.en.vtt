like that which by the way is is surd

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.950 
like that which by the way is is surd
because<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.930> was<00:01:52.140> exactly<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:54.299> could

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
because it was exactly that and I could

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.010 
because it was exactly that and I could

talk about this for a long time but I'll

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.319 
talk about this for a long time but I'll
say<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:58.439> actually<00:01:59.070> was<00:01:59.189> worse<00:01:59.399> on<00:01:59.640> TV<00:02:00.000> that<00:02:00.240> it

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
say it actually was worse on TV that it

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:01.999 
say it actually was worse on TV that it
was<00:02:00.509> reading<00:02:01.049> it<00:02:01.170> if<00:02:01.500> that's<00:02:01.680> even<00:02:01.890> possible

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
was reading it if that's even possible

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.530 
was reading it if that's even possible
and<00:02:03.229> you<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.350> if<00:02:04.500> Mickey<00:02:05.009> ends<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:06.119> final
