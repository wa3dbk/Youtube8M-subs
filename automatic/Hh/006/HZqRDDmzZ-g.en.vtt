so<00:02:31.530> much<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.800> my<00:02:31.860> paper<00:02:32.100> beads<00:02:32.400> which<00:02:32.700> I<00:02:32.820> talk

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
so much of my paper beads which I talk

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.870 
so much of my paper beads which I talk
about<00:02:33.150> in<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> book<00:02:33.750> stitch<00:02:34.170> alchemy<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
about in the book stitch alchemy and

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.190 
about in the book stitch alchemy and
I've<00:02:36.000> been<00:02:36.150> making<00:02:36.270> paper<00:02:36.570> beads<00:02:36.780> for<00:02:36.990> a<00:02:37.050> long

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
I've been making paper beads for a long

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.360 
I've been making paper beads for a long
time<00:02:37.470> but<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.650> thought<00:02:37.800> it<00:02:37.920> might<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
time but I thought it might be kind of

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.890 
time but I thought it might be kind of
fun<00:02:38.580> to<00:02:38.760> do<00:02:38.880> something<00:02:39.240> else<00:02:39.390> which<00:02:39.600> I<00:02:39.690> call<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
fun to do something else which I call a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.900 
fun to do something else which I call a
paper<00:02:40.170> button<00:02:40.620> and<00:02:40.920> you<00:02:41.430> can<00:02:41.550> use<00:02:41.640> these<00:02:41.790> in

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
paper button and you can use these in

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.400 
paper button and you can use these in
all<00:02:42.000> sorts<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.300> projects<00:02:42.690> so<00:02:42.840> what<00:02:43.050> we<00:02:43.140> start

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
all sorts of projects so what we start

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.940 
all sorts of projects so what we start
with<00:02:43.440> is<00:02:43.860> three<00:02:44.700> sheets<00:02:44.730> of<00:02:45.360> book<00:02:46.050> page<00:02:46.410> text

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
with is three sheets of book page text

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.830 
with is three sheets of book page text

got just basic skewer that I'm gonna
used<00:03:08.280> for<00:03:08.460> this<00:03:08.520> process<00:03:08.870> here<00:03:09.870> I'm<00:03:09.960> using<00:03:10.140> a

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
used for this process here I'm using a

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.460 
used for this process here I'm using a
an<00:03:11.550> embossing<00:03:12.060> pad<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.690> you<00:03:12.810> don't<00:03:12.990> have<00:03:13.170> to

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
an embossing pad but you don't have to

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.410 
an embossing pad but you don't have to
use<00:03:14.040> an<00:03:14.130> embossing<00:03:14.340> pad<00:03:14.700> I'm<00:03:14.850> just<00:03:15.030> using<00:03:15.330> it

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
use an embossing pad I'm just using it

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.300 
use an embossing pad I'm just using it
because<00:03:15.480> it's<00:03:15.720> a<00:03:15.780> nice<00:03:15.930> surface<00:03:16.260> for<00:03:17.010> using

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
because it's a nice surface for using

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.010 
because it's a nice surface for using
some<00:03:17.460> boss<00:03:17.610> glass<00:03:17.970> to<00:03:18.209> get<00:03:18.300> both<00:03:18.510> sides<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.930> the

heat gun propped up because that way I

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.130 
heat gun propped up because that way I
can<00:03:45.390> work

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
can work

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.710 
can work
very<00:03:47.560> easily<00:03:47.770> without<00:03:48.670> having<00:03:49.060> to<00:03:49.270> hold<00:03:49.510> my

very easily without having to hold my
heat<00:03:49.870> gun<00:03:49.900> in<00:03:50.140> one<00:03:50.170> hand<00:03:50.320> and<00:03:50.710> I<00:03:50.770> am<00:03:50.860> using<00:03:51.070> a

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:51.460 
heat gun in one hand and I am using a

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:54.270 
heat gun in one hand and I am using a
regular<00:03:52.210> full-size<00:03:53.020> to<00:03:53.590> keep<00:03:53.770> them<00:03:53.920> you<00:03:53.950> could

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
regular full-size to keep them you could

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:55.920 
regular full-size to keep them you could
use<00:03:54.430> an<00:03:54.700> embossing<00:03:54.940> gun<00:03:55.300> and<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.750> take<00:03:55.900> a

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:55.930 
use an embossing gun and just take a

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:57.900 
use an embossing gun and just take a
little<00:03:56.110> bit<00:03:56.230> longer<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:57.310> I've<00:03:57.430> got<00:03:57.580> the<00:03:57.730> Sun

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:57.910 
little bit longer and I've got the Sun

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.850 
little bit longer and I've got the Sun
low<00:03:58.120> typically<00:03:58.690> I<00:03:58.720> put<00:03:58.990> it<00:03:59.080> on<00:03:59.170> high<00:03:59.410> so<00:03:59.680> that<00:03:59.710> I

00:03:59.850 --> 00:03:59.860 
low typically I put it on high so that I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.980 
low typically I put it on high so that I
could<00:04:00.100> work<00:04:00.820> a<00:04:00.880> little<00:04:01.060> bit<00:04:01.210> faster<00:04:01.270> then<00:04:01.810> when

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:01.990 
could work a little bit faster then when

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.460 
could work a little bit faster then when
your<00:04:02.110> gloss<00:04:02.380> is<00:04:02.680> melted<00:04:03.160> we're<00:04:03.700> gonna<00:04:03.820> redo<00:04:04.210> it

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
your gloss is melted we're gonna redo it

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:07.950 
your gloss is melted we're gonna redo it
coat<00:04:05.470> both<00:04:05.620> sides<00:04:05.680> and<00:04:06.490> melt<00:04:07.360> it<00:04:07.510> again<00:04:07.690> so<00:04:07.840> you

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
coat both sides and melt it again so you

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.740 
coat both sides and melt it again so you
get<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.110> nice<00:04:08.380> beautiful<00:04:09.010> coating<00:04:09.580> on<00:04:10.510> both

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
get a nice beautiful coating on both

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.390 
get a nice beautiful coating on both
sides<00:04:11.020> of<00:04:11.200> that<00:04:11.350> and<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.780> want<00:04:13.810> to<00:04:14.280> heat<00:04:15.280> it

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
sides of that and you want to heat it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.180 
sides of that and you want to heat it
until<00:04:16.079> you<00:04:17.079> don't<00:04:17.260> see<00:04:17.440> the<00:04:17.560> little<00:04:17.769> crystals

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
until you don't see the little crystals

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:19.620 
until you don't see the little crystals
anymore<00:04:18.549> until<00:04:18.640> it's<00:04:18.820> fully<00:04:19.030> melted<00:04:19.209> and<00:04:19.510> then

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:19.630 
anymore until it's fully melted and then

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.170 
anymore until it's fully melted and then
if<00:04:19.720> you'd<00:04:19.870> like<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.709> could<00:04:20.950> dip<00:04:21.459> the<00:04:21.609> edges<00:04:21.970> in

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
if you'd like you could dip the edges in

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.820 
if you'd like you could dip the edges in
a<00:04:22.570> different<00:04:23.050> color<00:04:23.200> pepper<00:04:23.470> got<00:04:23.620> a<00:04:23.650> little

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
a different color pepper got a little

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.890 
a different color pepper got a little
bit<00:04:23.920> of<00:04:24.010> gold<00:04:24.190> and<00:04:24.520> just<00:04:25.330> kind<00:04:25.510> of<00:04:25.540> heat<00:04:25.780> it

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
bit of gold and just kind of heat it

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:29.190 
bit of gold and just kind of heat it
super-quick<00:04:26.550> sometimes<00:04:27.550> I'll<00:04:27.730> work<00:04:27.940> with<00:04:28.200> two

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:29.200 
super-quick sometimes I'll work with two

if you use other things you could use
watercolors<00:05:00.610> you<00:05:00.640> could<00:05:00.910> use<00:05:02.280> crayons<00:05:03.280> things

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:03.610 
watercolors you could use crayons things

like<00:05:03.790> that

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
like that

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:06.610

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
the bead and that's what's gonna make it

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:17.640 
the bead and that's what's gonna make it
super<00:05:14.300> shiny<00:05:14.659> and<00:05:15.039> somewhat<00:05:16.039> impervious<00:05:16.879> to
