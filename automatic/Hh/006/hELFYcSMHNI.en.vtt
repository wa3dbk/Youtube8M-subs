stuck so I've got to bite it off to a

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:36.300 
stuck so I've got to bite it off to a
skip<00:01:33.579> so<00:01:34.579> many<00:01:34.819> accidents<00:01:35.179> happen<00:01:35.539> here

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
skip so many accidents happen here

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.270 
skip so many accidents happen here
people<00:01:37.310> try<00:01:37.459> to<00:01:37.490> descend<00:01:37.939> it<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.179> the<00:01:38.270> summer

and<00:01:41.869> I<00:01:41.959> think<00:01:42.140> that<00:01:42.229> would<00:01:42.349> only<00:01:42.439> increase

00:01:42.699 --> 00:01:42.709 
and I think that would only increase

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:44.469 
and I think that would only increase
accidents<00:01:43.340> it<00:01:43.670> encourage<00:01:43.970> more<00:01:44.149> people<00:01:44.450> to

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:03.919 
lot of lichen and moss on it so it's

00:03:03.919 --> 00:03:05.589

the<00:03:06.470> holes<00:03:06.709> are<00:03:06.919> just<00:03:07.040> slabby

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:07.549 
the holes are just slabby

good handholds and even a bit of
overhanging<00:03:12.709> Rock<00:03:13.010> here<00:03:13.269> so<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.299> think<00:03:14.510> retreat

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
overhanging Rock here so I think retreat

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.610 
overhanging Rock here so I think retreat
is<00:03:15.410> the<00:03:15.470> better<00:03:15.769> part<00:03:16.040> of<00:03:16.130> valor<00:03:17.169> no<00:03:18.169> point<00:03:18.470> in

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
is the better part of valor no point in

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:23.059 
is the better part of valor no point in
dying<00:03:19.190> on<00:03:19.430> this<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.989> this<00:03:21.139> is<00:03:21.350> broad<00:03:22.310> stand

00:03:23.059 --> 00:03:23.069 
dying on this so this is broad stand

anyway in summer if you're rock climber
it<00:03:39.359> may<00:03:39.599> be<00:03:39.659> possible<00:03:40.879> but<00:03:41.879> it's<00:03:42.060> very<00:03:42.209> tricky

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
it may be possible but it's very tricky

and a slip has generally very serious or
fatal<00:03:46.799> consequences<00:03:47.730> here<00:03:47.939> so<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> better<00:03:49.019> get
