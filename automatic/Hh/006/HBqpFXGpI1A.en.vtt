then after that you can assemble the

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:54.740 
then after that you can assemble the
flat<00:01:53.220> board<00:01:53.429> in<00:01:53.520> under<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> minute<00:01:53.880> who<00:01:54.360> kind<00:01:54.720> of

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
flat board in under a minute who kind of

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.300 
flat board in under a minute who kind of
found<00:01:54.960> this<00:01:55.110> in<00:01:55.259> France<00:01:55.530> you've<00:01:55.890> had<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.220> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
found this in France you've had it the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.100 
found this in France you've had it the
longest<00:01:56.789> I<00:01:57.119> bet<00:01:57.300> you<00:01:57.390> got<00:01:57.509> a<00:01:57.539> couple<00:01:57.750> tricks<00:01:57.929> up

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
longest I bet you got a couple tricks up

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:18.390 
longest I bet you got a couple tricks up
you're<00:01:58.289> safe

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400

I've<00:02:19.400> seen<00:02:19.550> you<00:02:19.640> guys<00:02:19.760> pivot<00:02:20.150> around<00:02:20.420> and<00:02:20.810> turn

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:20.990 
I've seen you guys pivot around and turn

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.480 
I've seen you guys pivot around and turn
how<00:02:21.260> does<00:02:21.410> that<00:02:21.500> happen<00:02:21.680> without<00:02:22.010> twisting

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
how does that happen without twisting

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.370 
how does that happen without twisting
the<00:02:22.580> hose<00:02:22.760> or<00:02:23.180> getting<00:02:23.510> it<00:02:23.630> all<00:02:23.720> tangled<00:02:24.080> it's

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
the hose or getting it all tangled it's

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.960 
the hose or getting it all tangled it's
actually<00:02:24.740> sitting<00:02:24.950> on<00:02:25.130> a<00:02:25.190> ball-bearing

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
actually sitting on a ball-bearing

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.720 
actually sitting on a ball-bearing
that<00:02:26.209> you<00:02:26.330> can<00:02:26.480> swivel<00:02:26.750> all<00:02:27.020> day<00:02:27.230> on<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:28.400> the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
that you can swivel all day on and the

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.460 
that you can swivel all day on and the
bearings<00:02:29.000> inside<00:02:29.209> are<00:02:29.360> plastic<00:02:29.810> so<00:02:30.170> that<00:02:30.200> they

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
bearings inside are plastic so that they

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.600 
bearings inside are plastic so that they
won't<00:02:30.620> rust<00:02:30.860> when<00:02:31.069> you

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
won't rust when you

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.370 
won't rust when you
right<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.150> then<00:02:33.360> I've<00:02:33.480> also<00:02:33.570> seen<00:02:33.840> water<00:02:34.140> kind

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
right and then I've also seen water kind

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.830 
right and then I've also seen water kind
of<00:02:34.500> spraying<00:02:34.980> out<00:02:35.280> through<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.820> top<00:02:36.000> what's

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
of spraying out through the top what's

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.809 
of spraying out through the top what's
that<00:02:37.020> that

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
that that

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:39.759 
that that
self-cleaning<00:02:38.390> system<00:02:38.900> it<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.319> keeps<00:02:39.439> water

this pretty cool book I'm concentrating

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.120 
this pretty cool book I'm concentrating
a<00:04:15.189> lot<00:04:15.340> right<00:04:15.579> now<00:04:15.730> I'm<00:04:16.030> not<00:04:16.209> gonna<00:04:16.359> lie<00:04:16.570> to<00:04:16.600> you

from<00:04:21.459> just<00:04:21.699> the<00:04:21.820> cost<00:04:22.090> difference<00:04:22.539> this<00:04:22.930> feels

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
from just the cost difference this feels

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.630 
from just the cost difference this feels
natural<00:04:24.020> didn't<00:04:24.920> take<00:04:25.070> me<00:04:25.220> that<00:04:25.250> long<00:04:25.430> to

natural didn't take me that long to

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.170 
natural didn't take me that long to
really<00:04:26.090> figure<00:04:26.240> this<00:04:26.450> out<00:04:26.660> and<00:04:27.410> kind<00:04:27.590> of

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
really figure this out and kind of

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.610 
really figure this out and kind of
laughs<00:04:28.479> down<00:04:29.259> near<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.530> water
