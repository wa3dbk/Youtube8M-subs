00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.980

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.010

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.250
 lame paralytics who waited for the 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.860
 water is stirred I know why an angel came down 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.480
 from time to time and waved the water and 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.180
 the first one that came in after the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.080
 movement of the water was healthy from its 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.600
 wrong whoever this was and was 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:50.710
 there a sick man for 38 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.870
 years jesus seeing him lying and knowing 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.990
 I was sick for a long time you 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.620
 said you want to be healed 

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.450
 the patient answered him sir I did not 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:04.180
 I have nobody to put me in the pool 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:06.990
 when the water shakes while I go 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.399
 or work before me 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:14.640
 said jesus get up take your stretcher and 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:17.610
 walks to the point he was healed he took his 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.450
 stretcher and started walking 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.270
 now that day was Saturday they said 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.200
 for the Jews to the healed man the 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:30.840
 Saturday is not lawful to carry your stretcher 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.500
 he replied he who healed me said 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:36.870
 take your stretcher and walk asked 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.380
 who is the one who told you take your stretcher 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:42.960
 and the healed man walks he did not know 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.140
 because Jesus had retired because of 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.700
 of the crowd that was in that place 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.750
 after this Jesus found him in the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.620
 temple and told him 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.680
 Look, you're healthy, do not sin anymore 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:58.450
 not worse happens to you it was the 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.910
 man and told the Jews that the one who 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 I had healed was Jesus 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.560
 for this reason the Jews attacked 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.619
 Jesus because he did these things on Saturday 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.770
 he replied my father continues 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:14.020
 working and I also worked with what 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.780
 the Jews were still looking for more 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.390
 to die not only because he did not observe 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.090
 on Saturday but because he called God his 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.090
 father equating in this way goodbye 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:29.760
 then Jesus answered and told them in 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.840
 truth in truth I tell you the son does not 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.140
 can by itself do nothing but what 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.260
 what to do to the father but what this 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:42.450
 does the son do it equally so the 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.690
 father loves the son and shows him everything 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.950
 that he does and will show him even more things 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:51.870
 great than these to your amazement 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.180
 as the father raises the dead and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.090
 he gives them back his life so also the son 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.129
 returns life to whoever wants and the 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:02.099
 father does not judge anyone but has given 

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:04.349
 all the judgment to the son so that 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.260
 all honor the son as they honor the 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:09.959
 father who does not honor the son does not honor the 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.480
 father who has actually sent him 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:15.120
 Truly I tell you who hears my word 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.459
 and believe the one who sent me has life 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.370
 eternal and does not come to trial but has 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.859
 passed from death to life in 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.319
 truth in truth I tell you will come the 

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:27.900
 time and we are already in the one in which 

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:30.959
 dead will hear the voice of the son of god and 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:32.880
 those who hurt revive because 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:35.489
 just as the father has in life itself 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:38.040
 himself has also given the son of having 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.560
 life itself has also given him 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.950
 the power to judge because he is the son of 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.510
 man do not be surprised because this will come 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.419
 the time when all those who are in 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.650
 the graves will hear his voice and the 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.810
 who have done good for 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:55.280
 resurrection of life and those who have 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.019
 done evil for resurrection of judgment 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:01.139
 by myself I can not do anything 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:04.769
 I judge according to what I hear and my judgment is 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.410
 just because they do not seek my will but 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.900
 the will of the one who sent me if I give 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.030
 testimony of myself my testimony 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.489
 is true but another is the one that gives 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.070
 testimony from me and I know the testimony 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.709
 what he gives about me is true 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.000
 you send you are linked to Juan and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.670
 he gave testimony of the truth 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.250
 but it's not that a man receives 

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:28.330
 testimony but I say this for 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.750
 your salvation 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:34.720
 he was a torch that burned and shone 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.360
 and you who made us rejoice 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.640
 moment in its light but the testimony that 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.380
 I have is greater than Juan's because 

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.330
 the works that the father has given me for 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:46.300
 carry out and that precisely I 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.210
 he gave testimony of me that is the 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:52.150
 father who sent me the father who 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:56.050
 he sent me he gave testimony of me and you 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:58.870
 I never ye have heard his voice or seen 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.360
 his face neither do you have his 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:04.030
 word dwelling in you since 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.340
 do not believe here in the sending scrutinize 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:09.250
 the scriptures since you think you have in 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.620
 they eternal life are they who 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:14.760
 they bear witness of me and you do not 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:18.210
 you want to come to me to have life 

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:20.490
 glory of men I do not receive but that 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.650
 I know you and I know you do not have 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:24.540
 you the love of god ' 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.300
 I have come in the name of my father and 

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:30.360
 You do not receive me if someone else comes in your 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.450
 own name to that you will receive as 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.460
 can you believe and admit praise 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:39.030
 to each other and the glory that 

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:41.370
 comes from the only god does not seek it jce 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.160
 do not think it's me who is going to 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:46.650
 accuse in front of the father your 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.590
 accuser is Moses in whom you have 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.800

 to me since he wrote me but if not 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.420
 you believe your writings as you will believe 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:02.420
 my words
