analog stick you point to where the draw
is<00:01:35.070> going<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.520> be<00:01:35.670> one<00:01:35.880> two<00:01:36.150> now<00:01:36.659> since<00:01:36.960> we're

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
is going to be one two now since we're

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.719 
is going to be one two now since we're
on<00:01:37.170> our<00:01:37.200> backhand<00:01:37.710> it's<00:01:37.890> gonna<00:01:37.979> be<00:01:38.130> one<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.610> the

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
on our backhand it's gonna be one to the

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.520 
on our backhand it's gonna be one to the
left<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.150> that's<00:01:39.390> been<00:01:39.600> usually<00:01:40.229> it<00:01:40.320> would<00:01:40.409> be

left of that's been usually it would be

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.319

in<00:01:56.040> a<00:01:56.189> quarter<00:01:56.729> circle<00:01:56.969> don't<00:01:57.450> go<00:01:57.600> straight

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
in a quarter circle don't go straight

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.539 
in a quarter circle don't go straight
back<00:01:58.229> make<00:01:58.680> sure<00:01:58.829> you're<00:01:58.950> doing<00:01:59.130> that<00:01:59.250> quarter

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
back make sure you're doing that quarter

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.910 
back make sure you're doing that quarter
circle<00:01:59.939> alright<00:02:00.719> so<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:00.960> lost<00:02:01.140> 2<00:02:01.380> draws<00:02:01.649> in<00:02:01.829> a

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
circle alright so you lost 2 draws in a

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.920 
circle alright so you lost 2 draws in a
row<00:02:01.950> now<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.549> are<00:02:02.640> you<00:02:02.729> gonna<00:02:02.850> do<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.659> got<00:02:03.810> to

how the hell you beat me on the back end
every<00:02:14.510> single<00:02:14.780> time<00:02:14.930> I<00:02:15.140> tried<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.530> forehand

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
every single time I tried the forehand

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.010 
every single time I tried the forehand
turns<00:02:16.130> back<00:02:16.310> down<00:02:16.550> and<00:02:16.880> what<00:02:17.120> he<00:02:17.210> did<00:02:17.450> was<00:02:17.900> he

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
turns back down and what he did was he

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.990 
turns back down and what he did was he
said<00:02:18.230> he<00:02:18.500> would<00:02:18.620> take<00:02:18.770> both<00:02:19.130> analog<00:02:19.700> sticks

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
said he would take both analog sticks

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.460 
said he would take both analog sticks
and<00:02:20.150> go<00:02:20.210> to<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.390> outside<00:02:20.420> the<00:02:20.780> controller<00:02:21.140> so

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
and go to the outside the controller so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.380 
and go to the outside the controller so
he<00:02:21.590> had<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:22.220> right<00:02:22.430> analog<00:02:22.730> stick<00:02:22.880> going<00:02:23.300> to

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
he had the right analog stick going to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.720 
he had the right analog stick going to
three<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.170> as<00:02:24.350> we<00:02:24.470> had<00:02:24.620> before<00:02:24.770> hit<00:02:25.610> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
three just as we had before hit the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.850 
three just as we had before hit the
left<00:02:25.940> analog<00:02:26.360> stick<00:02:26.420> going<00:02:26.960> to<00:02:27.140> nine<00:02:27.380> o'clock

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
left analog stick going to nine o'clock

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.190 
left analog stick going to nine o'clock
and<00:02:28.160> what<00:02:28.670> he<00:02:28.760> would<00:02:28.910> do<00:02:29.030> as<00:02:29.180> soon<00:02:29.360> as<00:02:29.540> I<00:02:29.660> ref

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
and what he would do as soon as I ref

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.080 
and what he would do as soon as I ref
was<00:02:30.410> gonna<00:02:30.560> drop<00:02:30.830> the<00:02:30.980> puck<00:02:31.190> he<00:02:31.670> would<00:02:31.850> rotate

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
was gonna drop the puck he would rotate

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.110 
was gonna drop the puck he would rotate
them<00:02:32.540> both<00:02:32.690> up<00:02:33.020> to<00:02:33.650> 12<00:02:33.950> o'clock<00:02:34.100> now<00:02:34.820> he<00:02:34.880> didn't

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
them both up to 12 o'clock now he didn't

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.760 
them both up to 12 o'clock now he didn't
go<00:02:35.180> straight<00:02:35.240> up<00:02:35.660> you<00:02:35.960> don't<00:02:36.170> go<00:02:36.290> straight<00:02:36.350> up

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:36.770 
go straight up you don't go straight up

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.800 
go straight up you don't go straight up
you<00:02:37.100> still<00:02:37.370> do<00:02:37.520> that<00:02:37.550> quarter<00:02:38.000> circle<00:02:38.390> when

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
you still do that quarter circle when

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.300 
you still do that quarter circle when
you<00:02:38.930> push<00:02:39.110> them<00:02:39.260> up<00:02:39.380> both<00:02:39.830> at<00:02:40.010> the<00:02:40.070> same<00:02:40.280> time

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.310 
you push them up both at the same time

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.610 
you push them up both at the same time
it's<00:02:40.760> a<00:02:40.880> combination<00:02:41.210> between<00:02:41.930> the<00:02:42.320> stick

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
it's a combination between the stick

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.280 
it's a combination between the stick
lift<00:02:42.890> and<00:02:43.130> the<00:02:43.370> push<00:02:43.670> and<00:02:44.420> when<00:02:44.570> it<00:02:44.720> works<00:02:45.020> a

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
lift and the push and when it works a

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.560 
lift and the push and when it works a
ton<00:02:45.560> especially<00:02:46.370> against<00:02:46.820> a<00:02:46.940> guy<00:02:47.210> trying<00:02:47.510> to

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
ton especially against a guy trying to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.020 
ton especially against a guy trying to
win<00:02:47.750> that<00:02:47.870> backhand<00:02:48.440> drop<00:02:48.740> so<00:02:49.460> now<00:02:49.670> you<00:02:49.730> know

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
win that backhand drop so now you know

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.120 
win that backhand drop so now you know
the<00:02:50.270> best<00:02:50.570> two<00:02:50.870> ways<00:02:51.140> that<00:02:51.320> win<00:02:51.470> faceoff<00:02:51.920> see

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
the best two ways that win faceoff see

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.040 
the best two ways that win faceoff see
in<00:02:52.220> my<00:02:52.430> opinion<00:02:53.060> now<00:02:53.210> look<00:02:53.420> at<00:02:53.510> this<00:02:53.630> guy<00:02:53.750> watch

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:54.050 
in my opinion now look at this guy watch

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:55.810 
in my opinion now look at this guy watch
this<00:02:54.260> guy<00:02:54.440> he's<00:02:54.950> bouncing<00:02:55.370> all<00:02:55.460> over<00:02:55.490> the

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
this guy he's bouncing all over the
