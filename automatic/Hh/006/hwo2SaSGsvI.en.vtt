00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 good anyway to a new video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:06.299
 good new call of duty black video 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.980
 ops' we are in black ops 1 and 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:09.300
 basically a pretty gameplay 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.470
 short enough not enough to 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.150
 comment on some little things that would be 

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:17.630
 comment first of all we are in 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:20.560
 feeling range and good I'm with the 47 

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.869
 golden with silencer and other good 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.240
 basically in our game to play 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:28.250
 Pretty people is pretty easy to 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.919
 record them something we say is 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.990
 difficult or anything like that but as 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.490
 you know, I like to go up every 24 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.500
 that the 25 the previous ones that 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:40.310
 generally the ones I like the 4 and the 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.380
 5 for me are my favorite one portrays 

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:42.910
 perfectly good the game one of the 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.370
 first 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.600
 in portraying well we could say the 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.239
 modern war and such and I never mean 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:54.250
 warfare then then some left 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.080
 as they came out some like others 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.760
 no but for me with four then marked the 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.440
 difference is a title that I like 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.510
 a lot of climbing you know that there are many 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.059
 problems to upload that game and upload 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.950
 every 25 in cabot and 4 it costs a 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.250
 heap you with a game costs 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.340
 very much is very very pain of ass you 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.250
 with a game because 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.399
 obama on the line or is full of hacker 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.770
 who plays in the game and is full of 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.189
 people who modify it and I do not know 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.560
 can play crappy games and so on and 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.750
 every 25 for more of the same I do not 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.069
 it costs a lot to enter and record from 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.840
 made last video because it cost me a 

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:33.299
 bunch not together with the day with a 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.399
 game that was not hacked and that 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.859
 it was fine something fine the line with three 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:40.380
 lines I'm perfectly satisfied if 

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:43.289
 was an easy game are not games 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.060
 that really the skill because you see 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:47.009
 rewarded not so much in 4 as in the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.899
 5 against more games and more skill 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:51.420
 Spying with a title that rewards you 

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:53.039
 for them but as you already know it is 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.500
 quite difficult to record I will try 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.429
 upload as much as you can of those two 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.110
 games but basically it's so that 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.829
 Did you know that if I do not upload it's basically 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.729
 that's why the difficulty 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:04.319
 look for a game that we have to 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.300
 simply look for a game to the other 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:11.530
 I tried to put on record with Elijah 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.960
 gaudÃ­ 5 but it was impossible there were 960 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:19.700
 people and I believe that those 960 thousand 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.830
 they were in a small idea is already 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.620
 difficult complicated and they have loaded the 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:27.440
 game between four stupid as they have 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.260
 destroyed and it is very difficult to 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.270
 record upload even play I do not recommend 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.010
 right now so buy those two 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.610
 games yes it is true that they are a whore 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.070
 finally passed 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.040
 I like I say in 4 was when I started 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.470
 play of recognized now and of more to 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.760
 me is an excellent title I liked a lot 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.250
 and I think it's the most hours 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.200
 possibly I have thrown so much 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.720
 private games both competitive and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.630
 both public games has been one of 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.230
 the games that I have had the most hours 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.050
 throw 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.599
 referents that I think ninja gaiden of 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.720
 play 3 is the most we could say 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.430
 Now I've missed three break point 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:10.959
 of price are one of the games that most 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.129
 hours and hours and hours I have put them 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.870
 well basically I wanted to comment on a 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.629
 little bit of request with upload those two 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.069
 games then only that's why 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.440
 will try to upload a cops that yes is 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.450
 easy to find the decent game with 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.829
 a decent connection and looking pretty 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.299
 pretty quick this sketch hoops 

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:28.700
 if you are thinking of buying white 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.129
 shifts or I recommend it perfectly not 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.269
 There is no problem or anything tacna 

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:36.379
 I have seen the truth for the moment 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:38.810
 modern warfare 2 has not tried it and 

00:03:36.379 --> 00:03:40.359
 modern warfare 3 as not proven 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.680
 neither but come on I imagine that 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.220
 similar but black ops spogli is 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.560
 firm 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.840
 to migrate from a title that also me 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.700
 he liked it a lot when when it came up and 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.010
 the rest 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.270
 good if you realize that when some 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.000
 new soldering iron we always go back to 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.420
 earlier and we say that supports it when 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.239
 we say later that it is bad, not for 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.700
 example a lot of people say that said 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:06.110
 the black ops 2 was bad the ghost came out and 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.599
 it gets better speaks coauthor saying that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:11.330
 it's much better and good so it always happens 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.920
 something similar 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:17.530
 so well nothing more kids this has 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.530
 Was everything in the next next video 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:22.690
 yes
