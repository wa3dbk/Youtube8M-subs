00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:25.610 
i apply a burgundy eyeshadow and the

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.160 
i apply a burgundy eyeshadow and the
reason<00:03:25.910> i<00:03:26.000> did<00:03:26.180> this<00:03:26.210> was<00:03:26.780> to<00:03:26.870> bring<00:03:27.020> more

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:27.170 
reason i did this was to bring more

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:28.870 
reason i did this was to bring more
color<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.710> eye<00:03:27.740> i<00:03:27.890> didn't<00:03:28.370> want<00:03:28.490> it<00:03:28.610> to<00:03:28.730> be

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
color to the eye i didn't want it to be

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.450 
color to the eye i didn't want it to be
just<00:03:29.390> black<00:03:29.660> in<00:03:29.960> red<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.650> think<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.010> burgundy

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.460 
just black in red I think the burgundy

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:33.700 
just black in red I think the burgundy
gives<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.210> nice<00:03:32.450> tone<00:03:32.870> to<00:03:33.110> it<00:03:33.260> and<00:03:33.500> draws

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:33.710 
gives a nice tone to it and draws

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:37.210 
gives a nice tone to it and draws
attention<00:03:33.890> to<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:34.490> eye<00:03:35.950> onto<00:03:36.950> the<00:03:37.070> inner

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
attention to the eye onto the inner

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.190
