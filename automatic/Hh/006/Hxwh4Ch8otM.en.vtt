00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
new genes that are stiff the best way to

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.169 
new genes that are stiff the best way to
start<00:00:13.799> softening<00:00:14.040> them<00:00:14.429> and<00:00:14.639> breaking<00:00:15.089> them

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
start softening them and breaking them

start softening them and breaking them
in<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.900> wash<00:00:16.170> them<00:00:16.560> with<00:00:17.310> some<00:00:17.670> fabric

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
about softness or stiffness you might

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.689 
about softness or stiffness you might
think<00:00:25.470> about<00:00:25.590> some<00:00:26.039> different<00:00:26.340> fabric

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
think about some different fabric

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.060 
think about some different fabric

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
soften over time with wear and washing

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.760 
soften over time with wear and washing
again<00:01:24.570> try<00:01:24.990> washing<00:01:25.320> them<00:01:25.409> with<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.560> fabric

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
again try washing them with a fabric

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.260 
again try washing them with a fabric
softener<00:01:26.100> that'll<00:01:26.549> soften<00:01:26.700> them<00:01:27.030> more

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
softener that'll soften them more

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.999 
softener that'll soften them more
quickly<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:28.049> often<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.500> wash<00:01:28.740> them

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
quickly and the more often you wash them

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.560 
quickly and the more often you wash them
of<00:01:29.369> course<00:01:29.729> the<00:01:29.909> more<00:01:30.030> quickly<00:01:30.270> they'll

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
of course the more quickly they'll

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.569 
of course the more quickly they'll
soften<00:01:30.860> this<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.009> also<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> hundred<00:01:32.520> percent

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
soften this is also a hundred percent

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.469 
soften this is also a hundred percent
cotton<00:01:33.509> this<00:01:33.900> already<00:01:34.170> has<00:01:34.470> some<00:01:34.920> pre<00:01:35.670> factory

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
cotton this already has some pre factory

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
cotton this already has some pre factory
kind<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.020> fading<00:01:37.579> going<00:01:38.579> on<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.150> these<00:01:39.329> are

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
kind of fading going on and these are

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.870 
kind of fading going on and these are
probably<00:01:39.990> more<00:01:40.140> likely<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> soften<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> to

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
probably more likely to soften up and to

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.940 
probably more likely to soften up and to
fade<00:01:42.180> a<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:43.200> more<00:01:43.320> quickly<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:43.829> when

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
fade a little more quickly so when

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.260 
fade a little more quickly so when
you're<00:01:44.070> thinking<00:01:44.100> about<00:01:44.520> softening<00:01:44.909> your

you're thinking about softening your

jeans that's usually accompanied with

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.740 
jeans that's usually accompanied with
fading<00:01:47.670> because<00:01:47.820> it<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.299> achieved<00:01:48.659> through

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
fading because it is achieved through

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.389 
fading because it is achieved through
the<00:01:48.869> process<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:49.439> washing<00:01:49.890> them<00:01:50.009> so<00:01:50.189> if<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
the process of washing them so if you

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
don't want them to fade and they won't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.889 
don't want them to fade and they won't
soften<00:01:53.159> as<00:01:53.460> easily<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:54.000> want<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.270> by<00:01:54.390> kind<00:01:54.780> of

this type of fabric if you do then you

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.209 
this type of fabric if you do then you

effects that come along with the

concerned about softness and you haven't
bought<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.630> pair<00:02:06.840> of<00:02:06.869> new<00:02:07.049> jeans<00:02:07.290> yet<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:08.489> might

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
bought a pair of new jeans yet you might

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.490 
bought a pair of new jeans yet you might
try<00:02:08.940> just<00:02:08.970> buying<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.599> pair<00:02:09.840> that<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.319> already

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
try just buying a pair that are already

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.710 
try just buying a pair that are already
pretty<00:02:10.800> stretchy<00:02:11.190> and<00:02:11.520> soft<00:02:11.730> which<00:02:12.480> means

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
pretty stretchy and soft which means

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.559 
pretty stretchy and soft which means
they're<00:02:12.870> going<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.020> be<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> black

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
they're going to be a black

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:15.360 
they're going to be a black
and<00:02:13.659> so<00:02:14.079> this<00:02:14.260> one<00:02:14.499> is<00:02:14.680> ramie<00:02:15.040> cotton

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and so this one is ramie cotton

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.970 
and so this one is ramie cotton
polyester<00:02:15.999> and<00:02:16.239> spandex<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:17.109> you'll

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
polyester and spandex and you'll

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.550 
polyester and spandex and you'll
definitely<00:02:18.549> know<00:02:18.760> this<00:02:19.329> type<00:02:19.659> of<00:02:19.689> fabric<00:02:20.379> and

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
definitely know this type of fabric and

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.170 
definitely know this type of fabric and
the<00:02:20.859> difference<00:02:21.159> between<00:02:21.310> this<00:02:21.549> has<00:02:21.760> no<00:02:21.939> give

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
the difference between this has no give

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.569 
the difference between this has no give
when<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.480> pull<00:02:22.719> it<00:02:22.870> this<00:02:23.469> obviously<00:02:24.010> does<00:02:24.310> and

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:24.579 
when you pull it this obviously does and

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.280 
when you pull it this obviously does and
these<00:02:24.700> are<00:02:24.819> going<00:02:24.909> to<00:02:24.969> be<00:02:25.090> softer<00:02:25.629> and<00:02:25.930> more

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
these are going to be softer and more

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.349 
these are going to be softer and more
comfortable<00:02:26.760> from<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.939> get-go

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:28.359 
comfortable from the get-go

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:30.709 
comfortable from the get-go
and<00:02:28.659> will<00:02:29.079> pretty<00:02:29.349> much<00:02:29.530> remain<00:02:29.889> that<00:02:30.099> way

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:30.719 
and will pretty much remain that way

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.599 
and will pretty much remain that way
through<00:02:31.719> your<00:02:31.870> washings<00:02:32.319> but<00:02:32.829> those<00:02:33.250> are<00:02:33.430> some

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:33.609 
through your washings but those are some

00:02:33.609 --> 00:02:37.319 
through your washings but those are some
techniques<00:02:33.969> to<00:02:34.120> soften<00:02:34.780> your<00:02:34.930> new<00:02:35.049> jeans
