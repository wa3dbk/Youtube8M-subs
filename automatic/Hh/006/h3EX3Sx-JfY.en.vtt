00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910

and unfortunately I can't reply to
everyone<00:00:44.690> so<00:00:45.690> I'm<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.140> going<00:00:46.320> to<00:00:46.410> tell<00:00:46.559> you

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
everyone so I'm just going to tell you

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.639 
everyone so I'm just going to tell you
when<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.700> goes<00:00:47.879> left<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.719> set<00:00:49.020> X<00:00:49.260> scale<00:00:49.500> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
when you goes left you set X scale to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.340 
when you goes left you set X scale to
negative<00:00:50.010> 1<00:00:50.190> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.789> start<00:00:51.030> moving

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
negative 1 and then you start moving

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.010 
negative 1 and then you start moving
when<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.440> goes<00:00:52.559> right<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.309> set<00:00:53.660> image<00:00:54.660> xscale

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
when it goes right you set image xscale

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.010 
when it goes right you set image xscale
to<00:00:55.379> one<00:00:55.649> and<00:00:55.890> then<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.730> also<00:00:56.969> start<00:00:57.420> moving<00:00:57.840> in

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
to one and then you also start moving in

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.639 
to one and then you also start moving in
a<00:00:58.649> positive<00:00:58.920> x<00:00:59.370> direction<00:00:59.879> now<00:01:00.750> this<00:01:01.590> should

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
a positive x direction now this should

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.630 
a positive x direction now this should
all<00:01:02.160> work<00:01:02.460> but<00:01:03.449> what's<00:01:04.140> happening<00:01:04.559> is<00:01:04.710> the

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
all work but what's happening is the

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.120 
all work but what's happening is the
center<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.360> image<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.590> top<00:01:07.830> left

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
center of the image is in the top left

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.789 
center of the image is in the top left
corner<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.119> when<00:01:09.360> you<00:01:09.540> flip<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.229> image<00:01:10.350> it

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
corner so when you flip the image it

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.830 
corner so when you flip the image it
ends<00:01:11.430> up<00:01:11.549> taking<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:12.119> pasting<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.659> whole

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
ends up taking and pasting the whole

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.469 
ends up taking and pasting the whole
thing<00:01:13.080> right<00:01:13.500> over<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.400> now<00:01:15.150> we<00:01:15.360> don't

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
thing right over like that now we don't

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:17.870 
thing right over like that now we don't
want<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> so<00:01:16.680> if<00:01:16.799> you<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.100> click<00:01:17.310> center

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880

we're<00:02:19.840> going<00:02:19.959> to<00:02:20.019> say<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.379> variable<00:02:21.099> mo<00:02:21.970> is

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
we're going to say if variable mo is

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.910 
we're going to say if variable mo is
larger<00:02:24.459> than<00:02:24.790> zero<00:02:25.379> we're<00:02:26.379> going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.620> set

em oh so pretty much those are the two
two<00:03:57.099> main<00:03:57.699> problems<00:03:58.000> people<00:03:58.359> come<00:03:58.599> up<00:03:58.780> with

00:03:58.949 --> 00:03:58.959 
two main problems people come up with

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.170 
two main problems people come up with
center<00:03:59.859> the<00:03:59.979> image<00:04:00.250> then<00:04:00.519> you<00:04:00.609> won't<00:04:00.760> jump<00:04:01.060> a

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:02.590 
block every time you change direction

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.800

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:11.939 
variables as 0 that's a big one I often
will<00:04:10.810> make<00:04:10.959> a<00:04:10.989> game<00:04:11.290> and<00:04:11.470> then<00:04:11.590> i'll<00:04:11.680> create<00:04:11.829> a

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
will make a game and then i'll create a

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:14.819 
will make a game and then i'll create a
variable<00:04:12.280> and<00:04:12.609> i'll<00:04:12.699> do<00:04:12.849> a<00:04:12.879> check<00:04:13.269> before<00:04:14.169> I've

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
variable and i'll do a check before I've

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.360 
variable and i'll do a check before I've
ever<00:04:15.099> initialized<00:04:15.760> it<00:04:15.970> and<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:17.560> just<00:04:17.949> nicely

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
ever initialized it and this just nicely

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.800 
ever initialized it and this just nicely
helps<00:04:19.000> you<00:04:19.150> and<00:04:19.329> says<00:04:19.570> it's<00:04:19.840> 0<00:04:20.340> so<00:04:21.340> I<00:04:21.639> hope<00:04:22.539> this

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:22.810 
helps you and says it's 0 so I hope this

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.040
