down<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.660> motor<00:00:37.070> for<00:00:38.070> it<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.190> even<00:00:38.280> be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
down the motor for it to even be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.020 
down the motor for it to even be
somewhat<00:00:38.910> controllable<00:00:39.510> that<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.840> uh<00:00:39.870> I<00:00:41.030> was

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
actually only about eighty percent of

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.150 
actually only about eighty percent of
where<00:00:44.670> the<00:00:44.760> motor<00:00:45.000> can<00:00:45.270> do<00:00:45.600> I<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.739> ramped

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
where the motor can do I have it ramped
