okay<00:00:01.860> in<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.040> video<00:00:02.250> I'm<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.639> show<00:00:02.760> you

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
okay in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay in this video I'm going to show you
how<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.000> installed<00:00:03.389> the<00:00:03.480> drive<00:00:03.750> wheels<00:00:04.049> the

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
how I installed the drive wheels the

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.440 
how I installed the drive wheels the
first<00:00:05.190> thing<00:00:05.339> I<00:00:05.400> need<00:00:05.549> to<00:00:05.640> do<00:00:05.790> is<00:00:05.940> Mark<00:00:06.210> out<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
first thing I need to do is Mark out the

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.629 
first thing I need to do is Mark out the
position<00:00:07.170> of<00:00:07.410> the<00:00:07.649> tube<00:00:08.069> that's<00:00:08.370> going<00:00:08.460> to

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
position of the tube that's going to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.820 
position of the tube that's going to
hold<00:00:08.990> the<00:00:09.990> wheel<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:11.599> bearing<00:00:12.599> assembly

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:12.830 
hold the wheel and the bearing assembly

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.099 
hold the wheel and the bearing assembly
so<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:13.860> mark<00:00:14.130> that<00:00:14.190> out<00:00:14.340> on<00:00:14.759> both<00:00:15.299> sides<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.929> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
so I mark that out on both sides of the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.910 
so I mark that out on both sides of the
square<00:00:16.590> tubing<00:00:16.949> now<00:00:17.430> on<00:00:17.580> this<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:18.680> didn't<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.800> it

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
square tubing now on this I didn't do it

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.650 
square tubing now on this I didn't do it
like<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.250> other<00:00:20.400> one<00:00:20.580> because<00:00:20.910> I<00:00:20.939> have<00:00:21.359> to

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
like the other one because I have to

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.349 
like the other one because I have to
have<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:22.140> way<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:23.010> drive<00:00:23.250> shaft<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.970> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
have a way to get the drive shaft to the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.120 
have a way to get the drive shaft to the
wheel<00:00:24.539> so<00:00:25.439> I<00:00:25.470> have<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> hollow<00:00:27.240> tube

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
wheel so I have to have a hollow tube

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.150 
wheel so I have to have a hollow tube
that<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.580> bearing<00:00:30.330> assembly<00:00:30.449> mounts<00:00:31.109> to<00:00:31.289> so

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
that the bearing assembly mounts to so

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.740 
that the bearing assembly mounts to so
what<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> do<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:32.759> cut<00:00:32.940> this<00:00:33.090> out<00:00:33.270> using<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
what I do is I cut this out using a

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.880 
what I do is I cut this out using a
grinder<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:36.020> this<00:00:37.020> is<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> square<00:00:37.469> stock

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
grinder and this is the square stock

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:39.380 
grinder and this is the square stock
this<00:00:38.100> is<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:38.309> same<00:00:38.520> as<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.760> used<00:00:38.790> on<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.210> front

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
this is the same as I used on the front

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.350 
this is the same as I used on the front
on<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:40.260> tension<00:00:40.829> wheels<00:00:41.010> but<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.030> difference

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
on the tension wheels but the difference

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.930 
on the tension wheels but the difference
is<00:00:42.540> this<00:00:42.870> one's<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> go<00:00:43.350> through<00:00:43.940> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
is this one's going to go through so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.240 
is this one's going to go through so
that<00:00:44.969> I<00:00:45.120> can<00:00:45.360> run<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> drive<00:00:45.870> through<00:00:46.250> through

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
that I can run the drive through through

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.270 
that I can run the drive through through
this<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.480> wheel<00:00:48.690> to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.920> bearing

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
this to the wheel to the bearing

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.939 
this to the wheel to the bearing
assembly<00:00:50.780> so<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.079> is<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.440> tacked<00:00:52.680> it<00:00:52.829> in

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
assembly so here it is I tacked it in

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.790 
assembly so here it is I tacked it in
place<00:00:53.219> got<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.239> lined<00:00:54.449> up<00:00:54.690> both<00:00:55.230> are<00:00:55.410> lined<00:00:55.620> up

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
place got it lined up both are lined up

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.000 
place got it lined up both are lined up
and<00:00:56.390> as<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.539> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.989> can<00:00:58.140> see<00:00:58.379> directly

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
and as you can see you can see directly

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.000 
and as you can see you can see directly
through<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> and<00:01:00.260> I'm<00:01:01.260> mounting<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> same

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
through it and I'm mounting it the same

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.160 
through it and I'm mounting it the same
way<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.190> did<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.210> tension<00:01:03.690> wheels<00:01:03.870> I'm

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
way I did on the tension wheels I'm

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.700 
way I did on the tension wheels I'm
using<00:01:05.390> all<00:01:06.390> these<00:01:06.540> I'm<00:01:06.750> using<00:01:06.930> carriage<00:01:07.350> bolts

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
using all these I'm using carriage bolts

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.700 
using all these I'm using carriage bolts
but<00:01:08.520> allows<00:01:09.030> me<00:01:09.299> to<00:01:09.570> get<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.020> angle<00:01:10.380> exactly

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
but allows me to get the angle exactly

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.109 
but allows me to get the angle exactly
right<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.840> position<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> so<00:01:13.790> that<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.880> track

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
right and position it so that the track

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.350 
right and position it so that the track
will<00:01:15.390> track<00:01:16.170> straight

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.420 

okay<00:01:21.050> the<00:01:21.260> next<00:01:21.440> thing<00:01:21.620> I<00:01:21.770> have<00:01:21.860> to<00:01:22.040> do<00:01:22.190> is

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:22.430 
okay the next thing I have to do is

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.540 
okay the next thing I have to do is
figure<00:01:22.970> out<00:01:23.120> how<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.920> attach<00:01:24.920> the<00:01:25.130> driveshaft

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
figure out how to attach the driveshaft

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.350 
figure out how to attach the driveshaft
to<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.980> bearing<00:01:27.980> assembly<00:01:28.070> as<00:01:28.910> you<00:01:29.030> can<00:01:29.180> see

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
to the bearing assembly as you can see

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.060 
to the bearing assembly as you can see
inside<00:01:29.720> here<00:01:30.110> there's<00:01:30.800> a<00:01:31.930> nut<00:01:32.930> that's<00:01:33.680> on<00:01:33.950> the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
inside here there's a nut that's on the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.340 
inside here there's a nut that's on the
end<00:01:34.220> but<00:01:34.460> it's<00:01:34.640> clamped<00:01:34.940> in<00:01:35.240> place<00:01:35.270> so<00:01:36.230> it

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
end but it's clamped in place so it

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.460 
end but it's clamped in place so it
can't<00:01:36.650> come<00:01:36.860> apart<00:01:37.190> so<00:01:37.460> I'm<00:01:38.030> going<00:01:38.360> to<00:01:38.470> devise

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
can't come apart so I'm going to devise

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.010 
can't come apart so I'm going to devise
a<00:01:39.500> way<00:01:39.710> to<00:01:39.860> connect<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.880> driveshaft<00:01:41.120> to<00:01:41.750> this

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
a way to connect the driveshaft to this

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.130 
a way to connect the driveshaft to this
and<00:01:42.640> this<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:43.700> what's<00:01:44.090> going<00:01:44.270> to<00:01:44.360> spend<00:01:44.750> the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
and this is what's going to spend the

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.810 
and this is what's going to spend the
the<00:01:46.010> drive<00:01:46.280> wheels<00:01:48.100> now<00:01:49.100> on<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:49.340> other<00:01:49.490> side

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
the drive wheels now on the other side

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.680 
the drive wheels now on the other side
of<00:01:50.030> this<00:01:50.210> I'm<00:01:50.570> going<00:01:51.050> to<00:01:51.110> mount<00:01:51.350> a<00:01:51.470> bearing

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:52.690 
of this I'm going to mount a bearing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.740 
of this I'm going to mount a bearing
holder<00:01:53.690> that<00:01:54.200> will<00:01:54.940> that<00:01:55.940> the<00:01:56.090> other<00:01:56.300> side<00:01:56.600> of

driveshaft in place okay these are the
tension<00:02:10.490> wheels<00:02:10.670> I'm<00:02:10.880> going<00:02:11.000> to<00:02:11.060> use<00:02:11.180> for<00:02:11.510> the

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
tension wheels I'm going to use for the

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.870 
tension wheels I'm going to use for the
track<00:02:12.470> I've<00:02:12.910> installed<00:02:13.910> them<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.760> just<00:02:16.760> use

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
track I've installed them and just use

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.060 
track I've installed them and just use
some<00:02:17.060> smaller<00:02:17.330> wheels<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:18.470> same<00:02:18.680> width<00:02:18.890> as

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
some smaller wheels the same width as

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:20.620 
some smaller wheels the same width as
the<00:02:19.100> wheels<00:02:19.370> on<00:02:19.550> the<00:02:19.640> bottom<00:02:19.820> but<00:02:20.300> smaller

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
the wheels on the bottom but smaller

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.090 
the wheels on the bottom but smaller
diameter<00:02:21.410> wheels<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.870> my<00:02:23.870> idea<00:02:24.260> with<00:02:24.500> this<00:02:24.860> is

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
diameter wheels and my idea with this is

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:30.610 
diameter wheels and my idea with this is
to<00:02:25.610> use<00:02:25.880> a<00:02:28.060> shock<00:02:29.060> type<00:02:29.600> absorber<00:02:30.470> it's

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
to use a shock type absorber it's

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.900 
to use a shock type absorber it's
actually<00:02:30.950> like<00:02:31.040> a<00:02:31.070> piston<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.580> you<00:02:31.790> would

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
actually like a piston that you would

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:33.850 
actually like a piston that you would
use<00:02:32.060> on<00:02:32.090> your<00:02:32.420> hatchback<00:02:33.230> of<00:02:33.260> your<00:02:33.530> car<00:02:33.709> or

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
use on your hatchback of your car or

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420 
use on your hatchback of your car or
something<00:02:34.220> but<00:02:35.260> my<00:02:36.260> idea<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.650> to<00:02:36.709> install<00:02:37.190> that

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
something but my idea is to install that

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.550 
something but my idea is to install that
and<00:02:38.860> use<00:02:39.860> that<00:02:40.250> to<00:02:40.489> keep<00:02:40.700> tension<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.320> on

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
and use that to keep tension on the on

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.600 
and use that to keep tension on the on
the<00:02:43.489> track<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.650> what<00:02:45.650> will<00:02:45.769> happen<00:02:46.190> is<00:02:46.340> these

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
the track so what will happen is these

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.180 
the track so what will happen is these
will<00:02:46.910> be<00:02:47.060> compressed<00:02:47.660> these<00:02:48.500> Pistons<00:02:48.980> will<00:02:49.100> be

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
will be compressed these Pistons will be

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.710 
will be compressed these Pistons will be
compressed<00:02:49.550> so<00:02:49.670> it'll<00:02:49.850> it'll<00:02:50.209> keep<00:02:50.390> tension

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
compressed so it'll it'll keep tension

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.020 
compressed so it'll it'll keep tension
up<00:02:51.019> on<00:02:51.200> the<00:02:51.350> on<00:02:51.590> the<00:02:52.300> on<00:02:53.300> these<00:02:53.540> wheels<00:02:53.810> here

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
up on the on the on these wheels here

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.090 
up on the on the on these wheels here
okay<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.090> this<00:02:56.330> is<00:02:56.510> how<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.630> plan<00:02:56.959> on<00:02:57.100> driving

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
okay so this is how I plan on driving

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.340 
okay so this is how I plan on driving
the<00:02:58.280> tracks<00:02:58.580> with<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.540> drive<00:02:59.870> wheels<00:03:00.140> I'm

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:00.350 
the tracks with the drive wheels I'm

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:04.090 
the tracks with the drive wheels I'm
going<00:03:00.560> to<00:03:00.620> use<00:03:00.769> these<00:03:01.120> one<00:03:02.120> inch<00:03:02.410> flat<00:03:03.410> bar<00:03:03.739> I'm

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
going to use these one inch flat bar I'm

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.590 
going to use these one inch flat bar I'm
going<00:03:04.280> to<00:03:04.340> weld<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.640> between<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.060> rim<00:03:05.269> here

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
going to weld it between the rim here

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.479 
going to weld it between the rim here
and<00:03:05.780> they're<00:03:06.560> going<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.739> be<00:03:06.830> spaced<00:03:07.220> evenly

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
and they're going to be spaced evenly

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.500 
and they're going to be spaced evenly
around<00:03:08.000> the<00:03:08.150> rim<00:03:09.040> so<00:03:10.040> that<00:03:10.310> two<00:03:10.730> of<00:03:10.760> the<00:03:11.180> tracks

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:11.510 
around the rim so that two of the tracks

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.050 
around the rim so that two of the tracks
will<00:03:11.840> fit<00:03:12.050> in<00:03:12.260> between<00:03:12.620> each<00:03:12.769> each<00:03:13.160> one<00:03:13.940> of

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
will fit in between each each one of

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.470 
will fit in between each each one of
these<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:14.540> then<00:03:15.230> it<00:03:15.500> will<00:03:15.680> actually<00:03:16.330> come<00:03:17.330> up

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
these and then it will actually come up

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.300 
these and then it will actually come up
between<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:18.260> tracks<00:03:18.590> the<00:03:18.890> tracks<00:03:19.130> are<00:03:19.250> going

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
between the tracks the tracks are going

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.539 
between the tracks the tracks are going
to<00:03:19.430> be<00:03:19.489> secured<00:03:19.910> on<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> metal<00:03:20.630> cable<00:03:21.080> and<00:03:21.549> so

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:22.549 
to be secured on a metal cable and so

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.280 
to be secured on a metal cable and so
they<00:03:22.670> can't<00:03:22.910> move<00:03:23.120> and<00:03:23.450> then<00:03:24.049> these<00:03:24.230> are

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
they can't move and then these are

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.910 
they can't move and then these are
actually<00:03:24.769> going<00:03:24.860> to<00:03:24.950> drive<00:03:25.400> the<00:03:25.760> tracks<00:03:26.920> so

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
actually going to drive the tracks so

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.500 
actually going to drive the tracks so
this<00:03:28.070> is<00:03:28.220> my<00:03:28.340> plan<00:03:28.610> I<00:03:28.640> hope<00:03:28.940> it<00:03:29.090> works

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
this is my plan I hope it works

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.699 
this is my plan I hope it works
now<00:03:29.959> we'll<00:03:30.709> see

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
now we'll see

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.729 
now we'll see
okay<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:32.280> couldn't<00:03:32.489> resist<00:03:32.670> I<00:03:33.030> had<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.739> try

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
okay I couldn't resist I had to try

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.369 
okay I couldn't resist I had to try
these<00:03:34.799> tracks<00:03:35.250> out<00:03:35.489> and<00:03:35.790> put<00:03:36.360> them<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.599> to<00:03:37.230> get

00:03:37.369 --> 00:03:37.379 
these tracks out and put them on to get

00:03:37.379 --> 00:03:39.440 
these tracks out and put them on to get
an<00:03:37.500> idea<00:03:37.829> what<00:03:38.010> it<00:03:38.099> looks<00:03:38.280> like<00:03:38.519> they're<00:03:39.299> not

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
an idea what it looks like they're not

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.690 
an idea what it looks like they're not
nearly<00:03:39.840> done<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.500> have<00:03:40.769> just<00:03:41.040> enough<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.549> do

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
nearly done I have just enough to do

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.319 
nearly done I have just enough to do
almost<00:03:42.299> one<00:03:42.659> and<00:03:43.849> anyway<00:03:44.849> I<00:03:44.879> wanted<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.209> see

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
almost one and anyway I wanted to see

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:46.640 
almost one and anyway I wanted to see
what<00:03:45.450> it<00:03:45.510> looked<00:03:45.659> like<00:03:45.689> so<00:03:46.049> this<00:03:46.319> is<00:03:46.470> your

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
what it looked like so this is your

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.069 
what it looked like so this is your
sneak<00:03:47.370> peek<00:03:47.640> I'm<00:03:48.299> going<00:03:48.540> to<00:03:48.599> have<00:03:48.689> a<00:03:48.750> really

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:49.079 
sneak peek I'm going to have a really

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:51.710 
sneak peek I'm going to have a really
