00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.380
 hello then I will introduce you the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.639
 bike trial streaks with which the 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.740
 people ride this year m it's a 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.590
 nice bird that gives them a very 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.910
 short very sturdy very handy which he 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.740
 has been reinforced at certain points in 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.900
 level of the steering column at 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.160
 level of the case we will find a 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.750
 chain tension system that were 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.070
 improved in order to be ever more 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.980
 effective in terms of odds 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.720
 the total wheelbase is 1 m the beauty 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.000
 crankset was still lowered so 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.800
 to always be more stable for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.780
 crossings then the textbooks or the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.500
 figures the bases have been shortened 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 still a little bit 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.300
 always in the same perspective finally the 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.270
 two gained in nervousness and in rotation 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.100
 fast and the cockpit then this 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.140
 which is the stem or handlebar it's 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.399
 bronze gallows and relatively raised 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.780
 but the handlebars very wide and stable at 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.379
 braking level we will find some 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.320
 magura mt 6 with the particularity of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.210
 large rotor diameter 203 mm in 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.809
 benefit from maximum blows 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.710
 wheel level 

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:11.530
 it's planet x wheels in 24 inches 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.810
 thirty two double-walled holes in order to 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.030
 perfectly resist the shock the hubs 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:18.880
 these are currently always offers 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.770
 to the bust s and I have not found better the 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.140
 tires so that comes from the cycle besides 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.360
 Direct are the last 24 motorcycles 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.070
 trains had forced gray gide so 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.149
 yes some fears some tricks there 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.829
 it's true that for street bikes 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.840
 have done a lot of rotations in fact 

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.920
 yes we were starting to see the arrival of 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.750
 pine bars 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.340
 we can see a little trick at the level 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.810
 of the brake hose to be done in order to 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.539
 make a maximum of turns with the button 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.959
 the hose it goes into the column of 

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:42.340
 direction 

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:44.770
 there we can do what a dirty atmosphere 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.270
 still a little trick we will find 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.310
 at the bottom of the pedal a joint in 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.289
 rubber that will allow to block 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.549
 the cranks in rotations the 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.849
 pedals always stays flat 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:57.220
 allows you to find last easily 

00:01:54.849 --> 00:02:00.459
 for the transmission we will find a 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.520
 truvativ crankset with braque and 

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.720
 22 in front and 16 behind that allows you to 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.399
 take a little more speed than on 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.869
 reports have found a tradition 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.310
 now on the back the trial if you 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.560
 want more information and images 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.700
 discipline go to twitter.com 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.700
 hello see you soon
