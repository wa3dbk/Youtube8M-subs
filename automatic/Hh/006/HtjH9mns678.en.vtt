but on the threw together two guys and

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.490 
but on the threw together two guys and
the<00:03:00.970> crowd<00:03:01.209> just<00:03:01.360> loved<00:03:01.630> it<00:03:01.840> and<00:03:01.959> they<00:03:02.319> just

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
the crowd just loved it and they just

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.080 
the crowd just loved it and they just
brought<00:03:02.709> went<00:03:03.040> with<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.310> gave<00:03:03.610> him<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.790> belts

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
brought went with it gave him the belts

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:05.670 
brought went with it gave him the belts
and<00:03:04.269> a<00:03:04.390> way<00:03:04.510> they<00:03:04.690> went<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.200> think<00:03:05.500> it's<00:03:05.620> a

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 
and a way they went so I think it's a

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.800 
and a way they went so I think it's a
similar<00:03:05.950> situation<00:03:06.360> unfortunately<00:03:07.360> for<00:03:07.750> the

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
similar situation unfortunately for the

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.960 
similar situation unfortunately for the
users<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.319> the<00:03:08.440> prime<00:03:08.620> time<00:03:08.799> players<00:03:08.970> maybe

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
users and the prime time players maybe

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.780 
users and the prime time players maybe
the<00:03:10.150> real<00:03:10.299> Americans<00:03:10.780> it<00:03:11.560> means<00:03:11.859> that<00:03:12.100> that's

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 
the real Americans it means that that's

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.340 
the real Americans it means that that's
a<00:03:13.000> it's<00:03:13.299> at<00:03:13.450> their<00:03:13.630> expense

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
a it's at their expense

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:16.680 
a it's at their expense
so<00:03:14.880> probably<00:03:15.880> actually<00:03:16.180> a<00:03:16.209> better<00:03:16.329> thing<00:03:16.540> for

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
so probably actually a better thing for

and go that I think he could be a main
event<00:04:02.829> babyface<00:04:03.340> and<00:04:03.639> you<00:04:03.880> know<00:04:03.970> he<00:04:04.150> could<00:04:04.299> be

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
event babyface and you know he could be

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.410 
event babyface and you know he could be
really<00:04:05.500> really<00:04:05.889> special<00:04:06.730> I<00:04:07.060> think<00:04:07.299> Roman

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
really really special I think Roman

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.199 
really really special I think Roman
reigns<00:04:07.540> he's<00:04:07.930> got<00:04:08.139> a<00:04:08.170> Dean<00:04:08.950> Ambrose<00:04:09.430> fantastic

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
reigns he's got a Dean Ambrose fantastic

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.150 
reigns he's got a Dean Ambrose fantastic
he'll<00:04:10.420> and<00:04:10.660> Seth<00:04:11.350> Rollins<00:04:11.530> as<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:11.920> know<00:04:12.040> as

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.160 
he'll and Seth Rollins as you know as

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.970 
he'll and Seth Rollins as you know as
you<00:04:12.190> Jeff<00:04:13.120> Hardy<00:04:13.480> have<00:04:13.750> even<00:04:14.080> seen<00:04:14.530> him<00:04:14.650> Punk's

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
you Jeff Hardy have even seen him Punk's

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.080 
you Jeff Hardy have even seen him Punk's
sorta<00:04:15.310> type<00:04:16.080> guy<00:04:17.080> so<00:04:17.500> I<00:04:17.530> think<00:04:17.849> the<00:04:18.849> shield

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
sorta type guy so I think the shield

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.810 
sorta type guy so I think the shield
will<00:04:19.330> be<00:04:19.450> fine

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
will be fine

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.900 
will be fine
if<00:04:19.910> they<00:04:20.060> break<00:04:20.270> up<00:04:20.920> so<00:04:21.920> I'm<00:04:22.160> giving<00:04:22.490> them<00:04:22.550> I

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:22.910 
if they break up so I'm giving them I

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.120 
if they break up so I'm giving them I
think<00:04:23.780> they<00:04:23.990> actually<00:04:24.110> the<00:04:24.590> Rose<00:04:24.770> brothers

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
think they actually the Rose brothers

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.620 
think they actually the Rose brothers
went<00:04:25.280> with<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.430> perfect<00:04:25.790> tag<00:04:26.000> team<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.360> take<00:04:26.510> the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
went with a perfect tag team to take the

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:27.820 
went with a perfect tag team to take the
bells<00:04:26.780> from<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:26.990> show<00:04:27.140> think<00:04:27.410> you<00:04:27.560> had<00:04:27.740> to

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
bells from the show think you had to

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.320 
bells from the show think you had to
have<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:27.980> tag<00:04:28.220> team<00:04:28.430> that<00:04:28.610> was<00:04:28.730> kind<00:04:28.940> of<00:04:29.000> really

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:29.330 
have a tag team that was kind of really

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.180 
have a tag team that was kind of really
established<00:04:29.900> crowd<00:04:30.590> was<00:04:30.740> definitely<00:04:31.100> behind

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:31.190 
established crowd was definitely behind

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.090 
established crowd was definitely behind
and<00:04:32.650> could<00:04:33.650> easily<00:04:33.980> be<00:04:34.250> considered<00:04:35.200> a<00:04:36.200> permit

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:37.100 
and could easily be considered a permit

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.780 
and could easily be considered a permit
card<00:04:37.370> even<00:04:37.970> perhaps<00:04:38.390> main<00:04:38.750> event<00:04:39.050> guys<00:04:39.610> so<00:04:40.610> I'm

card even perhaps main event guys so I'm

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.010 
card even perhaps main event guys so I'm
gonna<00:04:40.880> take<00:04:41.060> the<00:04:41.210> bells<00:04:41.390> for<00:04:41.540> the<00:04:41.630> shield<00:04:41.870> you

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
gonna take the bells for the shield you

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.390 
gonna take the bells for the shield you
couldn't<00:04:42.320> have<00:04:42.440> public<00:04:42.800> that<00:04:42.920> who<00:04:43.010> serves<00:04:43.310> the

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
couldn't have public that who serves the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.070 
couldn't have public that who serves the
prawn<00:04:43.640> suppliers<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.180> just<00:04:44.390> you<00:04:44.690> just<00:04:44.870> wouldn't

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
prawn suppliers I just you just wouldn't

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.720 
prawn suppliers I just you just wouldn't
believe<00:04:45.200> it

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
believe it

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.700 
believe it
but<00:04:46.730> I<00:04:47.150> think<00:04:47.720> that<00:04:47.870> the<00:04:48.050> right<00:04:48.170> decision<00:04:48.590> was

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
but I think that the right decision was

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.230 
but I think that the right decision was
made<00:04:48.950> to<00:04:49.010> give<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.460> bell<00:04:49.610> to<00:04:49.790> sue<00:04:49.910> the<00:04:50.060> roads

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
made to give the bell to sue the roads

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:52.450 
made to give the bell to sue the roads
the<00:04:51.080> rods<00:04:51.290> rollers<00:04:51.680> because<00:04:52.100> then<00:04:52.250> you<00:04:52.340> could

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
the rods rollers because then you could

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.280 
the rods rollers because then you could
have<00:04:52.520> a<00:04:52.610> credible<00:04:53.000> tag<00:04:53.210> team<00:04:53.480> some<00:04:53.810> to<00:04:53.960> really

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:01.700 
think this had seen division I mean the

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.600 
think this had seen division I mean the
tact<00:06:01.910> in<00:06:02.060> divisions<00:06:02.420> main<00:06:02.570> eventing<00:06:03.080> raw<00:06:03.770> so

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
tact in divisions main eventing raw so
