00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:04.350
 cause heavy rain or even 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.259
 make a flood right on the theater stage 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.179
 now possible and this show in the rain 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 originally from St. Petersburg but immediately conquered 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.469
 metropolitan public with their experiments 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.559
 as evidence in the hall there is no free 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.559
 places 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.490
 viewers wonder where 

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.750
 water is taken on stage and where it goes 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.369
 director rustam nadyrshin certainly not 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.470
 wants to reveal all the secrets but 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.420
 some still had to share 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.430
 order special or new 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.190
 central there are 40 thousand euros for it 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:41.290
 spent then installed rain system 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.379
 then the problem is not only to even 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.680
 but the water has arrived on our top yet 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:49.930
 the problem is that somehow clean up and 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.480
 so in there with the help of all sorts of pumps and 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.489
 other systems and some water is cleaned 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.530
 everything that happens on stage looks like 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.090
 very original and many are not attracted 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.960
 as much acting as 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.960
 impressive effects 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.399
 artists admit that in the rain 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:36.320
 dance very hard to cold water 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.579
 they are accustomed to but from accidents 

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.700
 cases on wet floor 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.070
 no one insured injury happens 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.810
 it is impossible not to avoid them therefore there 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.780
 suburban is heavier i.e. need 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.340
 feel more balance probably 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.500
 the scene is more hold then there is more 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.719
 clutch with the scene has scary to do 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 some jumps but for the sake of the audience we 

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:57.530
 ready for all the actors splash in the water 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.960
 perform complex acrobatics 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.000
 jump and run through the puddles but the audience in 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.459
 the first row remain dry until the end 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.380
 submission this special enough 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:07.539
 such complex equipment which 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.340
 necessarily 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:12.079
 the pool fits the scene where not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:15.440
 a single drop falls 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:17.660
 how with this on the floor of the stage is wooden so 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.489
 and got up but no complicated technology 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 will make on girls such an impression 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.569
 like a dozen naked wet men 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.640
 tel therefore and the vast majority 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:28.340
 the audience is representative 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.099
 the fair sex really liked you 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.750
 for the second time I â€™ve been told pretty 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.459
 yes you 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:38.510
 let's go the third time don't give you water 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:39.859
 the first round of the tournament i'm just moving 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.079
 most like all the same 

00:02:39.859 --> 00:02:42.910
 amazing special effects or nudes 

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.470
 male bodies 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.170
 probably without special effects but also body 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.329
 Of course, how can it be without this director? 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.040
 ready for a new solution assure if 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:53.510
 managed the rain now they can 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.670
 decorate any element 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.560
 the only thing that still holds appliances 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.299
 does not always keep up with creative thought 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.739
 on and most sites are bad 

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.079
 adapted to so brave 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:06.310
 experiments Maria Novikova Oleg 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:06.310
