00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
exhaust it is about that big all the way

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.790 
exhaust it is about that big all the way
to<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.820> engine<00:01:56.120> of<00:01:56.240> the<00:01:56.300> car<00:01:56.330> it<00:01:57.230> just<00:01:57.440> flows

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:57.800 
to the engine of the car it just flows

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.710 
to the engine of the car it just flows
right<00:01:58.100> through<00:01:58.340> and<00:01:58.820> you're<00:01:59.390> going<00:01:59.480> to<00:01:59.540> hear

00:01:59.710 --> 00:01:59.720 
right through and you're going to hear

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.270 
right through and you're going to hear
big<00:02:00.050> sound<00:02:00.350> difference<00:02:00.710> between<00:02:01.010> this<00:02:01.220> and

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
big sound difference between this and

that go ahead and fire up Kyle notice

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:08.440 
that go ahead and fire up Kyle notice
it's<00:02:07.160> a<00:02:07.220> little<00:02:07.460> higher<00:02:07.610> pitch<00:02:07.910> because<00:02:08.300> it's

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
it's a little higher pitch because it's

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.510 
it's a little higher pitch because it's
a<00:02:08.510> four<00:02:08.720> cylinder<00:02:08.929> as<00:02:09.590> opposed<00:02:10.070> to<00:02:10.250> the<00:02:10.340> big

a four cylinder as opposed to the big
block<00:02:10.670> v8<00:02:11.260> now<00:02:12.260> if<00:02:12.410> he<00:02:12.530> wraps<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.860> up<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.100> little

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
block v8 now if he wraps it up a little

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.940 
block v8 now if he wraps it up a little
bit<00:02:16.270> notice<00:02:17.270> thing<00:02:17.590> notice<00:02:18.590> how<00:02:18.710> you<00:02:18.770> hear

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:18.950 
bit notice thing notice how you hear

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:21.040 
bit notice thing notice how you hear
some<00:02:19.160> gurgling<00:02:19.550> and<00:02:19.700> some<00:02:19.880> backfires<00:02:20.330> that's

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
some gurgling and some backfires that's

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.720 
some gurgling and some backfires that's
because<00:02:21.410> the<00:02:21.560> size<00:02:21.830> of<00:02:22.010> the<00:02:22.100> exhaust<00:02:22.340> just

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
because the size of the exhaust just

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.150 
because the size of the exhaust just
allows<00:02:23.000> a<00:02:23.030> lot<00:02:23.330> more<00:02:23.540> airflow<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:24.980> leave

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:25.160 
allows a lot more airflow you can leave

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:32.500 
allows a lot more airflow you can leave
it<00:02:25.190> running<00:02:25.370> cow<00:02:27.760> office<00:02:28.760> hood<00:02:28.970> for<00:02:29.210> us

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.690 

we'll<00:02:33.510> show<00:02:33.690> you<00:02:33.720> the<00:02:33.930> block<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.800> cool

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
we'll show you the block out the cool

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.690 
we'll show you the block out the cool
thing<00:02:35.880> about<00:02:35.910> a<00:02:36.150> turbocharged<00:02:36.900> car<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.920> it<00:02:38.280> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
thing about a turbocharged car is it the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.910 
thing about a turbocharged car is it the
turbo<00:02:39.060> works<00:02:39.300> by<00:02:39.870> pushing<00:02:40.170> pressure<00:02:40.560> and

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
turbo works by pushing pressure and

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.620 
turbo works by pushing pressure and
hearing<00:02:41.250> to<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.460> engine<00:02:41.760> which<00:02:41.970> allows<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.510> to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
hearing to the engine which allows it to

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.030 
hearing to the engine which allows it to
give<00:02:42.810> a<00:02:42.840> lot<00:02:43.020> more<00:02:43.230> power<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.620> horses<00:02:43.950> and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
give a lot more power and horses and

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.150 
give a lot more power and horses and
performance<00:02:44.670> so<00:02:45.500> when<00:02:46.500> that<00:02:46.620> turbo<00:02:46.950> is<00:02:47.010> done

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
performance so when that turbo is done

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.860 
performance so when that turbo is done
pushing<00:02:47.370> that<00:02:47.580> pressure<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:48.390> has<00:02:48.570> to<00:02:48.750> go

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
pushing that pressure it has to go

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.230 
pushing that pressure it has to go
somewhere<00:02:49.400> that's<00:02:50.400> when<00:02:50.580> you<00:02:50.610> get<00:02:50.760> a<00:02:50.820> trusty

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
somewhere that's when you get a trusty

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.510 
somewhere that's when you get a trusty
little<00:02:51.360> Bluff<00:02:51.660> out<00:02:51.900> like<00:02:52.140> this<00:02:52.350> and<00:02:52.650> you're

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
little Bluff out like this and you're

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.160 
little Bluff out like this and you're
going<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.700> see<00:02:53.880> what<00:02:53.910> it<00:02:54.150> does<00:02:54.300> step<00:02:54.960> back<00:02:55.110> a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
going to see what it does step back a
