00:00:01.679 --> 00:00:06.549
 hello i am ineke van de berg 

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:09.429
 I'm biophysical medicine ge 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.139
 founder and owner of mee cb 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.370
 a medical center for biophysical 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:13.809
 medicine 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:16.270
 biophysical medicine is one 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:17.590
 special task within medicine 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.630
 where medical use 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.820
 equipment where we really go looking 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.350
 to what is the cause 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.780
 behind the power with which people come 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.180
 people come to the right place at miss abbey 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:31.810
 have chronic complaints and illness from 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:34.390
 Lyme is so misunderstood and diagnosed 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:36.670
 is so hard to imagine that people 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.830
 Sometimes they don't know it at all 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.080
 we treat people who have it 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.030
 long-term chronic illness and seeing 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.400
 that more and more people have the disease 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.410
 and we have so much 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.900
 Experience gained we treat quite a lot 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.730
 many patients 200 to 20 per week 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.250
 patients per week involving a whole 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.800
 large population very large part 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:57.340
 of which those people have disease of 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:58.510
 lyme 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.329
 that does indicate how large the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.670
 problem is also because the so many 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:06.100
 people we now come together with illness from 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:09.130
 lyme problems that are so intense 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.630
 to delve deeper into this theme and 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.550
 we are three and a half years back 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.990
 scientific research 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.120
 what actually happens in it 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.460
 human body as people who have disease 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.370
 of lyme servants have borrelia 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.479
 bacterium enters the body whatever 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.549
 happens 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.950
 and that is something you have to understand in order to 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.990
 targeted treatment 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.540
 we have many patients who participate 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.520
 this research which means we have a lot of data 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.710
 have all data processed in it 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.560
 graphs that allow us to analyze 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.930
 that certain symptoms cause symptoms 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.119
 certain treatments always come back 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.280
 and we learned a lot from the past 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.710
 times meanwhile is scientific 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.049
 investigation completed and we are in it 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.510
 managed to be effective 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.299
 detection but also treatment methods 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.340
 develop with good protocols to the 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.770
 people with lyme disease 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.890
 can already be effective 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.829
 yes, after twenty years of experience we can 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.140
 we can really say we really see it 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.929
 that we have been able to have many people 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.670
 treat with good result 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.010
 we also see people again after a number 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.110
 years and we can do that too 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:19.440
 conclude that our treatment methods 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:22.110
 also good but really thorough is real 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.180
 have been busy with the cause behind it 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.400
 the forces time that specific person 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.540
 some lyme disease expresses itself at 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.549
 everyone is different again 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.380
 so it is also a very individual one 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.840
 approach 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.340
 against all those people who sit at home with 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.630
 lyme disease 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.970
 may not know they have the disease 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.880
 of lyme with that terrible 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.599
 complaints I want to say do not give up 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.170
 on 

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:48.290
 there is real hope and want to see you 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.290
 inform about it
