clubs<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.450> hope<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.170> never<00:01:52.320> have<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.590> deal<00:01:52.860> with

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
clubs I hope you never have to deal with

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.460 
clubs I hope you never have to deal with
these<00:01:53.070> kind<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.430> things<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:54.240> gives<00:01:54.450> the<00:01:55.229> player

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
these kind of things it gives the player

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.950 
these kind of things it gives the player
the<00:01:55.799> opportunity<00:01:56.400> to<00:01:56.520> be<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.670> manager<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.240> or

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
the opportunity to be a manager and or

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.200 
the opportunity to be a manager and or
what<00:01:58.140> goes<00:01:58.320> with<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.590> which<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.759> outside

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
what goes with it which on the outside

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.140 
what goes with it which on the outside
looks<00:02:01.080> a<00:02:01.200> simple<00:02:01.560> simple<00:02:02.310> job<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:02.790> obviously

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.150 
looks a simple simple job but obviously

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:04.670 
looks a simple simple job but obviously
when<00:02:03.509> you're<00:02:03.630> involved<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.020> it<00:02:04.200> it's<00:02:04.380> not<00:02:04.530> so

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
when you're involved in it it's not so

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.740 
when you're involved in it it's not so
simple<00:02:04.799> and<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.909> just<00:02:06.150> think<00:02:06.299> it<00:02:06.420> gives<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
simple and I just think it gives the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.359 
simple and I just think it gives the
player<00:02:06.960> an<00:02:07.110> insight<00:02:07.439> into<00:02:07.470> what<00:02:07.920> goes<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.250> in
