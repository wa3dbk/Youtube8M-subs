00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:14.019
 episode 1 the latest drying 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:17.560
 science part 2 ignition fat 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.770
 tissue catch so the body turns 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.980
 fat to energy and polis fat is 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.960
 strategic energy sources 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.710
 our distant ancestors suffered from 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.850
 malnutrition and so the body was forced 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:33.530
 hedge against the extra calories of this 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.430
 trouble fat tissues fortunately science 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.760
 capable of deceiving evolution we decided 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.530
 stables 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.710
 manat vs one of the most effective 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.280
 ways to fight fatty tissue 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.270
 surprised aerobic load such 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.870
 the floor itself for maximum 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 effect their worth doing in 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.460
 certain time dents class stomped 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.030
 for example the accordion must be performed 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.810
 in the early morning when the body is due 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:01.640
 lack of other energy sources 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.760
 he is forced to spend fat 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.050
 stocks had time 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:07.270
 Moscow at this time the level of glycogen 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.070
 glucose and and insulin is minimal 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.900
 and it also contributes 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.020
 active fatty depletion 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.320
 cells but 300 LVL precisely for this 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.170
 the reason many professional 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.870
 Tourists prefer to do Scartel 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:24.050
 early morning AvtoVAZ 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:26.820
 forster wheel scientists 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.010
 How can we increase the effect of refusing 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.200
 workouts 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.640
 interiors and receiver of special substances 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.510
 able to multiply the return on 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:37.130
 aerobic exercise 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.619
 in billboard 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.230
 shipyard project 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.820
 their task is not to start a policy 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.670
 the contract involves raising the level 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550
 main fat burning 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.300
 hormones that brought east 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.060
 but just the main questions 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.970
 thanks to him fat cell 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.159
 releases fat into the bloodstream 

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:56.860
 molecules mass educational 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:58.220
 Presley process 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.050
 project but it will not accept 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.030
 connects to the receptors would this 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.310
 being on the surface of fat 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.320
 cell 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.119
 you again understand how sap after that he 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.179
 the police sends a second signal which 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:12.280
 increases the activity of special 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.459
 protein timing 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.069
 but called reserve with protests 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.109
 are these proteins not bound to 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.590
 fatty molecules and forcing them to leave 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.130
 polka dot polish kamaz then fatty 

00:02:24.129 --> 00:02:26.450
 molecules get into the blood and ignite 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.989
 thanks to shares one language 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.590
 cyc charisteas activity 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.140
 ap precisely for this reason they are the best in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.900
 bodybuilders take in front of 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.870
 training and as a result sekas hardcore
