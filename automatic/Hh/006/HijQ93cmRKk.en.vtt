rifle<00:00:53.670> this<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.899> fully<00:00:55.379> automatic<00:00:55.649> gun<00:00:56.180> with

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
rifle this is a fully automatic gun with

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.660 
rifle this is a fully automatic gun with
this<00:00:57.570> is<00:00:57.690> highest<00:00:58.230> rate<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.410> fire<00:00:58.649> I'm<00:00:59.219> not<00:00:59.489> so

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
this is highest rate of fire I'm not so

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.670 
this is highest rate of fire I'm not so
hot<00:01:00.300> actually<00:01:00.480> but<00:01:00.809> that's<00:01:01.199> not<00:01:01.320> for<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.559> hope

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
hot actually but that's not for the hope

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.149 
hot actually but that's not for the hope
I<00:01:01.770> think<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> well<00:01:03.600> looks<00:01:04.229> like<00:01:04.320> when

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
I think and this is well looks like when

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.859 
I think and this is well looks like when
you<00:01:05.250> zoom<00:01:05.400> in<00:01:05.549> it's<00:01:05.820> pretty<00:01:05.939> fast<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.510> think

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
you zoom in it's pretty fast I think

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.730 
you zoom in it's pretty fast I think
it's<00:01:06.990> faster<00:01:07.260> when<00:01:07.380> you<00:01:07.439> see<00:01:07.560> me<00:01:07.710> somehow<00:01:09.740> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
it's faster when you see me somehow and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.880 
it's faster when you see me somehow and
this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> what<00:01:11.580> let's<00:01:12.360> go<00:01:12.450> faster<00:01:12.720> anyway<00:01:13.320> they

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
this is what let's go faster anyway they

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.179 
this is what let's go faster anyway they
also<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.610> sniper<00:01:14.970> rifle<00:01:16.009> which<00:01:17.009> pretty

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
also have the sniper rifle which pretty
much<00:01:17.280> looks<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.610> this<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.659> zooming<00:01:19.140> and

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409
