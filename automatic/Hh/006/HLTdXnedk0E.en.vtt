00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.570
 hello this is the tutorial of how to play 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.310
 the song ighalo all in july version 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.800
 jaramillo this song is in the tone 

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:30.189
 of the minor if we put a capo in the 1st 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:34.140
 fret we play like it's a go to the 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.140
 first melody of the plucking is already 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:43.120
 to do this we are simply going to 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.120
 make this chord for minor 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.449
 and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.520
 good in our third position 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.860
 string 17 fret second string 18 and 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.980
 first string 16 we play all three and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.649
 then we play the third string then the 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.079
 second and the first at the same time 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:06.000
 we touch again that same position the 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:08.220
 third and the second the first are like this 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.900
 and 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.900
 then the next position is this 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:18.409
 to make this position we touch the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.390
 third string on the 15th second fret 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.570
 rope in the 16th and first which in the 15th 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:28.390
 we play third then 2nd and 1st at the same 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.390
 time again and then the third 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 then this same position of velux the 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:37.970
 we drag two sentences back 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.979
 we would be on the third string 13 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.299
 frets on a string 14 and first 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.860
 13 fret string 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:46.610
 we do the same rhythm that we did 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:51.220
 previously we played the three then 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.220
 third rope second and first board 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.110
 A) Yes 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.780
 and then this same position and the 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.260
 we drag a fret back and 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.440
 we play the three strings and then the 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.490
 third and the second 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.490
 they are like this phrase 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.269
 if its removing them do not arrive so 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:25.030
 high do not have as many frets as for 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.400
 get to this agreed I think so but 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.430
 just in case they can also do that 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.260
 same melody 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.260
 they can do so here 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.909
 so yes what is the faa agreement 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:48.689
 minor would play in the second and third 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.689
 then the third and fourth 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.410
 also with the agreed of re held in 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.410
 the same 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.940
 good because everything sustained has also 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.560
 run also 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.160
 that is the beginning now the next 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.160
 phrase is this 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.520
 to do this we play the third 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.520
 string on the eighth fret 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.790
 then ninth then tenth then second 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:22.670
 rope eighth fret ninth tenth and 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.030
 eleventh then third tenth string 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.330
 fret second rope eleventh first 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:32.290
 ninth string and we jump to the 13th fret 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:35.099
 and we played three times 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.099
 the phrase is like this 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.819
 the next sentence is this 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.860
 we had finished the previous sentence here 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.150
 in 13 to others of the first string 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.150
 we play again but we are going to do this 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.860
 position we leave the finger the index finger 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.840
 in the first tail thirteen other three what 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.960
 we put the middle finger in the second 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.510
 14 fret string and the ring finger on the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.750
 third string 15 ago back we would play 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.900
 first second third then second and 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.900
 first 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:13.550
 after having played the first string 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.330
 among others that we jump towards 18 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.930
 fret 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:23.810
 once then on the 16th we go back to 13 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.350
 and then second string 13 others of this 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.250
 They are like that 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.250
 ah 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.620
 the next sentence is this 

00:04:33.009 --> 00:04:37.360
 Y 

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.069
 to do this 

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.629
 we had finished the previous sentence here 

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.969
 on the thirteenth second second rope 

00:04:40.629 --> 00:04:44.289
 now we play the first string in 13 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:50.830
 or fret 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:52.389
 then the 15 16 15 13 12 then second 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.330
 14 fret string 

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:56.620
 then 13 then third rope whoever 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.129
 or fret 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:04.630
 then the twelfth and then fourth I agreed 

00:05:00.129 --> 00:05:07.770
 in 14 to others and then 15 frets 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.770
 this phrase sounds like this 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:14.589
 Y 

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:14.589
 and to finish this sentence 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.790
 we simply do the scale of fa 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.530
 minor we had finished the previous sentence 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.230
 here in 15 to others in the fourth 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.080
 we play again then third 

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:30.290
 12 string to 13 others 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:34.970
 then 15 then second string 13 fret 

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:37.750
 then 14 16 and we finish in the first 

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:37.750
 rope 13 back 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.290
 I will play with the count slowly 

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:48.290
 ah 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.900
 ah 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:57.900
 and later 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.900
 do not

 and that's the point thanks
