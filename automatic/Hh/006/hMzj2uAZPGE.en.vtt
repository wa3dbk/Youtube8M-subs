00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.759
 I wonder if there are many people ek 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.130
 is 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.519
 This time's ur beth over 

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:17.070
 This vegeta is cool, is n't it? 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:20.870
 This gilt 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.270
 I tried to make a secret-like silver foil 

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.410
 You are good 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.410
 Here you will 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.430
 It feels like this to silver foil 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.430
 I tried to 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.989
 It became quite cool finish 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.989
 The issuance of this time and is of hereabouts Hen Sengaa 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.989
 It was a little difficult 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:01.770
 You say that you can ferment well ? 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:05.129
 It is that sort of thing was a little difficult 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:11.210
 In here 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.210
 Somehow wants in each I think you something around here strangely 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:22.330
 It was difficult for these people to have something to say in the night 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:24.680
 It's hard to press 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.550
 It was feeling 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.720
 And this time new 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.700
 This say this 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.920
 Hiroshi Foleo 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.390
 What a wonder like this 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.560
 I also tried to stamp foil 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.450
 Though I'm around here around here it seemed still places the line is difficult 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.730
 This one 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.080
 Is a fool 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:51.080
 What put this 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.980
 Jazz and 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:55.980
 Here you will 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:05.320
 There is a place written with this vegeta 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.320
 Could you see that are aligned 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.200
 It became quite cool finish 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.210
 It feels like this when changing the angle so that this silver foil is easy to understand 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.100
 wood 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.320
 Silver foil 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.320
 Lower the 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.330
 Personally this is 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:49.290
 Holo foil squeezed jetter 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:50.790
 I thought it would be quite awkward to fail, but it was good to succeed in one shot somehow 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.330
 But this one 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:57.190
 very well 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:58.880
 Good fight shin do and it takes nearly 100 yen 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.750
 Because 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:08.680
 Well this precious that can not be made so much in the sun 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:08.680
 I think it would be good to be able to succeed in one shot of holo foil 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:18.520
 If this way is good 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:20.140
 Me divided vigor to Ola at the Good button 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.030

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:29.300
 Thank you in advance 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:32.170
