00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.869
 all right 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.010
 hello girls or I bring you one 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.740
 transformation that is special for this 

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.439
 Christmas is full of brightness and color 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:22.240
 but at the same time it is quite elegant and 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.599
 discreet but that does not stop 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.599
 highlight 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.790
 start with a moisturizer that is a 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.800
 I put it on my face and treat it 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.210
 I let him absorb with patting that's 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.070
 so that the skin is ready to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.470
 any product then I apply this 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.900
 first that pore filler I want 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.750
 see me perfect on this occasion 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.340
 special and now applies a base of 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.530
 long duration because we're going to be in 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.360
 a party I will qualify the use 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.920
 this mac corrector I'm going to put 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.440
 just a little drop because 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.180
 we want the base to be of our 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.400
 tone or a little bit darker is 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.469
 necessary so that it does not reflect the ugly 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.300
 flash as many times when taking the 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.790
 take pictures at night we see in a 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:04.290
 Most expensive aspect is fine and blender is 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.180
 the sponge that I'm using I'm 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.190
 using very wet and this is going to do 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.660
 that I cover perfectly the 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.720
 makeup but if there was any excess 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:15.030
 because I applied too much product 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.259
 Sponge absorbs it is amazing 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.550
 magical 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.369
 now let's apply a concealer 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.770
 below in the area of ​​the ojera and I'm going to 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.270
 apply this one of l color if it is color 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.219
 cream and beige 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.500
 and I'm going to apply it, I'm going to 

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:30.179
 take product only once apply 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.979
 under the eyes in all that is the 

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:34.110
 bag and I'm going to make it a kind of 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.740
 triangle down so it does not look 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:40.530
 the inverted raccoon effect that is ojera 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.720
 very clear but that they will fade 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.060
 the lighter tone 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.400
 as a very smooth gradient towards the 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.250
 area of ​​the cheeks and this way 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.740
 we illuminate without the wheel of the 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.080
 I heard in the photos especially now I'm going 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.600
 to apply a fixative with that is a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.060
 special powder under the eyes 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.890
 It is a powder corrector fixer very 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.890
 fine that will not make them be marked 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.320
 the wrinkles and now this this dust that 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.810
 It has a matte but glossy matte finish 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.610
 as radiant but does not look greasy is 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.860
 simply that it looks matte demands very 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.020
 okay the makeup but it does not have that 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.580
 look like cardboard that they have 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:20.820
 many other powders having some 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:23.130
 coverage now I'm going to outline 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.520
 using a cover grow game this 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:28.590
 it is matte as you can see it is a normal powder 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.959
 skin as if it were a compact powder 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.150
 for darker skin and that I'm going to 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.709
 use to sculpt my cheeks to 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.050
 that they look very well defined 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:38.340
 Factions in photographs is very 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.650
 important because the flash can do 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.330
 that factions are lost and I'm going to 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.620
 blur a little bit again with the 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.530
 viola and blender for a perfect finish 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.600
 and this is the basis that I'm going to use is 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.370
 an engineering eyeliner flame 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.650
 it's a little dry battaglia a little bit 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:55.440
 to apply it but it is the perfect color 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.500
 and it's going to make that green shadow that I'm going 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:00.570
 to use is this one of fl x adhere 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.120
 perfectly we are going to use this 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:07.740
 shade that is metallic is beautiful is a 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.110
 green olive dark super metallic I apply 

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:13.860
 with taps in the area where you apply 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:16.350
 this base eyeliner as a base and it is 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.640
 important that we always apply 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.070
 our shadows especially if they are 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.720
 shiny or with glitter we apply them to 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.600
 soft taps so that the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.130
 excess product our face and so 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.300
 I'm going to take it a little bit higher than 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.730
 fold this is going to be a look something 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.280
 dramatic in this case and I'm going to apply 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.590
 this in the basin is a color like wine 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.890
 but the base is pretty dark I've 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:43.920
 found that this kind of colors at 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:48.319
 be very blurry as they lose their 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:51.300
 color came its color its purple base 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:53.670
 blur is rather gray and has 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.190
 passed with different colors marks 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.250
 of this kind of colors of visu of more 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:02.250
 simply a wine color that has a base 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.590
 gray or dark base is always what happens to me 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.500
 same to blur we see in the basin 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:09.600
 where is the base the cream base there 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.610
 if the purple color clings a little 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:14.489
 but when it comes to blurring more 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:16.480
 go further more out of that area already 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.550
 it looks like grayish 

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:21.310
 I'm going to add a touch of color 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.320
 with this purple powder pencil 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.210
 I'm going to apply it at the bottom 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.660
 of the eye and with this shadow of julia 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:30.400
 Sanchez I'm going to apply that color 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:32.710
 outlined what I did to last me all 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.350
 night and intensify still the 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.880
 color and it approaches very well now I'm going 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.430
 with a gel eyeliner in their 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.990
 formula decisions is the color purple is 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.330
 pretty creamy I'm going to apply it 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:47.830
 only on the top line of the 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:50.920
 eyelashes this is a normal delineation and 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.870
 It will also add a lot of 

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:55.600
 presence to the look and now with this 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.500
 glitter eyeliner or nix glitter 

00:04:55.600 --> 00:05:03.490
 on the queen disk I'm going to delineate about 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:05.860
 the line of not on top of the color but 

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:09.310
 between the line of the purple color that I made 

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.350
 and the green shade or above the color 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.640
 purple I'm going to apply it as a line 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:17.890
 pretty defined with a lot of care 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:20.230
 this will make it much highlight 

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:22.680
 plus the look that looks much more festive 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:24.940
 and to clean a little bit of the area 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:27.850
 eyebrow bone to apply our 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.830
 mat shadow of julia sanchez I do not want 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.780
 nothing very shiny for the photos you 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:33.400
 They know that I prefer to always lean 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.890
 for the mates in this area is when the 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.710
 foto the blush is a very very natural pink 

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:41.920
 but applied in with enough quantity 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.980
 is from dior ghana and as you can see they are very 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:47.620
 very soft on the cheeks look very very 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.770
 soft but we apply quite 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.960
 amount to highlight the as it is what 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.600
 what I want and I will blur using 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.610
 a hair already apply the eyelashes 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.800
 false and the ones below I love you 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:01.810
 highlight a lot so that not for 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.050
 compete with the ones above and look 

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:06.940
 even very well arranged the eyelashes and 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:09.550
 then I will use a glitter that is 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:12.610
 A beige color of Jordan is very soft 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:15.960
 very moisturizing and parasite complement 

00:06:12.610 --> 00:06:19.740
 perfect the look is not very loaded 

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:23.370
 now we see how the look was 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.590
 colorful enough but really is not 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:27.569
 shocking because the colors that 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.970
 we use are dark 

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:33.509
 now I am using in this case some 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.639
 Cool contact lenses with lenses 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.330
 contact uruguay with gray colors 

00:06:35.639 --> 00:06:40.430
 lilacs 

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:43.430
 depending on each eye color the 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:46.550
 base of our own eye color is 

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:49.009
 that changes either more blue or macrista 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.169
 I love this this is the look that 

00:06:49.009 --> 00:06:53.180
 suit now for these holidays I hope 

00:06:51.169 --> 00:06:56.000
 that you liked that is not very 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:59.270
 elegant I repeat you very elegant have 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.819
 that pop of color to highlight our 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:04.099
 purple eyes that purple is very very

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:11.470
 good to gray eyes and 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:14.050
 In general, I liked this doctor a lot 

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.930
 colorful but unobtrusive yet if 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:19.810
 draws attention if you have in a 

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:21.580
 year party character looks very nice 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.310
