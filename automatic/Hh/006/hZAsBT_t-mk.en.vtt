00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
but I think that might kind of

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.870 
but I think that might kind of
counterbalance<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:29.070> sour<00:01:29.280> a<00:01:29.430> little<00:01:29.520> bit

counterbalance the sour a little bit

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.609 
counterbalance the sour a little bit

because we're gonna be using line so a
little<00:01:32.159> sprite<00:01:32.610> action<00:01:33.150> whoo<00:01:33.329> that<00:01:33.659> might<00:01:33.780> be

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
little sprite action whoo that might be

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.420

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
what we're gonna do is just make a

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.400 
what we're gonna do is just make a
little<00:04:22.680> twist<00:04:23.040> for<00:04:23.310> it<00:04:23.460> if<00:04:23.840> the<00:04:24.840> lime<00:04:25.050> skin

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
little twist for it if the lime skin

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.830 
little twist for it if the lime skin
will<00:04:25.560> allow<00:04:25.830> it<00:04:26.240> my<00:04:27.240> lines<00:04:27.480> are<00:04:27.690> always

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
will allow it my lines are always

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:36.400 
will allow it my lines are always
getting<00:04:28.200> bad<00:04:29.450> there<00:04:30.450> we<00:04:30.570> go<00:04:33.110> come<00:04:34.110> on<00:04:34.910> twist

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
getting bad there we go come on twist

getting bad there we go come on twist
twist

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
twist

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.990 
twist
well<00:04:40.850> that's<00:04:41.850> fairly<00:04:42.210> awful<00:04:42.660> but<00:04:43.700> what<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.730> did

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
well that's fairly awful but what I did

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.670 
well that's fairly awful but what I did
get<00:04:45.240> out<00:04:45.420> of<00:04:45.570> that<00:04:45.720> was<00:04:46.310> the<00:04:47.810> little<00:04:48.810> oilless

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
that shoot off land all over the drink

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:53.930 
that shoot off land all over the drink
and<00:04:52.350> you<00:04:52.800> know<00:04:52.890> even<00:04:53.220> if<00:04:53.310> you<00:04:53.400> if<00:04:53.550> you<00:04:53.669> want<00:04:53.850> to

and you know even if you if you want to
get<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.060> little<00:04:54.180> more<00:04:54.300> creative<00:04:54.480> you<00:04:54.750> can<00:04:54.960> rub<00:04:55.650> a

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
get a little more creative you can rub a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.580 
get a little more creative you can rub a
little<00:04:55.919> lime<00:04:56.790> on<00:04:57.030> the<00:04:57.150> edges<00:04:57.510> to<00:04:58.020> just<00:04:58.260> make<00:04:58.560> a

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
little lime on the edges to just make a

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.770 
little lime on the edges to just make a
little<00:04:58.800> extra<00:04:59.070> sour<00:04:59.370> for<00:04:59.640> you<00:04:59.820> and<00:05:00.390> you<00:05:00.570> get<00:05:00.750> a

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:14.699 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:19.189 

well<00:05:15.840> there<00:05:16.840> is<00:05:16.990> it's<00:05:17.289> very<00:05:17.650> easy

00:05:19.189 --> 00:05:19.199 
well there is it's very easy

00:05:19.199 --> 00:05:21.900 
well there is it's very easy
zing<00:05:20.199> e<00:05:20.229> because<00:05:20.979> you've<00:05:21.130> got<00:05:21.280> that<00:05:21.430> you've

got the the club soda really bubbling up
in<00:05:24.310> there<00:05:24.960> this<00:05:25.960> is<00:05:26.199> kind<00:05:26.380> of<00:05:26.440> dangerous

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
in there this is kind of dangerous

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:30.689 
in there this is kind of dangerous
because<00:05:26.949> you're<00:05:27.220> getting<00:05:28.620> the<00:05:29.620> so<00:05:29.860> she<00:05:29.919> hides

because you're getting the so she hides
a<00:05:30.970> show<00:05:31.180> to<00:05:31.360> hide<00:05:31.539> really<00:05:31.870> well<00:05:32.050> in<00:05:32.199> here<00:05:32.380> and

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
a show to hide really well in here and

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.890 
a show to hide really well in here and
it<00:05:33.190> brings<00:05:33.460> up<00:05:33.729> some<00:05:34.000> of<00:05:34.509> these<00:05:34.599> neat<00:05:34.870> little

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
it brings up some of these neat little

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.430 
it brings up some of these neat little
textures<00:05:35.530> that<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.770> shochu<00:05:36.130> has<00:05:36.340> in<00:05:36.550> it

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:37.440 
textures that the shochu has in it

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.270 
textures that the shochu has in it
little<00:05:38.440> sweetness

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
little sweetness

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.779 
little sweetness
maybe<00:05:39.789> not<00:05:40.210> yeast<00:05:40.660> but<00:05:40.930> like<00:05:41.169> a<00:05:41.199> little<00:05:42.190> maybe

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
maybe not yeast but like a little maybe

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:45.839 
maybe not yeast but like a little maybe
not<00:05:43.780> sock<00:05:44.380> a<00:05:44.590> but<00:05:44.889> it<00:05:45.039> kind<00:05:45.220> of<00:05:45.280> falls<00:05:45.520> in<00:05:45.729> that

00:05:45.839 --> 00:05:45.849 
not sock a but it kind of falls in that

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:49.409 
not sock a but it kind of falls in that
if<00:05:45.940> you've<00:05:46.120> had<00:05:46.150> sock<00:05:46.750> a<00:05:46.930> it's<00:05:47.620> a<00:05:47.910> just<00:05:48.910> subtle

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:49.419 
if you've had sock a it's a just subtle

00:05:49.419 --> 00:05:50.820 
if you've had sock a it's a just subtle
enough<00:05:49.599> with<00:05:49.870> a<00:05:49.900> few<00:05:50.139> little<00:05:50.349> nuances<00:05:50.500> of

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
enough with a few little nuances of

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:53.370 
enough with a few little nuances of
flavors<00:05:51.340> and<00:05:51.460> then<00:05:51.910> you've<00:05:52.030> got<00:05:52.210> the<00:05:52.419> limes<00:05:53.050> in

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380 
flavors and then you've got the limes in

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.860 
flavors and then you've got the limes in
there<00:05:53.530> which<00:05:53.710> you<00:05:54.039> know<00:05:54.550> little<00:05:54.940> limes<00:05:55.150> not<00:05:55.690> so

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:55.870 
there which you know little limes not so

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:57.420 
there which you know little limes not so
bad<00:05:56.050> and<00:05:56.289> then<00:05:56.410> at<00:05:56.620> the<00:05:56.710> end<00:05:56.740> you're<00:05:57.130> getting

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
bad and then at the end you're getting

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.490 
bad and then at the end you're getting
the<00:05:57.520> Angostura<00:05:58.030> bitters<00:05:58.360> which<00:05:58.570> are<00:05:59.020> very

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
the Angostura bitters which are very

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.070 
the Angostura bitters which are very
impressive<00:06:00.430> when<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.389> bring<00:06:01.659> them<00:06:01.840> into<00:06:01.990> a

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
impressive when you bring them into a

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.320 
impressive when you bring them into a
drink<00:06:02.440> not<00:06:02.740> so<00:06:02.919> good<00:06:03.070> by<00:06:03.190> themselves<00:06:03.699> and<00:06:03.970> you

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:04.330 
drink not so good by themselves and you

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.210 
drink not so good by themselves and you
can<00:06:04.840> even<00:06:04.960> see<00:06:05.169> the<00:06:05.349> didn't<00:06:05.830> can't<00:06:06.099> probably

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
can even see the didn't can't probably

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.529

can't<00:06:06.490> see<00:06:06.610> it<00:06:06.639> here<00:06:06.849> but<00:06:06.970> there's<00:06:07.180> a<00:06:07.270> little

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:07.539 
can't see it here but there's a little

00:06:07.539 --> 00:06:13.350 
can't see it here but there's a little
slight<00:06:08.139> orange<00:06:08.590> tinge<00:06:08.919> to<00:06:09.039> it<00:06:12.270> looking<00:06:13.270> out

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
slight orange tinge to it looking out

slight orange tinge to it looking out
you<00:06:13.509> see<00:06:13.630> that<00:06:13.659> goes<00:06:13.930> down<00:06:14.340> this<00:06:15.340> could<00:06:15.490> be

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
you see that goes down this could be

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.379 
you see that goes down this could be
quite<00:06:15.909> dangerous

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:16.389 
quite dangerous

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:19.409 
quite dangerous
