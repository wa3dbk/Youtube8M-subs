00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:09.340 
Roger's house they know they expect the

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.509 
Roger's house they know they expect the
unexpected<00:04:10.290> I<00:04:11.290> think<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.739> respite<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.280> is

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
unexpected I think the respite is is

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.580 
unexpected I think the respite is is
really<00:04:12.880> important<00:04:13.510> but<00:04:13.690> I<00:04:14.019> think<00:04:14.349> it's<00:04:14.500> a

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
really important but I think it's a

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.949 
really important but I think it's a
support<00:04:14.950> that<00:04:15.099> matters<00:04:15.400> most<00:04:15.910> to<00:04:16.060> me<00:04:16.209> the<00:04:16.810> last

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
support that matters most to me the last

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.199 
support that matters most to me the last
couple<00:04:17.109> months<00:04:17.380> would<00:04:17.620> have<00:04:17.709> been<00:04:17.799> I<00:04:18.209> don't

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
couple months would have been I don't

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:20.280 
couple months would have been I don't
know<00:04:19.359> we<00:04:19.600> would<00:04:19.720> have<00:04:19.810> gotten<00:04:19.959> through<00:04:20.139> them

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.290 
know we would have gotten through them

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:22.710 
know we would have gotten through them
otherwise<00:04:20.560> I<00:04:20.769> think<00:04:20.799> they<00:04:21.130> just<00:04:22.120> just<00:04:22.600> have

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
otherwise I think they just just have

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.360 
otherwise I think they just just have
them<00:04:22.930> here<00:04:23.080> and<00:04:23.229> having<00:04:23.410> to<00:04:23.740> support<00:04:23.889> us<00:04:24.160> and
