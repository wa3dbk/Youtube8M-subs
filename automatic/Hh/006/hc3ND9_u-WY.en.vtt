tutorial for feather band this design is
stitched<00:00:05.750> by<00:00:06.050> first<00:00:06.410> starting<00:00:06.980> with<00:00:07.490> a<00:00:07.730> row<00:00:08.180> of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:08.510 
stitched by first starting with a row of

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.890 
stitched by first starting with a row of
feathers<00:00:08.840> and<00:00:09.490> it's<00:00:10.490> a<00:00:10.760> little<00:00:11.180> tricky<00:00:11.450> to<00:00:11.600> get

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:11.900 
feathers and it's a little tricky to get

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.350 
feathers and it's a little tricky to get
started<00:00:12.470> to<00:00:12.620> be<00:00:12.800> perfectly<00:00:13.280> honest<00:00:13.760> simply

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:14.360 
started to be perfectly honest simply

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.239 
started to be perfectly honest simply
because<00:00:14.510> feathers<00:00:15.349> in<00:00:15.680> order<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.070> be

00:00:16.239 --> 00:00:16.249 
because feathers in order to be

00:00:16.249 --> 00:00:18.700 
because feathers in order to be
beautiful<00:00:16.820> and<00:00:17.029> flowing<00:00:17.539> can<00:00:18.109> I<00:00:18.140> have<00:00:18.409> to<00:00:18.529> have

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
beautiful and flowing can I have to have

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:21.880 
beautiful and flowing can I have to have
a<00:00:18.919> slight<00:00:19.339> arch<00:00:19.669> to<00:00:20.029> them<00:00:20.210> so<00:00:21.140> getting<00:00:21.380> started

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:21.890 
a slight arch to them so getting started

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.559 
a slight arch to them so getting started
you<00:00:22.039> want<00:00:22.220> to<00:00:22.310> just<00:00:22.460> start<00:00:22.699> with<00:00:22.909> a<00:00:22.939> teardrop

00:00:23.559 --> 00:00:23.569 
you want to just start with a teardrop

00:00:23.569 --> 00:00:25.329 
you want to just start with a teardrop
shape<00:00:23.810> and<00:00:24.079> then<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.470> rest<00:00:24.650> of<00:00:24.859> your<00:00:24.949> feathers

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
shape and then the rest of your feathers

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:27.790 
shape and then the rest of your feathers
will<00:00:25.579> kind<00:00:25.789> of<00:00:25.880> build<00:00:26.239> off<00:00:26.689> of<00:00:26.720> that<00:00:26.960> shape<00:00:27.499> and

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
will kind of build off of that shape and

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.579 
will kind of build off of that shape and
that<00:00:28.369> will<00:00:28.550> give<00:00:28.579> them<00:00:28.880> a<00:00:28.970> nice<00:00:29.179> arch<00:00:29.589> another

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
that will give them a nice arch another

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.229 
that will give them a nice arch another
idea<00:00:31.009> would<00:00:31.159> be<00:00:31.220> to<00:00:31.429> start<00:00:31.489> with<00:00:31.849> maybe<00:00:32.059> a

00:00:32.229 --> 00:00:32.239 
idea would be to start with maybe a

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:33.970 
idea would be to start with maybe a
circle<00:00:32.960> and<00:00:33.140> that<00:00:33.440> way<00:00:33.590> they'll<00:00:33.769> have<00:00:33.949> a

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:33.980 
circle and that way they'll have a

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.479 
circle and that way they'll have a
really<00:00:34.640> nice<00:00:35.180> curvy<00:00:35.960> shape<00:00:36.260> to<00:00:36.530> them<00:00:36.680> it's

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
really nice curvy shape to them it's

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.369 
really nice curvy shape to them it's
entirely<00:00:38.120> up<00:00:38.329> to<00:00:38.629> you<00:00:38.719> it's<00:00:38.899> a<00:00:38.989> design<00:00:39.350> that

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
don't judge it by that because this

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.970 
don't judge it by that because this
design<00:00:46.850> could<00:00:47.059> easily<00:00:47.629> become<00:00:48.199> a<00:00:48.410> really

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:48.980 
design could easily become a really

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
see I stitch this feather interlocking

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.080 
see I stitch this feather interlocking
it<00:01:21.110> with<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.650> line<00:01:21.830> before<00:01:22.070> and<00:01:22.610> now<00:01:22.910> I'm

it with the line before and now I'm
travel<00:01:23.570> stitching<00:01:23.930> up<00:01:24.050> the<00:01:24.260> side<00:01:24.470> of<00:01:24.650> that

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
travel stitching up the side of that

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.670 
travel stitching up the side of that
feather<00:01:25.040> and<00:01:25.370> I'm<00:01:26.000> going<00:01:26.240> to<00:01:26.330> overlap<00:01:26.690> it<00:01:27.110> with

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
feather and I'm going to overlap it with

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.880 
feather and I'm going to overlap it with
the<00:01:27.860> feather<00:01:28.160> on<00:01:28.580> the<00:01:28.850> opposite<00:01:29.300> side<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:30.830> is

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:30.890 
the feather on the opposite side this is

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.010 
the feather on the opposite side this is
an<00:01:31.130> edge<00:01:31.310> to<00:01:31.340> center<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.150> design<00:01:32.450> so<00:01:32.870> I'm

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
an edge to center to design so I'm

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.530 
an edge to center to design so I'm
working<00:01:33.560> from<00:01:33.770> one<00:01:34.040> edge<00:01:34.340> into<00:01:34.910> the<00:01:34.940> center<00:01:35.090> at

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
working from one edge into the center at

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.680 
working from one edge into the center at
all<00:01:35.690> times<00:01:36.020> and<00:01:36.530> it<00:01:37.130> works<00:01:37.370> really<00:01:38.000> well<00:01:38.210> in

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
all times and it works really well in

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.230 
all times and it works really well in
rows<00:01:39.250> this<00:01:40.250> means<00:01:40.520> that<00:01:40.640> this<00:01:40.850> design<00:01:41.210> is

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
rows this means that this design is

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.750 
rows this means that this design is
going<00:01:41.660> to<00:01:41.780> work<00:01:41.960> excellently<00:01:42.830> in<00:01:43.130> straight

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
going to work excellently in straight

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.560 
going to work excellently in straight
narrow<00:01:44.240> areas<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:44.990> sashing<00:01:45.680> or<00:01:45.950> borders

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
narrow areas like sashing or borders

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.820 
narrow areas like sashing or borders
sashing<00:01:47.570> especially<00:01:48.140> will<00:01:48.290> be<00:01:48.410> where<00:01:48.620> this

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:48.830 
sashing especially will be where this

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:52.390 
sashing especially will be where this
design<00:01:49.250> really<00:01:49.730> shines<00:01:50.060> it<00:01:50.540> creates<00:01:51.380> a<00:01:51.710> really

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:52.400 
design really shines it creates a really

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.810 
design really shines it creates a really
soft<00:01:53.140> horizontal<00:01:54.140> or<00:01:54.530> vertical<00:01:54.560> very<00:01:55.400> soft

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
soft horizontal or vertical very soft

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:58.030 
soft horizontal or vertical very soft
subtle<00:01:56.120> flowing<00:01:56.720> texture<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.440> that's

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 
subtle flowing texture and that's
