itself<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:58.079> case<00:00:58.320> itself<00:00:58.769> is<00:00:59.070> basically<00:00:59.699> a

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
itself the case itself is basically a

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.070 
itself the case itself is basically a
take<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.500> alon<00:01:01.890> form<00:01:02.489> but<00:01:03.000> in<00:01:03.120> a<00:01:03.210> plasticky

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
take on the alon form but in a plasticky

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.440 
take on the alon form but in a plasticky
slider<00:01:04.470> fashion<00:01:05.190> i<00:01:05.370> may<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:05.850> wrong<00:01:05.970> but<00:01:06.150> it

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
slider fashion i may be wrong but it

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.210 
slider fashion i may be wrong but it
looks<00:01:06.810> to<00:01:07.050> me<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.230> they're<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.770> using<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
looks to me like they're just using the

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.399 
looks to me like they're just using the
exact<00:01:08.610> mold<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.570> they<00:01:09.720> used<00:01:09.930> to<00:01:10.050> make<00:01:10.230> the

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
exact mold that they used to make the

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.790 
exact mold that they used to make the
alon<00:01:10.710> form<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.730> make<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.240> shade<00:01:12.510> case<00:01:12.930> so<00:01:13.590> it's

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:13.800 
alon form to make the shade case so it's

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.640 
alon form to make the shade case so it's
basically<00:01:14.010> a<00:01:14.310> two-piece<00:01:14.909> case<00:01:15.240> slider<00:01:16.200> style

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
basically a two-piece case slider style

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.980 
basically a two-piece case slider style
you<00:01:17.280> notice<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.760> inside<00:01:18.210> is<00:01:18.540> really<00:01:18.840> nice

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you notice the inside is really nice

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.930 
you notice the inside is really nice
it's<00:01:19.230> lined<00:01:19.500> with<00:01:19.650> this<00:01:19.890> kind<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.310> wet<00:01:20.610> suit

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940

soft<00:01:21.390> touch<00:01:21.660> material<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:22.800> will<00:01:22.830> prevent

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
soft touch material which will prevent

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.560 
soft touch material which will prevent
the<00:01:23.400> back<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.790> your<00:01:23.880> phone<00:01:24.090> from<00:01:24.300> being

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:30.870 
with that material so you don't really

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.230 
with that material so you don't really
need<00:01:31.110> any<00:01:31.290> rails<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:32.130> also<00:01:32.340> does<00:01:32.670> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.910> notch

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
need any rails it also does have a notch

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.860 
need any rails it also does have a notch
you<00:01:33.810> can<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.200> there<00:01:34.740> along<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:35.520> inside

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:35.870 
you can see that there along the inside

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:39.050 
you can see that there along the inside
for<00:01:36.870> the<00:01:37.140> vibrate<00:01:37.800> switch<00:01:37.980> to<00:01:38.340> run<00:01:38.490> along<00:01:38.790> as

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
for the vibrate switch to run along as

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.330 
for the vibrate switch to run along as
it<00:01:39.210> runs<00:01:39.420> up<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:39.660> track<00:01:40.050> and<00:01:40.380> again<00:01:41.010> it's<00:01:41.250> a

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
it runs up the track and again it's a

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.340 
it runs up the track and again it's a
two<00:01:41.520> piece<00:01:41.730> style<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.180> slider<00:01:42.450> case<00:01:42.750> so

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
two piece style to slider case so

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.900 
two piece style to slider case so
inserting<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:44.010> can<00:01:44.160> either<00:01:44.280> go<00:01:44.460> top<00:01:44.700> or

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:44.910 
inserting it you can either go top or

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:46.130 
inserting it you can either go top or
bottom<00:01:45.060> purse<00:01:45.360> it<00:01:45.540> really<00:01:45.750> doesn't<00:01:46.020> matter

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
bottom purse it really doesn't matter

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.560 
bottom purse it really doesn't matter
it's<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.250> vibrate<00:01:48.000> switch<00:01:48.180> I

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
it's good to have your vibrate switch I

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.870 
it's good to have your vibrate switch I
think<00:01:49.080> down<00:01:49.410> when<00:01:50.070> you<00:01:50.160> put<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.400> on<00:01:50.520> and<00:01:50.820> then

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
think down when you put it on and then

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.690 
think down when you put it on and then
it<00:01:51.630> just<00:01:51.660> simply<00:01:51.990> slides<00:01:52.440> in<00:01:52.740> so<00:01:53.280> once<00:01:53.460> you<00:01:53.580> get

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
it just simply slides in so once you get

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.540 
it just simply slides in so once you get
the<00:01:53.820> top<00:01:54.060> part<00:01:54.450> all<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.810> way<00:01:54.900> connected<00:01:55.550> turn

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
the top part all the way connected turn

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:58.430 
the top part all the way connected turn
it<00:01:56.640> over<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.090> slide<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> bottom<00:01:58.080> piece<00:01:58.260> on

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
it over and slide the bottom piece on

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.010 
it over and slide the bottom piece on
slides<00:01:59.130> together<00:01:59.400> really<00:01:59.880> nicely<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.810> wet

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
slides together really nicely that wet

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.510 
slides together really nicely that wet
suit<00:02:01.260> material<00:02:01.410> although<00:02:01.950> you<00:02:02.130> think<00:02:02.430> it

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
suit material although you think it

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.940 
suit material although you think it
might<00:02:02.670> kind<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.510> hold<00:02:03.780> up<00:02:04.050> the<00:02:04.320> case<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.530> being

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
might kind of hold up the case and being

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.830 
might kind of hold up the case and being
installed<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.580> doesn't<00:02:06.000> slides<00:02:06.360> right<00:02:06.600> along

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
installed it doesn't slides right along

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.350 
installed it doesn't slides right along
quite<00:02:07.290> nice<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:08.220> can<00:02:08.369> see<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> fit<00:02:08.940> it's

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
quite nice and you can see the fit it's

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.509 
quite nice and you can see the fit it's
actually<00:02:09.810> perfect<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.500> really<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.220> the<00:02:11.400> fit

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
actually perfect I really like the fit

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.460 
actually perfect I really like the fit
of<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.730> case<00:02:11.940> you<00:02:12.510> know<00:02:12.540> one<00:02:13.170> thing<00:02:13.349> I<00:02:13.440> always

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of the case you know one thing I always

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.440 
of the case you know one thing I always
look<00:02:13.830> for<00:02:14.040> when<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.280> put<00:02:14.489> a<00:02:14.519> slider<00:02:14.790> case<00:02:15.000> on<00:02:15.239> is

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
look for when I put a slider case on is

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.420 
look for when I put a slider case on is
do<00:02:15.629> these<00:02:15.750> notches<00:02:16.080> lineup<00:02:16.769> you<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.250> is

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
do these notches lineup you know is

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.280 
do these notches lineup you know is
there<00:02:17.610> a<00:02:17.640> noticeable<00:02:18.360> kind<00:02:18.690> of<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:19.260> know

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
there a noticeable kind of you know

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.320 
there a noticeable kind of you know
break<00:02:19.709> there<00:02:20.069> and<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.460> answer<00:02:20.700> to<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.120> no

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
break there and the answer to this is no

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.120 
break there and the answer to this is no
it<00:02:21.510> really<00:02:21.630> lines<00:02:21.930> up<00:02:22.110> you<00:02:22.530> know<00:02:22.620> it<00:02:22.830> kind<00:02:23.010> of

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
it really lines up you know it kind of

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.460 
it really lines up you know it kind of
looks<00:02:23.400> like<00:02:23.490> one<00:02:23.610> fluid<00:02:24.270> piece<00:02:24.750> one

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
looks like one fluid piece one

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.340 
looks like one fluid piece one
fluid<00:02:25.860> case<00:02:26.130> on<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.180> back<00:02:27.360> you<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:27.960> see<00:02:28.080> the

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
fluid case on the back you can see the

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:29.960 
fluid case on the back you can see the
camera<00:02:28.680> lens<00:02:28.800> there<00:02:29.130> it<00:02:29.340> lines<00:02:29.550> up<00:02:29.730> absolutely

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
camera lens there it lines up absolutely

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.510 
camera lens there it lines up absolutely
nicely<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:30.870> cutout<00:02:31.260> on<00:02:31.440> the<00:02:32.100> bottom

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
nicely in the cutout on the bottom

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.660 
nicely in the cutout on the bottom
they've<00:02:32.970> kind<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.270> taken<00:02:33.330> the<00:02:33.720> design<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.710> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
they've kind of taken the design of the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.150 
they've kind of taken the design of the
case<00:02:36.090> made<00:02:36.330> smooth<00:02:36.720> or<00:02:37.020> vice<00:02:37.200> versa<00:02:37.500> I<00:02:37.860> don't

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
case made smooth or vice versa I don't

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
case made smooth or vice versa I don't
really<00:02:38.280> know<00:02:38.460> which<00:02:38.610> came<00:02:38.850> first<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.360> it's

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
really know which came first and it's

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.890 
really know which came first and it's
one<00:02:40.380> large<00:02:40.770> cutout<00:02:41.130> on<00:02:41.280> the<00:02:41.730> bottom<00:02:42.090> and<00:02:42.270> then

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
one large cutout on the bottom and then

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.950 
one large cutout on the bottom and then
one<00:02:43.230> large<00:02:43.680> cutout<00:02:44.130> on<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.700> top<00:02:44.960> personally

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:45.960 
one large cutout on the top personally

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.840 
one large cutout on the top personally
I'm<00:02:46.080> kind<00:02:46.350> of<00:02:46.440> not<00:02:46.860> sure<00:02:47.190> whether<00:02:47.370> I'm<00:02:47.550> a<00:02:47.670> fan

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
I'm kind of not sure whether I'm a fan

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.480 
I'm kind of not sure whether I'm a fan
of<00:02:47.880> this<00:02:48.120> giant<00:02:48.930> cut<00:02:49.140> out<00:02:49.290> on<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.530> top<00:02:49.770> or<00:02:50.010> not

of this giant cut out on the top or not

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.880 
of this giant cut out on the top or not

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.800 
to it no problem you don't have to
fumble<00:02:56.070> around<00:02:56.250> and<00:02:56.610> find<00:02:56.880> it<00:02:57.090> on<00:02:57.300> the<00:02:57.600> other

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
fumble around and find it on the other

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.570 
fumble around and find it on the other
hand<00:02:57.990> it<00:02:58.170> does<00:02:58.320> leave<00:02:58.530> a<00:02:58.560> lot<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.100> top<00:02:59.340> of

hand it does leave a lot of the top of
the<00:02:59.730> phone<00:02:59.970> i<00:03:00.260> think<00:03:01.260> i<00:03:01.470> actually<00:03:01.650> prefer<00:03:01.980> the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
the phone i think i actually prefer the

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.949 
the phone i think i actually prefer the
opposite<00:03:02.850> way<00:03:03.000> when<00:03:03.209> they<00:03:03.300> have<00:03:03.420> individual

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
opposite way when they have individual

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.560 
opposite way when they have individual
cutouts<00:03:04.320> for<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:04.980> sleep<00:03:05.940> awake<00:03:06.240> and<00:03:06.480> the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
cutouts for the sleep awake and the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.570 
cutouts for the sleep awake and the
headset<00:03:06.990> jack<00:03:07.230> yeah<00:03:07.890> that<00:03:08.070> means<00:03:08.250> you<00:03:08.370> can't

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
headset jack yeah that means you can't

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.610 
headset jack yeah that means you can't
access<00:03:08.880> your<00:03:08.940> SIM<00:03:09.240> card<00:03:09.480> tray<00:03:09.540> but<00:03:09.930> how<00:03:10.410> often

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
access your SIM card tray but how often

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.490 
access your SIM card tray but how often
do<00:03:10.830> you<00:03:10.890> really<00:03:11.190> do<00:03:11.370> that<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.820> the<00:03:12.780> side<00:03:12.990> there

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
do you really do that on the side there

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.560 
do you really do that on the side there
is<00:03:13.530> one<00:03:13.830> large<00:03:14.100> cutout<00:03:14.550> for<00:03:14.970> your<00:03:15.209> vibrate

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
is one large cutout for your vibrate

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.570 
is one large cutout for your vibrate
switch<00:03:15.750> and<00:03:16.170> your<00:03:16.500> volume<00:03:17.010> rocker<00:03:17.280> and

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:17.580 
switch and your volume rocker and

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.430 
switch and your volume rocker and
there's<00:03:18.090> no<00:03:18.330> problem<00:03:18.780> accessing<00:03:19.170> that

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
there's no problem accessing that

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960 
there's no problem accessing that
vibrate<00:03:19.830> switch<00:03:19.950> because<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.370> cutout<00:03:20.640> is<00:03:20.790> so

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
vibrate switch because the cutout is so

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.970 
vibrate switch because the cutout is so
big<00:03:21.209> you<00:03:21.450> can<00:03:21.780> get<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.050> it<00:03:22.140> no<00:03:22.290> problem<00:03:22.709> and

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
big you can get to it no problem and

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.650 
big you can get to it no problem and
then<00:03:23.370> as<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.700> mentioned<00:03:24.060> this<00:03:24.120> is<00:03:24.300> a<00:03:24.330> slider

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
then as I mentioned this is a slider

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.720 
then as I mentioned this is a slider
style<00:03:24.959> case<00:03:25.290> you<00:03:25.800> can<00:03:25.980> see<00:03:26.010> where<00:03:26.310> it<00:03:26.400> gets<00:03:26.520> the

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
style case you can see where it gets the

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.360 
style case you can see where it gets the
name<00:03:26.850> shade<00:03:27.270> as<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.690> color<00:03:28.350> kind<00:03:28.680> of<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.340> know

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370
