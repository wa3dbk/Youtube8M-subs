00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
thousand it depends on the complexity

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.839 
thousand it depends on the complexity
so<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:37.990> more<00:04:38.169> characters<00:04:38.710> that<00:04:38.860> you<00:04:38.919> add<00:04:39.159> the

so the more characters that you add the

00:04:39.849 --> 00:04:42.149 
so the more characters that you add the

wilder to design the heartache we have

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:44.040 
wilder to design the heartache we have
to<00:04:42.280> make<00:04:42.430> a<00:04:42.460> structure<00:04:42.939> for<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.330> then<00:04:43.870> the
