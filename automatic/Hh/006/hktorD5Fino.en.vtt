so<00:02:49.280> what<00:02:49.819> we've<00:02:49.940> done<00:02:49.970> initially<00:02:50.720> with<00:02:51.110> a

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
so what we've done initially with a

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.420 
so what we've done initially with a
single<00:02:51.500> step<00:02:51.680> which<00:02:52.010> was<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> laser

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
single step which was a laser

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.580 
single step which was a laser
application<00:02:53.120> right<00:02:53.420> of<00:02:53.600> course<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:54.079> lot<00:02:54.200> of

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
application right of course a lot of

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.830 
application right of course a lot of
screen<00:02:54.829> printers<00:02:55.160> already<00:02:55.579> have<00:02:55.850> a<00:02:56.120> child<00:02:56.390> yes

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
screen printers already have a child yes

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.229 
screen printers already have a child yes
that's<00:02:57.440> true<00:02:57.680> so<00:02:57.920> subsequently<00:02:58.579> we<00:02:58.790> came<00:02:59.030> out

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
that's true so subsequently we came out

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.110 
that's true so subsequently we came out
with<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.570> with<00:02:59.870> the<00:02:59.959> paper<00:03:00.310> it's<00:03:01.310> called<00:03:01.549> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
with it with the paper it's called a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.410 
with it with the paper it's called a

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
11 or 11 17 so that you can get that

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.830 
11 or 11 17 so that you can get that
bigger<00:03:08.810> bigger<00:03:09.410> print<00:03:10.329> printed<00:03:11.329> out<00:03:11.450> on<00:03:11.630> your

and we have our we have our shirt yeah
and<00:03:28.340> the<00:03:28.459> nice<00:03:28.609> interesting<00:03:29.090> thing<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.630> that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
and the nice interesting thing is that

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.300 
and the nice interesting thing is that
when<00:03:29.930> people<00:03:30.079> look<00:03:30.380> at<00:03:30.530> this<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.709> lot<00:03:30.980> of<00:03:31.100> times

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
when people look at this a lot of times

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:32.860 
when people look at this a lot of times
they<00:03:31.519> may<00:03:31.700> think<00:03:32.000> it's<00:03:32.269> hard<00:03:32.420> to<00:03:32.510> see<00:03:32.660> in<00:03:32.780> the

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
they may think it's hard to see in the

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.740 
they may think it's hard to see in the
camera<00:03:33.200> I<00:03:33.260> would<00:03:33.440> assume<00:03:33.680> but<00:03:34.400> the<00:03:35.209> color<00:03:35.540> is<00:03:35.630> a

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 
camera I would assume but the color is a

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.199 
camera I would assume but the color is a
little<00:03:35.840> muted<00:03:36.410> right<00:03:37.040> but<00:03:37.340> once<00:03:37.579> you<00:03:37.820> print<00:03:38.120> it

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
little muted right but once you print it

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.470 
little muted right but once you print it
onto<00:03:39.019> a<00:03:39.049> shirt<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.890> pops<00:03:40.760> a<00:03:40.940> little<00:03:40.970> bit<00:03:41.269> mocks

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
onto a shirt it pops a little bit mocks

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:44.840 
onto a shirt it pops a little bit mocks
up<00:03:41.720> dramatically<00:03:42.410> so

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
up dramatically so

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.840 
up dramatically so
that's<00:03:44.970> one<00:03:45.450> of<00:03:45.540> our<00:03:45.660> other<00:03:45.810> areas<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:47.130> other

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
that's one of our other areas the other

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.300 
that's one of our other areas the other
aspect<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.570> that<00:03:48.660> we've<00:03:49.260> also<00:03:49.470> are<00:03:49.950> just

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
aspect is that we've also are just

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.000 
aspect is that we've also are just
coming<00:03:50.490> out<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:50.880> a<00:03:50.910> new<00:03:51.000> product<00:03:51.360> called

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
coming out with a new product called

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.480 
coming out with a new product called
single<00:03:53.010> print<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:54.330> has<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.630> multi<00:03:55.140> surface<00:03:55.490> okay

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:56.490

you can transfer this on to items that

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:23.270 
you can transfer this on to items that
you<00:04:22.170> know<00:04:22.290> it's<00:04:22.410> not<00:04:22.560> like<00:04:22.770> sublimation

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
you know it's not like sublimation

you know it's not like sublimation
there's<00:04:23.610> no<00:04:23.790> it's<00:04:24.060> not<00:04:24.210> a<00:04:24.240> special<00:04:24.750> product<00:04:25.020> it

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
there's no it's not a special product it

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.720 
there's no it's not a special product it
doesn't<00:04:25.680> have<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.830> polymer<00:04:26.250> coating<00:04:26.610> or

doesn't have a polymer coating or
anything<00:04:27.030> erect<00:04:27.960> so<00:04:28.080> this<00:04:28.230> is<00:04:28.380> just<00:04:28.500> like<00:04:28.620> a

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:28.740 
anything erect so this is just like a

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.470 
anything erect so this is just like a
ceramic<00:04:29.250> mug<00:04:29.430> could<00:04:29.640> I<00:04:29.700> go<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:29.880> Walmart<00:04:30.360> and

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:32.220 
buy one like off the shelf as a matter

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.160 
buy one like off the shelf as a matter
of<00:04:32.340> fact<00:04:32.400> we<00:04:32.670> bought<00:04:32.850> this<00:04:33.030> at<00:04:33.270> target<00:04:33.630> so<00:04:33.960> hard

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:35.900 
alibi might actually work because we
actually<00:05:34.740> have<00:05:34.860> the<00:05:35.040> high<00:05:35.160> temperature<00:05:35.640> right

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
actually have the high temperature right

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.310 
actually have the high temperature right
long<00:05:36.270> as<00:05:36.390> you<00:05:36.480> keep<00:05:36.600> it<00:05:36.750> in<00:05:36.870> there<00:05:36.990> for<00:05:37.020> that

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:37.320 
long as you keep it in there for that

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:39.500 
long as you keep it in there for that
length<00:05:37.590> of<00:05:37.740> time<00:05:37.800> okay<00:05:38.310> but<00:05:38.880> what<00:05:39.210> it<00:05:39.360> does

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
length of time okay but what it does

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:41.120 
length of time okay but what it does
make<00:05:39.870> it<00:05:40.050> a<00:05:40.080> little<00:05:40.140> bakes<00:05:40.590> it<00:05:40.740> a<00:05:40.800> little<00:05:40.950> bit

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:41.130 
make it a little bakes it a little bit

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:43.490 
make it a little bakes it a little bit
it<00:05:41.430> really<00:05:41.700> melts<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.420> into<00:05:42.600> the<00:05:42.690> surface<00:05:43.020> of

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
it really melts it into the surface of

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.410 
it really melts it into the surface of
the<00:05:43.710> model<00:05:44.010> wow<00:05:44.160> that's<00:05:44.520> some<00:05:44.760> cool<00:05:44.910> stuff<00:05:45.120> I
