maybe on the outside but just wanted to
give<00:00:33.149> you<00:00:33.300> a<00:00:33.420> little<00:00:33.570> update<00:00:35.149> covered<00:00:36.149> this

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
give you a little update covered this

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.020 
give you a little update covered this
thing<00:00:36.450> with<00:00:36.570> the<00:00:36.660> mulch<00:00:36.870> and<00:00:37.649> then<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
thing with the mulch and then the

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.600 
thing with the mulch and then the
compost<00:00:39.770> and<00:00:40.770> then<00:00:40.950> covered<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.489> with

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
compost and then covered that with

00:00:41.610 --> 00:01:03.640 
compost and then covered that with
woodchips<00:00:42.020> nice<00:00:43.020> thick<00:00:43.230> layer<00:00:43.260> so

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.750 

so<00:01:04.650> that's<00:01:04.830> what<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.070> looks<00:01:05.100> like<00:01:05.369> when<00:01:05.580> it's

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
so that's what it looks like when it's

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.289 
so that's what it looks like when it's
all<00:01:05.880> done<00:01:06.710> it's<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.799> garden<00:01:08.190> off<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:09.240> the

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299

two<00:01:26.040> feet<00:01:26.220> over<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:28.220> maybe<00:01:29.220> two<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.550> a<00:01:29.610> half

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:29.730 
two feet over here maybe two and a half

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.370 
two feet over here maybe two and a half
three<00:01:29.910> feet<00:01:30.000> over<00:01:30.360> there<00:01:32.870> it's<00:01:33.870> nice<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.110> we

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
three feet over there it's nice that we

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.990 
three feet over there it's nice that we
got<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.880> fence<00:01:35.880> has<00:01:36.120> a<00:01:36.150> nice<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.660> break<00:01:38.000> and

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000

then we have that back sighs a nice one
break<00:01:42.300> and<00:01:42.630> then<00:01:42.720> one<00:01:42.900> breaking<00:01:43.110> on<00:01:43.200> this<00:01:43.350> side

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
break and then one breaking on this side

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.610 
break and then one breaking on this side

still growing in there and then about a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.199 
still growing in there and then about a
week<00:02:43.739> ago<00:02:43.980> we<00:02:44.190> planted<00:02:44.340> some<00:02:44.610> seeds<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:45.060> this

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
week ago we planted some seeds in this

00:02:45.209 --> 00:03:12.380 
week ago we planted some seeds in this
fair<00:02:45.480> so<00:03:10.820> strawberries<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.910> think<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.209> want

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
fair so strawberries I think they want

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.020 
fair so strawberries I think they want
to<00:03:12.420> start<00:03:12.630> coming<00:03:12.810> back

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.199 

great<00:03:18.030> binary<00:03:18.510> here<00:03:18.840> let's<00:03:19.739> take<00:03:19.860> it<00:03:20.010> up

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:20.209 
great binary here let's take it up

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:22.470 
great binary here let's take it up
against<00:03:21.209> something<00:03:21.510> and

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
against something and

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.570 
against something and
so<00:03:23.480> every<00:03:23.780> patch<00:03:24.020> looks<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.160> he<00:03:25.280> wants<00:03:25.520> to

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:25.580 
so every patch looks like he wants to

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:31.500 
so every patch looks like he wants to
start<00:03:25.820> waking<00:03:26.090> up<00:03:27.490> tell<00:03:28.490> some<00:03:28.760> spots<00:03:30.190> really

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
start waking up tell some spots really

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.790 
start waking up tell some spots really
open<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.570> get<00:03:32.720> some<00:03:32.870> strawberries<00:03:33.350> this<00:03:33.500> year
