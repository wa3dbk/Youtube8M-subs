 Pepper, spicy chilli and sweet chilli plants are grown in Italy as annuals 

00:00:20.993 --> 00:00:40.993
 the peppers can be planted directly in the house, while for the peppers the small plants are prepared in seed-beds, already in February-March if we have the possibility of sowing in a tempered greenhouse 

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:09.980
 Between the end of April and the middle of May we will have peppers already 5-10 cm high, so we can plant them 

00:02:10.316 --> 00:02:17.320
 The peppers are grown in a good rich and soft soil, well drained, but not excessively sandy, nor too compact 

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:29.060
 The plants are planted at a distance of about 40-50 cm from each other, in a very sunny place, and sheltered from the wind 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.910
 Next to the seedling we place a guardian immediately, so that it develops straight 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:39.260
 Periodically we prune the soil around the plant to avoid the development of infesting grasses and water it abundantly, especially during the hot months and in the absence of rain 

00:03:40.183 --> 00:03:52.180
 When on the plant we notice the presence of 5-7 fruits, we top the upper leaves, so that the plant stops producing new leaves and concentrates its efforts in the development of the fruits
