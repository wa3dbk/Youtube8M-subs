00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:48.859
 ok first 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:56.639
 we connect the computer by USB stick 

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:59.309

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:20.070

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.820
 4 gb 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:02:01.260
 as you can see here you can't use more than 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:06.420
 4 gb to boost even if your 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:08.819
