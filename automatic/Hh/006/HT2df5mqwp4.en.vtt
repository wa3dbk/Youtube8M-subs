 from the area customer experience and me 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.530
 have today the joy you opel onstar 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.660
 we are allowed to introduce in geneva 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 our this is our next step in 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.250
 The direction of the vehicle connectivity 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.810
 and puts it clearly on comfort 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.699
 but especially on security features 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.769
 so that it starts, for example 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.630
 the vehicle diagnosis in advance 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.310
 already can ask that I fall in the case 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.560
 an accident automatically contacted 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 monster would stand us around 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.099
 purposefully wrestle help and 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.750
 Rescuers, however, also sends 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.969
 comfort features like that anytime 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.219
 a navigation address via the 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.100
 Call center can search and there in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.600
 can import a navigation system 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.899
 certainly also in the direction of comfort 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.640
 the wifi hotspot i love 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.750
 a year together with monster 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.520
 can test for free 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.719
 that means I can go up to seven 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.820
 mobile devices over the wlan 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.309
 connect the interface with the vehicle 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.469
 and abroad as well as the service 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.120
 Streaming music etc can use what 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.030
 certainly for the pilgrims also one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.350
 Great comfort education is additional 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.659
 to the east, the user has the opportunity 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.610
 to download the smartphone app 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.470
 This was possible at any time 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.070
 live information on the 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.360

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.170
 to find again 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.549

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:30.680
 Driver safety that means for me 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:31.880

 the ears the place of the vehicle itself 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:14.900

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:16.639
 what a vehicle is now something for 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.919

 submit to the breakdown download service 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.460

 can reach and also the right one 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.310
 tools need case he has 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.350
 berlin ride I have the opera parsifal 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.030

 many thanks to a best for him thanks 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.180
 let us assume another scenario 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.789
 that would be this that I am now 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:42.979
 unfortunately an accident would have been in the case 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:44.300
 automatically the monster call center 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:50.660
 Agent call me and you can now 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:52.190
 Of course, no, it's nothing 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.280
 but I had one 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:05:00.320
 they could help me with an accident 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.930
 yes i can i will pilot the boy 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:05.300
 for progress to the right is now 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.970
 still relatively many curves to the shade 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.729
 roll with the notes 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:12.289
 thanks so much what would happen now 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.720
 is the same again as in the case of a breakdown 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.500
 namely that vehicle information color 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.270
 of the car etc 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:18.949
 everything that helps the rescue 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:20.060
 could really stand by me 

00:05:18.949 --> 00:05:20.990
 as fast as possible and will 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:28.370
 to be prepared 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:32.419
 automatically given up by now 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.889
 the way to the court went on site and me 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:35.270
 think that it is a very exciting thing 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.740
 that you really are not with us 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.900
 is left alone but in the case of 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:41.090
 Accident then really stays the costa 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.500
 the demonstrator actually wise up 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.340
 the rescue workers arrive 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.050
 our circuit 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:46.849
 now take another one last 

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:49.490
 namely the case that I have one 

00:05:46.849 --> 00:05:50.690
 want to find certain special goals and 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:52.310
 I can do it while driving 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.690
 bad my navigation device 

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:55.099
 also in the case one wants as a customer 

00:05:53.690 --> 00:05:55.550
 anytime the blue monster button 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:02.630
 to press 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:03.800
 Here we play by hello me 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.300
 would like a nice one 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.220
 Italian restaurant in the district 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:11.590
 you can find this out for 

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:11.590
 I agreed 

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:28.630
 apologizes 

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:34.070
 can you please give me that in 

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:40.580
 navigation systems download the 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:46.460
 address yes peacefully even no 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:48.409
 Thanks for having lunch after lunch 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:50.919
 Marks end look for 

00:06:48.409 --> 00:06:58.789
 the further construction of a reaction not 

00:06:50.919 --> 00:07:01.849
 good thank you and have nice request 

00:06:58.789 --> 00:07:03.590
 so it certainly is another 

00:07:01.849 --> 00:07:04.960
 exciting application was promised 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:07.370
 founded 

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:09.080
 I'll take that one myself while 

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:10.760
 the ride always has a goal in it 

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.349
 circle or any location of 

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:13.279
 let the monster pick something out 

00:07:12.349 --> 00:07:14.870
 can and there if that 

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:17.000
 navigation systems vehicle available 

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:18.669
 is also directly in the navigation route 

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.840
 can make a program 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:22.340
 now there is also a last or 

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.199
 to say two last cases namely that 

00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:25.099
 One thing would be the topic of data security 

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:27.050
 we take it very seriously 

00:07:25.099 --> 00:07:30.229
 this is up here as in the beginning 

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:31.969
 mentions the private key that I if 

00:07:30.229 --> 00:07:34.159
 I keep you longer with longer press 

00:07:31.969 --> 00:07:35.870
 can turn on the finger so that 

00:07:34.159 --> 00:07:37.300
 Vehicle position data is not there for us 

00:07:35.870 --> 00:07:38.680
 more can be transmitted 

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.780
 That means the driver is always in 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:42.340
 able to say when and in what 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:45.550
 In fact, he does form an exchange with 

00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:47.530
 monster i would like this button 

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:49.659
 keep it pressed for about 5 seconds 

00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.940
 now a misoperation excluded 

00:07:49.659 --> 00:07:54.789
 is 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:56.860
 Hartung fifth inactive so an exact 

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:58.900
 In this case, now would be a temporary 

00:07:56.860 --> 00:08:00.069
 only in case of emergency otherwise no more 

00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.030
 can see where I am right now 

00:08:00.069 --> 00:08:03.030
 actually located
