00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
is a three-and-a-half millimeter is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.190 
is a three-and-a-half millimeter is
basically<00:01:32.250> just<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.549> 90<00:01:32.909> degree<00:01:33.299> adapter<00:01:33.990> and

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
basically just a 90 degree adapter and

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.390 
basically just a 90 degree adapter and
what<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.350> can<00:01:34.439> do<00:01:34.530> is<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.799> put<00:01:34.920> onto<00:01:35.189> your

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
what you can do is you can put onto your

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.420 
what you can do is you can put onto your
headphone<00:01:35.820> splitter<00:01:36.060> like<00:01:36.720> so<00:01:37.070> you<00:01:38.070> need<00:01:38.280> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
headphone splitter like so you need the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.030 
headphone splitter like so you need the
flexible<00:01:38.850> need<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:40.530> then<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.770> you<00:01:40.829> do<00:01:40.950> is

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
flexible need and then what you do is

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.149 
flexible need and then what you do is
you<00:01:41.130> plug<00:01:41.369> in<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:42.119> receiver<00:01:42.590> into<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.799> and

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
you plug in the receiver into that and

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.999 
you plug in the receiver into that and
that<00:01:45.170> basically<00:01:46.170> means<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.649> can<00:01:46.799> have<00:01:46.920> the

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that basically means you can have the

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.230 
that basically means you can have the
receiver<00:01:47.369> plugged<00:01:47.460> into<00:01:47.700> your<00:01:47.759> camera<00:01:48.090> but

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
that's the actual bit that plugs into

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.170 
that's the actual bit that plugs into
your<00:01:49.860> camera<00:01:50.250> which<00:01:50.399> means<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:51.030> you're<00:01:51.149> not

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180

and quite often when I tried using these

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.140

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
so I left me in a bit of a dilemma so

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:35.779 
so I left me in a bit of a dilemma so
I've<00:04:34.500> had<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.680> sort<00:04:34.919> of<00:04:34.979> change<00:04:35.190> the<00:04:35.460> theme<00:04:35.639> of

I've had to sort of change the theme of

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:37.850 
I've had to sort of change the theme of
the<00:04:35.909> video<00:04:36.000> a<00:04:36.180> bit<00:04:36.450> so<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.409> sort<00:04:37.590> of<00:04:37.620> become

the video a bit so it sort of become
this<00:04:37.950> product<00:04:38.340> review<00:04:39.020> so<00:04:40.020> the<00:04:40.229> question<00:04:40.680> is

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
this product review so the question is

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:45.589 
this product review so the question is
is<00:04:41.520> it<00:04:41.849> worth<00:04:42.060> it<00:04:43.130> personally<00:04:44.130> I<00:04:44.430> don't<00:04:45.419> think

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
is it worth it personally I don't think

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:48.260 
is it worth it personally I don't think
so<00:04:46.080> simply<00:04:46.680> because<00:04:47.099> I<00:04:47.370> wouldn't<00:04:47.880> use<00:04:48.090> this

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
so simply because I wouldn't use this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.719 
so simply because I wouldn't use this
the<00:04:48.510> sound<00:04:48.719> quality<00:04:49.229> is<00:04:49.260> too<00:04:49.650> poor<00:04:50.010> the

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
the sound quality is too poor the

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:54.649 
the sound quality is too poor the
hissing<00:04:51.240> and<00:04:51.450> I<00:04:51.990> mean<00:04:52.139> I'm<00:04:52.469> using<00:04:52.740> it<00:04:52.979> now<00:04:53.659> but

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
hissing and I mean I'm using it now but

00:04:54.659 --> 00:04:56.690 
hissing and I mean I'm using it now but
the<00:04:54.750> sound<00:04:54.990> quality<00:04:55.080> is<00:04:55.469> pretty<00:04:55.800> poor<00:04:56.279> is

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:56.700 
the sound quality is pretty poor is

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.610 
the sound quality is pretty poor is
there's<00:04:57.090> a<00:04:57.150> lot<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.419> hissing<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.169> background

00:04:58.610 --> 00:04:58.620 
there's a lot of hissing and background

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.050 
there's a lot of hissing and background
noise<00:04:58.800> going<00:04:59.219> on<00:04:59.340> and<00:04:59.599> I<00:05:00.599> have<00:05:01.080> much<00:05:01.770> better

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
noise going on and I have much better

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.080 
noise going on and I have much better
alternatives<00:05:03.060> that<00:05:04.370> that<00:05:05.370> work<00:05:05.580> better<00:05:05.820> for

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
alternatives that that work better for

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:10.089 
alternatives that that work better for
me<00:05:06.330> personally<00:05:06.950> in<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.909> simplest<00:05:09.389> terms

00:05:10.089 --> 00:05:10.099 
me personally in the simplest terms

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:12.890 
me personally in the simplest terms
optimists<00:05:11.099> think<00:05:11.370> about<00:05:11.669> what<00:05:12.150> they<00:05:12.330> want<00:05:12.570> and

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
optimists think about what they want and

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:19.159 
optimists think about what they want and
how<00:05:12.930> they<00:05:13.409> want<00:05:13.800> it<00:05:14.039> most<00:05:14.820> of<00:05:14.969> the<00:05:15.000> time<00:05:17.659> but<00:05:18.659> my

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
how they want it most of the time but my

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.379 
how they want it most of the time but my
alternatives<00:05:19.860> do<00:05:20.039> involve<00:05:20.430> spending<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.240> lot

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
alternatives do involve spending a lot

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:25.940 
alternatives do involve spending a lot
more<00:05:21.419> money<00:05:21.590> so<00:05:22.590> if<00:05:23.010> you<00:05:23.400> haven't<00:05:23.700> got<00:05:24.950> any

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
more money so if you haven't got any

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.670 
more money so if you haven't got any
alternative<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:27.029> this<00:05:27.240> then<00:05:27.659> this<00:05:28.050> would<00:05:28.380> be

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
alternative to this then this would be

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.860 
alternative to this then this would be
okay<00:05:29.039> as<00:05:29.190> a<00:05:29.279> stopgap<00:05:29.639> until<00:05:29.909> you<00:05:30.419> can<00:05:30.570> sort<00:05:30.779> of

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:30.870 
okay as a stopgap until you can sort of

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:33.550 
okay as a stopgap until you can sort of
save<00:05:31.050> up<00:05:31.229> and<00:05:31.349> get<00:05:31.469> something<00:05:31.710> better<00:05:32.389> but

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
save up and get something better but

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.719 
save up and get something better but
it's<00:05:34.560> really<00:05:34.770> hard<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.250> draw<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.460> conclusion

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
it's really hard to draw a conclusion

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.640 
it's really hard to draw a conclusion
all<00:05:36.210> i<00:05:36.240> can<00:05:36.510> do<00:05:36.659> i<00:05:36.690> think<00:05:37.050> in<00:05:37.200> this<00:05:37.289> video<00:05:37.529> is

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
all i can do i think in this video is

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.110 
all i can do i think in this video is
provide<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.190> with<00:05:38.340> the<00:05:38.430> information<00:05:38.550> that

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
I've found and show you the demo which

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.149 
I've found and show you the demo which
I'm<00:05:41.849> using<00:05:42.090> now<00:05:42.419> and<00:05:42.889> you're<00:05:43.889> going<00:05:44.010> to<00:05:44.070> have

plunge and go for it if you're
interested<00:05:51.090> in<00:05:51.150> my<00:05:51.330> alternatives<00:05:52.050> what<00:05:52.889> I<00:05:52.919> do

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
interested in my alternatives what I do

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:55.550 
interested in my alternatives what I do
is<00:05:53.190> I'll<00:05:53.310> do<00:05:53.460> that<00:05:53.580> in<00:05:53.729> my<00:05:53.849> next<00:05:54.150> how-to<00:05:55.020> video
