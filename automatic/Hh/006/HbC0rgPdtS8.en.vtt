00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
good now before unfortunately I did

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.119 
good now before unfortunately I did
record<00:00:39.239> this<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.750> I<00:00:39.840> did<00:00:40.020> have<00:00:40.200> my<00:00:40.230> own<00:00:40.590> audio

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
record this and I did have my own audio

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.010 
record this and I did have my own audio
going<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.640> it<00:00:41.730> was<00:00:41.760> live<00:00:42.030> but<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:42.540> problem<00:00:42.690> is

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
going and it was live but the problem is

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.650 
going and it was live but the problem is
because<00:00:43.860> it's<00:00:44.190> the<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.309> time<00:00:44.760> I've<00:00:45.329> done

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
because it's the first time I've done

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:47.930 
because it's the first time I've done
live<00:00:45.840> commentaries<00:00:46.289> before<00:00:46.620> it<00:00:46.829> wasn't<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
live commentaries before it wasn't it

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.790 
live commentaries before it wasn't it
didn't<00:00:48.270> work<00:00:48.809> out<00:00:49.020> as<00:00:49.200> good<00:00:49.410> because<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
didn't work out as good because the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600 
didn't work out as good because the
audio<00:00:50.300> the<00:00:51.300> game<00:00:51.480> volume<00:00:51.660> was<00:00:51.989> it<00:00:52.110> like<00:00:52.379> over<00:00:53.340> I

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
audio the game volume was it like over I

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.360 
audio the game volume was it like over I
don't<00:00:54.090> know<00:00:54.289> overlooking<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.379> I<00:00:55.440> guess<00:00:55.680> so<00:00:55.980> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
don't know overlooking it I guess so the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.310 
don't know overlooking it I guess so the
audio<00:00:56.820> was<00:00:57.000> overtaking<00:00:57.629> my<00:00:57.750> voice<00:00:57.960> and<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.260> he

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
audio was overtaking my voice and so he

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.110 
audio was overtaking my voice and so he
couldn't<00:00:58.469> hear<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.739> properly<00:00:58.890> so<00:00:59.340> I'm<00:01:00.000> just

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
couldn't hear it properly so I'm just

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.700 
couldn't hear it properly so I'm just
gonna<00:01:00.239> do<00:01:00.449> this<00:01:00.539> commentary<00:01:00.960> afterwards<00:01:01.500> so
