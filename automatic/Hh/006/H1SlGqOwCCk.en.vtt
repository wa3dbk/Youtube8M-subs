00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.550
 South wagoner is the act of loading they unloaded canavarro 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:13.469
 to make pitches I'm going to take an ordeal it's time he comes back 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.320
 now the pimba itapetinga / forwards 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.230
 and it looks like I work that loaded tons loads 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.230
 the moment he freed him from fighting to the end 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:27.409
 Campo Grande, MS 

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:30.749
 if I take the reel the way it presents itself 

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.380
 in this item that alia 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:37.040
 you can stop here here in October by the movement limited so far to 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.280
 to see 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.010
 to play more than a little further now I'm going to have to get up a lot 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.030
 love her arm 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.660
 and this movement 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.280
 will make me do my partner 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.510
 while having the head in the ear in the nose 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.780
 I do not know where but the great chance of going for a spin 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.860
 how to insure the correct way to secure the vacancy he cites the Portuguese 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.630
 ice cold 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.280
 podilla 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.770
 because it is so and I go chat or not the movement of the pulse 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.220
 because she 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.300
 to the Lord 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.670
 raising and lowering lifting and lowering can carry 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.540
 understand that you observe river 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.540
 he took carrying action and unloaded 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.350
 the pitch must always be made in the net movement continues doing here 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.190
 now 90 degrees over my head 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.190
 after the climber 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.590
 let's pay attention 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.030
 and I can 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.030
 be with an indicator pointing the grÃªmio to play 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.110
 the indicator evaluates 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.820
 Then I'll play thinking about that day on that flank and art after a bridge or 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.820
 other or with the lift laura king 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 and soon this 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.150
 or else 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.080
 I can get it 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.380
 wrap around 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.380
 like the trigger indicator down here 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.080
 there lives below 

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.279
 and also continuous movement 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.779
 I do it too 

00:02:11.779 --> 00:02:12.599
 this is too personal
