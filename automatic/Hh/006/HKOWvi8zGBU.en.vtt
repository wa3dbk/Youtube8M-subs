00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.330
 Welcome to the new technology 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.850
 tutorial 

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.050
 today it's about the biceps with the 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.650
 to train barbell 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.080
 I often see many stories with me 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.360
 swing out the back and so on 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
 and I, I would like today simply times the 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.210
 show correct technique 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.029
 There are no different variants 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.770
 question that is not only this variant 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.570
 I show you it right but it 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.890
 There are many variants of it 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:39.290
 but I'll show you the most important ones 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.700
 Exercise and there are between 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.830
 city â€‹â€‹possibilities out of the once 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:47.710
 possibility of a shoulder width 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:50.030
 to do and start the whole thing like that 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.250
 or you have the possibility that 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.770
 such a failure step is both 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 well, just have to look something for you 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:01:01.600
 end effect makes sense or was me 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:04.100
 Better just feel good with yes 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 It does not matter which positions you are 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:09.619
 have that respect you the puddle bottom 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.930
 just a bit to save the buttocks on 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 brings it to build muscle tension brings 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.440
 so that you upper body with the 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.210
 spine is stable with the hip 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.550
 then you look after the shoulder blades 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.000
 behind and lets the poor hang through 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.890
 should 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.320
 from this position is the 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.200
 basic position you go with the poor 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.890
 upwards without the elbow 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.070
 moved from the place moves that is called the 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.260
 elbow stays on the spot 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.360
 many i show it now where ever 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:43.570
 Avoid negation should make the 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:46.070
 kidney or the one we had 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.860
 It is important that the spine is fixed 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.810
 is the elbow hands and stays 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.510
 really isolated then also from the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.860
 Exercise biceps out if you have to 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:00.799
 the biceps really do work and 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.750
 solve work again and again 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:04.369
 to solve 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.190
 that would have been enough now 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:08.470
 now the variation in 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.800
 School Board wide shoulder stand by 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:15.030
 the back was on tension and tension 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.500
 You see my hip is not moving 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.110
 and my spine is moving too 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.490
 that does not mean everything is just the only one 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 Forearm moves upwards 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:28.450
 short down the maximum contraction 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 hold up in the ventilation 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:43.210
 exhale and inhale 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:45.070
 exhale inhale exhale another one 

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.770
 idea and then we bring along a sentence 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:51.370
 the exercise or training weight up 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.810
 We welcome you right back 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.120
 right now I have an exercise set 

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.040
 my weight selected so that i like that 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.390
 room built between 6 and 15 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:00.250
 can create repetitions 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.500
 that is the repetition 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.810
 area of the muscle so stimulates the 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.270
 you speak in the muscle building area 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.980
 turning hypertrophy so important 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:11.230
 First of all, I give the pole with me 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.980
 box technique on and not nice 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.860
 the reason 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.020
 that means important is the strong one 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.080
 to lift it so be it right after 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.420
 At the top , she says, rod attacks her 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.160
 about shoulder width in the 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.680
 standard variant try it now 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.200
 once the sow is let out beds 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:33.790
 fixed bauhaus tense headmaster 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.080
 are behind and off you go slowly 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:44.010
 Drain controlled exclusively upwards 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:44.010
 and 3 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:04:19.709
 four elbows will stand still 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:04:24.150
 not forward still clean and 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.890
 four kassen technique clean settle well 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.110
 made 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.360
 So again important points either 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.850
 Fail cut or hip flexor stand 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:35.100
 important is pore soil bit reinke 

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:37.080
 relax belly relax that you 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:40.160
 here stability you have that no 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:43.050
 shake it okay then it would be stable 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 stay behind shoulder blades stay 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:47.340
 back down and you're only going 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.900
 isolated with forearm up and 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:54.000
 down is so important that you 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.200
 if you realize you are starting on this 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.740
 upper body to ask 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:05:00.360
 It is a sign that your technique 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.810
 wears off and the weight is too heavy 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.180
 could 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.110
 that means you really have to take care of that 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:09.060
 Pay attention that only minimal tolerances 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.890
 go through otherwise ego 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:12.930
 screw weight a bit 

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:16.110
 reduce and restore with the clean 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:17.550
 technology start at the end effect brings 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:19.290
 there's nothing here when I'm with you 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.820
 with the help of the back one does not have the 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.669
 the work done but the back 

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.330
 and you want to penetrate the biceps 

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.280
 do not engage 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:28.950
 In this sense, I'm looking forward to mine 

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:31.320
 next car to watch from 

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:34.610
 next technique tutorial and we see 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.610
 until then
