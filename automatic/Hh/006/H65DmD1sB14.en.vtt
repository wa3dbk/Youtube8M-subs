 This was your g and there made a brother Gachagachi in the request 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:22.640
 I will introduce you 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:24.590
 This is To little I Lana put a card key if there is a take-out port here in the lever 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.300
 I can see 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.460
 The 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.070
 I can see the axis here 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.210
 There are after here 6 connector 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.500
 I will do something like this 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.050
 First of all 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.090
 No example but 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:44.370
 The product contains a small ramne 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.920
 It does not have if anything put 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:50.570
 There is also no body 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.570
 Put points and sell 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.079
 Person 6 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:55.329
 It was a little taste 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.109
 But this 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:58.109
 Tile parts of 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.100
 Your letter wins 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.909
 this 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.870
 When it is plugged into the floor 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.329
 Enter 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:10.540
 8 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:15.190
 Now turn 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:19.650
 Listen carefully or you have not made a sound 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.650
 Please try to 1 Mega is now relying 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.380
 Sounds about 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:30.440
 In this way card keys are arranged 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:34.480
 The lock is applied mechanism and circumference was was respectively 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.480
 We look at the movement of the curl key 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.130
 Well I made it here 

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.970
 Next is the mechanism 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.070
 eh 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.260
 2 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.260
 At all is because the little decomposition ne 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.680
 eh 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.100
 8 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.510
 Collection is 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.739
 If it is said 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.940
 Inside the house 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.440
 Inside is like this 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:28.750
 This yellow port is 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.860
 There is no need to be stuck on a white tile 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.220
 This variant on the opposite 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:37.060
 Kinda true 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.069
 Because it has a wall 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.569
 I do not want to do this 4 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:44.740
 Once frozen 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.640
 I think I'm impatient Nante Well great numbers to judgment 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:52.780
 At the beginning of such a doctor, the other side 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.530
 Do not get blue 6 and gear stuck 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.530
 6 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.560
 8 Are' 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.560
 The product contains the formula of this pulley 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.720
 It nearing shed I'm unreasonable 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:13.650
 I'm not rail now 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.650
 If you put this 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.569
 It moves like this 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.709
 This guy gets out of the way 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:26.120
 Can go around 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.880
 so 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.260
 Ram is supposed to come out 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.260
 In this wood floors blood 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.870
 Move this again like this 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.490
 Move this 

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.000
 This Uchida 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.440
 Move this like this 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.290
 It also comes in storage here and the lock is locked 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:02.540
 It became such a system 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.540
 Thank you for watching
