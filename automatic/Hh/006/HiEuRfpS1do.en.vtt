the<00:00:21.560> apps<00:00:21.740> behind<00:00:22.220> it<00:00:22.460> are<00:00:22.640> hazed<00:00:23.359> over<00:00:23.990> they

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
the apps behind it are hazed over they

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.679 
the apps behind it are hazed over they
have<00:00:24.560> like<00:00:24.830> a<00:00:24.859> darker<00:00:25.429> tint<00:00:25.730> to<00:00:26.210> them<00:00:26.359> so<00:00:26.599> you

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:26.689 
have like a darker tint to them so you

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:29.290 
have like a darker tint to them so you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
can see right now haze over is working

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.080 
can see right now haze over is working
the<00:00:29.689> Mac<00:00:29.929> App<00:00:30.140> Store<00:00:30.170> app<00:00:30.650> is<00:00:30.980> on<00:00:31.220> top<00:00:31.490> and<00:00:31.789> you

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
the Mac App Store app is on top and you

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.880 
the Mac App Store app is on top and you
can<00:00:32.210> see<00:00:32.360> it's<00:00:32.480> normal<00:00:32.900> but<00:00:33.080> the<00:00:33.200> apps<00:00:33.350> behind

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
can see it's normal but the apps behind

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.120 
can see it's normal but the apps behind
it<00:00:34.100> such<00:00:34.460> as<00:00:34.610> Safari<00:00:34.790> or<00:00:35.180> final<00:00:35.660> cut<00:00:35.690> or<00:00:36.130> tweet

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:37.130 
it such as Safari or final cut or tweet

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.460 
it such as Safari or final cut or tweet
bot<00:00:37.370> there's<00:00:37.850> sort<00:00:38.030> of<00:00:38.120> dimmed<00:00:38.420> out<00:00:38.690> and<00:00:39.050> that

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
bot there's sort of dimmed out and that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.040 
bot there's sort of dimmed out and that
basically<00:00:40.220> reduces<00:00:40.940> the<00:00:41.120> distraction<00:00:41.780> that<00:00:41.990> I

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
basically reduces the distraction that I

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.080 
basically reduces the distraction that I
would<00:00:42.260> have<00:00:42.440> that<00:00:42.620> would<00:00:42.770> take<00:00:42.950> away<00:00:43.280> from<00:00:43.550> the

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:44.090 
would have that would take away from the

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.970 
would have that would take away from the
app<00:00:44.270> running<00:00:44.630> on<00:00:44.750> top<00:00:45.020> which<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.350> the<00:00:45.500> Mac<00:00:45.770> App

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
apps behind it are dim and I'll open up

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.130 
apps behind it are dim and I'll open up
Xcode<00:01:13.060> and<00:01:14.060> you<00:01:14.149> can<00:01:14.270> see<00:01:14.420> those<00:01:14.600> apps<00:01:14.840> are<00:01:14.960> dim

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:15.140 
Xcode and you can see those apps are dim

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.080 
Xcode and you can see those apps are dim
then<00:01:15.380> I<00:01:15.439> open<00:01:15.740> up<00:01:15.890> Final<00:01:16.369> Cut<00:01:16.399> and<00:01:16.700> you<00:01:16.759> can<00:01:16.909> see

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
then I open up Final Cut and you can see

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.270 
then I open up Final Cut and you can see
the<00:01:17.270> apps<00:01:17.450> behind<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.990> are<00:01:18.109> dim<00:01:18.289> so<00:01:18.560> basically

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
the apps behind it are dim so basically

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.099 
the apps behind it are dim so basically
it<00:01:19.490> just<00:01:19.520> makes<00:01:19.939> it<00:01:20.060> so<00:01:20.210> you<00:01:20.270> can<00:01:20.479> easily<00:01:20.840> focus

00:01:21.099 --> 00:01:21.109 
it just makes it so you can easily focus

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:22.810 
it just makes it so you can easily focus
on<00:01:21.469> the<00:01:21.590> app<00:01:21.770> that<00:01:22.100> you're<00:01:22.249> looking<00:01:22.520> at<00:01:22.670> that

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
you can go in and configure first of all

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:42.459 
you can go in and configure first of all
let<00:01:40.909> me<00:01:40.939> just<00:01:40.999> open<00:01:41.359> up<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.689> couple<00:01:42.200> of<00:01:42.289> apps

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:42.469 
let me just open up a couple of apps

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.120 
let me just open up a couple of apps
here<00:01:42.829> just<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.280> we<00:01:43.460> can<00:01:43.670> get<00:01:44.509> this

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
here just so we can get this

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.489 
here just so we can get this
demonstrated<00:01:46.130> here<00:01:46.539> all<00:01:47.539> right<00:01:47.719> so<00:01:47.960> if<00:01:48.139> you<00:01:48.380> go

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
demonstrated here all right so if you go

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.469 
demonstrated here all right so if you go
up<00:01:48.590> to<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.799> menu<00:01:49.069> bar<00:01:49.100> you'll<00:01:49.969> see<00:01:50.179> where<00:01:50.420> it

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:50.479 
up to the menu bar you'll see where it

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.029 
up to the menu bar you'll see where it
has<00:01:50.600> an<00:01:50.749> option<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.109> turn<00:01:51.289> Hayes<00:01:51.590> over<00:01:51.619> off

00:01:52.029 --> 00:01:52.039 
has an option to turn Hayes over off

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:54.370 
has an option to turn Hayes over off
like<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:52.999> then<00:01:53.569> you<00:01:53.659> just<00:01:53.869> get<00:01:53.960> normal

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
like this and then you just get normal

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.660 
like this and then you just get normal
mode

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
mode

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.719 
mode
and<00:01:56.000> turn<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:56.330> back<00:01:56.450> on<00:01:56.720> and<00:01:57.620> focus<00:01:58.130> mode<00:01:58.370> and

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
and turn it back on and focus mode and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:01.360 
and turn it back on and focus mode and
then<00:01:59.360> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.600> change<00:01:59.900> the<00:02:00.229> amounts<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.950> dim

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
then you can change the amounts of dim

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.700 
then you can change the amounts of dim
so<00:02:01.970> you<00:02:02.030> can<00:02:02.479> turn<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.840> dim<00:02:03.020> pretty<00:02:03.440> much<00:02:03.560> all

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
so you can turn the dim pretty much all

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:05.050 
so you can turn the dim pretty much all
the<00:02:03.800> way<00:02:03.890> down<00:02:04.130> or<00:02:04.400> you<00:02:04.490> can<00:02:04.520> turn<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.880> all<00:02:05.030> the

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
the way down or you can turn it all the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.850 
the way down or you can turn it all the
way<00:02:05.180> up<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.630> then<00:02:06.050> everything<00:02:06.440> else<00:02:06.680> looks

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
way up and then everything else looks

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.430 
way up and then everything else looks
almost<00:02:07.010> black<00:02:07.479> so<00:02:08.479> you<00:02:08.539> really<00:02:09.020> can<00:02:09.170> focus

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
almost black so you really can focus

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.559 
almost black so you really can focus
like<00:02:10.100> that<00:02:10.369> but<00:02:10.610> I<00:02:10.640> think<00:02:10.759> that's<00:02:11.060> a<00:02:11.180> little<00:02:11.420> on

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
like that but I think that's a little on

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.060 
like that but I think that's a little on
the<00:02:11.690> extreme<00:02:12.080> side<00:02:12.290> so<00:02:12.560> what<00:02:12.680> we're<00:02:12.800> gonna<00:02:12.890> do

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
the extreme side so what we're gonna do

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.100 
the extreme side so what we're gonna do
is<00:02:13.190> just<00:02:13.220> turn<00:02:13.550> this<00:02:13.700> back<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.180> about<00:02:14.420> this

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
is just turn this back to about this

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.140 
is just turn this back to about this
right<00:02:15.410> here<00:02:15.770> how<00:02:16.370> about<00:02:16.430> that<00:02:16.730> that<00:02:17.000> looks

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
right here how about that that looks

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.540 
right here how about that that looks
