00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.119
 as we can see in the images 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.220
 both outside and inside the 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.820
 nissan pulsar has the nissan adn 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.739
 you have your reference we can make it to 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.250
 the boomerang that there is in the outside 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.230
 so much for example in the leds 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.620
 the lakes that offer the lights 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.110
 front with a clear subject of 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.330
 nissan adn and the way of vee in the 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.340
 central grill these rise as well 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.989
 we found them in the back in 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.230
 the back of the vehicle with 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.940
 details such as the finishes 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.370
 in the lower back part of the 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.900
 vehicle with carbon finishes that give 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.900
 a sportier character to the vehicle 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.770
 in driving out the most efficient engines and 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.490
 they have a good balance between 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.820
 efficiency 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.220
 in the engine response we launch the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.630
 vehicle with three ranges of engines one 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.670
 Diesel engine range of 1.5 dci of 110 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.369
 horses which gives you some 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.770
 consumptions of 36 liters 100 kilometers and 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.830
 a volume of emissions of 94 grams 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:37.470
 then we go to the range to the range 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:42.689
 gasoline the petrol range which from 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:45.720
 today the 1.2 turbo with 115 ig 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.750
 horses with a consumption of 5 liters 100 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.479
 kilometers and 117 grams of emissions more 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.520
 forward after 23 months of 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.860
 launch we introduce the range 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.560
 1.2 gasoline with our version 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.100
 xtronic instead of manual or automatic 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.709
 and finally in the early middle of 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:08.399
 Next year we introduced our 1.6 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.549
 of igt also turbo that delivers 190 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.549
 horses 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.870
 the pulsar as well you can appreciate the 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.010
 enter is a vehicle that they offer 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.050
 comfort 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.019
 higher than the average this is thanks 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.580
 to the great room to the great space that 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.650
 offers both in the front rows 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.989
 like the back rows 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 the steering wheel also offers something very 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.090
 characteristic of the nissan range that is 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.489
 the same design for all the 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.970
 recently released qashqai and 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:39.970
 extremes 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.280
 here we have this wavy shape of the 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.900
 that can be seen in the console 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.360
 through the center console they're going 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.650
 up to the doors which gives an image 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:55.940
 more of amplitude also it is necessary to emphasize 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.519
 the internal harmonization of the vehicle 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.410
 the different details that the 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:04.000
 different colors everything has a meaning 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.000
 and tone has is well harmonize 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.689
 we have a 5 inch screen in 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.030
 color which offers a very easy 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:14.219
 interaction between the driver and also 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.319
 gives us the information of 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.239
 browser with which the client does not 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.579
 you have to separate the view from the 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:24.950
 road but simply a small 

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.950
 glance already has the guide ready 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.299
 Hello
