this<00:01:39.119> this<00:01:39.329> world<00:01:39.570> being<00:01:39.810> being<00:01:40.140> big

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
this this world being being big

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
this this world being being big
obviously<00:01:40.860> a<00:01:40.920> lot<00:01:41.009> larger<00:01:41.250> than<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.670> asylum

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
obviously a lot larger than the asylum

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
obviously a lot larger than the asylum
that<00:01:42.210> we're<00:01:42.329> used<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:43.140> terms<00:01:43.380> of

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
that we're used to in terms of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.499 
that we're used to in terms of
navigating<00:01:44.040> that<00:01:44.220> world<00:01:44.490> how<00:01:45.090> does<00:01:45.210> Batman

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
navigating that world how does Batman

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:46.550 
navigating that world how does Batman
actually<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:45.869> around<00:01:46.049> as<00:01:46.170> a<00:01:46.200> grant<00:01:46.439> that

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
actually get around as a grant that

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.980 
actually get around as a grant that
Batman<00:01:46.950> is<00:01:46.979> it<00:01:47.220> stealing<00:01:47.430> cars<00:01:47.700> or<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.420> mean<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
Batman is it stealing cars or I mean the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.389 
Batman is it stealing cars or I mean the
great<00:01:49.140> thing<00:01:49.439> I<00:01:49.680> think<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.950> is<00:01:50.009> one<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.220> my

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
great thing I think this is one of my

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:51.889 
great thing I think this is one of my
favorite<00:01:50.759> feature<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.240> whole<00:01:51.420> game<00:01:51.659> is

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
favorite feature to the whole game is

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.050 
favorite feature to the whole game is
the<00:01:52.020> navigation<00:01:52.590> system<00:01:52.619> so<00:01:53.250> taking<00:01:53.970> the

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
the navigation system so taking the

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.179 
the navigation system so taking the
fight<00:01:54.240> into<00:01:54.540> Arkham<00:01:54.899> City<00:01:55.110> it's<00:01:55.740> a<00:01:55.799> much<00:01:55.979> more

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
fight into Arkham City it's a much more

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.130 
fight into Arkham City it's a much more
vertical<00:01:56.700> space<00:01:56.969> tonight<00:01:57.570> we<00:01:57.689> really<00:01:57.960> wanted

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
vertical space tonight we really wanted

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.200 
vertical space tonight we really wanted
to<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.469> was<00:01:59.070> introduce<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.640> how<00:01:59.790> does<00:01:59.909> Batman

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
to do was introduce like how does Batman

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.399 
to do was introduce like how does Batman
get<00:02:00.360> around<00:02:00.570> gough<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.930> wanted<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.259> answer

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
get around gough and we wanted to answer

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.670 
get around gough and we wanted to answer
that<00:02:01.649> question<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:02.369> light<00:02:03.119> escapes<00:02:03.680> just

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
that question so light escapes just

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.770 
that question so light escapes just
clapping<00:02:05.369> up<00:02:05.460> smoking<00:02:05.790> out<00:02:05.939> in<00:02:06.030> there<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:06.689> we

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
clapping up smoking out in there so we

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.779 
clapping up smoking out in there so we
use<00:02:06.930> this<00:02:07.079> for<00:02:07.350> momentum<00:02:07.770> gliding<00:02:08.220> system<00:02:08.610> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
use this for momentum gliding system so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.520 
use this for momentum gliding system so
basically<00:02:09.149> as<00:02:09.209> you're<00:02:09.330> gliding<00:02:09.509> now<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> can

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
basically as you're gliding now you can

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.800 
basically as you're gliding now you can
I<00:02:10.560> form<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.190> use<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:11.819> momentum<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.420> glide<00:02:12.630> up

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
I form and use that momentum to glide up

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.570 
I form and use that momentum to glide up
and<00:02:13.050> through<00:02:13.230> the<00:02:13.380> city<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.040> then<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.430> can

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
and through the city and then you can

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.340 
and through the city and then you can
grapple<00:02:14.790> boost<00:02:15.180> off<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> top<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:15.810> building<00:02:16.200> so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
grapple boost off the top of building so

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.380 
grapple boost off the top of building so
when<00:02:16.470> you<00:02:16.590> grapple<00:02:17.010> you<00:02:17.520> double<00:02:17.850> tap<00:02:18.000> and<00:02:18.240> hold

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
when you grapple you double tap and hold

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.750 
when you grapple you double tap and hold
a<00:02:18.630> and<00:02:19.020> it<00:02:19.110> fires<00:02:19.410> Batman<00:02:19.860> up<00:02:20.069> off<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.430> top<00:02:20.580> of

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
a and it fires Batman up off the top of

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.670 
a and it fires Batman up off the top of
buildings<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.750> when<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.050> get<00:02:22.200> really<00:02:22.380> good<00:02:22.620> at

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
buildings so when you get really good at

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.320 
buildings so when you get really good at
this<00:02:22.800> you<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.520> glide<00:02:23.700> across<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.150> whole<00:02:24.300> of

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
this you can glide across the whole of

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.910 
this you can glide across the whole of
Arkham<00:02:24.780> City<00:02:24.900> without<00:02:25.110> even<00:02:25.590> touching<00:02:25.740> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
Arkham City without even touching the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.430 
Arkham City without even touching the
ground<00:02:26.069> that's<00:02:26.600> decking<00:02:27.600> not<00:02:27.900> showing<00:02:28.319> that

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
ground that's decking not showing that

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.410 
ground that's decking not showing that
we<00:02:28.530> really<00:02:28.860> really<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.489> know<00:02:29.610> worked<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.239> lot

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
we really really you know worked a lot

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.479 
we really really you know worked a lot
on<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:31.080> key<00:02:31.230> thing<00:02:31.470> you're<00:02:31.620> doing<00:02:31.650> we<00:02:32.100> waste

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
on the key thing you're doing we waste

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.130 
on the key thing you're doing we waste
hours<00:02:32.970> doing<00:02:33.150> it<00:02:33.300> in<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.420> office<00:02:33.600> where<00:02:33.989> we're

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
hours doing it in the office where we're

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.780 
hours doing it in the office where we're
just<00:02:34.170> messing<00:02:34.470> around<00:02:34.680> gliding<00:02:35.430> through<00:02:35.459> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
just messing around gliding through the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.820 
just messing around gliding through the

Artemis o goddess alright fine i will go
for<00:02:47.220> it<00:02:47.250> in<00:02:47.550> the<00:02:47.670> last<00:02:47.820> game<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:48.120> spent<00:02:48.300> a<00:02:48.330> lot

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
for it in the last game we spent a lot

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.449 
for it in the last game we spent a lot
of<00:02:48.480> time<00:02:48.570> in<00:02:48.780> detective<00:02:49.200> mode<00:02:49.230> which<00:02:50.220> you<00:02:50.370> know

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
of time in detective mode which you know

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.830 
of time in detective mode which you know
it<00:02:50.640> was<00:02:50.820> good<00:02:50.970> gameplay<00:02:51.300> but<00:02:51.360> a<00:02:51.510> lot<00:02:51.660> of<00:02:51.690> times

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
it was good gameplay but a lot of times

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:52.910 
it was good gameplay but a lot of times
i<00:02:51.900> think<00:02:52.050> if<00:02:52.110> they<00:02:52.200> pulled<00:02:52.410> away<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.620> little<00:02:52.830> bit

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
i think if they pulled away a little bit

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.860 
i think if they pulled away a little bit
from<00:02:53.190> the<00:02:53.220> look<00:02:53.489> the<00:02:53.940> graphical<00:02:54.390> of<00:02:54.480> aesthetic

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
from the look the graphical of aesthetic

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.080 
from the look the graphical of aesthetic
of<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.050> game<00:02:55.350> has<00:02:56.040> detective<00:02:56.430> boat<00:02:56.550> changed

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
of the game has detective boat changed

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:58.699 
of the game has detective boat changed
at<00:02:57.300> all<00:02:57.420> in<00:02:57.600> this<00:02:57.690> one<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.230> what<00:02:58.380> we've<00:02:58.500> done<00:02:58.530> is

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
at all in this one so what we've done is

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.199 
at all in this one so what we've done is
a<00:02:58.860> jess<00:02:59.430> was<00:02:59.580> just<00:02:59.730> doing<00:02:59.940> some<00:03:00.120> detective

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
a jess was just doing some detective

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.990 
a jess was just doing some detective
mode<00:03:00.750> there<00:03:01.019> we've<00:03:01.410> kind<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.800> tunes<00:03:02.459> detective

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.430 
chaps beat them down and hunts them so
we<00:03:20.610> make<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:20.910> world<00:03:21.150> slightly<00:03:22.019> less<00:03:22.170> readable

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
we make the world slightly less readable

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.590 
we make the world slightly less readable
but<00:03:23.280> we<00:03:23.430> made<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.700> characters<00:03:23.880> pop<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.360> lot

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
but we made the characters pop a lot

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.060 
but we made the characters pop a lot
more<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.110> when<00:03:25.230> you<00:03:25.320> switch<00:03:25.530> into<00:03:25.709> that<00:03:25.829> mode

more so when you switch into that mode

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:27.440 
more so when you switch into that mode
