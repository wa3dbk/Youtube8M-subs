00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:02.870
 Hello dear let's say 

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:05.370
 the master with you has become a strong new hand 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.160
 new video name 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.810
 I received a lot of letters 

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.780
 how to express the bride and at the same time save 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.310
 transparency facts 

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.150
 and 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.039
 items are paying 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.689
 and finally one of the subscribers sent 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.199
 I have a wonderful photo 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:23.890
 where I can demonstrate 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.349
 this effect 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.759
 for starters sent the bride to see 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.840
 as you can see I have already done it 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.689
 Now I will tell you how 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.830
 I singled out and using experiment first 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.680
 creating working contour 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.399
 after this click 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:39.550
 right click 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.820
 the educational team won 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.990
 region local government day 2 

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.339
 like this 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:49.289
 Tatyana pathetic he immediately to copy 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.240
 this money is already on a new layer 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.520
 you can do exactly the same if 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.659
 apply some 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:00:58.499
 any of the main familiar ways 

00:00:58.499 --> 00:00:59.590
 allotment 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.200
 so the bride we have allocated 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.239
 Now we face the challenge to 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 through translucent fabrics with a3 began to beat 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.340
 inform what form in the first place I 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.440
 chose a background 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.110
 so contrasting 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.350
 branches blooming against a bright blue background 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.720
 the sky 

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.840
 on zhku less our opinion that 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:24.729
 now 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.140
 we need to achieve effect through 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.200
 fact we saw 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.530
 and families flowering branches 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.530
 in this photo through the stream 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.290
 we do not see particularly bright colors for example 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.180
 green or bright and at the lawyer 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.370
 but if your photo 

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.070
 there is something bright you take the instrument 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.330
 they say bye 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.100
 is set 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.090
 the size of brush you need 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.090
 if you set lower saturation 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:57.870
 and let's say 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.060
 there is a man behind the bride 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.060
 or a picture or something else 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.000
 you just spend this tool on 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.709
 fighters 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:11.349
 and reduce saturation 

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:13.480
 see if we spend rose 

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.729
 reduced color saturation 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.689
 the same thing is done with the veil here this 

00:02:19.689 --> 00:02:21.990
 effect for almost not see because 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.209
 but then there is no bright 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.819
 from this country and here you can already 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:28.880
 notice that 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.699
 veil stop 

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:33.269
 no brown tellers 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.619
 that's how we handle 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:37.829
 all fatum 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.359
 tool sponge 

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:41.819
 Further 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:43.759
 and as you see, I have a very very 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.759
 dark I need to lighten it 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:49.049
 as we usually brightens 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:49.919
 photograph 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.939
 of course using levels or curves 

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:55.389
 for this using fast masks i 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.269
 will highlight 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:59.590
 sort of plots the facts that require to 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.139
 shrines 

00:03:01.139 --> 00:03:03.489
 set to faster mask mode 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.019
 will switch 

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:07.739
 to black environment as the main 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.739
 take a brush 

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:14.339
 or process the fact 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:16.369
 as you can see, I created such a rough 

00:03:16.369 --> 00:03:18.750
 offices that I climbed 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:19.760
 to extreme 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.019
 nothing terrible because there is no 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.689
 pixels so there is nothing to influence 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:26.220
 but here from try 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.810
 be careful about him and do it because 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:31.620
 when we will apply the settings 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.079
 lightening 

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.299
 in will be rules rough edges 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.490
 noticeable 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:38.440
 dark and light areas of the poet 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.260
 do your best 

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.839
 make the selection softer 

00:03:41.839 --> 00:03:44.409
 and shade it well 

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:47.669
 now go to normal 

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.669
 indicative selection shift counter and 

00:03:51.249 --> 00:03:52.230
 push 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.620
 that in the department we only have to 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:55.789
 patent 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:57.269
 and right away 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.869
 kontrol real 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.439
 call the window with levels 

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.829
 and start 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:05.829
 lighten our fatum 

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:12.729
 still above this mean then we need it 

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:16.129
 to remove 

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:17.979
 and look what happened 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:19.949
 snow white fact 

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:22.379
 yes we press the peak he takes a long time 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:24.610
 branch 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.840
 like because she loved 

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.210
 everything seems to be fine oh why do we have everything 

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.689
 does not shine through these strings 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:32.879
 for this 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:34.879
 we will need to apply 

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:36.930
 ordinary plastic 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:38.470
 with opacity 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:39.250
 ten 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.870
 percent 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.889
 take the soft brush itself soft 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:48.029
 choose the size yourself 

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:50.210
 and now 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.770
 we will sell 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.770
 transparency want 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:05.770
 now look what is starting here 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.770
 manifest 

00:05:10.309 --> 00:05:13.309
 girl's explanation 

00:05:14.749 --> 00:05:17.490
 and the factor remains in place 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.259
 but already with a translucent 

00:05:19.259 --> 00:05:21.849
 effect 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.219
 take a look 

00:05:24.219 --> 00:05:26.199
 photo astana perfectly 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.180
 transparent 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.080
 and we now see behind it 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.499
 wonderful spring background 

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.809
 in order for the bride to shine 

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:35.510
 more 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.430
 I 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:38.500
 duplicate snow layer is worth 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:39.730
 applied him 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.600
 filter 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.460
 blur and believed that 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.330
 with such a large radius 

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.240
 changed 

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.900
 light overlap mode 

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:51.150
 and reduced a little opacity 

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.289
 as you can see she has become more 

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:54.580
 and bright 

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:56.449
 and air 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:05:57.790
 thereafter 

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.870
 I switched to the main layer 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:01.150
 make a tool 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:04.409
 retinuous clarifier 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:07.269
 small exposure and walked through her 

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:10.719
 wonderful diodes and everything he could so that he 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:13.059
 sparkled even more 

00:06:13.059 --> 00:06:15.439
 and the last details here we have left 

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:16.199
 places 

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.599
 if you can write something 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.999
 for example, start with a victory 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:23.460
 so in this video, the lessons you knew 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.900
 how to highlight the bride move her to 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.870
 another foundation 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.870
 and at the same time preserve the transparency of the facts 

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:32.639
 we used at the same time 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:34.900
 for our main goal is only two 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.419
 tool from early May using 

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:39.659
 tool bubka 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:41.919
 whether everything is discolored 

00:06:41.919 --> 00:06:43.469
 veil 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.939
 then 

00:06:44.939 --> 00:06:47.849
 in my case I dawn the plot 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:50.429
 veils because they were not for me eternal 

00:06:50.429 --> 00:06:53.789
 dark and then plastic 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.270
 with an opacity of 10 percent 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.470
 we passed the rescuers to make her 

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.240
 transparent 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.779
 as always everything is very simple 

00:07:03.779 --> 00:07:05.960
 I hope Mauro was useful to you 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.910
 and now the processing of wedding photos 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.740
 would give you even more experience close 

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.440
 yes soon meetings next 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.310
