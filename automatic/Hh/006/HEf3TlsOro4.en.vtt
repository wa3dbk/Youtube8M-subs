Robin<00:00:00.930> difficult<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.439> know<00:00:01.560> where<00:00:01.800> to<00:00:01.829> start

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
Robin difficult to know where to start

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:03.889 
Robin difficult to know where to start
really<00:00:02.490> but<00:00:02.669> what's<00:00:03.240> your<00:00:03.330> reaction<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.780> that

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
really but what's your reaction to that

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.650 
really but what's your reaction to that
different<00:00:04.440> here<00:00:04.560> today

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
different here today

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.680 
different here today
I<00:00:06.770> think<00:00:07.770> it's<00:00:07.940> unless<00:00:08.940> result<00:00:09.269> if<00:00:09.480> you<00:00:09.510> look

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
I think it's unless result if you look

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.589 
I think it's unless result if you look
at<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.870> game<00:00:10.019> sounds<00:00:11.010> crazy<00:00:11.309> maybe<00:00:11.700> but<00:00:12.030> it<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
at the game sounds crazy maybe but it is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.709 
at the game sounds crazy maybe but it is
when<00:00:13.230> he<00:00:13.320> was<00:00:13.469> much<00:00:13.830> better<00:00:14.070> than<00:00:14.250> us<00:00:14.540> so<00:00:15.540> we

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
when he was much better than us so we

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.490 
when he was much better than us so we
have<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:15.870> deal<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.109> that<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:17.240> look<00:00:18.240> for<00:00:19.109> for

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
get in a situation where they can they

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.460

that's<00:00:31.679> where<00:00:35.450> the<00:00:36.450> free<00:00:36.780> one<00:00:36.989> result<00:00:37.380> and<00:00:37.530> I

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
that's where the free one result and I

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.510 
that's where the free one result and I
felt<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.820> if<00:00:39.000> he<00:00:39.149> had<00:00:39.239> taken<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.530> yeah<00:00:41.309> one

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
felt that if he had taken that yeah one

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.250 
felt that if he had taken that yeah one
of<00:00:41.610> them<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:42.149> would<00:00:42.450> have<00:00:42.629> been<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.930> different

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
of them that would have been a different

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.139 
of them that would have been a different
game<00:00:43.410> but<00:00:43.440> it's<00:00:44.250> always<00:00:44.430> ifs<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.329> buts<00:00:47.030> if<00:00:48.030> you

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
game but it's always ifs and buts if you

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.930 
game but it's always ifs and buts if you
look<00:00:48.300> at<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.510> facts<00:00:48.809> it's<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.820> simply<00:00:50.820> not

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
look at the facts it's just simply not

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.000 
look at the facts it's just simply not
good<00:00:51.090> enough<00:00:51.120> when<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:51.989> was<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.260> better<00:00:52.559> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
good enough when it was much better and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.369 
good enough when it was much better and
they<00:00:53.610> punished<00:00:53.969> us<00:00:54.120> hard<00:00:54.420> and<00:00:54.920> yeah<00:00:57.170> we<00:00:58.170> can't

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
it's to nil quite quickly yes later it

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.039 
it's to nil quite quickly yes later it
was<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.530> nil<00:01:25.740> and<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.850> gutters<00:01:27.060> about<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.630> I

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
was to nil and the gutters about that I

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.780 
was to nil and the gutters about that I
was<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.530> was<00:01:28.650> quite<00:01:28.890> confident<00:01:29.280> before<00:01:29.490> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
was I was quite confident before the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.899 
was I was quite confident before the
been<00:01:30.270> about<00:01:31.140> my<00:01:31.290> corner<00:01:31.710> but<00:01:32.400> he<00:01:32.520> saved<00:01:32.759> it

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909

been about my corner but he saved it
well<00:01:33.119> I<00:01:33.150> think<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.570> was<00:01:33.689> okay<00:01:34.409> taking<00:01:34.680> penalty

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:35.930 
well I think it was okay taking penalty

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:38.840 
well I think it was okay taking penalty
good<00:01:36.930> safe<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.470> those<00:01:38.220> things<00:01:38.400> happen<00:01:38.610> you

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
good safe and those things happen you

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.020 
good safe and those things happen you
know<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:40.619> best<00:01:40.860> play<00:01:41.040> is<00:01:41.189> mr.<00:01:41.490> monatti<00:01:41.729> once

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
know the best play is mr. monatti once

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.940 
know the best play is mr. monatti once
unfortunately<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:43.649> my<00:01:43.799> turn<00:01:43.890> today<00:01:45.950> yeah

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
unfortunately it was my turn today yeah

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.469 
unfortunately it was my turn today yeah
there<00:01:47.310> was<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> bit<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> turning<00:01:48.149> point<00:01:48.299> as

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
there was a bit of a turning point as

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.740 
there was a bit of a turning point as
well<00:01:48.659> because<00:01:49.049> if<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.070> had<00:01:50.670> gone<00:01:50.850> in<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
well because if that one had gone in it

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.530 
well because if that one had gone in it
one<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.340> maybe<00:01:53.340> a<00:01:53.490> different<00:01:53.820> game<00:01:53.970> again

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
one one maybe a different game again

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.660 
one one maybe a different game again
this<00:01:54.750> maybe<00:01:54.960> if<00:01:55.409> she<00:01:55.680> never<00:01:55.799> know<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.640> was

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
this maybe if she never know it was

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.520 
this maybe if she never know it was
eight<00:01:56.969> nine<00:01:57.210> players<00:01:57.450> out<00:01:57.750> today<00:01:58.140> was<00:01:58.350> there<00:01:58.500> a

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
eight nine players out today was there a

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.010 
eight nine players out today was there a
sense<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:58.829> wasn't<00:01:59.280> quite<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.729> real<00:02:00.149> answer

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
sense that wasn't quite the real answer

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.020 
sense that wasn't quite the real answer
so<00:02:01.560> if<00:02:01.710> eight<00:02:02.100> or<00:02:02.310> nine<00:02:02.460> players<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.000> there

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
so if eight or nine players out there

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.700 
so if eight or nine players out there
suspension<00:02:03.630> or<00:02:03.720> injury<00:02:04.020> today<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.560> there<00:02:04.649> a

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
suspension or injury today was there a

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.469 
suspension or injury today was there a
sense<00:02:04.890> that<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.369> wasn't<00:02:05.640> quite<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.240> real

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
sense that that wasn't quite the real

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.690 
sense that that wasn't quite the real
Alstom<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.079> there<00:02:07.350> today<00:02:07.649> and<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.979> will<00:02:08.489> get

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
Alstom out there today and you will get

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.820 
Alstom out there today and you will get
stronger<00:02:08.910> it's<00:02:09.390> not<00:02:09.539> an<00:02:09.630> excuse<00:02:10.020> because<00:02:10.590> they

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
stronger it's not an excuse because they

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.800 
stronger it's not an excuse because they
had<00:02:10.950> players<00:02:11.220> out<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.610> well<00:02:13.700> so<00:02:14.700> no<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.239> don't

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
had players out as well so no I don't

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.960 
had players out as well so no I don't
think<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.110> we<00:02:16.230> can<00:02:16.349> hide<00:02:16.620> behind<00:02:17.280> injuries

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
think that we can hide behind injuries

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.080 
think that we can hide behind injuries
or<00:02:18.269> suspensions<00:02:19.400> this<00:02:20.400> is<00:02:20.519> what<00:02:20.700> happens<00:02:20.970> in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
or suspensions this is what happens in

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.410 
or suspensions this is what happens in
football<00:02:21.709> everyone<00:02:22.709> knows<00:02:22.920> that<00:02:23.420> injuries

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
football everyone knows that injuries

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.630 
football everyone knows that injuries
happen<00:02:24.720> in<00:02:24.870> football<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.640> suspensions

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
happen in football and suspensions

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.370 
happen in football and suspensions
happen<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.090> football<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.720> you<00:02:27.750> can't<00:02:28.140> hide

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
happen in football so you can't hide

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.860 
happen in football so you can't hide
behind<00:02:28.410> that<00:02:28.890> no<00:02:29.099> no<00:02:29.370> no<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:30.269> was<00:02:30.420> our

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
behind that no no no this was our

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.970 
behind that no no no this was our
strongest<00:02:31.650> team<00:02:31.920> today<00:02:32.340> and<00:02:33.680> we<00:02:34.680> gave<00:02:34.799> our

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
strongest team today and we gave our

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.800 
strongest team today and we gave our
maximum<00:02:35.370> but<00:02:35.549> it<00:02:35.850> was<00:02:36.000> clearly<00:02:36.239> not<00:02:36.360> good

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
maximum but it was clearly not good

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.190 
maximum but it was clearly not good
enough<00:02:36.989> can<00:02:37.920> also<00:02:38.069> come<00:02:38.280> back<00:02:38.430> from<00:02:38.549> this<00:02:39.200> well

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
enough can also come back from this well

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.870 
enough can also come back from this well
