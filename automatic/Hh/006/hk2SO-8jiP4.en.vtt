00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:33.199 
universe one solution of course would be

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:34.960 
universe one solution of course would be
to<00:04:33.319> use<00:04:33.560> a<00:04:33.590> third-party<00:04:33.949> application<00:04:34.849> that's

why whatsapp was worth so much money to

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:41.760 
why whatsapp was worth so much money to
Facebook<00:04:39.229> when<00:04:39.380> it<00:04:39.470> bought<00:04:39.650> it<00:04:39.680> because<00:04:40.250> this

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
Facebook when it bought it because this

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:44.379 
Facebook when it bought it because this
application<00:04:42.770> was<00:04:43.310> used<00:04:43.490> by<00:04:43.610> millions<00:04:44.270> around

00:04:44.379 --> 00:04:44.389 
application was used by millions around

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:45.939 
application was used by millions around
the<00:04:44.630> rest<00:04:44.810> of<00:04:44.900> the<00:04:44.960> world<00:04:45.110> where<00:04:45.289> SMS<00:04:45.650> hadn't

the rest of the world where SMS hadn't
taken<00:04:46.069> off<00:04:46.340> yet<00:04:46.610> or<00:04:47.180> it<00:04:47.389> was<00:04:47.509> too<00:04:47.660> expensive

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
taken off yet or it was too expensive

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.879

Alaina<00:05:31.610> she<00:05:31.909> has<00:05:32.090> an<00:05:32.210> Apple<00:05:32.479> device<00:05:32.690> we'll

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
Alaina she has an Apple device we'll

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.909 
Alaina she has an Apple device we'll
just<00:05:33.050> send<00:05:33.169> it<00:05:33.289> there<00:05:35.620> but<00:05:36.620> that's<00:05:36.710> the

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:36.919 
just send it there but that's the

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:39.010 
just send it there but that's the
problem<00:05:37.159> is<00:05:37.490> you<00:05:38.330> know<00:05:38.419> you<00:05:38.479> have<00:05:38.690> to<00:05:38.810> have<00:05:38.930> an

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
problem is you know you have to have an

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:40.719 
problem is you know you have to have an
Apple<00:05:39.259> device<00:05:39.560> I<00:05:39.889> think<00:05:40.340> it's<00:05:40.460> a<00:05:40.520> step

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:40.729 
Apple device I think it's a step

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:42.520 
Apple device I think it's a step
backwards<00:05:41.180> I<00:05:41.360> think<00:05:41.810> it's<00:05:41.900> really<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.169> shame

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
backwards I think it's really a shame

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.149 
backwards I think it's really a shame
because<00:05:44.229> that's<00:05:45.229> not<00:05:45.409> the<00:05:45.560> promise<00:05:45.830> of

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
because that's not the promise of

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.999 
because that's not the promise of
computing<00:05:46.729> the<00:05:46.820> promise<00:05:47.120> of<00:05:47.210> computing<00:05:47.780> is

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:48.009 
computing the promise of computing is

00:05:48.009 --> 00:05:52.629 
computing the promise of computing is
open<00:05:49.780> transparent<00:05:50.780> easy<00:05:51.020> communication<00:05:51.650> not

00:05:52.629 --> 00:05:52.639 
open transparent easy communication not

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:54.610 
open transparent easy communication not
well<00:05:53.180> I<00:05:53.210> can<00:05:53.479> only<00:05:53.509> talk<00:05:53.840> to<00:05:53.870> people<00:05:54.020> in<00:05:54.469> my

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
well I can only talk to people in my

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.570 
well I can only talk to people in my
group<00:05:55.090> that's<00:05:56.090> what<00:05:56.300> we<00:05:56.389> used<00:05:56.599> to<00:05:56.719> have<00:05:57.580> of

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
group that's what we used to have of

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.300 
group that's what we used to have of
course<00:05:58.639> it's<00:05:58.909> good<00:05:59.030> for<00:05:59.210> Apple<00:05:59.479> right<00:06:00.409> because

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:01.310 
course it's good for Apple right because

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:02.860 
course it's good for Apple right because
then<00:06:01.699> you're<00:06:01.940> more<00:06:02.210> likely<00:06:02.270> to<00:06:02.539> buy<00:06:02.659> an<00:06:02.750> iPhone

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
then you're more likely to buy an iPhone

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.080 
then you're more likely to buy an iPhone
