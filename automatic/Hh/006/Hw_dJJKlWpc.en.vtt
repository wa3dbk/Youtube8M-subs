00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.500
 Gamers Review: NBA 2K15 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.500
 Sports games seem to be aimed at 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:36.460
 to really advance little over the years. Between delivery and delivery, they imply 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.120
 that their main mission is to improve only what is necessary to keep up to date. Although, 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.100
 has a series that has worked not to overcome its weak competence and its delivery 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.790
 previous, if not all sports games. Without so much cartel outside the United States, 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:59.790
 plus much prestige among the critics, comes NBA 2K15. 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:07.610
 Visual Concepts has been a key piece in understanding the offshore sports games 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.690
 of its history. They were responsible of the first Madden and has known to give to the saga 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.119
 NBA 2K characteristic details that have been imitated in recent years by sagas of more 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:25.320
 fame. For example, the spectacular television-style presentation of recent 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.790
 now this gift in the middle of sports titles. 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.460
 Therefore, NBA 2K15 arrives as a title from which many new things are expected due 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:44.409
 to its focus on the new generation. At the outset, we have controls that leave the gameplay as 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:51.369
 agile as the sport requires. The passes, dribbles and other movements are fast and the actions 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.170
 respond appropriately to controls. This detail, which seems to be bound, 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.079
 is the main reason why the game has made a difference in recent years. 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:07.320
 As the main addition to basic gameplay, mid-distance shots count 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.930
 with a marker that tells you the precise moment you should drop the shot to make basket. 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.400
 The distance, marking and skill of the athlete will determine how wide the range is. 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.870
 It is a detail that gives a new flavor to this title, showing that changes can be made 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.260
 without modifying the fundamentals of gameplay. 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.260
 If you think that to defend, just chase whoever takes the ball, let me tell you 

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:42.819
 that is not the case. When you lose the ball, the game will show you the options 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:48.379
 so you can establish your defense in a better thought-out way. Like this, 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.819
 more than pushing buttons, the game features a strategic component that recreates the essence 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.099
 of the sport. The game is spectacular. Graphically 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.510
 very well done and the animations run in a more realistic way than in any other 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:10.690
 sports game In addition, they will further enhance the presentation details. Right, 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:16.160
 still far from achieving the realism of other titles, but does not ask much in 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.690
 quality with large productions. That yes, there are players whose modeling is not 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.930
 so well done and times when the animations do not flow as well as they should, more inclusive 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:34.930
 thus they are superior to normal. There are modes of games such as the career or 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:53.099
 general manager. At first you built the story of your athlete in the NBA, in the second 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.150
 you are responsible for everything that has to do with the management and performance of the team 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:03.879
 generally. They are very good game modes, but they are not 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:10.330
 as deep as we'd like and are filled with nauseous moments as the dialogues. 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:17.330
 You can edit with certain depth to your character and even details like the sneakers. 

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:24.849
 With the opportunity even to play in street form, both online and locally, 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.409
 the basketball experience takes on a little intensity. 

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:35.409
 NBA 2K15 is not a perfect game. Plus of course it's the best sports game these days. 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.969
 It is understood that because, although it is not the best seller in the world, it leads 

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:48.379
 the way in which the titles of the genre are made by several companies. If you are 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:55.379
 basketball fan, or want a good experience, do not doubt that this is the game to follow. 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.600
 I'm Alexandra Vicencio and I'm a fan of Michael Jordan. I even think that I can fly, that 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.500
 Well, I can touch the sky. we play 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.000
