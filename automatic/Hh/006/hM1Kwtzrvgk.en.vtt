00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
the good thing about the harmonica is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.890 
the good thing about the harmonica is
that<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.699> don't<00:00:17.880> necessarily<00:00:18.090> need<00:00:18.570> to<00:00:18.630> know

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
that you don't necessarily need to know

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.760 
that you don't necessarily need to know
how<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.140> read

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
how to read

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.880 
how to read
traditional<00:00:20.460> music<00:00:21.029> on<00:00:21.390> a<00:00:21.420> score<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:22.590> be<00:00:22.710> able

to play it a long time ago someone came

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.830 
to play it a long time ago someone came
up<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.609> this<00:00:26.730> really<00:00:26.880> good<00:00:27.060> idea<00:00:27.119> of<00:00:27.449> how<00:00:27.779> to

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
up with this really good idea of how to

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.339 
up with this really good idea of how to
chart<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.619> music<00:00:29.160> that<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.689> specifically

chart out music that is specifically

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.310 
chart out music that is specifically
designed<00:00:31.560> for<00:00:32.009> playing<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> harmonica<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.450> I

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
designed for playing the harmonica and I

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.430 
designed for playing the harmonica and I
have<00:00:34.739> a<00:00:34.770> picture<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.340> here<00:00:35.750> basically<00:00:36.750> if

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
have a picture of it here basically if

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.799 
have a picture of it here basically if
you<00:00:37.860> see<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:38.100> number<00:00:38.370> in<00:00:38.670> harmonica<00:00:39.270> tablature

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
you see a number in harmonica tablature

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
you see a number in harmonica tablature
that<00:00:40.020> doesn't<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.980> circle<00:00:41.309> around<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.700> it

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that doesn't have a circle around it it

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.520 
that doesn't have a circle around it it
means<00:00:41.969> that<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.660> breathing<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.079> on<00:00:43.350> that

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
means that you are breathing out on that

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.400 
means that you are breathing out on that
number<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.030> harmonica<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.110> number

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
number and on the harmonica it's number

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.830 
number and on the harmonica it's number
one<00:00:46.590> through<00:00:46.829> 10<00:00:47.070> on<00:00:47.250> the<00:00:47.340> holes<00:00:47.550> so<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:48.090> kind

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
one through 10 on the holes so you kind

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.720 
one through 10 on the holes so you kind
of<00:00:48.899> go<00:00:49.020> by<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:50.010> there's<00:00:50.460> a<00:00:50.550> number

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
of go by that and if there's a number

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.549 
of go by that and if there's a number
with<00:00:50.969> a<00:00:51.000> circle<00:00:51.719> around<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.110> that<00:00:52.289> means<00:00:52.410> you

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with a circle around it that means you

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.040 
with a circle around it that means you
breathe<00:00:52.739> in<00:00:52.920> the<00:00:53.190> picture<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> one<00:00:54.210> that's

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
breathe in the picture of the one that's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.889 
breathe in the picture of the one that's
with<00:00:55.980> no<00:00:56.010> circle<00:00:56.520> that's<00:00:56.670> breathing<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
with no circle that's breathing out on

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.150 
with no circle that's breathing out on
hole<00:00:58.079> number<00:00:58.109> one<00:00:58.469> with<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.920> circle

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
hole number one with the circle

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.240 
hole number one with the circle
breathing<00:00:59.760> in<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.030> hole<00:01:00.180> number<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:01.250> so

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
breathing in on hole number one so

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.660 
breathing in on hole number one so
basically<00:01:02.760> you<00:01:03.120> take<00:01:03.329> this<00:01:04.049> code<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.400> apply

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
basically you take this code and apply

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.210 
basically you take this code and apply
it<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.180> different<00:01:06.420> songs<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.040> find

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
it to different songs and you can find

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.390 
it to different songs and you can find
these<00:01:08.310> online<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.689> harmonica<00:01:10.260> books<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
these online and in harmonica books and

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.580 
these online and in harmonica books and
here's<00:01:11.970> an<00:01:12.060> example<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.510> I<00:01:12.810> charted<00:01:13.229> out<00:01:13.350> of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
here's an example that I charted out of

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.429 
here's an example that I charted out of
mary<00:01:14.580> had<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.790> little<00:01:14.850> lamb<00:01:15.180> just<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.750> simple

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439

mary had a little lamb just a simple
song<00:01:16.650> but<00:01:16.950> all<00:01:17.159> written<00:01:17.909> out<00:01:18.090> in<00:01:18.119> harmonica

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
song but all written out in harmonica

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.450 
song but all written out in harmonica
tablature<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.650> I'll<00:01:19.830> play<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.070> for<00:01:20.189> you<00:01:20.250> right

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460

so--that's<00:01:41.490> harmonica<00:01:41.970> tablature<00:01:42.510> and<00:01:43.020> next

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
so--that's harmonica tablature and next

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
so--that's harmonica tablature and next
I'm<00:01:43.380> going<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.530> talk<00:01:43.740> about<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.580> new<00:01:45.090> technique

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I'm going to talk about a new technique

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.000 
I'm going to talk about a new technique
on<00:01:45.630> the<00:01:45.690> harmonica<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.350> slightly

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
on the harmonica that's slightly

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.910 
on the harmonica that's slightly
advanced<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.750> but<00:01:48.750> it's<00:01:48.900> a<00:01:48.990> lot<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.140> fun<00:01:49.410> once

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
advanced and but it's a lot of fun once

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.080 
advanced and but it's a lot of fun once
you<00:01:49.980> get<00:01:50.130> it<00:01:50.280> down<00:01:50.400> and<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:50.850> called

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
you get it down and that's called

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.160 
you get it down and that's called
bending<00:01:51.300> and<00:01:51.630> that's<00:01:51.810> what<00:01:51.900> I'm<00:01:51.960> going<00:01:52.080> to

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
bending and that's what I'm going to

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.660 
bending and that's what I'm going to
talk<00:01:52.320> about<00:01:52.410> next<00:01:52.650> to<00:01:53.040> watch<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.490> other
