00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.010
 haiku and welcome greetings 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 make you the ultimate witch master 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:20.820
 survival macro yes the whole thing 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:24.570
 ultimately use imperium pvp 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.500
 Therefore, I would like to be quite flexible 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.150
 say with a few little ones 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.920
 restrictions also for everything becks 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.750
 here, too, with a few 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.759
 small restrictions 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.159
 It does indeed infirmity ex-champions to 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:38.429
 I have later list is 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.109
 and yes, just six times is breaking 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:42.690
 small advantage on me but then 

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.010
 Coming back soon 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.870
 Let's take a look at the talent 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 Distribution to which I have chosen and 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.729
 Although dark regeneration animal-1 talent 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.979
 extremely important 30 life points in the 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:55.969
 Course of 12 seconds and the cure 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.139
 is increased by 25 in this period 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:01.619
 of course that's just a fat one 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:03.239
 bush and animal 3 and animal 15 next 

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.190
 important talents see connections and 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.930
 tremor of the sacrifice of one or the other 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.580
 hey why will that be tremor the think 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.620
 Sacrifice us if I am 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 think victim to the classical sense 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.850
 connection ok crashed right away 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.340
 however, we first jump to the glyph 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.200
 that would be there as a taste folder 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.460
 health stone and emma is the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 really a must-have because we like that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.170
 be full quickly that ten seconds 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.510
 the skin ultimately lasts from gs 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.280
 not at all come to bear 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.320
 and of course all of that after his 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.990
 gusto we would like to distribute 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.760
 and yes, I'll come to the talent first 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.470
 Distribution what I already mentioned 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:41.160
 Gregory had a connection to the sacrifice 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.840
 with singing connection you can in 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.810
 optimally found empty transducer complain 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.090
 if you do not interrupt cast it must 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.000
 you offer an extra 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.150
 server is resp 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.390
 many titles will be shown soon you 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.640
 You see, my hit point is about 360,000 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.560
 and yes I just wanted it 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.300
 sacrifice the demon and half of the 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.870
 life points of my demon 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.119
 have passed to me that is 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.100
 432,000 life points which is game-wise 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:14.700
 by threshing six anyway 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:16.800
 Master with sacrifice and victim and play 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.170
 is is of course in many fight 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.140
 makes sense to sacrifice the educational converter 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.720
 simply because we still have a strong one 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:27.510
 yes the cool down hate that would be shadow 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.160
 Bulwark rifle the teacher 20 seconds 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.970
 long 30 percent of its maximum 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.070
 health means you have one last 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.500
 battle critical you actually have one 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.910
 last fight 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.130
 and yes the hippies will be over again 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.360
 apathetic increased among many auxiliaries of 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.070
 witch masters like for example 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.100
 health stone or sinister 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.870
 Regeneration depends on the hit number 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.810
 that is the fairy tale padding all the more 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.640
 bigger ones will be kept too 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.170
 From percentage broke is natural 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.320
 however, the salary is the same 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.490
 of course, it's just too high 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.260
 your favor 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.000
 I'm going to now still in 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.940
 make healthy stone and then 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.770
 I also come right to the macro best 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.170
 I would not have called it here 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:14.930
 foot call cast sinister regeneration that 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.160
 means we have the hot of dark ones 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:21.150
 regeneration equal from the beginning of 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:23.310
 on it and also the 25 raises the 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.020
 durability of us afterwards 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.550
 health rise to the second skin 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:31.320
 to apply so we have two 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:34.050
 Wood hoarded magically times and is 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.000
 so that the optimal start yes next 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:37.709
 sessions masterly healing potion that 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.020
 must think about whether you middle first 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.880
 in random commits, for example, is very 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:45.000
 Highly recommended because the drinks cost 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:48.630
 not really much and we raise because 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.860
 here just apathetic in the turn pure 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.780
 For example, you have to go 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.850
 decide to use the healing potion or 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:57.030
 prefer to use tps drank like eg like 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.430
 snake because you can both in one 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.550
 Therefore, you can do that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.989
 maybe take out for pva in arenas 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:06.620
 it does not work with that anyway 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:09.090
 healing potion data can be taken from therefore 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.670
 can you let us stand and 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:13.690
 simply not used is so from then 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.420
 whether that stops or triggers 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:18.430
 18 kaarst bloodsucker is frail 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.830
 ex-master exclusive now at least 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.190
 tell brand to count the fire heals 

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:26.470
 Bloodsucker just sank closer 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.260
 and that's why we want that, of course 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:31.300
 take it with you and use it too 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.820
 only thing to criticize here net verma 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.590
 it is the companion ability 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:38.830
 Shadow powder is given in the global 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:41.070
 cooler triggered and so yes separately 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.330
 must be triggered with a hot key 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:46.840
 and I would have a second time 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:49.750
 pretty vein and leave it pretty empty 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.690
 is the other scania above are dps and 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.210
 down the hps it means yes you can 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:58.000
 Of course, look at the hps 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.410
 funny probably already on the dps 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.780
 rather less but that's what it's all about 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.220
 I will not really start either 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.830
 right now the macro with shadow 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:07.660
 bulwark and then just with my macro 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.730
 who has just shown himself and yes 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.950
 I hope you told me already made fun 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.350
 I very much fun at the demonstration 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.000
 And of course, I like to thumb it up 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:20.070
 I would be happy to enact or one 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.070
 comment and we hear
