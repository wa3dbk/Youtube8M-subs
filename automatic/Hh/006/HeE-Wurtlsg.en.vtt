00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:03.069
 because 

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:05.089
 5 

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:08.089
 all 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.849
 I was part 

00:00:13.279 --> 00:00:16.509
 O 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:19.169
 these commemorative girls 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.349
 Easter Christmas 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:24.769
 are important to such humanity in general 

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:33.109
 Spiritists do not celebrate Easter in this commercial sense in this sense 

00:00:33.109 --> 00:00:34.610
 human 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.770
 with regard to marking is the same situation 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:45.280
 we must remember that long before we speak in exchange for gifts in the 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.479
 presence of Santa Claus 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:49.920
 the presidency told musafir 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.120
 ugly or sharing a supper 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.210
 puccinelli 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.559
 really important is a pity if the moment of birth has changed 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:01.660
 Jesus 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.570
 doctrine that governs 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.440
 these teachings 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.240
 so the spirit is always a lot of respect 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:16.070
 She treats Christmas even though it's a date that's agreed to be marked 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.110
 there in the calendar with red letters 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.860
 is a practice and that we as we mention but what we have to 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 I will have 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.970
 is or is not the country's cement. 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.980
 and how many of us forget about this Christmas day 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.890
 if we take thought and do are appreciable is making birthday 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.040
 We forgot to exchange gifts. We were worried about the table with the house. 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.740
 It's two minutes and inside. 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.120
 and often 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.609
 we are in the southern glue we are feeding stores 

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:52.859
 and it does not fit 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:55.859
 with such a beautiful date so birth of Jesus 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.790
 sto 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:00.800
 I did test
