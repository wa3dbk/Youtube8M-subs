00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 now we are as we are today 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.820
 I bring a weeks code tutorial 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.540
 3 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:13.240
 and good guys, then without further delay 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.530
 let's start because you know that in 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.110
 this game can make you say that 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:20.400
 you do not believe you stay and what 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.400
 you will see until now 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.660
 the wing scoop is to aim and 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:31.029
 shoot that does not give time to the rival neither 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.739
 to shoot you have to aim the most 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.730
 possible fast and as soon as the 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.730
 look, shoot 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.649
 the hard scout is to click 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.120
 scout while you run this is much more 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.589
 difficult and if you want to do a montage 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.589
 it is much more professional 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.510
 the james code is a variant of the quick 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.890
 it's like very complicated to do and almost nothing 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.890
 of being accomplished 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.300
 this is a drastic is to shoot 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.670
 to the right or to the left while 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.380
 targeted and drop the mines quickly 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.210
 Many people are confused that this is a 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.800
 quick scope and if someone tells you to 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.250
 does a little copy of that is that we 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.250
 will give facts 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.700
 the word itself indicates what it is like 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.890
 you can observe is shooting without aiming 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.270
 this is very difficult to do but if 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.050
 get is the truth that you stay like a 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.050
 fucking pro 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.700
 as its own name indicates heart is 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.049
 do a quit cop running as this is 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.049
 the same but without aiming 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.060
 and last but not least the 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.710
 stitch of a lifetime this consists of 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.689
 point to the door until 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.689
 someone come and spread the bullets 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.720
 so nothing here my tutorial is over 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.980
 by chris cobb has not been fast enough 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.060
 and quite summarized I hope that I have 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.580
 served and good to note that there is no 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.040
 there are more people in the video because this 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.420
 apply it online is pretty 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.730
 complicated and I will try to do it and 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.050
 bring it but not events that you give with 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.050
 this is quite theoretical 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.160
 Well, it's here I come now 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.160
 vivaldi but with more feeling well 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.030
 and here 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.550
