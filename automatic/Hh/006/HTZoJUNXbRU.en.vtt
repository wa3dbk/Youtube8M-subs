00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:24.759 
the last couple weeks but again the idea

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.199 
the last couple weeks but again the idea
here<00:01:25.420> is<00:01:25.450> to<00:01:25.569> show<00:01:25.720> you<00:01:25.929> my<00:01:26.800> first<00:01:27.220> look<00:01:27.910> with

here is to show you my first look with

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.330 
here is to show you my first look with
this<00:01:28.360> case<00:01:28.630> and<00:01:28.929> then<00:01:29.319> seeing<00:01:29.679> how<00:01:29.920> well<00:01:30.160> it

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
this case and then seeing how well it

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.010 
this case and then seeing how well it
actually<00:01:30.369> holds<00:01:30.819> up<00:01:31.090> when<00:01:31.330> you<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.599> crammed

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
actually holds up when you just crammed

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.410 
actually holds up when you just crammed
items<00:01:32.470> in<00:01:32.649> when<00:01:33.490> you<00:01:33.580> pack<00:01:33.789> stuff<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:34.179> a<00:01:34.240> hurry

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
items in when you pack stuff in a hurry

items in when you pack stuff in a hurry
which<00:01:34.630> is<00:01:34.750> typically<00:01:35.080> what<00:01:35.170> I<00:01:35.319> do<00:01:36.179> now<00:01:37.179> most

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
which is typically what I do now most

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.469 
which is typically what I do now most
luggage<00:01:38.649> carry-on<00:01:39.069> luggage<00:01:39.099> has<00:01:39.610> the<00:01:40.179> zipper

luggage carry-on luggage has the zipper
in<00:01:40.539> the<00:01:40.569> back<00:01:40.810> so<00:01:41.020> you<00:01:41.050> can<00:01:41.170> take<00:01:41.289> a<00:01:41.440> peek<00:01:41.679> at

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
in the back so you can take a peek at

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.290 
in the back so you can take a peek at
the<00:01:41.920> skeletal<00:01:42.340> system<00:01:42.490> though<00:01:42.789> this<00:01:42.940> is<00:01:43.090> made

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
the skeletal system though this is made

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.469 
the skeletal system though this is made
of<00:01:43.509> an<00:01:44.050> aircraft<00:01:44.319> grade<00:01:45.039> quality<00:01:45.910> aluminum<00:01:46.360> so

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
of an aircraft grade quality aluminum so

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:47.999 
of an aircraft grade quality aluminum so
again<00:01:46.780> this<00:01:46.959> is<00:01:47.080> nice<00:01:47.259> and<00:01:47.440> solid<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:47.830> isn't

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:48.009 
again this is nice and solid this isn't

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.889 
again this is nice and solid this isn't
going<00:01:48.130> to<00:01:48.190> break<00:01:48.459> is<00:01:48.729> it<00:01:49.149> going<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.330> fall<00:01:49.539> apart

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
going to break is it going to fall apart

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.139 
going to break is it going to fall apart
so<00:01:50.050> that's<00:01:50.800> something<00:01:51.069> to<00:01:51.250> keep<00:01:51.429> in<00:01:51.610> mind<00:01:51.880> too

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
so that's something to keep in mind too

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:54.480 
so that's something to keep in mind too
because<00:01:52.569> I've<00:01:52.929> bought<00:01:53.319> lesser<00:01:53.770> luggage<00:01:54.190> and

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
because I've bought lesser luggage and

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.219 
because I've bought lesser luggage and
that's<00:01:54.940> always<00:01:55.240> been<00:01:55.539> an<00:01:55.630> issue<00:01:55.720> because<00:01:56.080> it's

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
that's always been an issue because it's

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.830 
that's always been an issue because it's
an<00:01:56.530> aluminum<00:01:56.800> not<00:01:57.190> in<00:01:57.459> this<00:01:57.640> case<00:01:57.910> now<00:01:58.780> the

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
an aluminum not in this case now the

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600 
an aluminum not in this case now the
bottom<00:01:59.229> here<00:01:59.530> this<00:01:59.920> is<00:02:00.099> a<00:02:00.130> neat<00:02:00.369> feature

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
bottom here this is a neat feature

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.609 
bottom here this is a neat feature
because<00:02:01.119> this<00:02:01.270> is<00:02:01.569> what<00:02:01.810> helps<00:02:02.050> it<00:02:02.289> collapse

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
because this is what helps it collapse

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.740 
because this is what helps it collapse
and<00:02:02.890> then<00:02:02.979> get<00:02:03.700> itself<00:02:03.970> set<00:02:04.300> up<00:02:04.420> for<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:04.720> to

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
and then get itself set up for you to

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.529 
and then get itself set up for you to
pack<00:02:05.020> your<00:02:05.050> luggage<00:02:05.349> it<00:02:05.709> has<00:02:06.130> a<00:02:06.160> base<00:02:06.459> that<00:02:07.149> you

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
pack your luggage it has a base that you

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.809 
pack your luggage it has a base that you
push<00:02:07.810> down<00:02:07.840> and<00:02:08.289> then<00:02:08.800> it<00:02:08.890> has<00:02:09.099> these<00:02:09.340> clasps

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 
push down and then it has these clasps

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.170 
push down and then it has these clasps
that<00:02:10.179> you<00:02:10.660> buckle<00:02:10.929> on<00:02:11.430> so<00:02:12.430> they<00:02:12.610> snap<00:02:13.000> into

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
that you buckle on so they snap into

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.510 
that you buckle on so they snap into
place<00:02:13.450> there's<00:02:13.720> a<00:02:13.780> little<00:02:14.050> bit<00:02:14.140> of<00:02:14.230> tension

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
place there's a little bit of tension

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.890 
place there's a little bit of tension
when<00:02:15.520> you<00:02:15.610> do<00:02:15.790> this<00:02:15.940> but<00:02:16.180> not<00:02:16.330> enough<00:02:16.690> to<00:02:16.810> be

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
when you do this but not enough to be

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.870 
when you do this but not enough to be
annoying<00:02:17.200> and<00:02:17.530> certainly<00:02:18.250> it<00:02:18.400> does<00:02:18.580> make<00:02:18.760> you

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
annoying and certainly it does make you

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.339 
annoying and certainly it does make you
feel<00:02:19.060> good<00:02:19.300> that<00:02:19.360> it's<00:02:19.660> going<00:02:19.750> to<00:02:19.810> last<00:02:20.050> it's

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:20.349 
feel good that it's going to last it's

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.440 
feel good that it's going to last it's
going<00:02:20.470> to<00:02:20.530> stay<00:02:20.920> in<00:02:21.010> place<00:02:21.160> I<00:02:21.489> have<00:02:21.879> no<00:02:22.150> worries

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
going to stay in place I have no worries

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.330 
going to stay in place I have no worries
that<00:02:22.900> are<00:02:23.140> thoughts<00:02:23.620> that<00:02:23.799> it<00:02:23.950> would<00:02:24.129> come

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
that are thoughts that it would come

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.670 
that are thoughts that it would come
loose<00:02:24.579> because<00:02:24.790> it's<00:02:25.180> a<00:02:25.269> real<00:02:25.480> tight<00:02:25.750> fit

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
loose because it's a real tight fit

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.720 
loose because it's a real tight fit
which<00:02:26.980> is<00:02:27.159> really<00:02:27.310> what<00:02:27.519> you

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
which is really what you

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.460 
which is really what you
especially<00:02:28.420> since<00:02:28.599> that's<00:02:28.840> your<00:02:29.019> base<00:02:29.200> and

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
especially since that's your base and

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.559 
especially since that's your base and
that<00:02:30.010> kind<00:02:30.280> of<00:02:30.340> helps<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:31.000> whole<00:02:31.269> luggage

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
that kind of helps this whole luggage

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.080 
that kind of helps this whole luggage
this<00:02:32.230> carry-on<00:02:32.680> piece<00:02:32.709> fills<00:02:33.190> out<00:02:33.370> so<00:02:33.970> again

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.090 
this carry-on piece fills out so again

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:35.789 
this carry-on piece fills out so again
the<00:02:34.450> pockets<00:02:34.900> this<00:02:34.989> is<00:02:35.140> the<00:02:35.200> interior<00:02:35.530> pocket

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:35.799 
the pockets this is the interior pocket

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:37.740 
the pockets this is the interior pocket
nice<00:02:35.950> and<00:02:36.159> deep<00:02:36.310> so<00:02:36.519> you<00:02:36.610> can<00:02:36.849> cram<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.150> lot<00:02:37.599> of

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
nice and deep so you can cram a lot of

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:40.170 
nice and deep so you can cram a lot of
stuff<00:02:37.989> in<00:02:38.200> here<00:02:38.260> so<00:02:39.220> I'm<00:02:39.519> going<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.760> do<00:02:39.909> just

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
stuff in here so I'm going to do just

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.030 
stuff in here so I'm going to do just
that<00:02:40.360> and<00:02:40.599> we'll<00:02:41.080> see<00:02:41.110> how<00:02:41.470> well<00:02:41.709> this

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
that and we'll see how well this

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.940 
that and we'll see how well this
suitcase<00:02:42.340> holds<00:02:43.330> up<00:02:43.510> now<00:02:44.230> that's<00:02:44.680> another

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
suitcase holds up now that's another

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.130 
suitcase holds up now that's another
good<00:02:45.190> look<00:02:45.400> at<00:02:45.580> the<00:02:45.730> quality<00:02:46.510> of<00:02:46.540> the<00:02:46.629> material

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
good look at the quality of the material

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.809 
good look at the quality of the material
again<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.410> think<00:02:47.590> it's<00:02:47.890> really<00:02:48.099> nice<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.549> don't

00:02:48.809 --> 00:02:48.819 
again I think it's really nice I don't

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.610 
again I think it's really nice I don't
think<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.209> camera<00:02:49.390> does<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:49.780> justice<00:02:50.140> there

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
think the camera does it justice there

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.860 
think the camera does it justice there
is<00:02:50.650> a<00:02:50.769> handle<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:51.370> there<00:02:51.940> are<00:02:52.090> feet<00:02:52.390> so<00:02:52.660> in<00:02:52.780> the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
is a handle and there are feet so in the

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.660 
is a handle and there are feet so in the
event<00:02:53.019> that<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.410> don't<00:02:53.590> want<00:02:53.739> to<00:02:53.799> roll<00:02:54.069> you

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
event that you don't want to roll you

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.949 
event that you don't want to roll you
can<00:02:54.790> actually<00:02:54.970> use<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.480> by<00:02:55.569> the<00:02:55.629> handle

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
can actually use it by the handle

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:58.020 
can actually use it by the handle
carrier<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.440> way<00:02:56.650> although<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:57.610> not<00:02:57.760> my

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
carrier that way although that's not my

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.880 
carrier that way although that's not my
preferred<00:02:58.390> choice<00:02:58.659> it's<00:02:59.170> certainly<00:02:59.500> nice<00:02:59.650> to

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
preferred choice it's certainly nice to

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.369 
preferred choice it's certainly nice to
have<00:03:00.040> that<00:03:00.220> option<00:03:00.459> so<00:03:01.170> typically<00:03:02.170> I<00:03:02.200> don't

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:02.379 
have that option so typically I don't

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:04.080 
have that option so typically I don't
use<00:03:02.650> a<00:03:02.680> toiletry<00:03:03.099> bag<00:03:03.280> I<00:03:03.489> typically<00:03:03.970> use

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
use a toiletry bag I typically use

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:07.110 
use a toiletry bag I typically use
ziplock<00:03:04.750> bags<00:03:05.280> it's<00:03:06.280> a<00:03:06.400> better<00:03:06.579> way<00:03:06.760> for<00:03:07.000> me<00:03:07.090> to

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
ziplock bags it's a better way for me to

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.360 
ziplock bags it's a better way for me to
keep<00:03:07.390> things<00:03:07.599> organized<00:03:08.109> so<00:03:08.799> here's<00:03:09.129> kind<00:03:09.220> of

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
keep things organized so here's kind of

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.460 
keep things organized so here's kind of
a<00:03:09.489> sample<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.239> stuff<00:03:10.720> and<00:03:11.049> I'm<00:03:11.109> just<00:03:11.260> going<00:03:11.410> to

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
a sample of stuff and I'm just going to

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.800 
a sample of stuff and I'm just going to
cram<00:03:11.859> it<00:03:12.010> into<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.970> front<00:03:13.299> pocket<00:03:13.510> now

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
cram it into this front pocket now

about<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.650> much<00:04:56.890> stuff<00:04:57.220> in<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.850> I've<00:04:58.210> not

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
about that much stuff in and I've not

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:59.550 
about that much stuff in and I've not
been<00:04:58.450> able<00:04:58.690> to<00:04:58.780> get<00:04:58.930> it<00:04:59.020> zipped<00:04:59.290> without

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
been able to get it zipped without

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.610 
been able to get it zipped without
repacking<00:05:00.220> it<00:05:00.400> or<00:05:00.670> taking<00:05:01.510> things<00:05:01.720> out<00:05:01.960> so<00:05:02.590> I

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
repacking it or taking things out so I

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.170 
repacking it or taking things out so I
was<00:05:02.920> very<00:05:03.130> curious<00:05:03.430> to<00:05:03.580> see<00:05:03.670> how<00:05:03.940> well<00:05:04.150> it

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:04.180 
was very curious to see how well it

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:06.360 
was very curious to see how well it
worked<00:05:04.420> now<00:05:04.720> this<00:05:05.080> works<00:05:05.380> well<00:05:05.680> and<00:05:05.980> I<00:05:06.040> think

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
worked now this works well and I think

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.460 
worked now this works well and I think
is<00:05:06.670> primarily<00:05:07.060> because<00:05:07.510> of<00:05:07.960> the<00:05:08.260> type<00:05:08.440> of

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:08.470 
is primarily because of the type of

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.620 
is primarily because of the type of
material<00:05:08.680> that<00:05:09.190> it<00:05:09.280> just<00:05:09.460> seems<00:05:09.670> to<00:05:09.850> give<00:05:10.090> it

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:10.630 
material that it just seems to give it

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:12.180 
material that it just seems to give it
looks<00:05:10.990> as<00:05:11.110> though<00:05:11.140> I'm<00:05:11.290> struggling<00:05:11.680> that's

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
looks as though I'm struggling that's

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:13.770 
looks as though I'm struggling that's
because<00:05:12.640> I<00:05:12.760> kind<00:05:12.970> of<00:05:13.030> snag<00:05:13.270> a<00:05:13.300> little<00:05:13.630> bit

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
because I kind of snag a little bit

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.050 
because I kind of snag a little bit
there<00:05:14.020> and<00:05:14.200> once<00:05:14.890> I<00:05:15.010> learned<00:05:15.250> how<00:05:15.430> the<00:05:15.490> zipper

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
there and once I learned how the zipper

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.880 
there and once I learned how the zipper
system<00:05:16.210> worked<00:05:16.690> and<00:05:16.870> did<00:05:17.440> it<00:05:17.530> the<00:05:17.590> right<00:05:17.740> way

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:17.890 
system worked and did it the right way

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:20.310 
system worked and did it the right way
I'm<00:05:18.130> in<00:05:18.310> business<00:05:18.520> so<00:05:19.300> again<00:05:19.630> this<00:05:20.020> thing

kudos to Leopold for LuPone to create a

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.900 
kudos to Leopold for LuPone to create a
suitcase<00:05:29.470> that<00:05:29.650> collapses<00:05:30.220> basically<00:05:30.700> into

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
suitcase that collapses basically into

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:32.880 
suitcase that collapses basically into
nothing<00:05:31.330> but<00:05:31.870> you<00:05:32.020> can<00:05:32.050> cram<00:05:32.530> it<00:05:32.650> full<00:05:32.680> of

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
nothing but you can cram it full of

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.010 
nothing but you can cram it full of
stuff<00:05:33.190> obviously<00:05:34.120> the<00:05:34.240> roller<00:05:34.450> system<00:05:34.660> works

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
stuff obviously the roller system works

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.530 
stuff obviously the roller system works
well<00:05:35.260> I'm<00:05:35.560> a<00:05:36.250> little<00:05:36.490> bit<00:05:36.610> over<00:05:36.760> 6<00:05:37.000> foot<00:05:37.180> so

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:37.540 
well I'm a little bit over 6 foot so

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.170 
well I'm a little bit over 6 foot so
this<00:05:38.140> expandable<00:05:38.800> handle<00:05:39.160> that<00:05:39.670> works<00:05:39.970> well

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:40.180 
this expandable handle that works well

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.940 
this expandable handle that works well
if<00:05:40.270> you're<00:05:40.390> about<00:05:40.570> my<00:05:40.630> height<00:05:40.990> and<00:05:41.230> or<00:05:41.590> shorter

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:41.950 
if you're about my height and or shorter

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:44.310 
if you're about my height and or shorter
you<00:05:41.980> have<00:05:42.220> it<00:05:42.370> to<00:05:42.550> retract<00:05:43.330> so<00:05:43.930> that<00:05:44.050> gives<00:05:44.230> you

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:44.320 
you have it to retract so that gives you

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:47.160 
you have it to retract so that gives you
some<00:05:44.350> idea<00:05:44.980> of<00:05:45.190> how<00:05:45.340> well<00:05:45.550> that<00:05:45.580> works<00:05:46.170> also

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:47.170 
some idea of how well that works also

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:49.290 
some idea of how well that works also
thing<00:05:47.380> is<00:05:47.470> important<00:05:47.920> to<00:05:48.280> show<00:05:48.490> how<00:05:48.670> fast<00:05:49.000> it

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
thing is important to show how fast it

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.300 
thing is important to show how fast it
collapses<00:05:50.050> so<00:05:50.080> I've<00:05:50.200> sped<00:05:50.440> it<00:05:50.530> up<00:05:50.650> to<00:05:51.040> show<00:05:51.070> the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
collapses so I've sped it up to show the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.160 
collapses so I've sped it up to show the
unpacking<00:05:51.580> process<00:05:51.790> but<00:05:52.780> this<00:05:52.900> works

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:53.170 
unpacking process but this works

00:05:53.170 --> 00:05:54.900 
unpacking process but this works
extremely<00:05:53.530> well<00:05:53.740> and<00:05:54.040> guess<00:05:54.190> what<00:05:54.430> when

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
extremely well and guess what when

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.550 
extremely well and guess what when
you're<00:05:55.030> done<00:05:55.240> with<00:05:55.450> this<00:05:55.540> luggage<00:05:55.870> you<00:05:56.290> put<00:05:56.470> it

getting<00:06:03.190> in<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:03.460> way<00:06:03.580> so<00:06:03.640> it<00:06:03.880> ends<00:06:04.030> up<00:06:04.150> in<00:06:04.300> the

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:04.360 
getting in the way so it ends up in the

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.930 
getting in the way so it ends up in the
garage<00:06:04.510> and<00:06:04.960> that's<00:06:05.290> always<00:06:05.560> a<00:06:05.710> problem<00:06:06.070> so<00:06:06.790> if

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:06.940
