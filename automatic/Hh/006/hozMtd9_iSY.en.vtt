00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:02.040
 the origami 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.710
 origami the art of Japanese origin of folding paper to get 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.590
 figures of various shapes 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.590
 Spanish is also known as origami 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.929
 in the origami he uses scissors 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:15.980
 neither glue nor glasses 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:17.949
 just the paper and the hands 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:22.910
 therefore with only a few sheets of paper I can have their different bodies 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.079
 geometric shapes 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.999
 the word origami comes from japanese 

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.849
 what does it mean to argue 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:31.779
 and cami 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.790
 what does it mean 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.190
 behind time this act has had changes in the name 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.220
 in the first centuries it was called 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.350
 predictable fixed paper 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.020
 that actually these words that are used for the spirits of the gods 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 because in the beginning offerings are made to these deities 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:53.410
 using 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.850
 figures 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.500
 passed the threads and took the name of the tasting the Spanish exercises of 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:01.750
 bent 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.060
 but it was in 1830 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.550
 when the word origami was developed from the roots oruro 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:09.690
 prosecution 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.260
 previously 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:16.750
 one of the important centers of the origami genre is Spain where 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.750
 they dined the word origami 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.850
 the origami 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.460
 is defined as an educational art 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.720
 which people develop their artistic and intellectual expression 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.970
 the particularity of this technique is the transformation of paper 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.020
 in the form of different sizes and symbols 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.720
 starting from a base of 100 correct ocular blocks that can go from 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.160
 simple models 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.070
 until folded its great complexity 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.070
 the preferred ones to model are animals 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.730
 and trees among other reasons 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.890
 it has been proven that the cope reflects there or diminishes the problems 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.950
 psychic and psychological 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.170
 since being concentrated doing manual activities the person 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.030
 relaxes 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.969
 stimulates mental processes and aims to keep the practitioner away 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.259
 of his obsessions 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:10.759
 and fears 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.879
 Origami behavior therapy leads to sharing feelings and 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.709
 Knowledge helps solve problems 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:22.530
 you experience a non-verbal communication is a scenario of cute goals 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.099
 opportunity for non-threatening approaches leads to the feeling of 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:28.119
 the acceptation 

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:31.179
 it is an opportunity to enjoy and relax 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:35.179
 It is also a pastime that was experienced when origami was applied for 

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:37.989
 rehabilitation of patients 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:41.209
 origami also has a scientific side 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.139
 depending on the preferences of each fighter 

00:02:44.139 --> 00:02:46.289
 with that creation system 

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.869
 the pines or more symmetry operations 

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:54.339
 sometimes quite complex and can be ideal thus studied methodologically 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.489
 in terms of metrics 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.599
 the mathematical character that can have paper folding 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.370
 It is not at odds with the artistic one, although it does not have to coincide either 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:08.950
 For example, in the scientific aspect of origami we can mention the 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.890
 amateurs who are dedicated to demonstrate geometric theorems 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:14.799
 using on paper 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.260
 hypotheses about to be theorems there are even published works on the 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.469
 solving third-degree equations 

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:23.749
 just folding the paper 

00:03:23.749 --> 00:03:28.109
 knowing now is that if really the art of making sure the paper 

00:03:28.109 --> 00:03:29.760
 if I read the field that covers 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.169
 I understand your millenary history analyzing 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.259
 but at the same time making each our criticism 

00:03:36.779 --> 00:03:41.339
 towards this art, courses and complex I convinced rhodes to apply to different 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.820
 branches 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.110
 just leave the invitation to take an hour 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.839
 and experience 

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:47.869
 the end of the article
