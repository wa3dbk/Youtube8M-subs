 hello i am other windows phone state 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.670
 known for a good user experience 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.680
 from high-end models to 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.270
 loo and models and we here one 

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.970
 slip-on of wow 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.830
 the huawei ascend w1 and we will see if 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.689
 it is also the case with this device 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.189
 included is an adapter the device 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.869
 itself including battery 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:33.600
 a headset and a micro-usb cable with 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:36.810
 its 4 inch screen of 480 by 800 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.399
 pixel resolution is the huawei ascend w1 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.870
 and nice device 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.090
 he is not too big but certainly not 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
 too small it fits nicely in the hand 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.969
 and yes actually it is finished on one 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 good way 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.480
 after the front will of course still find 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.699
 a front facing camera another number 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.960
 sensors and a speaker grill all the way 

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.050
 at the bottom we find three 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.280
 yes standard windows of buttons here 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.379
 the edge processed is also one 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.850
 microphone and at the bottom we find 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.359
 another micro-usb port to use it up 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 load 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.050
 well then you go to the right side 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.430
 find the camera button on the 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.890
 at the top we find the on and off button 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 and the headset port on the left side 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.729
 we find volume buttons 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.979
 to the back there we find the 5 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.210
 megapixel camera with flash above it 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.409
 also a second microphone for 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.970
 noise reduction 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.009
 and at the bottom we find another one 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.049
 speaker grill well as the backs 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.979
 just pick up our nails here 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.840
 the bottom 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.460
 turn against it you should back 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.960
 valve removal that feels like you 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.540
 will destroy it but you can 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.710
 now we have the eight pep by clicking 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.630
 removed we find it here 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.530
 SIM card slot and the micro SD card 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:39.180
 Finally we are going to see how we got one 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.549
 exactly works well it is of course one 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.180
 windows phone windows phone 8 it's running 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.740
 on it 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.840
 then as we are used to with windows 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.479
 we also see different languages ​​live 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.250
 tiles that display information 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.320
 and of course smaller chelsea chance 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420
 display different sizes 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.969
 if you drive to the right a fully 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.619
 overview of all standard applications 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.420
 we see that the windows actually came 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.219
 fairly bald 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 we do not really see changes 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.740
 windows phones only see one more 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.399
 bluetooth option to contacts 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.630
 import 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.130
 but otherwise there is none 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.370
 applications included that are not 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.810
 standard in your windows 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.459
 That makes that yes that the pretty few 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.560
 further about that is that it 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:18.360
 device just runs smoothly through the 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.890
 do core 1.2 giga already 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.990
 the process so everything runs smoothly 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.850
 smooth if you have internet for example 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.670
 browser opens and we go to competent 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.050
 the website such as pdashop 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.540
 and then naturally come back to fine 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.770
 type the windows phone keyboard and we 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.330
 go to pda we are not before 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.550
 he has not been cached 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.020
 we see that it comes in very quickly and also 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.540
 that the pictures don't last long 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.130
 waiting to wait so yes that makes 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.960
 the device really fine fine 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.100
 his compact device works too 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.290
 easy to take with you 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.850
 which makes it actually business-like 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.140
 considering a very nice device it is anyway 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.730
 a lo lo range 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.860
 windows phone device but yes in it 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.420
 use when you open things when you continue 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.820
 you actually notice things scrolling 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.320
 not that this is a 1.2 gigahertz target choir 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.660
 is what is in it but then you still have it 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.160
 the idea that it's a piece a piece anyway 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.450
 float device 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.040
 you can also easily go through 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.630
 multitasking by the back button just what 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.489
 longer hold can be very 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.690
 simply go back well we are going too 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.230
 watch a movie 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:14.160
 Four inch gps panel very well 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:18.030
 interesting to watch than it is 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.140
 as well as from ubs benul 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.459
 are used to the colors 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.459
 true to nature 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 find the sound a bit louder 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.630
 well then we heard the noise 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.489
 reasonable good it is not 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.799
 shrill it can't be super hard but it 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:33.330
 just looks good and we see that yes 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.549
 everything is just neatly displayed 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:40.170
 color comes true to nature and it is 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.310
 fortunately also flats do not see you the 5 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.959
 megapixel camera 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.970
 well can easily take a photo by 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.290
 just keep the photo button 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.000
 first that half so that it focuses 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:48.959
 and then push through 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.549
 well for the rest of course have one 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.560
 number of settings that you can return 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.209
 naturally find flash settings 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.799
 different lenses that we are also used to 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:57.299
 are from windows phone that you 

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:58.920
 different applications that use 

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.600
 make the camera that integrated into it 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.130
 the camera application 

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.630
 and for dress see some here 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.459
 institutions that we can do here 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.000
 Customizing and of course also 

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:11.160
 video settings he can in 720 p 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.930
 we also go for a short film 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.670
 looked at the front facing camera 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.890
 of party camera is not much 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.380
 but is not just great 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.810
 if you look yes for little skype or something 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.410
 that is no problem at all we are going now 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.500
 also just watch a movie see 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.770
 you get a movie going 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:31.330
 with the wow agent2 one 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.360
 the video is included in the maximum 

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:37.380
 resolution of 720 p and the sound comes 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.380
 from the device itself 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.740
 the axis and two one available over 

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.210
 approximately 1.6 gigabytes of free disk space 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.860
 which means you cannot use so many apps 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.870
 install since they are not on the 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.140
 micro sd card may also have 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.730
 that 512 megabytes of internal memory and 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.620
 that again ensures that not all 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:58.620
 large apps can be installed 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:04.030
 the 1.2 gigahertz quadcore processor 

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.320
 the w e does its job very well 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:07.450
 he also has a long battery life 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:12.580
 and there will be a stick version of windows 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:14.260
 phone 8 included where some entry 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.900
 Android smartphones are really bad 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:18.580
 both buildings feel that slowly 

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.470
 sn2 one 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.330
 not the case he offers a nice and 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.919
 fast user experience where the 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.300
 difference with the high-end models only 

00:05:23.919 --> 00:05:26.650
 but notice if your device too 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.500
 actually in addition 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:31.630
