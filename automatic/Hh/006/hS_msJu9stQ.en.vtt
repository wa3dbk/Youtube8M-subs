causing organism and let's introduce you

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.099 
causing organism and let's introduce you
to<00:00:22.170> some<00:00:22.350> of<00:00:22.380> these<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> all<00:00:24.240> from<00:00:24.779> the

just<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.960> this<00:01:48.200> or<00:01:48.470> protists<00:01:49.340> and<00:01:49.460> in<00:01:50.390> fact

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
just like this or protists and in fact

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.649 
just like this or protists and in fact
this<00:01:50.810> is<00:01:50.990> actually<00:01:51.409> a<00:01:51.439> red<00:01:51.860> cell<00:01:52.479> and<00:01:53.479> that's

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
this is actually a red cell and that's

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.300 
this is actually a red cell and that's
not<00:01:53.930> what<00:01:54.200> we're<00:01:54.380> interested<00:01:54.619> in<00:01:55.009> what<00:01:55.190> we're

not what we're interested in what we're
actually<00:01:55.430> interested<00:01:55.880> in<00:01:56.180> is<00:01:57.220> inside<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.820> red

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
actually interested in is inside the red

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.749 
actually interested in is inside the red
cell<00:01:59.330> here<00:01:59.869> there's<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:00.799> single-celled

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:01.759 
cell here there's a single-celled

organism<00:02:03.520> which<00:02:04.520> is<00:02:04.700> called<00:02:05.350> Plasmodium<00:02:07.750> so

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
organism which is called Plasmodium so

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.170 
organism which is called Plasmodium so
this<00:02:08.840> is<00:02:09.050> a<00:02:09.080> single-celled<00:02:09.920> organism

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:10.180 
this is a single-celled organism

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.640 
this is a single-celled organism
