00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
and it will stop cold in front of a

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.660 
and it will stop cold in front of a
picture<00:00:48.260> that<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.530> had<00:00:48.680> not<00:00:48.860> really<00:00:49.310> spent<00:00:49.610> a

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
probably my German are bringing I think

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.070

just<00:01:36.770> from<00:01:37.010> a<00:01:37.510> market<00:01:38.510> point<00:01:38.659> of<00:01:38.840> view<00:01:38.930> it

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
just from a market point of view it

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.260 
just from a market point of view it
feels<00:01:39.290> there<00:01:39.530> is<00:01:39.619> a<00:01:39.650> little<00:01:39.920> more<00:01:40.280> available<00:01:41.030> I

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
feels there is a little more available I

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.539 
feels there is a little more available I
found<00:01:41.869> that<00:01:42.049> these<00:01:42.229> paintings<00:01:42.560> are<00:01:42.890> very<00:01:43.310> very

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
found that these paintings are very very

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.030 
found that these paintings are very very
wonderful<00:01:43.790> in<00:01:44.420> juxtaposition<00:01:44.840> with<00:01:45.650> with
