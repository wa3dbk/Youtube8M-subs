00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.690
 hello to all you are on jeuactu 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.190
 we are cramped 2015 with laura 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.440
 linney this time we stopped 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.300
 at electronic art who owns a line 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 up quite a lot this year but there 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.410
 we will tell you about the Mirror's Edge 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.060
 catalyst that was so announced a few 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.410
 days before the show but unveiled in 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.689
 great pump here during the conference 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.390
 of press then you are you then play on 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.340
 xbox one it seems to me so give me 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 your first impressions of the game me 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.969
 seen from a distance like that I have the impression 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.620
 it's the same but different but 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.300
 which keeps is essentially the same 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 basics the same fundamentals because well 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.629
 obviously they did not reveal everything 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.980
 today because he wants when 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.510
 even keep surprises and under the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.070
 elbow to the dice developers 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.390
 but a big change that has been 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.489
 announced today is that the game 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.590
 will be open world unlike the first 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.820
 episode so in the first mirror's 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.250
 edge and chain the missions of a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.420
 particular order you followed the story 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.190
 there between each mission you will be able 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.199
 to visit the city in which 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.850
 roll out the game called the city of 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.159
 ice okay so you talk to me about 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 black skin 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.409
 electronic arts had said that it was 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.900
 not really a suite was not no 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.820
 more a reboot but rather another 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.290
 mirror's edge is what at the level of 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.250
 the story because here we take the 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.869
 faith character but is that 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.640
 it's the same story we kill music on 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.820
 turns in ice life from afar 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.110
 I see a clean white with some 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.090
 red pieces that allow 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.619
 to interact with the decor is what 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.850
 finally it's not the same thing 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.710
 we are still markers and his 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:30.329
 first marriage the story but actually 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.220
 looks like that of the first 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.689
 episode so you'll find yourself in the 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.579
 skin of peace is the same heroine 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.290
 in a city that is controlled in fact 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:39.450
 by sir kruger with all his army 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.479
 all the individual freedoms of the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.579
 local population have been removed so 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.570
 it's a kind of dictatorship in celebration and 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.189
 at the beginning of the year, words do you 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.960
 found with fes who in prison in 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.120
 cell and who will benefit from a 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.770
 remission and therefore 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.300
 out of the prisons she has to find a 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.370
 work in less than 14 players otherwise 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.050
 it's back to the prison box 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.370
 once that actually comes out and falls on 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.140
 eric harris so the mysterious 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.180
 character we had seen in the 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.370
 through a visibly game trailer 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.160
 a certain noah who is waiting for them 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:10.740
 precisely I think fight but what 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.630
 krueger and his good mercenary buddies 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.270
 okay the first episode I'm not 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.040
 if you remember he had not been 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.370
 messed up the island it was not good 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.810
 sold 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.250
 it must be said what is it not 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.800
 sold well because people blame 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.720
 that he was a little too contemplative not 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.550
 his actions then is this time 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.660
 ci they made the game more action 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:30.310
 more dynamic 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.320
 is it better than before 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.570
 at all in fact they actually have are 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.900
 watched the basics of the game so you 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:40.210
 will you end up with a gameplay where you 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.270
 will be able to climb on the walls do 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.320
 full of buttocks movements will not be able 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:46.450
 take up arms while in the 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.340
 first episode and could find 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.050
 disarm his opponents then pulled a 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.380
 or two shots if I say no 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.210
 foolery 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.070
 there is a menu with fists 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.670
 feet he'll have to stay all the time 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.130
 moving 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.480
 if you stay static you will take the 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.930
 balls more easily so that's 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.310
 interesting 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.170
 and then hey it's true he can give 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.240
 also news finally costs in 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:05.440
 rather special positions by 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.360
 example when she takes a rope 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.550
 when the key is slipped she can jump 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:10.510
 in the void to sow an opponent a 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.800
 sum that seems to take pleasure 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.940
 could not do it so I 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:14.230
 the impression that some of the 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.760
 things to hefei this same so carey 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.380
 fundamental but admit the 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.930
 people who did not like the first 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.310
 episode will not necessarily adhere to 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.780
 this sequel finally this reboot between 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.070
 quotes qua non not necessarily after 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.230
 the developers have made it clear he 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.980
 wanted to respect the 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.410
 origins of the series 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.120
 he did not want to switch to 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.590
 a tps and classic 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.500
 it is true that the mirror's edge 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.350
 particularity is 2 here to embody 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.090
 a runner makes a chassis so I 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.100
 think he did not want either because 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.570
 that there on the other side of the line 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:45.000
 in fact yeah but month after month in 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.500
 choice term 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.300
 as well as commercial art 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.440
 not quite understand the reboot of 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.390
 this game if it's to resume 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.100
 exactly what was done in 2008 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.630
 just by bringing open world 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.850
 I have the impression that they will be wrong 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.900
 again I think if he allows himself to 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.000
 take this risk 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.740
 behind electronic art caraquet but 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.970
 some financial ban I think if 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.510
 it had been another die size editor 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.130
 smaller 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.380
 yes necessarily and mirror's edge and 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.320
 catÃ©sis did not see the light so here we go 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:12.300
 okay okay okay so good end 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.980
 good impression and enjoyed a game 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.230
 where everything was already fans of the first 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.760
 chord episode heard and that's it 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.450
 well on the catalyst coming out so 

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.940
 very soon 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:21.810
 you can eat early 2016 yeah that's at 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.540
 February 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:27.150
 mathieu twist and that's on pc ps 4 and 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.500
 xbox one so here we will have the opportunity 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.070
 to review it in more detail 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.660
 shortly 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.890
 in any case you can continue to us
