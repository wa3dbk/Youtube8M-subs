 preserve the state of health of the

 detergent should be handled with caution 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.369
 because although it is appropriate from the point 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.470
 of hygienic view can constitute a

 to all the sea that will be part of 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.729
 the farm in order to prevent 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.220
 dissemination of diseases in case of 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:12.860

 inadequate handling conditions that 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.480
 cause stress in animals so 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.910
 that the management of each productive stage 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 must be carried out properly for 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:35.830
 avoid losses due to these situations 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.570
 vaccination in Mexico only one is used 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.030
 vaccine against pasteurellosis as 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:47.060
 preventive measure before starting the

 winter it can be prepared with 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:52.100
 the specific serotypes that affect 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.620
 the farm which is advisable and 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.290
 there are bacteria on the market 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.480
 various pathogens that have a margin 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.819
 of effectiveness for the prevention of 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:06.420
 respiratory conditions in the winter 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:08.549
 digestive syndrome at this point it 

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.069
 find all the conditions that 

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:14.609
 can cause the appearance of diarrhea in 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.980
 the rabbits the diarrheas are those 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:19.620
 stools that do not have the form 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.900
 granular feature or ball that 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.680
 they normally have the excrement of 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.170
 rabbits the appearance of diarrhea can 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.840
 own multiple causes as 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.389
 infectious diseases parasites 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:36.950
 intestinal inadequate regimen 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:39.870
 food intoxications cooling 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.810
 etcetera unless they are caused by 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.060
 microbes or parasites will be taken more 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.209
 for a syndrome or ailment that for a 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:50.730
 Disease diarrheas can be 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.370
 especially dangerous in the kits 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:56.730
 from the first age to the three or 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.069
 four months of age are usually presented 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:01.079
 more often when you go over 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.139
 maternal milk regime to the 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:06.280
 vegetarian diet is worth saying in 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:08.980
 the time of weaning 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:12.120
 diarrheas of infectious origin or 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.770
 parasitic usually gravity 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.079
 possibly the deepest with 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:20.350
 all security those that stop with 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:23.200
 less ease the affected animal is 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.419
 weakens weakens swelling and 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.419
 abdominal pain and bowel movements 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:28.940
 they can start to show up 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:31.160
 bloody 

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:33.830
 if you do not intervene in time 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.500
 outcome is fatal respiratory syndrome 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.750
 the respiratory processes in the 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.760
 farms with nicolás constitute the 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:44.690
 main source of economic losses 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.370
 on farms these losses are 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.190
 they produce not only as a consequence 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.100
 direct from casualties that in some 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.810
 cases can be very numerous but by 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.260
 its indirect effects on 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.960
 production respiratory problems 

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:02.330
 they force to increase the replacement of 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 mothers both for losses in their 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.120
 yields as by disposing of the 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.100
 Chronic patients and animals 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:12.800
 excessively thin, unusable for 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:15.440
 production problems 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:18.320
 Respiratory diseases require an increase in 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:21.110
 replacement of mothers both for losses 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.500
 in its yields as per the waste 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.480
 of the chronically ill and animals 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:28.070
 excessively thin, unusable for 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:31.040
 the production 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.560
 etiology the respiratory processes in 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:36.890
 the rabbit are always the consequence 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:39.140
 joint of several risk factors 

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:41.570
 The main cause is the 

00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:43.940
 pasteurella multocida however to 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:46.360
 often it is accompanied by other germs 

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:49.960
 as edge of yabrán antiseptic 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:52.430
 'staphylococcus aureus' streptococcus 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.140
 all these germs come to 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.590
 unleash or aggravate the picture 

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:59.870
 respiratory development processes 

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:02.729
 Respiratory diseases can develop from 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.370
 acute or chronic form 

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:07.370
 thanks for your attention drones
