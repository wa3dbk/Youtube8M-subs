00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:08.620 

how<00:00:06.140> did<00:00:06.350> everyone<00:00:06.559> this<00:00:07.399> is<00:00:07.460> mr.<00:00:07.910> Cozzi<00:00:08.330> again

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:08.630 
how did everyone this is mr. Cozzi again

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.390 
how did everyone this is mr. Cozzi again
and<00:00:09.410> today<00:00:09.740> we're<00:00:09.950> going<00:00:10.040> to<00:00:10.100> talk<00:00:10.370> about

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400 
and today we're going to talk about

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.940 
and today we're going to talk about
light<00:00:10.940> as<00:00:11.150> a<00:00:11.210> particle<00:00:11.720> we've<00:00:12.320> been<00:00:12.500> talking

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:12.950 
light as a particle we've been talking

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.179 
light as a particle we've been talking
about<00:00:13.010> light<00:00:13.640> as<00:00:13.880> a<00:00:13.940> wave<00:00:14.780> and<00:00:15.470> we've<00:00:16.070> been

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:16.189 
about light as a wave and we've been

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.710 
about light as a wave and we've been
talking<00:00:16.430> about<00:00:16.460> the<00:00:16.640> wave<00:00:16.820> properties<00:00:17.509> of

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:17.720 
talking about the wave properties of

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.109 
talking about the wave properties of
light<00:00:17.929> and<00:00:18.320> how<00:00:18.800> its<00:00:19.009> supported<00:00:19.579> by<00:00:19.609> James

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:20.119 
light and how its supported by James

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:20.859 
light and how its supported by James
Clerk<00:00:20.300> Maxwell

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
Clerk Maxwell

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.329 
Clerk Maxwell
and<00:00:21.099> his<00:00:22.099> equations<00:00:22.669> but<00:00:23.630> in<00:00:24.019> the<00:00:24.199> 1900s<00:00:25.039> it

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:25.339 
and his equations but in the 1900s it

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:28.300 
and his equations but in the 1900s it
was<00:00:25.939> obvious<00:00:26.509> that<00:00:26.539> light<00:00:27.199> wasn't<00:00:27.589> just<00:00:28.130> a

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310 
was obvious that light wasn't just a

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:29.950 
was obvious that light wasn't just a
wave<00:00:28.550> and<00:00:28.880> many<00:00:29.119> scientists<00:00:29.659> began<00:00:29.900> to

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
wave and many scientists began to

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.740 
wave and many scientists began to
question<00:00:30.349> whether<00:00:31.249> or<00:00:31.429> not<00:00:31.609> explaining<00:00:32.540> light

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
question whether or not explaining light

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.140 
question whether or not explaining light
as<00:00:32.989> a<00:00:33.020> wave<00:00:33.140> was<00:00:33.620> sufficient<00:00:34.190> there<00:00:34.850> were<00:00:34.970> just

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:35.150 
as a wave was sufficient there were just

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.030 
as a wave was sufficient there were just
some<00:00:35.390> things<00:00:35.750> such<00:00:36.080> as<00:00:36.260> the<00:00:36.380> photoelectric

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
some things such as the photoelectric

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.820 
some things such as the photoelectric
effect<00:00:37.070> that<00:00:37.970> couldn't<00:00:38.270> be<00:00:38.360> answered

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
effect that couldn't be answered

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.680 
effect that couldn't be answered
completely<00:00:39.830> by<00:00:40.040> the<00:00:40.610> idea<00:00:41.000> that<00:00:41.060> light<00:00:41.420> was<00:00:41.630> a

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
completely by the idea that light was a

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.560 
completely by the idea that light was a
wave<00:00:41.830> so<00:00:42.830> some<00:00:43.130> scientists<00:00:43.580> began<00:00:44.180> to<00:00:44.330> develop

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
wave so some scientists began to develop

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.020 
wave so some scientists began to develop
other<00:00:44.870> ideas<00:00:45.350> one<00:00:46.220> of<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.340> first<00:00:46.580> to<00:00:46.730> do<00:00:46.850> this

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
other ideas one of the first to do this

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.570 
other ideas one of the first to do this
was<00:00:47.300> a<00:00:47.660> Max<00:00:48.020> Planck<00:00:48.350> and<00:00:48.560> Max<00:00:49.280> Planck

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:49.580 
was a Max Planck and Max Planck

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.910 
was a Max Planck and Max Planck
suggested<00:00:50.150> that<00:00:50.270> light<00:00:50.510> could<00:00:51.320> possibly<00:00:51.740> in

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
suggested that light could possibly in

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.540 
suggested that light could possibly in
it<00:00:52.040> be<00:00:52.190> in<00:00:52.310> packets<00:00:52.910> of<00:00:53.030> energy<00:00:53.210> and<00:00:54.370> he<00:00:55.370> got

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
it be in packets of energy and he got

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.220 
it be in packets of energy and he got
this<00:00:55.760> idea<00:00:56.020> from<00:00:57.020> his<00:00:57.590> work<00:00:57.950> with<00:00:58.220> certain

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
this idea from his work with certain

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.720 
this idea from his work with certain
wavelengths<00:01:00.230> of<00:01:00.290> light<00:01:00.350> as<00:01:00.710> he<00:01:01.430> worked<00:01:01.610> with

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
wavelengths of light as he worked with

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.730 
wavelengths of light as he worked with
these<00:01:01.850> different<00:01:02.300> wavelengths<00:01:02.810> of<00:01:02.900> light<00:01:02.990> he

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:03.740 
these different wavelengths of light he

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:06.220 
these different wavelengths of light he
began<00:01:04.040> to<00:01:04.220> compare<00:01:04.699> their<00:01:05.449> frequency<00:01:06.080> with

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.230 
began to compare their frequency with

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.260 
began to compare their frequency with
their<00:01:06.350> energy<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.860> he<00:01:07.430> realized<00:01:07.909> that<00:01:08.090> the

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
their energy and he realized that the

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.620 
their energy and he realized that the
energy<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.870> the<00:01:08.990> frequency<00:01:09.650> were<00:01:10.630> directly

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
energy and the frequency were directly

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.060 
energy and the frequency were directly
proportional<00:01:12.290> the<00:01:12.320> higher<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:12.890> frequency

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
proportional the higher the frequency

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.160 
proportional the higher the frequency
the<00:01:13.610> higher<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.880> energy<00:01:14.480> and<00:01:15.670> he<00:01:16.780> did<00:01:17.780> several

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
the higher the energy and he did several

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.320 
the higher the energy and he did several
experiments<00:01:19.100> in<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:19.310> laboratory<00:01:19.520> he

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
experiments in the laboratory he

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.360 
experiments in the laboratory he
developed<00:01:20.960> collected<00:01:21.650> a<00:01:21.710> lot<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:21.979> empirical

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
developed collected a lot of empirical

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.820 
developed collected a lot of empirical
evidence<00:01:22.700> as<00:01:23.120> he<00:01:23.600> gathered<00:01:24.200> this<00:01:24.320> empirical

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
evidence as he gathered this empirical

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.760 
evidence as he gathered this empirical
evidence<00:01:25.190> he<00:01:25.790> realized<00:01:26.300> that<00:01:26.630> light<00:01:27.229> must<00:01:27.620> be

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
evidence he realized that light must be

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:29.590 
evidence he realized that light must be
in<00:01:27.860> these<00:01:27.979> packets<00:01:28.490> of<00:01:28.550> energy<00:01:28.670> can't<00:01:29.270> be<00:01:29.420> just

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
in these packets of energy can't be just

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:32.440 
in these packets of energy can't be just
a<00:01:29.690> continuous<00:01:30.500> source<00:01:31.430> of<00:01:31.670> energy<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:32.090> has<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
a continuous source of energy it has to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.539 
a continuous source of energy it has to
be<00:01:32.600> possibly<00:01:33.560> in<00:01:33.620> these<00:01:33.740> little<00:01:33.979> packets<00:01:34.400> of

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:34.549 
be possibly in these little packets of

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:36.820 
be possibly in these little packets of
energy<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.180> that<00:01:36.020> these<00:01:36.200> little<00:01:36.500> pieces<00:01:36.680> of

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
energy and that these little pieces of

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.520 
energy and that these little pieces of
energy<00:01:37.190> were<00:01:37.370> quantized<00:01:38.090> and<00:01:38.450> so<00:01:39.110> he<00:01:39.260> called

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
energy were quantized and so he called

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.969 
energy were quantized and so he called
these<00:01:39.740> little<00:01:39.979> packets<00:01:40.450> quantum<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.979> today

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:42.979 
these little packets quantum and today

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:45.609 
these little packets quantum and today
we<00:01:43.220> used<00:01:43.520> that<00:01:43.729> word<00:01:43.970> to<00:01:44.020> talk<00:01:45.020> about<00:01:45.380> the

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:45.619 
we used that word to talk about the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:47.230 
we used that word to talk about the
quantum<00:01:46.040> mechanics<00:01:46.580> I<00:01:46.700> believe<00:01:46.940> that<00:01:47.090> was

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
quantum mechanics I believe that was

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.380 
quantum mechanics I believe that was
done<00:01:47.390> in<00:01:47.540> his<00:01:47.750> honor<00:01:47.990> and<00:01:48.280> he<00:01:49.280> also<00:01:49.460> referred

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:50.390 
done in his honor and he also referred

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:53.440 
done in his honor and he also referred
to<00:01:50.420> these<00:01:50.600> in<00:01:50.780> the<00:01:50.900> plural<00:01:51.170> as<00:01:51.380> quanta<00:01:51.979> so<00:01:52.450> Max

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
to these in the plural as quanta so Max

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.289 
to these in the plural as quanta so Max
Planck<00:01:54.369> developed<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.460> idea<00:01:55.640> of<00:01:55.850> quantum

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
Planck developed this idea of quantum

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:59.800 
Planck developed this idea of quantum
and<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.710> what<00:01:57.860> is<00:01:57.979> a<00:01:58.010> quantum<00:01:58.520> and<00:01:59.299> he<00:01:59.479> defined

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
and so what is a quantum and he defined

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.660 
and so what is a quantum and he defined
the<00:01:59.990> quantum<00:02:00.409> as<00:02:00.530> a<00:02:00.590> small<00:02:01.010> packet<00:02:01.549> of

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
the quantum as a small packet of

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.719 
the quantum as a small packet of
quantized<00:02:02.390> energy<00:02:03.200> and<00:02:03.439> today<00:02:03.950> we<00:02:04.340> call<00:02:04.549> these

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
quantized energy and today we call these

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:05.560 
quantized energy and today we call these
quantized

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:05.570 
quantized

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:08.350 
quantized
energy<00:02:06.159> photons<00:02:07.159> now<00:02:07.460> what<00:02:08.000> do<00:02:08.060> we<00:02:08.149> mean<00:02:08.179> by

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360

not particle and the particle like
characters<00:03:18.049> came<00:03:18.260> from<00:03:18.680> when<00:03:19.160> the<00:03:19.250> energy<00:03:19.849> got

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:20.599 
characters came from when the energy got

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.589 
characters came from when the energy got
high<00:03:21.079> and<00:03:21.579> the<00:03:22.579> wavelength<00:03:22.970> was<00:03:23.120> short

high and the wavelength was short

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.020 
high and the wavelength was short
then<00:03:24.380> you<00:03:24.620> had<00:03:24.889> particle-like<00:03:25.880> properties

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:26.030 
then you had particle-like properties

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.020 
then you had particle-like properties
and<00:03:26.900> when<00:03:27.380> the<00:03:27.500> wavelengths<00:03:28.069> were<00:03:28.190> long<00:03:28.549> and

and<00:04:13.280> for<00:04:14.280> wavelength<00:04:14.520> we<00:04:15.000> substitute<00:04:15.810> in<00:04:16.400> C

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:19.940 
and for wavelength we substitute in C
over<00:04:17.940> lambda<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.690> we<00:04:19.050> get<00:04:19.230> it<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.470> terms<00:04:19.680> of

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:29.940 
little photons had mass and if they had

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.330 
little photons had mass and if they had
massed<00:05:30.240> then<00:05:30.930> they<00:05:31.110> could<00:05:31.320> be<00:05:31.350> particles<00:05:31.950> but

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:32.340 
massed then they could be particles but

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.300 
massed then they could be particles but
they<00:05:32.460> only<00:05:32.700> had<00:05:33.180> mass<00:05:33.570> when<00:05:34.560> they<00:05:34.770> were<00:05:34.830> in

they only had mass when they were in
motion<00:05:36.210> or<00:05:36.360> energized<00:05:37.200> and<00:05:37.530> so<00:05:38.220> when<00:05:38.340> they<00:05:38.460> had

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
wavelengths they had high energy and

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:48.650 
wavelengths they had high energy and
therefore<00:05:45.690> they<00:05:46.080> had<00:05:46.320> mass<00:05:47.180> but<00:05:48.180> the<00:05:48.270> photons

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
therefore they had mass but the photons

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.320 
therefore they had mass but the photons

Einstein<00:06:19.950> showed<00:06:20.220> that<00:06:20.280> the<00:06:20.640> photon<00:06:21.450> could

Einstein showed that the photon could
