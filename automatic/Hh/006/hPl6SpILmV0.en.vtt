00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 tired of the usual potatoes in the pan or 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.960
 boiled here guys you today suggest me 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.880
 an absolutely irresistible method 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.800
 raising agent to prepare these vegetables 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.080
 so much but between great little ones 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.030
 the recipe of the day is a calm duchess 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.850
 I must admit, however, that I was inspired 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.650
 from French cuisine to prepare 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.779
 these duchess potatoes because they seem 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 It was our French neighbors a 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.550
 designing this beautiful outline is ultimately 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.470
 let's say it's not so difficult 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.720
 to prepare for which will be sufficient 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.550
 prepare a rich mashed mixing of 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.680
 clearly crushed boiled potatoes 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.210
 with an egg a little bit of butter 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.950
 grated parmesan cheese 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.329
 everything will then be reduced in effect 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.840
 that we will make to brown in the oven 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.059
 but we find out together dose of events for 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.620
 prepare duchess potatoes only 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:52.230
 necessary 500 g of potatoes 30 grams of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.890
 grated Parmesan cheese 30 g of 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.129
 butter then we still have an egg 20 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.960
 about milliliters of milk a bit of walnut 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.960
 Muscat if you like a little salt 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.450
 after cooking the steam potatoes le 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.130
 we put it inside the 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 potato masher here we do 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.020
 in short, the same procedure that 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.869
 we strive to make the curate very well 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.950
 crush the hot I recommend 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.240
 this we can put it from another 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.590
 part 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.079
 now we put the butter I recommend 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.299
 30 g of butter 

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.970
 yes I realize that we have one here 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:39.600
 good amount of fat though you have to 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.270
 also know that the original dose of the 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.479
 butter inside the mixture of 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.509
 I have rather high potatoes instead 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.600
 tried to reduce as little as possible 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.189
 the amount of butter 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.439
 now we can add the salt that 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.540
 before I didn't put it right because I am 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:02.759
 went to steam the potatoes 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:05.729
 very well now add a little bit of walnut 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.360
 Muscat if you like you can too 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.360
 add pepper 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:22.540
 plentiful since i like ok ne 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:28.470
 sorry for no good and now there 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.470
 let's mix new here 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.709
 even here I used only one man 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:43.540
 while the original recipe also speaks 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:45.160
 of two eggs per 500 g of potatoes then 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.940
 we mix to make a mixture 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.940
 nice smooth 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:58.000
 at this point we can also add 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:03:01.720
 grated Parmesan cheese and then yes 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 mixes and then as the last ingredient 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.640
 I suggest you add lots of milk 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:10.360
 just enough to get a dough 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:12.700
 that many recipes are rather soft 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:17.290
 do not add use do not add 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.209
 the milk but more a new addition me 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.150
 to save a little on the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:24.610
 calories therefore I avoid the use of many 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:25.989
 eggs and add a little milk and 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:26.970
 sure the result will be anyway 

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.450
 excellent 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.510
 let's continue to mix this is the 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.380
 right consistency in our dough 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:41.470
 very well now to make us suffer of 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:43.090
 of potatoes we're going to pour ours 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.010
 internal mixture of a porsche bag 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.980
 those to facilitate the commissioning 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:52.959
 form of everything I help myself with a tad bit 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:55.420
 of glass that we transfer in everything here 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:57.870
 inside and then proceed immediately to what 

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:57.870
 tufts 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.940
 and now that we have paid all the 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.670
 ours the potato dough inside 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:13.360
 of the sac Ã  poche we make actual 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.739
 so and fill our beautiful plate 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.959
 baked and in the meantime I already have 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:21.760
 Preheat oven to 180 degrees in 

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:28.360
 so that when we go to put in 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:30.280
 the plate and at random we got 36 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.740
 tufts now we are going to inform 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.930
 then 180 degrees for about 15 20 minutes 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.130
 maybe a green until they are 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.230
 beautiful golden ideals to serve as 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:43.180
 Duchess veal potato appetizer i 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:45.670
 strong and determined flavors for this yes 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.490
 they also go well with a good dish of 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:50.320
 meat or fish the delicacy 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.690
 still taste with a little bit of 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:55.360
 moderation because this outline is then 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.920
 among the most low-calorie well for every now and then 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.880
 a small tear to the rule can be 

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.880
 do not find
