ingredient so nephron years ago was once

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.800 
ingredient so nephron years ago was once
called<00:03:05.200> the<00:03:05.379> cousin<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.889> ephedra<00:03:06.540> and<00:03:07.540> it's

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
called the cousin of ephedra and it's

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.599 
called the cousin of ephedra and it's
going<00:03:07.959> to<00:03:08.049> it<00:03:08.530> is<00:03:08.799> a<00:03:08.829> stimulants<00:03:09.430> going<00:03:09.549> to

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
other than the caffeine you're going to

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.569 
other than the caffeine you're going to
get<00:03:16.150> a<00:03:16.180> boost<00:03:16.419> in<00:03:16.510> our<00:03:16.629> view<00:03:16.810> from<00:03:17.340> now<00:03:18.340> we're

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:18.579 
get a boost in our view from now we're

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:21.119 
get a boost in our view from now we're
going<00:03:18.760> into<00:03:19.030> their<00:03:19.620> Metroplex<00:03:20.620> which<00:03:20.829> is<00:03:20.979> our

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
going into their Metroplex which is our

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.439 
going into their Metroplex which is our
nitric<00:03:21.459> oxide<00:03:21.959> pump<00:03:22.959> enhancing<00:03:23.669> aspect<00:03:24.760> first

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:25.449 
nitric oxide pump enhancing aspect first

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:29.009 
nitric oxide pump enhancing aspect first
is<00:03:25.629> glycerol<00:03:26.260> mono<00:03:26.560> spirit<00:03:27.090> there's<00:03:28.090> 1000

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
is glycerol mono spirit there's 1000

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.569 
is glycerol mono spirit there's 1000
it's<00:03:29.290> going<00:03:29.409> to<00:03:29.470> be<00:03:29.560> 2,000<00:03:30.069> milligrams<00:03:30.280> of

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
it's going to be 2,000 milligrams of

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:32.490 
it's going to be 2,000 milligrams of
that<00:03:30.699> so<00:03:30.909> a<00:03:30.939> nice<00:03:31.180> dose<00:03:31.449> of<00:03:31.599> that<00:03:31.720> that's<00:03:32.260> going

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
that so a nice dose of that that's going

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.080 
that so a nice dose of that that's going
to<00:03:32.560> take<00:03:32.709> any<00:03:32.859> extra<00:03:33.220> cellular<00:03:33.549> water<00:03:33.909> you

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.090 
to take any extra cellular water you

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.030 
to take any extra cellular water you
have<00:03:34.299> and<00:03:34.599> put<00:03:34.629> into<00:03:35.019> the<00:03:35.229> muscle<00:03:35.620> cell<00:03:35.829> to

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
have and put into the muscle cell to

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.580 
have and put into the muscle cell to
increase<00:03:36.879> the<00:03:37.239> amount<00:03:37.479> of<00:03:37.510> water<00:03:37.750> inside<00:03:38.409> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
increase the amount of water inside the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.740 
increase the amount of water inside the
cell<00:03:38.829> so<00:03:39.159> that's<00:03:39.790> going<00:03:40.030> to<00:03:40.090> give<00:03:40.209> you<00:03:40.329> a<00:03:40.359> pump

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
cell so that's going to give you a pump

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.890 
cell so that's going to give you a pump
in<00:03:41.049> and<00:03:41.199> of<00:03:41.290> itself<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:43.180> after<00:03:43.569> that<00:03:43.689> you've

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
in and of itself then after that you've

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.710 
in and of itself then after that you've
got<00:03:43.930> potassium<00:03:44.439> nitrate<00:03:45.129> I<00:03:45.579> force<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.449> really

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
got potassium nitrate I force is really

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.210 
got potassium nitrate I force is really
doing<00:03:46.959> a<00:03:47.019> lot<00:03:47.049> to<00:03:47.290> bring<00:03:47.409> potassium<00:03:47.949> nitrate

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
doing a lot to bring potassium nitrate

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.949 
doing a lot to bring potassium nitrate
out<00:03:48.370> to<00:03:48.489> the<00:03:48.579> forefront<00:03:48.790> and<00:03:49.479> will<00:03:49.659> increase

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
out to the forefront and will increase

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.330 
out to the forefront and will increase
nitric<00:03:50.290> oxide<00:03:50.620> levels<00:03:50.739> so<00:03:50.979> you've<00:03:51.069> got<00:03:51.189> two

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
nitric oxide levels so you've got two

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.559 
nitric oxide levels so you've got two
things<00:03:51.639> that<00:03:51.819> are<00:03:51.939> really<00:03:52.150> going<00:03:52.299> to<00:03:52.389> enhance

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:52.569 
things that are really going to enhance

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.249 
things that are really going to enhance
your<00:03:53.049> pumps<00:03:53.739> while<00:03:53.949> you're<00:03:54.069> working<00:03:54.129> out<00:03:55.259> so

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:56.259 
your pumps while you're working out so

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.369 
your pumps while you're working out so
next<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:57.009> what<00:03:57.280> they<00:03:57.370> call<00:03:57.519> cognitive<00:03:57.819> plus

00:03:58.369 --> 00:03:58.379 
next is what they call cognitive plus

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.860 
next is what they call cognitive plus

cognitive<00:04:44.410> function<00:04:44.919> and<00:04:45.010> things<00:04:45.160> like<00:04:45.250> that

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:45.310 
cognitive function and things like that

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:46.980 
cognitive function and things like that
so<00:04:45.460> this<00:04:45.760> is<00:04:45.820> just<00:04:45.970> only<00:04:46.270> going<00:04:46.480> to<00:04:46.600> enhance

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
so this is just only going to enhance

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.980 
so this is just only going to enhance
that<00:04:47.320> so<00:04:47.919> the<00:04:48.400> nice<00:04:48.820> thing<00:04:49.060> is<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.450> if<00:04:49.690> you<00:04:49.810> can

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:49.990 
that so the nice thing is is if you can

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.870 
that so the nice thing is is if you can
get<00:04:50.110> a<00:04:50.139> nice<00:04:51.010> increase<00:04:51.460> in<00:04:51.669> concentration

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.159 
micrograms does something very similar
so<00:05:01.480> it's<00:05:01.600> going<00:05:01.720> to<00:05:01.780> increase<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
so it's going to increase the

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.140 
so it's going to increase the
acetylcholine<00:05:02.800> levels<00:05:02.950> in<00:05:03.310> the<00:05:03.370> brain<00:05:03.610> so

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
acetylcholine levels in the brain so

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.340 
acetylcholine levels in the brain so
you're<00:05:04.270> going<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.450> get<00:05:04.540> more<00:05:04.630> concentration

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
you're going to get more concentration

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.000 
stimulants the pumps and the brain

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.760 
stimulants the pumps and the brain
aspect<00:05:13.630> outside<00:05:13.990> of<00:05:14.080> stimulants<00:05:14.560> you<00:05:14.680> know
