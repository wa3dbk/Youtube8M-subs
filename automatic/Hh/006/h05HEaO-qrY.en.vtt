00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.859
 hello I have a really fast studio 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.839
 I ordered a cup of stuff on 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:10.769
 internet it happened on street but in 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.200
 did I went a little searched among 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.870
 the makeup stuff really not 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.039
 dear that I could have managed to find 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.630
 and then I ordered something 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.730
 as we would like to be fifteen products 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.050
 brushes awakening stuff for 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.539
 the lips of opinions 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.900
 twenty two things then maybe a 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.119
 artist can weigh down this kind 25 well 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.550
 knew that little ping is small but no 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.130
 meaning that I have rather stuff that is 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.590
 a zero of gold for transportation and 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.140
 I received my first and my first 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:46.379
 produced in clinton makes it an identity 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.180
 who trembles like his publicity a 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.940
 pigment that I ordered 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.550
 said in the description mac pigments 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.590
 I suspected that there is one and five 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.329
 years it was not going to be mak for real 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.180
 but I told myself good shot they 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.579
 have all the colors that with manon 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.739
 that mac would have in real time that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:10.740
 finish that when we leave ni and tried 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:13.560
 I received this iej maker pigments then in 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.659
 back its marks and distributed by my 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.990
 buddies that this toronto ontario trade 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.430
 canada elsewhere and it's really the 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.710
 same kind of little boxes that I do 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.170
 usually if I bought schema 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.840
 directly except that this color loeb 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.329
 only I read in normal skin in 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.290
 compact powder that saws electric and 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.840
 where knows how to mark a red electric 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.810
 good I do not expect it either 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.390
 great thing to give fifty thousand 50 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:46.409
 days alone and I have a good little shot 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.840
 of pima mac that is perfectly like 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.990
 my jars of chilli mullet 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.079
 only I opened in which the 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:58.820
 which produces good that at the beginning there 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.659
 was sealed an open game to try 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:05.810
 and it's my faith anyway amazing the 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.239
 product quality that I have in effect 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.519
 this moment so it's a loose powder 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:16.069
 quickly like that and then really 

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:18.620
 really really spice up those stupid 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.830
 colors that I could have bought 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.840
 j mc i could have bought at home 6 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.870
 who could have bought a place 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.130
 and gps and one and 56 back in two 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:34.209
 weeks stack and even that I had a 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:38.150
 little instructional eye inside 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.319
 marc imad pigments and who explains this 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.190
 bond which is certain color that 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:45.260
 should not be used on the lips 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:47.780
 then if we want everything is really 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:51.049
 marked distributed by metropolis cosmetics 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.140
 who marks with the mac website 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:55.730
 cosmetics points like I do not know what 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:00.440
 think about it they do kisses 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:02.600
 really really effective but in short a 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.609
 frequent does that when I'm 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.650
 besides, I can tell you that I am 

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:08.930
 returned to see the seller there is 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.459

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.890
 a quality and everything but I put the link 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.140
 in the description of a video 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.690
 because for that price it's ridiculous 

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:22.790
 I have product for like three years 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.709
 Seriously the ctd pigments like that 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.620
 it's hard r it's still alive 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.269
 of excuses focus it's the turn of the screws 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.030
 sisters you can do anything 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.530
 eat that with a dimitri medium of the most 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:34.850
 strong of the game can do can be a 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.799
 little bit mature students this is like 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.600
 lidya crate a few crying that are 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.730
 not recommended tomorrow at the scene 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.400
 but a fifty groups 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.299
 the packaging is really required back 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.859

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:47.959
 back to back is when you finish and 

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:50.000
 to use mac products you can 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.790
 just as reported I think these 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.319
 May 5 years can anything from 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.970
 straight capital schemes to a red to 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.280
 lips, or a stepfather Norman tone 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:59.900
 free choice so there I really know 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.770
 I do not think I'll go to Mac's 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:01.610
 in fact directly 

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:03.290

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:05.690

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.790
 really really impressed then 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.540

 subject reviews as we are not a 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:48.290
 network and then duplicates of the readers 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.910
