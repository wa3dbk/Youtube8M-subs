growing up all in the same kind of area
and<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.729> we<00:01:53.909> had<00:01:54.060> a<00:01:54.210> lot<00:01:54.450> of<00:01:54.479> great

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659

and you know we had a lot of great
coaching<00:01:55.079> especially<00:01:55.560> with<00:01:55.680> mr.<00:01:56.130> Titanic

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
coaching especially with mr. Titanic

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
coaching especially with mr. Titanic
here<00:01:56.790> he<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:56.969> also<00:01:57.119> here<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.350> just<00:01:58.649> think

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
here he was also here and I just think

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.289 
here he was also here and I just think
something<00:01:59.430> from<00:01:59.640> that<00:01:59.759> he<00:01:59.880> really<00:02:00.030> taught<00:02:00.210> us

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
something from that he really taught us

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.999 
something from that he really taught us
the<00:02:00.540> game<00:02:00.869> at<00:02:01.049> an<00:02:01.140> early<00:02:01.350> level<00:02:01.500> so<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.829> could

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
the game at an early level so we could

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.709 
the game at an early level so we could
you<00:02:02.430> know<00:02:02.490> translate<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.329> we<00:02:03.420> got<00:02:03.540> older

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you know translate and when we got older

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.870 
you know translate and when we got older
they're<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.860> type<00:02:05.070> of<00:02:05.100> people<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.640> didn't

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
they're the type of people that didn't

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.050 
they're the type of people that didn't
need<00:02:06.560> motivation<00:02:07.560> from<00:02:07.770> outside<00:02:08.340> sources

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
need motivation from outside sources

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.500 
need motivation from outside sources
their<00:02:09.899> motivation<00:02:10.560> is<00:02:10.709> internal<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.400> I<00:02:12.150> think

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
their motivation is internal and I think

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.850 
their motivation is internal and I think
that's<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:12.900> key<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.140> their<00:02:13.440> six

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that's the key to their six

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.010 
that's the key to their six
each<00:02:14.190> one<00:02:14.490> of<00:02:14.520> them<00:02:14.700> is<00:02:14.820> driven<00:02:15.030> from<00:02:15.480> inside

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
each one of them is driven from inside

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.170 
each one of them is driven from inside
and<00:02:16.380> I<00:02:16.980> think<00:02:17.160> that's<00:02:17.340> the<00:02:17.490> greatest<00:02:17.820> lesson

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
and I think that's the greatest lesson

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.090 
and I think that's the greatest lesson
for<00:02:18.360> young<00:02:18.510> players<00:02:18.870> is<00:02:19.170> to<00:02:19.290> be<00:02:19.410> driven<00:02:19.650> from

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
for young players is to be driven from

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.670 
for young players is to be driven from
inside<00:02:20.670> yourself<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.360> each<00:02:22.320> of<00:02:22.530> these<00:02:22.620> guys

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
inside yourself and each of these guys

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.970 
inside yourself and each of these guys
has<00:02:22.890> that<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:24.180> aces<00:02:24.660> for<00:02:24.900> sure<00:02:25.110> Stamkos

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
has that in aces for sure Stamkos

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.830 
has that in aces for sure Stamkos
understands<00:02:26.640> the<00:02:26.700> expectations<00:02:27.480> associated

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840

with his number one selection and making

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.340 
with his number one selection and making
the<00:02:30.450> leap<00:02:30.600> from<00:02:30.810> junior

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
the leap from junior

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.320 
the leap from junior
however<00:02:31.830> he<00:02:32.040> insists<00:02:32.520> so<00:02:32.550> long<00:02:32.820> as<00:02:32.970> he<00:02:33.060> sticks
