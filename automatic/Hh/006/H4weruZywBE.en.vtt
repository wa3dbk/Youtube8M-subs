a thumbs up on today on this video and a
comment<00:00:33.300> about<00:00:33.530> whatever<00:00:35.239> soap<00:00:36.239> yep<00:00:36.540> that's

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
comment about whatever soap yep that's

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:38.600 
comment about whatever soap yep that's
pretty<00:00:36.930> much<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.200> what<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.190> be<00:00:38.219> said<00:00:38.489> about

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
pretty much it what could be said about

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.630 
pretty much it what could be said about
the<00:00:38.790> PDW<00:00:39.360> rate<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.230> fire<00:00:40.410> is<00:00:40.440> good<00:00:40.980> I<00:00:41.190> think

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
the PDW rate of fire is good I think

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.979 
the PDW rate of fire is good I think
it's<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:42.030> little<00:00:42.210> bit<00:00:42.360> lower<00:00:42.629> than<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> other

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it's a little bit lower than the other

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.380 
it's a little bit lower than the other
submachine<00:00:43.829> guns<00:00:44.040> but<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> makes<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.059> super

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
submachine guns but that makes it super

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.000 
submachine guns but that makes it super
easy<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.660> control<00:00:45.930> because<00:00:46.260> other<00:00:46.469> submachine

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
easy to control because other submachine

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.440 
easy to control because other submachine
guns<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.280> mean<00:00:47.430> holy<00:00:47.579> crap<00:00:47.879> especially<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
guns I mean holy crap especially the

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.630 
guns I mean holy crap especially the
Scorpion<00:00:48.870> ready<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.770> fire<00:00:50.100> up<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.489> asshole

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
Scorpion ready to fire up the asshole

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
Scorpion ready to fire up the asshole
that's<00:00:51.210> that<00:00:51.660> thing<00:00:51.870> shoots<00:00:52.199> like<00:00:52.350> its<00:00:52.530> own

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
that's that thing shoots like its own

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.549 
that's that thing shoots like its own
crack<00:00:52.920> literally<00:00:54.050> but<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.260> good<00:00:55.379> son

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
crack literally but it's a good son

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.130 
crack literally but it's a good son
machine<00:00:55.800> gun<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.039> guess<00:00:56.480> it's<00:00:57.480> the<00:00:57.629> last<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.020> be

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
machine gun I guess it's the last to be

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.130 
machine gun I guess it's the last to be
unlocked<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:59.000> as<00:01:00.000> far<00:01:00.149> as<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.329> PDW<00:01:00.870> is

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
unlocked and as far as the PDW is

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.510 
unlocked and as far as the PDW is
concerned<00:01:01.530> I<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.920> more<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.250> more<00:01:02.309> people

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
concerned I see more and more people

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
concerned I see more and more people
leaning<00:01:03.000> more<00:01:03.239> towards<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.049> guess<00:01:04.680> they<00:01:05.070> I

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
leaning more towards it I guess they I

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.280 
leaning more towards it I guess they I
mean<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.909> recall<00:01:06.180> is<00:01:06.299> manageable<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.080> when

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
mean the recall is manageable and when

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
mean the recall is manageable and when
you<00:01:07.380> slap<00:01:07.710> a<00:01:07.950> silencer<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.729> laser<00:01:08.970> it's

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
you slap a silencer and a laser it's

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.010 
you slap a silencer and a laser it's
pretty<00:01:09.510> much<00:01:10.070> you<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.189> recoilless<00:01:12.030> stealthy

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
pretty much you know recoilless stealthy

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.950 
pretty much you know recoilless stealthy
hip<00:01:13.530> fiery<00:01:13.830> gun<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.490> don't<00:01:15.299> even<00:01:15.450> think<00:01:15.600> there

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
is grip for theirs their grip for it if

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.649 
is grip for theirs their grip for it if
there<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:17.790> then<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.210> don't<00:01:18.390> need<00:01:18.479> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
now in domination it's a bit easier

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.569 
now in domination it's a bit easier
because<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.290> can<00:01:40.380> capture<00:01:40.710> flags<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.460> stuff

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
because you can capture flags and stuff

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.090 
because you can capture flags and stuff
like<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.820> but<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.750> team<00:01:42.930> deathmatch<00:01:43.079> it's<00:01:43.710> no

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
like that but in team deathmatch it's no

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.060 
like that but in team deathmatch it's no
easy<00:01:44.280> matter<00:01:44.369> that's<00:01:44.790> why<00:01:44.939> often<00:01:45.570> times<00:01:46.070> when

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
easy matter that's why often times when

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.969 
easy matter that's why often times when
i<00:01:47.130> acquire<00:01:48.110> those<00:01:49.110> high<00:01:49.320> killstreaks<00:01:49.590> and

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
i acquire those high killstreaks and

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.230 
i acquire those high killstreaks and

team deathmatches by the end of the game

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
team deathmatches by the end of the game

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
because either i die once or twice in

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.910

this<00:02:34.710> game<00:02:34.950> I<00:02:35.190> guess<00:02:36.090> all<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.420> people<00:02:36.810> that

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
this game I guess all the people that

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.480 
this game I guess all the people that
were<00:02:37.020> crying<00:02:37.350> about<00:02:37.470> snipers<00:02:37.980> not<00:02:38.160> being<00:02:38.310> one

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
were crying about snipers not being one

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.000 
were crying about snipers not being one
shot<00:02:38.730> kill<00:02:38.970> where<00:02:39.210> there<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:39.900> go<00:02:40.050> diapers<00:02:40.860> on

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
shot kill where there you go diapers on

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.070 
shot kill where there you go diapers on
now<00:02:41.130> once<00:02:41.400> you<00:02:41.520> kill<00:02:41.820> pretty<00:02:42.030> much<00:02:42.240> I<00:02:42.480> get

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
now once you kill pretty much I get

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.320 
now once you kill pretty much I get
destroyed<00:02:43.440> on<00:02:43.710> own<00:02:43.950> carrier<00:02:44.460> with<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> sniper

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
destroyed on own carrier with the sniper

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:47.330 
destroyed on own carrier with the sniper
rifles<00:02:45.870> but<00:02:46.080> I<00:02:46.290> guess<00:02:46.560> so<00:02:46.770> does<00:02:46.950> everybody

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
rifles but I guess so does everybody

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.730 
rifles but I guess so does everybody
else<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.970> actually<00:02:48.630> can't<00:02:48.959> wait<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.290> move<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.590> to

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
else I actually can't wait to move on to

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:52.210 
else I actually can't wait to move on to
the<00:02:49.830> sniper<00:02:50.070> category<00:02:50.610> so<00:02:50.790> that<00:02:50.940> I<00:02:50.970> could<00:02:51.090> use

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
the sniper category so that I could use

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.830 
the sniper category so that I could use
so<00:02:53.220> that<00:02:53.370> I<00:02:53.400> could<00:02:53.459> showcase<00:02:53.850> some<00:02:54.360> ballista

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
so that I could showcase some ballista

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.500 
so that I could showcase some ballista
action<00:02:55.230> and<00:02:55.380> maybe<00:02:55.560> the<00:02:55.770> other<00:02:56.240> what<00:02:57.240> is<00:02:57.360> that

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510 
action and maybe the other what is that

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.620 
action and maybe the other what is that
the<00:02:57.870> 50<00:02:58.200> caliber<00:02:58.410> one<00:02:58.800> weapon<00:02:59.630> that's

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
the 50 caliber one weapon that's

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.070 
the 50 caliber one weapon that's
reminiscent<00:03:01.200> of<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.830> 50<00:03:02.670> caliber<00:03:02.850> Barrett<00:03:03.360> so

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
reminiscent of the 50 caliber Barrett so

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.230 
reminiscent of the 50 caliber Barrett so
that's<00:03:04.290> pretty<00:03:04.440> cool<00:03:04.530> but<00:03:05.370> carrier<00:03:05.730> is<00:03:05.940> one<00:03:06.150> of

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
that's pretty cool but carrier is one of

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.360 
that's pretty cool but carrier is one of
