between two muscles over the first rib
and<00:00:21.499> athletes<00:00:22.499> can<00:00:22.769> get<00:00:23.009> problems<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.699> nerve

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:23.849

compression or vessel compression there

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.309 
compression or vessel compression there
because<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:26.909> use<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.239> arm<00:00:27.419> in<00:00:27.749> an<00:00:27.839> overhead

00:00:28.309 --> 00:00:28.319 
because they use the arm in an overhead

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.799 
because they use the arm in an overhead
manner<00:00:28.589> frequently<00:00:29.279> so<00:00:29.909> it's<00:00:30.239> often<00:00:30.599> a

00:00:30.799 --> 00:00:30.809 
manner frequently so it's often a

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:33.470 
manner frequently so it's often a
repetitive<00:00:31.169> motion<00:00:31.619> type<00:00:32.070> of<00:00:32.279> injury<00:00:32.640> other

in<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.460> arm<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.930> then<00:00:43.110> some<00:00:43.380> patients<00:00:43.800> have

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:43.940 
in the arm and then some patients have

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.400 
in the arm and then some patients have
anatomical<00:00:44.940> differences<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.660> an<00:00:45.810> extra<00:00:46.200> rib

outlet<00:00:51.450> syndrome<00:00:51.720> have<00:00:52.620> intrigued<00:00:53.010> me<00:00:53.220> since

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
outlet syndrome have intrigued me since

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.180 
outlet syndrome have intrigued me since
I<00:00:53.730> came<00:00:54.450> onto<00:00:54.660> the<00:00:54.870> faculty<00:00:55.320> here<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.890> I've

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
I came onto the faculty here and I've

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.190 
I came onto the faculty here and I've
developed<00:00:56.880> an<00:00:57.150> expertise<00:00:57.780> with<00:00:58.020> these

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
developed an expertise with these

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.240 
developed an expertise with these
relatively<00:00:59.070> uncommon<00:00:59.640> conditions<00:01:01.040> but<00:01:02.040> that

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
relatively uncommon conditions but that

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
relatively uncommon conditions but that
has<00:01:02.430> actually<00:01:02.850> grown<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.540> from<00:01:03.810> a<00:01:03.900> clinical

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
has actually grown and from a clinical

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.370 
has actually grown and from a clinical
practice<00:01:05.039> perspective<00:01:05.719> that's<00:01:06.719> grown<00:01:07.049> enough

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
practice perspective that's grown enough

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.590 
practice perspective that's grown enough
that<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:08.039> all<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.310> take<00:01:09.030> care<00:01:09.240> of<00:01:09.359> and

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
that now that's all I take care of and

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.709 
that now that's all I take care of and
that's<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.560> busy<00:01:10.920> clinical<00:01:11.640> practice<00:01:12.090> probably

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
that's a busy clinical practice probably

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.419 
that's a busy clinical practice probably
the<00:01:12.929> busiest<00:01:13.439> practice<00:01:14.069> in<00:01:14.189> the<00:01:14.249> country

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:14.429 
the busiest practice in the country

regarding thoracic outlet syndrome the

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.499 
regarding thoracic outlet syndrome the
other<00:01:17.340> thing<00:01:17.609> is<00:01:17.759> that<00:01:17.939> we<00:01:18.030> see<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> lot<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
other thing is that we see a lot of

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.209 
other thing is that we see a lot of
patients<00:01:18.780> who've<00:01:19.170> had<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.740> suffered<00:01:20.100> from

many other procedures or operations that
didn't<00:01:33.179> help<00:01:33.329> and<00:01:34.189> it's<00:01:35.189> still<00:01:35.579> a<00:01:35.609> thrill<00:01:35.909> for

00:01:36.169 --> 00:01:36.179 
didn't help and it's still a thrill for

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:38.209 
didn't help and it's still a thrill for
me<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.389> see<00:01:36.719> those<00:01:36.959> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.350> patients<00:01:37.829> do<00:01:37.979> well

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
me to see those kind of patients do well
