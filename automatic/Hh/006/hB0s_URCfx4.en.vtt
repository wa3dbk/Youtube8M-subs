 Hello everyone, that resource is mega review 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:08.580
 dot com for a long time we have given more 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.880
 attention to gaming peripherals 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.980
 or mobile device but about iron 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 we did not forget and prepared for you immediately 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.460
 several tests we will start with a set 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.600
 memory kingston 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.529
 savage is 2 strips of 8 gigabytes 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.789
 dual channel memory 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:29.010
 a total of 16 gigabytes with a frequency 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.920
 2400 megahertz and stands on the type of person 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.290
 not a lot is not enough 11,000 rubles worth 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.320
 here consider what is now noticeable 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.510
 grew the course and against the background of competitors it 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.860
 memory does not look much more expensive and in 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.469
 in some cases even cheaper 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 although you can pick up honestly and 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.940
 strips in such a volume cheaper but what 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.190
 here it is interesting to look at 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.750
 testing in this line includes modules 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:57.120
 4 or 8 GB memory with frequency 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 1600 1806 2133 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:03.989
 and 2400 megahertz 16 gigabytes alone seems 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.299
 optimal for working system if to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.400
 thighs you really work to 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.210
 run programs without any problems 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
 autocad for example iad premiere or those 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.900
 games, that is, just 16 gigabytes 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.310
 Now for most games, this is enough 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.229
 there is even a memory margin 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.140
 dual channel memory single strips and 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.310
 four channel set our system 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.409
 optimal support conan exactly 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.630
 so max you and precisely 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.680
 two channel pad but whatever 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.799
 option manufacturer gives life 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.820
 guarantee for this fingers 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 memory is set in a compact 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.470
 plastic blister here priests site 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.360
 perform the function of protecting it 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.460
 static electricity on the front 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.560
 parts of the label the name of the series on the sample 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 previous technical details 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.939
 characteristics on the british include 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.360
 just a quick installation guide 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.150
 memory plan for payment 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.950
 This memory Hyper iks Savich 2400 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.120
 megahertz 16 gigabytes got us 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.460
 attractive appearance 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:04.310
 flags will look good not only 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.720
 in another system but also when executed in 1 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.830
 ha that is if you just love good 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.979
 iron enthusiast 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.690
 this memory may be you interested in 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.820
 base spoil xalid black 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.730
 protected by an aluminum radiator and 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.200
 this radiator from here is warm though itself 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.750
 memory actually heats up in this 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.510
 The case is not so strong overclocking notes already 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:25.010
 there is a note of critical temperatures which 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.459
 the fireplace is sulking and the manufacturer here still 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.170
 I liked far not only the external 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.260
 part of these radiators it is painted in 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.330
 bright red color but also she design 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.750
 asymmetrical i have a little bit of such here 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.239
 intricate cutouts and at the same time 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.700
 the height of the radiator is higher just a little less 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:46.790
 three millimeters above the PCB edge 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.950
 here in our system under the radiator tube 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.500
 CPU and fan memory 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:54.050
 it became good no difficulty i don't 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.020
 noticed themselves slats runs here hand 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:03:00.110
 tight we in this case did not take off 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.700
 each of these plans has these radiators 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.860
 there is a need to do first neatly 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.900
 second you decide to just factory 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.000
 warranty and secondly you can just 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.250
 tear off pinching once on tests i 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:13.640
 point of the moment that just came off than 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:16.340
 good on each side of these slats 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.860
 soldered on eight types of companies Sgiach 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.880
 unix it works by the way at 1600 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:26.030
 megahertz consideration 135 that's good 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:28.700
 and the state hours to 2400 is our specific 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.380
 memory takes generally play will hold when 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:33.320
 this low operating temperatures 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:35.150
 there is support for xmp profile and then 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:37.430
 there are two of us can choose between 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.300
 i mean no 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.240
 noticed particular difficulty 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.040
 frequency we have frequencies of 1600 s 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.590
 tanks 1 of 11 11 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:51.000
 and what a mountain of tension one and five and 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:54.540
 two profiles one 2133 one 2400 2400 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.510
 It requires one to endure overclocking 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.670
 honest always try overclocking this 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.350
 of memory. on testing this memory 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.530
 specifically Hyper X Savich 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:07.350
 I was able to overclock to around 2600 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.540
 gigahertz but here it turned out to be rude 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.560
 tension but had to increase tomit with 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.720
 12 14 1533 had to put 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:17.160
 does it give a noticeable increase by 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.810
 new synthetic performance 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.070
 Tests have an increase but visually 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.020
 notice this difference programs 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.640
 it is possible only for example only when comparing 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.860
 example from memory 1600 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.590
 although here it also depends on 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:33.060
 In fact, from the application tests, I certainly 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.890
 I will hold that is, these graphics can 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.810
 look but here it is worth considering that 

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.150
 my specific is used here 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:42.120
 systems your system these results 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.800
 may be different in reality like me 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.930
 seems to make the best use 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:46.910
 what recommended produce 200 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.260
 thousand four hundred 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:51.419
 it's mini eleven thirteen 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.820
 fourteen voltage clothes 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:57.630
 although in a number of games you can achieve everything 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:05:00.000
 fps gain of up to five percent of the 

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:03.750
 there is traffic you can see about 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:07.230
 at least one less for example 13 versions by 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.270
 experience the difference is minimal but have 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.060
 such a stock is always good that is it 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.410
 plus these slats memory itself 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:15.150
 showed a good level 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.910
 performance stylish appearance 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:20.760
 low radiator height lack 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:23.850
 compatibility issues our memory set 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.160
 worked steadily during work problems 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.960
 not revealed memory gets reward 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.640
 gold u bori nation mega review dot com 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.590
 what can he push in this set 

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:35.790
 it is cost but here it is not only 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:37.590
 contribution from kenson herself 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.790
 go for the news ahead of us waiting 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.410
 many more many interesting 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.410
 thank you all and bye
