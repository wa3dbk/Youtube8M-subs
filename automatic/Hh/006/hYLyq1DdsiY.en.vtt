all right Riley sort of be done well
we're<00:00:08.280> tired<00:00:08.490> of<00:00:08.580> skateboards

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
we're tired of skateboards

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.620 
we're tired of skateboards
we're<00:00:09.660> tired<00:00:09.840> of<00:00:09.990> Earth<00:00:10.190> so<00:00:11.190> we're<00:00:11.340> going<00:00:11.630> to

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
we're tired of Earth so we're going to

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.320 
we're tired of Earth so we're going to
Mars<00:00:13.250> you<00:00:14.250> might<00:00:14.460> have<00:00:14.549> already<00:00:14.700> seen<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.179> made

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
Mars you might have already seen we made

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.439 
Mars you might have already seen we made
a<00:00:15.360> rocker-bogie<00:00:16.340> prototype<00:00:17.340> out<00:00:17.520> of<00:00:18.029> toy

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
a rocker-bogie prototype out of toy

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
a rocker-bogie prototype out of toy
connects<00:00:18.960> and<00:00:19.320> this<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> next<00:00:20.670> step<00:00:20.850> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
connects and this is the next step and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.880 
connects and this is the next step and
our<00:00:21.689> idea<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:23.250> is<00:00:23.310> going<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.580> be<00:00:23.670> our<00:00:24.890> dirt

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
our idea this is going to be our dirt

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.279 
our idea this is going to be our dirt
board<00:00:26.220> with<00:00:26.670> rocker-bogie<00:00:27.240> suspension<00:00:27.289> so

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
board with rocker-bogie suspension so

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:29.480 
board with rocker-bogie suspension so
we're<00:00:28.439> gonna<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.710> you<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:28.920> wheels<00:00:29.130> on<00:00:29.400> this

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
we're gonna get you the wheels on this

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.919 
we're gonna get you the wheels on this
thing<00:00:29.550> what's<00:00:30.150> it<00:00:30.300> called<00:00:30.480> David

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
thing what's it called David

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.630 
thing what's it called David
rocker-bogie<00:00:32.120> yeah<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.480> a<00:00:33.690> bogey<00:00:33.930> is<00:00:34.500> just<00:00:35.489> an

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
rocker-bogie yeah and a bogey is just an

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.290 
rocker-bogie yeah and a bogey is just an
old<00:00:35.850> word<00:00:36.210> for<00:00:36.239> truck<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:37.110> crack<00:00:37.710> and<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.040> bogey

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
old word for truck a crack and a bogey

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.400 
old word for truck a crack and a bogey
both<00:00:39.300> mean<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.170> wheel<00:00:40.559> assembly<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:41.730> oh<00:00:42.410> yeah

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
both mean a wheel assembly so oh yeah

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
both mean a wheel assembly so oh yeah
how's<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.980> type<00:00:44.129> broke<00:00:44.370> so<00:00:44.760> what<00:00:45.090> we're<00:00:45.180> gonna

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
how's it type broke so what we're gonna

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.700 
how's it type broke so what we're gonna
have<00:00:45.360> is<00:00:45.629> we're<00:00:45.750> gonna<00:00:45.840> have<00:00:45.930> a<00:00:46.050> longboard

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
have is we're gonna have a longboard

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.600 
have is we're gonna have a longboard
truck<00:00:47.039> here<00:00:47.430> with<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.030> big<00:00:48.329> long<00:00:48.539> axle<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:49.610 
truck here with this big long axle on it

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.939 
truck here with this big long axle on it
and<00:00:50.610> then<00:00:51.300> it's<00:00:51.449> gonna<00:00:51.570> have<00:00:51.660> these<00:00:51.809> big<00:00:52.289> six

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
and then it's gonna have these big six

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.750 
and then it's gonna have these big six
inch<00:00:53.219> or<00:00:53.430> 8<00:00:53.579> inch<00:00:53.610> tires<00:00:54.260> here<00:00:55.260> and<00:00:55.469> then<00:00:55.829> here

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
inch or 8 inch tires here and then here

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.099 
inch or 8 inch tires here and then here
and<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:57.930> has<00:00:57.960> six<00:00:58.410> wheels<00:00:59.219> total<00:01:00.109> and

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and here so it has six wheels total and

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.880 
and here so it has six wheels total and
how<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.410> works<00:01:02.600> is<00:01:03.600> basically<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:04.110> stand<00:01:04.739> on

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
how this works is basically you stand on

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.140 
how this works is basically you stand on
it<00:01:05.689> like<00:01:06.689> this<00:01:06.960> so<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.890> center<00:01:08.220> wheel<00:01:08.400> is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
it like this so that the center wheel is

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.289 
it like this so that the center wheel is
right<00:01:09.390> over<00:01:09.570> your<00:01:09.720> sending<00:01:10.080> of<00:01:10.140> your<00:01:10.290> mass<00:01:10.439> and

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:11.299 
right over your sending of your mass and

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:15.380 
right over your sending of your mass and
this<00:01:12.299> is<00:01:12.479> basically<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.880> it<00:01:14.880> will<00:01:15.060> it's<00:01:15.270> not

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
this is basically and it will it's not

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.240 
this is basically and it will it's not
right<00:01:15.720> now<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.110> it's<00:01:16.320> got<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> fixed<00:01:16.860> axle

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
right now because it's got a fixed axle

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.609 
right now because it's got a fixed axle
but<00:01:17.340> it's<00:01:17.460> going<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.880> be<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:18.659> very<00:01:19.170> basic

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
but it's going to be a very basic

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.160 
but it's going to be a very basic
adaptation<00:01:20.520> of<00:01:20.640> a<00:01:21.390> real<00:01:21.630> rocker-bogie

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
adaptation of a real rocker-bogie

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.100 
adaptation of a real rocker-bogie
suspension<00:01:22.200> design<00:01:23.130> which<00:01:23.640> nASA<00:01:23.970> uses<00:01:24.299> on<00:01:24.659> all

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
suspension design which nASA uses on all

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.890 
suspension design which nASA uses on all
of<00:01:25.229> its<00:01:25.380> March<00:01:26.100> Mars<00:01:26.610> rovers<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:29.900> basically

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
of its March Mars rovers and basically

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.499 
of its March Mars rovers and basically
it's<00:01:31.340> we're<00:01:32.340> gonna<00:01:32.460> see<00:01:32.700> how<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:32.850> works<00:01:33.090> for<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
it's we're gonna see how it works for a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.359 
it's we're gonna see how it works for a
board<00:01:34.049> so<00:01:34.259> what<00:01:34.380> happens<00:01:34.680> when<00:01:34.740> it<00:01:34.890> rolls<00:01:35.130> over

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
board so what happens when it rolls over

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.819 
board so what happens when it rolls over
an<00:01:35.579> obstacle<00:01:37.700> it<00:01:38.700> lifts<00:01:39.350> but<00:01:40.350> that<00:01:40.590> wheel

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
an obstacle it lifts but that wheel

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.450 
an obstacle it lifts but that wheel
remains<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:43.259> know<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.710> ground<00:01:44.009> that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
remains on the you know the ground that

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.450 
remains on the you know the ground that
it<00:01:44.549> was<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.600> as<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.259> rolls<00:01:46.500> forward<00:01:46.920> it

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
it was on and as it rolls forward it

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.889 
it was on and as it rolls forward it
could<00:01:47.700> actually<00:01:47.850> prevent<00:01:48.479> itself<00:01:48.810> from

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
could actually prevent itself from

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.389 
could actually prevent itself from
height<00:01:49.290> centering<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.939> one<00:01:51.299> thing<00:01:51.570> a

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
height centering and the one thing a

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:54.889 
height centering and the one thing a
normal<00:01:53.399> rocker-bogie<00:01:53.850> suspension<00:01:53.880> has<00:01:54.869> a

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
normal rocker-bogie suspension has a

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.590 
normal rocker-bogie suspension has a
right<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.530> a<00:01:55.860> left<00:01:56.040> here<00:01:56.700> we've<00:01:56.850> got<00:01:57.060> this

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
right and a left here we've got this

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.109 
right and a left here we've got this
solid<00:01:58.170> board<00:01:58.439> between<00:01:58.649> the<00:01:58.979> two<00:01:59.159> so<00:01:59.790> when<00:02:00.030> you

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
solid board between the two so when you

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.819 
solid board between the two so when you
lift<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.600> up<00:02:00.659> see<00:02:01.079> how<00:02:01.200> it<00:02:01.259> lifts<00:02:01.500> this<00:02:01.619> wheel

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
lift this up see how it lifts this wheel

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:02.630 
lift this up see how it lifts this wheel
up<00:02:02.009> mm-hmm

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
up mm-hmm

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.810 
up mm-hmm
well<00:02:03.119> how<00:02:03.570> we're<00:02:03.750> gonna<00:02:03.840> fix<00:02:04.170> that<00:02:04.460> is<00:02:05.460> by

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
well how we're gonna fix that is by

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.350 
well how we're gonna fix that is by
having<00:02:06.240> our<00:02:06.829> p2<00:02:07.829> kruk<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.610> back<00:02:08.759> which

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
having our p2 kruk on the back which

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.880 
having our p2 kruk on the back which
doesn't<00:02:09.810> need<00:02:09.869> resistance<00:02:10.379> and<00:02:10.619> can<00:02:10.739> just

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
doesn't need resistance and can just

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.230 
doesn't need resistance and can just
fall<00:02:11.250> and<00:02:11.640> distribute<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:12.510> weight<00:02:12.629> evenly

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.240 
fall and distribute the weight evenly

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.720 
fall and distribute the weight evenly
you'll<00:02:13.960> have<00:02:14.080> a<00:02:14.110> pivot<00:02:14.440> back<00:02:14.710> here<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.340> as<00:02:15.550> it

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
you'll have a pivot back here so as it

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.680 
you'll have a pivot back here so as it
so<00:02:16.270> it'll<00:02:16.540> be<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:18.040> we're<00:02:18.370> back<00:02:18.610> for<00:02:18.970> back<00:02:19.300> right

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
so it'll be as we're back for back right

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.020 
so it'll be as we're back for back right
and<00:02:19.840> left<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.380> middle<00:02:20.890> barrel<00:02:21.430> out<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.850> keep

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and left and middle barrel out to keep

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.720 
and left and middle barrel out to keep
to<00:02:22.210> maintain<00:02:22.600> total<00:02:23.560> even<00:02:24.370> weight

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
to maintain total even weight

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.930 
to maintain total even weight
distribution<00:02:24.940> on<00:02:25.750> all<00:02:26.230> six<00:02:27.160> wheels<00:02:27.430> on<00:02:27.790> all

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
distribution on all six wheels on all

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.180 
distribution on all six wheels on all
six<00:02:28.360> wheels<00:02:28.600> yes<00:02:28.990> so<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:29.740> is<00:02:29.860> gonna<00:02:30.010> have

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:30.190 
six wheels yes so this is gonna have

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.450 
six wheels yes so this is gonna have
some<00:02:30.400> pretty<00:02:30.610> radical<00:02:31.410> articulation<00:02:32.460> only

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:33.460 
some pretty radical articulation only

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.370 
some pretty radical articulation only
problem<00:02:33.850> is<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:35.650> goes<00:02:35.860> straight<00:02:35.980> oh<00:02:37.350> wait<00:02:38.350> a

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
problem is it goes straight oh wait a

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.740 
problem is it goes straight oh wait a
minute

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
minute

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.110 
minute
no<00:02:40.750> no<00:02:41.110> turning<00:02:41.590> so<00:02:41.770> far<00:02:42.010> but<00:02:42.160> that's<00:02:42.610> that's

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
no no turning so far but that's that's

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.650 
no no turning so far but that's that's
Phase<00:02:43.480> two<00:02:43.510> we<00:02:44.110> can<00:02:44.260> figure<00:02:44.470> out<00:02:45.270> making<00:02:46.270> it<00:02:46.390> go

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
Phase two we can figure out making it go

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.230 
Phase two we can figure out making it go
in<00:02:46.840> multiple<00:02:47.770> directions<00:02:47.860> later<00:02:48.580> and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:49.240 
in multiple directions later and

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:50.730 
in multiple directions later and
actually<00:02:49.570> it<00:02:49.720> will<00:02:49.870> turn<00:02:50.140> a<00:02:50.170> little<00:02:50.290> bit<00:02:50.620> when

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:50.740 
actually it will turn a little bit when

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.790 
actually it will turn a little bit when
we<00:02:50.830> put<00:02:50.980> a<00:02:51.010> truck<00:02:51.280> on<00:02:51.430> here<00:02:51.930> but<00:02:52.930> this<00:02:53.350> one<00:02:53.560> side

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
we put a truck on here but this one side

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.860 
we put a truck on here but this one side
won't<00:02:53.950> turn<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.310> off<00:02:54.460> and<00:02:55.180> we<00:02:55.390> could<00:02:55.570> make<00:02:55.720> that

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
won't turn it off and we could make that

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.530 
won't turn it off and we could make that
work<00:02:56.050> so<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.380> just<00:02:56.560> appears<00:02:56.860> from<00:02:57.700> from<00:02:58.330> this

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
work so it just appears from from this

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.540 
work so it just appears from from this
but<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.900> believe<00:02:59.410> that<00:02:59.440> it<00:02:59.890> will<00:03:00.070> work<00:03:00.190> best

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:00.550 
but I believe that it will work best

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.300 
but I believe that it will work best
with<00:03:01.090> this<00:03:01.300> being<00:03:01.540> the<00:03:01.780> back<00:03:01.990> and<00:03:02.950> this<00:03:03.070> being

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
with this being the back and this being

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.740 
with this being the back and this being
the<00:03:03.430> front<00:03:03.760> so<00:03:03.970> we're<00:03:04.090> gonna<00:03:04.180> try<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:04.450> see<00:03:04.690> if

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
the front so we're gonna try to see if

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.590 
the front so we're gonna try to see if
we<00:03:04.780> can<00:03:04.930> come<00:03:05.650> up<00:03:05.680> with<00:03:05.980> some<00:03:06.190> ingenious

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
we can come up with some ingenious

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.820 
we can come up with some ingenious
articulating<00:03:07.600> steering<00:03:08.140> because<00:03:08.710> I<00:03:08.770> think

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
articulating steering because I think

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.890 
articulating steering because I think
with<00:03:09.130> this<00:03:09.390> with<00:03:10.530> these<00:03:11.530> legs<00:03:12.070> um<00:03:12.660> it'll<00:03:13.660> open

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
with this with these legs um it'll open

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.480 
with this with these legs um it'll open
the<00:03:14.050> opportunity<00:03:14.650> but<00:03:14.920> it'll<00:03:15.160> bring<00:03:15.250> up<00:03:15.370> the

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:15.490 
the opportunity but it'll bring up the

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.190 
the opportunity but it'll bring up the
opportunity<00:03:15.940> to<00:03:16.060> to<00:03:16.540> explore<00:03:16.900> some

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
opportunity to to explore some

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.570 
opportunity to to explore some
interesting<00:03:17.740> means<00:03:18.220> of<00:03:18.520> steering<00:03:18.960> very<00:03:19.960> cool

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
interesting means of steering very cool

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:31.200 
interesting means of steering very cool
so<00:03:21.580> next<00:03:22.000> we'll<00:03:22.720> be<00:03:24.570> live<00:03:25.570> from<00:03:26.350> Mars<00:03:27.990> tune<00:03:28.990> in
