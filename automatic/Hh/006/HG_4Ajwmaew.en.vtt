00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
hid in touch there's all these time

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:29.450 
hid in touch there's all these time
zones<00:01:17.250> and<00:01:17.670> sweet<00:01:17.939> spots<00:01:27.619> as<00:01:28.619> a<00:01:28.680> pocket<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
zones and sweet spots as a pocket here

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.060 
zones and sweet spots as a pocket here
and<00:01:29.780> that<00:01:30.780> kind<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.079> divides<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.590> head<00:01:31.799> and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
and that kind of divides the head and

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.609 
and that kind of divides the head and
gives<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.780> places<00:01:33.780> where<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> head<00:01:34.290> is<00:01:34.320> more

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
gives you places where the head is more

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.039 
gives you places where the head is more
and<00:01:34.829> less<00:01:35.009> floppy<00:01:35.600> so<00:01:36.600> that<00:01:36.780> gives<00:01:36.900> you

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
and less floppy so that gives you

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:55.029 
and less floppy so that gives you
distinctly<00:01:37.470> different<00:01:37.710> notes

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:55.039 

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:58.340 

and<00:01:56.039> with<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.280> sensitivity<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.990> opens<00:01:58.289> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
and with this sensitivity it opens you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.440 
and with this sensitivity it opens you
up<00:01:58.380> to<00:01:58.530> use<00:01:58.890> your<00:01:59.159> frame<00:01:59.520> drum<00:01:59.819> hand<00:02:00.210> drum
