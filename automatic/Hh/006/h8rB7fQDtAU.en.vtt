00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.240
 but I am Class the country Hessen I would like in a new gates today 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.490
 something about tips and tricks are convincing Happy 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:11.020
 First of all, I want to show you how to make people human talk 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:12.879
 So one and five percent 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:15.519
 that would work with this stick figure, but it seems easy 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.519
 better if the head filled to see what marschner lances satisfied 

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.390
 lived 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.439
 FTD s 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.439
 as the next 16 no as the cross 

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:29.249
 this is not complicated or anything 

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:32.500
 but just a dash a short 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.630
 who is made a little thicker 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.650
 that will be enough 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.650
 he poses with Graber this time 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.440
 if the name just rested colorful 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.510
 that does not look very much right now 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.510
 We have to know that first 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.600
 the next one 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:55.630
 place the instant 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.130
 in front of the face it looks like a mouth 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.020
 they can do a little smaller here, it looks different 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.520
 a bit unrealistic 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.480
 more 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480
 Marcel left in screaming net 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.740
 In principle, what that is about can obviously make an animation 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.000
 really wants credit and slime and has 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.290
 inflict several frenzies 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.880
 and then the normal too 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.880
 getting bigger smaller 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.560
 keep doing what you're doing 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.440
 the DIW does not look that much after rain i guess the principle was 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.970
 clear p 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.570
 Next, I want to show how to 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.740
 the head or other body parts actually 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.310
 without the rest 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.710
 Mystic 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.920
 just Adam Port 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.920
 so services Gander of course 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.030
 here they themselves are not particularly complicated that the gaber manicures it 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.130
 will be enough 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.520
 So first delete everything except the couple we want to have so in mine 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.190
 Fall is the head 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.239
 so the farmers way wine way 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.159
 have now hurt your head 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:11.509
 that is the goal 

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.109
 Bellis headfirst 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.639
 and spells detected on airline tickets 

00:02:16.639 --> 00:02:20.489
 So politicians the segment and because the head in my parties 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.009
 not just one park consists of two 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.949
 to copy the other part too 

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:29.230
 not to the animal 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.359
 the robes too and burned 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:35.359
 after a woman that's quite funny points 

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.859
 that we can handle it 

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:45.349
 so now they just put their heads in the zoo 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:48.099
 and as already known 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.099
 the head in exactly the same order of magnitude 

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.370
 Next, I want to show you how to 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.890
 transparent percent 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:56.980
 Part of a 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.979
 Stix does 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:02.489
 Normally you can work together for everyone 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.980
 Do not stick on the right main deck to make a new one 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.849
 but I'll show you how that works without it 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:13.590
 So now I want to do this for example on the pad here 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.849
 are transparent 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.599
 This is actually quite simple 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:20.109
 All we have to do is lend to the poor and then spend a lot of time up here 

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:26.139
 Jürgen Siegmann Snap the Glasses at the dollar that is thick 0 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.609
 and if we have to go out Thieser they have to make so small 

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:34.909
 declined 

00:03:38.409 --> 00:03:39.129
 we draw 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.389
 Add custom and we see 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.439
 Parts are connected to No main part 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:47.419
 but 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.419
 are not seen in the animation 

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:55.069
 So that was so nice here to this part to Tor Jens 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:57.859
 Church or the deadline 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.679
 So these indicated on this day 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.139
 they are a Zwick 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:06.029
 Next, I want to show how to live white part on a stick and 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.579
 that will be circular 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.859
 as usual in the Andes bread I now have more black ball 

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:13.179
 just done 

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:16.259
 and suddenly have everyone's eye 

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:19.219
 Space for jazz once a circle in the lead 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:22.680
 because then it is there but now knows about 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.789
 so as to prevent that 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.159
 for him a lift agreed with the 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.469
 Leave eye to go with him she wants to have the prizes over 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:33.740
 for as long as 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.740
 how exactly the shape will have here 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.039
 for me it fits something like that for example 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:44.629
 We will then buy the animation in the example 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:47.629
 with eye 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:51.169
 tadaa and 

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:54.779
 Abenberg open eyes 

00:04:54.779 --> 00:04:58.319
 so will it be faithful to the boughs I show you still want one 

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:00.990
 many well-known Nikolai Fichtner 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.919
 so that he sticks to the back of his Kraus track 

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.250
 It's not that hard and that's it 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:10.379
 the steag just normal to the starting position that 

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:12.539
 Percent of the animation 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:16.459
 and then to extreme press so add my club and lobster 

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:19.159
 so Maier did that 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:22.159
 we find we want to stay a newly discovered height 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.229
 and how against him a bit in front 

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.629
 So put set 

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:28.930
 Which 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.849
 Whatever direction you want to move 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:33.330
 and next to the others 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.710
 SH percent Dekkers in the Alps 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.529
 Kahler squeezed 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:39.279
 Make it to 10 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.279
 Brighter 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:46.909
 thereupon 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:50.019
 "Take as the WEMF percent Freeman new stick in the lead 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:54.259
 We will ask them to demand 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:58.469
 with the media 

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.300
 percent 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.349
 very old plug 

00:06:01.349 --> 00:06:03.319
 let's take the colors 

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:06.319
 still do 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.030
 next to the 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:10.759
 from the last France fat 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:14.020
 after a bit lighter 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.139
 and mares nothing strange again 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:19.580
 and percent that I'm on it as it becomes faster Zeller 

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:22.289
 Of course you can also search 

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.789
 and around 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:27.259
 Let's go on 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:30.029
 I'll move on a bit 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:31.249
 as well 

00:06:31.249 --> 00:06:33.749
 then again as usual 

00:06:33.749 --> 00:06:36.749
 make everything a bit lighter 

00:06:41.969 --> 00:06:44.969
 for nix files effect you can also order 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:52.430
 If you can also have Switzerland you can store it now 

00:06:52.429 --> 00:06:55.429
 but not there is also percent we can do too 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:00.020
 deprived of a figure again 

00:07:02.559 --> 00:07:05.559
 and they have that now 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:07.770
 move in relatively 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:09.629
 he does that with percent 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:12.629
 until the prefect on announcements 

00:07:13.969 --> 00:07:17.009
 and 

00:07:17.009 --> 00:07:20.729
 So as I said, of course, step and as far as everything can vary freely 

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.119
 so 

00:07:24.119 --> 00:07:27.539
 This will be easier for me now too expensive 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:29.029
 lower your eyes here 

00:07:29.029 --> 00:07:31.490
 if I would continue now 

00:07:31.490 --> 00:07:34.680
 then Pröll there would be a nice place effects 

00:07:35.749 --> 00:07:38.679
 and if he has her all his national team and much more 

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:39.069
 No
