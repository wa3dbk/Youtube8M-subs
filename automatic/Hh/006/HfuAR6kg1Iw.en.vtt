going to see and I'm also going to go
over<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:11.150> CT<00:00:12.150> scans<00:00:12.480> and<00:00:12.780> go<00:00:13.139> over<00:00:13.259> the

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
over some CT scans and go over the

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.770 
over some CT scans and go over the
muscles<00:00:13.769> of<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> eye<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.790> bones<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.750> eye

and read some of this stuff for you so
let's<00:00:18.180> go<00:00:18.270> ahead<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.480> get<00:00:18.539> started<00:00:18.779> with<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
let's go ahead and get started with the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.800 
let's go ahead and get started with the
basics<00:00:20.660> which<00:00:21.660> would<00:00:21.840> be<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.140> external<00:00:22.800> exam

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:23.810 
basics which would be the external exam

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:25.609 
basics which would be the external exam
now<00:00:24.810> the<00:00:24.869> first<00:00:25.140> thing<00:00:25.260> you're<00:00:25.350> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.500> see

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
now the first thing you're going to see

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.400 
now the first thing you're going to see
in<00:00:25.800> an<00:00:25.890> exam<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.580> the<00:00:26.760> conjunctiva<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
in an exam is the conjunctiva and the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.109 
in an exam is the conjunctiva and the
conjunctiva<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:29.580> layer<00:00:29.820> of<00:00:29.910> tissue

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
conjunctiva is just a layer of tissue

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.930 
conjunctiva is just a layer of tissue
that<00:00:30.480> sits<00:00:30.810> on<00:00:31.050> top<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.560> eye<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:32.009> it's

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that sits on top of the eye and it's

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.420 
that sits on top of the eye and it's
clear<00:00:33.420> and<00:00:33.570> it<00:00:34.260> sits<00:00:34.469> right<00:00:34.590> here<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
clear and it sits right here on the

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.410 
clear and it sits right here on the
white<00:00:35.610> part<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:35.940> eye<00:00:36.030> now<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
white part of the eye now the

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.330 
white part of the eye now the
conjunctiva<00:00:37.200> is<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.410> white<00:00:37.649> it's<00:00:38.010> clear

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
conjunctiva is not white it's clear

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.770 
conjunctiva is not white it's clear
you're<00:00:38.820> seeing<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.180> white<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.660> eye

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
you're seeing the white of the eye

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.229 
you're seeing the white of the eye
underneath<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.489> conjunctiva<00:00:42.059> is<00:00:42.090> a

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
underneath and the conjunctiva is a

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.850 
underneath and the conjunctiva is a
layer<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.780> tissue<00:00:42.930> that<00:00:43.260> protects<00:00:43.649> the<00:00:43.829> eye

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
layer of tissue that protects the eye

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.959 
layer of tissue that protects the eye
and<00:00:44.250> also<00:00:45.180> creates<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.930> surface<00:00:46.579> underneath<00:00:47.579> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
and also creates a surface underneath it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:49.760 
and also creates a surface underneath it
actually<00:00:48.300> loops<00:00:48.570> underneath<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.260> inside<00:00:49.649> of

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
actually loops underneath the inside of

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
actually loops underneath the inside of
the<00:00:49.829> eyelid<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.460> forms<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.390> back<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
the eyelid and forms the back of the

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.069 
the eyelid and forms the back of the
eyelids<00:00:52.320> here<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.940> explains<00:00:53.940> why<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.570> you<00:00:54.870> say

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
eyelids here and explains why if you say

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.560 
eyelids here and explains why if you say
have<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.289> contact<00:00:55.710> lens<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.309> slips<00:00:57.059> down<00:00:57.270> why

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
have a contact lens that slips down why

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.599 
have a contact lens that slips down why
doesn't<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:57.989> behind<00:00:58.320> your<00:00:58.410> eyeball<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:59.129> gets

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
doesn't go behind your eyeball it gets

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
doesn't go behind your eyeball it gets
trapped<00:00:59.910> by<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> conjunctiva<00:01:00.840> here<00:01:01.170> and

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
trapped by the conjunctiva here and

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.549 
trapped by the conjunctiva here and
people<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.070> get<00:01:02.219> conjunctivitis<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:03.559 
people that get conjunctivitis can a

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.370 
people that get conjunctivitis can a
infection<00:01:04.559> of<00:01:04.920> this<00:01:05.430> layer<00:01:05.640> of<00:01:05.729> tissue<00:01:06.380> now

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
infection of this layer of tissue now

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.380 
infection of this layer of tissue now
the<00:01:07.439> conjunctiva<00:01:08.100> actually<00:01:08.909> inserts<00:01:09.240> right

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
the conjunctiva actually inserts right

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.510 
the conjunctiva actually inserts right
here<00:01:09.689> at<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.900> limbus<00:01:10.260> where<00:01:11.159> it<00:01:11.280> becomes

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
here at the limbus where it becomes

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.179 
here at the limbus where it becomes
clear<00:01:11.820> cornea<00:01:12.290> that's<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.860> front<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
clear cornea that's the the front of the

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.770 
clear cornea that's the the front of the
eye<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.400> course<00:01:14.640> and<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.390> take<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> picture

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
eye of course and if we take a picture

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.999 
eye of course and if we take a picture
of<00:01:16.020> this<00:01:16.140> we<00:01:16.470> see<00:01:16.799> here's<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> limbus<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:19.009> the

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
of this we see here's the limbus and the

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.249 
of this we see here's the limbus and the
conjunctiva<00:01:20.670> is<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.880> thin<00:01:21.750> layer<00:01:22.049> of<00:01:22.080> tissue

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
conjunctiva is a thin layer of tissue

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.170 
conjunctiva is a thin layer of tissue
here<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> there's<00:01:23.580> actually<00:01:23.820> little<00:01:23.880> blood

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
here and there's actually little blood

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.700 
here and there's actually little blood
vessels<00:01:24.570> running<00:01:24.780> through<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> conjunctiva

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
vessels running through the conjunctiva

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.499 
vessels running through the conjunctiva
and<00:01:25.920> when<00:01:26.220> you<00:01:26.280> get<00:01:26.369> say<00:01:26.610> a<00:01:26.640> conjunctivitis

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
and when you get say a conjunctivitis

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.539 
and when you get say a conjunctivitis
these<00:01:28.140> blood<00:01:28.409> vessels<00:01:28.439> will<00:01:28.860> dilate<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.460> get

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
these blood vessels will dilate and get

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.460 
these blood vessels will dilate and get
very<00:01:29.729> red<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.210> that's<00:01:30.689> why<00:01:30.930> your<00:01:31.079> eyelids

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
very red and that's why your eyelids

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.240 
very red and that's why your eyelids
pink<00:01:32.390> now<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.450> eyelids<00:01:33.990> are<00:01:34.229> actually<00:01:34.619> formed

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
pink now the eyelids are actually formed

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.190 
pink now the eyelids are actually formed
by<00:01:35.430> you<00:01:36.090> could<00:01:36.240> really<00:01:36.509> break<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.780> down<00:01:36.900> into

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
by you could really break it down into

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
by you could really break it down into
two<00:01:37.439> layers<00:01:37.680> there's<00:01:38.130> an<00:01:38.280> anterior<00:01:38.729> lamella

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
two layers there's an anterior lamella

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.300 
two layers there's an anterior lamella
which<00:01:39.420> has<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:40.530> muscles<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.159> things

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
which has the the muscles and things

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.719 
which has the the muscles and things
like<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
like that

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.910 
like that
and<00:01:41.939> there's<00:01:42.390> a<00:01:42.450> posterior<00:01:42.899> lamella<00:01:43.320> which<00:01:43.710> is

the tears and this oil is real important

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.170 
the tears and this oil is real important
to<00:02:28.860> keep<00:02:29.040> the<00:02:29.130> tears<00:02:29.370> from<00:02:29.490> evaporating<00:02:29.970> too

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
to keep the tears from evaporating too

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.760 
to keep the tears from evaporating too
quickly<00:02:30.420> a<00:02:32.180> collision<00:02:33.180> can<00:02:33.570> occur<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:34.140> one<00:02:34.710> of

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:34.770 
quickly a collision can occur if one of

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:37.130 
quickly a collision can occur if one of

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
those little pores is clogged up you can

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.530 
those little pores is clogged up you can
get<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> backflow<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.830> lipid<00:02:38.580> into<00:02:38.880> the<00:02:39.060> gland

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
get a backflow of lipid into the gland

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.260 
get a backflow of lipid into the gland
and<00:02:39.870> you<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.650> get<00:02:40.770> a<00:02:40.860> granulomatous<00:02:41.670> reaction

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
and you can get a granulomatous reaction

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.380 
and you can get a granulomatous reaction
it's<00:02:42.930> not<00:02:43.140> an<00:02:43.290> infection<00:02:43.760> but<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.240> is

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
it's not an infection but it is

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.790 
it's not an infection but it is
something<00:02:45.600> we<00:02:45.780> see<00:02:45.960> quite<00:02:46.080> commonly<00:02:46.530> in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
something we see quite commonly in

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.110 
something we see quite commonly in
ophthalmology<00:02:47.070> it's<00:02:47.760> one<00:02:47.940> of<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
ophthalmology it's one of the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.360 
ophthalmology it's one of the
bread-and-butter<00:02:48.810> things<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.800> we<00:02:49.890> see<00:02:50.160> and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
bread-and-butter things that we see and

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.110 
bread-and-butter things that we see and
people<00:02:50.940> have<00:02:51.300> a<00:02:52.070> hard<00:02:53.070> lump<00:02:53.370> on<00:02:53.610> their<00:02:53.730> eyelid

people have a hard lump on their eyelid

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.750 
people have a hard lump on their eyelid
it's<00:02:54.540> not<00:02:54.720> tender<00:02:55.140> it's<00:02:55.320> not<00:02:55.470> infected<00:02:56.040> but

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it's not tender it's not infected but

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.340 
it's not tender it's not infected but
they<00:02:57.150> usually<00:02:57.270> won't<00:02:57.570> go<00:02:57.750> away<00:02:57.870> on<00:02:58.050> their<00:02:58.290> own

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
they usually won't go away on their own

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.290 
they usually won't go away on their own
and<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:59.220> have<00:02:59.370> to<00:02:59.459> actually<00:02:59.700> flip<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.030> eyelid

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
and we have to actually flip the eyelid

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.800 
and we have to actually flip the eyelid
over<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.780> use<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:01.790> scalpel<00:03:02.790> to<00:03:03.150> incise

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
over and use a little scalpel to incise

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.410 
over and use a little scalpel to incise
and<00:03:04.080> drain<00:03:04.260> these<00:03:04.410> things<00:03:05.060> now<00:03:06.060> that's<00:03:06.240> much

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
and drain these things now that's much

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.030 
and drain these things now that's much
different<00:03:06.750> than<00:03:06.810> a<00:03:06.900> stai<00:03:07.170> which<00:03:07.530> is<00:03:07.680> more<00:03:07.830> like

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
different than a stai which is more like

different than a stai which is more like
a<00:03:08.250> pimple<00:03:08.700> it's<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.030> little<00:03:09.270> small<00:03:09.900> localized

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
a hard time closing their eye and that

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.970 
a hard time closing their eye and that
can<00:03:38.519> create<00:03:38.670> a<00:03:38.820> lot<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.030> exposure<00:03:39.480> problems

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980

pulls the eye open and if you have a
cranial<00:03:56.910> nerve<00:03:57.030> three<00:03:57.060> palsy<00:03:57.780> then<00:03:58.260> these

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
cranial nerve three palsy then these

eye<00:04:01.290> the<00:04:02.190> mnemonic<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:02.760> use<00:04:02.940> to<00:04:03.209> remember<00:04:03.360> what

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:03.690 
eye the mnemonic I use to remember what

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.390 
eye the mnemonic I use to remember what
nerve<00:04:03.900> does<00:04:04.140> what<00:04:04.410> is<00:04:04.620> cranial<00:04:05.190> nerve<00:04:05.340> three

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400

nerve does what is cranial nerve three
opens<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.180> eye<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.480> you<00:04:06.570> can<00:04:06.690> think<00:04:06.870> of<00:04:06.959> that

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:07.110 
opens the eye and you can think of that

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:09.530 
opens the eye and you can think of that
like<00:04:07.260> a<00:04:07.290> three<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.830> a<00:04:07.860> pillar<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.540> cranial

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
nerve seven closes the eye and you can

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.800 
nerve seven closes the eye and you can
think<00:04:11.730> of<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:11.910> like<00:04:12.180> a<00:04:12.230> fishhook<00:04:14.810> the

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:15.810 
think of that like a fishhook the

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:18.259 
think of that like a fishhook the
lacrimal<00:04:16.320> system<00:04:16.500> controls<00:04:17.070> the<00:04:17.609> tears<00:04:17.940> and

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
lacrimal system controls the tears and

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.599 
lacrimal system controls the tears and

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
the tear drainage now look the majority

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:22.330 
the tear drainage now look the majority
of<00:04:20.640> tears<00:04:20.880> are<00:04:21.030> actually<00:04:21.330> produced<00:04:22.049> by

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
of tears are actually produced by

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.480 
of tears are actually produced by

produced by the lacrimal gland up here

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:34.040 
produced by the lacrimal gland up here
in<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.220> corner<00:04:32.580> which<00:04:33.060> scores<00:04:33.420> tears<00:04:33.780> into

the tear film here that tears then are

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.430 
the tear film here that tears then are

of one of them here's another patient
this<00:05:08.850> one's<00:05:09.090> a<00:05:09.180> little<00:05:09.240> bit<00:05:09.420> more<00:05:09.570> obvious<00:05:09.720> now

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:10.110 
this one's a little bit more obvious now

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:11.720 
this one's a little bit more obvious now
people<00:05:10.380> have<00:05:10.500> different<00:05:10.800> size<00:05:11.010> of<00:05:11.310> punctum

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
people have different size of punctum

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:14.540 
people have different size of punctum
sometimes<00:05:12.210> they<00:05:12.540> don't<00:05:12.630> have<00:05:12.840> punctum<00:05:13.550> people

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:14.550 
sometimes they don't have punctum people

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:15.950 
sometimes they don't have punctum people
who<00:05:14.640> have<00:05:14.760> chronic<00:05:15.000> dry<00:05:15.360> eyes<00:05:15.570> we<00:05:15.840> can

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
who have chronic dry eyes we can

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.750 
who have chronic dry eyes we can
actually<00:05:16.110> put<00:05:16.740> a<00:05:16.770> little<00:05:16.890> plug<00:05:17.190> inside<00:05:17.640> of

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
actually put a little plug inside of

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.930 
actually put a little plug inside of
this<00:05:17.850> thing<00:05:18.090> and<00:05:19.310> that<00:05:20.310> way<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.550> tears<00:05:20.790> don't

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:20.940 
this thing and that way the tears don't

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:22.250 
this thing and that way the tears don't
drain<00:05:21.210> too<00:05:21.360> quickly<00:05:21.630> and<00:05:21.840> that<00:05:21.930> seems<00:05:22.170> to

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:22.260 
drain too quickly and that seems to

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:25.280 
drain too quickly and that seems to
alleviate<00:05:22.710> a<00:05:22.920> lot<00:05:23.430> of<00:05:23.520> their<00:05:23.610> symptoms<00:05:24.290> here's

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
alleviate a lot of their symptoms here's

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:27.140 
alleviate a lot of their symptoms here's
a<00:05:25.380> patient<00:05:25.560> had<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:25.920> odd<00:05:26.070> the<00:05:26.430> opposite<00:05:26.940> she

00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:27.150 
a patient had the odd the opposite she

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.570 
a patient had the odd the opposite she
came<00:05:27.330> in<00:05:27.510> complaining<00:05:27.660> of<00:05:28.050> tearing<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.710> under

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
came in complaining of tearing and under

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:30.950 
came in complaining of tearing and under
exam<00:05:29.850> you<00:05:30.000> can<00:05:30.060> see<00:05:30.240> that<00:05:30.360> she<00:05:30.450> has<00:05:30.540> an<00:05:30.660> eyelash

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960 
exam you can see that she has an eyelash

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.500 
exam you can see that she has an eyelash
that's<00:05:31.260> actually<00:05:31.500> stuck<00:05:31.940> and<00:05:32.940> they<00:05:33.240> punked

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
that's actually stuck and they punked

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.270 
that's actually stuck and they punked
him<00:05:33.600> on<00:05:33.720> that<00:05:33.870> side<00:05:34.110> so<00:05:34.830> I<00:05:34.890> just<00:05:35.010> pulled<00:05:35.220> that

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
him on that side so I just pulled that

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.680 
him on that side so I just pulled that
out<00:05:35.370> and<00:05:35.730> her<00:05:35.940> symptoms<00:05:36.270> went<00:05:36.570> away<00:05:38.600> here's<00:05:39.600> an

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:39.690 
out and her symptoms went away here's an

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:41.210 
out and her symptoms went away here's an
axial<00:05:40.110> CT<00:05:40.440> I<00:05:40.470> wanted<00:05:40.800> to<00:05:40.860> show<00:05:41.010> you<00:05:41.100> this

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
axial CT I wanted to show you this

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:44.510 
axial CT I wanted to show you this
because<00:05:41.669> the<00:05:41.960> the<00:05:42.960> tears<00:05:43.650> from<00:05:43.830> the<00:05:43.950> eye<00:05:43.980> drain

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:44.520 
because the the tears from the eye drain

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.159 
because the the tears from the eye drain
into<00:05:44.850> the<00:05:44.970> nose<00:05:45.210> and<00:05:45.240> they<00:05:45.570> drain<00:05:45.810> down<00:05:46.020> the

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:46.169 
into the nose and they drain down the

00:05:46.169 --> 00:05:48.620 
into the nose and they drain down the
nasolacrimal<00:05:46.590> duct<00:05:47.100> and<00:05:47.370> if<00:05:48.090> we<00:05:48.240> start<00:05:48.510> up

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:48.630 
nasolacrimal duct and if we start up

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.680 
nasolacrimal duct and if we start up
here<00:05:48.660> at<00:05:48.900> the<00:05:48.990> eye<00:05:49.020> and<00:05:50.150> move<00:05:51.150> our<00:05:51.330> way<00:05:51.450> down

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:51.690 
here at the eye and move our way down

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:54.530 
here at the eye and move our way down
this<00:05:52.050> is<00:05:52.110> right<00:05:52.470> here<00:05:53.330> immediately<00:05:54.330> and

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:54.540 
this is right here immediately and

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.720 
this is right here immediately and
follow<00:05:55.470> this<00:05:55.620> down<00:05:55.830> you<00:05:56.160> can<00:05:56.280> actually<00:05:56.430> see<00:05:56.700> a

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:56.730 
follow this down you can actually see a

00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:58.100 
follow this down you can actually see a
little<00:05:56.850> hole<00:05:57.060> here<00:05:57.120> and<00:05:57.540> that's<00:05:57.960> the

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
little hole here and that's the

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.080 
little hole here and that's the
nasolacrimal<00:05:58.500> duct<00:05:59.010> just<00:05:59.430> a<00:05:59.520> little<00:05:59.760> circle

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
nasolacrimal duct just a little circle

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.840 
nasolacrimal duct just a little circle
and<00:06:00.270> as<00:06:01.200> you<00:06:01.320> go<00:06:01.470> down<00:06:01.620> it<00:06:01.890> drains<00:06:02.190> into<00:06:02.430> the

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:02.850 
and as you go down it drains into the

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:04.220 
and as you go down it drains into the
nose<00:06:03.030> and<00:06:03.300> here<00:06:03.450> it<00:06:03.510> is<00:06:03.600> draining<00:06:03.990> into<00:06:04.110> the

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:04.230 
nose and here it is draining into the

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:06.650 
nose and here it is draining into the
nose<00:06:04.640> you<00:06:05.640> can<00:06:05.669> imagine<00:06:05.880> if<00:06:06.180> someone<00:06:06.360> has<00:06:06.630> a

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:06.660 
nose you can imagine if someone has a

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:09.800 
nose you can imagine if someone has a
lot<00:06:06.990> of<00:06:07.050> facial<00:06:07.830> fractures<00:06:08.370> or<00:06:08.630> some<00:06:09.630> type<00:06:09.780> of

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
lot of facial fractures or some type of

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.840 
lot of facial fractures or some type of
disjoin<00:06:10.200> assess<00:06:10.470> of<00:06:10.620> the<00:06:10.680> bones<00:06:10.890> that<00:06:11.610> this

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
disjoin assess of the bones that this

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.390 
disjoin assess of the bones that this
could<00:06:12.150> be<00:06:12.330> could<00:06:13.020> be<00:06:13.050> broken<00:06:13.560> and<00:06:13.710> that<00:06:14.220> can

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
could be could be broken and that can

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.750 
could be could be broken and that can
cause<00:06:14.520> a<00:06:14.550> lot<00:06:14.760> of<00:06:14.790> problems<00:06:15.240> with<00:06:15.390> tearing<00:06:15.840> if

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:16.760 
cause a lot of problems with tearing if

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:20.560 
cause a lot of problems with tearing if
you<00:06:17.760> do<00:06:17.910> have<00:06:18.090> a<00:06:18.350> lid<00:06:19.350> laceration<00:06:19.980> the<00:06:20.070> most

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:20.570 
you do have a lid laceration the most

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:22.760 
you do have a lid laceration the most
worrisome<00:06:21.570> area<00:06:21.930> really<00:06:22.230> is<00:06:22.350> immediately

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:22.770 
worrisome area really is immediately

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:24.200 
worrisome area really is immediately
because<00:06:23.160> you<00:06:23.280> can<00:06:23.400> cut<00:06:23.790> right<00:06:23.820> through<00:06:24.000> the

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:24.210 
because you can cut right through the

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:27.620 
because you can cut right through the
Kinney<00:06:24.480> littler<00:06:25.550> structures<00:06:26.550> and<00:06:26.760> this<00:06:27.450> needs

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:27.630 
Kinney littler structures and this needs

00:06:27.630 --> 00:06:30.020 
Kinney littler structures and this needs
to<00:06:27.690> be<00:06:27.840> repaired<00:06:28.320> surgically<00:06:28.770> where<00:06:29.040> we<00:06:29.160> will

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
to be repaired surgically where we will

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.270 
to be repaired surgically where we will
actually<00:06:30.270> run<00:06:30.419> a<00:06:30.480> tube<00:06:30.810> through<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.890> system

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
actually run a tube through the system

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.610 
actually run a tube through the system
and<00:06:32.540> leave<00:06:33.540> that<00:06:33.720> tube<00:06:33.900> there<00:06:34.140> for<00:06:34.320> a<00:06:34.350> while

00:06:34.610 --> 00:06:34.620 
and leave that tube there for a while

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.020 
and leave that tube there for a while
everything<00:06:34.740> heals<00:06:35.190> up<00:06:35.340> around<00:06:35.669> it<00:06:35.850> in<00:06:35.940> order

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
everything heals up around it in order

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:39.560 
everything heals up around it in order
to<00:06:36.120> keep<00:06:36.300> this<00:06:36.479> this<00:06:36.990> drainage<00:06:37.460> paitent<00:06:38.570> well

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:39.570 
to keep this this drainage paitent well

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:40.760 
to keep this this drainage paitent well
let's<00:06:39.750> go<00:06:39.840> onto<00:06:39.960> the<00:06:40.110> globe<00:06:40.350> because<00:06:40.530> that's

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
let's go onto the globe because that's

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.290 
let's go onto the globe because that's
what<00:06:40.890> we're

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 
what we're

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:42.760 
what we're
going<00:06:41.389> to<00:06:41.449> be<00:06:41.509> talking<00:06:41.870> about<00:06:41.900> for<00:06:42.530> the<00:06:42.620> most

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:42.770 
going to be talking about for the most

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:45.789 
going to be talking about for the most
part<00:06:43.069> the
