bit cuts not if you upgrade and start
grading<00:05:23.880> in<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.300> hub<00:05:25.159> because<00:05:26.159> you<00:05:26.310> are

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
grading in the hub because you are

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.969 
grading in the hub because you are
getting<00:05:26.880> rid<00:05:27.000> of<00:05:27.030> a<00:05:27.120> weak<00:05:27.300> point<00:05:27.770> you<00:05:28.770> need

00:05:28.969 --> 00:05:28.979 
getting rid of a weak point you need

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:31.129 
getting rid of a weak point you need
weak<00:05:29.220> points<00:05:29.639> because<00:05:30.510> they're<00:05:30.690> ones<00:05:30.960> that

00:05:31.129 --> 00:05:31.139 
weak points because they're ones that

00:05:31.139 --> 00:05:33.500 
weak points because they're ones that
break<00:05:31.320> if<00:05:31.979> you<00:05:32.159> make<00:05:32.370> the<00:05:33.030> one<00:05:33.180> that<00:05:33.330> doesn't

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:33.510 
break if you make the one that doesn't

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:35.770 
break if you make the one that doesn't
break<00:05:33.750> if<00:05:34.500> you<00:05:34.560> make<00:05:34.770> it<00:05:34.919> so<00:05:35.070> it<00:05:35.190> doesn't<00:05:35.370> break

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
break if you make it so it doesn't break

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.950 
break if you make it so it doesn't break
then<00:05:37.760> you<00:05:38.760> more<00:05:39.240> likely<00:05:39.419> to<00:05:39.510> break<00:05:39.690> something

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:39.960 
then you more likely to break something

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:42.580 
then you more likely to break something
else<00:05:40.669> something's<00:05:41.669> gonna<00:05:41.880> break<00:05:42.030> eventually

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
else something's gonna break eventually

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.100 
else something's gonna break eventually
if<00:05:43.590> your<00:05:44.130> weakest<00:05:44.550> point<00:05:44.610> is<00:05:45.360> your<00:05:45.630> axle

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
if your weakest point is your axle

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.020 
if your weakest point is your axle
because<00:05:46.830> you've<00:05:47.159> upgraded<00:05:47.340> everything<00:05:47.880> else

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030 
because you've upgraded everything else

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:49.730 
because you've upgraded everything else
then<00:05:48.360> your<00:05:48.479> axles<00:05:48.750> gonna<00:05:48.900> break<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.590> might

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
then your axles gonna break that might

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.189 
then your axles gonna break that might
be<00:05:49.830> more<00:05:49.949> expensive<00:05:50.250> long<00:05:50.729> run

00:05:51.189 --> 00:05:51.199 
be more expensive long run

00:05:51.199 --> 00:05:54.740 
be more expensive long run
so<00:05:52.199> I<00:05:52.260> recommend<00:05:52.530> keeping<00:05:52.830> on<00:05:53.099> stock<00:05:53.639> what<00:05:54.599> are

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750 
so I recommend keeping on stock what are

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.610 
so I recommend keeping on stock what are
they<00:05:55.080> this<00:05:55.289> is<00:05:55.349> an<00:05:55.620> issue<00:05:56.659> they've<00:05:57.659> got<00:05:57.930> up<00:05:58.139> we

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620 
they this is an issue they've got up we

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.689 
they this is an issue they've got up we
can<00:05:58.800> see<00:05:58.949> this<00:06:00.860> little<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:02.130> gears<00:06:02.370> are

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:02.699 
can see this little the gears are

00:06:02.699 --> 00:06:05.089 
can see this little the gears are
completely<00:06:03.180> open<00:06:03.330> I<00:06:03.750> have<00:06:04.440> caught<00:06:04.680> my<00:06:04.800> finger

00:06:05.089 --> 00:06:05.099 
completely open I have caught my finger

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:08.089 
completely open I have caught my finger
in<00:06:05.159> that<00:06:05.190> and<00:06:05.960> either<00:06:06.960> throttle<00:06:07.530> ain't<00:06:07.770> hurts

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
in that and either throttle ain't hurts

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.820 
in that and either throttle ain't hurts
you<00:06:09.000> can<00:06:09.240> get<00:06:09.419> rocks<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:09.870> sound<00:06:10.110> and<00:06:10.409> dirt<00:06:10.590> in

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
you can get rocks and sound and dirt in

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.709 
you can get rocks and sound and dirt in
there<00:06:10.979> and<00:06:11.159> that<00:06:11.250> will<00:06:11.370> damage<00:06:11.610> them<00:06:11.820> a<00:06:12.029> lot<00:06:12.659> of

00:06:12.709 --> 00:06:12.719 
there and that will damage them a lot of

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:14.020 
there and that will damage them a lot of
damage<00:06:13.050> to<00:06:13.320> them

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.030 
damage to them

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:16.600 
damage to them
but<00:06:14.330> it's<00:06:15.140> quite<00:06:15.320> dangerous<00:06:15.770> if<00:06:16.100> you<00:06:16.370> get<00:06:16.520> you

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
but it's quite dangerous if you get you

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:18.700 
but it's quite dangerous if you get you
only<00:06:16.760> that<00:06:16.910> it<00:06:17.120> does<00:06:17.330> hurt<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.810> does<00:06:17.930> rip

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
only that it does hurt and it does rip

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.670 
only that it does hurt and it does rip
skin<00:06:18.980> and<00:06:19.190> you<00:06:19.280> could<00:06:19.430> get<00:06:19.610> an<00:06:19.670> infection

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
skin and you could get an infection

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.530 
skin and you could get an infection
everything<00:06:21.680> and<00:06:21.950> then<00:06:22.880> these<00:06:23.030> would<00:06:23.240> not<00:06:23.360> work

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:23.540 
everything and then these would not work

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:24.850 
everything and then these would not work
and<00:06:23.690> then<00:06:23.810> you'd<00:06:23.960> have<00:06:24.050> to<00:06:24.110> replace<00:06:24.380> them<00:06:24.680> I

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:24.860 
and then you'd have to replace them I

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.690 
and then you'd have to replace them I
would<00:06:25.070> cost<00:06:25.280> more<00:06:25.840> so<00:06:26.840> it's<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:27.860> not<00:06:28.550> to

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:28.700 
would cost more so it's just not to

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:32.830 
would cost more so it's just not to
occupy<00:06:28.970> but<00:06:29.360> it's<00:06:29.510> fine<00:06:31.270> that's<00:06:32.270> it<00:06:32.510> for<00:06:32.630> today

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:32.840 
occupy but it's fine that's it for today

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:35.230 
occupy but it's fine that's it for today
thank<00:06:33.170> you
