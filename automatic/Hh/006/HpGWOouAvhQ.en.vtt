nothing wrong with it at all and
remember<00:03:21.180> it<00:03:22.180> was<00:03:22.420> still<00:03:22.690> need<00:03:22.870> use<00:03:23.200> until

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.800 

1970<00:03:29.320> something<00:03:29.709> and<00:03:30.430> it'll<00:03:31.209> be<00:03:31.330> introduced

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
1970 something and it'll be introduced

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.949 
1970 something and it'll be introduced
when<00:03:32.020> Wednesday's<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.560> ball<00:03:32.920> or<00:03:33.959> very

when Wednesday's the ball or very
available<00:03:35.560> you<00:03:36.550> know<00:03:36.700> it's<00:03:37.150> rifled<00:03:37.989> and

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:38.580 
available you know it's rifled and

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.360 
available you know it's rifled and
that's<00:03:39.580> with<00:03:39.850> two<00:03:39.880> and<00:03:40.330> a<00:03:40.420> quarter<00:03:40.660> tones<00:03:41.370> the

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
that's with two and a quarter tones the

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.220 
that's with two and a quarter tones the

rifle II aside rifle e a barrel gives

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.520 
rifle II aside rifle e a barrel gives
spin<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.940> accuracy<00:03:48.940> and<00:03:49.150> in<00:03:49.930> fact<00:03:50.110> improves

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
spin and accuracy and in fact improves

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.490 
spin and accuracy and in fact improves
the<00:03:50.680> speed<00:03:50.980> if<00:03:51.580> you<00:03:52.420> have<00:03:52.660> a<00:03:52.690> none<00:03:52.959> rifle

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500 
the speed if you have a none rifle

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.090 
the speed if you have a none rifle
barrel<00:03:54.209> inevitably<00:03:55.209> the<00:03:55.420> shot<00:03:55.690> is<00:03:55.959> going<00:03:56.890> to

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:57.100 
barrel inevitably the shot is going to

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.320 
barrel inevitably the shot is going to
be<00:03:57.250> of<00:03:57.489> the<00:03:57.670> same<00:03:57.700> bore<00:03:58.590> but<00:03:59.590> with<00:03:59.800> no

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
be of the same bore but with no

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.900 
be of the same bore but with no
expansion<00:04:01.330> into<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.140> grooving<00:04:03.040> space<00:04:03.459> of<00:04:03.730> the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
expansion into the grooving space of the

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.600 
expansion into the grooving space of the
rifle<00:04:04.330> II<00:04:04.420> and<00:04:04.660> so<00:04:05.500> it<00:04:05.680> doesn't<00:04:06.220> have<00:04:06.340> the<00:04:06.430> same

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:06.610 
rifle II and so it doesn't have the same

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.930 
rifle II and so it doesn't have the same
accuracy<00:04:07.209> or<00:04:07.440> distance<00:04:08.519> but<00:04:09.519> this<00:04:09.640> thing<00:04:09.820> or

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
accuracy or distance but this thing or

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.729 
accuracy or distance but this thing or
fire<00:04:10.120> quite<00:04:10.420> happily<00:04:10.720> on<00:04:10.810> a<00:04:10.900> mile<00:04:11.200> I<00:04:13.590> find<00:04:14.590> it

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
fire quite happily on a mile I find it

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.520 
fire quite happily on a mile I find it
very<00:04:14.769> amusing<00:04:15.280> to<00:04:15.730> think<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.180> a<00:04:16.419> couple<00:04:17.410> of

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
very amusing to think that a couple of

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.580 
very amusing to think that a couple of
years<00:04:17.680> ago<00:04:17.890> BAE<00:04:18.700> who<00:04:19.269> responsible<00:04:19.959> for<00:04:20.290> making

the British RVs AB edition were advised

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.460 
the British RVs AB edition were advised
not<00:04:23.560> to<00:04:23.830> use<00:04:24.220> lead<00:04:24.610> in<00:04:25.000> the<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> militia<00:04:26.080> table

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
not to use lead in the a militia table

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.440 
not to use lead in the a militia table
because<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:26.830> is<00:04:27.250> dangerous

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
because that is dangerous

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:30.960 
because that is dangerous
so<00:04:29.200> that<00:04:29.440> little<00:04:29.590> now<00:04:29.950> Dickel<00:04:30.520> bit<00:04:30.670> in<00:04:30.850> the
