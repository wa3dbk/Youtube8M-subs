all is you're going to need to break two

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.570 
all is you're going to need to break two
blocks<00:01:58.990> like<00:01:59.290> that<00:01:59.590> and<00:01:59.799> you're<00:02:00.189> going<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.369> put

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
blocks like that and you're going to put

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.030 
blocks like that and you're going to put
the<00:02:00.790> lower<00:02:01.119> okay<00:02:01.600> the<00:02:01.930> lower<00:02:02.200> stone<00:02:02.680> slabs

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:03.040 
the lower okay the lower stone slabs

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.640 
the lower okay the lower stone slabs
down<00:02:03.340> and<00:02:03.729> then<00:02:04.000> order<00:02:04.330> like<00:02:04.540> this<00:02:04.900> okay

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
down and then order like this okay

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.630 
down and then order like this okay
around<00:02:06.280> it<00:02:06.790> and<00:02:07.200> then<00:02:08.200> you're<00:02:08.590> going<00:02:08.860> to<00:02:09.039> dig

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
around it and then you're going to dig

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.460 
around it and then you're going to dig
down<00:02:09.970> so<00:02:10.179> this<00:02:10.330> is<00:02:10.509> where<00:02:10.689> you<00:02:10.780> could<00:02:10.899> minecart

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
down so this is where you could minecart

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.550 
down so this is where you could minecart
and<00:02:11.590> your<00:02:12.180> role<00:02:13.180> is<00:02:13.480> going<00:02:13.689> to<00:02:13.779> be<00:02:13.840> placed<00:02:14.139> but

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
and your role is going to be placed but

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.270 
and your role is going to be placed but
we<00:02:14.709> need<00:02:14.859> to<00:02:15.040> put<00:02:15.310> a

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
we need to put a

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.000 
we need to put a
upper<00:02:16.700> stone<00:02:17.060> slab<00:02:17.360> on<00:02:17.600> first<00:02:17.959> so<00:02:18.530> we<00:02:18.740> need<00:02:18.890> to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
upper stone slab on first so we need to

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:24.940 
upper stone slab on first so we need to
build<00:02:19.160> the<00:02:19.370> dirt<00:02:19.580> upwards<00:02:20.180> like<00:02:20.660> so<00:02:23.470> like<00:02:24.470> that

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
build the dirt upwards like so like that

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.920 
build the dirt upwards like so like that
and<00:02:25.220> then<00:02:25.730> we're<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.000> to<00:02:26.090> just<00:02:26.240> break<00:02:26.630> down

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
and then we're going to just break down

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.510 
and then we're going to just break down
these<00:02:27.170> dirt<00:02:27.500> blocks<00:02:27.830> and<00:02:28.130> we're<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.340> to<00:02:28.400> get

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
these dirt blocks and we're going to get

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.010 
these dirt blocks and we're going to get
upset<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:29.060> we're<00:02:29.209> going<00:02:29.330> to<00:02:29.390> place<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.660> on<00:02:29.750> the

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
upset and we're going to place it on the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.190 
upset and we're going to place it on the
ceiling<00:02:30.440> okay<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.100> top<00:02:31.370> part<00:02:31.700> of<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:32.900> dirt

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
ceiling okay the top part of that dirt

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.670 
ceiling okay the top part of that dirt
block<00:02:33.590> right<00:02:34.600> hopefully<00:02:35.600> that's<00:02:36.050> easy<00:02:36.440> enough

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
block right hopefully that's easy enough

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.380 
block right hopefully that's easy enough
and<00:02:37.280> there<00:02:37.459> you<00:02:37.550> go<00:02:37.670> you've<00:02:37.850> already<00:02:37.970> built<00:02:38.239> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
and there you go you've already built it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.640 
and there you go you've already built it
so<00:02:38.510> you<00:02:38.569> need<00:02:38.750> to<00:02:38.870> do<00:02:38.959> is<00:02:39.050> just<00:02:39.200> break<00:02:39.440> this

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so you need to do is just break this

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.280 
so you need to do is just break this
stick<00:02:40.220> in<00:02:40.430> your<00:02:40.700> mind<00:02:40.910> cut<00:02:41.270> with<00:02:41.450> your<00:02:41.480> rel<00:02:41.900> and
