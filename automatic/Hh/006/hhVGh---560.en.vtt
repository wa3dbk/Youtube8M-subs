first video we talked about a basic

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.560 
first video we talked about a basic
chord<00:00:27.869> structure<00:00:28.670> how<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.150> know<00:00:30.179> pick<00:00:30.449> out

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
chord structure how to you know pick out

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.810 
chord structure how to you know pick out
the<00:00:30.720> chord<00:00:30.990> tones<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.650> then<00:00:32.250> also<00:00:32.430> how<00:00:32.759> the

the chord tones and then also how the

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.090 
the chord tones and then also how the
corresponding<00:00:33.540> scale<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:34.649> if<00:00:34.770> you're<00:00:34.920> that

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
corresponding scale so if you're that

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.119 
corresponding scale so if you're that
far<00:00:35.520> along<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.420> next<00:00:36.660> thing<00:00:36.899> would<00:00:37.020> be<00:00:37.230> coming

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it typically what happens when you're

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.990 
it typically what happens when you're
doing<00:00:49.110> an<00:00:49.410> improv<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.610> was<00:00:50.820> no<00:00:50.969> different

doing an improv and I was no different
when<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> started<00:00:51.960> out<00:00:52.079> what<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.350> wanted<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.070> see

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
when I started out what I wanted to see

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.799 
when I started out what I wanted to see
how<00:00:53.340> many<00:00:53.550> notes<00:00:53.730> could<00:00:53.910> I<00:00:54.000> put<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.480> minute

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
how many notes could I put in a minute

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.290 
how many notes could I put in a minute
when<00:00:55.590> I<00:00:55.620> improvise<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.730> everything<00:00:56.969> sound

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
when I improvise and so everything sound

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.770 
when I improvise and so everything sound
like<00:00:58.309> you<00:00:59.309> know<00:00:59.399> nothing<00:00:59.760> ever<00:00:59.879> made<00:01:00.180> sense

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
let's see we can make some sense out of

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
doing 12 bar blues I would come up with

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
doing 12 bar blues I would come up with
a<00:01:25.500> motif<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.280> let's<00:01:26.580> see<00:01:26.850> you<00:01:27.000> through<00:01:27.360> the

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
a motif and let's see you through the

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.230 
a motif and let's see you through the
changes<00:01:28.409> if<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:28.979> can<00:01:29.369> keep<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.880> motif

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
changes if you can keep that motif

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.020 
changes if you can keep that motif
throughout<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.500> then<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.460> as<00:01:32.790> you

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
throughout and then what you do as you

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.550 
throughout and then what you do as you
play<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.299> motive<00:01:33.810> through<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.200> different

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
play the motive through the different

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.010 
play the motive through the different
key<00:01:34.770> through<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> different<00:01:36.060> chords<00:01:36.360> then

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
key through the different chords then

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.730 
key through the different chords then
what<00:01:37.259> you<00:01:37.409> do<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.829> gradually<00:01:38.700> morph<00:01:39.119> add

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
what you do you gradually morph add

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.700 
what you do you gradually morph add
invert<00:01:40.740> twist<00:01:41.250> and<00:01:41.579> change<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.470> then<00:01:43.470> what<00:01:43.590> it

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
invert twist and change and then what it

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.819 
invert twist and change and then what it
does<00:01:43.740> it's<00:01:44.100> slowly<00:01:44.520> developing<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.720> if<00:01:46.710> you

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
does it's slowly developing and if you

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.770 
does it's slowly developing and if you
do<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.070> right<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> really<00:01:48.119> makes<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.600> some

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
do it right it really makes you some

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.090 
do it right it really makes you some
interesting<00:01:50.000> lines<00:01:51.320> so<00:01:52.320> basically<00:01:52.770> let's

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
interesting lines so basically let's

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:12.420 
interesting lines so basically let's
just<00:01:53.280> say<00:01:53.460> I'm<00:01:53.520> sorry

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.400 

there<00:02:13.430> are<00:02:13.550> small<00:02:13.760> bar<00:02:14.150> blues<00:02:14.390> and<00:02:14.840> though<00:02:15.380> I

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
there are small bar blues and though I

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.490 
there are small bar blues and though I
did<00:02:15.770> I<00:02:15.950> took<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.430> basic<00:02:16.970> motive<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.660> then<00:02:18.410> I

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
did I took that basic motive and then I

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
did I took that basic motive and then I
just<00:02:18.709> gradually<00:02:19.160> morphed<00:02:20.000> an<00:02:20.330> ad<00:02:20.540> depending

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
just gradually morphed an ad depending

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.050 
just gradually morphed an ad depending
upon<00:02:21.590> the<00:02:21.890> court<00:02:22.160> I<00:02:22.310> was<00:02:22.459> on<00:02:22.670> at<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:22.880> moment
