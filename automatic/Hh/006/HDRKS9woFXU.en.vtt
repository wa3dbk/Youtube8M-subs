clock<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:43.410> made<00:00:44.870> basically<00:00:45.870> there's<00:00:46.289> two

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
clock we made basically there's two

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.479 
clock we made basically there's two
buttons<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.270> LCD<00:00:49.219> there's<00:00:50.219> three

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
buttons in the LCD there's three

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.420 
buttons in the LCD there's three
different<00:00:50.640> modes<00:00:51.000> right<00:00:51.690> now<00:00:51.809> it's<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
different modes right now it's in a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:54.920 
different modes right now it's in a
random<00:00:53.430> color<00:00:53.699> changing<00:00:54.180> mode<00:00:54.329> we<00:00:54.600> have<00:00:54.719> three

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
random color changing mode we have three

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.119 
random color changing mode we have three
different<00:00:55.140> modes<00:00:55.489> we<00:00:56.489> turn<00:00:56.730> it<00:00:56.850> off<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:58.129> we

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
different modes we turn it off and we

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.510 
different modes we turn it off and we
have<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.489> music<00:00:59.670> syncing<00:01:01.100> light<00:01:02.100> orb<00:01:02.309> mode

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
have the music syncing light orb mode

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.020 
have the music syncing light orb mode
which<00:01:03.480> we<00:01:04.290> put<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.619> a<00:01:04.650> little<00:01:05.129> jingle<00:01:05.700> bells

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
which we put on a little jingle bells

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:14.390 
which we put on a little jingle bells
and<00:01:06.950> then<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.369> have<00:01:09.979> the<00:01:10.979> blues<00:01:11.250> mode<00:01:13.220> as<00:01:14.220> you

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
and then we have the blues mode as you

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.350 
and then we have the blues mode as you
can<00:01:14.549> see<00:01:14.990> after<00:01:16.009> every<00:01:17.009> note<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:18.030> music

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
can see after every note of the music

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.510 
can see after every note of the music
will<00:01:18.570> change<00:01:19.220> and<00:01:20.220> then<00:01:20.549> we<00:01:20.729> have<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
will change and then we have the

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:30.850 
will change and then we have the
different<00:01:23.780> different<00:01:24.780> colors<00:01:25.170> white<00:01:26.630> blue

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:09.529 
PWM three PWM outputs of the CB 280
module<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:05.149> basically<00:02:06.200> it<00:02:07.200> will<00:02:07.320> control<00:02:08.539> the

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
module and basically it will control the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.930 
module and basically it will control the
intensity<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.259> LEDs<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.099> we<00:02:11.760> have<00:02:11.910> a

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
intensity of the LEDs and we have a

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.920 
intensity of the LEDs and we have a
little<00:02:12.290> PSO

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
little PSO

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.949 
little PSO
that's<00:02:14.409> hooked<00:02:14.590> up<00:02:14.799> to<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.129> PWM<00:02:15.760> to<00:02:15.959> which

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
that's hooked up to the PWM to which

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.550 
that's hooked up to the PWM to which
makes<00:02:17.200> the<00:02:17.349> sound<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.829> we<00:02:17.890> have<00:02:18.099> these<00:02:18.670> three

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
makes the sound and we have these three

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.270 
makes the sound and we have these three
underlining<00:02:21.450> blue<00:02:22.450> LEDs<00:02:23.049> that<00:02:23.379> will<00:02:23.920> give<00:02:24.250> us

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
underlining blue LEDs that will give us

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.929 
underlining blue LEDs that will give us
the<00:02:24.480> light<00:02:25.480> effect<00:02:25.870> underneath<00:02:26.730> we<00:02:27.730> have<00:02:27.909> a

00:02:27.929 --> 00:02:27.939 
the light effect underneath we have a

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.259 
the light effect underneath we have a
little<00:02:28.890> cool<00:02:29.890> like<00:02:30.189> light<00:02:30.549> effect<00:02:30.879> kind<00:02:31.090> of

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:31.269 
little cool like light effect kind of

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.199 
little cool like light effect kind of
like<00:02:31.530> cars<00:02:32.530> now<00:02:32.980> nowadays<00:02:33.819> and<00:02:34.389> then<00:02:35.170> uh<00:02:36.209> well

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
like cars now nowadays and then uh well

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.860 
like cars now nowadays and then uh well
so<00:02:37.389> we<00:02:37.480> have<00:02:37.659> we<00:02:37.959> also<00:02:38.290> have<00:02:38.709> a<00:02:42.450> we<00:02:43.450> have<00:02:43.629> these

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
so we have we also have a we have these

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:49.110 
so we have we also have a we have these
oh<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.530> have<00:02:44.709> the<00:02:44.889> LCD<00:02:45.900> right<00:02:46.900> here<00:02:47.849> if<00:02:48.849> we<00:02:49.000> get

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
oh we have the LCD right here if we get

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.149 
oh we have the LCD right here if we get
a<00:02:49.180> close-up<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:50.470> will<00:02:50.769> now<00:02:51.189> look<00:02:51.579> at<00:02:51.849> the<00:02:53.159> LCD

00:02:54.149 --> 00:02:54.159 
a close-up it will now look at the LCD

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:58.949 
a close-up it will now look at the LCD
menu<00:02:54.930> configuration<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:56.169> also<00:02:57.959> the

different modes and you can see we put a

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.800 
different modes and you can see we put a
little<00:03:01.510> the<00:03:02.319> high<00:03:02.469> intensity<00:03:03.069> lights<00:03:03.669> act<00:03:04.450> as

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
little the high intensity lights act as

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.429 
little the high intensity lights act as
a<00:03:04.859> night<00:03:05.859> light<00:03:05.889> we<00:03:06.730> can<00:03:06.879> also<00:03:07.139> control<00:03:08.139> this

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
a night light we can also control this

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.039 
a night light we can also control this
