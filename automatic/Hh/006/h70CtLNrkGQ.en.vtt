00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome to a recipe Tuesday and 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.010
 Well today I have something like that 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.960
 well refreshing for these days of 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.040
 summer that are half rare 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.809
 because it's really hot from 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.420
 it's raining but good so the 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.740
 I'm going to leave with the good recipe our 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.930
 ingredients are going to be the following the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.840
 they like some ingredient that I am 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.269
 showing you know that they can 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.970
 change and if you want to do the 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:30.300
 Fish ceviche is super good and 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.540
 well we're going to need 8 lemons let's go 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.260
 to need a celery twig too 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.260
 one onion 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.600
 we're also going to need cucumber here 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.370
 I put everything a whole tomato cucumber 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.309
 a tomato 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.170
 we're also going to need cilantro myself 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:51.610
 here I put myself very what I knew is that 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.250
 I love the cilantro sixers of 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.050
 I'm also quite upset 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.719
 oregano 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:01.750
 salt of garlic too and I will use oyster 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.180
 ketchup sauce and valentina sauce can not 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.720
 miss and shrimp here I am using a 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.130
 kilo for my husband and for me nothing more and 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.710
 well the next thing we're going to do is 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.390
 boil water with two pits 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:18.340
 install ok and we will pay you the moment 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.759
 that is already boiling we are going to add 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.259
 the shrimp with everything and shell but 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:24.490
 remember that your fire has to be 

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.259
 off because we do not want to be 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.539
 pick up and chews because 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.430
 they know very bad so we're just going to 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:35.039
 spend them that little bit on what they put 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.039
 roses take it out and they are going to drain the water 

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:41.359
 well they look like they 're cooked and what I'm going 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:45.040
 to do is start sven would make him take away 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:48.730
 the shell and that's how they look 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:52.270
 and then I'm going to cut them into pieces 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.560
 that's how I'm starting them because 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.800
 at least I do not like the whole 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.330
 shrimp on the in the ceviche and good ya 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.450
 that are well parted 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:04.010
 I'm going to put the lemon here the lemon 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.160
 I had to leave then because I did not 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.960
 it fit in the juicer this but here what 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.690
 I'm going to put everything all the lemon and it's going to 

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.230
 look like this later I'm going to cover it up for a 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.880
 ok full time let's let that 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.030
 rest the shrimp very well with the lemon 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.380
 and after the time that has already passed we are going to 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:25.880

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.470

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.240

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.410
 nador that is the oregano missal of garlic and 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.970

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.530
 my parents' secret they told me 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.060
