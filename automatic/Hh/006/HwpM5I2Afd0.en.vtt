00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.090
 too many brass remove them from the syrup and 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.110

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.110
 cake preparation 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.369
 I have here chocolate with 2 spoons 

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.009
 soup or vanilla extract that I 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:38.409
 will melt in a container game 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.939
 but the blues softened with sugar and 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:49.569
 I'm going to work on it for that 

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:53.340
 be cream now add the eggs 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.340
 one at a time, beating each time 

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:06.090
 add the chocolate and continue to beat 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.679
 to properly incorporate into the preparation 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.310
 before adding the dry ingredients 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:15.430
 so the almond powder the flour 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.349
 sifted with the baking powder and the 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.030
 cocoa 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:22.590
 we will of course continue to mix for 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.590
 have a homogeneous preparation 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.480
 pour the mixture into a mold 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.980
 buttered preferably a mold to 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.590
 hinge to facilitate demolding 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.490
 subsequently the mold that I used 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.740
 son is 23 cm and then you have them 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.420
 pears over them by pushing them in 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:49.959
 so that they touch the bottom 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:51.760
 of the world the oven and preheated to 180 Â° 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:55.709
 have returned our cake and let 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.709
 cook for 45 to 50 minutes 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.500
 we can serve this cake like that without 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.870
 add nothing more we leave him well 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:06.730
 cool but if you prepare for a 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.459
 special occasion as a birthday 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 for example you can always him 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:13.750
 give a more greedy effect in 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.660
 adding a chocolate ganache 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.459
 so I heated cream that 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:20.770
 I pour on the chocolates you mix 

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:23.620
 until you get a good ganache 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:28.120
 brilliant and wanted to pour everything on 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:30.130
 the cake a little tip before 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.870

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.120
 preferably this cake for the next day 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.410
 you look closely and you unmold 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.810
 along the months he will have a better 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.940
 texture will no longer make it easy to 

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:44.620
 unravel and chop and the town will be 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.120

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.140
