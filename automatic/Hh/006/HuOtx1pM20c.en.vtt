00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
looks awesome i had to have this figure

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.779 
looks awesome i had to have this figure
i'm<00:00:45.559> good<00:00:46.559> i<00:00:46.739> passed<00:00:47.010> on<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.309> other<00:00:47.460> two<00:00:47.610> that

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
couldn't so transpiration is exactly the

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.410 
couldn't so transpiration is exactly the
same<00:00:54.780> as<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:54.960> other<00:00:55.199> one<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:56.370> other<00:00:56.699> titanium

any<00:01:11.640> role<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:11.880> pretty<00:01:12.090> decently<00:01:12.420> but<00:01:12.630> you<00:01:12.869> kind

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
any role is pretty decently but you kind

on<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.900> ladder<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.770> will<00:01:25.950> go<00:01:26.130> up<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
on the ladder it will go up if it

front portion of this ladder set up this

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.230 
front portion of this ladder set up this
will<00:01:40.500> move<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.130> black<00:01:41.310> piece<00:01:41.549> but<00:01:41.880> it's

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
will move to the black piece but it's

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.969 
will move to the black piece but it's
only<00:01:42.479> my<00:01:42.570> 30<00:01:42.780> for<00:01:42.990> transformation<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:43.740> again

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
only my 30 for transformation but again

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.560 
only my 30 for transformation but again
it's<00:01:44.130> just<00:01:44.250> kind<00:01:44.460> of<00:01:44.490> Wiggles<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.030> wobbles<00:01:45.390> on

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's just kind of Wiggles and wobbles on

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.010 
it's just kind of Wiggles and wobbles on
the<00:01:46.350> back<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> but<00:01:48.240> this<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:48.540> definitely<00:01:48.780> not

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
the back so but this is definitely not

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
the back so but this is definitely not
the<00:01:49.079> mode<00:01:49.350> you'll<00:01:49.560> display<00:01:49.890> this<00:01:50.070> guy<00:01:50.250> in<00:01:50.430> he

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
the mode you'll display this guy in he

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
the mode you'll display this guy in he
just<00:01:50.820> he<00:01:51.420> looks<00:01:51.600> way<00:01:51.750> too<00:01:51.780> good<00:01:52.020> robot<00:01:52.409> mode<00:01:52.560> in

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
just he looks way too good robot mode in

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.160 
just he looks way too good robot mode in
my<00:01:52.770> opinion<00:01:53.119> so<00:01:54.119> you<00:01:54.180> start<00:01:54.420> by<00:01:54.570> untagging

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
my opinion so you start by untagging

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.280 
my opinion so you start by untagging
here<00:01:55.530> and<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.740> course<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.280> most<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.850> the

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
goodness here but untie bit here tabs in

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:09.770 
goodness here but untie bit here tabs in
pretty<00:02:02.490> well<00:02:03.979> rotate<00:02:04.979> this<00:02:05.340> down

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.510 

rotate<00:02:10.780> this<00:02:10.900> portion<00:02:11.320> down<00:02:11.470> and<00:02:11.740> this

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
rotate this portion down and this

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.890 
rotate this portion down and this
portion<00:02:12.760> down<00:02:13.650> separate<00:02:14.650> these<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.690> go

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
portion down separate these here and go

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.150 
portion down separate these here and go
ahead<00:02:19.960> and<00:02:20.050> separate<00:02:20.380> the<00:02:20.530> legs<00:02:20.650> just<00:02:20.950> go

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
ahead and separate the legs just go

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.340 
ahead and separate the legs just go
ahead<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.310> do<00:02:21.460> a<00:02:21.490> good<00:02:21.730> separation<00:02:22.420> top<00:02:23.230> of

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:23.350 
ahead and do a good separation top of

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:26.210 
ahead and do a good separation top of
the<00:02:23.410> cab<00:02:23.590> can<00:02:23.770> also<00:02:23.890> come<00:02:24.190> down<00:02:24.340> if<00:02:24.520> you'd<00:02:24.640> like

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
the cab can also come down if you'd like

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.470 
the cab can also come down if you'd like
so<00:02:27.220> the<00:02:27.310> front<00:02:27.460> portion<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.090> this<00:02:28.330> will

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
so the front portion here this will

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.020 
so the front portion here this will
rotate<00:02:28.600> around<00:02:29.130> pegs<00:02:30.130> in<00:02:30.340> and<00:02:30.610> then<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:30.910> will

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
rotate around pegs in and then this will

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:33.990 
rotate around pegs in and then this will
kind<00:02:31.210> of<00:02:31.300> lock<00:02:31.480> into<00:02:31.810> place<00:02:32.730> same<00:02:33.730> thing<00:02:33.910> with

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
kind of lock into place same thing with

kind of lock into place same thing with
the<00:02:34.060> other<00:02:34.150> side<00:02:34.590> kind<00:02:35.590> of<00:02:35.710> wraps<00:02:35.890> around

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
the other side kind of wraps around

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.280 
the other side kind of wraps around
locks<00:02:36.490> into<00:02:36.670> place<00:02:36.880> and<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.750> back<00:02:37.900> portion<00:02:38.140> of

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
locks into place and the back portion of

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.310 
locks into place and the back portion of
the<00:02:38.350> cab<00:02:38.640> these<00:02:39.640> things<00:02:39.910> fall<00:02:40.150> down<00:02:40.330> these<00:02:41.140> are

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
the cab these things fall down these are

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.560 
the cab these things fall down these are
diecast<00:02:41.770> feet<00:02:42.100> so<00:02:42.850> you<00:02:42.880> kind<00:02:43.180> of<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:43.360> line

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
diecast feet so you kind of just line
