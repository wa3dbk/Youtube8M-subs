00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
really strong in this particular field

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.409 
really strong in this particular field
of<00:00:22.169> study<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.859> everyone<00:00:23.730> had<00:00:23.909> good<00:00:24.119> things<00:00:24.269> to

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I believe that having an international

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.890 
I believe that having an international
accreditation<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:07.470> very<00:01:08.280> useful<00:01:08.729> um<00:01:08.939> but<00:01:09.750> then

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
accreditation is very useful um but then

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.240 
accreditation is very useful um but then
also<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.200> work<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.060> with<00:01:12.060> poverty<00:01:12.479> reduction
