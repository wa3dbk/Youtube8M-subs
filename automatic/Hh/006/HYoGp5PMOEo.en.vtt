00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.940
 and looking at a diagonal mark centimeter 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.969
 a bridge meeting with the other 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.369
 I'm going to cut this little square and cut it 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 here and shooting will serve as a guide 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.110
 You can do the singing master have

 quadradinho will now cut not here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.020
 I know if it will have to view cut 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:18.330
 here to make the corner and we go

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.970
 this little square here on the book page 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.520
 in the corner and now we will make a 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.770
 Where is it going? 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.509
 to sew with the straight seam and in 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.890
 Scheme here we'll do it 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.930
 sew on it 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.810
 however a straight point we go 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.049
 leave the needle in the center of this water 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:44.119
 Sewing is going to be a machine 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.119
 kill people we'll search 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.000
 Sew on the line 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.860
 we stitch here we pull the machine 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.220
 let's use posture as a reference 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.560
 bend with the posture will give this 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.320
 little girl then let's fold her and another 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.780
 above will be quiet here we go 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.540
 close up mouse here and let's go 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:19.060
 sew you can see that here looks 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.770
 I'll loose the same thing in this 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.880
 I'm going to fit a little square 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.370
 chain 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:30.220
 morries cars and this goes from the province 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:35.070
 wake up, look, we're lookin ' 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.070
 Petty turned posture does not serve 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.560
 Let's do the same thing here, football. 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.570
 We need to go there and we'll bring the fabric 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.030
 used this tab 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.260
 We're going to make the globe here. 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.260
 We'll be here until the end. 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.780
 this has been here will be the same as 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.360
 I wore a cape 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.770
 Now I'll pass a sponge look at the 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.410
 corner that is practically 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.780
 Stitch- like shape as I told you when 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.820
 to pass as a filter or put a 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.250
 third child here to protect your dad 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.920
 I'll be right back with him, I passed with the 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:16.230
 my college floor with have been folded I 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.910
 I have not faced with finishing myself 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.900
 I'll put the folding of the fabric that looks 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.000
 people 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.370
 the stitching evolving with stitches 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 izaguirre closing this part I go 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.980
 use that line of data it enters 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:31.320
 in this three shades blue pink and yellow 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.650
 I'll use it on top and on the reel. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.000
 below but you want you can use the 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.580
 one color line only 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.980
 The secret here in this finish is to use 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:42.930
 this marking that the seam as 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:44.970
 reference so that it will use this 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.800
 guide that line as I already put the 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.360
 gold cloth does not have to be 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.370
 worried about the camping here is just 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.370
 fold and close a zig zag here 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.130
 can quickly use a dot 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.130
 decorative 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:04.190
 how does he have that marquinha that only has 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:04.190
 to fold 

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.820
 Let's do the same thing as I am in 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.820
 tripe 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.490
 we raise the foot we eliminate the 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.490
 we finished down here 

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:37.740
 Let's fold the corner again and 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:40.259
 let's finish here O look is here 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.240

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:46.430
