few differences in wake surfboards you
know<00:00:25.330> there's<00:00:25.480> lots<00:00:25.570> of<00:00:25.660> different<00:00:25.930> companies

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:26.230 
know there's lots of different companies

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.269 
know there's lots of different companies
that<00:00:26.259> make<00:00:26.500> them<00:00:26.619> out<00:00:26.740> there<00:00:26.890> and<00:00:27.040> lots<00:00:27.160> of

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
that make them out there and lots of

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.589 
that make them out there and lots of
different<00:00:27.580> designs<00:00:27.880> but<00:00:28.210> there's<00:00:28.360> actually

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:28.599 
different designs but there's actually

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.540 
different designs but there's actually
two<00:00:28.869> kind<00:00:29.439> of<00:00:29.529> different<00:00:29.740> categories<00:00:30.099> you're

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:30.550 
two kind of different categories you're

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.310 
two kind of different categories you're
gonna<00:00:30.640> have<00:00:30.910> a<00:00:30.939> skin<00:00:31.360> style<00:00:31.660> board<00:00:31.930> which<00:00:32.169> is

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:32.320 
gonna have a skin style board which is

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.080 
gonna have a skin style board which is
more<00:00:32.470> like<00:00:32.650> a<00:00:32.680> skin<00:00:32.950> board<00:00:33.160> or<00:00:33.850> you're<00:00:33.970> gonna

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
more like a skin board or you're gonna

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.450 
more like a skin board or you're gonna
be<00:00:34.270> on<00:00:34.390> a<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:34.750> a<00:00:34.810> Search<00:00:35.170> tab<00:00:35.380> or<00:00:35.620> that<00:00:35.770> is<00:00:36.190> more

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
be on a on a Search tab or that is more

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.200 
be on a on a Search tab or that is more
like<00:00:36.640> a<00:00:36.670> surfboard

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
like a surfboard

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:38.220 
like a surfboard
the<00:00:37.329> biggest<00:00:37.540> difference<00:00:37.930> you're<00:00:38.050> going<00:00:38.079> to

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
the biggest difference you're going to

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:40.890 
the biggest difference you're going to
see<00:00:38.410> is<00:00:38.739> the<00:00:39.010> fin<00:00:39.250> setup<00:00:39.520> so<00:00:40.300> on<00:00:40.420> a<00:00:40.450> surf<00:00:40.690> style

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 
see is the fin setup so on a surf style

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.209 
see is the fin setup so on a surf style
board<00:00:41.170> you're<00:00:41.290> gonna<00:00:41.380> have<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.590> fin<00:00:41.829> like<00:00:41.949> this

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:42.219 
board you're gonna have a fin like this

00:00:42.219 --> 00:00:44.160 
board you're gonna have a fin like this
let's<00:00:42.460> you<00:00:42.579> know<00:00:42.609> three<00:00:43.090> to<00:00:43.750> three<00:00:43.930> and<00:00:43.960> a<00:00:44.050> half

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
let's you know three to three and a half

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.680 
let's you know three to three and a half
inches<00:00:44.440> long<00:00:44.910> most<00:00:45.910> of<00:00:46.059> them<00:00:46.210> are<00:00:46.300> be<00:00:46.420> set<00:00:46.600> up

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
inches long most of them are be set up

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.029 
inches long most of them are be set up
like<00:00:46.840> a<00:00:46.870> thruster<00:00:47.379> setup<00:00:47.680> which<00:00:47.800> is<00:00:47.890> like<00:00:48.010> a

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
like a thruster setup which is like a

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:49.889 
like a thruster setup which is like a
three<00:00:48.340> fin<00:00:48.550> setup<00:00:48.789> like<00:00:49.030> this<00:00:49.300> and<00:00:49.780> these

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
three fin setup like this and these

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.720 
three fin setup like this and these
words<00:00:50.109> are<00:00:50.230> really<00:00:50.350> fun<00:00:50.680> to<00:00:50.800> do<00:00:50.949> Aires<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.609> do

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
words are really fun to do Aires and do

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:52.920 
words are really fun to do Aires and do
stuff<00:00:51.940> like<00:00:52.000> that<00:00:52.090> in<00:00:52.359> the<00:00:52.449> more<00:00:52.629> advanced

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
stuff like that in the more advanced

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.689 
stuff like that in the more advanced
wake<00:00:53.350> surfing<00:00:53.559> but<00:00:54.370> when<00:00:54.460> you're<00:00:54.579> first

00:00:54.689 --> 00:00:54.699 
wake surfing but when you're first

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:56.430 
wake surfing but when you're first
learning<00:00:54.940> to<00:00:55.149> having<00:00:55.629> these<00:00:55.719> big<00:00:55.929> fins<00:00:56.199> on<00:00:56.350> the

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
learning to having these big fins on the

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:57.750 
learning to having these big fins on the
board<00:00:56.649> they<00:00:57.070> keep<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.370> board<00:00:57.579> running

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
board they keep the board running

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.189 
board they keep the board running
straight<00:00:58.210> so<00:00:58.420> you're<00:00:58.510> not<00:00:58.660> really<00:00:58.899> worried

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
straight so you're not really worried

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:00.869 
straight so you're not really worried
about<00:00:59.289> slipping<00:00:59.949> out<00:01:00.070> or<00:01:00.489> you<00:01:00.609> know<00:01:00.699> just

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:00.879 
about slipping out or you know just

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.069 
about slipping out or you know just
having<00:01:01.000> that<00:01:01.179> really<00:01:01.329> loose<00:01:01.600> feeling<00:01:01.899> you

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:02.079 
having that really loose feeling you

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:03.119 
having that really loose feeling you
know<00:01:02.170> all<00:01:02.320> you<00:01:02.379> have<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.559> do<00:01:02.679> is<00:01:02.769> kind<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:02.980> keep

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:03.129 
know all you have to do is kind of keep

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:04.590 
know all you have to do is kind of keep
that<00:01:03.280> pressure<00:01:03.550> on<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.850> toe<00:01:04.000> side<00:01:04.239> rail<00:01:04.420> and

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
that pressure on that toe side rail and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.420 
that pressure on that toe side rail and
the<00:01:05.080> board's<00:01:05.320> gonna<00:01:05.410> work<00:01:05.710> down<00:01:05.890> the<00:01:06.010> line<00:01:06.190> for

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
the board's gonna work down the line for

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.220 
the board's gonna work down the line for
you<00:01:06.520> really<00:01:06.670> easy<00:01:06.940> but<00:01:07.600> another<00:01:07.810> way<00:01:07.960> to<00:01:08.020> ride

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:08.230 
you really easy but another way to ride

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:09.930 
you really easy but another way to ride
it<00:01:08.380> is<00:01:08.500> without<00:01:08.830> these<00:01:09.160> fins<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.670> just<00:01:09.850> to

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
it is without these fins and just to

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.670 
it is without these fins and just to
write<00:01:10.060> a<00:01:10.090> small<00:01:10.330> fin<00:01:10.720> like<00:01:10.870> this<00:01:11.110> just<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:11.650> the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:11.680 
write a small fin like this just in the

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.590 
write a small fin like this just in the
back<00:01:11.920> that's<00:01:12.160> one<00:01:12.310> center<00:01:12.640> fin<00:01:12.850> and<00:01:13.360> that's

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
back that's one center fin and that's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.630 
back that's one center fin and that's
considered<00:01:13.960> skin<00:01:14.290> style<00:01:14.590> so<00:01:15.250> when<00:01:15.549> you

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
considered skin style so when you

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.859 
considered skin style so when you
brought<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> setup<00:01:16.180> like<00:01:16.329> this<00:01:16.450> it's<00:01:16.780> a<00:01:16.810> lot

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
brought a setup like this it's a lot

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.450 
brought a setup like this it's a lot
easier<00:01:17.049> to<00:01:17.350> do<00:01:17.470> a<00:01:17.500> lot<00:01:17.710> of<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.920> spin<00:01:18.189> tricks

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:18.460 
easier to do a lot of the spin tricks

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.670 
easier to do a lot of the spin tricks
like<00:01:18.549> doing<00:01:18.850> shoved<00:01:19.150> and<00:01:19.509> you<00:01:19.810> know<00:01:19.900> 360<00:01:20.170> just

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
like doing shoved and you know 360 just

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.170 
like doing shoved and you know 360 just
because<00:01:20.829> the<00:01:20.950> board<00:01:21.159> releases<00:01:21.700> a<00:01:21.729> lot<00:01:21.939> quicker

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
because the board releases a lot quicker

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.870 
because the board releases a lot quicker
and<00:01:22.860> you're<00:01:23.860> relying<00:01:24.100> more<00:01:24.369> on<00:01:24.430> the<00:01:24.579> edge<00:01:24.729> of

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
and you're relying more on the edge of

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.999 
and you're relying more on the edge of
the<00:01:25.000> board<00:01:25.210> then<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:26.020> fin<00:01:26.259> so<00:01:26.590> it's<00:01:26.799> just<00:01:26.920> a

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
the board then on the fin so it's just a

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:28.649 
the board then on the fin so it's just a
totally<00:01:27.310> different<00:01:27.369> feeling<00:01:27.820> this<00:01:28.390> board

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:28.659 
totally different feeling this board

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.789 
totally different feeling this board
here<00:01:28.750> which<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.990> my<00:01:29.110> pro<00:01:29.320> model<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.649> hyper

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
here which is my pro model the hyper

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:31.740 
here which is my pro model the hyper
light<00:01:30.009> shim<00:01:30.280> it's<00:01:30.759> kind<00:01:30.939> of<00:01:31.030> a<00:01:31.090> hybrid<00:01:31.240> of<00:01:31.479> both

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
light shim it's kind of a hybrid of both

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.539 
light shim it's kind of a hybrid of both
of<00:01:31.930> those<00:01:32.049> different<00:01:32.619> designs<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.220> know

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:33.549 
of those different designs you know
