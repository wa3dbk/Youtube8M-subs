emergency happens and and now it's on
disc<00:02:19.200> 2<00:02:19.650> that's<00:02:20.489> almost<00:02:20.819> done<00:02:25.340> this<00:02:26.340> process

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
disc 2 that's almost done this process

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.340 
disc 2 that's almost done this process
is<00:02:26.970> pretty<00:02:27.150> quick<00:02:27.600> and<00:02:27.780> after<00:02:28.080> that<00:02:28.200> you're

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
is pretty quick and after that you're

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.440 
is pretty quick and after that you're
going<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.590> follow<00:02:28.770> some<00:02:29.220> steps<00:02:29.700> again<00:02:30.120> like<00:02:30.330> I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
going to follow some steps again like I

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.259 
going to follow some steps again like I
said<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:31.670> that<00:02:32.670> those<00:02:32.970> steps<00:02:33.360> will<00:02:33.600> be<00:02:35.269> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
said and that those steps will be you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.360 
said and that those steps will be you
know<00:02:36.390> chain<00:02:36.720> to<00:02:37.350> make<00:02:37.500> sure<00:02:37.739> you're<00:02:37.890> saying<00:02:38.160> at

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
know chain to make sure you're saying at

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.790 
know chain to make sure you're saying at
the<00:02:38.550> time<00:02:39.050> Clemens<00:02:40.050> own<00:02:40.230> or<00:02:40.440> whatever<00:02:40.680> you

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
the time Clemens own or whatever you

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.830 
the time Clemens own or whatever you
called<00:02:41.070> it<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:42.170> then<00:02:43.170> internet<00:02:43.830> connectivity

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
called it and then internet connectivity

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.250 
called it and then internet connectivity
and<00:02:46.730> yeah<00:02:47.730> so<00:02:47.940> that's<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.360> so<00:02:48.600> let's<00:02:48.810> wait<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
and yeah so that's it so let's wait a

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.350 
and yeah so that's it so let's wait a
little<00:02:49.410> bit<00:02:49.800> it's<00:02:49.980> almost<00:02:50.430> done<00:02:50.700> it<00:02:50.880> is<00:02:51.060> one

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
little bit it's almost done it is one

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:54.680 
little bit it's almost done it is one
minute<00:02:51.860> sometimes<00:02:52.860> I<00:02:52.950> could<00:02:53.130> be<00:02:53.220> wrong<00:02:53.400> I<00:02:53.730> have

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
minute sometimes I could be wrong I have

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.600 
minute sometimes I could be wrong I have
waited<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.170> long<00:02:55.350> time<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.830> past<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.400> you

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
waited a long time in the past with you

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:58.570 
waited a long time in the past with you
know<00:02:56.850> different<00:02:57.000> computers<00:02:57.630> i<00:02:57.720> have<00:02:57.900> fixed

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
know different computers i have fixed

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.009 
know different computers i have fixed
now<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.760> shows<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.209> this<00:03:00.420> three<00:03:00.870> is

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:01.019 
now it shows that this three is

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:08.660 
now it shows that this three is
installing<00:03:04.730> so<00:03:06.110> so<00:03:07.110> comparing<00:03:08.070> this<00:03:08.250> one<00:03:08.489> to

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
installing so so comparing this one to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.880 
installing so so comparing this one to
the<00:03:08.820> new<00:03:09.239> computer<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.900> i<00:03:09.930> purchased<00:03:10.290> here

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
the new computer that i purchased here

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:14.800 
the new computer that i purchased here
this<00:03:11.760> computer<00:03:12.180> works<00:03:12.510> really<00:03:13.440> really<00:03:13.650> nicely

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
this computer works really really nicely

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.780 
this computer works really really nicely
which<00:03:15.810> i<00:03:15.989> recommend<00:03:16.170> everybody<00:03:16.650> find<00:03:17.400> one<00:03:17.670> if

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
which i recommend everybody find one if

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.729 
which i recommend everybody find one if
they<00:03:17.970> can<00:03:18.299> if<00:03:18.600> this<00:03:18.959> night<00:03:19.290> you<00:03:19.440> know<00:03:19.530> there's

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
they can if this night you know there's

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.940 
they can if this night you know there's
always<00:03:20.010> different<00:03:20.160> options<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.769> this<00:03:22.769> one

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950 
always different options but this one

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.080 
always different options but this one
like<00:03:23.070> is<00:03:23.190> this<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> 24-inch<00:03:24.269> this<00:03:24.720> is<00:03:24.870> a

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
like is this a 24-inch this is a

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.319 
like is this a 24-inch this is a
all-in-one<00:03:27.090> touchscreen<00:03:29.150> computer<00:03:30.150> and<00:03:30.269> i

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
all-in-one touchscreen computer and i

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.000 
all-in-one touchscreen computer and i
bought<00:03:30.510> a<00:03:30.570> couple<00:03:30.930> of<00:03:31.109> months<00:03:31.380> ago<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.739> now<00:03:31.980> i

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
bought a couple of months ago and now i

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.130 
bought a couple of months ago and now i
notice<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.640> they<00:03:32.880> have<00:03:35.299> they<00:03:36.299> have<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.540> 3d

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
notice that they have they have a 3d

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:38.860 
notice that they have they have a 3d
version<00:03:37.410> which<00:03:37.890> i<00:03:38.040> think<00:03:38.100> is<00:03:38.400> kind<00:03:38.609> of

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
version which i think is kind of

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.170 
version which i think is kind of
pointless<00:03:39.870> on<00:03:40.320> having<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.650> 3d<00:03:41.100> computer<00:03:41.790> at<00:03:42.060> any

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180 
pointless on having a 3d computer at any

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.360 
pointless on having a 3d computer at any
point<00:03:42.329> is<00:03:42.480> that<00:03:42.630> you<00:03:42.720> know<00:03:42.900> you<00:03:42.959> have<00:03:43.320> a<00:03:43.820> new
