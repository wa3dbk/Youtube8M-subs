it

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.290 
it
only<00:00:52.649> thing<00:00:52.920> is<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.460> writing<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
only thing is the writing on the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.720 
only thing is the writing on the
packaging<00:00:54.809> goes<00:00:55.440> off<00:00:55.620> really<00:00:56.190> really<00:00:56.489> fast

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
because this is what it's supposed to

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.240 
because this is what it's supposed to
look<00:00:57.989> like<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.559> what<00:00:58.829> it<00:00:58.949> looks<00:00:59.129> like

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250

retouch light reflecting concealer by
cheese<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.619> like<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.130> much<00:01:41.729> more

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
cheese and I like that one much more

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
cheese and I like that one much more
than<00:01:42.329> I<00:01:42.450> do<00:01:42.509> this<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.170> for<00:01:43.799> right<00:01:43.979> now<00:01:44.009> at

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
than I do this one for right now at

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.690 
than I do this one for right now at
least<00:01:44.670> because<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.200> texture<00:01:46.680> is<00:01:46.829> nicer<00:01:47.369> on<00:01:47.399> my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700

least because the texture is nicer on my
skin<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:49.170> feel<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.619> it<00:01:49.770> covers<00:01:50.220> more<00:01:50.520> than

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
skin and I feel like it covers more than

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.539 
skin and I feel like it covers more than
this<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.350> have<00:01:52.530> to<00:01:52.649> put<00:01:52.860> on<00:01:52.920> quite<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.250> lot

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
this this I have to put on quite a lot

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.240 
this this I have to put on quite a lot
for<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:53.970> to<00:01:54.240> actually<00:01:54.390> cover<00:01:54.780> blemishes<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
for it to actually cover blemishes and

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.209 
for it to actually cover blemishes and
spots<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.149> it<00:01:57.780> feels<00:01:58.079> a<00:01:58.200> bit<00:01:58.229> greasy<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:59.009> my

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.600 
spots and it feels a bit greasy on my
skin<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.909> it<00:02:00.630> doesn't<00:02:00.810> feel<00:02:01.110> as<00:02:01.170> nice<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.250> my

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
skin and it doesn't feel as nice as my

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.660 
skin and it doesn't feel as nice as my
other<00:02:02.729> concealer<00:02:03.270> does<00:02:03.509> so<00:02:04.369> we'll<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.579> about
