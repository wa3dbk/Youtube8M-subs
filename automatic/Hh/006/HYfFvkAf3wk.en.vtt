a laptop you go to the store and play
with<00:01:07.799> them<00:01:07.979> because<00:01:08.430> you<00:01:08.790> can<00:01:08.970> look<00:01:09.180> on<00:01:09.390> the

with them because you can look on the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.960 
with them because you can look on the
internet<00:01:10.229> all<00:01:10.439> day<00:01:10.470> long<00:01:11.040> but<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.820> you

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
internet all day long but if you

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.700 
internet all day long but if you
actually<00:01:12.150> don't<00:01:12.630> sit<00:01:12.900> down<00:01:13.049> and<00:01:13.260> get<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.470> feel

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
actually don't sit down and get the feel

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.230 
actually don't sit down and get the feel
of<00:01:13.740> one<00:01:14.189> you're<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.790> make<00:01:14.909> a<00:01:14.970> bad

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
of one you're going to make a bad

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.620 
of one you're going to make a bad
decision<00:01:16.520> screen<00:01:17.520> size<00:01:17.700> is<00:01:17.939> a<00:01:17.970> big<00:01:18.060> deal<00:01:18.420> right

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
decision screen size is a big deal right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.539 
decision screen size is a big deal right
here<00:01:18.689> because<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.409> screen<00:01:19.770> size<00:01:20.009> is<00:01:20.040> going

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
here because this screen size is going

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.030 
here because this screen size is going
to<00:01:20.640> determine<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:21.600> entire<00:01:22.200> size<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.950> the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
to determine the entire size of the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700 
to determine the entire size of the
laptop<00:01:23.490> itself<00:01:24.350> another<00:01:25.350> thing<00:01:25.530> to<00:01:25.619> consider

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
laptop itself another thing to consider

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.149 
laptop itself another thing to consider
is<00:01:26.070> is<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.330> a<00:01:27.420> media<00:01:27.780> laptop<00:01:28.350> can<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:28.979> play
