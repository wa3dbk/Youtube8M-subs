and<00:02:32.690> put<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.440> it

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 

you<00:02:37.080> can<00:02:37.230> argue<00:02:37.350> either<00:02:37.620> the<00:02:37.800> Bible's<00:02:38.160> true

and is actually starting to happen or

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:43.070 
and is actually starting to happen or
you<00:02:41.730> could<00:02:41.880> argue<00:02:42.030> it's<00:02:42.180> really<00:02:42.540> good<00:02:42.690> science

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
you could argue it's really good science

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.070 
you could argue it's really good science
fiction<00:02:43.580> and<00:02:44.580> so<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:44.820> read<00:02:45.210> the<00:02:45.330> Bible<00:02:45.510> more<00:02:45.930> as
