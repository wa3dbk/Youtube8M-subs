00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
very buttery slide um so these ones are

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.460 
very buttery slide um so these ones are
pretty<00:01:39.030> new<00:01:39.479> just<00:01:40.409> breaking<00:01:40.650> them<00:01:40.860> in<00:01:42.470> their

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
Center set so once i start to cone them

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.830 
Center set so once i start to cone them
i<00:01:45.869> can<00:01:46.049> flip<00:01:46.229> them<00:01:46.439> around<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:47.600> there's<00:01:48.600> also

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
i can flip them around and there's also

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.569 
i can flip them around and there's also

red barrel bottom I was pushing set up
double<00:02:01.740> barrel<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.899> it's<00:02:04.680> nice<00:02:05.040> it<00:02:05.880> gives

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
double barrel so it's it's nice it gives

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.819 
double barrel so it's it's nice it gives
me<00:02:06.420> a<00:02:06.450> good<00:02:06.570> amount<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.869> stability<00:02:07.020> with<00:02:07.590> a

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
I'm great shop here in the bay area so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.190 
I'm great shop here in the bay area so
this<00:03:11.330> board<00:03:11.660> has<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:13.640> same<00:03:14.240> concave<00:03:14.840> as<00:03:15.020> the

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:15.200 
this board has the same concave as the

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.520 
this board has the same concave as the
supermodel<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.010> believe<00:03:16.360> so<00:03:17.360> it's<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.350> really

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
supermodel I believe so it's a really

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.280 
supermodel I believe so it's a really
nice<00:03:18.830> concave<00:03:19.370> but<00:03:19.700> in<00:03:19.880> my<00:03:20.060> opinion<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.630> could

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
nice concave but in my opinion it could

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.280 
nice concave but in my opinion it could
be<00:03:21.560> a<00:03:21.590> little<00:03:21.890> steeper<00:03:22.780> just<00:03:23.780> a<00:03:23.870> little<00:03:23.960> bit<00:03:24.200> if

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.290 
be a little steeper just a little bit if

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.660 
be a little steeper just a little bit if
you<00:03:24.380> can<00:03:24.530> see<00:03:24.710> that<00:03:24.740> it<00:03:25.130> could<00:03:25.310> be<00:03:25.340> a<00:03:25.460> little

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
you can see that it could be a little

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.490 
you can see that it could be a little
steeper<00:03:26.030> but<00:03:26.210> it's<00:03:26.420> really<00:03:26.720> nice<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.110> holds<00:03:27.380> me

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:27.500 
steeper but it's really nice it holds me

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:30.820 
steeper but it's really nice it holds me
in<00:03:27.530> pretty<00:03:27.830> well<00:03:28.660> it's<00:03:29.660> durable<00:03:30.140> it's<00:03:30.680> very

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
in pretty well it's durable it's very

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.460 
in pretty well it's durable it's very
durable<00:03:31.100> I<00:03:31.400> curbed<00:03:31.730> it<00:03:31.850> at<00:03:32.210> about<00:03:32.330> 25<00:03:32.900> did<00:03:33.320> not

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
durable I curbed it at about 25 did not

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:40.570 
durable I curbed it at about 25 did not
explode<00:03:33.830> on<00:03:34.040> me<00:03:37.360> so<00:03:38.980> it<00:03:39.980> has<00:03:40.010> an<00:03:40.459> adjustable

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
explode on me so it has an adjustable

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.920 
explode on me so it has an adjustable
wheel<00:03:41.180> base<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:42.260> goes<00:03:42.530> from<00:03:43.030> thirty<00:03:44.030> to<00:03:44.180> twenty

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
wheel base it goes from thirty to twenty

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.690 
wheel base it goes from thirty to twenty
nine<00:03:45.530> and<00:03:45.650> a<00:03:45.680> half<00:03:45.760> to<00:03:46.760> 29<00:03:47.209> and<00:03:48.490> it's<00:03:49.490> old

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
nine and a half to 29 and it's old

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.030 
nine and a half to 29 and it's old
school<00:03:49.970> in<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.450> middle<00:03:50.690> 29<00:03:51.500> and<00:03:51.650> a<00:03:51.680> half<00:03:51.709> inch

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
school in the middle 29 and a half inch

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.460 
school in the middle 29 and a half inch
wheelbase<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:53.630> if<00:03:53.720> you<00:03:53.810> want<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.020> run<00:03:54.140> Indies

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:54.470 
wheelbase so if you want to run Indies

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.699 
wheelbase so if you want to run Indies
on<00:03:54.620> it<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:54.860> can<00:03:55.240> it<00:03:56.240> has<00:03:56.420> great<00:03:56.750> wheel<00:03:57.320> cutouts

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
on it you can it has great wheel cutouts

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:00.520 
on it you can it has great wheel cutouts
and<00:03:57.920> wheel<00:03:58.190> wells<00:03:59.320> it's<00:04:00.320> like<00:04:00.500> a

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
and wheel wells it's like a

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:02.920 
and wheel wells it's like a
football-shaped<00:04:01.100> wheel<00:04:01.580> well<00:04:01.850> doesn't<00:04:02.810> give

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
football-shaped wheel well doesn't give

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.870 
football-shaped wheel well doesn't give
a<00:04:02.959> whole<00:04:03.230> lot<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.620> bite<00:04:03.800> but<00:04:04.070> sometimes<00:04:04.610> I<00:04:04.820> do

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:04.880 
a whole lot of bite but sometimes I do

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.490 
a whole lot of bite but sometimes I do
get<00:04:05.360> a<00:04:05.420> little<00:04:05.540> bit<00:04:05.750> of<00:04:05.780> bite<00:04:05.959> because<00:04:06.200> I've

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
get a little bit of bite because I've

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.480
