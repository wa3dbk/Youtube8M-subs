00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
deeper than most people think in college

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.560 
deeper than most people think in college
I<00:01:14.010> didn't<00:01:14.189> really<00:01:14.369> support<00:01:14.520> as<00:01:15.240> much<00:01:15.390> just

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
I didn't really support as much just

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120 
I didn't really support as much just
because<00:01:15.659> of<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:15.990> system<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.439> was<00:01:16.560> in<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:16.950> I

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
because of the system I was in but I

year I can give some minutes I don't

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.029 
year I can give some minutes I don't
know<00:02:07.360> possibly<00:02:08.019> start<00:02:08.380> but<00:02:08.619> it's<00:02:08.860> something

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
know possibly start but it's something

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:10.800 
know possibly start but it's something
depending<00:02:09.399> on<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.700> team<00:02:09.910> where<00:02:10.179> I<00:02:10.209> fall<00:02:10.299> into
