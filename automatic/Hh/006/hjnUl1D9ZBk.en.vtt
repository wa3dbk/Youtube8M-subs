I'm going to cut them in half again and

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.429

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
then you have quarters okay and I'm

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:08.830

flying<00:01:06.979> it<00:01:07.250> over<00:01:07.430> here<00:01:07.580> on<00:01:07.700> a<00:01:07.759> baking<00:01:08.000> sheet

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
flying it over here on a baking sheet

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.620 
flying it over here on a baking sheet
that<00:01:09.140> I've<00:01:10.100> lined<00:01:10.130> with<00:01:10.609> parchment<00:01:10.850> paper

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
that I've lined with parchment paper

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.599 
that I've lined with parchment paper
I<00:01:11.659> mean<00:01:11.990> parchment<00:01:12.530> paper<00:01:12.710> isn't<00:01:12.979> necessary

00:01:13.599 --> 00:01:13.609 
I mean parchment paper isn't necessary

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:17.050 
I mean parchment paper isn't necessary
but<00:01:13.850> I<00:01:14.840> like<00:01:15.439> it<00:01:15.619> because<00:01:15.950> it's<00:01:16.520> not<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.850> big

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
but I like it because it's not a big

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.440 
but I like it because it's not a big
mess<00:01:17.329> to<00:01:17.359> clean<00:01:17.780> up<00:01:17.929> after<00:01:18.259> the<00:01:18.289> potatoes<00:01:18.799> bake

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
mess to clean up after the potatoes bake

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.940 
mess to clean up after the potatoes bake
all<00:01:20.450> right<00:01:20.719> and<00:01:21.140> while<00:01:21.350> you're<00:01:21.530> doing<00:01:21.679> this

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
all right and while you're doing this

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.929 
all right and while you're doing this
it's<00:01:22.189> a<00:01:22.280> good<00:01:22.490> time<00:01:22.759> to<00:01:23.030> have<00:01:23.179> your<00:01:23.390> oven<00:01:23.749> on

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:24.939 
it's a good time to have your oven on

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:28.749 
it's a good time to have your oven on
450<00:01:25.939> Fahrenheit<00:01:27.280> because<00:01:28.280> these<00:01:28.429> are<00:01:28.579> going

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
450 Fahrenheit because these are going

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.649 
450 Fahrenheit because these are going
to<00:01:28.880> go<00:01:29.119> in<00:01:29.329> a<00:01:29.420> preheated<00:01:29.689> oven<00:01:30.200> and<00:01:30.770> bake<00:01:31.219> for

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
to go in a preheated oven and bake for

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.080 
to go in a preheated oven and bake for
45<00:01:32.659> minutes

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
45 minutes

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.240 
45 minutes
and<00:01:34.600> I've<00:01:34.750> got<00:01:34.960> all<00:01:35.110> of<00:01:35.140> my<00:01:35.290> red<00:01:35.650> potatoes<00:01:36.220> and

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250

and I've got all of my red potatoes and
quartered<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.360> I<00:01:38.290> put<00:01:38.740> them<00:01:38.860> on<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.280> baking

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
quartered and I put them on the baking

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:40.860 
quartered and I put them on the baking
sheet<00:01:39.910> and<00:01:39.940> like<00:01:40.240> I<00:01:40.270> said<00:01:40.570> if<00:01:40.660> you<00:01:40.780> love

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:40.870 
sheet and like I said if you love

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.920 
sheet and like I said if you love
parchment<00:01:41.380> paper<00:01:41.560> on<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.800> and<00:01:42.270> also<00:01:43.270> remember

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
parchment paper on it and also remember

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.390 
parchment paper on it and also remember
before<00:01:44.080> you<00:01:44.229> quarter<00:01:44.620> your<00:01:44.770> potatoes<00:01:45.160> make

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:45.400 
before you quarter your potatoes make

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.980 
before you quarter your potatoes make
sure<00:01:45.610> you<00:01:45.760> give<00:01:45.940> them<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.180> nice<00:01:46.360> scrubbing

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
sure you give them a nice scrubbing

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.760 
sure you give them a nice scrubbing
under<00:01:47.770> cool<00:01:48.100> running<00:01:48.270> tap<00:01:49.270> water<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:50.500> you<00:01:50.590> get

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
under cool running tap water so you get

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.650 
under cool running tap water so you get
all<00:01:50.860> the<00:01:51.010> dirt<00:01:51.220> off<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.700> outside<00:01:52.180> or<00:01:52.420> anything

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
all the dirt off the outside or anything

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.210 
all the dirt off the outside or anything
you<00:01:52.990> know<00:01:53.110> you<00:01:53.320> don't<00:01:53.530> want<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:53.710> be<00:01:53.800> eating<00:01:54.070> and

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
you know you don't want to be eating and

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.570 
you know you don't want to be eating and
now<00:01:55.150> I've<00:01:55.420> got<00:01:55.690> a<00:01:55.720> tablespoon<00:01:56.440> of<00:01:57.040> canola<00:01:57.310> oil

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:57.580 
now I've got a tablespoon of canola oil

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.880 
now I've got a tablespoon of canola oil
and<00:01:58.060> I'm<00:01:58.540> going<00:01:58.660> to<00:01:58.750> drizzle<00:01:59.080> this<00:01:59.380> over<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
and I'm going to drizzle this over the

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.969 
and I'm going to drizzle this over the
potatoes<00:02:00.369> and<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.840> reason<00:02:02.200> I<00:02:02.350> do<00:02:02.410> this<00:02:02.680> on<00:02:02.890> the

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
potatoes and the reason I do this on the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:05.219 
potatoes and the reason I do this on the
baking<00:02:03.280> pan<00:02:03.460> is<00:02:03.820> because<00:02:04.300> if<00:02:04.780> you<00:02:04.960> do<00:02:05.080> in<00:02:05.200> a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
baking pan is because if you do in a

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.560
