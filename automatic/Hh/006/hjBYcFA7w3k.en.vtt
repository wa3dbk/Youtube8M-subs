they<00:02:39.640> were<00:02:39.700> really<00:02:39.970> tight<00:02:40.360> I<00:02:40.480> took<00:02:40.540> them<00:02:40.780> out

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
they were really tight I took them out

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.260 
they were really tight I took them out
simply<00:02:41.170> because<00:02:41.320> I<00:02:41.560> was<00:02:41.710> going<00:02:41.830> out<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.850> they

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
simply because I was going out and they

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.300 
simply because I was going out and they
were<00:02:43.330> really<00:02:43.690> tight<00:02:43.930> curls<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.710> didn't<00:02:45.100> really

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
were really tight curls I didn't really

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.630 
were really tight curls I didn't really
like<00:02:45.430> it<00:02:45.490> but<00:02:46.000> I<00:02:46.060> dealt<00:02:46.510> with<00:02:46.570> it<00:02:47.100> so<00:02:48.100> yeah<00:02:48.460> they

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
like it but I dealt with it so yeah they

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.040 
like it but I dealt with it so yeah they
were<00:02:48.700> really<00:02:48.850> tight<00:02:49.150> curls<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:49.750> can<00:02:49.870> hurt<00:02:49.990> a

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
were really tight curls so it can hurt a

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.790 
were really tight curls so it can hurt a
curl<00:02:50.380> it<00:02:50.830> can<00:02:51.010> hold<00:02:51.160> a<00:02:51.340> curl<00:02:51.640> obviously<00:02:52.710> so

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:55.800 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.240 

after<00:02:56.800> that<00:02:57.960> a<00:02:58.960> couple<00:02:59.440> days<00:02:59.560> later<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.010> was

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
do a braided pinup so that's pretty much

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.330 
do a braided pinup so that's pretty much
what<00:03:33.520> I've<00:03:33.640> had<00:03:34.090> in<00:03:34.240> my<00:03:34.360> head<00:03:34.630> since<00:03:35.130> not<00:03:36.130> just

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:36.340 
what I've had in my head since not just

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.980 
what I've had in my head since not just
a<00:03:36.400> braid<00:03:36.550> out<00:03:36.580> today<00:03:37.120> so<00:03:37.450> you<00:03:37.600> see<00:03:37.810> if<00:03:37.900> you

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
think at the bottom is simply the wave

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.810 
think at the bottom is simply the wave
from<00:03:42.070> the<00:03:42.190> braid
