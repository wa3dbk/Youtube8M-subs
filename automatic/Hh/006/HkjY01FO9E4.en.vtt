00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 Hello friends with you, Yaroslav 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:13.740
 Shalashov and today we manage the two - headed 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:16.830
 monster bf-109 z zwilling so zwilling 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.650
 German and mean twins do not need 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.609
 explain probably what it means guys 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.140
 from the Luftwaffe took yes and glued 2 bf-109 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:27.480
 what was it done for? 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.090
 get very easy and just heavy 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.460
 fighter or bomber looking 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.520
 what you need without breaking 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.290
 the production process they are not but not 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.540
 they needed to build a new plant they 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.340
 just put a beam between the two 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.230
 aircraft 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.420
 how would you test turned out that all 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.489
 they did great tests on henkel 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
 and a few years earlier but this one they 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.230
 the plane did not have time to finish so you 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.559
 you can only fly on it in 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.350
 the game 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.930
 well, like on any fighter we are in 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.719
 peacetime live and so we scored 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.399
 the height necessary for every heavy 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.780
 fighter in order to 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:09.479
 violently fall on the enemy violently 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
 collapse failed you watched yourself 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.939
 bf-109 bit target 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.470
 gustav short attacks but understand that 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.460
 if you follow him, it will all end 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.439
 tears so we go down to the ground 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.110
 dodge spirals from shells 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.230
 the enemy and look in a quarrel who 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.090
 who are we 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:36.270
 he polish a lot of his 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.760
 the enemy is even on the ground 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:43.480
 consider who would whom 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.630
 shoot a la 7 fly here so much 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.250
 quickly that it is impossible to reach him 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.230
 don't forget that heavy fighters are not 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.150
 very maneuverable so try 

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:55.570
 come in this way over the top 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.600
 let arc write climb 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.740
 taller and then sit down the guy on the tail and 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.860
 here's a spitfire heading to the hangar 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.930
 calmly 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.630
 rest we gain altitude we leave from the fire 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:13.390
 I remind you that if you shoot the rear then 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:15.400
 you gain height with the enemy will 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:18.010
 less likely to break as he has 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.860
 scatter increases here again 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:23.980
 describe the arc well, a little bit here from Sasha 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.740
 afraid of the fact that it was necessary to fly 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.050
 still closer guns it's good but they 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.180
 quickly overheat better here with 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.350
 up close for sure here 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.709
 something like this 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.200
 beat in fact I am not always 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.180
 I recommend to tie about such shunting 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.310
 the battle for the heavy fighter is still not 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.830
 characteristic situation if you are in every way 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:46.690
 on the tail you will be knocked down but in this 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.910
 situations we did not sit on the tail and for this 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.930
 we pick you up 7 by canon but us not 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.489
 pays attention here you water 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.230
 Messerschmitt 410 is one of the most 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.360
 dangerous opponents for us 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.370
 powerful gun fast enough 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.730
 he can reach us on top 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.880
 but the little guy was wrong here decided with 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.090
 us head to head hit our heap 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:14.500
 Allies for this is my total punishment + 1 frag 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:17.530
 has 4 downed aircraft in general as well, there 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.690
 pie eat eat another guy 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:22.360
 just because here he fell from under 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:24.640
 arm but again remind shunting 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.580
 fights this is not for heavy fighters 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.980
 try to do this only if you 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.810
 allowed and allowed to do it like here in 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.580
 this fight and now we have the last 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.740
 the opponent is very important 

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.940
 and messerschmitt bf-109g last 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.220
 dangerous for us since we don't have 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:45.610
 rear machine gun and he can all resemblance 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.890
 just destroy but let's say right to him 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:49.600
 there is no luck aiming mode 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.680
 several hits 

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:56.950
 natural victory can be congratulated 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:01.650
 computer pilot and I wish you friends 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:01.650
 Good luck to all the battles yet
