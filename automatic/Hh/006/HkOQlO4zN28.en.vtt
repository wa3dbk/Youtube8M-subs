00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.610
 makeup inspired by leopards 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:25.180
 ideal for this carnival 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.660
 so I'm going to show you your step process 

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.660
 Step 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.010
 for the eyes I'm using a pair 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.230
 of circles is in blue color out there 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:39.170
 I leave the information for you to visit the 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.970
 video so with our face clean 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:45.160
 we apply our liquid base 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.510
 and the scattered we go with small 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.760
 taps 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:52.969
 with a concealer some lighter shades 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:56.809
 that our skin is going to be applied in 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:59.180
 the dotted area filling and what 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.769
 We extend with our hands clean or 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.769
 with a brush of synthetic bristles 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:11.580
 in a sponge we apply makeup 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.700
 facial in white tone and we place it in 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.979
 the area of ​​the nose and we draw a 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.979
 reverse triangle on our forehead 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.770
 we apply this same painting in the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:29.399
 bottom of our cheek and 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.399
 we blur 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:39.090
 with a contouring we make mouth of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:39.090
 fish and we apply it in that area going down 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.580
 delimiting the white zone we blur 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:50.800
 the product 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:54.130
 and we also define face 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.360
 so with a tiny brush we're going to 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.360
 profile the nose 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.080
 and we correct with our fingers 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:08.380
 for the eyes we apply primer to 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.780
 shadows here are the shadows that I'm going to 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.720
 use in the description I leave you the 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.360
 tones for anything you can use 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:18.610
 the one you have at home we started 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.090
 applying on the golden mobile eyelid 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 Clear 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:28.230
 and then we apply a medium coffee 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.230
 blurring the two tones 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:37.040
 and to deepen we occupy one more coffee 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.040
 dark making a tuxedo 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.379
 we apply the last shadow in the part 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:51.450
 below the eye and white shadow on the 

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:54.540
 lower part of the eyebrow 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:58.019
 we make a small list with the same 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:01.379
 white shadow and we limit ourselves with the 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:04.050
 darker shadow we also put a 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:08.310
 triangulite in the part of the lacrimal and 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:13.069
 we delineated with the darkest coffee 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:13.069
 we apply black liquid eyeliner 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:18.330
 we apply generously mascara on 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.180
 tabs 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:24.110
 let dry glue for 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 eyelashes and we apply them in the part 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:32.670
 external eye with a brown pencil 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.250
 we delineate the middle of the eyebrow and with a 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:37.560
 black facial paint we finish that 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:41.780
 delineated 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:44.540
 and we make a line below the eyebrow 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:48.140
 and we extend it by closing the triangle 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.069
 white with our hands we blur the 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.469
 black 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.850
 and to give you more depth we are going to 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:04:00.260
 occupy the middle and golden coffee 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.720
 to mark it in that area 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.420
 with the middle shadow we are going to make some 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.360
 small dots dotted and different 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.220
 sizes 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.220
 simulating leopard spots 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:17.880
 and with the black facial paint we close 

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:22.290
 the circles of leopard spots 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.290
 I leave you the technique 

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.650
 does not have to be perfect this is the 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:36.650
 wonder in this makeup 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:43.660
 nature is not perfect not much 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:43.660
 less symmetric 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:53.360
 and we put small dots to decorate 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:05:01.730
 we reinforce the delineation of the eyes if 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.730
 you consider that it was very small 

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:08.690
 and for the labial lips and 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.690
 his tone 38 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:15.780
 a lip gloss in golden litmus 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.250
 to finish the look I applied some 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.630
 long earrings out there I leave you so that 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:28.870
