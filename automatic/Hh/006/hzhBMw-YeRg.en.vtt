in a make-believe scenario it's just

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.770

wanted<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:03.130> I<00:03:03.250> didn't<00:03:03.490> actually<00:03:03.580> affect<00:03:04.030> them

00:03:04.229 --> 00:03:04.239 
wanted and I didn't actually affect them

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:05.309 
wanted and I didn't actually affect them
I<00:03:04.300> think<00:03:04.360> they<00:03:04.569> really<00:03:04.780> did<00:03:04.870> feel<00:03:05.080> like<00:03:05.110> it<00:03:05.200> was

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
I think they really did feel like it was

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.809 
I think they really did feel like it was
real<00:03:05.530> a<00:03:05.560> lot<00:03:05.650> of<00:03:05.860> us<00:03:05.950> actually<00:03:06.100> have<00:03:06.310> kids<00:03:06.700> the

00:03:06.809 --> 00:03:06.819 
real a lot of us actually have kids the

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:08.220 
real a lot of us actually have kids the
same<00:03:06.970> age<00:03:07.150> some<00:03:07.360> of<00:03:07.420> the<00:03:07.540> firefighters<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:08.170> I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
same age some of the firefighters and I

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.270 
same age some of the firefighters and I
think<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.470> was<00:03:08.560> really<00:03:08.739> tough<00:03:08.920> on<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.100> lot<00:03:09.220> of

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
think it was really tough on a lot of

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.470 
think it was really tough on a lot of
them<00:03:09.459> to<00:03:09.580> deal<00:03:09.730> with<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:09.970> children<00:03:10.360> and

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
them to deal with the children and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.460 
them to deal with the children and
actually<00:03:10.780> do<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:10.930> but<00:03:11.110> they<00:03:11.200> did<00:03:11.350> an

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
actually do that but they did an

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.559 
actually do that but they did an
excellent<00:03:11.739> job<00:03:12.120> this<00:03:13.120> is<00:03:13.209> going<00:03:13.360> to<00:03:13.420> be<00:03:13.480> an

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:13.569
