00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:22.250 
a boat leg from a very old Clinton motor

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.300 
a boat leg from a very old Clinton motor
it<00:00:23.250> has<00:00:23.519> a<00:00:23.550> custom<00:00:24.560> propeller<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.920> I<00:00:25.949> made

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
it has a custom propeller that I made

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.439 
it has a custom propeller that I made
out<00:00:26.340> of<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.970> hub<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:28.519> another<00:00:29.519> propeller<00:00:30.060> and

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
out of a hub and another propeller and

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.889 
out of a hub and another propeller and
this<00:00:30.689> is<00:00:30.840> JB<00:00:31.140> weld<00:00:31.590> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:31.949> middle<00:00:32.899> fitting

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
this is JB weld in the middle fitting

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.569 
this is JB weld in the middle fitting
the<00:00:33.989> two<00:00:34.170> together<00:00:34.350> it's<00:00:34.770> pretty<00:00:35.040> precise

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the two together it's pretty precise

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.900 
the two together it's pretty precise
when<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.390> spins<00:00:36.780> you<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.410> you<00:00:38.250> can<00:00:38.430> tell<00:00:38.670> it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
when it spins you can you can tell it

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.450 
when it spins you can you can tell it
doesn't<00:00:39.420> wobble<00:00:39.750> or<00:00:40.200> anything<00:00:40.469> like<00:00:40.800> that<00:00:40.829> so

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
doesn't wobble or anything like that so

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.910 
doesn't wobble or anything like that so
I've<00:00:41.670> got<00:00:41.879> that<00:00:42.090> right<00:00:42.300> on<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.590> actually

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
I've got that right on and I actually

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.250 
I've got that right on and I actually
performed<00:00:44.340> better<00:00:45.000> once<00:00:45.809> up<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.170> this

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
performed better once up with this

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.069 
performed better once up with this

when this is off of the screw the engine

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
when this is off of the screw the engine
will<00:01:51.090> turn<00:01:51.780> off<00:01:52.049> it'll<00:01:52.470> die<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:53.130> start<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
will turn off it'll die to start the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.770 
will turn off it'll die to start the
engine<00:01:54.329> you<00:01:54.600> want<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.560> pull<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.009> on<00:01:57.000> and<00:01:57.060> attach

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
it to the screw now it's in run mode

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.240 
it to the screw now it's in run mode
so<00:02:00.690> let<00:02:00.990> me<00:02:01.020> fire<00:02:01.409> it<00:02:01.680> up<00:02:01.830> and<00:02:02.040> show<00:02:02.909> you<00:02:02.940> guys

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
so let me fire it up and show you guys

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.340 
so let me fire it up and show you guys
how<00:02:05.250> it<00:02:05.520> sounds

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
how it sounds

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.070 
how it sounds
pretty<00:02:07.350> loud<00:02:07.650> but<00:02:08.270> it's<00:02:09.270> less<00:02:09.539> noticeable

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
pretty loud but it's less noticeable

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.590 
pretty loud but it's less noticeable
when<00:02:10.350> you're<00:02:10.500> out<00:02:10.590> on<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.770> water<00:02:10.890> and

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:11.600 
when you're out on the water and

00:02:11.600 --> 00:03:02.640 
when you're out on the water and
definitely<00:02:12.600> fun<00:02:15.590> so<00:02:16.590> i'mma<00:02:16.709> start<00:02:17.010> it<00:02:17.220> up

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:16.860 

I<00:03:02.680> put<00:03:03.159> a<00:03:03.209> quieter<00:03:04.209> muffler<00:03:04.810> on<00:03:04.989> there

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.850 

all<00:03:17.870> right<00:03:18.170> it's<00:03:18.830> pretty<00:03:19.160> beefy<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:21.200> original

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
all right it's pretty beefy the original

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.790 
all right it's pretty beefy the original

Clinton engine that was on here was four
and<00:03:24.890> a<00:03:24.950> half<00:03:25.010> horsepower<00:03:25.810> so<00:03:26.810> I<00:03:26.840> jumped<00:03:27.379> up

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
and a half horsepower so I jumped up

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.309 
and a half horsepower so I jumped up
about<00:03:27.769> two<00:03:28.099> horsepower<00:03:28.730> with<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:29.810> Briggs<00:03:30.050> and

00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:30.319 
about two horsepower with the Briggs and

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.750 
about two horsepower with the Briggs and
Stratton<00:03:30.349> and<00:03:30.950> it<00:03:31.129> moves<00:03:31.370> pretty<00:03:31.790> good

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
Stratton and it moves pretty good

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.920
