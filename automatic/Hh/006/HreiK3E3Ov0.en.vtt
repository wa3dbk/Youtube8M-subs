in our house so that I think was a huge

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.090 
in our house so that I think was a huge
influence<00:01:08.990> of<00:01:09.470> wanting<00:01:10.159> to<00:01:11.620> play<00:01:12.620> music

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
my my job and and I've been really happy

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.430 
my my job and and I've been really happy
with<00:02:56.130> how<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:56.970> sound<00:02:57.450> blends<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.290> our

with how that sound blends with our
Orchestra<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.780> so<00:03:00.780> that's<00:03:00.959> that's<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.800> think

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:01.860 
Orchestra and so that's that's I think

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:03.979 
Orchestra and so that's that's I think
the<00:03:02.100> main<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.610> main<00:03:02.760> thing<00:03:02.970> I<00:03:03.120> just<00:03:03.150> wanted<00:03:03.750> a

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
warm beautiful rich sound and that's

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.449 
warm beautiful rich sound and that's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
a an aside but it's it's it's a good an

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.460 
a an aside but it's it's it's a good an
