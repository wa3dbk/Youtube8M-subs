a<00:00:34.620> team<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:35.219> decided<00:00:36.059> to<00:00:36.329> participate<00:00:36.620> my<00:00:37.620> time

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
a team I decided to participate my time

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.829 
a team I decided to participate my time
wasn't<00:00:38.159> the<00:00:38.399> best<00:00:38.609> but<00:00:38.760> at<00:00:38.969> least<00:00:39.149> I<00:00:39.420> think<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:39.839 
wasn't the best but at least I think I

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:41.450 
wasn't the best but at least I think I
turned<00:00:39.899> out<00:00:40.230> something<00:00:40.649> that<00:00:40.679> was<00:00:40.890> reasonable

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
turned out something that was reasonable

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.819 
turned out something that was reasonable
but<00:00:42.269> in<00:00:42.390> all<00:00:42.629> cases<00:00:42.839> they<00:00:43.170> were<00:00:43.230> somewhat

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
but in all cases they were somewhat

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.759 
but in all cases they were somewhat
rough<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:45.089> I<00:00:45.120> decided<00:00:45.809> that<00:00:45.960> when<00:00:46.289> I<00:00:46.319> returned

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
rough so I decided that when I returned

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.059 
rough so I decided that when I returned
home<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.309> needed<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:47.940> turn<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.569> real<00:00:49.069> finished

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:50.069 
home I needed to turn a real finished

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:53.329 
home I needed to turn a real finished
eggcup<00:00:50.639> one<00:00:51.479> that<00:00:51.749> actually<00:00:52.139> was<00:00:52.829> finished

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:53.339 
eggcup one that actually was finished

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.739 
eggcup one that actually was finished
sanded<00:00:54.179> and<00:00:54.530> looks<00:00:55.530> good<00:00:55.879> so<00:00:56.879> here<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.299> is<00:00:57.510> an

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:57.749 
sanded and looks good so here it is an

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:00.919 
sanded and looks good so here it is an
egg<00:00:58.350> cup<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:59.460> I<00:00:59.489> just<00:00:59.609> need<00:00:59.940> an<00:01:00.120> egg<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.600> go<00:01:00.749> in
