uh see where the majority of the players
are<00:05:40.580> where<00:05:40.940> the<00:05:41.060> spawn<00:05:41.330> in<00:05:41.540> so<00:05:41.690> you<00:05:41.780> can<00:05:41.930> kind

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:42.110 
are where the spawn in so you can kind

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:44.140 
are where the spawn in so you can kind
of<00:05:42.170> make<00:05:42.350> your<00:05:42.440> way<00:05:42.500> over<00:05:42.590> there<00:05:43.040> and<00:05:43.190> take
