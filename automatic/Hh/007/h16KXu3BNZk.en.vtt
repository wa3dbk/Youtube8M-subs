enemies on the objective and I left the

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.790 
enemies on the objective and I left the
map<00:00:35.969> there<00:00:36.239> leaving<00:00:36.930> it<00:00:37.020> as<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.290> portable

map there leaving it as a portable
transportable<00:00:38.460> which<00:00:38.610> means<00:00:38.850> you're<00:00:39.030> not<00:00:39.180> in

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
transportable which means you're not in

danger<00:00:39.480> it's<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:40.440> motion<00:00:40.920> sensor<00:00:41.040> wherever<00:00:41.910> I

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
danger it's a motion sensor wherever I

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.060 
danger it's a motion sensor wherever I
drop<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.510> I<00:00:42.660> have<00:00:42.930> eyes<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:43.920> a

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
drop it I have eyes on that in a

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.680 
drop it I have eyes on that in a
situation<00:00:44.280> because<00:00:44.969> not<00:00:45.180> only<00:00:45.210> can<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.539> ever

situation because not only can I ever

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.299 
situation because not only can I ever
trigger<00:00:46.020> into<00:00:46.289> it<00:00:46.379> to<00:00:46.469> look<00:00:46.620> at<00:00:46.770> it<00:00:46.890> again<00:00:47.129> in

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
trigger into it to look at it again in

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.920 
trigger into it to look at it again in
the<00:00:47.430> future<00:00:47.579> but<00:00:48.300> I<00:00:48.360> have<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.750> they're

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
the future but I have that they're

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.630 
the future but I have that they're
showing<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.350> rest<00:00:49.530> of<00:00:49.620> my<00:00:49.710> team<00:00:49.770> that<00:00:50.430> hey

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
showing the rest of my team that hey

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
showing the rest of my team that hey
there's<00:00:50.969> enemies<00:00:51.360> nearby<00:00:51.600> at<00:00:51.960> that<00:00:52.140> point<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
there's enemies nearby at that point it

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.049 
there's enemies nearby at that point it
is<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> motion<00:00:53.160> sensor<00:00:53.309> I<00:00:53.489> could<00:00:53.640> fly<00:00:53.699> that<00:00:53.969> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
is a motion sensor I could fly that in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:55.819 
is a motion sensor I could fly that in
the<00:00:54.149> one<00:00:54.300> heavily<00:00:54.600> populated<00:00:54.960> area<00:00:55.469> drop<00:00:55.710> it

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
the one heavily populated area drop it

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:56.779 
the one heavily populated area drop it
in<00:00:55.920> there<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.070> hopefully<00:00:56.250> it<00:00:56.489> doesn't<00:00:56.640> get

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
in there and hopefully it doesn't get

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.150 
in there and hopefully it doesn't get
shot<00:00:57.059> now<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.719> I<00:00:57.989> recommend<00:00:58.590> it<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.829> a<00:00:58.890> lot<00:00:59.039> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
shot now do I recommend it in a lot of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.889 
shot now do I recommend it in a lot of
situations<00:00:59.340> no<00:00:59.820> I'm<00:01:00.059> more<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> larger<00:01:00.719> Maps

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
situations no I'm more the larger Maps

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.319 
situations no I'm more the larger Maps
with<00:01:01.109> widespread<00:01:01.350> areas<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:03.059> know<00:01:03.180> where

with widespread areas you know where
it's<00:01:03.449> not<00:01:03.570> too<00:01:03.719> distracting<00:01:03.840> you<00:01:04.619> get<00:01:04.739> in

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
it's not too distracting you get in

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.260 
it's not too distracting you get in
those<00:01:05.010> tight<00:01:05.220> close<00:01:05.430> quarters<00:01:05.790> situations

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
those tight close quarters situations

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910 
those tight close quarters situations
with<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> ma<00:01:06.720> vie<00:01:06.900> and<00:01:07.140> you<00:01:07.380> can't<00:01:07.560> just<00:01:07.740> pop

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
with the ma vie and you can't just pop

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.350 
with the ma vie and you can't just pop
it<00:01:08.070> up<00:01:08.130> for<00:01:08.340> five<00:01:08.460> seconds<00:01:08.850> because<00:01:09.000> people

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
it up for five seconds because people

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.060 
it up for five seconds because people
tend<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.570> shoot<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.930> it<00:01:09.960> it's<00:01:10.290> kind<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.799> big<00:01:11.040> and

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
tend to shoot at it it's kind of big and

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.190 
tend to shoot at it it's kind of big and
bulky<00:01:11.430> and<00:01:11.729> kind<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.150> there<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.930> I<00:01:12.960> don't

Metro the standard motion sensor the you
know<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.229> tugs<00:01:19.470> is<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:20.159> lot<00:01:20.430> easier<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:21.240> hide

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
know the tugs is a lot easier to hide

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.960 
know the tugs is a lot easier to hide
and<00:01:21.720> you'll<00:01:21.930> be<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> doorway<00:01:22.500> or<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.729> bush

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
and you'll be on a doorway or in a bush

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.490 
and you'll be on a doorway or in a bush
or<00:01:24.180> something<00:01:24.479> like<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.659> that's<00:01:25.229> why<00:01:25.470> I

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
or something like that that's why I

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.870 
or something like that that's why I
generally<00:01:26.009> prefer<00:01:26.040> that<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.610> if<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.729> have<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
generally prefer that but if you have a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.580 
generally prefer that but if you have a
wide<00:01:27.060> open<00:01:27.090> area<00:01:27.450> you<00:01:27.840> can<00:01:27.990> fly<00:01:28.170> that<00:01:28.350> above

my<00:02:45.269> thought<00:02:45.450> on<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.780> soul<00:02:45.959> flame<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.260> did<00:02:46.410> I

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
my thought on the soul flame I did I

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.509 
my thought on the soul flame I did I
left<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.860> out<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.190> last<00:02:47.370> video

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
left that out in the last video

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.160 
left that out in the last video
intentionally<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:48.630> let<00:02:48.720> you<00:02:48.840> guys<00:02:48.930> know<00:02:49.140> about

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
it I speak highly of it but at the same

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.600 
it I speak highly of it but at the same
time<00:02:51.870> at<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.079> situational<00:02:52.860> and<00:02:53.130> it's<00:02:53.400> not

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
time at the situational and it's not

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.670 
time at the situational and it's not
near<00:02:53.880> as<00:02:53.970> valuable<00:02:54.390> in<00:02:54.540> rush<00:02:54.780> as<00:02:55.019> I<00:02:55.230> would<00:02:55.560> like

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
near as valuable in rush as I would like

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.530 
near as valuable in rush as I would like
it<00:02:55.739> to<00:02:55.920> be<00:02:55.950> there's<00:02:56.610> not<00:02:56.760> any<00:02:56.970> enough<00:02:57.150> Armin

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
it to be there's not any enough Armin

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.360 
it to be there's not any enough Armin
most<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.079> the<00:02:58.170> maps<00:02:58.410> that<00:02:58.590> are<00:02:58.650> popularly

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
most of the maps that are popularly

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.880 
most of the maps that are popularly
played<00:02:59.730> but<00:03:00.599> another<00:03:01.290> thing<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.560> want<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.739> push

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
played but another thing I want to push

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.350 
played but another thing I want to push
on<00:03:02.069> to<00:03:02.250> one<00:03:02.489> thing<00:03:02.670> that<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:02.849> told<00:03:03.090> you<00:03:03.239> guys

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
on to one thing that I told you guys

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.319 
on to one thing that I told you guys
about<00:03:03.420> how<00:03:03.900> was<00:03:04.829> about<00:03:05.160> aggressive<00:03:05.790> gameplay

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
about how was about aggressive gameplay

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.449 
about how was about aggressive gameplay
and<00:03:06.599> pushing<00:03:07.440> as<00:03:07.560> the<00:03:07.650> Recon<00:03:07.980> the<00:03:08.190> the

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
and pushing as the Recon the the

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.339 
and pushing as the Recon the the
objective<00:03:08.819> of<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:08.970> Recon<00:03:09.329> is<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.049> be<00:03:10.140> able<00:03:10.290> to

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
objective of the Recon is to be able to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.539 
objective of the Recon is to be able to
allow<00:03:10.500> your<00:03:10.650> teammates<00:03:10.920> to<00:03:11.010> parachute<00:03:11.370> in

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
allow your teammates to parachute in

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:12.800 
allow your teammates to parachute in
unless<00:03:12.150> you're<00:03:12.299> on<00:03:12.360> a<00:03:12.390> map<00:03:12.569> like<00:03:12.750> this

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:12.810 
unless you're on a map like this

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.750 
unless you're on a map like this
therefore<00:03:13.560> the<00:03:13.709> only<00:03:13.799> time<00:03:14.099> the<00:03:14.250> Recon<00:03:14.579> could

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
therefore the only time the Recon could

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.430 
therefore the only time the Recon could
be<00:03:14.849> valuable<00:03:14.970> is<00:03:15.360> if<00:03:15.720> you're<00:03:15.840> able<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.200> flank

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
be valuable is if you're able to flank

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.780 
be valuable is if you're able to flank
and<00:03:16.620> get<00:03:16.739> behind<00:03:17.010> the<00:03:17.129> enemy<00:03:17.250> if<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.549> can<00:03:17.670> put

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
and get behind the enemy if you can put

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.309 
and get behind the enemy if you can put
down<00:03:17.879> the<00:03:18.000> portable<00:03:18.329> uterus<00:03:18.630> and<00:03:18.840> a<00:03:18.930> prime

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
down the portable uterus and a prime

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.490 
down the portable uterus and a prime
location<00:03:19.760> you<00:03:20.760> have<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.000> personal<00:03:21.840> spawn<00:03:22.170> point

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
location you have a personal spawn point

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.930 
location you have a personal spawn point
for<00:03:22.680> your<00:03:22.769> squad<00:03:23.100> to<00:03:23.310> get<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.579> there<00:03:23.760> and<00:03:23.790> do

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
for your squad to get in there and do

what they need to do now another thing
you're<00:03:26.190> noticing<00:03:26.459> is<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.880> am<00:03:27.000> taking<00:03:27.150> use<00:03:27.510> of

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
you're noticing is I am taking use of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.539 
you're noticing is I am taking use of
the<00:03:27.900> m4<00:03:28.200> 17<00:03:28.620> which<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.950> the<00:03:29.069> weapon<00:03:29.400> that<00:03:29.430> i

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
the m4 17 which is the weapon that i

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.190 
the m4 17 which is the weapon that i
recommend<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.299> SKS<00:03:30.810> is<00:03:30.840> slightly

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
recommend the SKS is slightly

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.229 
recommend the SKS is slightly
understanded<00:03:31.889> compared<00:03:32.250> to<00:03:32.340> this<00:03:32.459> one<00:03:32.519> the

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
understanded compared to this one the

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.240 
understanded compared to this one the
you<00:03:33.900> have<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.200> compensate<00:03:34.500> for<00:03:34.859> the<00:03:34.920> recoil

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
you have to compensate for the recoil

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.770 
you have to compensate for the recoil
the<00:03:35.400> recoil<00:03:36.000> on<00:03:36.120> those<00:03:36.239> two<00:03:36.359> weapons<00:03:36.690> are

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
the recoil on those two weapons are

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.440 
the recoil on those two weapons are
entirely<00:03:37.049> different<00:03:37.560> the<00:03:38.489> m4<00:03:38.760> 17<00:03:39.060> has<00:03:39.209> a<00:03:39.239> lot

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
entirely different the m4 17 has a lot

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.030 
entirely different the m4 17 has a lot
of<00:03:39.480> vertical<00:03:39.690> recoil<00:03:40.019> it's<00:03:40.349> got<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> lot<00:03:40.650> of<00:03:40.709> hop

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
of vertical recoil it's got a lot of hop

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.949 
of vertical recoil it's got a lot of hop
on<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.430> so<00:03:41.670> basically<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.329> first<00:03:42.480> shot<00:03:42.750> needs

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
on it so basically the first shot needs

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.839 
on it so basically the first shot needs
to<00:03:43.079> count<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.349> it's<00:03:43.440> not<00:03:43.560> a<00:03:43.590> headshot<00:03:44.040> aim<00:03:44.459> low

00:03:44.839 --> 00:03:44.849 
to count if it's not a headshot aim low

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:47.809 
to count if it's not a headshot aim low
i'm<00:03:45.120> talking<00:03:45.299> like<00:03:45.540> genital<00:03:46.109> region<00:03:46.980> you<00:03:47.609> want

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
i'm talking like genital region you want

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.099 
i'm talking like genital region you want
to<00:03:47.880> get<00:03:47.970> the<00:03:48.060> torso<00:03:48.419> shot<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.840> you're<00:03:48.959> going<00:03:49.049> to

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
to get the torso shot so you're going to

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.900 
to get the torso shot so you're going to
have<00:03:49.169> to<00:03:49.319> keep<00:03:49.440> aiming<00:03:49.950> lower<00:03:50.370> than<00:03:50.639> what<00:03:50.760> your

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
have to keep aiming lower than what your

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.339 
have to keep aiming lower than what your
mind<00:03:51.090> would<00:03:51.269> make<00:03:51.419> you<00:03:51.540> think<00:03:51.569> I<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.109> you're

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
mind would make you think I know you're

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:53.569 
mind would make you think I know you're
used<00:03:52.500> to<00:03:52.590> anything<00:03:52.739> for<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:53.010> body<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.370> head

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:53.579 
used to anything for the body and head

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:55.520 
used to anything for the body and head
but<00:03:54.090> when<00:03:54.180> you<00:03:54.269> start<00:03:54.540> shooting<00:03:54.870> especially

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
but when you start shooting especially

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.339 
but when you start shooting especially
you<00:03:55.739> know<00:03:55.829> rapid<00:03:56.220> fire<00:03:56.459> with<00:03:56.609> the<00:03:56.700> 417<00:03:57.329> and<00:03:57.569> not

00:03:58.339 --> 00:03:58.349 
you know rapid fire with the 417 and not

00:03:58.349 --> 00:03:59.720 
you know rapid fire with the 417 and not
going<00:03:58.500> to<00:03:58.560> work<00:03:58.709> so<00:03:58.950> that<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.310> my<00:03:59.430> long-range

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
going to work so that is my long-range

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.520 
going to work so that is my long-range
medium<00:04:00.299> a<00:04:00.389> long-range<00:04:00.660> weapon<00:04:01.049> a<00:04:01.109> choice<00:04:01.290> for

you guys like I said bold actions should

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.360 
you guys like I said bold actions should
be<00:04:03.599> a<00:04:03.720> no-no<00:04:04.139> with<00:04:04.440> suppression<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.220> many

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
be a no-no with suppression so many

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.680 
be a no-no with suppression so many
other<00:04:05.519> factors<00:04:05.730> in<00:04:06.030> there<00:04:06.180> slow<00:04:06.359> rate<00:04:06.540> of<00:04:06.569> fire
