nice let's turn around come on back

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.350 
nice let's turn around come on back
let's<00:00:40.399> try<00:00:40.520> to<00:00:40.579> minimize<00:00:40.969> that<00:00:41.090> ground

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
let's try to minimize that ground

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.459 
let's try to minimize that ground
contact<00:00:41.780> time<00:00:41.989> okay

00:00:42.459 --> 00:00:42.469

job<00:00:47.629> and<00:00:48.620> as<00:00:48.769> you<00:00:48.920> get<00:00:49.039> more<00:00:49.249> explosive<00:00:49.940> that

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
job and as you get more explosive that

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:57.270 
job and as you get more explosive that
ground<00:00:50.749> contact<00:00:50.989> on<00:00:51.289> will<00:00:51.440> be<00:00:51.469> minimized

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.490 

now<00:00:57.910> we're<00:00:58.060> going<00:00:58.150> to<00:00:58.210> go<00:00:58.390> into<00:00:58.600> a<00:00:58.750> combination

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
now we're going to go into a combination

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.140 
now we're going to go into a combination
movement<00:00:59.860> or<00:00:59.950> communist<00:01:00.370> planet<00:01:00.640> we're<00:01:01.030> gonna

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.150 
movement or communist planet we're gonna

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.300 
movement or communist planet we're gonna
combine<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.510> long<00:01:01.900> jump<00:01:02.200> and<00:01:02.410> a<00:01:02.800> vertical<00:01:03.040> jump

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:03.310 
combine a long jump and a vertical jump

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.920 
combine a long jump and a vertical jump
we're<00:01:03.520> going<00:01:03.640> to<00:01:03.700> face<00:01:03.880> them<00:01:04.030> there<00:01:04.239> by

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
we're going to face them there by

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.260 
we're going to face them there by
Britney<00:01:05.410> come<00:01:05.590> up<00:01:05.680> close<00:01:05.950> here<00:01:06.190> let's<00:01:06.970> go<00:01:07.090> do<00:01:07.240> a

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
Britney come up close here let's go do a

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.210 
Britney come up close here let's go do a
long<00:01:07.960> jump<00:01:07.990> or<00:01:08.530> than<00:01:08.650> that<00:01:08.770> as<00:01:08.890> soon<00:01:09.070> as<00:01:09.160> she

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 
long jump or than that as soon as she

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.800 
long jump or than that as soon as she
hit<00:01:09.550> she's<00:01:10.000> gonna<00:01:10.150> do<00:01:10.300> a<00:01:10.330> vertical<00:01:10.690> jump

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
hit she's gonna do a vertical jump

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:11.940 
hit she's gonna do a vertical jump
straight<00:01:11.080> up<00:01:11.140> as<00:01:11.410> if<00:01:11.530> she's<00:01:11.680> doing<00:01:11.890> an

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:11.950 
straight up as if she's doing an

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.540 
straight up as if she's doing an
overhead<00:01:12.250> smash<00:01:12.430> okay<00:01:16.950> good<00:01:17.950> and<00:01:18.190> we<00:01:18.280> want<00:01:18.460> to

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:18.550 
overhead smash okay good and we want to

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.190 
overhead smash okay good and we want to
minimize<00:01:18.880> that<00:01:18.910> ground<00:01:19.300> contact<00:01:19.510> time<00:01:19.900> so<00:01:20.110> as

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
minimize that ground contact time so as

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.480 
minimize that ground contact time so as
soon<00:01:20.350> as<00:01:20.440> you<00:01:20.530> hit<00:01:20.650> she<00:01:20.830> comes<00:01:21.040> up<00:01:21.190> let's<00:01:21.370> try

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
soon as you hit she comes up let's try

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:33.639 
soon as you hit she comes up let's try
one<00:01:21.670> more<00:01:21.760> time<00:01:25.560> smoke<00:01:26.730> much<00:01:27.730> better<00:01:28.030> good

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.020 

next<00:01:34.340> thing<00:01:34.460> we're<00:01:34.579> going<00:01:34.670> to<00:01:34.729> do<00:01:34.880> is<00:01:35.000> a

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
next thing we're going to do is a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.460 
next thing we're going to do is a
vertical<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.570> a<00:01:35.600> long<00:01:35.840> jump<00:01:36.079> we're<00:01:36.320> going<00:01:36.350> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
vertical to a long jump we're going to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.130 
vertical to a long jump we're going to
combine<00:01:36.680> that<00:01:37.130> and<00:01:37.579> just<00:01:37.939> flip<00:01:38.119> it<00:01:38.240> around<00:01:38.329> so

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
combine that and just flip it around so

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.730 
combine that and just flip it around so
she'll<00:01:39.320> do<00:01:39.409> a<00:01:39.439> vertical<00:01:39.680> first<00:01:40.159> hit<00:01:41.500> long<00:01:42.500> jump

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
she'll do a vertical first hit long jump

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:50.320 
she'll do a vertical first hit long jump
okay<00:01:43.159> let's<00:01:44.030> try<00:01:44.149> that<00:01:49.060> excellent<00:01:50.060> good

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
okay let's try that excellent good

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.580 
okay let's try that excellent good

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.100 
my next version we're going to do a
lateral<00:02:18.860> hop<00:02:19.160> into<00:02:20.060> a<00:02:20.120> vertical<00:02:20.330> so<00:02:20.780> start

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
lateral hop into a vertical so start

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.650 
lateral hop into a vertical so start
here<00:02:21.440> you<00:02:21.800> have<00:02:21.920> a<00:02:22.040> base<00:02:22.310> that<00:02:22.610> will<00:02:23.000> hop<00:02:23.209> and

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
here you have a base that will hop and

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.550 
here you have a base that will hop and
then<00:02:24.410> vertical<00:02:25.030> let's<00:02:26.030> try<00:02:26.239> that<00:02:26.420> you<00:02:27.349> already

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
then vertical let's try that you already

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:28.930 
then vertical let's try that you already
technically<00:02:27.980> it's<00:02:28.099> a<00:02:28.130> lateral<00:02:28.280> jump<00:02:28.730> and<00:02:28.849> then

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
technically it's a lateral jump and then

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.309 
technically it's a lateral jump and then
we'll<00:02:29.060> turn<00:02:29.180> into<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.480> lateral<00:02:29.690> hop<00:02:29.900> it's<00:02:30.140> gonna

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
we'll turn into a lateral hop it's gonna

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.110 
we'll turn into a lateral hop it's gonna
be<00:02:30.440> more<00:02:30.620> of<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.800> one-footed<00:02:31.280> thing<00:02:31.580> alright

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
be more of a one-footed thing alright

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:40.860 
be more of a one-footed thing alright
set<00:02:35.200> good<00:02:36.200> let's<00:02:36.680> go<00:02:36.769> back<00:02:36.920> the<00:02:37.040> other<00:02:37.069> way

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.839 

just<00:02:41.870> now<00:02:42.440> we're<00:02:42.560> gonna<00:02:42.650> turn<00:02:42.890> into<00:02:43.280> a<00:02:43.310> pure

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
just now we're gonna turn into a pure

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:53.380 
just now we're gonna turn into a pure
hop<00:02:44.090> we'll<00:02:44.870> start<00:02:45.140> here<00:02:45.670> hop<00:02:47.050> Bert<00:02:52.180> good<00:02:53.180> and

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
hop we'll start here hop Bert good and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.539 
hop we'll start here hop Bert good and
the<00:02:53.480> other<00:02:53.630> way<00:02:53.950> pushing<00:02:54.950> off<00:02:55.130> one<00:02:55.370> leg

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
the other way pushing off one leg

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:58.300 
the other way pushing off one leg
landing<00:02:55.970> on<00:02:56.030> two<00:02:56.269> into<00:02:56.750> the<00:02:56.840> vert<00:02:57.019> a<00:02:57.310> more

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
landing on two into the vert a more

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.490 
landing on two into the vert a more
advanced<00:02:58.640> movement<00:02:59.150> which<00:02:59.930> most<00:03:00.260> of<00:03:00.380> our

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:00.500 
advanced movement which most of our

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:01.600 
advanced movement which most of our
athletes<00:03:00.769> will<00:03:00.890> not<00:03:01.100> get<00:03:01.250> into<00:03:01.400> in<00:03:01.549> the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
athletes will not get into in the

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:04.270 
athletes will not get into in the
beginning<00:03:01.970> with<00:03:02.390> the<00:03:02.540> all<00:03:02.569> single<00:03:03.110> leg<00:03:03.290> or<00:03:03.590> ha

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
beginning with the all single leg or ha

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.780 
beginning with the all single leg or ha
and<00:03:04.580> then<00:03:05.360> Evert<00:03:05.660> which<00:03:06.049> is<00:03:06.200> more<00:03:06.380> advanced

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:12.790 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.460 

our<00:03:13.599> next<00:03:13.900> one<00:03:14.019> we're<00:03:14.170> going<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.319> do<00:03:14.440> a

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:14.470 
our next one we're going to do a

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.930 
our next one we're going to do a
combination<00:03:14.830> we're<00:03:15.099> gonna<00:03:15.220> do<00:03:15.310> a<00:03:15.340> lateral<00:03:15.580> hop

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
combination we're gonna do a lateral hop

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.780 
combination we're gonna do a lateral hop
right<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.930> will<00:03:17.080> hop<00:03:17.260> left<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:17.860> then<00:03:18.519> a<00:03:18.549> long

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
right that will hop left and then a long

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:19.699 
right that will hop left and then a long
jump

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:19.709 
jump

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:22.199 
jump
so<00:03:20.709> hop<00:03:20.950> right<00:03:21.250> hop<00:03:21.760> left

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
so hop right hop left

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.670 
so hop right hop left
plugs<00:03:22.510> up<00:03:22.720> one<00:03:23.200> foot<00:03:23.819> ready<00:03:26.040> up<00:03:27.209> huh<00:03:28.349> long<00:03:29.349> jump

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
plugs up one foot ready up huh long jump

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.259 
plugs up one foot ready up huh long jump
and<00:03:29.890> now<00:03:30.160> let's<00:03:30.400> try<00:03:30.549> to<00:03:30.610> increase<00:03:30.879> the<00:03:31.030> speed

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
and now let's try to increase the speed

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.759 
and now let's try to increase the speed
because<00:03:31.810> remember<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.319> objects<00:03:32.680> in

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
because remember the objects in

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.650 
because remember the objects in
plyometrics<00:03:33.040> is<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.910> decrease<00:03:34.299> amount<00:03:34.540> of

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
plyometrics is the decrease amount of

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.509 
plyometrics is the decrease amount of
time<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.989> on<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> ground<00:03:35.470> that<00:03:36.250> stretched

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
time is on the ground that stretched

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:38.100 
time is on the ground that stretched
shortening<00:03:36.879> cycle<00:03:37.060> has<00:03:37.299> to<00:03:37.330> be<00:03:37.420> quick<00:03:37.720> it's

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
shortening cycle has to be quick it's

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.080 
shortening cycle has to be quick it's
like<00:03:38.200> a<00:03:38.230> check<00:03:38.500> mark<00:03:38.680> ready<00:03:39.459> go<00:03:41.340> nice<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:42.700> like

like a check mark ready go nice I like

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.770 
like a check mark ready go nice I like
that<00:03:43.120> a<00:03:43.299> lot<00:03:43.420> better

quick quick quick much better notice the

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.900 
quick quick quick much better notice the
difference<00:04:12.500> in<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.650> speed<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.340> the<00:04:13.700> amount

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:13.910 
difference in the speed and the amount

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.100 
difference in the speed and the amount
of<00:04:14.150> time<00:04:14.420> that<00:04:14.600> she<00:04:14.630> was<00:04:14.810> on<00:04:14.960> the<00:04:15.080> ground

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:15.110 
of time that she was on the ground

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:16.990 
of time that she was on the ground
between<00:04:15.650> the<00:04:15.800> first<00:04:16.070> forward<00:04:16.340> and<00:04:16.580> then<00:04:16.910> the

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
between the first forward and then the

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.940 
between the first forward and then the
hop<00:04:17.150> back<00:04:17.420> was<00:04:17.900> a<00:04:17.930> lot<00:04:18.200> less<00:04:18.470> that's<00:04:18.769> what

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:18.950 
hop back was a lot less that's what

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:20.350 
hop back was a lot less that's what
we're<00:04:19.040> looking<00:04:19.250> for<00:04:19.400> the<00:04:19.820> ability<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.150> put

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
we're looking for the ability to put

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.460 
we're looking for the ability to put
force<00:04:20.600> on<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.780> ground<00:04:20.959> and<00:04:21.049> getting<00:04:21.230> out<00:04:21.380> of

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
force on the ground and getting out of

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.780 
force on the ground and getting out of
the<00:04:21.530> ground<00:04:21.770> is<00:04:22.010> what<00:04:22.250> we're<00:04:22.490> after<00:04:22.610> with

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:22.790 
the ground is what we're after with

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.420 
the ground is what we're after with
plyometric<00:04:23.390> training
