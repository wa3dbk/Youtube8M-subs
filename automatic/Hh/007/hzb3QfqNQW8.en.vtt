Okay, well good evening everybody and
welcome to the Department of Chemistry.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.249
This lecture then we are looking at
Group One of the periodic table. Now of

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:27.689
course everything around us is made up
of the elements and there are many

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.191
elements, so here are a few elements. So
we have for instance oxygen of course

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.180
aluminium, calcium. All these are common elements (carbon, nitrogen) but there are

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.809
many, many elements, we're going to be here quite some time at this rate. There's

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:47.969
over a hundred different elements. Here
they all are in some rather random order.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.859
Remember these make up everything around
us, in some form or another.

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.899
How can we make sense of all these
elements?

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.160
Well the first person that did this, that
actually made some sense of the

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.040
different elements, was this chap.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.930
Dmitri Mendeleev, a Russian and he
first proposed the periodic table of the

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.130
elements and this is our starting point
for today. We're going to be looking at

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.030
one family of elements within the
periodic table or a group.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.350
We're going to be looking at Group One.
Now this is the red group, coloured here

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.600
We'll look at hydrogen at the start, then lithium,
sodium, potassium, rubidium, and caesium. So

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
Mendeleev arranged all the elements in
order of, well he arranged them in order of

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.979
increasing atomic weight, that's not
quite how it should be but that's not

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:39.659
quite the real point of the periodic
table, as we shall see shortly, but he

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.939
also, this was his key stroke of genius,
arranged them into groups with

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.930
related properties and the groups are
shown vertically like this. So this is

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.399
group 1, we have group 2 here. Another
family with similar properties, group 3

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.649
or thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen,
seventeen, eighteen. These ones are

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.369
the noble gases for instance, all of
these are gases. So within each group

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.570
they have similar properties. We sort of
skipped over these ones in the middle,

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.759
these are called the transition metals.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.759
Ok, so these include things like iron,
copper,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.370
nickel and so on. These are common metals
there in the transition metals and we

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.939
also glossed over these ones down the
bottom there. They're sort of squeezed in

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:23.579
where you see those flashing symbols.

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.150
This would make the periodic table far
too long, so usually they're cut out and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.439
put at the bottom instead.

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.730
But we're going to focus on group one.
Here they are group 1.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.030
Now what do they have in common? This is
the important point.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.299
What all these things have in common?
Well to understand this we need to look

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:46.739
at the atomic structure. So let's start
off with the first atom, hydrogen. So

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.700
hydrogen consists of a proton and the
proton is coloured red here.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.019
The proton has a positive charge and
this is balanced by the same number of

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.659
electrons. The electrons are shown in
yellow.

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:01.739
So the electron is whizzing around the
the nucleus. The nucleus is made up of

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.299
protons and neutrons. The hydrogen atom though doesn't usually have any neutrons. The

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:09.840
number of neutrons varies. Neutrons have
no charge

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.040
but we can have different
numbers in the same sort of atoms. So

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.129
we're really interested in the number of
protons and electrons.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.389
Now as we move across the periodic table
from one element to the next, the number

00:03:21.389 --> 00:03:26.010
of electrons and protons increases by
one. We add one extra proton, positive

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.169
charge, in the nucleus and one extra
electron to keep it neutral. So here we are,

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:32.159
this is helium.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.269
We've got one extra electron. Now the
next key point is that we start adding

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.010
electrons into different shells.

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:42.329
So for the next element lithium with
three electrons in total it has just one

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.590
electron in its outermost shell, moving
around as you see, moving around

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.900
far away from the central
nucleus. But then we move across again we

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.979
add an extra proton, an extra electron. So
beryllium here in group 2 has two

00:03:55.979 --> 00:04:00.810
electrons in its outermost shell. Boron
has three electrons in its outermost

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:09.659
shell. Carbon here has four. Nitrogen has
five electrons. Oxygen has six electrons

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.879
in its outermost shell. Fluorine has
seven electrons in its outermost shell.

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:18.269
There's 2 in the middle as well, so it's nine
in total, but seven in the outermost

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.289
shell. Neon has eight in the outermost
shell and that's full up now.

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.160
So now the next electron that we have

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.690
to add goes into a new shell and this is
where we get back to sodium the next one

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.740
in Group 1.
