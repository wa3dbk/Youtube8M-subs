00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
drive this car because I think it you

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.420 
drive this car because I think it you
know<00:01:35.909> Jeff<00:01:36.290> is<00:01:37.290> really<00:01:37.650> connecting<00:01:38.159> with<00:01:38.189> the

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
know Jeff is really connecting with the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.670 
know Jeff is really connecting with the
energy<00:01:38.579> and<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.329> flow<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.049> intention<00:01:40.619> of

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
energy and the flow and the intention of

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.200 
energy and the flow and the intention of
the<00:01:40.799> car<00:01:41.009> and<00:01:41.100> I<00:01:41.189> think<00:01:41.400> as<00:01:41.549> a<00:01:41.579> racing<00:01:42.060> driver

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the car and I think as a racing driver

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.710 
the car and I think as a racing driver
it's<00:01:42.930> all<00:01:43.200> about<00:01:43.229> channeling<00:01:43.920> energy<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
it's all about channeling energy and

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.530 
it's all about channeling energy and
making<00:01:45.720> sure<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> your<00:01:46.229> performance<00:01:46.829> is

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:47.540 
making sure that your performance is

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.940 
making sure that your performance is
optimized<00:01:48.540> at<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.869> right<00:01:49.079> time<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:49.619> I<00:01:49.710> think

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
optimized at the right time and I think

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.980 
optimized at the right time and I think
this<00:01:50.549> car<00:01:50.880> well<00:01:51.180> I<00:01:51.360> know<00:01:51.420> this<00:01:51.689> cars<00:01:51.930> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
this car well I know this cars a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.889 
this car well I know this cars a
tremendous<00:01:52.500> car<00:01:52.740> the<00:01:52.860> m3<00:01:53.220> gt2<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:54.329> curves<00:01:54.659> are

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
tremendous car the m3 gt2 the curves are

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.080 
tremendous car the m3 gt2 the curves are
right<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.439> normally<00:01:56.040> when<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.250> car<00:01:56.520> looks<00:01:56.820> good

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
right and normally when a car looks good

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.950 
right and normally when a car looks good
it<00:01:57.240> goes<00:01:57.450> good<00:01:57.780> well<00:01:58.649> with<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.930> full<00:02:00.930> order

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
it goes good well with the full order

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.380 
it goes good well with the full order
Formula<00:02:01.710> One<00:02:01.890> it<00:02:02.100> was<00:02:02.340> clear<00:02:02.640> that<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:03.149> would

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
Formula One it was clear that we would

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.210 
Formula One it was clear that we would
focus<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.320> future<00:02:04.560> on
