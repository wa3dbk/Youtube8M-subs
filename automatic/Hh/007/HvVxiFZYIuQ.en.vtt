hello doc and usual suspects are back I
said<00:00:21.830> Australia<00:00:22.830> blocking<00:00:23.220> as<00:00:23.699> you<00:00:23.820> can<00:00:23.970> see

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:24.320 
said Australia blocking as you can see

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:31.630 
said Australia blocking as you can see
this<00:00:25.320> one<00:00:25.590> is<00:00:25.880> totally<00:00:26.880> totally<00:00:27.510> blocked<00:00:29.000> I

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
this one is totally totally blocked I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.630 
this one is totally totally blocked I
will<00:00:32.640> see<00:00:32.759> this<00:00:32.880> causes<00:00:33.329> blockage<00:00:34.140> which

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
will see this causes blockage which

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.869 
will see this causes blockage which
fails<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.820> feed<00:00:35.969> all<00:00:36.120> supplies<00:00:36.510> to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.899> turbo

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
fails to feed all supplies to the turbo

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.729 
fails to feed all supplies to the turbo
which<00:00:38.879> can<00:00:39.149> then<00:00:39.300> screw<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.410> engine

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
which can then screw your engine

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.310 
which can then screw your engine
basically<00:00:41.270> luckily<00:00:42.270> there's<00:00:42.660> no<00:00:42.870> knocking

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
basically luckily there's no knocking

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
basically luckily there's no knocking
hopefully<00:00:44.129> touchwood<00:00:44.610> from<00:00:45.360> what<00:00:45.539> I<00:00:45.570> could

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
hopefully touchwood from what I could

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:54.279 
hopefully touchwood from what I could
see<00:00:48.559> this<00:00:49.559> is<00:00:49.739> what<00:00:49.920> happens<00:00:52.039> look<00:00:53.039> at<00:00:53.219> that

00:00:54.279 --> 00:00:54.289 
see this is what happens look at that

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:58.099 
see this is what happens look at that
that<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.350> at<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.590> bottom<00:00:55.980> of<00:00:56.489> an<00:00:56.699> engine<00:00:57.109> there's

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
that is at a bottom of an engine there's

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:05.479 
that is at a bottom of an engine there's
got<00:00:58.289> full<00:00:58.559> Saab<00:00:59.280> service<00:00:59.820> history<00:01:04.250> it's<00:01:05.250> the

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
got full Saab service history it's the

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.620 
got full Saab service history it's the
total<00:01:06.090> disgrace

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.969 

General<00:01:09.630> Motors<00:01:09.780> should<00:01:10.170> be<00:01:10.290> ashamed<00:01:10.380> of

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
General Motors should be ashamed of

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.020 
General Motors should be ashamed of
themselves<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.700> this<00:01:12.150> design<00:01:13.340> but<00:01:14.340> as<00:01:14.760> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
themselves for this design but as you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.710 
themselves for this design but as you
can<00:01:15.150> see<00:01:15.210> there's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.689> actually<00:01:15.960> a<00:01:16.470> hole<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:18.330> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
can see there's a actually a hole in the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.280 
can see there's a actually a hole in the
strainer<00:01:19.110> itself<00:01:19.680> so<00:01:20.460> something<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.750> big<00:01:22.020> has

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
strainer itself so something so big has

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.510 
strainer itself so something so big has
gone<00:01:22.530> through<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:27.350> actually<00:01:28.350> on<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:29.250> plate

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
gone through it actually on the plate

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.560 
gone through it actually on the plate
that<00:01:29.729> covers<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.560> strainer<00:01:32.150> you<00:01:33.150> can<00:01:33.329> see

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
that covers the strainer you can see

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.120 
that covers the strainer you can see
bits<00:01:34.380> of<00:01:34.560> plastic<00:01:36.619> now<00:01:37.619> obviously<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
bits of plastic now obviously the

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.109 
bits of plastic now obviously the
breather<00:01:38.729> pipes<00:01:39.000> collapsed<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:40.009> this<00:01:41.119> then

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
breather pipes collapsed and this then

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:49.240 
breather pipes collapsed and this then
feeds<00:01:42.720> in<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:44.460> engine<00:01:45.890> which<00:01:46.890> causes

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
feeds in to the engine which causes

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.100 
feeds in to the engine which causes
major<00:01:50.250> problems<00:01:50.430> it's<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.390> bad<00:01:51.570> design<00:01:51.869> from

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
major problems it's a bad design from

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.020 
major problems it's a bad design from
Saab<00:01:53.630> that's<00:01:54.630> all<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.780> could<00:01:54.930> say<00:01:55.049> really<00:01:55.670> but<00:01:56.670> I

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
Saab that's all I could say really but I

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.420 
Saab that's all I could say really but I
always<00:01:57.329> think<00:01:57.540> that<00:01:57.770> it's<00:01:58.770> sort<00:01:59.070> of<00:01:59.130> SAP's

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
always think that it's sort of SAP's

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:02.539 
always think that it's sort of SAP's
fault<00:01:59.729> anyway<00:02:00.119> because<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:01.310> screwed<00:02:02.310> up<00:02:02.430> on

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
fault anyway because they screwed up on

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.709 
fault anyway because they screwed up on
the<00:02:02.610> service<00:02:03.530> intervals<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:05.450> think<00:02:06.450> that<00:02:06.600> if

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
the service intervals I think that if

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.100 
the service intervals I think that if
this<00:02:06.899> was<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:07.740> car<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.069> it<00:02:08.729> had<00:02:09.110> regular

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
this was the car that it had regular

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.070 
this was the car that it had regular
6,000<00:02:10.739> mile<00:02:10.920> service<00:02:11.700> intervals

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
6,000 mile service intervals

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.720 
6,000 mile service intervals
it<00:02:13.620> would<00:02:13.740> be<00:02:13.860> a<00:02:13.890> lot<00:02:14.010> better<00:02:14.040> I<00:02:14.400> mean<00:02:14.550> just

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
it would be a lot better I mean just

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.540 
it would be a lot better I mean just
look<00:02:14.880> at<00:02:15.120> that<00:02:15.330> there<00:02:15.660> I<00:02:15.960> do<00:02:16.710> not<00:02:17.160> know<00:02:17.370> what

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
look at that there I do not know what

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.060 
look at that there I do not know what
that<00:02:17.580> is<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:18.750> I<00:02:18.930> saw<00:02:19.140> that<00:02:19.350> in<00:02:19.500> the<00:02:19.530> street<00:02:19.860> I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
that is if I saw that in the street I

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.530 
that is if I saw that in the street I
would<00:02:20.190> cross<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.550> road<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.060> walk<00:02:21.210> away<00:02:21.390> from

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
would cross the road and walk away from

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.490 
would cross the road and walk away from
it<00:02:23.360> what<00:02:24.360> do<00:02:24.450> you<00:02:24.540> think<00:02:24.720> Doug<00:02:25.070> isn't<00:02:26.070> the<00:02:26.250> same
