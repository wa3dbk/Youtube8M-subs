00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.289
 hello everyone we find ourselves for 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.570
 a very first video on gta 5 this 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.730
 game so much so frankly 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.170
 it's really great it's my all 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.460
 first video but believe me you 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.830
 are going to have others he's really 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 great this game by the way I think that a 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.940
 little everybody loose religious 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.930
 she played revenge not call of minecraft 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.149
 or anything else 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.739
 he drops all to go on it but 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.440
 they are right right it's true it's 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.210
 really super frankly so I'm going 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.379
 to show you how to have the element 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.170
 firefighters where to find him 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.010
 and then I 'll show you 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.620
 of them two little things in one in one 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.149
 gameplay but little tricks 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.629
 so here it is so here it is for those who 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.760
 have already tried to escalate the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.199
 iliad sleeve and who would have fallen but 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.239
 my opinion trees to everyone but he 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.119
 is it right next to the hospital you 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.640
 respawn and so here's north of the 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.750
 card right down the iliad handle and 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.939
 so is this kid firefighters who were 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.759
 already present in gta iv with which 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.860
 you can shoot with the water lance 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.530
 so here I'll show you we can 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.330
 new iron 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:27.509
 it's quite fun besides you can 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.939
 shoot with water lances with clb on 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.729
 xbox and on ps3 I do not know at all what 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.320
 it is therefore in any case it was 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.600
 passed the trigger left apa the one 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.770
 to shoot but not to pass for 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.650
 to brake but it's power 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.420
 finally the other what shit and 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.980
 So there without deliberately small fail 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.680
 I shot the cops what made them 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:53.680
 provoked and what will you subsequently 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:57.640
 go see me finally what me how 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:02:00.850
 to say that little white what got me what 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:06.930
 I'm looking for what gave me the idea 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:10.060
 basically help with the challenge 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.380
 the famous challenge that is that everyone 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:13.390
 like I think a little bit that was 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.620
 found the first time I believe by 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.300
 dax campion others like that and so the 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.209
 challenge and climb the chillan mount with 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.700
 various vehicles so this is this 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:25.900
 technique is to help you when 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.610
 you have heavy weights stuff 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.760
 like that help you in the climbs 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.740
 so there you will see in the gameplay 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:34.930
 that I put you there that actually 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.670
 causing the cops they go during 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.959
 the climbs put yourself behind you 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.880
 and push you in you will see 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.930
 buy on the verge of calais I was 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.600
 stalling I was two fingers 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.850
 to fall back and there is a cop 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.470
 who will push me you'll see here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.739
 here literally he pushed me into 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.750
 memories the age he is stalling 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:55.600
 and hop he gave me a little bit of 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.920
 inch so that can you 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.630
 allow to go all the way up I'm 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.910
 went really far but very far 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.320
 did a little fail at the end immo have me 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.200
 dropped if they are a little weak so 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.390
 falls in the EU he often falls due from 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.920
 the mountain and so at that moment he 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.320
 had let me go so I could more 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.330
 continue but that's it for those who are 

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:15.100
 quite fond of this challenge to climb into 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.780
 top of the sleeve there are 10 can they 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.239
 can try it with this technique 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.860
 that it works a trip went pretty 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.180
 far but I got myself I got myself 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.709
 really let go and so that's it 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:28.239
 this was the first little trick 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:29.769
 fast so obviously that you can 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.680
 do it with your friends as the tool 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.730
 player will go out one but meanwhile 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.410
 finally that already with your friends will be 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.600
 much easier but there with the 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:38.709
 pics and it adds a little challenge what 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.489
 it's a little harder it's random 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.959
 in addition so here and then we will finish 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.180
 with the last little trick that this 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.580
 is not a trick it's a bug 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:51.160
 the well- known bug of the swing that has 

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.230
 already been found in the form of 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.860
 portal bugs ends with a portal 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.960
 it's in the GTA 5 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.360
 and so that's another way of 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.680
 do I confess to you that this is the 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.210
 first time and I found them 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.670
 totally by chance you can 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:06.230
 do with the train is really 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.490
 totally by chance that's it 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:08.870
 walk at this place I do not know 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.790
 when but it's still thanks to this 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.470
 project there you go see where I got 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:14.570
 stuck to the train elsewhere there is the rock 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.400
 who was behind who propelled me into 

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:19.130
 the air 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:22.010
 so that's it's downright similar 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.620
 as we can see bug from the 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.450
 swing at the gate bug in a gta 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.040
 5 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.850
 So it's just as fun all that 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.040
 it's great fun but I think everything 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:37.040
 just as it is surely less obvious 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.270
 to do that the portal bug so I 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.680
 can not really be sure that this 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.950
 that I 'm not going I did not retry 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:45.620
 this is the only time I do them but 

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:47.480
 seeing that there is coordination between the train 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.660
 and the rock maybe with a 

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:52.700
 car a little too small it does not pass 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.260
 already and then with the heavyweights finally 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.700
 I do not know you're talking about trying 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:57.950
 already you can success it works to 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.630
 dock first it's already that but here 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.669
 in my opinion it's still a little 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:02.960
 less obvious in any case I'm going 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.190
 stop there I hope this video 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.479
 you will be pleased if you are 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.250

 thank you to them if they plant me I can I

 I do not know that but 

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:21.140
