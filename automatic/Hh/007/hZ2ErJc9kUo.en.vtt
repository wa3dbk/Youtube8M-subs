00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:20.640
 who is hildegard kemna initial was it 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.420
 so you the postler the producer 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.310
 and I suspected that was a huge one 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
 potential in this life story of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.360
 hildegard knef is there was that yet 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.000
 not such things formulate something for us 

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:36.180
 the in color we knew that was one 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.510
 controversial wife his wife over 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 actually decades since then 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.800
 post-war Germany our nation 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.450
 has accompanied and the people in riot 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.180
 and at the same time 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.350
 let the hearts beat faster 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.060
 that you are a great artist that you 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.550
 it is designed that she was the sinner 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.160
 that she later becomes an eccentric lady 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 It just did not stop 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.190
 talk 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.060
 we are so old yes and they were 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.060
 things that us 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.920
 I want why you want actress 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.010
 because I am known 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.510
 do you want to know that i know you see 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.710
 I agree Hildegard Knef was for me 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.910
 actually only times relative 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.000
 blank page 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.440
 heard of course and has a few songs 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
 belongs to the pants and so on and so on 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.680
 on 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.840
 but basically she had with mine 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.850
 First of all, do not live that much 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.800
 I am interested in other things 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:34.680
 for other museums and books on everyone 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.570
 case and that was me kind of parents 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.660
 culture with no touch points 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:43.450
 had and then I have to send gifts 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.250
 have been and I already have 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.220
 before some historical films too 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.710
 made and I was so fascinated by 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.420
 her description of her 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.520
 subjective description of 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.250
 German contemporary history and this 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.930
 turbulent life what she has led there 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:00.610
 that I first thought it a story 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.560
 which absolutely must be told so 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:03.850
 for my generation for younger ones 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.550
 people maybe for the 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.550
 people they have experienced 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:15.330
 do not think anything 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:19.040
 she has not actresses convincing the 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.040
 not already not a nothing 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:30.620
 for the future I want with you evening 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.909
 will die with the 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.950
 especially in the war situation as well as in the 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:37.140
 postwar Germany continues in the 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:43.019
 Interpretation of the young hilde 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.019
 bit freer I told myself that 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.599
 they certainly only become mature 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.329
 media experienced lady has developed 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:54.209
 which we later edge off talk shows 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.989
 and so on and was certainly before 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:00.480
 a girl who has similar systems 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.510
 but had in his habitus and gestus 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:05.310
 girl certainly more naturally 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.889
 has met their time as one 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.599
 a star who was very late but 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:14.370
 otherwise there is an awful lot 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:17.940
 material the hildegard knef us 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:24.000
 has left several books films 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:25.230
 talk show appearing records and such 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.970
 You can never guess happy 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:30.299
 researched for a film 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:33.510
 I think Hildegard Knef was one sooner 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.579
 Self-contained woman in big 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:36.959
 conscientiousness had heard that 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:41.699
 Wanted to be seen 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:44.639
 wanted to be loved and not to 

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:45.750
 the brakes keep on going 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:46.799
 she was passionate 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.870
 Passed through life passionately 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:52.370
 it burned for things to avert it 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.510
 had to live your authenticity 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:56.800
 she could not start it 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.720
 could not easy 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.239
 I wanted to tell you that 's great 

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.610
 even if you can not do it if you are the one 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:10.640
 Be the biggest star ever for this country 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:12.860
 has seen only a mirror know de 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:14.239
 Gaul also read the 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.120
 he also wrote a book 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:20.169
 that does not translate to English so 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.970
 it was a bit difficult to read 

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:25.960
 and i have a lot with kant and heike 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:31.010
 spoken and we have a few of these 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:34.040
 the idea is of camel and hilde too 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:41.360
 Home seen that was nice too 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:42.620
 interesting and helpful about her 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.510
 to learn life 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.460
 at this time this postwar period in 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:49.610
 Germany incredibly interesting 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.770
 fascinating and turbulent and also for 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.630
 hilder so it is parallel 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:00.800
 between germany and hildegard knef 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:05:02.780
 the so so so interesting that I so 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.669
 I think that's interesting if you look at it 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.590
 that can say so roughly is divided 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.289
 you live in two parts the first part 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:13.729
 is, so to speak, the part where you are 

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:16.419
 Grow up where your expression is 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:19.700
 Finds where your creativity is 

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:21.500
 certain form finds where you are on very much 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:24.800
 Strong is looking up on the 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:27.680
 a permanent traveling and at the end there 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:32.510
 only as a symbol, finally, the concert 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:35.479
 go to the philharmonic with love 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:36.770
 to the camping and with their writing 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:39.169
 and sing 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.090
 really here together and there comes 

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.879
 a power from her house and one 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:51.050
 Joy of life and an energy the beautiful 

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:52.970
 leaving her there and would too 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:56.750
 do not want to pretend to see it like that 

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:59.569
 But I think what they achieve 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:03.650
 it was possible to achieve that with the singing 

00:05:59.569 --> 00:06:05.300
 and the recordings and I never know 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:09.740
 before exactly what comes out of it and 

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:12.159
 it was not until now but I am 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.159
 satisfied
