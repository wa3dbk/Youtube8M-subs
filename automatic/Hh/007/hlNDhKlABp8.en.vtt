 let's put chicken and raw sugar I 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.290
 I prefer because the curriculum 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.870
 the version that I consider healthy to be 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.420
 there I do not like much flavor of the state 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.670
 it changes the taste of things a bit 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.480
 so I'd rather use the demerara sugar 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.330
 that is much more nutritious is organic 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.980
