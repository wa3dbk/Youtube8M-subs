00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
max you've set but you're going to be

limited by your buffer size which is

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:44.350 
limited by your buffer size which is
dependent<00:02:42.769> upon<00:02:42.860> what<00:02:43.310> file<00:02:43.819> format<00:02:43.940> you're

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:44.360

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:45.600 
dependent upon what file format you're
shooting<00:02:44.630> so<00:02:44.750> if<00:02:44.810> you're<00:02:44.900> shooting<00:02:45.019> raw

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.530 
shooting so if you're shooting raw
actually<00:02:46.610> here's<00:02:46.760> another<00:02:47.030> little<00:02:47.209> tip<00:02:47.420> if

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
actually here's another little tip if

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually here's another little tip if
you<00:02:47.630> push<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.170> shutter<00:02:48.319> release<00:02:48.470> down

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
you push the shutter release down

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.360 
you push the shutter release down
halfway<00:02:49.700> you<00:02:50.450> can<00:02:50.569> see<00:02:50.780> an<00:02:50.900> R<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.709> number<00:02:52.130> in

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
halfway you can see an R and a number in

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.630 
halfway you can see an R and a number in
the<00:02:52.900> top<00:02:53.900> LCD<00:02:54.380> here<00:02:54.590> and<00:02:55.160> that<00:02:55.280> tells<00:02:55.459> you<00:02:55.549> how

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
the top LCD here and that tells you how

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.880 
the top LCD here and that tells you how
many<00:02:55.700> images<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.360> have<00:02:56.510> left<00:02:56.720> on<00:02:56.930> your<00:02:56.959> buffer

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
many images you have left on your buffer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:01.449 
many images you have left on your buffer
before<00:02:58.610> it<00:02:58.910> has<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.180> stop<00:02:59.540> to<00:03:00.350> down<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.799> write

00:03:01.449 --> 00:03:01.459 
before it has to stop to down to write

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:02.500 
before it has to stop to down to write
the<00:03:01.610> images<00:03:01.880> to<00:03:02.000> your<00:03:02.120> card

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
the images to your card

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.690 
the images to your card
great<00:03:03.049> point<00:03:03.350> and<00:03:03.530> that's<00:03:03.680> true<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.370> you<00:03:04.400> can

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
great point and that's true so you can

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.520 
great point and that's true so you can
shoot<00:03:04.940> up<00:03:05.150> to<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.330> sequence<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.080> hundred

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
shoot up to a sequence of a hundred

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.949 
shoot up to a sequence of a hundred
shots<00:03:06.769> with<00:03:07.130> this<00:03:07.280> camera<00:03:07.670> now<00:03:08.360> that's<00:03:08.720> really

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
shots with this camera now that's really

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:11.020 
shots with this camera now that's really
dependent<00:03:09.709> on<00:03:09.799> the<00:03:09.860> quality<00:03:10.310> setting<00:03:10.940> that

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 
dependent on the quality setting that

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.390 
dependent on the quality setting that
you're<00:03:11.180> in<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.630> RAW<00:03:12.049> for<00:03:12.380> example<00:03:12.920> you've

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
you're in in RAW for example you've

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.000 
you're in in RAW for example you've
actually<00:03:13.610> got<00:03:13.910> a<00:03:13.940> buffer<00:03:14.450> limit<00:03:14.780> of<00:03:14.900> 17<00:03:15.530> frames

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
actually got a buffer limit of 17 frames

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.970 
actually got a buffer limit of 17 frames
so<00:03:16.670> you<00:03:16.760> can<00:03:16.970> shoot<00:03:17.120> 17<00:03:17.750> frames<00:03:18.170> before<00:03:18.829> the

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
so you can shoot 17 frames before the

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.949 
so you can shoot 17 frames before the
camera<00:03:19.310> actually<00:03:19.459> has<00:03:19.880> to<00:03:20.090> stop<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.750> pause

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
camera actually has to stop and pause

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.170 
camera actually has to stop and pause
for<00:03:21.019> a<00:03:21.320> minute<00:03:21.440> to<00:03:21.620> catch<00:03:21.920> up<00:03:22.180> processing

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
for a minute to catch up processing

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.750 
for a minute to catch up processing
those<00:03:23.359> images<00:03:23.900> they<00:03:24.049> call<00:03:24.290> it<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.560> buffer<00:03:25.100> if

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
those images they call it a buffer if

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.090 
those images they call it a buffer if
you're<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.090> lower<00:03:26.359> resolution<00:03:27.200> images<00:03:27.920> like

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
you're in lower resolution images like

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.520 
you're in lower resolution images like
jpg<00:03:28.579> for<00:03:28.790> example<00:03:29.180> again<00:03:29.630> you<00:03:29.750> can<00:03:30.019> shoot<00:03:30.350> up

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:30.530 
jpg for example again you can shoot up

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:32.650

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
they have now just written over that

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.469 
they have now just written over that
first<00:04:30.229> card<00:04:30.710> or<00:04:30.889> that<00:04:31.099> first<00:04:31.370> set<00:04:31.729> of<00:04:31.969> numbers

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
files with the next set so for safety

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:37.929

I<00:04:37.969> keep<00:04:38.509> file<00:04:39.020> number<00:04:39.379> sequence<00:04:39.830> on<00:04:40.039> that<00:04:40.759> way

00:04:41.019 --> 00:04:41.029 
I keep file number sequence on that way

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:42.519 
I keep file number sequence on that way
when<00:04:41.360> I<00:04:41.389> take<00:04:41.689> the<00:04:41.870> card<00:04:42.139> out<00:04:42.319> of<00:04:42.349> the<00:04:42.439> camera

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:42.529 
when I take the card out of the camera

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:46.390 
when I take the card out of the camera
if<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.159> last<00:04:43.400> number<00:04:43.729> was<00:04:44.169> 275<00:04:45.169> the<00:04:46.009> next

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
if the last number was 275 the next

if the last number was 275 the next
number<00:04:46.729> on<00:04:46.909> the<00:04:47.150> new<00:04:47.300> card<00:04:47.599> is<00:04:47.719> going<00:04:47.810> to<00:04:47.870> be

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
number on the new card is going to be

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:50.890 
number on the new card is going to be
276<00:04:49.039> it's<00:04:49.610> also<00:04:49.729> a<00:04:49.909> great<00:04:50.180> way<00:04:50.330> for<00:04:50.360> just<00:04:50.719> if

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
