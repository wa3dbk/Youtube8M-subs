00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.749
 hello how about youtube friends in this 

00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:07.850
 small tutorial I will teach you how to 

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:10.880
 know what processor we have in our 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.680
 computer our computer to know of 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:16.020
 how much of our processors and is it 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.750
 32 bits or 64 bits 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.670
 I will make a small clarification to 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.670
 through social networks I've seen 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.870
 that teach how to see which processor 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.910
 we have 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.940
 I have not really seen him say 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:34.270
 how much is our processor to is a 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.030
 way a little I feel that does not tell you 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.930
 really how much is the processor like that 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.870
 that's why I will take the freedom of 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:48.920
 make this video and make that clarification 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.710
 so I'm going to show you how it is that I 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.980
 I've seen those videos that are and for 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.860
 that we're going to go to start at start 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.979
 to go to computer equipment we will give it 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.750
 right click let's go to properties and 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.309
 in properties we see this 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.890
 rectangle 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.560
 and actually here it says processor 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.689
 teacher who tells us that we have a 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:17.360
 inter but does not tell us how much is 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:20.080
 our processor if it is 32 or 64 bits 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.690
 sometimes they tell you that the 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:25.610
 64-bit processors but in this 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.780
 part what I look at that says this 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.790
 64 is the type of system that has to 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:35.360
 We have our machine our 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:37.770
 computer and it's not the processor is the 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.250
 professor appears here in the part 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.200
 above but it does not tell us how much it is 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.730
 so to see how much is our 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 processor let's close this part 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:52.979
 we close this and we're going to start 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.010
 in the beginning we will go to our team 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.860
 we are going to click on it and there 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.320
 let's go to disk and there you will 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.470
 click here let's go where it says 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:08.610
 windows windows we give you click 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:12.810
 to search our register our raid 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.319
 of network that is called by its letters in 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.599
 English we are going to look for it here 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.969
 here we find him we are going to give him two 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.469
 It gave peaks that appears click and then 

00:02:19.969 --> 00:02:23.469
 will ask us for permission to do 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.939
 the program of some changes in 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:31.030
 our computer we are going to tell you that 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.720
 if sometimes you need to be 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.770
 as administrator to be able 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.170
 is this part or otherwise not 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.670
 will allow you to enter this part the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.490
 desertification should be like 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.030
 administrator I will close everything here 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.650
 to show them again 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.439
 and I had it open 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.750
 ok here we are going to open and here we are going 

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:56.650
 where the crazy machines says we're going to 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.599
 open this little eyelash 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.780
 here we are going to go to who says hardware 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.579
 open the little eye will open to 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.340
 who gives us more options we will go 

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:09.489
 it says description or description we are going to 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.250
 open it here we go where you say we are 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:14.709
 systems we open it and here we're going to go to 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.769
 ies sancho tests I hope processor 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:20.829
 central we open it and here we are going to go 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:24.370
 here where it says 0 and this is where 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:27.299
 tells us what processor we have 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.709
 here we can know where identifier says 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:33.370
 identifier says that we have a 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:36.490
 bloated 64 bit and that's actually 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.070
 the processor that we have 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.470
 there is another way to see to do more 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:45.580
 short this not so long process is the 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.130
 I'm going to show in case for some reason 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.980
 can you reach this step or would you like 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:53.140
 see it in another shorter way I'm going 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:56.560
 to show the other way comes what 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.600
 same but without doing so much we're going to 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.510
 close all this let's go here where 

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:03.940
 says home what can we write here 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:08.770
 let's see script network 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.960
 r2 and your little rectangle of 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.120
 search in this part or if you do not have it 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.860
 as in this case so that you get what 

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:17.389
 what you have to do is press 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.969
 windows 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.299
 and this little magical will appear to you 

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:24.539
 screen 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:26.360
 and here we are going to give you network network as well 

00:04:24.539 --> 00:04:29.620
 listening 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.620
 sorry r 

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:35.870
 in the city 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:38.690
 well ok network claims and ask us for permission 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:42.249
 we say yes and enter again 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.439
 here we are going to do a process 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:47.109
 here on the tab where it says what if 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.299
 we do not give it to us, we will leave 

00:04:47.109 --> 00:04:51.369
 word the same let's go the description 

00:04:49.299 --> 00:04:54.339
 description the same thing we're going to go to 

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:57.729
 systems we do the same function be 

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:59.769
 tests a central processor we do the 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:02.619
 same function and we go where the zero is 

00:04:59.769 --> 00:05:06.790
 there we give it and here is our 

00:05:02.619 --> 00:05:08.950
 564 identifier 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.520
 I'm going to open the other screen to 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:14.110
 show them the difference or maybe something 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.450
 what 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:19.570
 I can show you what it shows us 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:21.660
 the other part we will go to start with 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:26.230
 Peter let's give a right click 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:29.340
 properties and here we have the other part 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.960
 as you can see here where it says 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:35.920
 processor does not teach us what is not 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:38.830
 here identifier teaches us that the 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.810
 processor we have how much what we 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.650
 is showing who says processor 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.760
 it says internal trim m here what 

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:49.920
 we can see says teacher name 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:54.330
 the name of the processor that we have 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:56.910
 here you can see it bloated clipping mi5 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.280
 it is the same information that appears 

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:02.370
 here index the processor is actually 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:04.950
 the name of the processor and where it says 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:08.130
 identifier or identifier tells us of 

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.770
 how much is our processor so in 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:12.900
 reality in this part is not us 

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.850
 teaching how much it is and gives us the 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:17.460
 name of the processor but it does not tell us 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.400
 how much is our processor in the 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:23.430
 part here below does not say the kind of 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.460
 system that we have that is 64 bits 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:28.980
 but as I was explaining we are 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:32.380
 looking for how much is our processor 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:35.290
 new our operating system 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.360
 and that is the correct way to find 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:39.550
 or look for our processor to our 

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:41.410
 team 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:43.600
 or maybe there must be other ways 

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:46.510
 of how to look for your processor maybe I 

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:49.270
 I do not know but if someone has something else 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:53.390
 better idea please leave your comment 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:57.080
 your video let me know 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:07:00.480
 and please do not forget to subscribe to 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:02.910
 this channel for more videos 

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.530
 leave your comment that you would like 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.530
 what topic would you like us to treat 

00:07:06.870 --> 00:07:10.850
 thanks for everything and until next time
