00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
with Mathematica I know that it's an

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.650 
with Mathematica I know that it's an

a good day tell us about what
Mathematica<00:00:31.080> really<00:00:31.260> does<00:00:31.439> well<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.219> I<00:00:32.369> mean

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
Mathematica really does well so I mean

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
second a periodic table table back up

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.640 
second a periodic table table back up
again<00:01:05.309> that<00:01:05.729> was<00:01:05.820> cool<00:01:06.090> yes<00:01:06.750> well<00:01:06.990> right<00:01:07.200> like

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
again that was cool yes well right like

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.899 
again that was cool yes well right like
I<00:01:07.740> said<00:01:07.920> normally<00:01:08.070> I'd<00:01:08.369> be<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.610> telling<00:01:08.790> you

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I said normally I'd be here telling you

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:09.890 
I said normally I'd be here telling you
about<00:01:08.970> Mathematica<00:01:09.540> but<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.780> has

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
about Mathematica but that has

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.230 
about Mathematica but that has
absolutely<00:01:10.080> nothing<00:01:10.530> to<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.890> with<00:01:11.090> why<00:01:12.090> I'm

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
absolutely nothing to do with why I'm

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.730 
absolutely nothing to do with why I'm
here<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.080> real<00:01:13.290> hobby<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.619> mine

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
here this this is a real hobby of mine

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.990 
here this this is a real hobby of mine
that<00:01:13.860> I<00:01:13.950> got<00:01:14.130> started<00:01:14.310> with<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> couple<00:01:14.820> years

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
that I got started with a couple years

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.060 
that I got started with a couple years
ago<00:01:15.119> when<00:01:15.810> we<00:01:15.840> need<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.110> conference<00:01:16.470> table<00:01:16.680> for

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
ago when we need a conference table for

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.660 
ago when we need a conference table for
my<00:01:17.159> office<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:17.670> I<00:01:17.759> thought<00:01:17.939> well<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.390> know

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
my office and I thought well you know

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.100 
my office and I thought well you know
the<00:01:20.670> periodic<00:01:21.030> table<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.750> know<00:01:21.900> we<00:01:22.049> need

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
the periodic table and you know we need

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.770 
the periodic table and you know we need
a<00:01:22.170> table<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.590> we'll<00:01:22.770> make<00:01:22.920> table<00:01:23.390> and<00:01:24.390> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
a table so we'll make table and that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.789 
a table so we'll make table and that
kind<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.049> you<00:01:25.229> know<00:01:25.320> one<00:01:25.470> thing<00:01:25.619> led<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
kind of you know one thing led to

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:26.960 
kind of you know one thing led to
another<00:01:25.920> and<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.280> ended<00:01:26.460> up<00:01:26.549> writing<00:01:26.790> this

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
another and I ended up writing this

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.340 
another and I ended up writing this
column<00:01:27.390> for<00:01:27.509> popular<00:01:27.869> science<00:01:28.049> which<00:01:28.320> is

column for popular science which is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.770 
column for popular science which is
about<00:01:28.680> sort<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.280> mature<00:01:29.970> science<00:01:30.210> kinds<00:01:30.689> of

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
about sort of a mature science kinds of

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:39.920 
chemist arse that's enough for one let

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.410 
chemist arse that's enough for one let
me<00:03:39.950> chop<00:03:40.160> it<00:03:40.280> up<00:03:40.340> a<00:03:40.459> little<00:03:40.580> here<00:03:40.790> we<00:03:41.330> don't

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
me chop it up a little here we don't

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.850 
me chop it up a little here we don't
want<00:03:41.600> to<00:03:41.660> form<00:03:41.840> a<00:03:41.900> crust<00:03:42.110> here<00:03:42.380> that's<00:03:42.590> bad

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
want to form a crust here that's bad

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.310 
want to form a crust here that's bad
okay<00:03:43.340> no<00:03:43.700> crust

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
okay no crust

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.900 
okay no crust
you<00:03:46.320> want<00:03:46.530> to<00:03:46.590> keep<00:03:46.740> this<00:03:46.950> nice<00:03:47.220> and<00:03:47.430> stirred

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
you want to keep this nice and stirred

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:50.090 
you want to keep this nice and stirred
up<00:03:48.200> gloves<00:03:49.200> are<00:03:49.350> bad<00:03:49.470> yet<00:03:49.680> because<00:03:49.830> liquid

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
up gloves are bad yet because liquid

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.310 
up gloves are bad yet because liquid
nitrogen<00:03:50.370> actually<00:03:50.640> will<00:03:51.210> not<00:03:51.360> hurt<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:51.840> if

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
nitrogen actually will not hurt you if

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.960 
nitrogen actually will not hurt you if
you<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.890> kind<00:03:53.130> of<00:03:53.160> pour<00:03:53.400> it<00:03:53.520> over<00:03:53.610> your<00:03:53.940> skin

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
you just kind of pour it over your skin

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.730 
you just kind of pour it over your skin
or<00:03:54.330> whatever<00:03:54.540> splashes<00:03:55.020> on<00:03:55.170> you<00:03:55.350> so<00:03:55.650> we

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:55.740 
or whatever splashes on you so we

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.870 
or whatever splashes on you so we

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
actually I can actually reach in here

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.250 
actually I can actually reach in here
and<00:03:57.030> touch<00:03:57.150> the<00:03:57.300> look<00:03:57.420> like<00:03:57.660> that's<00:03:58.020> them<00:03:58.140> in

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
and touch the look like that's them in

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.450 
and touch the look like that's them in
there<00:03:58.380> you<00:03:58.410> could<00:03:58.680> there<00:03:58.860> there<00:03:59.070> are<00:03:59.160> no<00:03:59.280> it's

00:03:59.450 --> 00:03:59.460 
there you could there there are no it's

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
there you could there there are no it's
in<00:03:59.610> there<00:03:59.760> I<00:03:59.790> can<00:04:00.030> see<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:00.300> flashing<00:04:05.330> for<00:04:06.330> too

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
in there I can see it's flashing for too

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.300 
in there I can see it's flashing for too
long<00:04:06.630> so<00:04:06.690> don't<00:04:07.140> don't<00:04:07.500> sit<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> in<00:04:08.100> there<00:04:08.280> for

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
long so don't don't sit it in there for

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:11.180 
long so don't don't sit it in there for
oh<00:04:08.550> yeah<00:04:09.200> for<00:04:10.200> example<00:04:10.650> if<00:04:10.830> you're<00:04:10.980> wearing

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
oh yeah for example if you're wearing

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:12.920 
oh yeah for example if you're wearing
gloves<00:04:11.280> and<00:04:11.580> some<00:04:11.820> splashes<00:04:12.150> down<00:04:12.540> behind<00:04:12.720> the

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
gloves and some splashes down behind the

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.030 
gloves and some splashes down behind the
cuffs<00:04:13.140> or<00:04:13.290> whatever<00:04:13.500> gets<00:04:13.710> down<00:04:13.860> in<00:04:13.980> the

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
cuffs or whatever gets down in the

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.570 
cuffs or whatever gets down in the
fingers<00:04:14.400> that's<00:04:14.970> bad<00:04:15.210> that's<00:04:16.200> why<00:04:16.890> yeah<00:04:17.310> keep

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:17.580 
fingers that's bad that's why yeah keep

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.190 
fingers that's bad that's why yeah keep
going<00:04:17.609> as<00:04:18.090> you<00:04:18.180> put<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.450> up<00:04:18.540> buy<00:04:18.690> Shipman's<00:04:18.959> are

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
going as you put it up buy Shipman's are

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.259 
going as you put it up buy Shipman's are
definitely<00:04:19.650> bad<00:04:19.859> right<00:04:20.730> because<00:04:21.030> they<00:04:21.120> can

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
definitely bad right because they can

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:23.720 
definitely bad right because they can
actually<00:04:21.680> catch<00:04:22.680> the<00:04:22.710> liquid<00:04:23.250> nitrogen<00:04:23.520> in

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
actually catch the liquid nitrogen in

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.340 
actually catch the liquid nitrogen in

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750 
level - the liquid nitrogen this is

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:40.490 
level - the liquid nitrogen this is
amazing

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:40.500 
amazing

might wonder well how do we know that
this<00:05:16.650> is<00:05:16.830> not<00:05:17.010> going<00:05:17.220> to<00:05:17.280> just<00:05:17.370> freeze<00:05:17.640> your

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820

throat<00:05:18.000> the<00:05:18.330> answer<00:05:18.600> is<00:05:18.690> that<00:05:18.870> with<00:05:19.440> straight

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
throat the answer is that with straight

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.830 
throat the answer is that with straight
cream<00:05:20.010> like<00:05:20.190> this<00:05:20.220> if<00:05:20.640> it<00:05:21.120> were<00:05:21.240> too<00:05:21.419> cold<00:05:21.690> to

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:21.840 
cream like this if it were too cold to

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:23.240 
cream like this if it were too cold to
eat<00:05:21.960> it<00:05:22.229> would<00:05:22.350> be<00:05:22.440> too<00:05:22.590> cold<00:05:22.860> to<00:05:23.010> serve

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
eat it would be too cold to serve

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.310 
eat it would be too cold to serve
through<00:05:24.060> those<00:05:24.210> we'd<00:05:24.419> have<00:05:24.510> a<00:05:24.540> brick<00:05:24.870> yeah

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.320 
through those we'd have a brick yeah

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.600 
through those we'd have a brick yeah
you'd<00:05:25.500> have<00:05:25.530> a<00:05:25.650> brick<00:05:25.890> and<00:05:26.130> that's<00:05:26.370> why<00:05:26.550> you

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
you'd have a brick and that's why you

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.010 
you'd have a brick and that's why you
don't<00:05:26.850> want<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.120> use<00:05:27.240> alcohol<00:05:27.450> in<00:05:27.900> this

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:28.020 
don't want to use alcohol in this

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:29.600 
don't want to use alcohol in this
mixture<00:05:28.350> as<00:05:28.590> he<00:05:28.950> was<00:05:29.070> just<00:05:29.220> saying<00:05:29.430> because

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
mixture as he was just saying because

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.370 
mixture as he was just saying because
that'll<00:05:30.390> depress<00:05:30.660> the<00:05:30.780> freezing<00:05:31.110> point<00:05:31.229> you

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:31.380 
that'll depress the freezing point you

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.900 
that'll depress the freezing point you
actually<00:05:31.530> can<00:05:31.890> if<00:05:32.070> you<00:05:32.190> put<00:05:32.370> too<00:05:32.550> much<00:05:32.580> alcohol

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:32.910 
actually can if you put too much alcohol

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:34.969 
actually can if you put too much alcohol
and<00:05:33.390> end<00:05:33.600> up<00:05:34.140> with<00:05:34.290> something<00:05:34.620> that's<00:05:34.800> smooth

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
and end up with something that's smooth
