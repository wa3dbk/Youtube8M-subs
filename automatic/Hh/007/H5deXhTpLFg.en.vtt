00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.420
 with the production of criminal point walter 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.120

 situation of banker and about his 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.530
 aggression to banker and will do 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.230
 been in my house was to bathe me 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.530
 when the technician very worried because 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:54.300
 several call me what I can was 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.980
 a sling a sling not a prickly pear I 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.600
 I ask you if you want to make a 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:59.250
 clarification on the aggression to banchero 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.789
 and why he assaulted him that I think 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:05.129
 deplorable do you can not comment 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:07.259
 I was not I just say that 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.149
 he was taking a bath, so either 

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:10.619
 you can say if they were given a 

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:16.229
 prickly pear that ends up saying I was 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:17.759
 bathing when you think no, you told me 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.200
 I was taking a bath when I called the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.740
 neighborhood chifle I feel like I went for the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.240
 court 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.570
 and it says it was a center wave if you 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.820
 is reviewing something that did not see or not 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.820
 there was no banker with a bruise 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.490
 he left you know why they were fair 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.770
 do it 0 I say you have to have 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.350
 beware that bonus holds for me 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.899
 tell me that I have to put and the pse does not 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 currents that I was not insulting anyone I 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.690
 pushed then there we grabbed onto 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.450
 pummeled because even any 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.250
 it was in the food the leather tells me 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.170
 I do not care about food stuff 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.860
 the truth that everything you can 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.010
 say when 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.960
 Assaulting a fist on someone is not 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.180
 credible if you are telling the truth 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.100
 because he thinks so or is not assaulted 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:11.160
 something that we are all against 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:17.120
 then from that you would 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:20.130
 they hit a pardon they hit him they pushed and 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.780
 they pushed him and you immediately 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.810
 he responded with fist punches be 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.880
 Banchero pushed it according to you 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.790
 with a microphone they do what they want 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.739
 they say what they want to handle very sad 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.510
 mind what then I tell you that 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:37.350
 you have money and do what you want 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.220
 with silver 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.270
 in cerrito or no no no and it's not like that either 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.250
 that we do what we want with the 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.989
 microphone knows one thing I think it does not give 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.280
 for more I thank you that you have had 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.500
 enough right to reply 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 you audio ife is a repeat offender in this 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.700
 not because he had seized troops with 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.150
 July rivers on the riverbank because he is a 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.150
 heater 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.190
 punching the balls 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.510
 I like to say goodbye until later 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.400
 thanks for everything has been walter 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.910
 audifred giving his version here on point 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.590
 penal 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.420
 in this way exacerbated violence that 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.420
 exists in the Uruguayan Indian
