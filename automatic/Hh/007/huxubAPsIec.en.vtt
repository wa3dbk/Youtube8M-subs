00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
numbers so we're going to use wildcards

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.630 
numbers so we're going to use wildcards
and<00:01:01.469> I'm<00:01:01.559> going<00:01:01.680> to<00:01:01.739> put<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.219> double

and then for wildcard two wildcard 3 now

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.330 
and then for wildcard two wildcard 3 now
what<00:01:13.409> these<00:01:13.820> wildcards<00:01:14.820> stand<00:01:15.299> for<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.900> 0<00:01:16.710> or

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
what these wildcards stand for is 0 or

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.850 
what these wildcards stand for is 0 or
more<00:01:18.270> characters<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.170> right<00:01:19.409> now

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
more characters so right now

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.830 
more characters so right now
you<00:01:20.130> could<00:01:20.250> be<00:01:20.310> looking<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.610> 4<00:01:21.030> and<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.720> would

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you could be looking for 4 and it would

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.060 
you could be looking for 4 and it would
see<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.110> there's<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.380> foreign<00:01:22.710> nothing

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
see that there's a foreign nothing

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.149 
see that there's a foreign nothing
before<00:01:23.460> if<00:01:23.580> there<00:01:23.759> was<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> 4<00:01:24.210> in<00:01:24.330> the<00:01:24.420> middle

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
before if there was a 4 in the middle

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.950 
before if there was a 4 in the middle
there<00:01:26.159> could<00:01:26.340> be<00:01:26.369> some<00:01:26.610> characters<00:01:27.509> before<00:01:27.689> it

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
there could be some characters before it

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.440 
there could be some characters before it
and<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.229> would<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.500> perfectly<00:01:29.159> alright<00:01:29.490> so

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
and it would be perfectly alright so

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.260 
and it would be perfectly alright so
this<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:31.049> mixing<00:01:31.829> our<00:01:31.979> criteria<00:01:32.729> here<00:01:33.090> with

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
this is mixing our criteria here with

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.140 
this is mixing our criteria here with
these<00:01:33.479> wild<00:01:34.229> cards<00:01:34.979> right<00:01:35.400> so<00:01:35.549> for<00:01:35.670> example<00:01:36.030> on

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
these wild cards right so for example on

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.929 
these wild cards right so for example on
3<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.810> could<00:01:37.439> find<00:01:37.680> a<00:01:37.829> 3<00:01:38.130> at<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.369> end<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.850> then

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
3 it could find a 3 at the end and then

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.490 
3 it could find a 3 at the end and then
this<00:01:39.060> would<00:01:39.270> be<00:01:39.420> no<00:01:39.630> characters<00:01:40.110> after<00:01:40.380> or

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
this would be no characters after or

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.590 
this would be no characters after or
could<00:01:40.710> find<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:41.009> 3<00:01:41.340> right<00:01:41.579> there

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
could find a 3 right there

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.469 
could find a 3 right there
and<00:01:42.689> there<00:01:43.049> would<00:01:43.170> be<00:01:43.200> two<00:01:43.790> digits<00:01:44.790> after<00:01:45.299> that

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
and there would be two digits after that

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.590 
and there would be two digits after that
so<00:01:46.170> that's<00:01:46.380> our<00:01:46.939> what<00:01:47.939> we're<00:01:48.090> trying<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.360> find

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
so that's our what we're trying to find

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.889 
so that's our what we're trying to find
comma<00:01:49.020> within<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.570> we're<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
comma within this and we're going to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
comma within this and we're going to
close<00:01:52.110> parentheses<00:01:52.770> and<00:01:52.939> double<00:01:53.939> click<00:01:54.090> and

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
close parentheses and double click and

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.670 
close parentheses and double click and
send<00:01:54.299> it<00:01:54.509> all<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> way<00:01:54.869> down<00:01:55.020> now<00:01:55.200> if<00:01:55.350> I<00:01:55.439> come

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
send it all the way down now if I come

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.149 
send it all the way down now if I come
here<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.009> I<00:01:56.100> type<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.729> 2<00:01:57.270> 3<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.799> see<00:01:58.829> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
here and I type a 2 3 you can see and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:00.590 
here and I type a 2 3 you can see and
it's<00:01:59.310> always<00:01:59.490> going<00:01:59.759> to<00:01:59.790> give<00:01:59.939> us<00:02:00.030> 1<00:02:00.270> because

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it's always going to give us 1 because

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.050 
it's always going to give us 1 because
of<00:02:00.689> the<00:02:00.750> wildcards<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.860> right<00:02:02.070> here<00:02:02.549> let's

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of the wildcards but right here let's

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.499 
of the wildcards but right here let's
say<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.299> 2<00:02:03.689> 3<00:02:04.079> here<00:02:04.790> or<00:02:05.790> uh

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.459 

that<00:02:10.509> one's<00:02:10.689> not<00:02:10.840> going<00:02:10.959> to<00:02:11.019> find<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:11.319> because

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:11.469 
that one's not going to find it because

00:02:11.469 --> 00:02:15.080 
that one's not going to find it because
it's<00:02:11.590> not<00:02:11.739> in<00:02:11.980> order<00:02:12.340> but<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:12.879> one<00:02:13.469> would

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
it's not in order but this one would

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.300 
it's not in order but this one would
alright<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.299> I'm<00:02:17.200> going<00:02:17.409> to<00:02:17.469> undo<00:02:17.859> that<00:02:17.890> keep

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
alright and I'm going to undo that keep

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.819 
alright and I'm going to undo that keep
this<00:02:18.519> integrity<00:02:18.969> of<00:02:19.329> this<00:02:19.510> set<00:02:19.750> here<00:02:19.959> that's

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:20.829 
this integrity of this set here that's

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:22.530 
this integrity of this set here that's
fine<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:21.640> you<00:02:21.730> can<00:02:21.790> come<00:02:22.030> down<00:02:22.180> here<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.390> see

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
fine and you can come down here and see

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.000 
fine and you can come down here and see
there's<00:02:22.719> a<00:02:22.810> first<00:02:23.079> one<00:02:23.230> four<00:02:23.500> zero<00:02:23.709> zero<00:02:23.739> two

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
there's a first one four zero zero two

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.770 
there's a first one four zero zero two
three<00:02:24.219> but<00:02:24.340> what<00:02:24.519> we<00:02:24.670> really<00:02:24.970> want<00:02:25.000> is<00:02:25.269> it<00:02:25.420> true

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
three but what we really want is it true

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.330 
three but what we really want is it true
and<00:02:26.049> the<00:02:26.290> reason<00:02:26.530> why<00:02:26.650> is<00:02:26.709> maybe<00:02:26.980> you<00:02:27.099> want<00:02:27.280> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
and the reason why is maybe you want to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.429 
and the reason why is maybe you want to
filter<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:28.209> extract<00:02:28.659> so<00:02:28.900> I'm<00:02:28.989> simply

00:02:29.429 --> 00:02:29.439 
filter and then extract so I'm simply

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.379 
filter and then extract so I'm simply
going<00:02:29.590> to<00:02:29.709> say<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:31.409> number<00:02:32.700> now<00:02:33.700> really<00:02:34.060> if<00:02:34.239> you

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:34.389 
going to say is number now really if you

00:02:34.389 --> 00:02:36.660 
going to say is number now really if you
were<00:02:34.510> going<00:02:34.659> to<00:02:34.750> sort<00:02:35.260> this<00:02:35.590> you<00:02:36.159> could<00:02:36.370> sort

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
were going to sort this you could sort

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.890 
were going to sort this you could sort
because<00:02:36.790> all<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.120> values<00:02:37.510> would<00:02:37.659> come

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
because all the values would come

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.080 
because all the values would come
together<00:02:38.109> and<00:02:38.769> the<00:02:38.889> number<00:02:39.219> ones<00:02:39.579> would<00:02:39.849> come

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
together and the number ones would come

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.300 
together and the number ones would come
together<00:02:40.209> but<00:02:40.959> if<00:02:41.170> you<00:02:41.379> wanted<00:02:41.709> to<00:02:41.859> keep<00:02:42.099> it

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
together but if you wanted to keep it

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.970 
together but if you wanted to keep it
clean<00:02:42.730> you<00:02:42.970> could<00:02:43.120> do<00:02:43.329> is<00:02:43.560> number<00:02:44.560> you

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
clean you could do is number you

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.679 
clean you could do is number you
absolutely<00:02:45.549> do<00:02:45.700> not<00:02:45.819> have<00:02:46.060> to<00:02:46.209> do<00:02:46.299> this<00:02:46.450> to<00:02:46.599> get

00:02:46.679 --> 00:02:46.689 
absolutely do not have to do this to get

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:48.330 
absolutely do not have to do this to get
that<00:02:46.870> sort<00:02:47.319> to<00:02:47.409> work<00:02:47.680> and<00:02:47.889> then<00:02:47.980> there's<00:02:48.159> our

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that sort to work and then there's our

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.220 
that sort to work and then there's our
first<00:02:48.669> true<00:02:48.939> now<00:02:49.450> what<00:02:49.629> if<00:02:49.750> you<00:02:49.840> wanted<00:02:50.079> to

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
first true now what if you wanted to

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.110 
first true now what if you wanted to
count<00:02:50.530> how<00:02:50.799> many<00:02:50.859> you're<00:02:51.220> like<00:02:51.340> man<00:02:51.639> how<00:02:51.909> many

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
count how many you're like man how many

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460 
count how many you're like man how many
are<00:02:52.299> there<00:02:52.450> well<00:02:52.659> I'm<00:02:52.750> going<00:02:52.870> to<00:02:52.900> copy<00:02:53.169> this

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
are there well I'm going to copy this

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.770 
are there well I'm going to copy this
and<00:02:53.530> come<00:02:53.829> over<00:02:53.950> here<00:02:54.280> and<00:02:54.419> we'll<00:02:55.419> just<00:02:55.599> do<00:02:55.750> a

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
and come over here and we'll just do a

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.629 
and come over here and we'll just do a
little<00:02:56.019> array<00:02:56.590> formula<00:02:57.280> I'm<00:02:57.340> going<00:02:57.489> to<00:02:57.549> use

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
little array formula I'm going to use

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:01.259 
little array formula I'm going to use
some<00:02:57.970> product<00:02:58.709> and<00:02:59.709> I'm<00:03:00.459> going<00:03:00.609> to<00:03:00.639> paste<00:03:00.970> this

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
some product and I'm going to paste this

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.020 
some product and I'm going to paste this
now<00:03:01.870> right<00:03:02.049> now<00:03:02.200> that's<00:03:02.439> just<00:03:02.739> one<00:03:03.099> item<00:03:03.430> but

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
now right now that's just one item but

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.659 
now right now that's just one item but
instead<00:03:04.359> of<00:03:04.510> putting<00:03:04.750> just<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.709> single<00:03:06.099> cell<00:03:06.400> I

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:06.669 
instead of putting just a single cell I

00:03:06.669 --> 00:03:08.879 
instead of putting just a single cell I
can<00:03:06.879> highlight<00:03:07.599> this<00:03:07.810> whole<00:03:07.989> column<00:03:08.409> now<00:03:08.829> I

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:08.889 
can highlight this whole column now I

00:03:08.889 --> 00:03:10.559 
can highlight this whole column now I
have<00:03:09.189> one<00:03:09.430> cell<00:03:09.730> selected<00:03:10.180> I'm<00:03:10.269> going<00:03:10.389> to<00:03:10.450> use

00:03:10.559 --> 00:03:10.569 
have one cell selected I'm going to use

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.520 
have one cell selected I'm going to use
control<00:03:11.079> shift<00:03:11.109> down<00:03:11.530> arrow<00:03:12.030> to<00:03:13.319> send<00:03:14.319> the

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
control shift down arrow to send the

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:15.780 
control shift down arrow to send the
range<00:03:14.799> all<00:03:15.099> the<00:03:15.129> way<00:03:15.220> down<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:15.549> then<00:03:15.669> I'm

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
range all the way down and then I'm

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.670 
range all the way down and then I'm
going<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.940> scroll<00:03:16.389> back<00:03:16.449> up<00:03:16.959> over<00:03:17.139> here

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
going to scroll back up over here

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.339 
going to scroll back up over here
now<00:03:18.489> what<00:03:18.819> this<00:03:19.000> will<00:03:19.209> do<00:03:19.419> is<00:03:19.599> it<00:03:19.750> will<00:03:19.780> return

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:20.349 
now what this will do is it will return

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.140 
now what this will do is it will return
a<00:03:20.709> bunch<00:03:21.370> of<00:03:21.699> value<00:03:22.120> errors<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:22.750> one<00:03:23.620> but<00:03:24.400> it's

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
a bunch of value errors and one but it's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.939 
a bunch of value errors and one but it's
also<00:03:25.389> going<00:03:25.629> to<00:03:25.690> be<00:03:25.810> inside<00:03:26.199> of<00:03:26.260> is<00:03:26.590> a<00:03:26.620> number

00:03:26.939 --> 00:03:26.949 
also going to be inside of is a number

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:29.550 
also going to be inside of is a number
and<00:03:27.129> actually<00:03:27.310> right<00:03:28.120> here<00:03:28.569> I<00:03:28.720> think<00:03:29.229> this<00:03:29.379> may

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
and actually right here I think this may

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.409 
and actually right here I think this may
be<00:03:29.590> too<00:03:29.949> big<00:03:30.159> if<00:03:30.370> I<00:03:30.489> highlight<00:03:30.790> this<00:03:31.090> and<00:03:31.269> hit

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:31.419 
be too big if I highlight this and hit

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.890 
be too big if I highlight this and hit
f9<00:03:31.629> it's<00:03:32.440> too<00:03:32.769> long<00:03:32.979> to<00:03:33.239> evaluate<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:34.659> you<00:03:34.780> can

I<00:03:53.409> still<00:03:54.069> can't<00:03:54.280> evaluate<00:03:54.729> that<00:03:54.849> but<00:03:54.970> I<00:03:55.030> can

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
I still can't evaluate that but I can

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.719 
I still can't evaluate that but I can
hit<00:03:55.359> enter<00:03:55.510> and<00:03:55.750> there<00:03:55.900> it<00:03:56.019> is<00:03:56.370> 523<00:03:57.370> if<00:03:57.519> I<00:03:57.609> were

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:57.729 
hit enter and there it is 523 if I were

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:00.780 
hit enter and there it is 523 if I were
to<00:03:57.819> come<00:03:57.970> up<00:03:58.000> here<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.449> type<00:03:58.629> a<00:03:58.780> 2/3<00:03:59.790> there's

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
to come up here and type a 2/3 there's

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.899 
to come up here and type a 2/3 there's
24<00:04:01.769> now<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:02.979> formula<00:04:03.280> right<00:04:03.459> here<00:04:03.579> is

00:04:03.899 --> 00:04:03.909 
24 now this formula right here is

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.270 
24 now this formula right here is
awesome<00:04:04.810> if<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:05.109> don't<00:04:05.290> have<00:04:05.560> this<00:04:05.799> column

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:06.280 
awesome if you don't have this column

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.800 
awesome if you don't have this column
but<00:04:06.549> what<00:04:06.669> if<00:04:06.759> you<00:04:06.819> wanted<00:04:07.030> to<00:04:07.120> count<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.720> you

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
but what if you wanted to count and you

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:10.939 
but what if you wanted to count and you
have<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.169> column<00:04:08.439> you<00:04:08.470> would<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.919> use<00:04:09.870> count

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949 
have the column you would just use count

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.939 
have the column you would just use count
if<00:04:11.949> and<00:04:12.519> the<00:04:13.329> range<00:04:13.629> I'm<00:04:14.500> going<00:04:14.709> to<00:04:14.769> click

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:14.949 
if and the range I'm going to click

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:18.029 
if and the range I'm going to click
there<00:04:15.099> ctrl<00:04:15.579> shift<00:04:15.609> in<00:04:16.090> on<00:04:16.269> an<00:04:16.419> f4<00:04:17.109> comma<00:04:17.769> and

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
there ctrl shift in on an f4 comma and

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.520 
there ctrl shift in on an f4 comma and
then<00:04:18.219> true

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
then true

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.090 
then true
and<00:04:20.130> it<00:04:20.489> would<00:04:20.609> tell<00:04:20.760> us<00:04:21.590> 524<00:04:22.590> so<00:04:22.740> if<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.950> did

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
and it would tell us 524 so if you did

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.670 
and it would tell us 524 so if you did
have<00:04:23.340> this<00:04:23.610> then<00:04:24.050> do<00:04:25.050> that<00:04:25.200> and<00:04:25.260> if<00:04:25.560> you're

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
have this then do that and if you're

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.080 
have this then do that and if you're
going<00:04:25.770> to<00:04:25.860> filter<00:04:26.160> don't<00:04:26.490> leave<00:04:26.670> this<00:04:26.820> stuff

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
going to filter don't leave this stuff

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.200 
going to filter don't leave this stuff
here<00:04:27.150> sometimes<00:04:27.810> that<00:04:27.960> can<00:04:28.110> mess<00:04:28.530> things<00:04:28.860> up

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
here sometimes that can mess things up

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:38.970 
here sometimes that can mess things up
all<00:04:30.210> right<00:04:30.420> we'll<00:04:30.690> see<00:04:30.810> you<00:04:30.900> next<00:04:30.990> trick

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980
