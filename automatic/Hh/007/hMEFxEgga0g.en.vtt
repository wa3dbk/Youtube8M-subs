00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
features on the Rhino 5000 you have a

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.049 
features on the Rhino 5000 you have a
wrap<00:01:01.440> button<00:01:01.920> with<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.579> printer<00:01:02.940> is

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
wrap button with the printer is

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.509 
wrap button with the printer is
installed<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.780> ten<00:01:04.080> different<00:01:04.260> wire<00:01:04.739> sizes

we have a vertical feature the Rhino

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.609 
we have a vertical feature the Rhino
5000<00:01:32.040> also<00:01:32.369> does<00:01:32.700> two<00:01:33.270> different<00:01:33.630> barcodes<00:01:34.140> so

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
5000 also does two different barcodes so

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.560 
5000 also does two different barcodes so
if<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> bar<00:01:35.490> coding<00:01:35.909> function<00:01:36.390> or<00:01:36.540> a

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.850 
vary a little bit by Bram but let's say
in<00:02:25.860> this<00:02:25.950> case<00:02:26.010> that<00:02:26.580> our<00:02:27.450> ports<00:02:28.319> are<00:02:28.530> three

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
in this case that our ports are three

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.430 
in this case that our ports are three
quarters<00:02:29.190> of<00:02:29.520> an<00:02:29.640> inch<00:02:29.760> apart<00:02:30.180> so<00:02:31.170> we<00:02:31.200> would

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
quarters of an inch apart so we would

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.500 
quarters of an inch apart so we would
put<00:02:31.620> in<00:02:31.770> point<00:02:32.100> seven<00:02:32.520> five<00:02:32.730> which<00:02:33.090> is<00:02:33.270> already

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
put in point seven five which is already

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.770 
put in point seven five which is already
in<00:02:33.630> there<00:02:33.959> we<00:02:34.380> would<00:02:34.500> press<00:02:34.770> enter<00:02:35.750> now<00:02:36.750> the

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
in there we would press enter now the

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.780 
in there we would press enter now the
next<00:02:37.200> thing<00:02:37.410> we<00:02:37.530> would<00:02:37.680> do<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.890> press<00:02:38.400> this

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
next thing we would do is press this

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.440 
next thing we would do is press this
serial<00:02:39.390> hotkey<00:02:39.989> and<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:41.700> printers<00:02:42.030> are<00:02:42.270> set

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
serial hotkey and the printers are set

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.449 
serial hotkey and the printers are set
up<00:02:42.569> to<00:02:42.720> say<00:02:42.900> okay<00:02:43.200> how<00:02:43.470> many<00:02:43.530> ports<00:02:44.250> do<00:02:44.370> you

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
up to say okay how many ports do you

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:45.920 
up to say okay how many ports do you
have<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.819> have<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:44.970> six<00:02:45.330> port<00:02:45.660> patch<00:02:45.870> panel
