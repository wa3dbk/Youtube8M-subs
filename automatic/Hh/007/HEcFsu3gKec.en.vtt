 This time I introduced it because I bought it from the first Tokumitsu of the Audi a 1 released today. 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.330

 Yes yes 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.500
 Well 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.520
 It's a box 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.480
 Is the wisdom of this March 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:40.020
 I could not say that I was careful 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:44.040
 Well maybe from this month it will change to something like this warning 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.310
 It is difference of box This is ne from now 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.150
 And odm scale is 1/60 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:54.380
 Silver coin suspension and tool door opening and closing 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:54.380

 This is a little long time I do not read but solar 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.690
 This is a formula that is a seal 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.030
 I think by f 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:35.250

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.200
 It does not cost 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:57.220
 It is action avoidance 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:02.100
