00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.580
 the biker on the side of the highway 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.450
 Candid Portinari around the 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.969
 400 km in the sense that it is 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.310
 I am ready frank where today by 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.189
 morning a truck a bus 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.189
 workers ran over 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.340
 ten cows 10 to 12 cows 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.470
 the roadside and 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.529
 little does not happen a tragedy 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:35.070
 fortunately he did not have any victims 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.860
 inside the bus of workers but 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.910
 many cows died and the scene does not leave 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:45.060
 to be sad and pain here with you 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.789
 can see the edges of the highway 

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:50.760
 [Music] 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:52.590
 several dead cows when I got here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.899
 still at dawn 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.629
 the autovias staff tried to take 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.000
 some cows that had not been 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.530
 but were still at 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.799
 road margins 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.400
 risk to drivers of 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.400
 vehicles passing by 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.400
 is 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.690
 some are distant from each other 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.590
 It's hard to understand how this happened. 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:18.590
 same 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.880
 we do not have more information but it is 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.370
 complex it is difficult to understand how it is with 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.630
 Your bus and only vehicle despite being a 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.380
 a large bus a 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.950
 rural workers may run over 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:42.120
 so many cows at the same time, huh? 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.880
 they are scattered across the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:48.869
 by a stretch of approximately 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.930
 100 meters because it can be if you can see in the 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.930
 video 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.820
 still dark, not the image a little 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:05.560
 compromised by the lack of light 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.960
 but give to have a certain size than 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.770
 happened there could have been a 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.130
 tragedy 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:14.790
 clear is there were several workers 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:21.959
 rural areas within the bus but fortunately 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:21.959
 there were no more serious consequences 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.500
