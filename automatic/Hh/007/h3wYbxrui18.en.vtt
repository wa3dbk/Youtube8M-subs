00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.259 

then<00:03:15.799> we<00:03:15.920> use<00:03:16.040> the<00:03:16.280> foil<00:03:16.519> to<00:03:16.730> wrap<00:03:16.909> around<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
then we use the foil to wrap around the

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:20.309 
then we use the foil to wrap around the
coil<00:03:17.510> and<00:03:17.659> compact<00:03:18.170> it<00:03:18.319> into<00:03:18.530> the<00:03:18.620> ball

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
coil and compact it into the ball

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.240 
coil and compact it into the ball
traditionally<00:03:21.319> this<00:03:21.470> step<00:03:21.709> is<00:03:21.860> done<00:03:22.010> in<00:03:22.159> the

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
traditionally this step is done in the

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.860 
traditionally this step is done in the
palm<00:03:22.459> of<00:03:22.489> your<00:03:22.640> hand<00:03:22.760> but<00:03:23.269> the<00:03:23.360> coin<00:03:23.540> mixture

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:23.870 
palm of your hand but the coin mixture

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.839 
palm of your hand but the coin mixture
was<00:03:23.989> hot<00:03:24.260> so<00:03:24.560> Ouisa<00:03:24.739> aluminum<00:03:25.310> foil<00:03:25.579> to<00:03:25.670> help

00:03:25.839 --> 00:03:25.849 
was hot so Ouisa aluminum foil to help

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.680 
was hot so Ouisa aluminum foil to help
us<00:03:26.000> out

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690
