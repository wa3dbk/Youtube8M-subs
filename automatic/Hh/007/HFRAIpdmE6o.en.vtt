00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
 Hey guys! 

00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:08.000
 I Ikebukuro district game behind me and the girls are playing Disney Tsum Tsum game. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.280
 It looks really fun. 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:26.000
 Your task is to buy one character with 500 yen, it's like a keychain that you can then play. 

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:32.060
 I'm going to buy a keychain and hopefully get Irvikiss because I really want a cat character. 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 These are all options. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.180
 I would like to Irvikissan .. 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.700
 meow ~ 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:47.340
 Cat! Cat! Cat! 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.780
 It's Liisa! Okay, Liisa is cute. 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.480
 It's not a cat, but it avoids it. 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.840
 Okay, so .. 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.340
 The character gets used if I just get this open .. 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.280
 You take the little Tsum Tsum out of the package. 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.260
 Your character will appear on the screen and you can raise your character's level to gain access to a variety of skills. 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.840
 You touch the screen and combine Tsum Tsume's like. 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.300
 3 or better if you get more. 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.140
 This is my first time so I'm certainly bad. 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.320
 Omg, so hard! 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.480
 You can click on Liisa. 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:42.500
 So difficult! 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.700
 Yay! 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.400
 Second floor! 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:57.400
 That's it! 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.120

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.380
 Thanks for watching, sneak !!
