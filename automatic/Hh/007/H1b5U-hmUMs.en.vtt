00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
alternating wins and losses as an

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.179 
alternating wins and losses as an
example<00:01:27.640> in<00:01:27.909> the<00:01:27.939> video<00:01:28.270> I<00:01:28.619> 11<00:01:29.619> raised<00:01:29.920> and

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
example in the video I 11 raised and

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.100 
example in the video I 11 raised and
then<00:01:30.520> I<00:01:30.549> had<00:01:30.820> my<00:01:30.850> friend<00:01:31.270> when<00:01:31.600> another<00:01:31.869> race

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
then I had my friend when another race

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.480 
then I had my friend when another race
just<00:01:32.320> we<00:01:32.470> went<00:01:32.650> back<00:01:32.830> and<00:01:32.860> forth<00:01:33.100> back<00:01:33.460> and

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:33.490 
just we went back and forth back and

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.130 
just we went back and forth back and
forth<00:01:33.729> winning<00:01:34.240> and<00:01:34.360> losing<00:01:34.509> against<00:01:34.990> each

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
forth winning and losing against each

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.109 
forth winning and losing against each
other<00:01:35.350> just<00:01:35.860> so<00:01:35.979> we<00:01:36.100> could<00:01:36.250> keep<00:01:36.430> unlocking

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:37.119 
other just so we could keep unlocking

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:38.940 
other just so we could keep unlocking
stuff<00:01:37.330> and<00:01:37.540> eventually<00:01:37.810> we<00:01:38.170> were<00:01:38.409> able<00:01:38.439> to<00:01:38.770> get

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
stuff and eventually we were able to get

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.499 
stuff and eventually we were able to get
all<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.220> way<00:01:39.340> up<00:01:39.460> to<00:01:39.490> unlocking<00:01:39.939> the<00:01:40.150> turbo

00:01:40.499 --> 00:01:40.509 
all the way up to unlocking the turbo

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:42.149 
all the way up to unlocking the turbo
maybe<00:01:40.960> we<00:01:41.140> could<00:01:41.320> even<00:01:41.439> go<00:01:41.590> even<00:01:41.680> higher<00:01:42.100> a

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:42.159 
maybe we could even go even higher a

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:44.550 
maybe we could even go even higher a
little<00:01:42.580> later<00:01:42.790> but<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.360> will<00:01:43.810> relieve<00:01:44.140> a<00:01:44.380> lot

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
little later but this will relieve a lot

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.980 
little later but this will relieve a lot
of<00:01:44.619> that<00:01:44.860> stress<00:01:45.250> of<00:01:45.460> trying<00:01:45.970> to<00:01:46.329> win<00:01:46.479> a<00:01:46.509> ton<00:01:46.960> of

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:46.990 
of that stress of trying to win a ton of

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.230 
of that stress of trying to win a ton of
races<00:01:47.920> that<00:01:48.220> are<00:01:48.280> kind<00:01:48.759> of<00:01:48.820> hard<00:01:48.970> to<00:01:49.090> do

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
races that are kind of hard to do

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.550 
races that are kind of hard to do
because<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.540> know<00:01:49.659> how<00:01:49.780> many<00:01:49.930> try-hards<00:01:50.439> are

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
because you know how many try-hards are

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.340 
because you know how many try-hards are
out<00:01:50.650> there<00:01:50.829> and<00:01:51.159> luckily<00:01:51.850> the<00:01:52.509> nos<00:01:52.750> issue<00:01:53.079> is

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
out there and luckily the nos issue is

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.499 
out there and luckily the nos issue is
over<00:01:53.680> so<00:01:53.920> you<00:01:53.979> won't<00:01:54.250> really<00:01:54.549> get<00:01:54.970> blowing<00:01:55.390> out

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:55.509 
over so you won't really get blowing out

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.090 
over so you won't really get blowing out
the<00:01:55.540> water<00:01:55.869> anymore<00:01:56.259> but<00:01:56.650> there<00:01:56.860> are<00:01:56.979> still
