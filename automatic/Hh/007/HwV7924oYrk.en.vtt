00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.569
 hi again people like they have been good 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.340
 in this video I will show you some of 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.160
 the differences between the cars 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.560
 2002 when intecmar the normal and the version 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.630
 to the king as you will know the first 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.730
 version of this game that came out in 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.470
 2009 had many errors of 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.480
 programming I mean the horrible ones 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.490
 books of golds and cris for example the 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.560
 system was somewhat unbalanced and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 they omitted some minimal details but 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.880
 important 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.369
 a year later in 2010 the version comes out 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.129
 that repairing the aforementioned errors 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.079
 before balancing the system so the 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.359
 playability and improving graphics 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:42.180
 well, in my opinion there is not much 

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:44.219
 notorious difference in graphics let's go 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.620
 now what the video is about at first 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.719
 impression the opening is the same in the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 press start screen we can 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.530
 Note that only the year of 2009 changes 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.079
 to 2010 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.820
 wow the big difference no but it's the 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.280
 first step to know what version 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.379
 you have now we go with the details 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.690
 minimal but important that they omitted 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.090
 for example we have the glass super 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.200
 where they forgot to put the sphere 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.159
 abode but that in the 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.079
 and it appears again as in 499 is the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.420
 only retail difference that I could 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:18.299
 find if some of you know 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.310
 another would be good to share it good 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.920
 now let's move on to the differences more 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.110
 important the first for launch 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.780
 of attacks for example this movement 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 of time on when roda is invulnerable and 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.590
 nothing can hit him but that was fixed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.229
 in the tourette and is no longer invulnerable 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.420
 another the jury kick in the first 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:40.820
 version recovers quickly after 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.740
 to paste and where to remove gives a 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.569
 little more in returning to the neutral state 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.569
 let's see the best in slow motion 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.230
 this hey verne technique is just as 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.550
 quick that in with 98 but he does not have 

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.550
 a delay at the beginning 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.240
 the infinite combo define with the jane with 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.660
 I volley in front of the mass I made in the toga and 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.660
 it is no longer 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.810
 the new super wii who skillful and cinnamon 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.120
 he subtracted part of the life bar in 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.350
 brass and it was fixed now the damage is 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.440
 full 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:33.010
 still it still has bugs but they are not 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.010
 so serious 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:45.110
 and the data from the memory card of the 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:47.930
 normal are not compatible with the chump 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.150
 so you have to start from scratch 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.700
 gentlemen those are all the changes that 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.340
 I could find if any of you know 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:57.620
 another would be great to share them without 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:00.140
 nothing more to say that is all people 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.710
 greetings and thanks for watching us 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.710
 see you soon
