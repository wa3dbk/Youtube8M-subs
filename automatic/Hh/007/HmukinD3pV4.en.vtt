a<00:00:15.560> comparison<00:00:16.250> between<00:00:16.370> the<00:00:16.580> iPhone

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:17.230 
a comparison between the iPhone

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.080 
a comparison between the iPhone
five<00:00:17.380> s<00:00:17.590> all<00:00:17.859> the<00:00:17.980> way<00:00:18.070> down<00:00:18.220> to<00:00:18.369> the<00:00:18.460> 2g<00:00:18.670> now<00:00:19.060> I

with<00:00:21.220> the<00:00:21.400> release<00:00:21.580> of<00:00:21.820> the<00:00:21.970> original<00:00:22.300> iPhone

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
with the release of the original iPhone

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.570 
with the release of the original iPhone
5<00:00:22.869> and<00:00:23.170> I<00:00:23.230> really<00:00:23.470> like<00:00:23.650> this<00:00:23.830> so<00:00:24.099> here<00:00:24.369> we<00:00:24.460> go

now in advance I do apologize for the
number<00:00:27.099> of<00:00:27.189> hands<00:00:27.610> on<00:00:27.730> the<00:00:27.849> screen<00:00:28.240> I<00:00:28.270> had<00:00:28.750> to

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:28.840 
number of hands on the screen I had to

here<00:00:31.360> is<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.779> original<00:00:32.010> down<00:00:33.010> test<00:00:33.370> on<00:00:33.670> all

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:34.030 
here is the original down test on all

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.060 
here is the original down test on all
devices<00:00:34.210> when<00:00:34.720> I<00:00:34.809> let<00:00:34.989> go<00:00:35.019> at<00:00:35.290> the<00:00:35.320> exact<00:00:35.800> same

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
devices when I let go at the exact same

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.130 
devices when I let go at the exact same
time<00:00:36.400> so<00:00:36.699> there<00:00:37.570> it<00:00:37.690> goes

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
time so there it goes

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.710 
time so there it goes
surprisingly<00:00:38.830> the<00:00:39.070> 3GS<00:00:39.550> was<00:00:39.850> first<00:00:40.210> followed

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:40.720 
surprisingly the 3GS was first followed

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.110 
surprisingly the 3GS was first followed
by<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.870> 3G<00:00:41.410> then<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.040> four<00:00:42.280> and<00:00:42.550> then<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.790> 2g

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
by the 3G then the four and then the 2g

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.240 
by the 3G then the four and then the 2g
there's<00:00:43.629> something<00:00:44.019> about<00:00:44.230> I<00:00:44.260> was<00:00:44.710> six<00:00:45.040> and

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
there's something about I was six and

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.130 
there's something about I was six and
lower<00:00:45.430> that<00:00:45.699> actually<00:00:46.180> makes<00:00:46.480> the<00:00:46.720> shutdown

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.140 
lower that actually makes the shutdown

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.380 
lower that actually makes the shutdown
time<00:00:47.350> a<00:00:47.559> lot<00:00:47.800> faster<00:00:48.339> than<00:00:48.489> I<00:00:48.640> was<00:00:48.879> seven

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:49.390 
time a lot faster than I was seven

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.540 
time a lot faster than I was seven
although<00:00:49.899> all<00:00:50.079> devices<00:00:50.379> on<00:00:50.649> Iowa<00:00:51.010> seven<00:00:51.340> shut

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 
although all devices on Iowa seven shut

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.760 
although all devices on Iowa seven shut
down<00:00:51.699> at<00:00:51.910> the<00:00:52.030> exact<00:00:52.539> same<00:00:52.870> time<00:00:53.199> which<00:00:53.500> makes

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
down at the exact same time which makes

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.160 
down at the exact same time which makes
me<00:00:53.980> think<00:00:54.010> what<00:00:54.670> do<00:00:54.850> they<00:00:54.969> change<00:00:55.239> and<00:00:55.600> in<00:00:56.079> a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
me think what do they change and in a

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.869 
me think what do they change and in a
second<00:00:56.500> here<00:00:56.649> they<00:00:56.770> should<00:00:57.129> all<00:00:57.370> be<00:00:57.399> turning

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:57.879 
second here they should all be turning

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.849 
second here they should all be turning
off<00:00:57.969> at<00:00:58.210> the<00:00:58.329> exact<00:00:58.600> same<00:00:58.899> time<00:00:59.260> now<00:00:59.620> all

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
off at the exact same time now all

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.439 
off at the exact same time now all
performing<00:01:00.370> the<00:01:00.489> boot<00:01:00.670> up<00:01:00.789> test<00:01:01.000> I<00:01:01.149> just<00:01:01.180> want

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
performing the boot up test I just want

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.819 
performing the boot up test I just want
to<00:01:01.510> let<00:01:01.600> you<00:01:01.690> guys<00:01:01.809> know<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.230> important<00:01:02.710> to

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
to let you guys know it's important to

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:05.219 
to let you guys know it's important to
notice<00:01:03.100> that<00:01:03.789> from<00:01:04.000> the<00:01:04.059> 5s<00:01:04.629> end<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.019> the<00:01:05.080> 2g

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
notice that from the 5s end of the 2g

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:06.990 
notice that from the 5s end of the 2g
there<00:01:05.560> is<00:01:05.649> a<00:01:05.680> massive<00:01:06.340> difference<00:01:06.490> in

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
there is a massive difference in

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.840 
there is a massive difference in
processing<00:01:07.570> power<00:01:07.750> and<00:01:07.930> RAM<00:01:08.289> obviously<00:01:09.100> also

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
processing power and RAM obviously also

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.400 
processing power and RAM obviously also
the<00:01:09.970> software<00:01:10.330> is<00:01:10.539> different<00:01:10.990> so<00:01:11.080> that<00:01:11.110> could

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
the software is different so that could

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.800 
the software is different so that could
majorly<00:01:11.800> affect<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.490> now<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:13.119> was<00:01:13.600> a<00:01:13.630> to

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
majorly affect this now I was a to

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.630 
majorly affect this now I was a to
surprise<00:01:14.170> because<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.619> 5s<00:01:15.009> of<00:01:15.190> course<00:01:15.399> came

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:15.640 
surprise because the 5s of course came

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:17.520 
surprise because the 5s of course came
in<00:01:15.759> first<00:01:16.060> followed<00:01:16.539> by<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:16.960> five<00:01:17.289> and<00:01:17.500> five

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
in first followed by the five and five

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.919 
in first followed by the five and five
see<00:01:18.039> what<00:01:18.490> came<00:01:18.729> next<00:01:18.940> was<00:01:19.119> actually<00:01:19.750> pretty

00:01:19.919 --> 00:01:19.929 
see what came next was actually pretty

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:21.540 
see what came next was actually pretty
surprising<00:01:20.350> and<00:01:20.679> just<00:01:20.890> to<00:01:21.009> let<00:01:21.070> you<00:01:21.190> guys<00:01:21.220> know

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
surprising and just to let you guys know

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.460 
surprising and just to let you guys know
all<00:01:21.700> of<00:01:21.789> these<00:01:22.330> devices<00:01:22.630> are<00:01:22.869> freshly

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
all of these devices are freshly

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:25.830 
all of these devices are freshly
restored<00:01:23.619> non-jailbroken<00:01:24.520> completely<00:01:25.479> stock

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
restored non-jailbroken completely stock

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.900 
restored non-jailbroken completely stock
so<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.289> 5c<00:01:26.800> and<00:01:26.830> five<00:01:27.160> was<00:01:27.429> followed<00:01:27.759> by<00:01:27.880> the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
so the 5c and five was followed by the

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.260 
so the 5c and five was followed by the
4s<00:01:28.390> and<00:01:28.590> surprisingly<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.890> 2g<00:01:30.250> came<00:01:31.060> before

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 
4s and surprisingly the 2g came before

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.559 
4s and surprisingly the 2g came before
the<00:01:31.630> iPhone<00:01:31.780> 4<00:01:32.289> then<00:01:32.950> the<00:01:33.099> 3GS<00:01:33.580> then<00:01:34.390> the

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
the iPhone 4 then the 3GS then the

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.130 
the iPhone 4 then the 3GS then the
iPhone<00:01:34.929> 4<00:01:35.319> and<00:01:35.560> then<00:01:36.280> the<00:01:36.310> iPhone<00:01:36.910> 3G<00:01:37.420> at<00:01:37.810> long

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
iPhone 4 and then the iPhone 3G at long

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.199 
iPhone 4 and then the iPhone 3G at long
last<00:01:38.410> I<00:01:38.860> was<00:01:39.130> actually<00:01:39.310> really<00:01:39.729> surprising

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
last I was actually really surprising

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:42.059 
last I was actually really surprising
for<00:01:40.390> me<00:01:40.539> to<00:01:40.690> see<00:01:40.899> because<00:01:41.050> these<00:01:41.709> are<00:01:41.890> all

00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:42.069 
for me to see because these are all

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:44.370 
for me to see because these are all
running<00:01:42.399> the<00:01:42.580> latest<00:01:42.819> firmware<00:01:43.209> and<00:01:43.869> the<00:01:44.110> 2g

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
running the latest firmware and the 2g

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.889 
running the latest firmware and the 2g
is<00:01:44.739> obviously<00:01:45.340> not<00:01:45.670> as<00:01:45.819> powerful<00:01:46.000> as<00:01:46.390> the<00:01:46.599> four

00:01:46.889 --> 00:01:46.899 
is obviously not as powerful as the four

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.990 
is obviously not as powerful as the four
it's<00:01:47.500> just<00:01:47.770> the<00:01:47.860> booting<00:01:48.190> sequence<00:01:48.670> in<00:01:48.910> the

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
it's just the booting sequence in the

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.910 
it's just the booting sequence in the
way<00:01:49.149> it<00:01:49.270> works<00:01:49.509> probably<00:01:49.929> was<00:01:50.349> changed<00:01:50.770> in

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
way it works probably was changed in

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.400 
way it works probably was changed in
Iowa<00:01:51.310> seven<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.509> could<00:01:52.750> be<00:01:52.840> a<00:01:52.869> fault<00:01:53.200> now

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
Iowa seven so that could be a fault now

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.960 
Iowa seven so that could be a fault now
for<00:01:53.619> the<00:01:53.679> last<00:01:53.860> couple<00:01:54.039> of<00:01:54.250> tests<00:01:54.640> I'm<00:01:54.789> gonna

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:54.970 
for the last couple of tests I'm gonna

in this test as well as all others then

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:26.369 
in this test as well as all others then
comes<00:02:23.980> the<00:02:24.129> 5<00:02:24.340> then<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.670> 5c<00:02:25.150> then<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.480> 4s<00:02:25.989> and

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
comes the 5 then the 5c then the 4s and

comes the 5 then the 5c then the 4s and
then<00:02:26.590> the<00:02:26.709> 4<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.310> so<00:02:27.579> on<00:02:27.609> so<00:02:28.209> what<00:02:28.359> did<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.569> learn

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
then the 4 and so on so what did I learn

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.430 
then the 4 and so on so what did I learn
doing<00:02:28.989> these<00:02:29.260> tests<00:02:29.680> I

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
doing these tests I

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.350 
doing these tests I
that<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.830> amount<00:02:31.220> of<00:02:31.310> processing<00:02:31.730> power<00:02:32.030> is

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
that the amount of processing power is

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.030 
that the amount of processing power is
greater<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.810> course<00:02:33.110> as<00:02:33.260> a<00:02:33.290> generation<00:02:33.830> goes

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
greater of course as a generation goes

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.730 
greater of course as a generation goes
on<00:02:34.220> but<00:02:34.760> it's<00:02:34.910> marginally<00:02:35.720> less<00:02:36.110> noticeable

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:36.740 
on but it's marginally less noticeable

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.190 
on but it's marginally less noticeable
the<00:02:37.100> higher<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.550> go<00:02:37.760> so<00:02:38.150> if<00:02:38.570> you<00:02:38.720> have<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.870> five

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the higher you go so if you have a five

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.200 
the higher you go so if you have a five
I<00:02:39.560> wouldn't<00:02:40.220> really<00:02:40.400> recommend<00:02:40.520> upgrading

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:41.210 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.910 
I wouldn't really recommend upgrading
you<00:02:41.480> know<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.600> 5s<00:02:42.050> just<00:02:42.320> based<00:02:42.500> on<00:02:42.620> the<00:02:42.710> fact

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920 
you know a 5s just based on the fact

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.470 
you know a 5s just based on the fact
that<00:02:43.040> you<00:02:43.190> want<00:02:43.400> extra<00:02:43.790> little<00:02:44.120> bit<00:02:44.210> of<00:02:44.300> power

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
that you want extra little bit of power

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:46.240 
that you want extra little bit of power
because<00:02:44.780> it<00:02:45.020> has<00:02:45.260> an<00:02:45.440> amazing<00:02:45.950> amount<00:02:46.040> of

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
because it has an amazing amount of

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:47.710 
because it has an amazing amount of
power<00:02:46.460> as<00:02:46.700> it<00:02:46.850> is<00:02:47.030> if<00:02:47.330> you're<00:02:47.510> always

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
power as it is if you're always

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.330 
power as it is if you're always
upgrading<00:02:48.290> to<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.560> latest<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.040> greatest

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:49.340 
upgrading to the latest and greatest

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.430 
upgrading to the latest and greatest
just<00:02:49.790> based<00:02:50.030> on<00:02:50.210> that<00:02:50.270> little<00:02:50.810> spike<00:02:51.080> in<00:02:51.260> power

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:51.440 
just based on that little spike in power

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.200 
just based on that little spike in power
you<00:02:52.010> know<00:02:52.100> this<00:02:52.250> video<00:02:52.460> I<00:02:52.610> just<00:02:52.910> showed<00:02:53.060> you
