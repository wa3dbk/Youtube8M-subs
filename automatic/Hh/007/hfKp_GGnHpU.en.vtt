dollars um did that mess in my head so

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.050 
dollars um did that mess in my head so
may<00:06:54.210> not<00:06:54.390> be<00:06:54.510> right<00:06:54.660> I<00:06:55.670> just<00:06:56.670> kind<00:06:56.880> of<00:06:56.940> the

00:06:57.050 --> 00:06:57.060 
may not be right I just kind of the

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.370 
may not be right I just kind of the
pallet<00:06:57.420> the<00:06:57.510> Coastal<00:06:57.840> Scents<00:06:57.960> palette<00:06:58.110> has

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
pallet the Coastal Scents palette has

00:06:58.380 --> 00:06:59.840 
pallet the Coastal Scents palette has
twenty<00:06:58.710> dollars<00:06:58.980> because<00:06:59.130> they<00:06:59.370> say<00:06:59.580> it's<00:06:59.730> on

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
twenty dollars because they say it's on

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.480 
twenty dollars because they say it's on
sale<00:07:00.030> for<00:07:00.210> 20<00:07:00.540> um<00:07:01.290> so<00:07:01.710> I<00:07:01.740> would<00:07:01.950> assume<00:07:02.070> that

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
sale for 20 um so I would assume that

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.220 
sale for 20 um so I would assume that
maybe<00:07:02.970> it's<00:07:03.180> being<00:07:03.420> discontinued<00:07:04.080> or

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:04.230 
maybe it's being discontinued or

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:05.810 
maybe it's being discontinued or
something<00:07:04.560> like<00:07:04.680> that<00:07:04.740> if<00:07:05.070> they're<00:07:05.610> going<00:07:05.730> to

00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:05.820 
something like that if they're going to

00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.210 
something like that if they're going to
print<00:07:06.090> this<00:07:06.300> on<00:07:06.570> here<00:07:06.930> like<00:07:07.710> I<00:07:07.890> would<00:07:08.190> just

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
print this on here like I would just

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:09.620 
print this on here like I would just
assume<00:07:08.520> that<00:07:08.850> it's<00:07:09.060> not<00:07:09.210> going<00:07:09.360> to<00:07:09.450> be<00:07:09.540> around

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:09.630 
assume that it's not going to be around

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:11.600 
assume that it's not going to be around
much<00:07:10.110> longer<00:07:10.140> or<00:07:10.860> something<00:07:11.190> like<00:07:11.280> that<00:07:11.340> I

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:11.610 
much longer or something like that I

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:12.740 
much longer or something like that I
don't<00:07:11.790> know<00:07:11.850> I<00:07:11.880> think<00:07:12.330> that<00:07:12.480> that's<00:07:12.600> really

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
don't know I think that that's really

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.470 
don't know I think that that's really
weird<00:07:13.110> like<00:07:13.440> I<00:07:13.700> wouldn't<00:07:14.700> post<00:07:14.910> a<00:07:15.090> sale<00:07:15.300> price
