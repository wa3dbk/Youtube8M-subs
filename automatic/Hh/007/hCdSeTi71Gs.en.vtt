00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 quinones is like a second stage simó in the program conscience 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:05.880
 sensory but moral conscience 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.429
 then all that has to like the exmiss universe to lescano order 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:11.409
 through reason and logic 

00:00:11.409 --> 00:00:12.589
 people 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.019
 said that must also have unity among its diversity 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.560
 not be chaotic 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.830
 be within an order within a plan 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.029
 that involves everyone else 

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.919
 to plants animals to other human beings certainly not 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.220
 we can not achieve it unilaterally 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.009
 we consult in the universe 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.950
 and all that has unity within its apparent diversity 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.340
 so we have to integrate and spiritually for love 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.500
 to the whole 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.810
 but in synthesis 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.190
 all this implies 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.920
 self-discipline 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.059
 but let it be clear 

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.949
 discipline self-discipline freely consented by oneself 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:52.620
 like a price that you have to pay for a life and in my life 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.260
 9 if you have tax 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.520
 that is unworthy of a human being 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.790
 self-discipline 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.530
 is a very young girl otherwise young 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.000
 I am an optimist young people in life we ​​are looking for 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.030
 we make it clear it does not form a little crazy chardy 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.560
 well we look for all the young people the spokesperson was granted added that I have already 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.860
 many years 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.750
 receipt open in the shade 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.950
 to the search that is to be young 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.180
 Don Pablo Picasso, for example, died young 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.130
 at 93 years old 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.590
 I kept looking 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.540
 changed from 18 years was so far 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.390
 give him good to know nothing of anything would not have worked in the world is bad 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.640
 has looked for the way to play that from here 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.670
 with the rise evasion 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.170
 or with becoming another reality like the one that proposes chestnuts 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.620
 that passion is cowardice 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.120
 To be young is to be open to love and enthusiasm to search the night 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.909
 until the last moment 

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.760
 the cycle and its encirclement 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.380
 adn that he sent today with a cane out there 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.370
 you can still be young 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.430
 and jose diego 18 years good 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.670
 cars and end this 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.820
 that price 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.770
 that you have to pay percent 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.620
 and without giving up 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:06.720
 and sexual act 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.479
 neither moral nor intellectual nor mystical 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.469
 all that 

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:15.159
 but with non-mystical height of chest strokes and in a corner full of fear 

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.879
 everything is sin we have left mexico 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:18.939
 he is coward 

00:02:18.939 --> 00:02:22.839
 today when the current one I think maybe difficult is when it arrives it is expected that 

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:23.200
 yes 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.340
 reasons to do it 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.179
 and we remain efficient 

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:28.549
 for this very reason 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.209
 with another sentimentalist 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:32.160
 to poor sentimentality 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.149
 the cult of the martyrs the cult of the losers 

00:02:35.149 --> 00:02:40.309
 that's a trap of lego pd studies losers uncheck god I understand you 

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:43.889
 I admire but Messi is superior to you because I'm not suffering as much as you 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:45.539
 it's about diego is 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:47.959
 let's go sensuality not sensoriality 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:51.999
 and then so that they do not close you are wrong the senses if to detect 

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:53.329
 the wisdom 

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:55.519
 dignity beauty 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.049
 of the world 

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.039
 and the events is so happy 

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:01.339
 pashanski 

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:02.869
 the young cm 

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:05.159
 the practice are looking 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.159
 A solution is also being sought for a semi-fund and they are lacking 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.339
 information 

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:14.499
 and even worse, the people who come to them with misinformation 

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:17.499
 in search of proselytes in search of 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:20.699
 votes for some political party 

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.790
 we have not been honest enough fox 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:25.170
 by the simple 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.029
 those that we have to adapt we want conditioned 

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.480
 so that I continued in what we believed and could not perform 

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:33.979
 so that they do not follow years 

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:35.720
 in a way we are like him 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.599
 all that 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.709
 I could limit and thrive I live 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.420
 with your violin I mentioned that you have to intervene 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.049
 about those who are playing with their faith 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:44.869
 still their caretakers 

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:48.469
 so we want to say with young people that we continue expeditions that do what 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:50.259
 we could not do it 

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:51.569
 and things like that 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.599
 you have to give them more freedom leaders a blackout of this information 

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:57.619
 that is found 

00:03:57.619 --> 00:04:00.639
 that he has to pay a price for using his Buenos Aires discipline 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:04.159
 according to the warehouse explained 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:07.879
 querol of the light information so that they continue in our institution so that 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:09.900
 follow our political party 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.909
 forecast 2 3% 

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:14.779
 during the most distant earthquake they choose 

00:04:14.779 --> 00:04:17.359
 for example Chestnut political calaos 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:19.889
 castañeda is discarded marine is fashionable 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:24.389
 it became fashionable ethical the rise of four women is poorly made wrong and not 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.599
 he left the field and urbanized I wish him luck because it is a trap that 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:32.400
 On the one hand, the search for the other reality 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.150
 on Saturday because reality is your reality, not reality is reality 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.279
 but it's reality is a reality 

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:42.010
 they are not delibasic proof and the dog actually 

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.930
 the bad of the civil protection development units 

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.680
 to his intellectual spiritual development and he added I do not think he's the one 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:50.000
 they are interested in others 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.430
 that altered altered trunk consciousness states are not stations of 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.220
 consciousness and a very big difference peking the expansion of consciousness that 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.460
 allows us 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.789
 assimilate what I do manuitt and transcend 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:05.350
 and fully integrate as human beings 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.920
 but today in the consciousness station the blues to lose consciousness 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.410
 that is a reality at our pleasure and of course if the other day consuming 

00:05:13.029 --> 00:05:15.009
 that what happens to us most 

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:17.259
 we are ending this life cycle 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:18.520
 we have done nothing 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.150
 it's not screaming and 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.610
 we spoil his life 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.110
 it's an honor that reality has to be clarified 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:29.680
 it is perfectly scientifically identifiable if there is a large 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:32.779
 number of altered states of consciousness that people confuse 

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:35.910
 with the other world with the sky 

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:40.270
 with talking to god with experienced experience and he has stayed until the 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:43.710
 custom of experience by experience itself without knowing for what 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.039
 serves the experience 

00:05:45.039 --> 00:05:47.800
 and all that is like walking around eating any trash 

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:50.419
 to see what the garbage is for 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:52.949
 I already know that there is a search and a selection 

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:56.460
 there is a lot of information was we bring from the time of the shamans 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:59.150
 the shameful verdolagas its objective is that the
