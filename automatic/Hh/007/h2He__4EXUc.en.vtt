00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello hunters welcome to the channel 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.599
 see here we are with armor 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:21.950
 of monster hunter 4 of high rank and is 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:25.710
 the turn of lagoa ex for swordsman 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.490
 this armor is weird 7 and it has six 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.330
 Slots 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.750
 his basic defense per piece is 58 what 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:38.530
 that makes a total of 290 and can get 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:42.540
 to a maximum per piece of 111 what 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.030
 would make a total of 555 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:49.130
 and as always we dedicate this look 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.580
 exterior as detailed as possible 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.620
 let's now go up here behind that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.780
 yes for my taste I would need a 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.160
 small capita but it's great 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.340
 aesthetically this armor 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.309
 and already done the outside glance we're going to 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.990
 go to the inside look and we'll start 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.570
 as we always do for 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.200
 elementary resistors this armor 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:16.800
 it has minus 45 to fire 15 to water less 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.560
 15 to thunder 10 to ice and minus 10 to 

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.440
 dragon let's see the skills in 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.780
 active that has the first is spirit 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.410
 plus two increase your capabilities when 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.380
 a big monster gets angry the second 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.720
 is biologist plus one in showing people 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.520
 at 4 there is one more level increases the 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.369
 success rate by combining pumps 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.470
 dung cancels the blas flight and prevents 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.770
 the stink state and the third is the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:45.440
 negative is resistance to fire 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.870
 negative 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.490
 Well, seeing this, we turn to the table 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.890
 of the skills and how they are 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.930
 distributed your points here the first 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.930
 it's spirit more 2 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:03.340
 the second one that we find is 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.340
 biologist plus one 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:08.259
 and the next one is the negative 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.759
 resistance to negative fire and also 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.310
 we have a few skills with 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:16.209
 a few small dots to be here is 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:18.460
 artisan 5 points increases a level of 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.300
 sharpening the gun 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:26.050
 the one that follows below with three points is 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:28.390
 Fencing prevents your attacks from being 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.060
 Rejected 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:35.380
 but we still have more the next just 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.970
 under two dots for firm defense 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.280
 which is a new monster skill 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.760
 Hunter 4 has the same effects as 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.820
 defense plus 3 and iron skin and the 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.709
 last with a little acrobat 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.050
 it's a new skill it has the same 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.310
 Effects that evasion plus 1 constitution + 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:55.400
 1 and passive distance 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.349
 let's move now to the piece by piece 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:03:02.190
 we start as always by the helmet and in 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:03.270
 this case gives us a slot you know 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.640
 that the bottom of the screen 

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:07.290
 we can translate the first little screen 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.540
 what comes out of us are the resistances 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:11.430
 elementals and the latter that we put 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.920
 which they are the points that give us 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.810
 skill each of the pieces 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.790
 next piece the chest also gives us 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.459
 a slot 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.970
 and we are going through little screens until we arrive 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.920
 to this one here 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:27.560
 and now let's move on to the next 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.860
 piece that are the gloves that in this 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:32.960
 case does not give us any groove 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.880
 and we are going there description 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.990
 active skills up points 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.430
 by skill 

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:39.840
 in the points of each of the 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.700
 skills that this piece gives us in 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:46.120
 concrete we pass to the belt 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.540
 that gives us two slots 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.269
 and there we are until this little screen 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:55.120
 is the one that interests us since you know it and 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:57.950
 finally we have the pants that 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.220
 they give us two slots 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.420
 and I'm going to start saying goodbye and 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.260
 what 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:10.170
 tiring this has been the armor for 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.069
 swordswoman of the ex 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:16.410
 let's dedicate here one last look 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.180
 and well I would put a small layer to 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.680
 he is just like he has given tea 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:23.010
 a scarf is resonant a small 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:25.200
 layer but good hunters I hope that you 

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:29.240
 I liked that you have good houses and 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.240
 see you in future videos see you later
