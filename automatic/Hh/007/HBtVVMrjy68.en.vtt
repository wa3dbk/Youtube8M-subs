you guys let you know what I did

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.410 
you guys let you know what I did
differently<00:00:59.219> see<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.670> maybe<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.210> find

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
differently see if maybe we can find

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
differently see if maybe we can find
some<00:01:00.809> sort<00:01:01.050> of<00:01:01.109> solution<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.739> this<00:01:01.890> but<00:01:02.430> at<00:01:02.760> the

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
some sort of solution to this but at the

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.119 
some sort of solution to this but at the
end<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> day<00:01:03.510> I<00:01:03.780> still<00:01:04.439> think<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.920> system

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
end of the day I still think this system

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.270 
end of the day I still think this system
is<00:01:05.489> very<00:01:05.820> very<00:01:06.090> poor<00:01:06.420> and<00:01:06.840> it<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.409> unfair<00:01:07.950> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
is very very poor and it is unfair to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.190 
is very very poor and it is unfair to
underprivileged<00:01:08.880> channels<00:01:09.600> and<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.020> I'm

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
underprivileged channels and so I'm

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.859 
underprivileged channels and so I'm
keeping<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.799> original<00:01:11.250> video<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.820> so<00:01:12.510> here's

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
keeping the original video up so here's

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.490 
keeping the original video up so here's
what<00:01:13.020> happened

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
what happened

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.830 
what happened
since<00:01:14.010> then<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.520> tried<00:01:14.909> working<00:01:15.090> additionally

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
since then I tried working additionally

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.359 
since then I tried working additionally
with<00:01:15.960> Maker<00:01:16.200> they<00:01:16.560> thought<00:01:16.799> maybe<00:01:16.950> they<00:01:17.100> could

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
with Maker they thought maybe they could

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.190 
with Maker they thought maybe they could
do<00:01:17.490> something<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.850> try<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.360> escalate<00:01:18.810> my<00:01:18.840> case

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
do something to try and escalate my case

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.560 
do something to try and escalate my case
and<00:01:19.560> get<00:01:19.710> in<00:01:19.799> contact<00:01:20.040> YouTube<00:01:20.729> one<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.479> those

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
and get in contact YouTube one of those

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.330 
and get in contact YouTube one of those
things<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.229> they<00:01:22.380> thought<00:01:22.590> would<00:01:22.770> help<00:01:23.130> my

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
things that they thought would help my

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.969 
things that they thought would help my
case<00:01:23.610> would<00:01:24.060> be<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.479> make<00:01:24.659> my<00:01:24.930> complaint<00:01:25.619> video

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
case would be to make my complaint video

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.120 
case would be to make my complaint video
private<00:01:26.640> not<00:01:27.240> necessarily<00:01:27.960> because<00:01:28.170> what<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
private not necessarily because what I

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.999 
private not necessarily because what I
was<00:01:29.549> saying<00:01:29.820> wasn't<00:01:30.090> true<00:01:30.479> but<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.500> I<00:01:31.530> did

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
was saying wasn't true but because I did

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:19.340 
seems like it could be related to my

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:21.280 
seems like it could be related to my
case<00:05:19.580> and<00:05:19.910> that<00:05:20.000> is<00:05:20.090> that<00:05:20.270> they<00:05:20.780> seem<00:05:21.020> to<00:05:21.169> have

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:21.290 
case and that is that they seem to have

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:23.830 
case and that is that they seem to have
given<00:05:21.560> around<00:05:21.950> 200<00:05:22.669> organizations<00:05:22.880> the<00:05:23.660> power

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
given around 200 organizations the power

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:26.620 
given around 200 organizations the power
to<00:05:24.169> flag<00:05:25.130> better<00:05:25.580> than<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.000> average<00:05:26.180> person

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:26.630 
to flag better than the average person

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:30.310 
to flag better than the average person
and<00:05:27.080> so<00:05:27.590> that<00:05:28.010> allows<00:05:28.750> corporations<00:05:29.750> some<00:05:30.200> of

and so that allows corporations some of

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.550 
and so that allows corporations some of
them<00:05:30.440> were<00:05:31.400> like<00:05:31.580> scam<00:05:32.270> 404<00:05:32.990> I<00:05:33.020> think<00:05:33.320> was<00:05:33.440> the

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
them were like scam 404 I think was the

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
it's completely fraudulent so if I had

it's completely fraudulent so if I had
to<00:06:31.190> say<00:06:31.370> anything<00:06:31.640> I<00:06:32.000> guess<00:06:32.300> if<00:06:32.540> you<00:06:32.660> get<00:06:32.900> in

one<00:06:33.500> of<00:06:33.590> these<00:06:33.710> scenarios<00:06:34.150> it's<00:06:35.150> all<00:06:35.360> about

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
one of these scenarios it's all about

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.510 
one of these scenarios it's all about
who<00:06:35.870> you<00:06:35.900> know<00:06:36.080> and<00:06:36.500> not<00:06:36.620> what<00:06:36.860> you<00:06:37.010> know<00:06:37.220> and

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
who you know and not what you know and

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:40.090 
who you know and not what you know and
that's<00:06:37.820> why<00:06:38.060> it's<00:06:38.240> not<00:06:38.419> a<00:06:38.479> good<00:06:38.780> system<00:06:39.080> I

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
that's why it's not a good system I

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.010 
that's why it's not a good system I
it<00:06:40.310> was<00:06:40.520> my<00:06:40.700> connections<00:06:41.270> and<00:06:41.450> my<00:06:41.630> friend<00:06:41.900> from
