00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:55.689 

think<00:00:42.480> your<00:00:42.809> tone<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.320> addicted<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.739> rope<00:00:44.070> and

I think the only reason this entire

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.549 
I think the only reason this entire
episode<00:01:00.899> exists<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.590> because<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.890> future<00:01:02.219> cool

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
the funny thing is that that lotion

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
the funny thing is that that lotion
Shogun<00:01:06.689> for<00:01:06.840> some<00:01:06.960> reason<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.290> became<00:01:07.500> a

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
Shogun for some reason that became a

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950
