00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.120
 but also thanks to forget iwork.com 

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.799
 today I bring you a comparison between two 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.889
 processors as latest as the 

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.650
 snapdragon is the 801 and the standard with 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:14.900
 that 800 our YouTube channel 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.460
 Find us on Facebook and follow us on 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.640
 twitter so you do not miss content 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.080
 new and to day 5 I have a stump in this 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.270
 comparative brief we are giving two 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.790
 terminals he chooses two using the 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.050
 snapdragon 800 and that is currently in 

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:33.110
 kit kat 4.4 point 2 and the htc one e-mail 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:38.510
 which is in kitkat also at 444 points 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.940
 4.2 and use the snapdragon that 801 we enter 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.880
 to the application of benchmarks leave it 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.220
 tutu and let's do a quick demo of 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.590
 what is this application to see the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.810
 final score and what has changed in both 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.480
 processors we give what is a bit the 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.270
 camera to deploy faster to what 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.520
 which is the result remembering that the 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.890
 800 snapdragon that was using elche 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.640
 the next generation processor in the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.140
 year 2013 and now which contracted the s80 1 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.300
 puts is a little faster and more 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.890
 efficient with the battery this more 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.250
 forward let's make a comparison 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.740
 between both terminals to investigate more 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.690
 thoroughly what differences there are while 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.760
 both in benchmark the difference is 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:24.520
 Abysmal is very big even though 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.560
 both run at the same speed 2.2 36 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.900
 gigahertz runs one and the other runs 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:35.390
 same while the result of 36 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:39.890
 thousand 369 for 801 and 31 thousand 660 for the 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:42.590
 s 800 although this was an improvement to pass 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.690
 the lens to kit kat as for the 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.369
 ventures have lowered their performance 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.050
 when I was in arrived and came a lot 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.940
 faster 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.710
 this has been all for today if it has 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.960
 liked the video give us a like no
