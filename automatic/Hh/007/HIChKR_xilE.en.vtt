00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.999

 uncharted has finally been ported to 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:31.380
 until you know I did not believe it myself I fell and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.020
 literally lying around just now 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.350

 you can match a man with a smart look like 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:11.759
 as if it's not a game of its own 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.610
 but there in this the best matches and light 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.290
 fantasy 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.900
 our main character is so drake 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.210
 fucking tough guy real lara 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.909

 Teng is interested in TERIN games and its 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.259
 don't even bother a girlfriend who doesn't 

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:39.360
 only wants to erase all nishtyaki themselves but 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.430
 and for some reason waving his arms like her 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.649
 nervous tick or something like that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:49.770
 she probably played too much 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:52.380
 shooters on the gamepad on the way to the award 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:54.869
 our drake will not stop anything he 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.570
 ease and monkey agility climbs on 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.909
 any concessions tops with cold blood 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.579
 Iguana walks on the edge of the bottomless 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:05.039
 the abyss with the speed of a tiger overcomes 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.020
 deadly trap of grace 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:10.289
 bat use their 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.870
 acrobatic skills even ezio altair 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.849

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.610
 to get an autograph from the robber 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:18.550
 tombs number one with the same ease 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.830
 our guy is just 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.830
 right any tasks and puzzles to find 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.200
 mechanisms to open the door is too easy 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.120
 you only need to press one arrow on 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.670
 gamepad and you will not only show 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.680
 picture where the subject lies but will explain 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.200
 how to get there really 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:37.570
 I began to respect the console players because they 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.150
 need to digest so much information for 1 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:43.270
 but also push the buttons here 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.430
 this is what I call a real hardcore 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.470
 melee drake has no equal 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.960
 you just look at these honed 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.270
 professional moves and clear punches 

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.910
 the sun area to your eye can 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:57.580
 it seems that the animation is slightly jerky 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.340
 but actually the hero is just so fast 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:03.160
 and just beats that the eye just does not have time 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.860
 notice the moment of hand movement seriously 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:08.260
 cps it's okay just this is secret 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.600
 tactic strike that you don't even 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.240
 noticed from the drake just wrote you 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.610
 bream by the way developers ancharted 

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.220
 naughty dog â€‹â€‹very seriously approached 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.650
 port and adaptation game for the peak of the homeless and 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.970
 tried to preserve the spirit and 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.640
 original atmosphere 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.610
 I ask you to pay attention to this 

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.739
 gorgeous texture she is not great 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.650
 is it really just a little piece 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.290
 land and how much soul is invested in it 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.290
 look at her and she looks at you and 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.630
 you understand that ancharted him not to be confused 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:43.450
 with nothing but when enemies becomes 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:46.150
 too many tomb raiders we would 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.920
 Rusa's bath grabs his gun or 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:50.500
 any other firearm 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:53.530
 which falls under the arm and distributes 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:56.020
 headshots every thugs singing while 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.050
 famous console megahit on 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.930
 gamepad everything is convenient on the gamepad everything 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:04.100
 conveniently 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:09.410
 aim and kill 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:13.280
 and I'll tell you exactly from the ceiling conveniently 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:15.470
 but if the enemies 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.600
 very very very very much so much 

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.030
 so there are not enough rounds in 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.000
 in this case, the drake uses stealth 

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:25.820
 with a quiet mouse a clear falcon he sneaks 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.870
 to the rear of the enemy and turns the neck one 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.870
 powerful grip 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.930
 is he out there besides this superhero 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:49.540
 drake perfectly controlled with every kind 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:50.740
 for example drives a car here 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.200
 true quad bike 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.750
 he is no longer able to do so he is always with 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.850
 a on such cases takes a woman and 

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:00.400
 puts her behind the wheel only you no one 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:03.400
 tell it a secret and most importantly remember 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.130
 that ancharted is the best grafon 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.650
 choosing uncharted you choose the best 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:10.870
 grafon compared to him battlefield 4 

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.870
 looks like chicken sks vitali 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.310
 incredibly detailed models 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.710
 divinely blurred textures and you don't 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:20.380

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.420
 look at the head of the main character and she 

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:29.680
 square just like in real life 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:31.990

 earlier, itâ€™s not like ancharted meaning 

00:06:24.389 --> 00:06:28.830
 but if you look closely, it says 

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:31.039
 slightly different words and it generally 

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.870
