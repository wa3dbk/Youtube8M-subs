I can't pause the video anytime I need
to<00:00:30.000> and<00:00:30.240> then<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:30.869> play<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:32.040> playing<00:00:32.250> whatever

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
to and then we play it playing whatever

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.910 
to and then we play it playing whatever
you<00:00:32.700> need<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.030> do<00:00:33.149> it<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.750> for<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.200> power

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
you need to do it so for me the power

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.340 
you need to do it so for me the power
tap<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.340> very<00:00:35.579> consistent<00:00:35.969> as<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.809> stages

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
tap is very consistent as is the stages

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.950 
tap is very consistent as is the stages
power<00:00:38.309> tap<00:00:38.489> generally<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.850> few<00:00:39.000> less<00:00:39.180> wattages

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
power tap generally a few less wattages

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.840 
power tap generally a few less wattages
and<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.829> stage<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.250> generally<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> little<00:00:41.670> bit

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
and the stage is generally a little bit

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510 
and the stage is generally a little bit
more<00:00:42.170> but<00:00:43.170> again<00:00:43.469> the<00:00:43.920> most<00:00:44.070> important<00:00:44.399> thing

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
more but again the most important thing

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
more but again the most important thing
for<00:00:44.610> me<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.940> consistency<00:00:45.690> when<00:00:46.050> I'm<00:00:46.170> actually

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
for me is consistency when I'm actually

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.560 
for me is consistency when I'm actually
pacing<00:00:46.980> on<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.160> client<00:00:47.640> that's<00:00:48.030> what<00:00:48.300> matters

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
pacing on the client that's what matters

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.720 
pacing on the client that's what matters
the<00:00:48.690> most<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.440> power<00:00:49.649> tap<00:00:49.920> lets<00:00:50.430> you<00:00:50.550> pace

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
the most the power tap lets you pace

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.819 
the most the power tap lets you pace
properly<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:51.329> so<00:00:51.780> does<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.050> stages<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.710> me

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
properly and so does the stages for me

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:54.799 
properly and so does the stages for me
they're<00:00:53.010> equal<00:00:53.399> when<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.879> comes<00:00:54.059> to<00:00:54.210> pacing<00:00:54.660> on

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
they're equal when it comes to pacing on

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.529 
they're equal when it comes to pacing on
a<00:00:55.079> client<00:00:55.530> both<00:00:56.340> screws<00:00:56.730> each<00:00:56.879> other<00:00:57.030> okay<00:00:57.510> I

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
a client both screws each other okay I

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.200 
a client both screws each other okay I
quit<00:00:58.170> talking<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.059> you<00:01:00.059> can<00:01:00.180> just

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
quit talking now and you can just

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
quit talking now and you can just
compare<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.719> data<00:01:00.899> post<00:01:01.590> comments<00:01:01.920> down

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
compare the data post comments down

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:11.550 
compare the data post comments down
below<00:01:02.160> see<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:02.910> soon

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560
