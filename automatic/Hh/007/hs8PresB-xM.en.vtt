I should show you what the rainbows do
when<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.180> feed<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.570> they're<00:00:22.560> kind<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.800> loud

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
when I feed them they're kind of loud

when I feed them they're kind of loud
there's<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.750> substrate<00:00:25.350> you<00:00:25.380> guys<00:00:25.710> get

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
there's the the substrate you guys get

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.620 
there's the the substrate you guys get
an<00:00:26.070> idea<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.460> how<00:00:26.609> thick<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.880> is

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
an idea of how thick that is

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.830 
an idea of how thick that is
and<00:00:28.170> that's<00:00:28.970> actually<00:00:29.970> worse<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> thinnest

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and that's actually worse the thinnest

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.270 
and that's actually worse the thinnest
but<00:00:31.230> you<00:00:31.410> get<00:00:31.679> a<00:00:31.710> some<00:00:32.640> lights<00:00:32.850> hitting<00:00:33.059> that

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
but you get a some lights hitting that

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.250 
but you get a some lights hitting that
you<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:35.460> see<00:00:35.670> that's<00:00:35.850> organic<00:00:36.239> dirt<00:00:36.660> it's

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
blue Rams have spawned again they laid

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.560 
blue Rams have spawned again they laid
eggs<00:02:18.770> over<00:02:19.770> in<00:02:20.100> this<00:02:20.520> little<00:02:20.850> corner<00:02:21.450> right

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
eggs over in this little corner right

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.240 
eggs over in this little corner right
here<00:02:21.750> and<00:02:23.570> you<00:02:24.570> can<00:02:24.720> see<00:02:24.960> a<00:02:24.990> few<00:02:25.380> stuck<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.130> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
here and you can see a few stuck to the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.790 
here and you can see a few stuck to the
filter<00:02:26.700> because<00:02:27.600> he's<00:02:27.780> picked<00:02:28.500> them<00:02:28.620> up<00:02:28.709> and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
filter because he's picked them up and

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.300 
filter because he's picked them up and
spit<00:02:28.920> them<00:02:29.040> out<00:02:29.250> and<00:02:30.350> I<00:02:31.350> don't<00:02:31.800> I<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.100> don't

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.830 
spit them out and I don't I just don't
think<00:02:32.580> that<00:02:32.640> they<00:02:33.740> did<00:02:34.740> any<00:02:34.890> of<00:02:34.980> them<00:02:35.190> hashed

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
think that they did any of them hashed
