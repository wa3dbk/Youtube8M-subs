00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.350
 do not 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.240
 the experience of having gÃ¡dor and xalpa 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.059
 of the frozen movie was a 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.160
 new experience for me because it was not 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.710
 a theme for violet or something that has 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.530
 what to see with violet that was all this 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.160
 time for him 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:30.220
 It was great to stop being for a 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.330
 second the violet character and be able to be 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.150
 I can sing with my things with my 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.430
 personality and not have to be 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.050
 always in the skin of people who live 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.300
 here without being in the skin of another 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 character and playing with that was 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.220
 terrific I also had the opportunity to 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.350
 sing in Italian and in the study of 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.390

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.860
 time and I recorded the subject in Italian 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.610

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.370

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:02.840

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:10.270

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.270
 things would be great 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.040
 yes 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.670
 Y 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.670
 I am very enamored 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.070
 what does not matter of 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.650
 the person that I fell in love with is more than 

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:31.650
 nothing is his personality and that is 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:35.100
 partner with me and want me to 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.480
 true so I am those things are what 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.060
 that I care about a person 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.040
 and I love falling in love 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.090
 feel 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.090
 and the truth that yes 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.060
 and have been chosen to sing the 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:57.740
 free song are disguised in a pride 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.370
 very big for me it was also a 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:03.950
 challenge because when I was little 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.530
 heard the princesses singing the 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.350
 Disney songs and one sometimes 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.660
 feel identified with the issues that 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:13.880
 the princesses sing the message that 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.970
 transmit when when they sing each 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.489
 song and I had had the opportunity 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.220
 and the responsibility to convey that 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.650
 message to all the children of the world that 

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.230
 come to watch this movie and that 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.000
 listen to the topic 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:33.380
 It's amazing to send a message 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.570
 to children who watch the movie and who 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:38.380
 listen to the song and listen to me 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.540
 voice and that you can feel identified 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:43.970
 that's the cutest thing and it was the cutest 

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:47.009
 have recorded that theme for the people 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:50.460
 because one works for people 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:53.369
 and the truth is that it is feeling the 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.249
 responsibility and the honor of transmitting 

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:59.029
 a message to all the people who read me and 

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:59.029
 listen to the song 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.990
 i 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.990
 the universe
