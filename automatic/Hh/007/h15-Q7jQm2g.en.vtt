00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.260
 he should go through here and come to one 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.960
 another black ops 2 video of me here 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.020
 on the title german channel yes for the first time 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.449
 I want myself for my last black ops 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.130
 2 video apologize and that was 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.350
 without a comment 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.660
 and that does not have the reason now 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:27.390
 I was just too lazy now 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.910
 to comment on the gameplay but that was 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.470
 a little adversity from me of that 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.110
 I hope that it does not happen again 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.210
 and indeed there is one after the man 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.309
 comments made two files that 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.550
 one is the calm gameplay here and that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:45.930
 others is the annotated gmp file like that 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:47.309
 since I delete the gameplay files first 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.559
 after reading the comment already 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.010
 uploaded and the comments 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.719
 keep files as a backup on my 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.559
 hard disk that they are big enough anyway 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.690
 I just confused that 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.039
 unfortunately and I thought the comments 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.850
 to have uploaded a file 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.140
 in truth what the gmbh is so now 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.869
 the comments are still on 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 my hard drive but that's what you have 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.360
 you have already seen and the comment on it 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.460
 she does not need her anymore 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.830
 However, that's why there is now one 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.049
 new gameplay and this time with counter 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.689
 and indeed it is here a free for all 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.939
 I played on the map meltdown 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.470
 that with the pbb 57 with the biotech 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:27.780
 visor plus a silencer 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.030
 and my killstreaks were the drone 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.640
 the brightest rocket I have here now 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.409
 also already played freely and as 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.210
 I still had the third killstreak 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.320
 helicopter I really only 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.880
 recommend can therefore because actually makes 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:42.840
 always tidy kills now and then there's 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.030
 he does not manage to complete that many 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.810
 but actually he always does that six 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.790
 to eight kills and there the killstreak even 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.110
 not even that high you get them 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.460
 I also think so quickly 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.049
 Unfortunately, I do not remember now 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.240
 heart in the earlier cds could 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.729
 you just remember it 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.619
 how many kills do you need? 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.869
 to get crate now it's with 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:06.180
 Points that means you have one fair 

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:08.879
 if you get points or you generally apply 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.289
 If you get points you destroy something 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.030
 you also know what a point 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.560
 you also have to believe in finding one 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.750
 I find points assist point 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.270
 and all that adds up and so on 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.830
 you get the kills 6 will of course 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.480
 what has remained the same when you die 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.050
 the points are gone 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.660
 as already said that is here 

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.209
 on the map meltdown &amp; mather and is 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.040
 one of the maps that I like a little more 

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:34.650
 So that's one of my favorite maps 

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:39.750
 next to plaza especially a few for all 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.670
 once clear that this is the 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:44.099
 luxury area where a few people live 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.480
 somewhere in the hollywood hill or 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.549
 beverly hills or wherever that 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.860
 should be and then I still like 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:53.400
 pretty good hijack that's a bit 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.370
 chaotic because the map is actually very 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.230
 small is so slightly larger than new 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.880
 For example, Dawn could theoretically 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:06.299
 even say it is new town on the sea 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:08.870
 new dawn on a yacht because of this 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.000
 both very small but relatively chaotic 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.560
 that would have been the good lingering though 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.670
 to him for all this while little 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:19.320
 points and also in the team 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.329
 you can actually do that with deathmatch 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.950
 play relatively tactically and then come 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:25.430
 even if i get pretty good out of here 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.959
 about ye have recently now a 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:28.980
 hostie, so to speak 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:29.910
 I did not see her after that 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.560
 was balanced 

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.620
 but I have another person 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:36.450
 That was because after home with which came 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.430
 then a new file in the cinema mode that 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:39.900
 means I had time machine issue 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.569
 and in between there are around 0 5 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.459
 lost seconds as well 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:46.590
 always be the gameplay and it worked 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:48.870
 I still do not know if I was then 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.090
 to the house because then there is no 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:53.609
 I'm out of trouble 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:57.150
 So I have a little bit about the maps 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:59.459
 talked about the about the gameplay me 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:03.209
 here too, I simply use the 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:05.790
 remaining time for a first upshot to 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:09.359
 black ops 2 on this channel here because 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:10.950
 in the last video I have him playing 

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:12.840
 that gives and as I said it was unfortunately 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:15.359
 no comment but even if you do that 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:18.329
 commentary would have that I have on 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:20.430
 release tag added 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:23.070
 from there was then no opinion 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.229
 in it and I could just say now 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.570
 What I like about black ops 2 and what 

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:28.820
 Not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:33.230
 So let's start with the positive 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:35.630
 I think that things are positive 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.460
 There are a relatively large number of maps that I find 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.960
 positive 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.370
 i like the weapons i really like them 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.530
 I found an example in black ops 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.970
 There were just too few weapons that fun 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:45.830
 there was an eye 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:52.520
 that was super double magazine especially 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:55.160
 there were ak-47 there were farmers and 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.320
 ok many made the ak and I to 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.590
 example brought the l 6 90 1 because I 

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.390
 like sniper but in principle is 56 60 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.030
 Weapons that's it 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:07.550
 and in mw2 for example i was there 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:09.920
 really made 15 weapons and even the 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:11.630
 Secondary weapons made so whether now 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.100
 magnum or fun 12 they were everything 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:14.600
 great and so I find is back in 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.550
 black ops are again really many 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:19.750
 Weapons always fell and I think so 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.430
 also positive so the web design 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.050
 I also like pretty much because im 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:28.040
 black ops 1 the game was pretty 

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:29.900
 boring and in black ops in mw3 was 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.210
 the design of the webspace but me 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:33.380
 the maps did not really like anything 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:34.250
 so i could connect with mp3 at all 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.350
 do not start 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.820
 I liked the web server I found 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.380
 she plays us because I do not know me 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.570
 I do not know why but I like it 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:43.520
 that does not exist in black ops 2 at all 

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:45.680
 There are already more maps that I like 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.360
 and even now she does not see mine 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:49.070
 Favorite apps belong to me now 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.020
 not necessarily so I think there is 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.760
 a map and not me now 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.240
 she thinks like her name is like me 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:58.750
 that absolutely bothers me is somewhere 

00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:00.740
 huge military runway or something 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.550
 I do not like it but otherwise 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.170
 I finally have no problem with it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:07.670
 and another positive point are the 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.290
 killstreaks so there is really a lot 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:10.540
 many killstreaks and it is for everyone 

00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:15.890
 something here 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:19.040
 For example, I think that the board is negative 

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:21.590
 system is still not very good is the 

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.180
 makes some mistakes so I stand behind 

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:24.950
 Just free the pound from me 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:26.300
 for all and that really is not 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.980
 many people only eight people in the club 

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.430
 Do not let something like that happen 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.320
 a normal sized web and negative 

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.300
 For example , I still think that the 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:38.600
 equipment and tick become too strong 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:39.480
 This is the reason for camping 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.500
 easier 

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:44.730
 So camper have it easier 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.150
 scary fast also explode the 

00:06:44.730 --> 00:06:49.530
 clément are back and the 

00:06:47.150 --> 00:06:51.480
 Electric shock charge this very much 

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:53.730
 strong but otherwise I like that 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:56.040
 play pretty well better than mp3 and 

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:58.620
 by design I just find it 

00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:00.360
 long so it is slowly motivating 

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:03.540
 as a backoffice 1 at least I go 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:06.660
 from that and therefore I do not see any 

00:07:03.540 --> 00:07:07.860
 the game the list two three 

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.510
 months not to gamble 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:11.670
 yes I hope that is possible who has you 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:12.690
 he likes his 30 to 4 too 

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:13.710
 on my private post 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:15.060
 drop by and I would go over 

00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:17.630
 one rating look forward to the next 

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:17.630
