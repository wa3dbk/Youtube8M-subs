I think that they should make a better a

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.179 
I think that they should make a better a
higher<00:01:21.310> quality<00:01:21.939> shooter<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:23.680> also<00:01:24.070> they

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
last a little bit longer because nobody

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.870 
last a little bit longer because nobody
