music and just a whole movement how we
weird<00:02:26.889> thing<00:02:27.450> advanced<00:02:28.450> I<00:02:28.630> mean<00:02:28.930> if<00:02:29.049> he<00:02:29.139> says

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
weird thing advanced I mean if he says

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740 
weird thing advanced I mean if he says
it's<00:02:29.709> crazy<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.970> see<00:02:31.150> didn't<00:02:31.329> pick<00:02:31.480> it<00:02:31.630> up

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
I guess as a compliment while the NBA's

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.740 
I guess as a compliment while the NBA's
presence<00:02:36.040> in<00:02:36.160> China<00:02:36.489> was<00:02:36.760> big<00:02:37.030> for<00:02:37.600> this

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
presence in China was big for this

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.960 
presence in China was big for this
