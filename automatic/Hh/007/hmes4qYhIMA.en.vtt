00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.940 
down I didn't want to take the cardboard
out<00:02:04.959> of<00:02:04.989> them<00:02:05.139> if<00:02:05.289> you<00:02:05.439> take<00:02:05.560> the<00:02:05.679> cardboard

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:05.950 
out of them if you take the cardboard

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.349 
out of them if you take the cardboard
out<00:02:06.159> you<00:02:06.249> probably<00:02:06.399> can<00:02:06.700> get<00:02:06.849> a<00:02:06.880> couple<00:02:07.209> more

space<00:02:58.159> so<00:02:58.400> I<00:02:58.430> figured<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.909> would<00:02:58.939> stick<00:02:59.359> some<00:02:59.569> in

00:02:59.589 --> 00:02:59.599 
space so I figured I would stick some in

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.770 
space so I figured I would stick some in
a<00:03:00.019> couple<00:03:00.889> five-gallon<00:03:01.430> buckets<00:03:01.819> to<00:03:02.090> make

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
a couple five-gallon buckets to make

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.780 
always recommend stocking up on paper
products<00:03:11.719> because<00:03:12.169> they're<00:03:12.980> great<00:03:13.219> bartering

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
products because they're great bartering

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.349

tools<00:03:14.090> and<00:03:14.889> they<00:03:15.889> don't<00:03:16.129> ever<00:03:16.489> go<00:03:16.879> bad<00:03:17.090> if

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
tools and they don't ever go bad if

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.550

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
forever I mean they may disintegrate a

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.449 
forever I mean they may disintegrate a
little<00:03:24.019> bit<00:03:24.199> they<00:03:24.470> may<00:03:24.620> not<00:03:24.799> be<00:03:24.949> as<00:03:25.069> thick<00:03:25.280> as

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
little bit they may not be as thick as

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.159
