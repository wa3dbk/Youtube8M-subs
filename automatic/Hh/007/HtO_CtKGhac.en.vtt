00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.770
 guess why we are here Renault cars 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.310
 sandero stepway 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:34.030
 already familiar and tests and about 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.930
 passed six months ago in Greece already in 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.390
 Belarus 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.570
 we tested made a feminine look 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:43.390
 this little car but it is here in 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.260

 north sea premiere new 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.629
 automatic boxes yes yes and early foot or 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:59.070
 as they call us in the expanses of the cis 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.629
 stepashka and logan and sandero 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.789
 waited waited for automatic boxes 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:07.659
 gears so here we have on the test 

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:11.230
 two options at once the first option is 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:13.120
 Automatic robotic box if r 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.310
 and the second box is classic 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.420
 automatic four - stage well 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.460
 familiar to us by the first generation 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.780
 Engineers say it was finalized. 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:26.790
 brought to mind so that's why it is in 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:30.670
 Holland and because here it is so windy 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.860
 bite not because there is a solid channel 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.119
 and small half paths where you can 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:39.250
 feel the work and robotic 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.439
 automat and classic auto moto wind 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.079
 just blows out and blows me away we we still 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.890
 not on the coast of the northern sea but because 

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:49.270
 what is holland 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.229
 this country is two wheels yes yes country 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.789
 bicycle 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.689
 we are waiting for a bike tour 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.689
 in amsterdam 

00:01:55.689 --> 00:02:01.479
 about 1 on 2 pedals that is pedals 

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.049
 brakes and gas, we check how to lead 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.479
 myself 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:08.340
 robotic automatic and classic 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.340
 automatic machine on the road of holland 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.319
 I 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.160
 Nicholas 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:14.069
 you 

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.090
 Michael 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:31.909
 the figures do not argue as much as I did not like 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.629
 automatic transmission 

00:05:31.909 --> 00:05:37.349
 petrol consumption per robot for a hundred 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.620
 kilometers 

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:43.620
 I reduced by a hundred more than a liter 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.099
 to be exact one whole 2 tenths 

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:50.189
 liters and on the machine directly to them with my 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:52.639
 driving style with that here on 

00:05:50.189 --> 00:05:55.500
 dutch roads all the time 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:58.949
 start gas slow down here we are 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.509
 again now we rush to the traffic light flow 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.569
 fuel of course on the machine 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:08.779
 increased so who wants to save 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.779
 Naturally it is worth thinking about the robot 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.010
 badge 

00:06:46.569 --> 00:06:48.569
