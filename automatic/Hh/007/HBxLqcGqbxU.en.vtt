00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.800 
soft plastic jerk bait on a 723 power
rod<00:02:52.040> the<00:02:52.430> reason<00:02:52.760> is<00:02:52.909> it<00:02:53.060> has<00:02:53.090> a<00:02:53.209> soft<00:02:53.569> and

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
rod the reason is it has a soft and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.629 
rod the reason is it has a soft and
forgiving<00:02:54.200> tip<00:02:54.409> which<00:02:54.980> will<00:02:55.010> give<00:02:55.280> the<00:02:55.430> bait

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:55.639 
forgiving tip which will give the bait

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:58.449 
forgiving tip which will give the bait
to<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:55.939> fish<00:02:56.209> and<00:02:56.859> it<00:02:57.859> gives<00:02:58.069> you<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.280> little

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
to the fish and it gives you a little

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:00.729 
to the fish and it gives you a little
bit<00:02:58.639> more<00:02:58.790> time<00:02:59.060> to<00:03:00.019> set<00:03:00.230> the<00:03:00.349> hook<00:03:00.439> on<00:03:00.590> and

bit more time to set the hook on and
