anything<00:02:12.240> is<00:02:12.440> you<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:14.570> think<00:02:15.570> the<00:02:15.780> Bible

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
anything is you know I think the Bible

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.130 
anything is you know I think the Bible
has<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.380> lot<00:02:16.710> to<00:02:16.890> do<00:02:17.040> with<00:02:17.070> their<00:02:17.400> first<00:02:17.730> way<00:02:18.140> but

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
has a lot to do with their first way but

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.720 
has a lot to do with their first way but
in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.410> Bible<00:02:19.740> there's<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:20.040> lot<00:02:20.220> of<00:02:20.250> violence

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
in the Bible there's a lot of violence

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
in the Bible there's a lot of violence
in<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.240> Bible<00:02:21.630> also<00:02:21.840> i<00:02:22.380> mean<00:02:22.920> there's<00:02:23.190> worse

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
in the Bible also i mean there's worse

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.020 
in the Bible also i mean there's worse
over<00:02:23.820> religion<00:02:24.360> all<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:24.630> time<00:02:24.840> but<00:02:25.140> it<00:02:25.260> is

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
over religion all the time but it is

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.120 
over religion all the time but it is
yeah<00:02:27.030> i<00:02:27.060> don't<00:02:27.570> think<00:02:27.900> i<00:02:27.959> was<00:02:28.140> against<00:02:28.950> the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
yeah i don't think i was against the

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.770 
yeah i don't think i was against the
bible<00:02:29.310> or<00:02:29.580> anything<00:02:29.760> like<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:29.910> but<00:02:30.330> he<00:02:30.570> is

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
bible or anything like that but he is

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.890

the way I think in the second half of

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.330 
the way I think in the second half of
the<00:03:09.330> fight<00:03:09.510> he<00:03:09.660> shot<00:03:09.870> box<00:03:10.140> it<00:03:10.350> more<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:10.980> learn

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
the fight he shot box it more and learn

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.039 
the fight he shot box it more and learn
that<00:03:11.370> is<00:03:11.640> better<00:03:11.820> to<00:03:12.030> box<00:03:12.239> many<00:03:12.540> them<00:03:12.900> to

00:03:13.039 --> 00:03:13.049 
that is better to box many them to

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:15.140 
that is better to box many them to
exchange<00:03:13.440> with<00:03:13.680> him<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.100> then<00:03:14.820> with

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
exchange with him and then with

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.759 
exchange with him and then with
marquette<00:03:15.630> incite<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:16.019> way<00:03:16.140> he<00:03:16.290> fought<00:03:16.470> him

as<00:03:17.340> those<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:18.709> pink<00:03:19.709> box<00:03:20.130> very<00:03:20.430> well<00:03:20.670> and<00:03:20.820> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
as those of pink box very well and I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.370 
as those of pink box very well and I
think<00:03:21.000> that's<00:03:21.360> always<00:03:21.600> been<00:03:21.750> doing<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.140> that

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
think that's always been doing this that

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.289 
think that's always been doing this that
he's<00:03:22.470> gonna<00:03:22.590> moving<00:03:22.860> box<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.340> little<00:03:23.370> bit<00:03:23.640> and

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
he's gonna moving box a little bit and

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:25.580 
he's gonna moving box a little bit and
we're<00:03:24.480> gonna<00:03:24.600> have<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.900> cut<00:03:25.049> the<00:03:25.170> ring<00:03:25.320> off<00:03:25.470> and

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
we're gonna have to cut the ring off and

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.930 
we're gonna have to cut the ring off and
be<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.769> little<00:03:25.920> bit<00:03:26.130> more<00:03:26.310> aggressive<00:03:26.400> and

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
be a little bit more aggressive and

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.840 
be a little bit more aggressive and
that's<00:03:27.750> type<00:03:28.049> of<00:03:28.200> stimulating<00:03:29.040> but<00:03:29.459> once<00:03:29.700> we

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
that's type of stimulating but once we

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.460 
that's type of stimulating but once we
started<00:03:29.880> cutting<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.480> ring<00:03:30.630> off<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:30.840> forcing

the workout that you have and now

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.220 
the workout that you have and now

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.949 
in last fight I'm endowment a to retire
and<00:04:03.739> they<00:04:04.400> told<00:04:04.760> me<00:04:04.910> no<00:04:05.090> problem<00:04:05.569> and<00:04:05.840> I

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:05.959 
and they told me no problem and I

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.490 
and they told me no problem and I
haven't<00:04:06.319> seen<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:06.560> so<00:04:07.010> he<00:04:07.190> he<00:04:07.640> he<00:04:08.510> sold<00:04:08.870> his

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:09.500 
haven't seen that so he he he sold his

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.070 
haven't seen that so he he he sold his
great<00:04:09.800> work<00:04:09.950> ethic<00:04:10.220> he<00:04:10.640> he's<00:04:11.360> getting<00:04:11.540> older

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
great work ethic he he's getting older

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:13.960 
great work ethic he he's getting older
of<00:04:12.230> course<00:04:12.260> so<00:04:12.769> I<00:04:12.800> think<00:04:13.040> it's<00:04:13.310> naturally<00:04:13.819> he

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:13.970 
of course so I think it's naturally he

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:15.309 
of course so I think it's naturally he
slowed<00:04:14.150> down<00:04:14.300> a<00:04:14.360> little<00:04:14.569> bit<00:04:14.840> here<00:04:15.110> and<00:04:15.230> there

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
slowed down a little bit here and there

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:19.390 
slowed down a little bit here and there
