so<00:00:07.649> here<00:00:07.770> we<00:00:07.859> are<00:00:07.890> back<00:00:08.010> again<00:00:08.250> then<00:00:08.610> and<00:00:09.200> the

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
so here we are back again then and the

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.660 
so here we are back again then and the
only<00:00:10.320> difference<00:00:10.469> this<00:00:10.830> time<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.309> I've

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
only difference this time is I've

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.140 
only difference this time is I've
connected<00:00:11.969> my<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:13.429> took<00:00:14.429> up<00:00:14.549> to<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.730> seven

you<00:00:30.689> can<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:31.050> on<00:00:31.170> the<00:00:31.260> video<00:00:31.399> but<00:00:32.399> you'll

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
you can see on the video but you'll

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.229 
you can see on the video but you'll
certainly<00:00:32.730> hear<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.239> is<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:34.370> rudder<00:00:35.370> servo<00:00:35.760> is

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
certainly hear it is the rudder servo is

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.319 
certainly hear it is the rudder servo is
hunting<00:00:36.870> like<00:00:37.020> crazy<00:00:37.399> far<00:00:38.399> more<00:00:38.760> than<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.149> did

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
hunting like crazy far more than it did

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.380 
hunting like crazy far more than it did
on<00:00:39.390> that<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:39.809> with<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.440> orange<00:00:40.739> receiver<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
on that we with the orange receiver and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.500 
on that we with the orange receiver and
in<00:00:42.510> fact<00:00:42.719> both<00:00:42.899> servos<00:00:43.469> elevator<00:00:44.070> and<00:00:44.460> rudder

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
in fact both servos elevator and rudder

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.940 
in fact both servos elevator and rudder
a<00:00:45.510> hunting<00:00:46.110> like<00:00:46.260> Madden<00:00:46.590> I'm<00:00:46.649> just<00:00:46.770> going<00:00:46.920> to

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
a hunting like Madden I'm just going to

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.529 
a hunting like Madden I'm just going to
move<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.250> microphone<00:00:47.550> down<00:00:47.879> there<00:00:48.059> again<00:00:48.149> so

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
move the microphone down there again so

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
move the microphone down there again so
you<00:00:48.600> get<00:00:48.809> an<00:00:49.020> idea<00:00:57.649> now<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.770> it's<00:00:58.890> quite

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
you get an idea now that it's quite

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.349 
you get an idea now that it's quite
disturbing<00:00:59.250> because<00:00:59.789> there's<00:00:59.940> there<00:01:00.239> is

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
disturbing because there's there is

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.860 
disturbing because there's there is
enough<00:01:00.629> movement<00:01:00.930> there<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:02.660> to<00:01:03.660> make<00:01:03.840> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
enough movement there now to make a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.600 
enough movement there now to make a
difference<00:01:04.320> at<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.500> control<00:01:04.920> surface<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
difference at the control surface so

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
difference at the control surface so
that<00:01:05.640> would<00:01:05.880> be<00:01:06.090> I<00:01:06.299> think<00:01:06.659> pretty<00:01:07.080> unstable

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
that would be I think pretty unstable

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.480 
that would be I think pretty unstable
I'm<00:01:07.860> just<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.130> to<00:01:08.159> move<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:10.280> move<00:01:11.280> the

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
I'm just going to move the move the

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.190 
I'm just going to move the move the
flights<00:01:11.760> they<00:01:11.939> rise<00:01:12.119> about<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.689> sort<00:01:13.140> of

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
flights they rise about to it's sort of

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.160 
flights they rise about to it's sort of
straight<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.619> level<00:01:13.799> position<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.790> like

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
straight and level position if you like

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.710 
straight and level position if you like
and<00:01:19.460> it's<00:01:20.460> still<00:01:20.700> there<00:01:20.909> so<00:01:21.270> it's<00:01:21.390> nothing<00:01:21.540> to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
and it's still there so it's nothing to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.030 
and it's still there so it's nothing to
do<00:01:21.840> with<00:01:21.900> directional<00:01:22.409> control<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.890> if<00:01:22.950> I

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
do with directional control and if I

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.289 
do with directional control and if I
move<00:01:23.220> these<00:01:23.369> things<00:01:23.610> around<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:24.150> does

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
move these things around it does

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.300 
move these things around it does
actually<00:01:24.600> still<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.830> it's<00:01:25.979> supposed<00:01:26.220> to

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
actually still do what it's supposed to

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.240 
actually still do what it's supposed to
but<00:01:26.430> there's<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.670> lot<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> movement<00:01:27.150> there

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
but there's a lot of movement there

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.140 
but there's a lot of movement there
particular<00:01:29.250> so<00:01:29.400> particularly<00:01:29.670> on<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> rudder

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
particular so particularly on the rudder

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.749 
particular so particularly on the rudder
now<00:01:30.810> something<00:01:31.740> else<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.070> probably<00:01:32.250> even<00:01:32.460> more

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
now something else is probably even more

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.240 
now something else is probably even more
disturbing<00:01:33.360> certainly<00:01:33.840> for<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.439> this

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
disturbing certainly for me is this

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.460 
disturbing certainly for me is this
watch<00:01:36.180> the<00:01:36.479> elevator<00:01:36.810> servo<00:01:37.650> as<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.820> move<00:01:39.060> it<00:01:39.240> up

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
watch the elevator servo as I move it up

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.819 
watch the elevator servo as I move it up
or<00:01:40.470> sorry<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> downward<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> morally

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
or sorry in the downward but morally

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.450 
or sorry in the downward but morally
through<00:01:44.640> its<00:01:44.790> full<00:01:44.939> range<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.990> clicks

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
through its full range it clicks

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.830 
through its full range it clicks
stutters<00:01:47.460> delays<00:01:48.030> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.570> see<00:01:48.720> they're

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
stutters delays you can see they're

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.030 
stutters delays you can see they're
happening<00:01:49.049> I'm<00:01:49.200> actually<00:01:49.320> moving<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.979> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
happening I'm actually moving the you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.359 
happening I'm actually moving the you
can't<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:50.579> it<00:01:50.700> I'm<00:01:51.149> moving<00:01:52.049> the<00:01:52.170> control<00:01:52.500> on

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
can't see it I'm moving the control on

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.569 
can't see it I'm moving the control on
the<00:01:53.430> transmitter<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.270> smoothly<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:55.579> both

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
the transmitter very smoothly from both

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.030 
the transmitter very smoothly from both
extensors<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.329> travel<00:01:57.719> but<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.619> servo<00:01:59.009> is

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
extensors to travel but the servo is

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.170 
extensors to travel but the servo is
kicking<00:01:59.520> right<00:01:59.670> mad

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.309 

that's<00:02:04.180> what<00:02:04.329> I<00:02:04.360> mean<00:02:05.219> not<00:02:06.219> very<00:02:06.340> good<00:02:06.460> at<00:02:06.700> all

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:07.319 
that's what I mean not very good at all

00:02:07.319 --> 00:02:10.350 
that's what I mean not very good at all
now<00:02:08.319> I'm<00:02:08.410> not<00:02:08.530> going<00:02:08.649> to<00:02:08.769> do<00:02:08.890> it<00:02:08.920> on<00:02:09.160> tape<00:02:10.090> here

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
now I'm not going to do it on tape here

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.300 
now I'm not going to do it on tape here
but<00:02:10.569> I<00:02:10.599> can<00:02:10.780> assure<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.019> I<00:02:11.349> have<00:02:11.950> tried<00:02:12.280> a

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
but I can assure you I have tried a

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.650 
but I can assure you I have tried a
different<00:02:12.700> server<00:02:13.000> I've<00:02:13.239> swapped<00:02:13.540> the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.660 
different server I've swapped the

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.390 
different server I've swapped the
channels<00:02:13.989> around<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:14.890> it<00:02:15.010> is<00:02:15.129> definitely

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
channels around and it is definitely

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.800 
channels around and it is definitely
something<00:02:15.700> coming<00:02:16.300> out<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.510> the<00:02:16.629> flight

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
stabilizer box in circuit everything is

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.220 
stabilizer box in circuit everything is
nice<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.459> smooth<00:02:21.819> and<00:02:22.269> as<00:02:22.599> it<00:02:22.720> should<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:23.050> so

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
nice and smooth and as it should be so

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:25.410 
nice and smooth and as it should be so
there's<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.470> definite<00:02:23.980> issue<00:02:24.130> there<00:02:24.580> I<00:02:24.790> would

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
there's a definite issue there I would

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:28.339 
there's a definite issue there I would
say<00:02:25.450> cross<00:02:26.110> compatibility<00:02:26.950> with<00:02:27.250> various

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
say cross compatibility with various

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.620 
say cross compatibility with various
radio<00:02:29.349> systems<00:02:29.860> and<00:02:30.069> by<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.220> way<00:02:30.430> off<00:02:31.330> air<00:02:31.599> I

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
radio systems and by the way off air I

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.500 
radio systems and by the way off air I
have<00:02:31.959> tried<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.459> tune<00:02:33.459> that<00:02:33.700> movement<00:02:34.180> out<00:02:34.330> in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
have tried to tune that movement out in

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.120 
have tried to tune that movement out in
various<00:02:34.840> ways<00:02:35.080> but<00:02:35.319> it's<00:02:35.440> impossible<00:02:35.709> it

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
various ways but it's impossible it

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.370 
various ways but it's impossible it
always<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:37.239> always<00:02:37.390> there<00:02:37.780> and<00:02:37.959> it's<00:02:38.170> always

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
always is always there and it's always

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:47.699 
always is always there and it's always
random<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:41.319> definitely<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.220> problem<00:02:42.640> there<00:02:46.709> in

00:02:47.699 --> 00:02:47.709 
random so definitely a problem there in

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:49.949 
random so definitely a problem there in

server I'm taking a bit of a risk if I

00:02:59.769 --> 00:03:01.170 
server I'm taking a bit of a risk if I
just<00:02:59.950> grabbed<00:03:00.190> it<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.400> of<00:03:00.459> the<00:03:00.579> spares<00:03:00.880> box

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
just grabbed it out of the spares box

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.559 
just grabbed it out of the spares box
but<00:03:01.989> we<00:03:02.079> go<00:03:02.170> out<00:03:02.319> try<00:03:02.560> changing<00:03:03.060> this<00:03:04.060> servo

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
but we go out try changing this servo

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.710 
but we go out try changing this servo

Futaba type socket on it what do we got

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:26.009 
Futaba type socket on it what do we got
here<00:03:20.980> then<00:03:21.720> stay<00:03:22.720> with<00:03:22.930> me<00:03:24.660> okay<00:03:25.660> let's<00:03:25.810> try

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
here then stay with me okay let's try

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:41.300 
here then stay with me okay let's try
this<00:03:26.139> one

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.720 

and<00:03:42.310> you'll<00:03:42.550> see<00:03:43.770> different<00:03:44.770> servers<00:03:45.490> still

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
and you'll see different servers still

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.320 
and you'll see different servers still
kicking<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.920> messing<00:03:47.920> around<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:49.120> crazy

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 
kicking and messing around like crazy

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:51.750 
kicking and messing around like crazy
now<00:03:49.600> I'll<00:03:50.410> say<00:03:50.590> this<00:03:50.800> is<00:03:50.980> these<00:03:51.250> are<00:03:51.490> actually

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
now I'll say this is these are actually

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.050 
now I'll say this is these are actually
digital<00:03:52.720> servos<00:03:53.200> I'm<00:03:53.470> gonna<00:03:53.710> try<00:03:53.980> a<00:03:54.220> non

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
digital servos I'm gonna try a non

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.670 
digital servos I'm gonna try a non
digital<00:03:55.300> if<00:03:55.750> you<00:03:55.810> just<00:03:55.930> bear<00:03:56.140> with<00:03:56.200> me<00:03:56.380> for<00:03:56.620> a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
digital if you just bear with me for a

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.780 
digital if you just bear with me for a
moment<00:03:57.120> unplug<00:03:58.120> this<00:03:58.330> one<00:03:58.600> and<00:03:59.550> if<00:04:00.550> I<00:04:00.610> can

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
moment unplug this one and if I can

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.720 
moment unplug this one and if I can
reach<00:04:01.210> over<00:04:01.600> to<00:04:01.750> the<00:04:02.250> other<00:04:03.250> side<00:04:03.550> of<00:04:03.670> the

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
reach over to the other side of the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.850 
reach over to the other side of the
workshop<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:06.340> find<00:04:06.610> one<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.760> these<00:04:06.880> high-tech

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:07.860 
workshop and find one of these high-tech

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:17.360 
workshop and find one of these high-tech
there<00:04:08.860> were<00:04:08.980> these<00:04:09.130> five<00:04:09.490> four<00:04:09.760> eight<00:04:09.790> five

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.880 

okay<00:04:18.370> you<00:04:18.430> see<00:04:18.820> they<00:04:18.970> still<00:04:19.680> actually<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.739> can

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
okay you see they still actually you can

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:25.280 
okay you see they still actually you can
see<00:04:21.070> more<00:04:21.310> on<00:04:21.430> there<00:04:21.840> still<00:04:22.840> jittering<00:04:23.380> and

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.290 
see more on there still jittering and

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:27.150 
see more on there still jittering and
not<00:04:26.290> very<00:04:26.380> clever<00:04:26.650> at<00:04:26.800> all

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
not very clever at all

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.760 
not very clever at all
so<00:04:27.360> my<00:04:28.360> conclusion<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:28.990> I'm<00:04:29.230> not<00:04:29.440> going<00:04:29.620> to<00:04:29.680> be

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
so my conclusion is I'm not going to be

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.730 
so my conclusion is I'm not going to be
using<00:04:30.670> this<00:04:30.790> with<00:04:31.030> my<00:04:31.210> high<00:04:31.390> tech<00:04:31.690> gear

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
using this with my high tech gear

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.090 
using this with my high tech gear
I<00:04:32.830> might<00:04:33.400> risk<00:04:33.640> it<00:04:33.910> on<00:04:34.060> small<00:04:34.560> indoor<00:04:35.560> foamies

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
I might risk it on small indoor foamies

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:38.400 
I might risk it on small indoor foamies
maybe<00:04:36.370> where<00:04:36.730> it<00:04:36.760> might<00:04:36.970> have<00:04:37.030> some<00:04:37.480> value<00:04:38.200> but

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
maybe where it might have some value but

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.870 
maybe where it might have some value but
then<00:04:38.560> you've<00:04:38.650> got<00:04:38.740> a<00:04:38.770> bit<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.370> a<00:04:39.490> weight<00:04:39.670> issue

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
then you've got a bit of a weight issue

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.520 
then you've got a bit of a weight issue
I<00:04:40.060> think<00:04:40.180> it<00:04:40.330> comes<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.870> weighs<00:04:41.020> in<00:04:41.230> at<00:04:41.350> nine

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
I think it comes it weighs in at nine

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.520 
I think it comes it weighs in at nine
point<00:04:41.770> nine<00:04:42.010> grams<00:04:42.780> five<00:04:43.780> point<00:04:44.020> five<00:04:44.230> without

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
point nine grams five point five without

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.920 
point nine grams five point five without
the<00:04:44.650> case<00:04:44.860> the<00:04:45.070> case<00:04:45.280> isn't<00:04:45.460> really<00:04:45.930> essential

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
the case the case isn't really essential

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.350 
the case the case isn't really essential
whatever<00:04:47.260> you<00:04:47.380> do<00:04:47.620> with<00:04:48.490> this<00:04:48.640> box<00:04:48.940> you<00:04:49.150> must

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
whatever you do with this box you must

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:53.070 
whatever you do with this box you must
mount<00:04:49.690> it<00:04:49.930> solidly<00:04:51.180> up<00:04:52.180> to<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.450> fuselage<00:04:52.840> any

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
mount it solidly up to the fuselage any

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:54.840 
mount it solidly up to the fuselage any
movement<00:04:53.650> in<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:53.830> at<00:04:54.280> all

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850 
movement in that at all

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:57.000 
movement in that at all
you<00:04:55.000> know<00:04:55.120> I<00:04:55.330> think<00:04:55.600> even<00:04:55.840> wrapped<00:04:56.770> in

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
you know I think even wrapped in

00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:59.280 
you know I think even wrapped in
anything<00:04:57.190> less<00:04:57.490> than<00:04:57.700> dense<00:04:57.970> foam<00:04:58.360> would

00:04:59.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
anything less than dense foam would

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.810 
anything less than dense foam would
cause<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.560> problem<00:04:59.800> in<00:05:00.040> flight<00:05:00.370> you<00:05:00.400> can<00:05:00.670> see

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
cause a problem in flight you can see

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:03.570 
cause a problem in flight you can see
how<00:05:00.940> just<00:05:01.150> that<00:05:01.210> little<00:05:01.390> movement<00:05:02.580> Trent

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
how just that little movement Trent

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.190 
how just that little movement Trent
would<00:05:03.790> translate<00:05:04.180> into<00:05:04.300> control<00:05:04.930> for<00:05:05.170> a

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:05.200 
would translate into control for a

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.080 
would translate into control for a
movement<00:05:05.470> so<00:05:05.950> you<00:05:06.160> actually<00:05:06.490> got<00:05:06.730> to<00:05:06.820> you've

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:07.090 
movement so you actually got to you've

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:10.040 
movement so you actually got to you've
got<00:05:07.120> to<00:05:07.270> make<00:05:07.390> sure<00:05:07.420> this<00:05:07.750> is<00:05:08.220> solidly

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:10.050 
got to make sure this is solidly

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.560 
got to make sure this is solidly
installed<00:05:11.050> in<00:05:11.290> the<00:05:11.620> fuselage<00:05:12.130> on<00:05:12.730> on<00:05:13.360> the

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
installed in the fuselage on on the

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.420 
installed in the fuselage on on the
testbed<00:05:13.960> I'm<00:05:14.080> going<00:05:14.320> to<00:05:14.440> use<00:05:14.650> I'm<00:05:15.280> actually

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
testbed I'm going to use I'm actually

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:16.620 
testbed I'm going to use I'm actually
going<00:05:15.640> to<00:05:15.700> just<00:05:15.760> all<00:05:16.030> this<00:05:16.150> on<00:05:16.330> top<00:05:16.420> of<00:05:16.570> the

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 
going to just all this on top of the

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:18.180 
going to just all this on top of the
wing<00:05:16.810> so<00:05:17.050> I<00:05:17.110> can<00:05:17.200> get<00:05:17.320> easy<00:05:17.500> access<00:05:17.950> to<00:05:18.100> the

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:18.190 
wing so I can get easy access to the

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:21.330 
wing so I can get easy access to the
game<00:05:18.450> until<00:05:19.450> everything's<00:05:19.900> set<00:05:20.200> up<00:05:20.230> but<00:05:20.650> so

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
game until everything's set up but so

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:22.320 
game until everything's set up but so
that's<00:05:21.520> it

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
that's it

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.820 
that's it
warts<00:05:23.020> and<00:05:23.200> all<00:05:23.320> hope<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.280> was<00:05:24.550> useful<00:05:25.830> this

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:26.830 
warts and all hope that was useful this

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.740 
warts and all hope that was useful this
is<00:05:26.980> ways<00:05:27.220> from<00:05:27.460> our<00:05:27.700> cmf<00:05:28.740> kook
