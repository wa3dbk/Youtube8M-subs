quite making in there gotta respect some
of<00:02:04.579> these<00:02:04.700> hair<00:02:05.360> pins<00:02:05.860> right<00:02:06.860> right<00:02:07.429> earlier

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
of these hair pins right right earlier

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.220 
of these hair pins right right earlier
than<00:02:07.970> you<00:02:08.060> expect

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:13.990 

that's<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.010> end<00:02:13.099> of<00:02:13.159> next<00:02:13.250> section<00:02:13.760> we're

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
that's the end of next section we're

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.100 
that's the end of next section we're
going<00:02:14.090> to<00:02:14.180> run<00:02:14.269> that<00:02:14.450> again<00:02:14.690> now<00:02:14.870> from<00:02:15.080> a

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
going to run that again now from a

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.600 
going to run that again now from a
different<00:02:15.500> viewpoint<00:02:15.680> see<00:02:16.610> how<00:02:16.730> we<00:02:16.790> get<00:02:16.970> on<00:02:18.610> ok

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
different viewpoint see how we get on ok

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.370 
different viewpoint see how we get on ok
now<00:02:19.790> we're<00:02:19.909> going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.060> try<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.299> in<00:02:20.540> car<00:02:20.810> view

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
now we're going to try it in car view

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.430 
now we're going to try it in car view
so<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.410> lot<00:02:23.650> of<00:02:23.680> you<00:02:23.860> are<00:02:23.950> using<00:02:24.190> as<00:02:24.430> few<00:02:24.640> as<00:02:24.730> well

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
so a lot of you are using as few as well

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.780 
so a lot of you are using as few as well
codemasters<00:02:26.440> and<00:02:26.680> obviously<00:02:27.520> very

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790

of<00:03:21.650> you<00:03:21.769> know<00:03:21.799> I<00:03:21.950> tend<00:03:22.310> to<00:03:22.340> play<00:03:22.629> bumper<00:03:23.629> cam<00:03:24.019> or

of you know I tend to play bumper cam or

of you know I tend to play bumper cam or
bonnet<00:03:25.430> camps<00:03:25.879> who<00:03:26.090> are<00:03:26.209> uncomfortable<00:03:26.450> in

bonnet camps who are uncomfortable in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:31.270 
bonnet camps who are uncomfortable in
the<00:03:27.019> field<00:03:27.260> of<00:03:27.319> view<00:03:28.450> nice<00:03:29.680> lighting<00:03:30.680> effects

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
the field of view nice lighting effects

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.890 
the field of view nice lighting effects
there<00:03:31.519> as<00:03:31.700> well<00:03:36.940> breaking<00:03:37.940> way<00:03:38.120> too<00:03:38.180> late<00:03:38.599> for

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
there as well breaking way too late for

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.720 
there as well breaking way too late for
some<00:03:39.079> reason<00:03:39.319> that<00:03:39.440> corner<00:03:39.829> we<00:03:40.340> near<00:03:40.579> the<00:03:40.610> end

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
some reason that corner we near the end

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:42.399 
some reason that corner we near the end
of<00:03:40.909> stage<00:03:41.209> so<00:03:41.450> we<00:03:41.480> just<00:03:41.690> go<00:03:41.840> over<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.019> line<00:03:42.200> now

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
of stage so we just go over the line now

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.890 
of stage so we just go over the line now
and<00:03:42.650> then<00:03:43.579> little<00:03:43.849> bit<00:03:43.970> more<00:03:44.120> these<00:03:44.329> theory<00:03:44.720> of

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and then little bit more these theory of

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:51.729 
and then little bit more these theory of
use

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:56.119 

so<00:03:52.739> that's<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.190> done<00:03:54.530> on<00:03:55.530> to<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.799> exterior

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
so that's that done on to the exterior

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:02.930 
so that's that done on to the exterior
view<00:03:56.459> points<00:03:56.790> so<00:03:57.209> we<00:03:57.239> start<00:03:57.629> again<00:04:01.099> this<00:04:02.099> far

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
view points so we start again this far

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.020 
view points so we start again this far
away<00:04:03.269> view<00:04:03.950> which<00:04:04.950> you<00:04:05.129> could<00:04:05.370> look<00:04:05.730> at<00:04:05.879> the

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
away view which you could look at the

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.170 
away view which you could look at the
road<00:04:06.659> ahead<00:04:06.840> again<00:04:07.290> 40<00:04:07.980> yeah

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
road ahead again 40 yeah

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.149 
road ahead again 40 yeah
it's<00:04:10.930> different<00:04:11.109> controlling<00:04:11.680> the<00:04:11.769> car<00:04:11.980> from

00:04:12.149 --> 00:04:12.159 
it's different controlling the car from

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.809 
it's different controlling the car from
this<00:04:12.340> view<00:04:12.579> if<00:04:12.909> you<00:04:13.060> keep<00:04:13.930> their<00:04:14.170> I<00:04:14.640> tend<00:04:15.640> to<00:04:15.670> be

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
this view if you keep their I tend to be

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:18.180 
this view if you keep their I tend to be
a<00:04:15.849> little<00:04:15.969> bit<00:04:16.180> heavy-handed<00:04:16.419> but<00:04:16.989> if<00:04:17.859> you

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
a little bit heavy-handed but if you

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.670 
a little bit heavy-handed but if you
will<00:04:18.340> know<00:04:18.459> I<00:04:18.489> do<00:04:18.669> too<00:04:18.940> long<00:04:19.180> as<00:04:19.239> a<00:04:19.299> wheel<00:04:19.590> and<00:04:20.590> I

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
will know I do too long as a wheel and I

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.590 
will know I do too long as a wheel and I
play<00:04:20.919> these<00:04:21.130> games<00:04:21.370> I'm<00:04:21.970> looking<00:04:22.270> forward<00:04:22.449> to

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:22.600 
play these games I'm looking forward to

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.170 
play these games I'm looking forward to
yeah<00:04:23.590> testing<00:04:24.280> the<00:04:24.310> real<00:04:24.550> on<00:04:24.639> this<00:04:24.789> as<00:04:25.000> well

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 
yeah testing the real on this as well

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:26.909 
yeah testing the real on this as well
especially<00:04:25.449> on<00:04:25.750> the<00:04:25.840> Gymkhana<00:04:26.259> mode<00:04:26.530> we<00:04:26.889> can

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
especially on the Gymkhana mode we can

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:36.110 
especially on the Gymkhana mode we can
that<00:04:27.190> can<00:04:27.340> be<00:04:27.960> quite<00:04:28.960> something<00:04:29.199> Oh

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.050 

more<00:04:36.720> staples<00:04:36.960> hold<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.440> together<00:04:37.590> there

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.170 

easy<00:04:41.060> left<00:04:41.390> onto<00:04:41.630> bridge<00:04:41.950> so<00:04:42.950> again<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:44.030> learn

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
easy left onto bridge so again to learn

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:45.850 
easy left onto bridge so again to learn
all<00:04:44.210> these<00:04:44.450> corners<00:04:44.900> get<00:04:45.170> a<00:04:45.200> feel<00:04:45.440> for<00:04:45.710> them

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
all these corners get a feel for them

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.730 
all these corners get a feel for them
easy<00:04:46.490> left<00:04:46.700> over<00:04:47.000> John<00:04:47.230> I'm<00:04:48.230> being<00:04:48.470> way<00:04:48.710> too
