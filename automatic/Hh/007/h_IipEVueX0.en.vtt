00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.219 
not so much I can't say that the story
is<00:02:01.950> bad<00:02:02.250> but<00:02:02.820> it<00:02:02.970> feels<00:02:03.150> a<00:02:03.330> tad<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.780> too<00:02:03.960> slow

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
is bad but it feels a tad bit too slow

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.230 
is bad but it feels a tad bit too slow
taking<00:02:04.830> itself<00:02:05.070> a<00:02:05.220> little<00:02:05.340> too<00:02:05.580> serious<00:02:06.090> and

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
taking itself a little too serious and

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.960 
taking itself a little too serious and
not<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.720> trying<00:02:06.900> anything<00:02:07.229> new<00:02:07.439> if<00:02:07.970> you

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
not really trying anything new if you

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:10.639 
not really trying anything new if you
want<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.330> decent<00:02:09.750> enough<00:02:09.840> story<00:02:10.349> to<00:02:10.530> get

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
want a decent enough story to get

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.500 
want a decent enough story to get
through<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.069> game<00:02:11.250> this<00:02:11.640> will<00:02:11.849> do<00:02:12.060> but<00:02:12.480> I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
through the game this will do but I

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.210 
through the game this will do but I
expect<00:02:12.959> a<00:02:13.049> lot<00:02:13.200> more<00:02:13.260> out<00:02:13.620> of<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.799> Warhammer

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
expect a lot more out of the Warhammer

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:24.260 
expect a lot more out of the Warhammer
series<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.909> a<00:02:14.939> story

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.750 

with<00:02:25.270> warhammer<00:02:25.600> I<00:02:26.170> can't<00:02:26.709> say<00:02:26.980> I<00:02:27.010> was<00:02:27.280> overly

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:27.760 
with warhammer I can't say I was overly

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.360 
with warhammer I can't say I was overly
impressed<00:02:27.990> with<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:29.140> designs<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.680> the<00:02:29.740> area's

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
impressed with the designs of the area's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.580 
impressed with the designs of the area's
some<00:02:30.790> areas<00:02:31.180> were<00:02:31.330> nice<00:02:31.540> enough<00:02:31.750> but<00:02:32.470> the

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
some areas were nice enough but the

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.100 
some areas were nice enough but the
majority<00:02:32.890> felt<00:02:33.310> like<00:02:33.459> they<00:02:33.580> lacked<00:02:33.959> spirit<00:02:34.959> I

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
majority felt like they lacked spirit I

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.390 
majority felt like they lacked spirit I
guess<00:02:35.380> they<00:02:35.950> were<00:02:36.010> just<00:02:36.130> very

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
guess they were just very

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.490 
guess they were just very
straightforward<00:02:37.150> corridors<00:02:37.720> and<00:02:37.990> sometimes

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
straightforward corridors and sometimes

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.800 
straightforward corridors and sometimes
out<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.070> field<00:02:39.430> but<00:02:39.940> mostly<00:02:40.270> the<00:02:40.480> fields

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
out in the field but mostly the fields

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.170 
out in the field but mostly the fields
were<00:02:40.900> brown<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.590> scraps<00:02:42.459> a<00:02:42.610> metal<00:02:42.880> here<00:02:43.030> and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
were brown and scraps a metal here and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.810 
were brown and scraps a metal here and
there<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.480> kind<00:02:43.720> of<00:02:43.810> use<00:02:44.230> recover<00:02:44.620> on<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.610> flip

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:45.820 
there to kind of use recover on the flip

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.699 
there to kind of use recover on the flip
side<00:02:45.850> though<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.360> animations<00:02:46.959> are<00:02:47.080> great<00:02:47.350> the

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
while some of the environments could use

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.300
