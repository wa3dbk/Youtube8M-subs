when you use the stock head you get more

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:26.640 
when you use the stock head you get more
compression<00:00:25.359> we<00:00:25.929> remember<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.409> more

your scooter is going to be but we like
to<00:00:30.939> run<00:00:31.089> it<00:00:31.239> without<00:00:31.500> but<00:00:32.500> this<00:00:32.619> is<00:00:32.740> the<00:00:32.860> stock

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
to run it without but this is the stock

head that came out of it this head

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.520 
head that came out of it this head
doesn't<00:00:36.610> work<00:00:36.940> on<00:00:37.120> every<00:00:37.480> single<00:00:37.510> scooter<00:00:38.110> but

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
doesn't work on every single scooter but

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.550 
doesn't work on every single scooter but
it<00:00:38.650> works<00:00:38.830> on<00:00:39.010> I<00:00:39.070> would<00:00:39.250> say<00:00:39.280> 90%<00:00:39.790> of<00:00:40.180> them<00:00:40.560> and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
it works on I would say 90% of them and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:44.130 
it works on I would say 90% of them and
then<00:00:41.770> it<00:00:42.700> comes<00:00:42.910> with<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.090> piston<00:00:43.450> a<00:00:43.600> DCCC

rather go with the six or a four but
they<00:00:57.220> come<00:00:57.640> with<00:00:57.760> a<00:00:57.790> kit<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:59.350> get<00:00:59.470> an<00:00:59.590> oil<00:00:59.740> pump

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
they come with a kit you get an oil pump

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.880 
they come with a kit you get an oil pump
sprocket<00:01:00.550> and<00:01:00.670> oil<00:01:00.970> pump<00:01:01.300> now<00:01:02.230> well<00:01:02.410> even

sprocket and oil pump now well even

though that this oil pump comes with it

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.480 
though that this oil pump comes with it
you<00:01:04.720> think<00:01:05.379> it'd<00:01:05.500> be<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.620> bigger<00:01:05.860> pump<00:01:06.159> it's

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
you think it'd be a bigger pump it's

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.730 
you think it'd be a bigger pump it's
actually<00:01:06.880> not<00:01:06.970> a<00:01:07.030> bigger<00:01:07.300> pump<00:01:07.740> we've

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
actually not a bigger pump we've

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.520 
actually not a bigger pump we've
measured<00:01:09.070> it<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:09.640> it's<00:01:10.090> not<00:01:10.270> so<00:01:10.810> we<00:01:11.350> don't

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:11.530 
measured it and it's not so we don't

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.440 
measured it and it's not so we don't
install<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.100> pump<00:01:12.400> it's<00:01:12.790> not<00:01:12.940> a<00:01:12.970> bigger<00:01:13.240> one

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
install this pump it's not a bigger one

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.060 
install this pump it's not a bigger one
unless<00:01:14.080> you<00:01:14.260> have<00:01:14.380> a<00:01:14.409> problem<00:01:14.710> with<00:01:14.800> your<00:01:14.920> pump

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
unless you have a problem with your pump

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.030 
unless you have a problem with your pump
you<00:01:15.340> don't<00:01:15.520> need<00:01:15.700> to<00:01:15.880> install<00:01:16.330> this<00:01:16.570> pump<00:01:17.290> now

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
you don't need to install this pump now

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.530 
you don't need to install this pump now
of<00:01:18.190> course<00:01:18.250> piston<00:01:18.820> rings<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:20.260> oil<00:01:20.890> rings<00:01:21.540> and

of course piston rings and oil rings and

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.380 
of course piston rings and oil rings and
then<00:01:22.720> you<00:01:22.840> got<00:01:22.990> your<00:01:23.020> studs<00:01:23.470> for<00:01:23.710> the<00:01:23.770> head<00:01:24.390> you

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
then you got your studs for the head you

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.140 
then you got your studs for the head you
know<00:01:25.479> screw<00:01:25.900> in<00:01:26.050> here<00:01:26.080> and<00:01:26.790> then<00:01:27.790> you've<00:01:27.970> also

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
know screw in here and then you've also

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.170 
know screw in here and then you've also
got<00:01:28.300> your<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.659> DCCC<00:01:29.590> cylinder<00:01:30.130> which<00:01:30.310> is<00:01:30.490> most

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:31.180 
got your a DCCC cylinder which is most

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:33.200 
got your a DCCC cylinder which is most
important<00:01:31.570> part<00:01:31.720> of<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.840> whole<00:01:31.930> thing<00:01:31.990> and<00:01:32.380> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
important part of the whole thing and a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.840 
important part of the whole thing and a
piston<00:01:34.210> pin<00:01:34.390> with<00:01:35.049> the<00:01:35.170> three<00:01:35.350> clips<00:01:35.590> so<00:01:36.580> this

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
piston pin with the three clips so this

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.050 
piston pin with the three clips so this
kit<00:01:38.010> when<00:01:39.010> you<00:01:39.100> install<00:01:39.460> it<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.790> makes<00:01:39.970> your

kit when you install it it makes your

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.610 
kit when you install it it makes your
scooter<00:01:40.330> feel<00:01:40.540> like<00:01:40.720> you've<00:01:40.870> got<00:01:41.049> double<00:01:41.380> the

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:41.620 
scooter feel like you've got double the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.969 
scooter feel like you've got double the
power

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
power

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:43.980 
power
you're<00:01:42.790> probably<00:01:42.970> in<00:01:43.270> reality<00:01:43.420> it's<00:01:43.900> not

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
you're probably in reality it's not

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.440 
you're probably in reality it's not
double<00:01:44.409> the<00:01:44.500> power<00:01:44.680> but<00:01:45.580> it<00:01:45.820> sure<00:01:46.060> feels<00:01:46.270> like

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
double the power but it sure feels like

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.690 
double the power but it sure feels like
it<00:01:46.600> we've<00:01:47.080> installed<00:01:47.440> over<00:01:47.710> 300<00:01:48.310> these<00:01:48.430> in

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
it we've installed over 300 these in

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.680 
it we've installed over 300 these in
here<00:01:48.880> in<00:01:48.970> Denver<00:01:49.210> Colorado<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:51.490> if<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.119> if
