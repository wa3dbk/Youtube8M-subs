 18 years in this mode the car in situations where this is 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.369
 solved is not enough 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.510
 to receive the tournament 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.230
 how much harder

 he is a musician 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:39.940
 rachel madeirense 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.940
 but once in a while 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.550
 vertically 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.550
 the pilot maneuver almost hit

 browsers 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.260
 the pilot out of the car 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.850
 I'm a team. 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.530
 the pilot must obey to trust 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.200
 how on the outside 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.100
 then it is not the more calm and the more he heard the expotrade and I drank 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.100
 even sometimes with a little bit of better fear but overcame 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.810
 I ended up getting thirty tons 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.700
 it was mean 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.700
 you hit 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:34.670
 It is a city 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.670
 in round on match in the middle 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.660
 It felt very good. 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.440
 smart to realize if you hurt in the neira phase of taking 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.310
 to overturn is not difficult 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.530
 the security 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.310
 the Portuguese pilot that the patient 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.240
 I feel that efforts 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.520
 as it is called that obstacle that we are going to transpose I believe that its ends 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.370
 so are good there the very good pregnant stage 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.350
 I'm going to go to the second with a lot of articulation and a cross 

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 it's time for patience 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:22.319
 no need to accelerate is not necessary 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.109
 at first speed will usually be too much speed control 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:29.589
 slowly trying on his name car just watching that side of us 

00:02:30.869 --> 00:02:33.839
 with evelyn delete 

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:35.889
 we can not wait to see 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:38.889
 change owner 

00:02:42.249 --> 00:02:43.759
 paulo autuori 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.759
 for the suspension tender 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:52.119
 1 with a tire or more than one meter in height with the other three on the ground 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:53.429
 then that's it 

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:56.429
 I confess technology what we're doing 

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:05.289
 the airplanes 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.299
 end here 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.930
 much harder to have an image on the wave I thought it was actually the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.259
 to be able to make mine hostile can put the car in a very certain point 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:19.779
 in fact you have to have a very great sensitivity with regard to 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:22.779
 to the equipment 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:28.889
 but the leader 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.889
 still trying 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:39.119
 is indeed an opinion for me 

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:40.769
 is this idea of ​​working 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:42.829
 shortly after 6:00 p.m. 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:45.789
 the excess of freedom and the new day again
