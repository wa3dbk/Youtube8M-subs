shape it and jiggle it a little bit this

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.500 
shape it and jiggle it a little bit this
will<00:01:14.950> help<00:01:15.159> the<00:01:15.310> excess<00:01:15.760> water<00:01:16.060> flow<00:01:16.479> out

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
will help the excess water flow out

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.200 
will help the excess water flow out
which<00:01:17.409> allows<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:18.010> sand<00:01:18.310> grains<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.880> really

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
which allows the sand grains to really

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.780 
which allows the sand grains to really
lock<00:01:19.510> together<00:01:19.960> you<00:01:20.920> have<00:01:21.070> to<00:01:21.220> repeat<00:01:21.550> this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
lock together you have to repeat this

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.880 
lock together you have to repeat this
quite<00:01:22.150> a<00:01:22.180> few<00:01:22.270> times<00:01:22.690> as<00:01:23.050> each<00:01:23.200> individual

quite a few times as each individual
cake<00:01:24.250> only<00:01:24.670> adds<00:01:24.850> about<00:01:25.119> one<00:01:25.600> inch<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.020> your

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
cake only adds about one inch to your

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.280 
cake only adds about one inch to your
towers<00:01:26.560> height<00:01:27.060> but<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.210> added<00:01:28.479> stability<00:01:28.720> of
