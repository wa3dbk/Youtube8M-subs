00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.420 
involves a lot of like detailed
perspective<00:03:28.319> and<00:03:28.470> stuff<00:03:28.650> like<00:03:28.859> that<00:03:29.040> and<00:03:29.280> I

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
perspective and stuff like that and I

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.800 
perspective and stuff like that and I
remember<00:03:29.549> trying<00:03:29.849> to<00:03:30.030> draw<00:03:30.150> this<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.629> it<00:03:30.690> was

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
remember trying to draw this and it was

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.309 
remember trying to draw this and it was
like<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.639> also<00:03:32.639> want<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.389> art<00:03:33.599> of<00:03:33.720> tracing

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
like it I also want the art of tracing

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.409 
like it I also want the art of tracing
when<00:03:34.470> I<00:03:34.590> was<00:03:34.769> pretty<00:03:35.010> young<00:03:35.099> and<00:03:35.519> I'm<00:03:36.180> gonna<00:03:36.269> be

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
when I was pretty young and I'm gonna be

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.000 
when I was pretty young and I'm gonna be
honest<00:03:36.690> with<00:03:36.810> you<00:03:36.900> guys<00:03:36.930> it<00:03:37.260> actually<00:03:37.620> helped

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
honest with you guys it actually helped

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.699 
honest with you guys it actually helped
me<00:03:38.220> learn<00:03:38.340> drawing<00:03:38.699> a<00:03:38.940> lot<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.440> and<00:03:40.440> I<00:03:40.530> got

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
me learn drawing a lot more and I got

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.129 
me learn drawing a lot more and I got
better<00:03:40.949> at<00:03:41.129> drawing<00:03:41.370> because<00:03:41.699> once<00:03:42.690> I<00:03:42.840> learned

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
better at drawing because once I learned

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:44.990 
better at drawing because once I learned
how<00:03:43.230> to<00:03:43.260> trace<00:03:43.650> like<00:03:43.949> I<00:03:44.129> understood<00:03:44.699> wine

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
how to trace like I understood wine

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.319 
how to trace like I understood wine
better<00:03:45.329> and<00:03:45.859> this<00:03:46.859> is<00:03:47.010> an<00:03:47.190> example<00:03:47.519> of<00:03:47.879> I<00:03:48.060> loved

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
better and this is an example of I loved

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.349 
better and this is an example of I loved
the<00:03:48.480> Lion<00:03:48.720> King<00:03:49.040> this<00:03:50.040> is<00:03:50.190> an<00:03:50.280> example<00:03:50.790> of<00:03:51.030> how

the Lion King this is an example of how

00:03:51.359 --> 00:03:54.409 
the Lion King this is an example of how
I<00:03:51.389> kind<00:03:51.780> of<00:03:51.900> was<00:03:52.500> tracing<00:03:53.190> trying<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.120> figure

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
I kind of was tracing trying to figure

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.119 
I kind of was tracing trying to figure
out<00:03:54.540> how<00:03:54.750> wines<00:03:55.049> make<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.379> picture<00:03:55.829> and<00:03:55.949> stuff

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
out how wines make a picture and stuff

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.099 
out how wines make a picture and stuff
like<00:03:56.400> that<00:03:56.669> I<00:03:56.970> was<00:03:57.239> pretty<00:03:57.480> young<00:03:57.569> when<00:03:57.720> I<00:03:57.930> did

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
like that I was pretty young when I did

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.280 
like that I was pretty young when I did
that<00:03:58.230> I<00:03:58.290> don't<00:03:58.440> remember<00:03:58.889> exactly<00:04:00.019> how<00:04:01.019> old<00:04:01.199> I

was but I was pretty young I was such a
little<00:04:04.379> cheater<00:04:04.739> I<00:04:04.889> thought<00:04:05.310> that<00:04:05.519> too<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.849> I

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910

was can I was like I'm totally cheating
by<00:04:07.680> like<00:04:07.919> tracing<00:04:08.220> this<00:04:08.459> picture<00:04:08.849> I<00:04:09.030> think

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
by like tracing this picture I think

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.050 
by like tracing this picture I think
this<00:04:09.540> is<00:04:09.660> my<00:04:09.840> brother<00:04:10.430> this<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.669> a<00:04:11.699> really

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
the computer table which he still does

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.849 
the computer table which he still does
so<00:04:16.859> always<00:04:17.099> on<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.340> computer

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
so always on the computer

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
part of my sketchbook actually developed

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.330 
part of my sketchbook actually developed
somewhat<00:04:37.690> of<00:04:37.810> like<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.020> storyline<00:04:38.620> going<00:04:39.159> on

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
somewhat of like a storyline going on

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:41.850 
somewhat of like a storyline going on
and<00:04:39.610> I<00:04:40.060> put<00:04:40.270> a<00:04:40.300> course<00:04:40.659> no<00:04:40.870> Marcus<00:04:41.349> who's<00:04:41.680> my

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
and I put a course no Marcus who's my

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.200 
and I put a course no Marcus who's my
brother<00:04:42.159> and<00:04:43.680> the<00:04:44.680> spelling<00:04:45.039> is<00:04:45.490> gonna<00:04:46.060> be

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
brother and the spelling is gonna be

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.020 
brother and the spelling is gonna be
really<00:04:46.509> atrocious<00:04:46.889> and<00:04:47.889> my<00:04:48.460> spelling<00:04:48.729> is

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
really atrocious and my spelling is

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:51.890 
really atrocious and my spelling is
still<00:04:49.300> pretty<00:04:49.599> bad<00:04:50.379> but<00:04:50.830> you<00:04:50.919> know<00:04:51.099> what<00:04:51.310> I

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
still pretty bad but you know what I

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.520 
still pretty bad but you know what I
roll<00:04:52.900> with<00:04:53.080> it

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
roll with it

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:57.450 
roll with it
so<00:04:54.069> I<00:04:54.430> just<00:04:54.819> drew<00:04:55.030> like<00:04:55.210> a<00:04:55.240> little<00:04:56.460> unicorn

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
so I just drew like a little unicorn

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.600 
so I just drew like a little unicorn
thing<00:04:58.319> and<00:04:59.319> I<00:04:59.530> let's<00:04:59.919> see<00:05:00.069> if<00:05:00.159> I<00:05:00.250> could<00:05:00.400> still

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:00.610 
thing and I let's see if I could still

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.719 
thing and I let's see if I could still
interpret<00:05:01.090> this<00:05:01.270> it<00:05:01.569> says<00:05:03.030> once<00:05:04.440> upon<00:05:05.440> a<00:05:06.009> time

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
interpret this it says once upon a time

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.330 
interpret this it says once upon a time
there<00:05:07.659> was<00:05:08.229> a<00:05:09.270> place<00:05:10.270> that<00:05:10.300> had<00:05:11.340> unusual

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
there was a place that had unusual

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.089 
there was a place that had unusual
creatures<00:05:13.060> and<00:05:13.780> this<00:05:13.960> is<00:05:14.139> like<00:05:14.349> my<00:05:14.969> little

00:05:17.089 --> 00:05:17.099 
creatures and this is like my little

00:05:17.099 --> 00:05:18.839 
creatures and this is like my little
person<00:05:18.099> on<00:05:18.219> a<00:05:18.250> pony

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:18.849 
person on a pony

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.490 
person on a pony
whatever<00:05:19.840> MANET<00:05:20.379> are<00:05:20.669> whatever<00:05:21.669> and<00:05:22.419> then<00:05:23.380> it

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
whatever MANET are whatever and then it

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:27.480 
whatever MANET are whatever and then it
says<00:05:24.240> there<00:05:25.240> was<00:05:25.690> water<00:05:26.259> things<00:05:26.740> too<00:05:27.159> but<00:05:27.430> I

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
says there was water things too but I

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.640 
says there was water things too but I
spelt<00:05:27.849> water<00:05:28.150> with<00:05:28.509> an<00:05:28.659> X<00:05:28.930> or<00:05:29.169> something<00:05:29.409> I

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
spelt water with an X or something I

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.350 
spelt water with an X or something I
don't<00:05:29.860> know<00:05:30.490> maybe<00:05:30.729> that<00:05:30.849> was<00:05:31.000> just<00:05:31.180> like<00:05:31.300> a

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
don't know maybe that was just like a
