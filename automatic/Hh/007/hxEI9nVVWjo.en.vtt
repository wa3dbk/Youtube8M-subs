00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
jellybean 4.1 now the thing that makes

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.170 
jellybean 4.1 now the thing that makes
it<00:01:06.600> so<00:01:06.780> special<00:01:06.920> amongst<00:01:07.920> a<00:01:08.070> whole<00:01:08.880> bunch<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
integrated a new style of multi view

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.320 
integrated a new style of multi view
that<00:01:14.159> we<00:01:14.250> haven't<00:01:14.460> seen<00:01:14.549> before<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.180> is

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
called floating windows so Ryan gear is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.109 
called floating windows so Ryan gear is
going<00:01:19.560> to<00:01:19.740> demonstrate<00:01:20.130> it<00:01:20.430> for<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.700> just

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:48.320 
multi-vue but it was just a half and

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.020 
multi-vue but it was just a half and
half<00:01:48.470> where<00:01:48.650> exactly<00:01:48.770> left<00:01:49.460> and<00:01:49.640> right<00:01:49.760> sides

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
half where exactly left and right sides

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.970 
half where exactly left and right sides
yeah<00:01:50.330> so<00:01:50.570> this<00:01:50.690> is<00:01:50.750> floating<00:01:51.290> and<00:01:51.740> then<00:01:51.890> we

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:51.980 
yeah so this is floating and then we

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.700 
yeah so this is floating and then we
also<00:01:52.130> have<00:01:52.280> the<00:01:52.610> traditional<00:01:52.760> do<00:01:53.270> love<00:01:53.420> you

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
also have the traditional do love you

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.020 
also have the traditional do love you
right<00:01:54.710> there<00:01:54.950> so<00:01:55.190> where<00:01:55.310> it<00:01:55.400> snaps<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.850> two

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
right there so where it snaps the two

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.410 
right there so where it snaps the two
off<00:01:56.180> to<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.510> sides<00:01:56.750> or<00:01:57.500> cascade<00:01:58.040> view<00:01:58.420> right

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
off to the sides or cascade view right

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.610 
off to the sides or cascade view right
there<00:01:59.450> floating<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:00.230> can<00:02:00.350> move<00:02:00.470> them

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:00.620 
there floating and you can move them

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.910 
there floating and you can move them
around<00:02:00.770> I<00:02:01.220> can<00:02:01.490> pin<00:02:01.700> one<00:02:01.910> on<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.270> top<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:03.260> say

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 
around I can pin one on the top so say

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:04.990 
around I can pin one on the top so say
for<00:02:03.950> example<00:02:04.130> i<00:02:04.520> launched<00:02:04.760> another

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
for example i launched another

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.590 
for example i launched another
application<00:02:06.940> let's<00:02:07.940> see<00:02:08.090> let's<00:02:08.360> launch

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
application let's see let's launch

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.170 
application let's see let's launch
calendar<00:02:09.440> let's<00:02:09.649> say

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
calendar let's say

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.140 
calendar let's say
kidnap<00:02:12.170> stays<00:02:12.469> on<00:02:12.680> top<00:02:12.920> so<00:02:13.400> at<00:02:13.849> least<00:02:13.969> for

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
kidnap stays on top so at least for

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.390 
kidnap stays on top so at least for
multitasking<00:02:14.739> it<00:02:15.739> really<00:02:15.920> make<00:02:16.159> takes

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
multitasking it really make takes

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.099 
multitasking it really make takes
advantage<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.879> that<00:02:17.000> big<00:02:17.209> 10.1<00:02:17.870> inch<00:02:18.019> screen

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
advantage of that big 10.1 inch screen

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.619 
advantage of that big 10.1 inch screen
for<00:02:18.620> a<00:02:18.680> lot<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.950> useful<00:02:19.099> yeah<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.209> these

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
for a lot of useful yeah and these

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.020 
for a lot of useful yeah and these
cascading<00:02:21.079> windows<00:02:21.620> can<00:02:22.609> be<00:02:22.640> more<00:02:22.849> than<00:02:22.909> just

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
cascading windows can be more than just

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.149 
cascading windows can be more than just
too<00:02:23.329> much<00:02:23.689> is<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:23.989> other<00:02:24.109> cool<00:02:24.319> thing<00:02:24.500> exactly

00:02:25.149 --> 00:02:25.159 
too much is the other cool thing exactly

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.490 
too much is the other cool thing exactly
we<00:02:25.280> can<00:02:25.430> have<00:02:25.640> multiple<00:02:26.299> cascading<00:02:27.230> windows

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
we can have multiple cascading windows

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.309 
we can have multiple cascading windows
so<00:02:27.680> here<00:02:27.920> with<00:02:28.540> multi<00:02:29.540> window<00:02:29.659> before<00:02:29.959> you

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
so here with multi window before you

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.750 
so here with multi window before you
could<00:02:30.439> only<00:02:30.560> do<00:02:30.769> two<00:02:31.010> apps<00:02:31.219> one<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.639> either

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:31.760 
could only do two apps one on either

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:34.599 
could only do two apps one on either
side<00:02:32.230> everybody<00:02:33.230> will<00:02:33.379> reopen<00:02:33.560> and<00:02:34.129> I<00:02:34.189> can<00:02:34.400> go

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:34.609 
side everybody will reopen and I can go

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.690 
side everybody will reopen and I can go
ahead<00:02:34.700> and<00:02:34.849> continue<00:02:35.090> to<00:02:35.299> open<00:02:35.599> applications

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
ahead and continue to open applications

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.800 
ahead and continue to open applications
and<00:02:37.700> you<00:02:37.849> can<00:02:37.969> also<00:02:38.290> pinch<00:02:39.290> to<00:02:40.510> expand<00:02:41.510> or

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
and you can also pinch to expand or

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.839 
and you can also pinch to expand or
contract<00:02:42.069> exactly<00:02:43.069> so<00:02:43.220> if<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.340> go<00:02:43.459> back<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.760> the

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
contract exactly so if I go back to the

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.090 
contract exactly so if I go back to the
gallery<00:02:44.150> here<00:02:44.299> for<00:02:44.510> example

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:46.100 
gallery here for example

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.080 
gallery here for example
besides

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.580 

there<00:02:52.660> we<00:02:52.810> go<00:02:54.599> aside<00:02:55.599> for<00:02:55.870> a<00:02:55.900> second<00:02:56.349> I<00:02:56.440> can

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
there we go aside for a second I can

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.030 
there we go aside for a second I can
research<00:02:57.010> that

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
research that

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.319 
research that
so<00:02:59.370> I<00:02:59.430> can<00:02:59.579> resize<00:02:59.939> those<00:03:00.269> windows<00:03:02.329> they're

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:03.329 
so I can resize those windows they're

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:08.720 
so I can resize those windows they're
running<00:03:05.629> great<00:03:06.629> well<00:03:06.900> that's<00:03:07.140> a<00:03:07.459> nice<00:03:08.459> sneak
