00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
me a while to figure this line out so

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.820 
me a while to figure this line out so
you<00:01:11.490> come<00:01:11.640> over<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.780> do<00:01:12.930> some<00:01:13.170> flips<00:01:13.439> get

hard<00:01:51.039> part<00:01:51.250> is<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.670> wingsuit<00:01:52.030> seemed<00:01:52.299> to

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
hard part is is the wingsuit seemed to

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.330 
hard part is is the wingsuit seemed to
sporadically<00:01:53.229> open<00:01:53.590> different<00:01:53.890> direction<00:01:54.219> so

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
sporadically open different direction so

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.440 
sporadically open different direction so
it's<00:01:54.460> hard<00:01:54.640> to<00:01:54.670> always<00:01:54.939> have<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.240> facing

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
forward so you can care that momentum

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.080 
forward so you can care that momentum
forward<00:01:56.979> that's<00:01:57.640> right<00:01:57.789> here<00:01:57.969> are<00:01:58.060> some
