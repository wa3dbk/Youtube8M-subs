which<00:00:22.590> doesn't<00:00:23.039> use<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.369> accelerometer<00:00:23.699> it

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
which doesn't use the accelerometer it

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.380 
which doesn't use the accelerometer it
uses<00:00:24.840> multi-touch<00:00:25.410> instead<00:00:25.949> that<00:00:26.820> means<00:00:27.119> I

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
uses multi-touch instead that means I

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.810 
uses multi-touch instead that means I
can<00:00:27.779> play<00:00:27.990> it<00:00:28.140> very<00:00:28.170> discreetly<00:00:29.039> without

be very very useful when I'm in my most
common<00:00:38.010> gaming<00:00:38.489> situation<00:00:39.090> which<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.719> sitting

common gaming situation which is sitting

common gaming situation which is sitting
in<00:00:40.920> very<00:00:41.280> very<00:00:41.610> dull<00:00:41.969> meetings<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:45.000> concept

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
in very very dull meetings the concept

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.529 
in very very dull meetings the concept
is<00:00:45.719> remarkably<00:00:46.440> simple<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.730> have<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.210> simply

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
is remarkably simple you have to simply

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.260 
is remarkably simple you have to simply
redirect<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.890> water<00:00:49.920> that's<00:00:50.640> falling<00:00:51.059> from

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
redirect the water that's falling from

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.500 
redirect the water that's falling from
one<00:00:51.510> pot<00:00:51.780> into<00:00:52.739> another<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
one pot into another and you use the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.350 
one pot into another and you use the
tools<00:00:54.809> of<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.199> ciders<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:56.010> do<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.430> you<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
tools of the ciders to do this you just

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.189 
tools of the ciders to do this you just
move<00:00:57.719> them<00:00:57.899> into<00:00:58.020> place<00:00:58.340> rotate<00:00:59.340> them<00:00:59.850> and

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
move them into place rotate them and

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.590 
move them into place rotate them and
hopefully<00:01:01.199> you'll<00:01:02.100> find<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.820> water<00:01:03.030> follows

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
hopefully you'll find the water follows

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.440 
hopefully you'll find the water follows
the<00:01:03.809> path<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.260> want<00:01:04.470> it<00:01:04.710> to<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.760> course<00:01:05.970> it's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
the path you want it to of course it's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.120 
the path you want it to of course it's
very<00:01:06.630> easy<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.229> first<00:01:07.590> screen<00:01:07.770> although

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
very easy on this first screen although

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.250 
very easy on this first screen although
I<00:01:08.490> still<00:01:08.939> seem<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.299> you<00:01:09.390> making<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.780> bit<00:01:10.049> of<00:01:10.170> a

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
I still seem to you making a bit of a

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.350 
I still seem to you making a bit of a
mess<00:01:10.470> of<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.740> but<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.520> gets<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.939> lot<00:01:11.970> more

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
mess of it but it gets a lot more

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.289 
mess of it but it gets a lot more
difficult<00:01:13.200> as<00:01:13.380> you<00:01:13.650> move<00:01:13.950> through<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.640> 50

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
difficult as you move through the 50

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.679 
difficult as you move through the 50
levels<00:01:15.900> that<00:01:16.680> not<00:01:16.950> only<00:01:17.130> throw<00:01:17.850> up<00:01:18.030> lots<00:01:18.479> of

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
levels that not only throw up lots of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.039 
levels that not only throw up lots of
complicated<00:01:19.290> maps<00:01:19.710> but<00:01:20.340> also<00:01:20.700> strange<00:01:21.689> new

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
complicated maps but also strange new

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.140 
complicated maps but also strange new
tools<00:01:22.380> all<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:23.100> which<00:01:23.280> have<00:01:23.549> their<00:01:23.909> own

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
tools all of which have their own

tools all of which have their own
features<00:01:24.869> on<00:01:25.049> this<00:01:25.560> level<00:01:25.920> for<00:01:26.130> example<00:01:26.189> you

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
features on this level for example you

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.510 
features on this level for example you
have<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:27.240> sponge<00:01:27.900> that<00:01:28.380> soaks<00:01:29.070> up<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> water

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
have a sponge that soaks up the water

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.499 
have a sponge that soaks up the water
and<00:01:30.090> drips<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> out<00:01:31.110> at<00:01:31.560> its<00:01:31.770> midpoint<00:01:32.509> it's

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
and drips it out at its midpoint it's

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.830 
and drips it out at its midpoint it's
great<00:01:34.020> fun<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.680> takes<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:35.400> lot<00:01:35.909> of<00:01:35.939> thought<00:01:36.329> but

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
great fun it takes a lot of thought but

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
great fun it takes a lot of thought but
it's<00:01:37.530> very<00:01:37.829> easy<00:01:38.159> to<00:01:38.430> pick<00:01:38.579> up<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:38.909> put<00:01:39.060> down

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
it's very easy to pick up and put down

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.260 
it's very easy to pick up and put down
you<00:01:39.570> can<00:01:39.750> save<00:01:40.110> your<00:01:40.320> place<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:41.850> don't<00:01:42.060> have

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
you can save your place you don't have

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.410
