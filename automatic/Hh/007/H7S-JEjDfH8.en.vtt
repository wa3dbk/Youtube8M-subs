this contest just so everybody knows
this<00:02:57.440> was<00:02:57.680> something<00:02:57.890> that<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.250> DJ<00:02:58.580> came<00:02:58.790> up

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
this was something that a DJ came up

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.699 
this was something that a DJ came up
with<00:02:59.120> and<00:02:59.360> what<00:02:59.510> they<00:02:59.630> wanted<00:02:59.840> to<00:02:59.900> do<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.350> the

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
with and what they wanted to do and the

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.800 
with and what they wanted to do and the
reason<00:03:00.890> they<00:03:01.100> got<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.370> 21<00:03:01.850> restriction<00:03:02.780> on

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
reason they got the 21 restriction on

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.620 
reason they got the 21 restriction on
there<00:03:02.989> I<00:03:03.019> think<00:03:03.500> it's<00:03:04.340> because<00:03:04.519> it<00:03:04.970> is<00:03:05.150> Vegas

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
there I think it's because it is Vegas

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.180 
there I think it's because it is Vegas
and<00:03:05.810> for<00:03:06.019> those<00:03:06.140> of<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:06.410> who<00:03:06.470> haven't<00:03:06.650> been<00:03:07.010> to

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
and for those of you who haven't been to

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.910 
and for those of you who haven't been to
Vegas<00:03:07.549> you<00:03:08.239> can't<00:03:08.480> really<00:03:08.660> fully<00:03:09.019> experience

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:09.920 
Vegas you can't really fully experience

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.580 
Vegas you can't really fully experience
Vegas<00:03:10.340> unless<00:03:10.820> you're<00:03:11.000> 21<00:03:11.420> there's<00:03:12.320> gambling

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
Vegas unless you're 21 there's gambling

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.430 
Vegas unless you're 21 there's gambling
and<00:03:13.070> and<00:03:13.220> things<00:03:13.880> to<00:03:14.060> do<00:03:14.180> there<00:03:14.390> in<00:03:14.570> America

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
and and things to do there in America

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.140 
and and things to do there in America
you<00:03:15.470> got<00:03:15.620> to<00:03:15.739> be<00:03:15.799> 21<00:03:16.100> to<00:03:16.220> gamble<00:03:16.580> and<00:03:16.700> a<00:03:16.850> drink

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
you got to be 21 to gamble and a drink

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.660 
you got to be 21 to gamble and a drink
so<00:03:18.019> I'm<00:03:18.530> thinking<00:03:18.590> that's<00:03:19.100> probably<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:19.670 
so I'm thinking that's probably the

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.449 
so I'm thinking that's probably the
reasoning<00:03:20.150> behind<00:03:20.180> it<00:03:20.780> and<00:03:20.989> then<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.160> people

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
reasoning behind it and then the people

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.310 
reasoning behind it and then the people
in<00:03:22.519> America<00:03:23.000> are<00:03:23.030> saying<00:03:23.420> hey<00:03:23.630> what<00:03:23.900> about<00:03:23.930> us

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
in America are saying hey what about us

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:29.949 
in America are saying hey what about us
and<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:26.690> I<00:03:26.720> can't<00:03:27.530> I<00:03:27.799> can't<00:03:28.100> say<00:03:28.580> too<00:03:28.640> much<00:03:28.959> but

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
and I I can't I can't say too much but

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.720 
and I I can't I can't say too much but
what<00:03:30.140> I<00:03:30.170> can<00:03:30.440> say<00:03:30.470> is<00:03:30.769> it's<00:03:31.130> very<00:03:31.220> possible

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
what I can say is it's very possible

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.880 
what I can say is it's very possible
that<00:03:32.530> in<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.769> next<00:03:34.209> few<00:03:35.209> months<00:03:35.890> something

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
that in the next few months something

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.740 
that in the next few months something
