00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
pictures from any screen it is built

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.299 
pictures from any screen it is built
around<00:01:00.969> the<00:01:01.359> snapdragon<00:01:02.320> platform<00:01:02.739> the<00:01:02.920> s400

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
around the snapdragon platform the s400

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.220 
around the snapdragon platform the s400
so<00:01:03.820> that's<00:01:03.999> why<00:01:04.330> we<00:01:04.510> can<00:01:04.750> make<00:01:04.900> it<00:01:05.050> very

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:05.230 
so that's why we can make it very

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.100 
so that's why we can make it very
affordable<00:01:05.920> and<00:01:06.040> the<00:01:07.000> front<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.390> occupied

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
affordable and the front is occupied

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.150 
affordable and the front is occupied
mainly<00:01:08.590> by<00:01:08.770> the<00:01:09.630> 5-inch<00:01:10.630> screen<00:01:10.980> so<00:01:11.980> that's

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:12.160 
mainly by the 5-inch screen so that's

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.940 
mainly by the 5-inch screen so that's
