00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:39.190 
so you need the crystal applicator tool

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:40.950 
so you need the crystal applicator tool
and<00:00:39.519> that's<00:00:39.699> what<00:00:39.879> you<00:00:39.969> see<00:00:40.149> here<00:00:40.510> and<00:00:40.659> it's<00:00:40.839> a

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:45.399 
weight to it that's not so heavy I'm not

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.129 
weight to it that's not so heavy I'm not
the<00:00:45.639> strongest<00:00:45.909> person<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.569> the<00:00:46.659> world<00:00:46.839> and<00:00:47.079> I

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:53.769 
specifically made for these buttons and

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:55.469 
specifically made for these buttons and
you<00:00:54.219> can<00:00:54.249> see<00:00:54.579> that<00:00:54.850> you're<00:00:55.149> going<00:00:55.299> to<00:00:55.359> get

00:00:59.699 --> 00:00:59.709 
die and that's actually going to slip

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:03.000 
die and that's actually going to slip
right<00:00:59.920> in<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:01.719> the<00:01:01.870> base<00:01:02.109> part<00:01:02.559> of<00:01:02.769> your

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:03.010 
right in to the base part of your

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.249 
right in to the base part of your
crystal<00:01:03.370> applicator<00:01:03.549> tool<00:01:04.149> and<00:01:04.479> then<00:01:05.110> you're

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:05.259 
crystal applicator tool and then you're

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:07.350 
crystal applicator tool and then you're
just<00:01:05.379> going<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:05.770> tighten<00:01:06.100> the<00:01:06.759> little<00:01:07.000> screw

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.360 
just going to tighten the little screw

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.560 
just going to tighten the little screw
until<00:01:08.009> it's<00:01:09.009> locked<00:01:09.310> in<00:01:09.490> there<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.880> secure

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.570 
until it's locked in there and secure

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.310 
until it's locked in there and secure
and<00:01:10.810> then<00:01:11.619> you're<00:01:11.740> going<00:01:11.860> to<00:01:11.950> get<00:01:12.039> to<00:01:12.369> top<00:01:12.700> dies

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
and then you're going to get to top dies

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.749 
and then you're going to get to top dies
so<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.619> the<00:01:14.770> backside<00:01:14.950> they<00:01:15.430> look<00:01:15.609> identical

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
so on the backside they look identical

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:17.849 
so on the backside they look identical
and<00:01:16.390> that's<00:01:16.630> going<00:01:16.780> to<00:01:16.840> fit<00:01:17.079> into<00:01:17.259> this<00:01:17.560> top

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:17.859 
and that's going to fit into this top

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:20.490 
and that's going to fit into this top
piece<00:01:18.130> up<00:01:18.399> here<00:01:18.729> but<00:01:19.600> on<00:01:19.810> the<00:01:20.020> front<00:01:20.259> side

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
piece up here but on the front side

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.649 
piece up here but on the front side
you'll<00:01:20.799> notice<00:01:21.039> you<00:01:21.130> have<00:01:21.189> two<00:01:21.460> sizes<00:01:21.969> you

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
you'll notice you have two sizes you

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.039 
you'll notice you have two sizes you
have<00:01:22.689> one<00:01:23.049> for<00:01:23.799> the<00:01:23.859> smaller<00:01:24.189> buttons<00:01:24.899> you<00:01:25.899> see

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
have one for the smaller buttons you see

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.410 
have one for the smaller buttons you see
how<00:01:26.170> that<00:01:26.350> fits<00:01:26.619> in<00:01:26.770> there<00:01:26.920> perfectly<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.640> one

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:28.420 
how that fits in there perfectly and one

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.620 
how that fits in there perfectly and one
for<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.259> larger<00:01:29.679> buttons<00:01:30.329> so<00:01:31.329> what<00:01:31.479> you're

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
for the larger buttons so what you're

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.200 
for the larger buttons so what you're
going<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.869> do<00:01:32.079> is<00:01:32.789> I'm<00:01:33.789> going<00:01:33.820> to<00:01:33.969> show<00:01:34.030> you<00:01:34.119> how

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
going to do is I'm going to show you how

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.789 
going to do is I'm going to show you how
to<00:01:34.270> apply<00:01:34.420> a<00:01:34.570> large<00:01:34.869> one<00:01:35.140> but<00:01:35.170> it<00:01:35.409> be<00:01:35.469> the<00:01:35.590> same

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to apply a large one but it be the same

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:38.999 
to apply a large one but it be the same
exact<00:01:36.219> method<00:01:36.640> for<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.880> smaller<00:01:37.179> one<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.890> you're

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:39.009 
exact method for a smaller one so you're

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:41.669 
exact method for a smaller one so you're
going<00:01:39.130> to<00:01:39.189> take<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.759> die<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:41.200> you're<00:01:41.560> going

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:41.679 
going to take the die and you're going

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:43.080 
going to take the die and you're going
to<00:01:41.740> take<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.039> end<00:01:42.310> with<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.670> smaller<00:01:42.999> hole

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
to take the end with the smaller hole

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.279 
to take the end with the smaller hole
and<00:01:43.630> put<00:01:44.590> it<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:45.249> the<00:01:45.729> shaft<00:01:45.969> here<00:01:46.509> you<00:01:47.109> see

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
and put it on to the shaft here you see

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:48.569 
and put it on to the shaft here you see
how<00:01:47.380> there's<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.590> little<00:01:47.679> indent<00:01:48.159> right<00:01:48.249> here

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:48.579 
how there's a little indent right here

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.239 
how there's a little indent right here
slide<00:01:49.270> it<00:01:49.299> all<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.929> way<00:01:50.049> up<00:01:50.079> over<00:01:50.679> that<00:01:50.770> indent

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
slide it all the way up over that indent

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.550 
slide it all the way up over that indent
and<00:01:51.880> you'll<00:01:52.060> actually<00:01:52.240> hear<00:01:52.630> it<00:01:52.780> almost<00:01:53.109> click

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:53.560 
and you'll actually hear it almost click

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.260 
and you'll actually hear it almost click
you'll<00:01:53.770> hear<00:01:54.009> it<00:01:54.130> kind<00:01:54.579> of<00:01:54.670> lock<00:01:54.820> into<00:01:54.999> place
