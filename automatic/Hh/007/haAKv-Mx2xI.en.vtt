00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
they're all these extra factors that

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.399 
they're all these extra factors that
make<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.850> a<00:01:36.030> 24-hour<00:01:36.450> race<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.140> that's<00:01:37.259> what

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
make up a 24-hour race and that's what

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.810 
make up a 24-hour race and that's what
makes<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.710> such<00:01:37.890> a<00:01:38.009> challenge<00:01:38.369> for<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.579> teams

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
makes it such a challenge for the teams

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.300 
makes it such a challenge for the teams
and<00:01:39.119> for<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.479> drivers<00:01:39.920> another<00:01:40.920> factor<00:01:41.280> to

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
and for the drivers another factor to

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.649 
and for the drivers another factor to
bear<00:01:41.549> in<00:01:41.700> mind<00:01:41.729> even<00:01:42.090> though<00:01:42.329> it's<00:01:42.450> sun

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
bear in mind even though it's sun

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.450 
bear in mind even though it's sun
shining<00:01:42.930> now<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.439> that<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:43.890> race<00:01:44.189> there

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
shining now is that for the race there

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.399 
shining now is that for the race there
is<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.670> forecast<00:01:44.850> of<00:01:45.270> rain<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.899> could<00:01:46.140> start

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
is the forecast of rain it could start

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:48.200 
is the forecast of rain it could start
in<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> wet<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.340> teams<00:01:47.579> will<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.790> had<00:01:47.970> no

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
in the wet the teams will have had no

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.539 
in the wet the teams will have had no
wet<00:01:48.509> running<00:01:48.990> up<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.409> that<00:01:49.740> point<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.280> that's

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
wet running up to that point and that's

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.920 
wet running up to that point and that's
going<00:01:50.790> to<00:01:50.850> make<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.119> very<00:01:51.299> difficult<00:01:51.540> indeed

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
going to make it very difficult indeed

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
going to make it very difficult indeed
because<00:01:52.409> they<00:01:52.500> won't<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.890> know<00:01:53.159> how<00:01:53.549> to

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
because they won't really know how to

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.760 
because they won't really know how to
treat<00:01:53.880> the<00:01:54.000> cars<00:01:54.210> how<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.540> treat<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.200> track<00:01:55.530> in

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
treat the cars how to treat the track in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.620 
treat the cars how to treat the track in
those<00:01:56.340> conditions<00:01:56.579> so<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> real<00:01:57.360> step

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
those conditions so it's a real step

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.990 
those conditions so it's a real step
into<00:01:57.930> the<00:01:58.020> unknown<00:01:58.049> with<00:01:58.619> such<00:01:59.430> a<00:01:59.460> big<00:01:59.729> grid

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.060 
into the unknown with such a big grid
