00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
he's preparing himself and he might

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:03.860 
he's preparing himself and he might
start<00:03:02.280> to<00:03:02.430> attack<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:02.910> and<00:03:03.180> because<00:03:03.720> he's<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
start to attack you and because he's a

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
ranger in the majority of them are you

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.259 
ranger in the majority of them are you
will<00:03:06.630> figure<00:03:06.989> out<00:03:07.110> that<00:03:07.500> using<00:03:08.220> prayer<00:03:08.970> from

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
will figure out that using prayer from

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.960 
will figure out that using prayer from
range<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.959> lot<00:03:10.680> easier<00:03:10.950> it<00:03:11.430> reduces<00:03:11.700> his

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
range is a lot easier it reduces his

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.910 
range is a lot easier it reduces his
hits<00:03:12.209> in<00:03:12.360> half<00:03:12.540> which<00:03:12.780> allows<00:03:13.079> you<00:03:13.319> better

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
hits in half which allows you better

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.250 
hits in half which allows you better
chances<00:03:14.489> or<00:03:14.730> traveling<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.510> level<00:03:15.750> 30<00:03:15.959> of<00:03:16.140> the

double<00:05:24.289> so<00:05:24.949> I'm<00:05:25.279> just<00:05:25.430> guessing<00:05:25.610> here<00:05:25.909> no<00:05:26.090> you

00:05:26.499 --> 00:05:26.509 
double so I'm just guessing here no you

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.390 
double so I'm just guessing here no you
know<00:05:26.629> drop<00:05:26.990> rate<00:05:27.169> has<00:05:27.319> been<00:05:27.349> confirmed<00:05:27.830> just

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
know drop rate has been confirmed just

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.719 
know drop rate has been confirmed just
say<00:05:28.520> is<00:05:28.580> one<00:05:28.729> in<00:05:28.879> 500<00:05:29.089> you<00:05:29.960> will<00:05:30.169> notice<00:05:30.379> that

00:05:30.719 --> 00:05:30.729 
say is one in 500 you will notice that

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:33.550 
say is one in 500 you will notice that
getting<00:05:31.729> these<00:05:31.879> then<00:05:32.719> goes<00:05:32.930> down<00:05:33.080> to<00:05:33.229> one<00:05:33.440> in

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 
getting these then goes down to one in

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.040 
getting these then goes down to one in
250<00:05:34.250> so<00:05:34.969> that's<00:05:35.180> definitely<00:05:35.419> a<00:05:35.629> great<00:05:35.810> thing

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
250 so that's definitely a great thing

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:38.950 
250 so that's definitely a great thing
to<00:05:36.080> be<00:05:36.289> doing<00:05:36.529> um<00:05:37.150> but<00:05:38.150> sadly<00:05:38.569> there's<00:05:38.779> always

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
to be doing um but sadly there's always

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.450 
to be doing um but sadly there's always
a<00:05:39.050> risk<00:05:39.259> of<00:05:39.500> going<00:05:39.650> into<00:05:39.830> the<00:05:39.919> wilderness<00:05:40.099> and

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:52.400 
once I've seen one PK but all I did was

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.309 
once I've seen one PK but all I did was
a<00:05:52.580> run<00:05:52.819> self<00:05:53.150> and<00:05:53.389> I<00:05:53.779> used<00:05:53.930> my<00:05:54.020> own<00:05:54.169> little

00:05:54.309 --> 00:05:54.319 
a run self and I used my own little

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.510 
glory at level 30 of the wilderness and
I<00:05:56.539> was<00:05:56.719> safe<00:05:56.930> but<00:05:57.229> besides<00:05:57.620> that<00:05:57.740> I<00:05:58.099> haven't

00:05:58.510 --> 00:05:58.520 
I was safe but besides that I haven't
