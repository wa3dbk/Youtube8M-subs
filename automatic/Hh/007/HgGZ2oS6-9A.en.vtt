that<00:01:28.049> but<00:01:28.259> as<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.500> matter<00:01:28.650> what<00:01:29.009> we<00:01:29.250> do<00:01:29.460> now<00:01:29.700> from

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
that but as a matter what we do now from

that but as a matter what we do now from
this<00:01:30.060> point<00:01:30.299> we<00:01:30.420> can't<00:01:30.600> change<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.140> Roland

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
this point we can't change it Roland

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.179 
this point we can't change it Roland
what<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> day<00:01:32.549> yeah<00:01:33.479> it's<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.439> bit<00:01:34.740> heartbreaking

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
what a day yeah it's a bit heartbreaking

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.670 
what a day yeah it's a bit heartbreaking
really<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.030> we<00:01:36.659> covered<00:01:37.079> ourselves<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
really because we covered ourselves in

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.410 
really because we covered ourselves in
that<00:01:37.710> last<00:01:38.100> race<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.790> having<00:01:39.150> two

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that last race with having two

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.560 
that last race with having two
strategies<00:01:39.869> with<00:01:40.320> Greg<00:01:41.210> starting<00:01:42.210> on<00:01:42.360> one

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
strategies with Greg starting on one

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.899 
strategies with Greg starting on one
tire<00:01:42.810> at<00:01:43.049> Jamie<00:01:43.320> sodding<00:01:43.799> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> other<00:01:44.189> so

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
tire at Jamie sodding on the other so

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.639 
tire at Jamie sodding on the other so
that<00:01:44.939> come<00:01:45.420> what<00:01:45.570> may<00:01:45.780> we<00:01:45.810> had<00:01:46.110> somebody<00:01:46.350> up

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
that come what may we had somebody up

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
that come what may we had somebody up
there<00:01:46.680> and<00:01:47.399> that<00:01:47.460> strategy<00:01:48.090> got<00:01:48.360> ruined<00:01:48.600> by

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
there and that strategy got ruined by

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.830 
there and that strategy got ruined by
the<00:01:49.079> race<00:01:49.710> management<00:01:50.360> calling<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.479> safety

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
the race management calling the safety

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.200 
the race management calling the safety
car<00:01:52.020> incorrectly<00:01:52.649> at<00:01:52.799> who<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.189> pick<00:01:53.340> up<00:01:53.579> so

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
car incorrectly at who to pick up so

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.639 
car incorrectly at who to pick up so
they<00:01:54.420> took<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.720> win<00:01:54.869> away<00:01:55.110> from<00:01:55.170> Craig

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
they took the win away from Craig

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.740 
they took the win away from Craig
basically<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> think<00:01:56.969> Craig<00:01:57.210> would<00:01:57.450> have<00:01:57.570> been

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
basically I think Craig would have been

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.770 
basically I think Craig would have been
fairly<00:01:58.049> comfortable<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.740> that
