00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.180 
never been my gosh super close but you
know<00:02:03.180> maybe<00:02:03.420> 30<00:02:03.840> feet<00:02:04.050> away<00:02:04.200> it<00:02:04.590> was<00:02:04.710> close

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
know maybe 30 feet away it was close

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.400 
know maybe 30 feet away it was close
enough<00:02:05.220> kind<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.090> sharp<00:02:06.360> um<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:07.110> believe<00:02:07.380> that

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
enough kind of sharp um I believe that

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:09.469 
enough kind of sharp um I believe that
was<00:02:07.710> a<00:02:07.740> tiger<00:02:08.190> joy<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.670> don't<00:02:08.940> know<00:02:09.090> I<00:02:09.119> wasn't

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
was a tiger joy I don't know I wasn't

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.630 
was a tiger joy I don't know I wasn't
really<00:02:09.750> close<00:02:10.200> enough<00:02:10.590> to<00:02:10.860> see<00:02:11.130> but<00:02:11.430> I<00:02:11.460> was<00:02:11.610> in

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
really close enough to see but I was in

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.060 
really close enough to see but I was in
Hawaii<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.390> I'm<00:02:12.510> assuming<00:02:12.630> it<00:02:13.380> look<00:02:13.650> from<00:02:13.950> a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
Hawaii so I'm assuming it look from a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.010 
Hawaii so I'm assuming it look from a
distance<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.700> this<00:02:14.820> time<00:02:15.030> shot<00:02:15.270> when<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.600> see

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
distance in this time shot when you see

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:17.840 
distance in this time shot when you see
a<00:02:16.050> shark<00:02:16.380> what<00:02:16.680> do<00:02:16.740> you<00:02:16.860> immediately<00:02:17.100> do<00:02:17.610> just

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
a shark what do you immediately do just

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.490 
a shark what do you immediately do just
paddle<00:02:18.180> towards<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.540> shore<00:02:18.780> get<00:02:19.230> out<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.440> the

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
paddle towards the shore get out of the

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.370 
paddle towards the shore get out of the
water<00:02:19.590> yeah<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.850> don't<00:02:21.030> like<00:02:21.780> pieces<00:02:22.200> like<00:02:22.350> a
