which<00:00:31.230> can<00:00:31.470> be<00:00:32.300> maybe<00:00:33.300> could<00:00:33.540> be<00:00:33.690> sort<00:00:33.960> of

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
which can be maybe could be sort of

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.410 
which can be maybe could be sort of
scary<00:00:34.440> hood<00:00:34.739> I<00:00:35.250> don't<00:00:35.760> know<00:00:35.880> it<00:00:36.090> looks<00:00:36.239> like<00:00:36.329> a

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
scary hood I don't know it looks like a

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.260 
scary hood I don't know it looks like a
lot<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> fun<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:40.309> really<00:00:41.309> like<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.059> one

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
lot of fun and I really like this one

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.750 
lot of fun and I really like this one
it's<00:00:42.510> called<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.870> unnamed<00:00:43.410> amphibious<00:00:44.370> but<00:00:44.670> I

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
it's called the unnamed amphibious but I

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.250 
it's called the unnamed amphibious but I
guess<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.149> means<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.690> did<00:00:45.870> name<00:00:46.079> it

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
guess that means that they did name it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.190 
guess that means that they did name it
didn't<00:00:46.500> they<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.280> Wow<00:00:47.820> what<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.360> going<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:48.930> with

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
didn't they so Wow what is going on with

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.750 
didn't they so Wow what is going on with
this<00:00:49.940> so<00:00:50.940> it<00:00:51.329> looks<00:00:51.600> like<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.899> driver<00:00:52.199> sits<00:00:52.760> in

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
this so it looks like the driver sits in

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.869 
this so it looks like the driver sits in
that<00:00:54.030> seat<00:00:54.090> over<00:00:54.660> there<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.230> they<00:00:56.010> can<00:00:56.280> steer

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
that seat over there and they can steer

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.900 
that seat over there and they can steer
with<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> little<00:00:57.719> that<00:00:58.230> little<00:00:58.260> wheel<00:00:58.949> that<00:00:59.850> is

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
with a little that little wheel that is

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.180 
with a little that little wheel that is
to<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.480> right<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.989> by<00:01:01.230> just<00:01:01.469> rotating<00:01:02.129> it

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
to the right of them by just rotating it

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.250 
to the right of them by just rotating it
like<00:01:02.430> this<00:01:02.699> or<00:01:02.940> like<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.840> they're

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
like this or like that and they're

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.380 
like this or like that and they're
actually<00:01:04.439> using<00:01:04.650> bike<00:01:05.430> chains<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:06.000> do<00:01:06.150> that

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
actually using bike chains to do that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.980 
actually using bike chains to do that
over<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.610> it's<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:09.510> they<00:01:09.630> steer<00:01:09.900> it

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
over here and it's that they steer it

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.289 
over here and it's that they steer it
like<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> trike<00:01:10.590> except<00:01:11.340> the<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.490> steering<00:01:12.210> is

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
like a trike except the the steering is

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.230 
like a trike except the the steering is
in<00:01:12.450> is<00:01:13.020> in<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.380> back<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.860> then<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.909> can<00:01:14.939> also

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
in is in the back and then you can also

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.440 
in is in the back and then you can also
have<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:16.110> folks<00:01:16.409> in<00:01:16.680> front<00:01:17.159> pedal<00:01:18.090> as<00:01:18.240> well

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
have two folks in front pedal as well

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
have two folks in front pedal as well
these<00:01:19.049> are<00:01:19.110> really<00:01:19.590> neat<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:20.040> mean<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.400> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
these are really neat I mean this is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210 
these are really neat I mean this is
just<00:01:21.200> you<00:01:22.200> know<00:01:22.229> what<00:01:22.439> this<00:01:22.560> comes<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:23.009> it

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
just you know what this comes from it

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.789 
just you know what this comes from it
comes<00:01:23.700> from<00:01:23.810> having<00:01:24.810> having<00:01:25.259> a<00:01:25.439> bunch<00:01:25.650> of

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
comes from having having a bunch of

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
comes from having having a bunch of
bikes<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.400> hand<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.439> just<00:01:28.439> taking<00:01:28.710> them<00:01:28.890> apart

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
bikes on hand and just taking them apart

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.530 
bikes on hand and just taking them apart
and<00:01:29.430> welding<00:01:29.729> them<00:01:29.880> back<00:01:30.030> together<00:01:30.270> and

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
and welding them back together and

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.690 
and welding them back together and
figuring<00:01:31.079> out<00:01:31.200> how<00:01:31.259> you<00:01:31.530> can<00:01:31.950> combine<00:01:32.189> them

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
figuring out how you can combine them

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.370 
figuring out how you can combine them
how<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.090> can<00:01:33.299> change<00:01:33.600> them<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.079> stuff<00:01:34.259> like

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
how you can change them and stuff like

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.530 
how you can change them and stuff like
that<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.829> you<00:01:35.549> know<00:01:35.670> Thomas<00:01:36.119> Edison<00:01:36.509> said

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
that and you know Thomas Edison said

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.630 
that and you know Thomas Edison said
that<00:01:36.990> to<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.229> an<00:01:37.320> inventor<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.979> you<00:01:38.159> need<00:01:38.340> is

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
that to be an inventor all you need is

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.399 
that to be an inventor all you need is
is<00:01:39.299> a<00:01:39.750> good<00:01:40.049> imagination<00:01:40.290> and<00:01:40.920> a<00:01:40.950> pile<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.369> junk

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
is a good imagination and a pile of junk

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.950 
is a good imagination and a pile of junk
so<00:01:42.640> that<00:01:43.640> is<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:45.020> adage<00:01:45.679> in<00:01:46.420> progress<00:01:47.420> right

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
so that is that adage in progress right

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.370 
so that is that adage in progress right
there<00:01:48.319> and<00:01:48.969> as<00:01:49.969> you<00:01:50.060> can<00:01:50.240> see<00:01:50.390> we<00:01:50.750> have<00:01:50.929> lots<00:01:51.170> of

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
there and as you can see we have lots of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.249 
there and as you can see we have lots of
different<00:01:51.500> bikes<00:01:51.950> and<00:01:52.810> actually<00:01:53.810> there<00:01:54.170> are

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
different bikes and actually there are

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.889 
different bikes and actually there are
just<00:01:54.380> a<00:01:54.530> lot<00:01:54.560> of<00:01:55.009> people<00:01:55.369> on<00:01:56.030> bikes<00:01:56.539> be

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
just a lot of people on bikes be

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.349 
just a lot of people on bikes be
different<00:01:57.380> kinds<00:01:57.679> of<00:01:57.740> vehicles<00:01:57.890> today<00:01:58.399> so<00:01:59.000> a

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359
