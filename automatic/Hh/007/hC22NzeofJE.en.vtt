going in the rip jigging going is so

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.320 
going in the rip jigging going is so
important<00:02:32.040> it's<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.580> know<00:02:32.670> more<00:02:32.940> important

this<00:02:40.170> time<00:02:40.350> of<00:02:40.500> year<00:02:40.620> because<00:02:40.770> they're

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
this time of year because they're

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
can't beat a jig in the middle something

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.949 
can't beat a jig in the middle something
to<00:02:53.130> take<00:02:53.970> into<00:02:54.000> consideration<00:02:54.209> when<00:02:54.870> you're

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
to take into consideration when you're

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.750 
to take into consideration when you're
targeting<00:02:55.170> bigger<00:02:55.680> walleye<00:02:56.010> is<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.430> look<00:02:56.549> for

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
targeting bigger walleye is to look for

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.240 
targeting bigger walleye is to look for
a<00:02:56.820> jig<00:02:57.060> that<00:02:57.090> has<00:02:57.360> a<00:02:57.660> nice<00:02:58.380> quality<00:02:58.680> strong

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
a jig that has a nice quality strong

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.530 
a jig that has a nice quality strong
hook<00:02:59.489> that's<00:02:59.670> not<00:02:59.820> going<00:02:59.970> to<00:03:00.030> bend<00:03:00.239> out<00:03:00.420> when

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
hook that's not going to bend out when

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.900 
hook that's not going to bend out when
you<00:03:00.600> do<00:03:00.690> hook<00:03:00.870> into<00:03:01.019> that<00:03:01.230> fish<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.500> a<00:03:01.590> lifetime

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
you do hook into that fish of a lifetime

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:04.190 
you do hook into that fish of a lifetime
exactly<00:03:02.910> because<00:03:03.000> it's<00:03:03.209> not<00:03:03.330> like<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.510> fluke

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
exactly because it's not like a fluke

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.509 
exactly because it's not like a fluke
chance<00:03:04.560> right<00:03:04.799> now<00:03:04.830> where<00:03:05.130> you're<00:03:05.280> targeting
