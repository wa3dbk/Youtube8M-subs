00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
again you can make it smaller and you're

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.270 
again you can make it smaller and you're
going<00:03:46.120> to<00:03:46.180> see<00:03:46.390> at<00:03:46.510> times<00:03:46.870> when<00:03:47.560> the<00:03:47.709> text<00:03:48.160> is

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.060 
going to see at times when the text is
not<00:03:48.880> as<00:03:49.090> much<00:03:49.300> it<00:03:49.540> will<00:03:49.660> automatically<00:03:50.440> get

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
not as much it will automatically get

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.820 
not as much it will automatically get
larger<00:03:51.550> and<00:03:51.730> smaller<00:03:52.030> as<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.810> go<00:03:53.050> now<00:03:53.620> you<00:03:53.680> can
