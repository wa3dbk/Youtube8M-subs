00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
you can hear people's footsteps from a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.020 
you can hear people's footsteps from a
mile<00:01:57.140> away<00:01:57.170> it's<00:01:57.770> like<00:01:57.830> wow<00:01:58.399> that's<00:01:58.670> a<00:01:58.850> good

comes with as you can see there's a
whole<00:04:17.410> bunch<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.680> wires<00:04:17.889> coming<00:04:18.220> out<00:04:18.400> of<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.609> so

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:18.850 
whole bunch of wires coming out of it so

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:21.240 
whole bunch of wires coming out of it so
the<00:04:18.880> name<00:04:19.299> doesn't<00:04:19.690> make<00:04:19.780> any<00:04:19.959> sense<00:04:20.250> but

source<00:04:28.180> now<00:04:28.479> what<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.229> did<00:04:29.500> the<00:04:29.590> power<00:04:29.800> of<00:04:29.889> this

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:30.010 
source now what I did the power of this

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.740 
source now what I did the power of this
is<00:04:30.190> I<00:04:30.280> just<00:04:30.520> plug<00:04:30.669> it<00:04:30.790> into<00:04:30.880> the<00:04:31.000> back<00:04:31.150> of<00:04:31.180> my<00:04:31.360> TV

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090 
that was the simplest way it comes with

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:37.469 
that was the simplest way it comes with

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
the charging USB cord and the coolest

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:38.580 
the charging USB cord and the coolest
thing<00:04:37.660> is<00:04:37.810> when<00:04:38.020> you're<00:04:38.139> not<00:04:38.200> using<00:04:38.410> the

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
thing is when you're not using the

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.529 
thing is when you're not using the
headphones<00:04:38.740> you<00:04:39.370> can<00:04:39.400> just<00:04:39.669> set<00:04:39.880> them<00:04:40.000> on<00:04:40.240> top

I didn't mind them hugging the side of

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.710 
I didn't mind them hugging the side of
my<00:05:57.230> head<00:05:57.440> for<00:05:57.620> three<00:05:57.860> hours<00:05:58.010> but<00:05:58.820> the<00:05:59.030> price<00:05:59.420> I

00:05:59.710 --> 00:05:59.720 
my head for three hours but the price I

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.440 
my head for three hours but the price I
just<00:05:59.750> can't<00:06:00.230> justify<00:06:00.320> a<00:06:00.860> $300<00:06:01.580> price<00:06:01.910> tag<00:06:02.210> for

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
just can't justify a $300 price tag for

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:03.940 
just can't justify a $300 price tag for
these<00:06:02.600> headphones<00:06:02.840> if<00:06:03.410> you<00:06:03.530> can<00:06:03.680> find<00:06:03.860> the
