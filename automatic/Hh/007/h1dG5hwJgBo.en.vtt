more<00:01:15.600> Chris<00:01:16.310> I<00:01:17.310> want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> say<00:01:17.850> it's<00:01:18.150> almost<00:01:18.509> a

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
more Chris I want to say it's almost a

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.960 
more Chris I want to say it's almost a
little<00:01:19.530> spongy<00:01:20.490> err<00:01:20.520> a<00:01:20.580> little<00:01:20.820> more

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
little spongy err a little more

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.560 
little spongy err a little more
indefinite<00:01:21.570> than<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.710> tap<00:01:22.860> Cody<00:01:23.189> -<00:01:23.360> but<00:01:24.360> I

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
indefinite than the the tap Cody - but I

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.630 
indefinite than the the tap Cody - but I
feel<00:01:24.960> like<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.350> lighter<00:01:25.710> than<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.100> tab<00:01:26.280> go<00:01:26.460> G

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
feel like it's lighter than the tab go G

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.789 
feel like it's lighter than the tab go G
-<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.600> it's<00:01:27.900> kind<00:01:28.049> of<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.170> trade-off<00:01:28.380> as<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.680> what

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
- so it's kind of a trade-off as to what

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.380 
- so it's kind of a trade-off as to what
you<00:01:28.890> prefer<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.520> a<00:01:29.549> slightly<00:01:30.150> heavier

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
you prefer to have a slightly heavier

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.649 
you prefer to have a slightly heavier
trigger<00:01:30.869> with<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.890> like<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.820> crisp<00:01:33.270> let<00:01:33.479> off

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
trigger with a like very crisp let off

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.499 
trigger with a like very crisp let off
or<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> slightly<00:01:34.890> spongy<00:01:35.189> err<00:01:35.549> lighter<00:01:36.240> trigger

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
or a slightly spongy err lighter trigger

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:39.410 
or a slightly spongy err lighter trigger
personally<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.590> like<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.220> slightly<00:01:39.210> lighter

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
personally I like this slightly lighter

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.100 
personally I like this slightly lighter
one<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> think<00:01:39.840> it's<00:01:39.990> kind<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.200> nice<00:01:40.380> and<00:01:41.280> I

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.780 
one I think it's kind of nice and I
didn't<00:01:43.110> like<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.439> immediate<00:01:43.979> improvement<00:01:44.520> of

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
didn't like an immediate improvement of

didn't like an immediate improvement of
my<00:01:44.850> groupings<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.360> anything<00:01:45.509> crazy<00:01:45.990> like<00:01:46.110> that

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
my groupings or anything crazy like that

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.700 
my groupings or anything crazy like that
but<00:01:46.710> I<00:01:46.740> I<00:01:47.100> fight<00:01:47.579> about<00:01:47.790> 75<00:01:48.479> rounds<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.560> gun

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
the only thing that's interesting about

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.709 
the only thing that's interesting about
the<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.430> trigger<00:02:02.700> right<00:02:02.939> is<00:02:03.270> the

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the the trigger right is the

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.660 
the the trigger right is the
installation<00:02:04.200> is<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.770> giant<00:02:05.189> pain<00:02:05.340> in<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.520> ass

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
installation is a giant pain in the ass

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.240 
installation is a giant pain in the ass
and<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:05.969> know<00:02:06.149> all<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.719> KA<00:02:06.930> trigger<00:02:07.259> work<00:02:07.979> is<00:02:08.220> a

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and I know all a KA trigger work is a

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.859 
and I know all a KA trigger work is a
pain<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.670> ass<00:02:08.849> to<00:02:09.090> some<00:02:09.209> extent<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:09.720> it's

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:09.869 
pain in the ass to some extent but it's

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.059 
pain in the ass to some extent but it's
especially<00:02:10.289> so<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.649> you<00:02:10.739> don't<00:02:10.890> have<00:02:11.009> the

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
especially so if you don't have the

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.290 
especially so if you don't have the
right<00:02:11.220> tools<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:12.239> don't<00:02:12.599> have<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> pay

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
right tools I don't have a pay

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.710 
right tools I don't have a pay
of<00:02:13.510> of<00:02:14.200> proper<00:02:14.620> vice<00:02:14.830> grips<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.370> I<00:02:16.240> had<00:02:16.390> to<00:02:16.480> use

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
of of proper vice grips so I had to use

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.710 
of of proper vice grips so I had to use
like<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.920> like<00:02:18.250> a<00:02:18.280> painters<00:02:18.640> clamp<00:02:19.000> which<00:02:19.600> does

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
like a like a painters clamp which does

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.160 
like a like a painters clamp which does
not<00:02:19.960> work<00:02:20.250> at<00:02:21.250> all<00:02:21.460> and<00:02:21.810> so<00:02:22.810> I<00:02:22.870> end<00:02:22.990> up<00:02:23.020> having

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
not work at all and so I end up having

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.420 
not work at all and so I end up having
just<00:02:23.410> a<00:02:23.470> white<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:23.860> up<00:02:23.950> little<00:02:24.160> thing<00:02:24.280> with<00:02:24.400> a

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
just a white and up little thing with a

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.560 
just a white and up little thing with a
pair<00:02:24.670> of<00:02:24.700> needle<00:02:24.940> nose<00:02:25.150> pliers<00:02:26.160> holding<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
pair of needle nose pliers holding the

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.100 
pair of needle nose pliers holding the
the<00:02:28.570> hammer<00:02:28.840> Springs<00:02:30.540> hooked<00:02:31.540> around<00:02:31.930> the

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
the hammer Springs hooked around the

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.950 
the hammer Springs hooked around the
pliers<00:02:32.350> and<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.850> think<00:02:34.150> it<00:02:34.240> drew<00:02:34.540> blood<00:02:34.840> on

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:34.960 
pliers and it I think it drew blood on

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:36.330 
pliers and it I think it drew blood on
me<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.260> four<00:02:35.500> times<00:02:35.800> during<00:02:36.190> the

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
me like four times during the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.490 
me like four times during the
installation<00:02:36.840> it's<00:02:37.840> not<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.290> difficult

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 
installation it's not that difficult

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.230 
installation it's not that difficult
with<00:02:38.860> the<00:02:38.950> right<00:02:39.160> tools<00:02:39.460> because<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.790> later

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
with the right tools because I later

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.020 
with the right tools because I later
helped<00:02:40.480> the<00:02:40.600> buddy<00:02:40.780> install<00:02:41.140> his<00:02:41.460> with<00:02:42.460> his

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
helped the buddy install his with his

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.870 
helped the buddy install his with his
set<00:02:43.330> of<00:02:43.740> vise<00:02:44.740> grips<00:02:45.070> and<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.520> really

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
set of vise grips and it was really

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.160 
set of vise grips and it was really
really<00:02:46.270> easy<00:02:46.360> and<00:02:46.780> I<00:02:46.810> felt<00:02:47.020> really<00:02:47.050> stupid<00:02:47.470> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
really easy and I felt really stupid so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.840 
really easy and I felt really stupid so
where<00:02:50.170> do<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.380> Y's<00:02:50.560> have<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:51.340> tools<00:02:51.610> they

where do the Y's have the tools they

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.430 
where do the Y's have the tools they
recommend<00:02:52.330> on<00:02:52.420> the<00:02:52.510> box<00:02:52.720> with<00:02:52.990> the<00:02:53.080> exception

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
of a punch you don't really need a punch

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.170 
of a punch you don't really need a punch
you<00:02:56.320> might<00:02:56.620> if<00:02:56.800> your<00:02:56.950> guns<00:02:57.190> kind<00:02:57.490> of<00:02:57.580> stiff<00:02:57.910> I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
you might if your guns kind of stiff I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.110 
you might if your guns kind of stiff I
actually<00:02:59.020> just<00:02:59.380> I<00:02:59.800> pushed<00:03:00.340> out<00:03:00.550> the<00:03:00.580> trigger

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
actually just I pushed out the trigger

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.990 
actually just I pushed out the trigger
pin<00:03:01.360> and<00:03:02.430> once<00:03:03.430> I<00:03:03.490> had<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.670> trigger<00:03:03.910> pin

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
pin and once I had the trigger pin

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.790 
pin and once I had the trigger pin
pushed<00:03:04.270> out<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.450> used<00:03:04.780> that<00:03:04.900> pin<00:03:05.200> as<00:03:05.380> a<00:03:05.410> punch

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
pushed out I used that pin as a punch

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.440 
pushed out I used that pin as a punch
for<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.040> other<00:03:06.130> one<00:03:06.310> I<00:03:06.520> didn't<00:03:07.060> have<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.240> hit

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
for the other one I didn't have to hit

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:08.700 
for the other one I didn't have to hit
it<00:03:07.570> with<00:03:07.660> a<00:03:07.690> hammer<00:03:07.900> I<00:03:08.080> just<00:03:08.320> kind<00:03:08.500> of<00:03:08.530> hit<00:03:08.650> it

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
it with a hammer I just kind of hit it

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:09.810 
it with a hammer I just kind of hit it
with<00:03:08.800> my<00:03:08.920> palm<00:03:09.130> because<00:03:09.460> it<00:03:09.610> was<00:03:09.730> already

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
with my palm because it was already

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.180 
with my palm because it was already
pretty<00:03:10.240> pretty<00:03:10.660> loose<00:03:10.920> and<00:03:11.920> once<00:03:12.040> you've

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
pretty pretty loose and once you've

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.560 
pretty pretty loose and once you've
taken<00:03:12.310> all<00:03:12.520> the<00:03:12.580> spring<00:03:12.850> pressure<00:03:12.970> off<00:03:13.300> those

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
taken all the spring pressure off those

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:16.440 
taken all the spring pressure off those
pins<00:03:13.930> they<00:03:14.170> slide<00:03:14.620> out<00:03:14.650> fairly<00:03:15.130> easily<00:03:15.450> the

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
pins they slide out fairly easily the

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:17.820 
pins they slide out fairly easily the
Shepherd's<00:03:16.780> hook<00:03:16.870> was<00:03:17.020> not<00:03:17.170> bad<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.500> install

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
Shepherd's hook was not bad to install

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.170 
Shepherd's hook was not bad to install
there's<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.489> instructions<00:03:18.910> that<00:03:18.970> come<00:03:19.120> with

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
there's the instructions that come with

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.760 
there's the instructions that come with
the<00:03:19.330> gun<00:03:19.510> are<00:03:19.660> pretty<00:03:19.870> good<00:03:20.020> or<00:03:20.200> the<00:03:20.290> trigger

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:20.770 
the gun are pretty good or the trigger

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.770 
the gun are pretty good or the trigger
rather<00:03:21.090> there's<00:03:22.090> there's<00:03:22.360> I<00:03:22.480> think<00:03:22.540> there's

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:22.780 
rather there's there's I think there's

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:24.870 
rather there's there's I think there's
10<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.170> so<00:03:23.290> pictures<00:03:23.770> they<00:03:24.430> aren't<00:03:24.700> black<00:03:24.820> and

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
10 or so pictures they aren't black and

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.729 
10 or so pictures they aren't black and
white<00:03:25.090> but<00:03:25.570> they<00:03:25.720> are<00:03:25.840> nice<00:03:26.050> and<00:03:26.110> zoomed<00:03:26.500> in<00:03:26.709> so

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
white but they are nice and zoomed in so

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:28.140 
white but they are nice and zoomed in so
you<00:03:26.920> can<00:03:27.100> really<00:03:27.130> see<00:03:27.489> what<00:03:27.760> they're<00:03:27.820> talking

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.150 
you can really see what they're talking

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.810 
you can really see what they're talking
about<00:03:28.209> and<00:03:28.989> it<00:03:29.140> took<00:03:29.410> me<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.620> don't<00:03:29.830> know<00:03:29.920> 20

about and it took me I don't know 20
minutes<00:03:30.850> to<00:03:31.180> install<00:03:31.300> should<00:03:31.959> have<00:03:32.050> been<00:03:32.140> like

it's<00:03:58.600> a<00:03:58.630> pretty<00:03:58.750> good<00:03:58.930> investment<00:03:59.410> I<00:03:59.440> think

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
it's a pretty good investment I think

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:01.920 
it's a pretty good investment I think
it's<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.830> it's<00:04:00.280> a<00:04:00.340> good<00:04:00.550> a<00:04:00.940> good<00:04:01.540> part<00:04:01.840> to

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
it's a it's a good a good part to

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:03.990 
it's a it's a good a good part to
upgrade<00:04:02.290> so<00:04:02.440> I<00:04:02.470> think<00:04:02.620> it's<00:04:02.709> one<00:04:02.830> of<00:04:02.860> the<00:04:03.010> AKS

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
upgrade so I think it's one of the AKS

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.360 
upgrade so I think it's one of the AKS
biggest<00:04:04.420> drawbacks<00:04:04.870> is<00:04:05.050> that<00:04:05.170> trigger<00:04:05.440> second
