00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.360
 lonely cave grave 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.039
 okay what do I give the map the map the 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.270
 definitely gets a good note 

00:04:51.039 --> 00:04:52.629
 because they are really pretty good 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.389
 was 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:56.650
 Although there were twice though it was 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.930
 yes not two man christ it was one 

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.370
 do not remember what 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:03.879
 I've rarely seen it 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:05.409
 that you have to remember something then 

00:05:03.879 --> 00:05:06.280
 there was a jump'n'run that was not 

00:05:05.409 --> 00:05:09.340
 so hard 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.379
 that was because that dream come true, the 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:13.479
 Brings in a bit of framerate 

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:15.120
 Without recording , space is determined 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:17.710
 been really easy 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.330
 there was still a cool story and if so 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.310
 is now continuing august and 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:23.349
 longer but considering several maps 

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.759
 for a pretty good thing the 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:27.150
 describes the new feature in the books 

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:29.500
 was at least used 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:31.539
 What there was, I just think about me 

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.190
 Construct degree 'rooms were two 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:38.680
 Quiz about minecraft from yes one 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.120
 very nice idea of the single with the 

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.280
 throw a little bit so 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:44.889
 abilities were required from the what 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:49.289
 There was still the superior confidence 4 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:49.289
 was on the 4th 

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:57.190
 I do not know, I really do not know 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.690
 no matter in any case, the story finished 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.740
 just fine then afterwards but killed 

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.889
 that's just going to go on and on 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:07.270
 further and that the boy named germany 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:09.099
 then hopefully now even the 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.380
 save the world 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.330
 and yes I would say there is nothing 2+ 

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:15.279
 which is actually quite good for me but for 

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:19.180
 for example the matching same adventure 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:20.620
 I liked web better somehow 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.270
 we were the ones left 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:25.360
 better and was still behind elaborate 

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:27.219
 and they have just the 1 - or the 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:29.349
 then once earned and that's why you are 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:30.699
 now 2 + I just have to wait until the 

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:32.080
 series is complete when the series 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:33.430
 probably a complete is one 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.840
 the series probably complete 

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:36.219
 Proven and if the series really like that 

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.990
 good is probably the continue 

00:06:36.219 --> 00:06:39.400
 complete web series the seven web pages 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:39.900
 seen together maybe a one 

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:42.130
 minus 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:44.800
 yes, but we would just have a look 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.759
 first time a 2+ and say many 

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:46.919
 thanks for seeing i hope that i will 

00:06:45.759 --> 00:06:49.919
 again a case until next time 

00:06:46.919 --> 00:06:49.919
