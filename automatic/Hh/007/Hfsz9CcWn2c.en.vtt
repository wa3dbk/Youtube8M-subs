00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.930
 the problem is that when I smear 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.810

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.800

 every blogger shows her not to go 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.489
 but I am not an exception in the end 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.920
 this is a distress its own mask with salts 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.040

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.210

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.189
 if you can say so she and and 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.380
 refreshes and you're just the next mask 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.880
 cucumber mask seems to me even here 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.700
 say nothing because all 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.650
 know and everyone tried it awesome 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.170
 Naturally no more than 2 times a week and 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.450
 I think after applying the makeup fee 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.060
 clears awesome rip off plenochkoj 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.990
 just mars next mask or rather 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.970
 Sare face scrub as we all know scrub 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.490
 for the face more than two times a week we are not 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.909
 use because it damages the skin and 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.229
 scrubber face is still necessary therefore 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:57.600
 we limit the length of the size 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.340
 all the usual cream in probably know 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.939
 when you apply dry skin 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.680
 they are fat as peps and again who then 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.259
 it wake up the next day 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.399
 your skin is again dry and nifiga 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:14.319
 nothing helps first in the world 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:19.829
 I found it with dry skin 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:23.230
 cream yaku moisturizing garnish 

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:26.109
 dry very dry skin it is real 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.739
 fucking awesome it is simple i don't know 

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:33.790
 even how to tell you but very cool 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:35.230
 I'm sorry but I hardly chose varnishes 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.840
 which I would not like to show you 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.180
 because every month I am a thousand times 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.870
 I spend money on huskies and I do not care because 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.440
 that i like them true today 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:51.959
 generally without a glimpse and so little varnishes 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:54.519
 my most favorite husky is catrice 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:03:00.939
 I love catrice I love catrice 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:04.299
 essence all this turbidity following two varnishes 

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:05.859
 from essense this company probably everyone knows 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:09.250
 means alloc nice brush comfortable 

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:13.750
 why not 2 acca completely different from 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:16.030
 I got some kind of infection literally 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:19.480
 of the month I am buying a lot of purple 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.370
 lilac flowers 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:27.280
 the series here is this dark lacquer from essense 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:33.940
 number and number which number number 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:36.669
 number 16 to 16 of this varnish is here 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.299
 Savina I hope the next varnish he too 

00:03:36.669 --> 00:03:39.790

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.650
 cool celadon but not very 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.849
 like a50 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.709
 the next varnish is also kickbacks and he too 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.599
 lilac pancake I don't know why everyone 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.560
 time never loved this color well in 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.239
 Generally what would not color just wow it 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.840
 probably the biggest favorite 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:01.750
 already throughout this month i 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.909
 I can't stop looking for it just for 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.010
 I have a very cool paw and then everything seems to be 

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:09.220

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:12.760

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.550
 I don’t know why pancake days but I don’t paint 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:31.970
 with shadows and here it brought me such 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.789
 I think I think I think I think such a damn thing 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:38.690
 need to buy something already understand that 

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:41.470
 unnecessary shadows I fucking pipets as needed 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.479

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:48.259
 catrice 1 to 3 of 2 

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:50.570
