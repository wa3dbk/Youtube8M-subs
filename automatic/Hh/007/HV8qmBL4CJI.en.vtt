00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.500
 people who have the original game as 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:15.070
 those that do not of the games of the hunger ' 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.980
 this server is super good I will leave you 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.409
 the ip in the description on this server 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:22.480
 we have on the one hand the spawn area of 

00:00:20.409 --> 00:00:24.369
 there in front and then on the other hand 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.429
 We have different areas in which 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.710
 we can read a little bit what things 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:32.770
 we can do then donate money if it is 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:37.030
 what we want or the rules that we have to 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.400
 follow who are vip etc and here 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.650
 behind me where I'm uploaded a 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:47.680
 new little we have the area of ​​sands in 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.520
 this area we have several floors if I do not 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:57.370
 There are five of them wrong and in those among all 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:01:00.129
 We have a total of 27 sands 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.230
 the sands have the posters for a 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.940
 side on the left sign that sand is 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.680
 that if we give the right button 

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.440
 we directly enter in the case that 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.409
 is waiting or we are waiting as 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.570
 that from above like sand 25 in this 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:16.360
 case on the other hand we have the ones that are 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.820
 in game that in that case we can not 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.710
 enter because people are playing and 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.320
 in and for example those that are in game 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.170
 we see that it has some numbers there 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.330
 some names in black and others in gray 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.550
 those that are in gray are those that have 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.890
 dead is worth the maximum capacity of 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:34.960
 we will have sands in those three numbers 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.850
 that we have there below, because we will have it 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.909
 it will be worth thank you will be the number of the 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.570
 right so in this series what I'm going 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:50.080
 to do is going to be is to show each one 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:52.630
 of the sands I will try to do it in order 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.700
 because many of the sands are sometimes 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.399
 see then in that case I will not be able to play 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.560
