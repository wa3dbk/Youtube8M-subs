and what pump capacity we said to this

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.130 
and what pump capacity we said to this
bore<00:00:57.030> well<00:00:57.620> this<00:00:58.620> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> main<00:00:59.160> purpose<00:00:59.430> of

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
bore well this is the main purpose of

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.650 
bore well this is the main purpose of
this<00:01:01.140> so<00:01:01.949> how<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.370> very<00:01:02.670> briefly<00:01:02.969> how<00:01:03.600> do

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
this so how do you very briefly how do

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.469 
this so how do you very briefly how do
you<00:01:03.840> actually<00:01:04.019> do<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.589> pump<00:01:04.830> test<00:01:05.090> yeah<00:01:06.119> first

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
you actually do the pump test yeah first

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:16.359 
you actually do the pump test yeah first
of<00:01:07.080> all<00:01:07.320> wait<00:01:07.619> they<00:01:08.520> take<00:01:09.240> the<00:01:09.479> static<00:01:10.229> orderly

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.469 

reading<00:01:17.369> of<00:01:17.670> water<00:01:18.630> level<00:01:19.369> then<00:01:20.369> we<00:01:20.850> start<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
reading of water level then we start a

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.980 
reading of water level then we start a
boom<00:01:22.159> every<00:01:23.159> one<00:01:23.400> minute<00:01:23.580> we<00:01:24.090> take<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.330> reading

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
boom every one minute we take a reading

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.340 
boom every one minute we take a reading
of<00:01:25.320> how<00:01:26.070> speedily<00:01:26.850> water<00:01:27.150> will<00:01:27.659> draw<00:01:28.320> down

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
of how speedily water will draw down

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.240 
of how speedily water will draw down
okay

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
okay

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.800 
okay
then<00:01:29.810> as<00:01:30.810> time<00:01:31.259> long<00:01:31.619> goes<00:01:32.490> then<00:01:33.119> we<00:01:33.240> take<00:01:33.479> this

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
then as time long goes then we take this

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.289 
then as time long goes then we take this
reading<00:01:34.380> after<00:01:34.560> five<00:01:35.009> minutes<00:01:35.159> 10<00:01:36.150> minutes

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
reading after five minutes 10 minutes

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.980 
reading after five minutes 10 minutes
and<00:01:36.570> 15<00:01:36.750> minutes<00:01:37.259> interval<00:01:37.970> then<00:01:38.970> will<00:01:39.780> you

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
and 15 minutes interval then will you

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.410 
and 15 minutes interval then will you
stop<00:01:40.500> boom<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:42.320> would<00:01:43.320> take<00:01:43.500> a<00:01:43.530> recovery<00:01:44.040> of

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
stop boom and would take a recovery of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.749 
stop boom and would take a recovery of
three<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> four<00:01:45.840> hours<00:01:46.110> or<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:47.310> water<00:01:47.520> will

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
three to four hours or the water will

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.660 
three to four hours or the water will
came<00:01:48.570> up<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.990> the<00:01:49.140> static<00:01:49.979> water<00:01:50.159> level<00:01:50.430> which

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
came up to the static water level which

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.039 
came up to the static water level which
are<00:01:51.409> the<00:01:52.409> water<00:01:52.560> level<00:01:52.829> which<00:01:53.009> is<00:01:54.049> present

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
are the water level which is present

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.760 
are the water level which is present
before<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.250> pump<00:01:56.969> start<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:58.320> before<00:01:58.740> doing

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
before the pump start so before doing

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.190 
before the pump start so before doing
the<00:01:59.159> pump<00:01:59.430> test<00:01:59.670> you<00:02:00.270> make<00:02:00.479> sure<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.960> no

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
the pump test you make sure that no

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.260 
the pump test you make sure that no
pumping<00:02:01.619> is<00:02:01.799> done<00:02:02.040> for<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.490> time<00:02:02.700> yeah

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
pumping is done for some time yeah

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.510 
pumping is done for some time yeah
usually<00:02:03.659> how<00:02:04.020> many<00:02:04.200> hours<00:02:04.469> is<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
usually how many hours is that it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.059 
usually how many hours is that it
depends<00:02:06.060> if<00:02:06.689> generally<00:02:07.350> or<00:02:07.439> 24

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
depends if generally or 24

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.020 
depends if generally or 24
ours<00:02:08.189> is<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.420> is<00:02:09.659> a<00:02:09.689> BIST<00:02:10.259> but<00:02:10.979> people<00:02:11.610> cannot

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
ours is that is a BIST but people cannot

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.170 
ours is that is a BIST but people cannot
wait<00:02:12.750> for<00:02:13.439> that<00:02:13.680> time<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.780> according<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> local

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:17.180 
wait for that time so according to local

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.170 
wait for that time so according to local
need<00:02:18.180> of<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.989> bore<00:02:19.230> well<00:02:19.439> we<00:02:20.250> can<00:02:20.459> adjust<00:02:20.700> but

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
need of that bore well we can adjust but

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.890 
need of that bore well we can adjust but
24<00:02:21.900> hours<00:02:22.109> is<00:02:22.409> minimum<00:02:23.189> for<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:25.370> interval<00:02:26.370> for

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
24 hours is minimum for the interval for

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.780 
24 hours is minimum for the interval for
before<00:02:27.900> doing<00:02:28.799> the<00:02:29.010> bearing<00:02:29.280> at<00:02:29.370> a<00:02:29.400> pumping

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
before doing the bearing at a pumping

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.750 
before doing the bearing at a pumping
test<00:02:29.970> so<00:02:30.450> if<00:02:30.599> when<00:02:30.810> you<00:02:30.959> do<00:02:31.200> such<00:02:31.829> pump<00:02:32.220> tests

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
test so if when you do such pump tests

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.330 
test so if when you do such pump tests
for<00:02:33.359> say<00:02:33.569> multiple<00:02:34.109> wells<00:02:34.409> in<00:02:34.769> a<00:02:34.889> particular

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
for say multiple wells in a particular

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.959 
for say multiple wells in a particular
area<00:02:35.629> you<00:02:36.629> can<00:02:36.840> then<00:02:37.079> model<00:02:37.769> out<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.310> find<00:02:38.700> out

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:38.969 
area you can then model out and find out

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:41.599 
area you can then model out and find out
how<00:02:39.329> the<00:02:39.719> overall<00:02:40.109> aquifer<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.950> behaving<00:02:41.400> in

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
how the overall aquifer is behaving in

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.220 
how the overall aquifer is behaving in
that<00:02:41.790> area<00:02:42.090> right<00:02:42.150> yeah<00:02:42.720> what<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.049> capacity

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
that area right yeah what the capacity

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.619 
that area right yeah what the capacity
of<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.799> aquifer<00:02:44.069> is<00:02:44.220> how<00:02:44.939> much<00:02:45.120> groundwater

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
of the aquifer is how much groundwater

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.390 
of the aquifer is how much groundwater
is<00:02:45.810> available<00:02:46.319> you<00:02:46.680> can<00:02:46.859> start<00:02:47.159> guessing

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
is available you can start guessing

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.860 
is available you can start guessing
these<00:02:47.730> things<00:02:48.030> yeah<00:02:48.269> and<00:02:48.480> that's<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
these things yeah and that's the

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.599 
these things yeah and that's the
usefulness<00:02:49.409> of<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.680> pump<00:02:49.889> test<00:02:50.099> some<00:02:50.340> tests

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:50.609 
usefulness of the pump test some tests

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:56.599 
usefulness of the pump test some tests
here<00:02:50.790> also<00:02:51.750> we<00:02:52.230> do<00:02:52.819> elevation<00:02:53.819> take<00:02:54.599> a<00:02:55.609> moral

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
here also we do elevation take a moral

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.210 
here also we do elevation take a moral
inventory<00:02:56.840> from<00:02:57.840> that<00:02:58.049> we<00:02:58.829> know<00:02:59.040> the

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
inventory from that we know the

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.399 
inventory from that we know the
elevation<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.849> that<00:03:00.030> bore<00:03:00.299> will<00:03:00.480> from<00:03:01.200> mean

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
elevation of that bore will from mean

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:03.879 
elevation of that bore will from mean
sea<00:03:01.620> level<00:03:01.650> and<00:03:02.250> also<00:03:02.909> we<00:03:03.450> do<00:03:03.659> a

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:03.889 
sea level and also we do a

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.159 
sea level and also we do a
simultaneously<00:03:04.889> other<00:03:05.430> bore<00:03:05.849> wells<00:03:06.169> pontus

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:07.169 
simultaneously other bore wells pontus

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.819 
simultaneously other bore wells pontus
then<00:03:08.010> we<00:03:08.280> can<00:03:08.519> differentiate<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.930> depth<00:03:10.500> of

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
then we can differentiate the depth of

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.009 
then we can differentiate the depth of
static<00:03:11.340> water<00:03:11.459> level<00:03:11.909> from<00:03:12.540> mean<00:03:12.750> sea<00:03:12.989> level

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
static water level from mean sea level

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.089 
static water level from mean sea level
and<00:03:13.549> we<00:03:14.549> plot<00:03:14.879> all<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:16.099> information

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:17.099 
and we plot all this information

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:20.689 
and we plot all this information
together<00:03:17.310> and<00:03:17.760> we<00:03:18.540> know<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.019> weather<00:03:19.889> this

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:20.699 
together and we know the weather this

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:23.210 
together and we know the weather this
all<00:03:20.970> bore<00:03:21.269> wells<00:03:21.479> are<00:03:21.720> healing<00:03:22.590> water<00:03:22.859> from

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
all bore wells are healing water from

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.250 
all bore wells are healing water from
same<00:03:23.519> aquifer<00:03:24.060> or<00:03:24.510> it<00:03:24.750> is<00:03:24.870> from<00:03:25.109> different

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
same aquifer or it is from different

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.819 
same aquifer or it is from different
aquifer<00:03:25.979> okay<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:27.269> this<00:03:28.019> is<00:03:28.229> the<00:03:28.349> importance

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
aquifer okay so this is the importance

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.330 
aquifer okay so this is the importance
of<00:03:29.010> being<00:03:29.970> more<00:03:30.120> pumping<00:03:30.510> test<00:03:31.190> thanks<00:03:32.190> then

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
of being more pumping test thanks then

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.579 
of being more pumping test thanks then
enjoy
