 hi friends how are we were this 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.959
 occasion is I bring a little trick to 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.290
 simulate all android actions in 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.090
 our ios and it's called andrews this tweet 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:19.250
 we can find it completely 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.200
 free on the network can live to apple if 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.149
 you do not know what is this repo I recommend you 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.520
 see a video that I'm going to leave you in the 

00:00:23.149 --> 00:00:28.130
 description with the best response from 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.720
 birds 8 let's go super fast once 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:32.029
 installed this tweet we're going to 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.180
 configuration and we will find a new 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.440
 tab called andrews comes out easy 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.480
 quick simple we have three options 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.370
 support configuration and credits that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.449
 we are interested in this configuration I am going to 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.920
 try to explain you the most 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.559
 in detail each of the options 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.600
 so that we do not have problems action 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.719
 bar is going to be this bar in black 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.659
 Look, I show you quickly, I want to open 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:56.809
 app store but I regret now I want 

00:00:53.659 --> 00:01:00.319
 me back adjustments will be as 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.210
 could call a quick access to the 

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:04.280
 last application that opened the 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.920
 in the middle is what is going to simulate our 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.570
 home button we press and send us 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.070
 the initial configuration sent us to 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.020
 our home screen and now 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.920
 I want to open multitasking so good with 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.680
 the next 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.770
 easy quick and simple we will not have 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:21.100
 no problem this the following is 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.020
 for our notification center 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:26.180
 we're going to have the same center that 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.770
 android goes out you will not have any 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:30.830
 problem works for us in a way 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:32.630
 incredible and without any problem in 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.670
 I really can not say anything else I have been 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.080
 liked pretty eye was I was 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.509
 forgetting something now that I am 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.149
 mentioning all this that click this on 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.490
 an alpha version what do I mean no 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.770
 comes to beta is still a very click 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.810
 green is a tweet that is not yet 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.729
 100% but that has hitherto 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.429
 worked very well and that's why I bring you 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:55.549
 this video now we find a mini 

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.860
 player widget is this this mini comes out 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:00.679
 player that we have here that works with 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.810
 the apple music with your music that you have 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:04.789
 on your cell phone and it works with spotify 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.970
 For example let's go quickly 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.560
 spotify 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.900
 and we are going to put 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.060
 For this 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:17.930
 let's go here he saved me 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.930
 the pause 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.670
 I'm going forward, I'll pause again 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.140
 and I do not want just as good 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.940
 we close the widget there is no 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.410
 problem now I want to reopen it 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.530
 I enter any application for example 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.720
 here and that's it, I have my widget again 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.790
 I will repeat, I liked this 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.680
 small widget a very fast setting 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.020
 simple and easy to use 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.090
 the power menu if we want to turn off our 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.340
 device we leave pressed and we're going 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.500
 to leave the same menu as in android 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.110
 come out you can play with him without any 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.970
 problem now this search is 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.620
 quite interesting we will find 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.340
 our search engine just like in android 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.000
 directly from google for example 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:04.430
 I want to put or search YouTube for not 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.620
 have problems go 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.019
 and I can do it great I can do it 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.810
 little one we wait here a moment 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.060
 well you already loaded you can see and here the menu 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.829
 I closed it practice friends issue 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.209
 simply but you can do it more 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.049
 You can make it bigger 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:22.670
 let's give it again to go here and 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.560
 let's see if now it comes out we do 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.239
 you should pull the corner 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.819
 there it is already gone 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:31.849
 you can see and to close it here we have 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:34.790
 the safari appointment tache the house and for 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.859
 go back or forward I tell you it 's 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:39.019
 thing of practice is something that you go 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.790
 playing with him to me still does not come out 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.549
 all this well but again I repeat 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.010
 question of practice and without any 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.340
 problem will you be able to now that more 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.530
 fast quick easy accesses are missing 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:54.829
 and simple are these come out completely 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.840
 functional Wi-Fi I already pay for it 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.790
 I turned on and we have to go back to 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.400
 turn on bluetooth 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.120
 I turned it off and I turned it on without any 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.739
 problem 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.930
 location this is the adjustment of 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:08.389
 Automatic brightness comes out as you want 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.490
 If you want to occupy it, do not give me any 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.410
 volume problem 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.010
 you will not find any problem 

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:20.300
 you can see from here you can move it 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:20.300
 but he does not let himself move 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:27.630
 low now if it goes up and down you can 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.220
 put as you want and finally 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:32.670
 Additional features 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:34.440
 here in extras look at the log animation 

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:37.680
 it works without any problem 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.350
 you can see it's very good but in the 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.990
 next to me gave me a little 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:46.129
 problems for you are supposed to paint you the 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:48.800
 browser the browsers bars 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.199
 1 I did not like it and 2 I felt that the 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.080
 device consumed you a lot ram no 

00:04:51.199 --> 00:04:56.449
 I got to feel up slow that's why it was 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.550
 to remove those options but you can 

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:01.159
 go playing can you say creating you can go 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:03.800
 removing the ones you like the most 

00:05:01.159 --> 00:05:06.319
 more suits you or just those that 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.599
 become more beautiful, I activate everything 

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:09.919
 so you could see how it works but you 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:12.050
 for example if you do not want this bar 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:14.959
 Black you take it off if you do not like it 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:16.999
 the notification center you take it off 

00:05:14.959 --> 00:05:18.800
 there is no problem, stay only 

00:05:16.999 --> 00:05:20.839
 with applications or with widgets 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.909
 that you think are necessary and 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:24.559
