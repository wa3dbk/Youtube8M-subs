00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
and let me tell you it took me a very

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.789 
and let me tell you it took me a very
long<00:01:14.369> time<00:01:14.880> I've<00:01:15.270> been<00:01:15.330> going<00:01:15.750> home<00:01:15.960> plate

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
long time I've been going home plate

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:20.149 
long time I've been going home plate
since<00:01:17.280> 2009<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.229> now<00:01:19.409> starting<00:01:19.439> to

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
since 2009 and I'm just now starting to

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.550 
since 2009 and I'm just now starting to
do<00:01:20.280> some<00:01:20.310> switch<00:01:20.820> stuff<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:21.960> but<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.290> think

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
do some switch stuff so yeah but I think

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.410 
do some switch stuff so yeah but I think
the<00:01:22.619> reason<00:01:22.770> it's<00:01:23.009> taking<00:01:23.100> me<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.670> long<00:01:23.939> is

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
the reason it's taking me so long is

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.270 
the reason it's taking me so long is
because<00:01:24.479> when<00:01:25.170> I<00:01:25.200> sesh<00:01:25.619> I'm<00:01:25.979> not<00:01:26.130> really

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
because when I sesh I'm not really

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.130 
because when I sesh I'm not really
trying<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.729> learn<00:01:26.909> stuff<00:01:27.390> as<00:01:27.630> much<00:01:27.659> as<00:01:28.020> I'm

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
single tech tech packs I guess the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.590 
single tech tech packs I guess the
reason<00:01:49.890> I<00:01:50.040> haven't<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.729> because<00:01:50.790> for<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.570> most

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
reason I haven't is because for the most

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.330 
reason I haven't is because for the most
part<00:01:52.110> they're<00:01:52.409> pretty<00:01:52.590> much<00:01:52.649> all<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.310> same

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
part they're pretty much all the same

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.609 
part they're pretty much all the same
except<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.420> graphics<00:01:54.930> so<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.200> think<00:01:55.530> it

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
except for the graphics so I think it

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
except for the graphics so I think it
would<00:01:55.710> get<00:01:55.829> repetitive<00:01:56.130> after<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.790> while<00:01:57.000> but

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
would get repetitive after a while but

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.850 
would get repetitive after a while but
let<00:01:57.750> me<00:01:57.780> know<00:01:57.869> would<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.200> be<00:01:58.350> cool<00:01:58.530> if<00:01:58.590> i
