America that I have so as you can see
there's<00:04:28.050> some<00:04:28.230> differences<00:04:28.680> in<00:04:28.890> the

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
there's some differences in the

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.640 
there's some differences in the
sculpting<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:30.510> the<00:04:30.720> size<00:04:30.960> and<00:04:30.990> things<00:04:31.530> like

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
sculpting and the size and things like

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.400 
sculpting and the size and things like
that<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.160> overall<00:04:33.120> I<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.480> really<00:04:33.930> do<00:04:34.080> like<00:04:34.230> the

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
that but overall I I really do like the

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.620 
that but overall I I really do like the
way<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.560> movie<00:04:34.890> series<00:04:35.190> looks<00:04:35.630> his

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
way the movie series looks his

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.600 
way the movie series looks his
articulation<00:04:37.380> is<00:04:37.530> very<00:04:37.920> good<00:04:39.920> he<00:04:40.920> rotates<00:04:41.370> at

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
articulation is very good he rotates at

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:45.110 
articulation is very good he rotates at
the<00:04:41.760> head<00:04:41.940> all<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.540> way<00:04:42.570> around<00:04:43.850> you<00:04:44.850> can<00:04:45.000> go

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
the head all the way around you can go

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.060 
the head all the way around you can go
down<00:04:45.360> a<00:04:45.390> little<00:04:45.600> bit<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:46.230> not<00:04:46.380> really<00:04:46.440> all

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
down a little bit but not really all

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.210 
down a little bit but not really all
that<00:04:47.250> much<00:04:47.430> up<00:04:47.670> mostly<00:04:48.510> straight<00:04:49.220> rotates

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
that much up mostly straight rotates

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.940 
that much up mostly straight rotates
completely<00:04:50.730> around<00:04:51.060> at<00:04:51.330> the<00:04:51.450> shoulder<00:04:51.950> goes

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:52.950 
completely around at the shoulder goes

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
completely around at the shoulder goes
in<00:04:53.190> and<00:04:53.310> out<00:04:53.430> at<00:04:53.610> the<00:04:53.640> shoulder<00:04:55.640> rotates<00:04:56.640> all

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:56.970 
in and out at the shoulder rotates all

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:59.660 
in and out at the shoulder rotates all
the<00:04:57.000> way<00:04:57.210> around<00:04:57.540> at<00:04:57.780> the<00:04:57.960> elbow<00:04:58.370> goes<00:04:59.370> in

00:04:59.660 --> 00:04:59.670 
the way around at the elbow goes in

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:02.090 
the way around at the elbow goes in
about<00:05:00.180> 90<00:05:00.450> degrees<00:05:00.570> goes<00:05:01.440> down<00:05:01.740> a<00:05:01.770> little<00:05:01.950> bit

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
about 90 degrees goes down a little bit

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.690 
about 90 degrees goes down a little bit
as<00:05:02.250> well

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:02.700 
as well

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.350

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.160 
around he also has the ab crunch right
here<00:05:10.710> where<00:05:11.220> he<00:05:11.550> can<00:05:11.970> also<00:05:12.300> rotate<00:05:12.720> all<00:05:13.140> the

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
here where he can also rotate all the

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:17.300 
here where he can also rotate all the
way<00:05:13.320> around<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:14.580> go<00:05:15.710> in<00:05:16.710> and<00:05:16.890> out<00:05:16.980> a<00:05:17.040> little

way around and go in and out a little
bit<00:05:17.430> as<00:05:17.580> well<00:05:18.740> his<00:05:19.820> articulation<00:05:20.820> right<00:05:21.510> here

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
bit as well his articulation right here

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:26.030 
bit as well his articulation right here
at<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.650> hips<00:05:23.419> are<00:05:24.419> the<00:05:25.050> kind<00:05:25.410> of<00:05:25.530> joints<00:05:25.890> that

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
at the hips are the kind of joints that

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.340 
at the hips are the kind of joints that
I<00:05:26.070> really<00:05:26.370> don't<00:05:26.460> care<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.760> because<00:05:27.350> they're

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.350 
I really don't care for because they're

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:30.680 
I really don't care for because they're
hard<00:05:28.650> to<00:05:28.800> manipulate<00:05:29.040> but<00:05:29.970> once<00:05:30.240> you<00:05:30.360> get<00:05:30.540> them

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690 
hard to manipulate but once you get them

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.200 
hard to manipulate but once you get them
going<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:31.830> way<00:05:31.980> you<00:05:32.040> want<00:05:32.130> them<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.610> his<00:05:32.940> legs

going the way you want them to his legs

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:36.200 
going the way you want them to his legs
do<00:05:33.510> go<00:05:33.750> forward<00:05:34.169> and<00:05:34.320> back<00:05:34.500> in<00:05:34.740> and<00:05:34.919> out<00:05:35.210> rather

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
do go forward and back in and out rather

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:37.670 
do go forward and back in and out rather
well<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:36.780> you<00:05:36.840> can<00:05:36.990> get<00:05:37.110> him<00:05:37.200> to<00:05:37.260> some<00:05:37.500> nice

poses with them and he has rotation all
the<00:05:43.229> way<00:05:43.350> around<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> leg<00:05:43.919> and<00:05:44.540> double<00:05:45.540> joints

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:45.900 
the way around the leg and double joints

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:50.659 
the way around the leg and double joints
at<00:05:46.080> the<00:05:46.200> knee<00:05:48.919> giving<00:05:49.919> him<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.070> wide<00:05:50.310> range<00:05:50.580> of

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:50.669 
at the knee giving him a wide range of

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:53.000 
at the knee giving him a wide range of
movement<00:05:51.120> and<00:05:51.510> he<00:05:51.750> does<00:05:51.990> rotate<00:05:52.530> all<00:05:52.800> the<00:05:52.830> way

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:53.010 
movement and he does rotate all the way

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:57.890 
movement and he does rotate all the way
around<00:05:53.130> at<00:05:53.910> the<00:05:54.600> ankle<00:05:55.940> so<00:05:56.940> altogether<00:05:57.479> this

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
around at the ankle so altogether this

himself<00:06:18.680> he<00:06:19.680> does<00:06:19.830> not<00:06:19.979> necessarily<00:06:20.550> look

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:20.729 
himself he does not necessarily look

00:06:20.729 --> 00:06:22.340 
himself he does not necessarily look
like<00:06:20.760> the<00:06:21.060> actor<00:06:21.390> who<00:06:21.540> portrays<00:06:21.900> him<00:06:22.140> in<00:06:22.260> the

movie but I considering that this is
such<00:06:24.510> a<00:06:24.540> small<00:06:24.810> figure<00:06:25.080> I'm<00:06:25.470> really<00:06:25.740> not<00:06:25.860> too

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:26.160 
such a small figure I'm really not too

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:28.760 
such a small figure I'm really not too
concerned<00:06:26.610> with<00:06:26.820> that<00:06:27.229> the<00:06:28.229> only<00:06:28.290> problem<00:06:28.590> I

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
concerned with that the only problem I

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:31.010 
concerned with that the only problem I
have<00:06:28.950> with<00:06:29.580> my<00:06:29.820> particular<00:06:30.150> figure<00:06:30.630> is<00:06:30.810> that<00:06:30.840> I

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:31.020 
have with my particular figure is that I

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.600 
have with my particular figure is that I
have<00:06:31.260> a<00:06:31.290> difficult<00:06:31.770> time<00:06:31.919> getting<00:06:31.979> him<00:06:32.520> to
