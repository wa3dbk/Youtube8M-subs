00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
actually mostly for looks it doesn't

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:53.960

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
actually do anything else I don't think

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.219 
actually do anything else I don't think
it<00:01:54.119> may<00:01:54.299> produce<00:01:54.509> some<00:01:54.689> small<00:01:55.020> protection

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229

chest plate is for protection
specifically<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.290> what<00:01:58.439> it<00:01:58.530> does<00:01:58.680> for<00:01:58.950> you

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
really really nice to have that you know

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:25.940 
really really nice to have that you know
sprinting<00:02:24.900> is<00:02:25.230> another<00:02:25.560> thing<00:02:25.709> you<00:02:25.830> could

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
sprinting is another thing you could

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.440 
sprinting is another thing you could
obviously<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.549> separately<00:02:27.030> but<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.269> kind

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
obviously have separately but this kind

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.430 
obviously have separately but this kind
of<00:02:27.480> just<00:02:27.629> tries<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.840> make<00:02:27.930> it<00:02:28.140> more<00:02:28.230> like<00:02:28.409> a

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
of just tries to make it more like a

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.020 
of just tries to make it more like a
samurai<00:02:28.890> it's<00:02:28.950> not<00:02:29.159> really<00:02:29.370> sprinting<00:02:29.910> cuz

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
samurai it's not really sprinting cuz

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.369 
samurai it's not really sprinting cuz
you're<00:02:30.120> not<00:02:30.150> you<00:02:30.599> know<00:02:30.690> going<00:02:30.840> back<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.170> forth

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:31.379 
you're not you know going back and forth

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:32.809 
you're not you know going back and forth
of<00:02:31.470> running<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:32.010> just<00:02:32.069> simply<00:02:32.459> makes<00:02:32.670> you

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
of running it just simply makes you

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.670 
of running it just simply makes you
faster<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.299> movement<00:02:33.840> every<00:02:34.049> direction<00:02:34.560> you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
faster and movement every direction you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.369 
faster and movement every direction you
go<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.400> move<00:02:35.580> much<00:02:35.760> faster<00:02:36.269> so<00:02:36.840> if<00:02:37.140> you<00:02:37.230> go

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
go you move much faster so if you go

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:38.720 
go you move much faster so if you go
over<00:02:37.410> here<00:02:37.560> though<00:02:37.769> you<00:02:37.830> get<00:02:37.980> boots<00:02:38.310> boots

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
over here though you get boots boots

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.610 
over here though you get boots boots
also<00:02:39.150> add<00:02:39.329> an<00:02:39.540> ability<00:02:39.989> for<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.319> to<00:02:40.379> jump

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
also add an ability for you to jump

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.699 
also add an ability for you to jump
higher<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> ninja<00:02:42.269> or<00:02:42.599> Samurai<00:02:43.260> if<00:02:43.530> you

of choppy issue in your jumping but
that's<00:02:58.019> okay<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.290> think<00:02:58.859> it<00:02:58.980> may<00:02:59.220> be<00:02:59.250> intended

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
that's okay I think it may be intended

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.670 
that's okay I think it may be intended
to<00:02:59.819> be<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.060> way<00:03:00.150> it's<00:03:00.359> just<00:03:00.450> so<00:03:00.660> fast<00:03:00.989> and<00:03:01.260> if

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
to be that way it's just so fast and if

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.080 
to be that way it's just so fast and if
not<00:03:01.859> I'm<00:03:02.010> sure<00:03:02.160> it'll<00:03:02.280> be<00:03:02.340> fixed<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.819> the<00:03:02.849> next

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
not I'm sure it'll be fixed in the next

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.789 
not I'm sure it'll be fixed in the next
version<00:03:03.269> or<00:03:03.569> something<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:03.959> that<00:03:04.200> so<00:03:04.440> you

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
version or something like that so you

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:06.020 
version or something like that so you
can<00:03:04.920> still<00:03:05.069> do<00:03:05.160> normal<00:03:05.430> jumps<00:03:05.670> if<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:05.819> just<00:03:05.940> do

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
can still do normal jumps if you just do

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.369 
can still do normal jumps if you just do
auto<00:03:06.180> jump<00:03:06.480> you<00:03:06.599> can<00:03:06.629> kind<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> just<00:03:07.079> jump<00:03:07.290> over

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:07.379 
auto jump you can kind of just jump over

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:09.500 
auto jump you can kind of just jump over
the<00:03:07.620> sand<00:03:07.910> sometimes<00:03:08.910> it<00:03:09.090> will<00:03:09.150> just<00:03:09.209> let<00:03:09.480> you

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
the sand sometimes it will just let you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.420 
the sand sometimes it will just let you
do<00:03:09.690> that<00:03:09.810> but<00:03:10.019> the<00:03:10.530> other<00:03:10.560> jumps<00:03:11.010> though<00:03:11.190> it

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
do that but the other jumps though it

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.430 
do that but the other jumps though it
seems<00:03:11.730> that<00:03:11.940> it<00:03:12.030> likes<00:03:12.359> to<00:03:12.660> jump<00:03:12.989> see<00:03:13.319> like

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
seems that it likes to jump see like

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.080 
seems that it likes to jump see like
that<00:03:13.560> was<00:03:13.769> a<00:03:13.799> normal<00:03:14.160> jump<00:03:14.370> but<00:03:14.970> if<00:03:15.060> you

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
that was a normal jump but if you

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
that was a normal jump but if you
actually<00:03:15.359> use<00:03:15.540> the<00:03:15.629> jump<00:03:15.900> button<00:03:16.500> that's<00:03:16.980> how

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
actually use the jump button that's how

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.309 
actually use the jump button that's how
you<00:03:17.220> use<00:03:17.459> these<00:03:17.819> samurai<00:03:18.090> jumping<00:03:18.660> ability<00:03:19.079> so

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:26.479 
what he's supposed to look like though

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:28.090 
what he's supposed to look like though
and<00:04:26.720> I<00:04:27.020> just<00:04:27.199> haven't<00:04:27.380> managed<00:04:27.770> to<00:04:27.949> actually

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
and I just haven't managed to actually

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.730 
and I just haven't managed to actually
see<00:04:28.610> him<00:04:28.850> and<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.510> like<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:29.930> said<00:04:29.960> I<00:04:30.110> haven't<00:04:30.380> have

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:30.740 
see him and I like I said I haven't have

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:32.710 
see him and I like I said I haven't have
a<00:04:30.770> few<00:04:31.010> spawn<00:04:31.250> eggs<00:04:31.460> over<00:04:31.669> there<00:04:31.790> so<00:04:32.060> let<00:04:32.540> me

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:32.720 
a few spawn eggs over there so let me

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.370 
a few spawn eggs over there so let me
grab<00:04:32.990> them<00:04:33.699> but<00:04:34.699> for<00:04:34.880> some<00:04:35.120> reason<00:04:35.810> it<00:04:36.350> just

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
grab them but for some reason it just

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:38.080 
grab them but for some reason it just
doesn't<00:04:36.949> you<00:04:37.160> know<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.610> just<00:04:37.729> saw<00:04:37.820> me<00:04:37.940> put

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
doesn't you know you just saw me put

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:39.370 
doesn't you know you just saw me put
some<00:04:38.240> bull's<00:04:38.389> eye<00:04:38.479> it<00:04:38.750> doesn't<00:04:38.780> do<00:04:39.139> anything

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
some bull's eye it doesn't do anything

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.620 
some bull's eye it doesn't do anything
so<00:04:39.860> again<00:04:40.790> I<00:04:40.820> don't<00:04:40.940> know<00:04:41.060> if<00:04:41.210> s<00:04:41.300> is<00:04:41.419> a<00:04:41.449> feature

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:41.630 
so again I don't know if s is a feature

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:42.939 
so again I don't know if s is a feature
that's<00:04:41.780> being<00:04:41.960> worked<00:04:42.110> on<00:04:42.320> right<00:04:42.380> now<00:04:42.680> or<00:04:42.889> if

00:04:42.939 --> 00:04:42.949 
that's being worked on right now or if

00:04:42.949 --> 00:04:44.830 
that's being worked on right now or if
it's<00:04:43.070> actually<00:04:43.430> ready<00:04:43.699> but<00:04:44.000> anyway<00:04:44.630> it's<00:04:44.780> a

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:44.840 
it's actually ready but anyway it's a

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.090 
it's actually ready but anyway it's a
super<00:04:45.050> cool<00:04:45.229> mod<00:04:45.440> overall<00:04:45.740> though<00:04:45.889> you<00:04:45.949> know

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:46.100 
super cool mod overall though you know

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:47.500 
super cool mod overall though you know
it<00:04:46.190> adds<00:04:46.310> a<00:04:46.400> bunch<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.729> cool<00:04:46.910> things<00:04:47.180> some<00:04:47.360> fun

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:47.510 
it adds a bunch of cool things some fun

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:48.820 
it adds a bunch of cool things some fun
stuff<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.840> play<00:04:47.990> around<00:04:48.199> with<00:04:48.380> to<00:04:48.560> kill<00:04:48.710> some

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
stuff to play around with to kill some

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.040 
stuff to play around with to kill some
animals<00:04:49.190> with<00:04:49.310> katanas<00:04:49.850> like<00:04:50.330> a<00:04:50.360> samurai<00:04:50.750> and

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
animals with katanas like a samurai and

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.629 
animals with katanas like a samurai and
so<00:04:51.500> I<00:04:51.530> think<00:04:51.680> it's<00:04:51.919> definitely<00:04:52.070> worth<00:04:52.310> you

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
so I think it's definitely worth you

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:54.820 
so I think it's definitely worth you
getting<00:04:52.669> so<00:04:53.180> it's<00:04:53.330> a<00:04:53.360> pretty<00:04:53.540> cool<00:04:53.600> mod<00:04:53.900> this

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
getting so it's a pretty cool mod this

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.020 
getting so it's a pretty cool mod this
