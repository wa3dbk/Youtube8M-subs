 and we are in grace style in this 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:15.040
 program are you going to learn something very 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:17.500
 important style is not something with 

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.630
 what is born is something that is learned with 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.630
 the time and on the road 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:29.610
 today I would like to talk with you 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.570
 about a very popular drink that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.870
 flame whiskey whiskey one hundred percent 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.340
 Scottish drink invention and development of 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.040
 the Scots in fact the word whiskey 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:48.000
 comes from the Scottish Welshman who 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.540
 he pronounced busy beata what does it mean 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.300
 basically brandy and that's what 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.020
 it is a whiskey a malting liquor 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:01.020
 Sebha fermented barley 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.870
 breeds and ages in oak barrels 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:09.090
 white that previously served to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.520
 create port sherry or bourbon these are 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.070
 indispensable requirements for you 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.860
 talk about a real whiskey if a 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.500
 Whiskey does not come from Scotland and does not 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.810
 comes from malted barley and is not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.340
 aged in oak barrels with those 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:25.740
 features I just mentioned 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.800
 you are not talking about a whiskey 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.540
 true and is that this brandy if 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.730
 he has his joke 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.610
 if you try it alone nothing else 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.400
 chilled with a little bit of it came to you to 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.700
 know what it is when a drink enters the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.730
 body and body knows and feels what 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.660
 receive believe me it is not 

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:50.010
 whiskey is not a myth if it works like 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.630
 a 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.060
 alarm of stimuli in the organism 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.850
 human and particularly in the body 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.110
 male I asked him why but I think 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.110
 that women do not know as well as 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.500
 to us men 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.500
 pay attention that in the labels 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.810
 of the bottle indicate very clearly what 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.750
 it means what you are drinking if 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.330
 says the blended means that this 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.520
 Whiskey comes from whiskeys taken from 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.960
 different barrels of different 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:24.570
 distilleries if it says simple marta are 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.910
 different barrels but the same 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.959
 distillery and there is a classification 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:33.840
 more than it's called simple cas that the 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:38.670
 single cash that is whiskey that comes 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.610
 from a single barrel and on the label it 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.920
 they mention how many years of aging 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:46.830
 have the whiskey that you are going to take 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.959
 those of 12 and 18 years and 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.030
 there are more but as they increase 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.830
 the years of aging increases 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.360
 exponentially the price of whiskey 

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:59.520
 However, a 12 year old does not really have 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:01.830
 but he does not have how to reject it is very 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.970
 good whiskey obviously the 18 is a lot 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:07.640
 better and then the category goes up 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.130
 notice that whiskey grows old 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.920
 only in the barrels does not age 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.690
 in the bottle that the bottle has ten 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.340
 years in the cellar does not mean that 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:18.260
 better the whiskey what matters 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.780
 truly were the years that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.020
 they went through in barrel those are the 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.760
 that give the flavor the solera and the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:27.350
 category to the whiskey that you are going to 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560
 ingest 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.590
 take on the rocks or have it accompany 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.810
 with a little water a little bit of soda water 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.450
 try it as a snack as a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:40.070
 refreshing or even after the 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.170
 food you will see that it is not going to 

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.170
 repent because it is a drink that will

 will stimulate your whole body friends 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.300
