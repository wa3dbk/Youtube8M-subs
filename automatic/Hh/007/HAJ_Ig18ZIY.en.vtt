00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
nougat layer and spread it over the top

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.580 
nougat layer and spread it over the top
of<00:02:37.740> this<00:02:38.490> chocolate<00:02:39.060> layer<00:02:39.630> that's<00:02:39.930> been<00:02:40.170> set

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
of this chocolate layer that's been set

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.380 
of this chocolate layer that's been set
so<00:02:41.280> it's<00:02:41.460> been<00:02:41.700> sitting<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.000> their<00:02:42.150> fridge

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
so it's been sitting in their fridge

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:45.920 
so it's been sitting in their fridge
until<00:02:42.600> it<00:02:42.990> is<00:02:43.230> solid<00:02:44.300> spread<00:02:45.300> it<00:02:45.420> around<00:02:45.540> is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
until it is solid spread it around is

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.020 
until it is solid spread it around is
evenly<00:02:46.350> as<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.800> can<00:02:47.070> and<00:02:47.310> flatten<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.850> top

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
evenly as you can and flatten the top

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.450 
evenly as you can and flatten the top
out<00:02:48.300> and<00:02:48.540> then<00:02:49.410> you<00:02:49.650> guessed<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.280> is

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
out and then you guessed it this is

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:51.980 
out and then you guessed it this is
going<00:02:50.640> into<00:02:50.880> the<00:02:51.030> refrigerator<00:02:51.540> as<00:02:51.750> well

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:51.990 
going into the refrigerator as well

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:54.530 
going into the refrigerator as well
because<00:02:52.320> this<00:02:52.500> needs<00:02:52.830> to<00:02:53.070> set<00:02:53.310> while<00:02:54.300> that

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
because this needs to set while that

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.150 
because this needs to set while that
you're<00:02:54.960> waiting<00:02:55.290> for<00:02:55.320> that<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.650> set<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:56.010> can

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
you're waiting for that to set you can

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.280 
you're waiting for that to set you can
make<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.670> next<00:02:57.060> layer<00:02:57.600> which<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:57.930> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.230> be

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
make the next layer which is going to be

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.460 
make the next layer which is going to be
the<00:02:58.410> caramel<00:02:58.860> layer<00:02:59.090> now<00:03:00.090> you<00:03:00.150> need<00:03:00.540> 14<00:03:01.050> ounces

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
the caramel layer now you need 14 ounces

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.640 
the caramel layer now you need 14 ounces
which<00:03:01.709> is<00:03:01.830> approximately<00:03:02.130> 400<00:03:03.000> grams<00:03:03.270> of

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
which is approximately 400 grams of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.830 
which is approximately 400 grams of
caramels<00:03:04.650> and<00:03:05.060> these<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.300> individually

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
caramels and these are the individually

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.390 
caramels and these are the individually
wrapped<00:03:06.870> kind<00:03:07.350> so<00:03:07.530> the<00:03:07.680> hardest<00:03:08.010> part<00:03:08.250> of<00:03:08.310> this

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
wrapped kind so the hardest part of this

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.940 
wrapped kind so the hardest part of this
is<00:03:08.459> unwrapping<00:03:08.940> them<00:03:09.240> now<00:03:10.230> I<00:03:10.260> found<00:03:10.680> when<00:03:10.920> I

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:18.979 
really really soft they're softer than
the<00:03:17.430> normal<00:03:17.760> brand<00:03:18.000> I<00:03:18.120> usually<00:03:18.480> get<00:03:18.630> I<00:03:18.690> usually

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
the normal brand I usually get I usually

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.180 
the normal brand I usually get I usually
get<00:03:19.050> the<00:03:19.110> kraft<00:03:19.410> caramels<00:03:19.830> and<00:03:19.890> these<00:03:20.040> were

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
get the kraft caramels and these were

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.479 
get the kraft caramels and these were
like<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.750> different<00:03:21.750> brand<00:03:22.170> and<00:03:22.620> I<00:03:23.190> was<00:03:23.340> really

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
like a different brand and I was really

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.820 
like a different brand and I was really
concerned<00:03:23.790> about<00:03:24.330> these<00:03:24.810> caramels<00:03:25.320> being<00:03:25.560> too

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
concerned about these caramels being too

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:28.160 
concerned about these caramels being too
soft<00:03:26.040> because<00:03:26.520> the<00:03:26.940> original<00:03:27.300> recipe<00:03:27.750> wants

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
soft because the original recipe wants

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.970 
soft because the original recipe wants
you<00:03:28.380> to<00:03:29.000> melt<00:03:30.000> up<00:03:30.720> one<00:03:31.020> package<00:03:31.440> of<00:03:31.560> caramels

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
you to melt up one package of caramels

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:35.210 
you to melt up one package of caramels
with<00:03:32.310> a<00:03:32.340> quarter<00:03:32.760> cup<00:03:32.940> of<00:03:33.090> whipping<00:03:33.330> cream<00:03:34.220> now

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
with a quarter cup of whipping cream now

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.039 
with a quarter cup of whipping cream now
I<00:03:35.250> thought<00:03:35.760> if<00:03:35.910> I<00:03:36.030> added<00:03:36.330> that<00:03:36.420> quarter<00:03:36.780> cup<00:03:36.959> of

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
I thought if I added that quarter cup of

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:38.990 
I thought if I added that quarter cup of
whipping<00:03:37.230> cream<00:03:37.350> that<00:03:37.830> these<00:03:37.980> caramels<00:03:38.580> would

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
whipping cream that these caramels would

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.080 
whipping cream that these caramels would
be<00:03:39.150> way<00:03:39.420> too<00:03:39.450> soft<00:03:40.350> and<00:03:40.560> gooey<00:03:40.830> in<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.220> bars

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
be way too soft and gooey in the bars

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.880 
be way too soft and gooey in the bars
and<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> bars<00:03:42.540> wouldn't<00:03:43.260> be<00:03:43.320> able<00:03:43.440> to<00:03:43.560> be<00:03:43.680> cut

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
and the bars wouldn't be able to be cut

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.090 
and the bars wouldn't be able to be cut
properly<00:03:44.370> so<00:03:45.030> what<00:03:45.180> I<00:03:45.209> did<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.170> change<00:03:46.920> the

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.100 
properly so what I did is I change the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
top layer we're going to repeat the same

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.210 
top layer we're going to repeat the same
thing<00:04:00.690> we<00:04:00.780> did<00:04:00.900> before<00:04:00.959> for<00:04:01.650> the<00:04:01.739> bottom<00:04:02.040> layer

thing we did before for the bottom layer

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.100 
thing we did before for the bottom layer
which<00:04:02.489> is<00:04:02.580> basically<00:04:02.940> a<00:04:03.060> cup<00:04:03.330> of<00:04:03.480> chocolate

spread it over the top of the caramel
layer<00:04:18.000> then<00:04:18.690> I<00:04:18.720> put<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.109> back<00:04:19.350> in<00:04:19.620> the

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
layer then I put this back in the

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.349 
layer then I put this back in the
refrigerator<00:04:19.859> and<00:04:20.459> allowed<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:20.910> to<00:04:21.060> set

refrigerator and allowed it to set

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.260 
refrigerator and allowed it to set
completely<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.669> pulled<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.790> out<00:04:23.850> of<00:04:23.910> the<00:04:24.030> pan

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
completely I pulled it out of the pan

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.330 
completely I pulled it out of the pan
using<00:04:24.660> that<00:04:24.780> aluminum<00:04:25.110> foil<00:04:25.380> peel<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:26.070> foil

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
using that aluminum foil peel the foil

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.290 
using that aluminum foil peel the foil
down<00:04:26.610> and<00:04:26.940> then<00:04:27.240> attempted<00:04:27.720> to<00:04:27.810> cut<00:04:27.990> these<00:04:28.200> I

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:29.300 
down and then attempted to cut these I

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.940 
down and then attempted to cut these I
realized<00:04:30.300> immediately<00:04:30.570> when<00:04:31.530> I<00:04:31.560> started<00:04:31.860> to

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
realized immediately when I started to

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.240 
realized immediately when I started to
cut<00:04:32.190> that<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.180> caramel<00:04:33.780> layer<00:04:33.930> was<00:04:34.350> hard<00:04:35.010> as

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
cut that that caramel layer was hard as

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.370 
cut that that caramel layer was hard as
a<00:04:35.280> rock<00:04:35.400> it<00:04:35.820> was<00:04:35.940> really<00:04:36.419> really<00:04:36.900> hard<00:04:37.169> to<00:04:37.290> get

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
a rock it was really really hard to get

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.680 
a rock it was really really hard to get
through<00:04:37.590> that<00:04:37.770> caramel<00:04:38.250> layer<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:38.850> I

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
through that caramel layer and I

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.480 
through that caramel layer and I
realized<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:40.169> probably<00:04:40.229> made<00:04:40.770> a<00:04:40.800> mistake<00:04:41.250> and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
realized I probably made a mistake and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.940 
realized I probably made a mistake and
that<00:04:42.240> I<00:04:42.270> should<00:04:42.720> have<00:04:42.840> added<00:04:43.200> the<00:04:43.349> cream<00:04:43.680> to

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:43.950 
that I should have added the cream to

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:44.890 
that I should have added the cream to
the<00:04:44.070> caramels

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
the caramels

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.710 
the caramels
even<00:04:45.830> though<00:04:45.980> they<00:04:46.190> were<00:04:46.250> kind<00:04:46.550> of<00:04:46.640> soft<00:04:46.940> so

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720 
even though they were kind of soft so

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.240 
even though they were kind of soft so
just<00:04:48.050> to<00:04:48.170> show<00:04:48.350> you<00:04:48.380> what<00:04:48.590> they<00:04:48.680> look<00:04:48.710> like<00:04:49.040> in

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.250 
just to show you what they look like in

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.270 
just to show you what they look like in
profile<00:04:49.910> here<00:04:50.240> I<00:04:50.390> mean<00:04:50.600> they<00:04:51.110> looked<00:04:51.500> okay<00:04:52.010> as

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:52.280 
profile here I mean they looked okay as

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:54.670 
profile here I mean they looked okay as
you<00:04:52.730> can<00:04:52.760> see<00:04:52.940> they<00:04:53.510> do<00:04:53.570> look<00:04:53.840> a<00:04:53.900> little<00:04:54.170> like<00:04:54.320> a

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:54.680 
you can see they do look a little like a

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.800 
you can see they do look a little like a
Snickers<00:04:55.190> bar<00:04:55.220> and<00:04:55.760> it<00:04:55.910> did<00:04:56.030> come<00:04:56.210> apart<00:04:56.540> for

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
Snickers bar and it did come apart for

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:59.230 
Snickers bar and it did come apart for
that<00:04:56.900> first<00:04:57.230> piece<00:04:57.470> but<00:04:58.190> when<00:04:58.340> I<00:04:58.370> tried<00:04:58.820> to<00:04:58.850> cut

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
that first piece but when I tried to cut

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.780 
that first piece but when I tried to cut
these<00:04:59.420> into<00:04:59.750> more<00:05:00.200> pieces<00:05:00.500> I<00:05:00.890> was<00:05:01.430> running

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:01.790 
these into more pieces I was running

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.610 
these into more pieces I was running
into<00:05:01.910> some<00:05:02.210> big<00:05:02.480> problems<00:05:02.990> I<00:05:03.170> was<00:05:03.320> running

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:03.620 
into some big problems I was running

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:04.960 
into some big problems I was running
into<00:05:03.770> the<00:05:03.860> fact<00:05:04.100> that<00:05:04.340> when<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.520> was<00:05:04.670> trying<00:05:04.940> to

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
into the fact that when I was trying to

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.090 
into the fact that when I was trying to
slice<00:05:05.330> trying<00:05:06.200> to<00:05:06.260> get<00:05:06.350> through<00:05:06.500> that<00:05:06.590> caramel

slice trying to get through that caramel

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:08.740 
slice trying to get through that caramel
layer<00:05:07.220> cause<00:05:07.610> the<00:05:07.910> rest<00:05:08.090> of<00:05:08.240> the<00:05:08.300> layers<00:05:08.450> to

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
layer cause the rest of the layers to

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.430 
layer cause the rest of the layers to
get<00:05:08.870> squished

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
get squished

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.860 
get squished
and<00:05:09.580> that<00:05:10.580> top<00:05:10.910> chocolate<00:05:11.390> layer<00:05:11.540> was

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:11.870 
and that top chocolate layer was

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.930 
and that top chocolate layer was
detaching<00:05:12.560> from<00:05:13.130> that<00:05:13.370> caramel<00:05:13.850> layer

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
detaching from that caramel layer

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.870 
detaching from that caramel layer
completely<00:05:14.690> as<00:05:14.780> you<00:05:14.930> can<00:05:15.080> see<00:05:15.260> here<00:05:15.880> detaching

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
completely as you can see here detaching

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:19.360 
completely as you can see here detaching
completely<00:05:17.420> I<00:05:17.600> was<00:05:18.140> getting<00:05:18.440> squished<00:05:18.890> nougat

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
completely I was getting squished nougat

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.460 
completely I was getting squished nougat
and<00:05:19.550> the<00:05:20.180> bottom<00:05:20.570> chocolate<00:05:20.840> layer<00:05:21.200> was

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:21.470 
and the bottom chocolate layer was

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.520 
and the bottom chocolate layer was
sticking<00:05:21.890> like<00:05:22.190> crazy<00:05:22.640> to<00:05:23.540> that<00:05:23.960> aluminum

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
foil as you can see here I was very

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.110 
foil as you can see here I was very
discouraged<00:05:28.220> at<00:05:28.340> this<00:05:28.490> point<00:05:28.790> that<00:05:28.910> I<00:05:28.970> had

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:29.120

very much like Snickers bars the first
day<00:06:08.810> I<00:06:08.840> found<00:06:09.080> the<00:06:09.260> caramel<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.860> little<00:06:10.220> bit<00:06:10.340> on

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
day I found the caramel a little bit on

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.160 
day I found the caramel a little bit on
the<00:06:10.700> chewy<00:06:10.940> side<00:06:11.210> a<00:06:11.270> little<00:06:11.630> bit<00:06:11.750> on<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:11.930> hard

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:12.170 
the chewy side a little bit on the hard

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:16.690 
the chewy side a little bit on the hard
side<00:06:12.410> but<00:06:13.190> the<00:06:13.910> next<00:06:14.390> day<00:06:14.920> when<00:06:15.920> I<00:06:16.160> tried<00:06:16.670> to

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:16.700 
side but the next day when I tried to

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.450 
side but the next day when I tried to
cut<00:06:16.970> these<00:06:17.120> further<00:06:17.510> and<00:06:17.960> I<00:06:18.440> gave<00:06:18.680> them<00:06:18.860> a<00:06:19.010> try

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:19.460 
cut these further and I gave them a try

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:21.910 
cut these further and I gave them a try
I<00:06:19.850> realized<00:06:20.720> that<00:06:20.930> the<00:06:21.050> actual<00:06:21.350> caramel

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:21.920 
I realized that the actual caramel

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:24.610 
I realized that the actual caramel
itself<00:06:22.340> had<00:06:22.910> bonded<00:06:23.720> with<00:06:23.900> the<00:06:24.080> chocolate<00:06:24.500> on

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:24.620 
itself had bonded with the chocolate on

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:26.620 
itself had bonded with the chocolate on
the<00:06:24.740> top<00:06:24.770> so<00:06:25.190> it<00:06:25.340> was<00:06:25.460> no<00:06:25.610> longer<00:06:25.790> peeling<00:06:26.390> and

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:26.630 
the top so it was no longer peeling and

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:28.630 
the top so it was no longer peeling and
the<00:06:27.290> caramel<00:06:27.710> had<00:06:27.890> absorbed<00:06:28.190> some<00:06:28.460> of<00:06:28.580> the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
the caramel had absorbed some of the

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.880 
the caramel had absorbed some of the
moisture<00:06:29.000> from<00:06:29.300> the<00:06:29.540> the<00:06:29.900> rest<00:06:30.350> of<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.680> layers

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:30.890 
moisture from the the rest of the layers

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.970 
moisture from the the rest of the layers
and<00:06:31.190> it<00:06:31.760> had<00:06:31.910> softened<00:06:32.480> significantly<00:06:33.410> so

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:33.980 
and it had softened significantly so

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:36.160 
and it had softened significantly so
actually<00:06:34.550> the<00:06:34.730> next<00:06:35.030> day<00:06:35.180> these<00:06:35.720> turned<00:06:36.050> out

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
actually the next day these turned out

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:39.040 
actually the next day these turned out
to<00:06:36.410> be<00:06:36.530> just<00:06:37.160> perfect<00:06:37.520> so<00:06:38.360> I<00:06:38.660> would<00:06:38.870> recommend
