00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:28.530 
is quite unusual for most installations
almost<00:02:23.110> there<00:02:26.670> it's<00:02:27.670> not<00:02:27.790> checking<00:02:28.150> the<00:02:28.330> files

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
almost there it's not checking the files

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.320 
almost there it's not checking the files
and<00:02:28.989> here<00:02:29.170> we<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.340> once<00:02:30.610> you<00:02:30.730> get<00:02:30.910> to<00:02:30.940> here

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
and here we go so once you get to here

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.150 
and here we go so once you get to here
you<00:02:31.989> can<00:02:32.140> choose<00:02:32.290> to<00:02:32.350> either<00:02:32.500> manually<00:02:32.950> reboot

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
you can choose to either manually reboot

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.490 
you can choose to either manually reboot
later<00:02:33.489> or<00:02:33.820> we<00:02:34.180> but<00:02:34.390> now<00:02:34.570> to<00:02:34.959> finish<00:02:35.230> the

later or we but now to finish the
installation<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.489> I'm<00:02:36.549> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.850> reboot<00:02:37.239> now

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299

i'm using my virtual machine to

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:48.590 
i'm using my virtual machine to
demonstrate<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.550> reboot<00:02:47.940> so<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.270> i<00:02:48.330> can<00:02:48.390> use

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
demonstrate the reboot so that i can use

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.570

installed ubuntu on this virtual machine

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.430 
installed ubuntu on this virtual machine

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
reboot it will probably look a bit

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.610 
reboot it will probably look a bit
simpler<00:03:12.210> than<00:03:12.300> this<00:03:12.510> we've<00:03:13.050> just<00:03:13.080> your
