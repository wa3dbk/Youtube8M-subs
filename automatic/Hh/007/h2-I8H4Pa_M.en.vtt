00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
and the entire line and try to get as

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.060 
and the entire line and try to get as
much<00:01:24.890> of<00:01:24.950> the<00:01:25.190> air<00:01:25.540> as<00:01:26.540> possible<00:01:27.290> out<00:01:27.680> of<00:01:27.950> the

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:28.070 
much of the air as possible out of the

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
piece and that will stop the fluid from

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.120 
piece and that will stop the fluid from
coming<00:01:40.610> out<00:01:40.729> of<00:01:40.850> the<00:01:40.970> line<00:01:41.119> and<00:01:42.070> then<00:01:43.070> you

coming out of the line and then you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.580 
coming out of the line and then you
could<00:01:43.310> put<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.580> cat<00:01:43.820> back<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.360> if<00:01:45.320> there's

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
could put the cat back on if there's

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.870 
could put the cat back on if there's
still<00:01:45.830> some<00:01:46.189> air<00:01:46.460> in<00:01:46.790> the<00:01:47.000> line<00:01:47.210> it's<00:01:47.990> okay<00:01:48.470> a

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:48.880 
still some air in the line it's okay a

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.520 
still some air in the line it's okay a
small<00:01:49.880> amount<00:01:50.119> of<00:01:50.240> air<00:01:50.479> going<00:01:50.509> under<00:01:51.110> the<00:01:51.229> skin

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
small amount of air going under the skin

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.980 
small amount of air going under the skin
is<00:01:51.830> not<00:01:52.070> going<00:01:52.310> to<00:01:52.400> be<00:01:52.520> terribly<00:01:52.880> harmful<00:01:55.990> then
