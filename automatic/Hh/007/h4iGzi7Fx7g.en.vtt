00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
red stone or you can eat you can remove

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.949 
red stone or you can eat you can remove
red<00:02:55.620> stone<00:02:55.890> or<00:02:56.069> our<00:02:56.250> RS<00:02:56.940> box<00:02:57.660> set<00:02:57.989> output<00:02:59.959> and

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
red stone or our RS box set output and

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:08.349 
red stone or our RS box set output and
then<00:03:01.640> inverted<00:03:02.640> commas<00:03:03.000> right<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.340> then<00:03:05.549> true

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:08.359 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:10.690 

because<00:03:09.359> what<00:03:09.540> you<00:03:09.630> do<00:03:09.750> is<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.019> get<00:03:10.170> the

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
because what you do is you get the

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.920 
because what you do is you get the
argument<00:03:12.350> which<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.380> whether<00:03:14.280> side<00:03:14.609> it<00:03:14.790> is<00:03:14.930> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
argument which is whether side it is and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.030 
argument which is whether side it is and
then<00:03:17.480> your<00:03:18.650> ruling<00:03:19.650> which<00:03:20.579> is<00:03:20.760> either<00:03:20.970> true<00:03:21.420> or

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
then your ruling which is either true or

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:30.530 
then your ruling which is either true or
false<00:03:24.200> obviously<00:03:28.880> and<00:03:29.880> then<00:03:30.060> what<00:03:30.209> you<00:03:30.299> do

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
false obviously and then what you do

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.670 
false obviously and then what you do
then<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.140> you<00:03:31.200> make<00:03:31.739> it<00:03:31.920> sleep<00:03:32.250> I<00:03:33.470> just<00:03:34.470> type

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
then is you make it sleep I just type

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:42.600 
then is you make it sleep I just type
them<00:03:34.829> in<00:03:35.010> sleep

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:42.610 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:49.930 

so<00:03:43.610> I<00:03:44.000> just<00:03:44.239> might<00:03:44.390> mind<00:03:44.690> flight<00:03:48.310> sleep<00:03:49.310> how

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
so I just might mind flight sleep how

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.790 
so I just might mind flight sleep how
many<00:03:50.180> seconds<00:03:50.690> because<00:03:50.900> this<00:03:51.080> is<00:03:51.230> in<00:03:51.349> second

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
many seconds because this is in second

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.130 
many seconds because this is in second
list<00:03:52.040> I'm<00:03:52.970> going<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.180> make<00:03:53.269> it<00:03:53.420> sleep<00:03:53.690> of<00:03:53.870> three

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
list I'm going to make it sleep of three

00:03:54.140 --> 00:04:03.190 
list I'm going to make it sleep of three
seconds<00:03:56.799> and<00:03:57.799> then<00:03:59.650> RS<00:04:00.650> got<00:04:00.890> set<00:04:01.160> output<00:04:02.200> and

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
seconds and then RS got set output and

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.390 
seconds and then RS got set output and
because<00:04:03.530> we've<00:04:03.739> made<00:04:04.370> it<00:04:04.549> true<00:04:04.790> we<00:04:05.060> need<00:04:05.209> to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
because we've made it true we need to

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.140 
because we've made it true we need to
false<00:04:07.400> it<00:04:07.959> so<00:04:08.959> just<00:04:08.989> be<00:04:09.580> and<00:04:10.580> then<00:04:10.819> that's<00:04:11.060> that

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
false it so just be and then that's that

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:16.629 
false it so just be and then that's that
bun<00:04:11.480> and<00:04:11.810> they<00:04:11.900> do<00:04:12.140> else<00:04:12.410> and<00:04:14.769> LS<00:04:15.769> stop<00:04:16.160> shut

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:16.639 
bun and they do else and LS stop shut

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:22.240 
bun and they do else and LS stop shut
down<00:04:17.650> hello<00:04:18.790> go<00:04:19.790> somewhere<00:04:20.150> um<00:04:20.889> but<00:04:21.889> then<00:04:22.040> what

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
down hello go somewhere um but then what

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.830 
down hello go somewhere um but then what
you<00:04:22.370> can<00:04:22.400> also<00:04:22.700> do<00:04:23.000> is<00:04:23.150> this<00:04:23.950> OS<00:04:24.950> stop<00:04:25.250> pull

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
you can also do is this OS stop pull

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:34.000 
you can also do is this OS stop pull
event<00:04:28.060> equals<00:04:29.060> full<00:04:29.570> event<00:04:30.729> raw<00:04:31.960> or<00:04:32.960> draw<00:04:33.560> I

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
event equals full event raw or draw I

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.820 
event equals full event raw or draw I
think<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.520> is<00:04:34.550> and<00:04:35.479> now<00:04:35.720> I've<00:04:35.840> never<00:04:36.260> used<00:04:36.590> that

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
think it is and now I've never used that

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.980 
think it is and now I've never used that
but<00:04:37.340> people<00:04:37.550> keep<00:04:37.850> on<00:04:38.000> telling<00:04:38.330> me<00:04:38.360> to<00:04:38.570> use<00:04:38.780> it

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
but people keep on telling me to use it

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:56.950 
but people keep on telling me to use it
I<00:04:39.789> can<00:04:40.789> try<00:04:41.000> it<00:04:42.340> yeah

put something like that in it or make it
so<00:05:11.070> the<00:05:11.540> computer<00:05:12.540> isn't<00:05:12.960> able<00:05:13.500> to<00:05:13.920> be

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
so the computer isn't able to be

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.980 
so the computer isn't able to be
terminated<00:05:15.260> air<00:05:16.260> close<00:05:16.650> I<00:05:17.390> just<00:05:18.390> do<00:05:18.540> that<00:05:18.720> so

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:18.990 
terminated air close I just do that so

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:25.940 
terminated air close I just do that so
it's<00:05:19.140> easy<00:05:23.630> and<00:05:24.630> then<00:05:24.840> come<00:05:25.470> down<00:05:25.500> right<00:05:25.890> to

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
it's easy and then come down right to

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.640 
it's easy and then come down right to
the<00:05:26.130> bottom<00:05:26.340> so<00:05:27.800> OS<00:05:28.800> that<00:05:28.980> shut<00:05:29.220> down<00:05:29.430> typing

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:30.650 
the bottom so OS that shut down typing

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:36.410 
the bottom so OS that shut down typing
no.50<00:05:31.970> and<00:05:33.320> so<00:05:34.320> what<00:05:34.500> that<00:05:34.530> does<00:05:34.890> is<00:05:34.920> it<00:05:35.420> does

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.620 
this and then Oh No yeah oh no it's shut
my<00:05:40.500> computer<00:05:40.560> down<00:05:40.950> but<00:05:41.850> then<00:05:41.940> what<00:05:42.120> you<00:05:42.240> do<00:05:42.450> to

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:42.630 
my computer down but then what you do to

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.140 
my computer down but then what you do to
stop<00:05:42.930> that<00:05:43.220> you<00:05:44.220> don't<00:05:44.400> really<00:05:44.550> need<00:05:44.820> to<00:05:44.940> shut

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
stop that you don't really need to shut

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.520 
stop that you don't really need to shut
the<00:05:45.240> computer<00:05:45.390> down<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.960> can<00:05:46.140> just<00:05:46.350> make<00:05:46.500> it

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
the computer down you can just make it

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:53.260 
the computer down you can just make it
loop<00:05:46.860> on<00:05:47.300> loop<00:05:48.300> on<00:05:48.540> the<00:05:48.660> same<00:05:49.520> program<00:05:50.520> like<00:05:50.970> so

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
loop on loop on the same program like so

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.960 
loop on loop on the same program like so
if<00:05:54.270> i<00:05:54.390> come<00:05:54.570> back<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.900> where<00:05:55.110> i<00:05:55.970> delete

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970 
if i come back to where i delete

00:05:56.970 --> 00:06:02.120 
if i come back to where i delete
everything<00:05:57.360> here<00:05:57.920> and<00:05:58.920> then<00:05:59.100> type<00:05:59.340> in<00:06:01.130> shell

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
everything here and then type in shell

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:05.990 
everything here and then type in shell
got<00:06:03.090> run<00:06:03.710> and<00:06:04.710> then<00:06:04.950> whatever<00:06:05.400> this<00:06:05.490> program

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
got run and then whatever this program

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.070 
got run and then whatever this program
is<00:06:06.090> called<00:06:06.270> door<00:06:06.980> okay<00:06:07.980> so<00:06:08.540> so<00:06:09.540> for<00:06:09.690> every<00:06:09.870> time

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:10.080 
is called door okay so so for every time

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:16.070 
is called door okay so so for every time
if<00:06:10.350> i<00:06:10.500> put<00:06:10.680> door<00:06:11.180> it<00:06:12.180> shutting<00:06:13.140> down<00:06:14.540> for<00:06:15.540> what

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:16.080 
if i put door it shutting down for what
