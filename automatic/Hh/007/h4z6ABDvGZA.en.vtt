00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
particular on the rubbage strike where

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.270 
particular on the rubbage strike where
you<00:04:19.290> start<00:04:19.530> to<00:04:19.590> get<00:04:19.650> this<00:04:19.739> kind<00:04:19.829> of<00:04:20.010> sticky

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
you start to get this kind of sticky

get rid of it I think it comes from the
plastic<00:04:25.950> is<00:04:26.040> that<00:04:26.160> it's<00:04:26.280> almost<00:04:26.400> like<00:04:26.670> the
