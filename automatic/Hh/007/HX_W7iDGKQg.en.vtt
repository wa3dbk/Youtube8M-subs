they<00:01:16.060> were<00:01:16.179> like<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.450> last<00:01:16.630> thing<00:01:16.780> they<00:01:16.929> do

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:17.079 
they were like the last thing they do

00:01:17.079 --> 00:01:21.990 
they were like the last thing they do
they<00:01:17.289> were<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:19.090> no<00:01:19.479> one<00:01:19.780> makes<00:01:20.789> 60<00:01:21.789> point

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
they were and no one makes 60 point

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.349 
they were and no one makes 60 point
