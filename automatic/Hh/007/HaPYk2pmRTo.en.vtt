lighter<00:01:58.070> version<00:01:59.070> bikes<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.520> had<00:01:59.700> before

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
lighter version bikes that I had before

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.719 
lighter version bikes that I had before
I<00:02:00.409> found<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.590> they're<00:02:01.770> always<00:02:02.100> cracking<00:02:02.610> it

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
I found that they're always cracking it

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:03.709 
I found that they're always cracking it
as<00:02:02.850> a<00:02:02.880> matter<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.030> fact<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.270> bottom<00:02:03.540> tube

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
as a matter of fact the bottom tube

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:06.850 
as a matter of fact the bottom tube
cracked<00:02:04.079> on<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.399> carbon<00:02:05.640> fiber<00:02:05.790> bike

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
cracked on a carbon fiber bike

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.160 
cracked on a carbon fiber bike
had<00:02:07.040> before<00:02:07.460> which<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.210> why<00:02:08.330> we<00:02:08.539> updated<00:02:09.020> to

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
had before which is why we updated to

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.710 
had before which is why we updated to
the<00:02:09.200> specialized<00:02:09.820> this<00:02:10.820> specialized<00:02:11.330> model

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
the specialized this specialized model

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.050 
the specialized this specialized model
and<00:02:11.900> it<00:02:12.500> worked<00:02:12.680> out<00:02:12.800> very<00:02:12.860> very<00:02:13.250> well<00:02:13.520> so<00:02:14.030> I

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
and it worked out very very well so I

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:16.630 
and it worked out very very well so I
was<00:02:14.390> really<00:02:14.660> really<00:02:14.930> happy<00:02:15.140> with<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.530> any<00:02:16.400> kind

packing up our bikes and heading off to
my<00:03:09.200> lab<00:03:09.320> in<00:03:09.500> October<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:11.120> what<00:03:11.180> would<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.450> who

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
my lab in October and what would you who

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.990 
my lab in October and what would you who
would<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.900> recommend<00:03:12.049> despite<00:03:12.799> for<00:03:13.100> if<00:03:13.790> you

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
would you recommend despite for if you

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.600 
would you recommend despite for if you
were<00:03:14.120> if<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:15.080> had<00:03:15.230> to<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.890> recommend<00:03:16.400> it<00:03:16.519> yeah

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
were if you had to to recommend it yeah

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.860 
were if you had to to recommend it yeah
I<00:03:16.640> mean<00:03:16.940> it's<00:03:17.150> perfect<00:03:17.930> for<00:03:18.070> the<00:03:19.070> the<00:03:20.030> rider

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:20.870 
I mean it's perfect for the the rider

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.640 
I mean it's perfect for the the rider
who<00:03:21.470> is<00:03:21.890> a<00:03:21.950> little<00:03:22.489> bit<00:03:22.580> heavier<00:03:22.910> and<00:03:23.650> probably

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
who is a little bit heavier and probably

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.750 
who is a little bit heavier and probably
I'd<00:03:24.860> say<00:03:24.890> less<00:03:26.920> technically<00:03:27.920> savvy<00:03:28.190> and<00:03:28.519> less

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
I'd say less technically savvy and less

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220 
I'd say less technically savvy and less
concerned<00:03:29.209> about<00:03:29.299> missing<00:03:29.780> things<00:03:30.019> when

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
concerned about missing things when

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.660 
concerned about missing things when
they're<00:03:30.320> coming<00:03:30.590> down<00:03:30.620> through<00:03:31.040> the<00:03:31.160> trails<00:03:31.400> I

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
they're coming down through the trails I

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:34.150 
they're coming down through the trails I
mean<00:03:32.540> it's<00:03:32.840> a<00:03:32.959> great<00:03:33.080> bike<00:03:33.350> for<00:03:33.620> hammering<00:03:34.040> it

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:34.160 
mean it's a great bike for hammering it

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:37.539 
mean it's a great bike for hammering it
where<00:03:34.850> you're<00:03:35.630> going<00:03:35.750> to<00:03:35.810> be<00:03:35.870> safe<00:03:36.110> and<00:03:36.549> the

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
where you're going to be safe and the

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.810 
where you're going to be safe and the
bikes<00:03:37.730> going<00:03:37.880> to<00:03:37.970> hold<00:03:38.180> up<00:03:38.410> and<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:40.459> guys<00:03:40.610> I

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:40.820 
bikes going to hold up and the guys I

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:44.590 
bikes going to hold up and the guys I
think<00:03:40.850> that<00:03:41.209> around<00:03:41.480> the<00:03:41.690> one<00:03:41.870> 95<00:03:42.380> to<00:03:42.620> 20<00:03:42.799> 5<00:03:43.600> 6

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
think that around the one 95 to 20 5 6

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.229 
think that around the one 95 to 20 5 6
foot<00:03:44.840> 6<00:03:45.590> foot<00:03:45.890> range<00:03:46.100> I<00:03:46.340> think<00:03:46.610> it's<00:03:46.730> a<00:03:46.850> think

00:03:47.229 --> 00:03:47.239 
foot 6 foot range I think it's a think

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.900 
foot 6 foot range I think it's a think
it's<00:03:47.360> a<00:03:47.709> it's<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.860> best<00:03:49.100> you<00:03:49.250> can<00:03:49.370> do<00:03:49.580> it's<00:03:49.880> the

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
it's a it's the best you can do it's the

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.020 
it's a it's the best you can do it's the

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
best hybrid between the just a regular

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.810 
best hybrid between the just a regular
carbon<00:03:53.810> fiber<00:03:53.959> kind<00:03:54.650> of<00:03:54.739> race<00:03:55.010> bike<00:03:55.280> Epic's<00:03:55.670> if

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:55.820 
carbon fiber kind of race bike Epic's if

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.550 
carbon fiber kind of race bike Epic's if
you<00:03:55.910> will<00:03:56.060> and<00:03:56.299> the<00:03:56.570> downhill<00:03:56.959> so<00:03:57.380> it's<00:03:57.500> a

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:57.560 
you will and the downhill so it's a

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:59.920 
you will and the downhill so it's a
great<00:03:57.650> hybrid<00:03:58.160> for<00:03:58.370> that<00:03:58.519> in<00:03:59.480> terms<00:03:59.660> of<00:03:59.780> being

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
great hybrid for that in terms of being

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:02.310 
great hybrid for that in terms of being
a<00:03:59.989> little<00:04:00.170> bit<00:04:00.320> more<00:04:00.519> suited<00:04:01.519> for<00:04:01.549> those<00:04:01.820> guys
