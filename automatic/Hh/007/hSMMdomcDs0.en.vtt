00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:46.730 
magic dispenser is one of the big key
attributes<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.270> the<00:01:45.360> product<00:01:45.690> itself<00:01:46.049> mixing

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
attributes to the product itself mixing

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.710 
attributes to the product itself mixing
the<00:01:46.890> detergent<00:01:47.520> so<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> don't<00:01:48.180> get<00:01:48.330> clocks

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the detergent so you don't get clocks

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.660 
the detergent so you don't get clocks
within<00:01:49.290> the<00:01:49.380> dispenser<00:01:49.979> or<00:01:50.010> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> clothing

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
within the dispenser or on the clothing

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.460 
within the dispenser or on the clothing
and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.360> think<00:01:51.570> one<00:01:51.659> of<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.810> biggest<00:01:52.080> things<00:01:52.320> is

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
and I think one of the biggest things is

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.410 
and I think one of the biggest things is
what<00:01:52.650> we<00:01:52.740> call<00:01:52.890> our<00:01:53.010> wobble<00:01:53.310> technology<00:01:53.880> so

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
what we call our wobble technology so

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.870 
what we call our wobble technology so
wobble<00:01:54.720> technology<00:01:55.320> reduces<00:01:56.190> tangling<00:01:56.760> of

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
wobble technology reduces tangling of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.120 
wobble technology reduces tangling of
the<00:01:57.030> clothing<00:01:57.510> so<00:01:57.900> cleans<00:01:58.320> better<00:01:58.590> cleans

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
the clothing so cleans better cleans

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.710 
the clothing so cleans better cleans
easier<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.850> the<00:01:59.939> of<00:02:00.030> course<00:02:00.060> gives<00:02:00.540> the

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
easier and the of course gives the
