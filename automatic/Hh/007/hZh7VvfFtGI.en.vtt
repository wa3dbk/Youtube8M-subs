00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:10.720
 when I first arrived here I saw the 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:14.010
 City of Angels feels weird 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.840
 because you see many lights many cars 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.720
 you feel like you're in the country of 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.369
 wonders 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.890
 I swear that if there was a wand 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.199
 magic will ask me what do you want to be 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.880
 for your next life if there is me 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.400
 say what 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.610
 say it all as it is 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.440
 as my big dreams really help 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.350
 to my community to my servant sisters 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.640
 our genres because I am one of 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.640
 she is one of the victims 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.100
 rest from hello and it costs me 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.019
 see you way justified low software 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.659
 criminally with up to four divisions 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:57.809
 whitman personal walking and leader 

00:00:54.659 --> 00:00:59.399
 against the abuses were several 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.920
 addresses is tobacco they tied me of my 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:04.339
 feet we shoot to rape me for 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.339
 find me 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.270
 i 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.840
 beyond that way explanation 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.840
 revival of the chasing software generates 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.130
 a great tourism with the asylum case and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.450
 I am going to turn five tomorrow tomorrow 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.420
 will decide 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.969
 If I win or lose the case, I think it 's 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.740
 better to risk crossing 

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:41.740
 risk losing my life in my country 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.159
 and I do not feel sorry because it's my life and 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.799
 is what I experienced from what I am going to follow 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.799
 living are the remains of my of my life 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.860
 Amen
