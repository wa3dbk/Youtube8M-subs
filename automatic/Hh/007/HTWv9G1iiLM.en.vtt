00:02:08.309 --> 00:02:08.319 
now let's talk about this module that we

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.109 
now let's talk about this module that we
got<00:02:08.470> over<00:02:08.619> here<00:02:08.920> first<00:02:09.550> right<00:02:09.670> off<00:02:09.789> the<00:02:09.879> bat

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
got over here first right off the bat

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.570 
got over here first right off the bat
you<00:02:10.330> got<00:02:10.539> your<00:02:10.780> save<00:02:11.440> feature<00:02:11.860> so<00:02:12.250> if<00:02:12.340> you<00:02:12.430> want

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
you got your save feature so if you want

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.920 
you got your save feature so if you want
to<00:02:12.670> lay<00:02:12.730> down<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:12.910> beat<00:02:13.150> record<00:02:13.629> it<00:02:13.720> right<00:02:13.840> into

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
to lay down a beat record it right into

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.630 
to lay down a beat record it right into
the<00:02:14.080> module<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.590> can<00:02:14.650> do<00:02:14.920> that<00:02:15.129> you<00:02:15.610> can

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
the module you can do that you can

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.429 
the module you can do that you can
always<00:02:16.000> go<00:02:16.150> back<00:02:16.300> to<00:02:16.360> it<00:02:16.660> and<00:02:16.780> reference<00:02:17.140> it<00:02:17.319> if

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:17.439 
always go back to it and reference it if

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:17.870 
always go back to it and reference it if
you're<00:02:17.560> gonna

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
you're gonna

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.990 
you're gonna
use<00:02:18.000> it<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.290> multiple<00:02:19.290> drum<00:02:19.530> tracks<00:02:19.920> or<00:02:20.610> if

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
use it for multiple drum tracks or if

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.790 
use it for multiple drum tracks or if
you<00:02:21.120> just<00:02:21.170> immediately<00:02:22.170> want<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> record

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
you just immediately want to record

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.080 
you just immediately want to record
something<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.280> beat<00:02:23.490> that's<00:02:23.670> been<00:02:23.820> flying

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
something to beat that's been flying

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.370 
something to beat that's been flying
around<00:02:24.180> in<00:02:24.420> your<00:02:24.480> head<00:02:24.600> and<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> got<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.260> get

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
around in your head and you got to get

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.810 
around in your head and you got to get
it<00:02:25.500> down<00:02:25.650> you<00:02:25.710> can<00:02:25.980> record<00:02:26.220> it<00:02:26.340> to<00:02:26.460> this<00:02:26.610> thing

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
it down you can record it to this thing

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.020 
it down you can record it to this thing
really<00:02:27.120> easily<00:02:27.570> so<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.440> back<00:02:28.650> we<00:02:29.550> have<00:02:29.580> the

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
really easily so on the back we have the

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280 
really easily so on the back we have the
ability<00:02:30.360> to<00:02:30.390> obviously<00:02:30.810> put<00:02:30.990> your<00:02:31.110> headphones

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290
