roof back up with the key and the lock
button

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 

takes<00:01:03.630> about<00:01:03.870> 30<00:01:04.199> seconds<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.739> put<00:01:04.980> the<00:01:05.129> roof

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.570 
takes about 30 seconds to put the roof
back<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.270> notice<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.470> I<00:01:07.740> removed<00:01:08.370> the

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.050 
safety stop that they provided

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.870 
safety stop that they provided
originally<00:01:13.050> so<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.650> roof<00:01:13.830> just<00:01:14.070> closes<00:01:14.580> fully

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880
