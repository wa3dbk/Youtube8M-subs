SMGs<00:00:39.059> apparently<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.930> gun<00:00:40.200> here<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.620> MP<00:00:40.920> 11

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
SMGs apparently this gun here the MP 11

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.180 
SMGs apparently this gun here the MP 11
is<00:00:41.520> an<00:00:42.000> absolute<00:00:42.570> monster<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.290> my<00:00:43.590> opinion<00:00:43.890> I

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
is an absolute monster in my opinion I

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.860 
is an absolute monster in my opinion I
think<00:00:44.219> it<00:00:44.520> was<00:00:44.610> fine<00:00:44.850> before<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:45.510> guys<00:00:45.690> can

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
think it was fine before as you guys can

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.170 
think it was fine before as you guys can
see<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.230> game<00:00:46.440> play<00:00:46.680> I'm<00:00:46.920> melting<00:00:47.550> people

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
see in this game play I'm melting people

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.569 
see in this game play I'm melting people
with<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> suppressor<00:00:48.750> on<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.289> gun<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.770> in

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
with the suppressor on this gun and in

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.130 
with the suppressor on this gun and in
my<00:00:50.670> opinion<00:00:50.789> I<00:00:51.210> think<00:00:51.239> they've<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:51.780> of

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
my opinion I think they've kind of

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.750 
my opinion I think they've kind of
stuffed<00:00:52.500> up<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.860> weapon<00:00:53.160> balancing<00:00:53.610> right

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
stuffed up the weapon balancing right

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.450 
stuffed up the weapon balancing right
here<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.570> along<00:00:54.870> with<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.079> this<00:00:55.829> gun<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.190> MP

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
here so along with that this gun the MP

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.330 
here so along with that this gun the MP
11<00:00:56.850> they've<00:00:57.000> also<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.420> buff<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:57.960> ASM<00:00:58.739> one<00:00:58.949> in

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
11 they've also a buff that ASM one in

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.549 
11 they've also a buff that ASM one in
my<00:00:59.699> opinion<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.329> think<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.870> gun<00:01:01.079> did<00:01:01.320> need<00:01:01.530> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
my opinion I think that gun did need a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.590 
my opinion I think that gun did need a
bar<00:01:01.800> fight<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.579> know<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.879> my<00:01:02.910> opinion<00:01:03.300> I<00:01:03.570> think

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
bar fight you know in my opinion I think

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660 
bar fight you know in my opinion I think
that<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.140> gun<00:01:04.619> was<00:01:04.650> just<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.100> hip<00:01:05.309> marking

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
that that gun was just the hip marking

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.570 
that that gun was just the hip marking
machine<00:01:05.970> so<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.960> know<00:01:07.350> they<00:01:07.530> bucked<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.979> SMGs

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
machine so you know they bucked the SMGs

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.300 
machine so you know they bucked the SMGs
and<00:01:08.880> nerf<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> ARS<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> my<00:01:10.350> opinion<00:01:10.650> I<00:01:10.950> think

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
and nerf the ARS in my opinion I think

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
and nerf the ARS in my opinion I think
they<00:01:11.760> should<00:01:11.970> have<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.240> nerfed<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.689> ars<00:01:13.140> and

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
they should have just nerfed the ars and

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.560 
they should have just nerfed the ars and
that<00:01:13.650> would<00:01:13.950> have<00:01:14.040> been<00:01:14.130> fine<00:01:14.430> but<00:01:15.030> now<00:01:15.240> it

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
that would have been fine but now it

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.929 
that would have been fine but now it
looks<00:01:15.810> like<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.619> SMGs<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.670> going<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.880> be

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
looks like that the SMGs are going to be

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.940 
looks like that the SMGs are going to be
more<00:01:18.150> dominant<00:01:18.509> in<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.110> game<00:01:19.350> which<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.619> kind

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
more dominant in this game which is kind

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
more dominant in this game which is kind
of<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.100> bad<00:01:20.310> thing<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.790> wanted<00:01:21.030> to<00:01:21.090> be<00:01:21.270> balanced

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
of a bad thing I wanted to be balanced

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.350 
of a bad thing I wanted to be balanced
where<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:22.860> can<00:01:23.280> use<00:01:23.430> SMGs<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.210> you

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
where you know you can use SMGs and you

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.149 
where you know you can use SMGs and you
can<00:01:24.479> use<00:01:24.630> a<00:01:24.810> RS<00:01:25.170> and<00:01:25.320> they're<00:01:25.470> both<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.890> good<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
can use a RS and they're both as good as

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.550 
can use a RS and they're both as good as
each<00:01:26.310> other<00:01:26.460> now<00:01:27.240> it<00:01:27.630> looks<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.380> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
each other now it looks like that the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.410 
each other now it looks like that the
SMGs<00:01:29.040> are<00:01:29.220> more<00:01:29.369> dominant<00:01:29.759> instead<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
SMGs are more dominant instead of the

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420 
SMGs are more dominant instead of the
ARS<00:01:30.780> at<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:30.960> beginning<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.409> the<00:01:31.470> game<00:01:31.650> so

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
ARS at the beginning of the game so

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.920 
ARS at the beginning of the game so
another<00:01:32.729> thing<00:01:32.820> that<00:01:33.180> they've<00:01:33.420> recently

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
another thing that they've recently

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.499 
another thing that they've recently

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
changed is that the point system is a

bit you know out of hand in my opinion

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.190 
bit you know out of hand in my opinion
in<00:01:39.619> domination<00:01:40.619> you<00:01:41.189> now<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:42.200> hundred

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
in domination you now get a hundred

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.100 
in domination you now get a hundred
points<00:01:43.590> per<00:01:44.100> kill<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.700> now<00:01:45.360> when<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.780> capture

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
points per kill and now when you capture

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.870 
points per kill and now when you capture
a<00:01:46.140> flag<00:01:46.409> it's<00:01:46.680> 200<00:01:47.159> points<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.610> when<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.790> get

a capture kill you get 175 points now

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.960 
a capture kill you get 175 points now
previously<00:01:51.380> you<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.680> 50<00:01:53.159> points<00:01:53.369> for<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.670> kill

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
previously you got 50 points for a kill

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.530 
previously you got 50 points for a kill
and<00:01:54.149> you<00:01:54.840> got<00:01:55.189> 150<00:01:56.189> points<00:01:56.430> for<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.790> capture<00:01:57.299> and

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
and you got 150 points for a capture and

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.700 
and you got 150 points for a capture and
then<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.500> got<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.040> think<00:01:59.630> 125<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.320> capture

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
then you got I think 125 for a capture

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.639 
then you got I think 125 for a capture
kill<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.640> 25<00:02:03.090> points<00:02:03.540> for<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:04.049> assists

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
kill and then 25 points for and assists

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.399 
kill and then 25 points for and assists
and<00:02:04.799> now<00:02:04.950> it's<00:02:05.189> 50<00:02:05.610> for<00:02:05.820> an<00:02:05.909> assists<00:02:06.329> or<00:02:06.450> 75<00:02:07.229> or

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
and now it's 50 for an assists or 75 or

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:09.499 
and now it's 50 for an assists or 75 or
something<00:02:07.619> like<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:08.220> in<00:02:08.759> my<00:02:08.910> opinion<00:02:09.030> I

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
something like that so in my opinion I

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.570 
something like that so in my opinion I
think<00:02:09.539> they've<00:02:09.899> screwed<00:02:10.259> this<00:02:10.440> up<00:02:10.590> a<00:02:10.739> bit<00:02:10.770> most

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
think they've screwed this up a bit most

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.070 
think they've screwed this up a bit most
of<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> time<00:02:11.970> when<00:02:12.150> i'm<00:02:12.300> joining<00:02:12.540> games<00:02:12.840> and

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
of the time when i'm joining games and

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.910 
of the time when i'm joining games and
stuff<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.470> when<00:02:13.770> I'm

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
stuff like that when I'm

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.190 
stuff like that when I'm
on<00:02:13.980> a<00:02:14.040> streak<00:02:14.340> all<00:02:14.940> I<00:02:15.000> can<00:02:15.480> hear<00:02:15.720> is<00:02:15.750> enemy

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
on a streak all I can hear is enemy

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.140 
on a streak all I can hear is enemy
system<00:02:16.650> hack<00:02:16.800> enemy<00:02:17.310> bombing<00:02:17.700> run<00:02:17.849> and<00:02:18.000> stuff

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
system hack enemy bombing run and stuff

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.660 
system hack enemy bombing run and stuff
like<00:02:18.360> that<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.870> in<00:02:19.319> my<00:02:19.560> opinion<00:02:19.680> I<00:02:20.160> think<00:02:20.190> it's

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
like that so in my opinion I think it's

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.750 
like that so in my opinion I think it's
way<00:02:20.940> too<00:02:21.000> easy<00:02:21.569> to<00:02:21.989> get<00:02:22.260> streaks<00:02:22.620> now<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.190> mean

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
way too easy to get streaks now I mean

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.900 
way too easy to get streaks now I mean
before<00:02:24.000> you<00:02:24.239> know<00:02:24.630> with<00:02:25.080> my<00:02:25.260> UAV<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.220> UAV<00:02:26.730> that

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
before you know with my UAV the UAV that

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.930 
before you know with my UAV the UAV that
cost<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.270> 1200<00:02:28.260> points<00:02:28.440> that's<00:02:29.430> used<00:02:29.849> to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
cost like 1200 points that's used to

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.090 
cost like 1200 points that's used to
take<00:02:30.180> me<00:02:30.360> 20<00:02:30.810> kills<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.380> get<00:02:31.560> without<00:02:31.890> any

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
take me 20 kills to get without any

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.880 
take me 20 kills to get without any
captures<00:02:32.610> now<00:02:33.209> it<00:02:33.390> takes<00:02:33.569> me<00:02:33.810> like<00:02:33.989> five<00:02:34.500> kills

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
captures now it takes me like five kills

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.640 
captures now it takes me like five kills
and<00:02:35.100> a<00:02:35.160> capture<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.760> get<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.150> UAV<00:02:36.690> which<00:02:37.350> in

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
and a capture to get that UAV which in

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.340 
and a capture to get that UAV which in
my<00:02:37.830> opinion<00:02:37.950> is<00:02:38.520> good<00:02:38.819> for<00:02:39.060> me<00:02:39.090> but<00:02:39.900> it's<00:02:40.080> also

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
my opinion is good for me but it's also

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.979 
my opinion is good for me but it's also
bad<00:02:40.860> because<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:42.239> know<00:02:42.360> enemies<00:02:42.780> can

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
bad because that you know enemies can

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:45.650 
bad because that you know enemies can
now<00:02:43.140> get<00:02:43.410> streaks<00:02:43.769> a<00:02:44.040> lot<00:02:44.400> easier<00:02:44.640> I<00:02:45.180> mean<00:02:45.480> I

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
now get streaks a lot easier I mean I

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.590 
now get streaks a lot easier I mean I
know<00:02:46.440> that<00:02:46.860> they're<00:02:47.040> trying<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.569> you<00:02:48.569> know

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
know that they're trying to you know

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.840 
know that they're trying to you know
make<00:02:49.230> it<00:02:49.440> better<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:49.800> the<00:02:50.040> people<00:02:50.190> that<00:02:50.430> are

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
make it better for the people that are

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.030 
make it better for the people that are
you<00:02:51.420> know<00:02:51.540> just<00:02:51.750> casual<00:02:52.230> players<00:02:52.500> people<00:02:52.920> that

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
you know just casual players people that

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.610 
you know just casual players people that
just<00:02:53.220> play<00:02:53.459> once<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.360> a<00:02:54.450> while<00:02:54.660> but<00:02:55.440> they

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
just play once in a while but they

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.130 
just play once in a while but they
really<00:02:55.860> need<00:02:56.160> to<00:02:56.220> focus<00:02:56.400> more<00:02:56.970> on<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:58.019> know

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
really need to focus more on you know

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.660 
really need to focus more on you know
the<00:02:58.260> people<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.680> do<00:02:58.890> play<00:02:59.160> a<00:02:59.190> lot<00:02:59.430> people

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
the people that do play a lot people

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.150 
the people that do play a lot people
that<00:03:00.000> actually<00:03:00.380> enjoy<00:03:01.380> call<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.799> duty<00:03:02.130> and

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
that actually enjoy call of duty and

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.300 
that actually enjoy call of duty and
they<00:03:02.519> play<00:03:02.819> it<00:03:03.000> religiously<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.590> in<00:03:05.100> my

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
they play it religiously so in my

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.370 
they play it religiously so in my
opinion<00:03:05.430> I<00:03:05.910> think<00:03:05.940> they<00:03:06.450> have<00:03:06.690> kind<00:03:07.049> of<00:03:07.170> messed

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:07.380 
opinion I think they have kind of messed

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:09.680 
opinion I think they have kind of messed
up<00:03:07.590> this<00:03:07.769> patch<00:03:08.040> with<00:03:08.670> the<00:03:08.819> weapon<00:03:09.150> balancing

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
up this patch with the weapon balancing

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.080 
up this patch with the weapon balancing
and<00:03:09.860> along<00:03:10.860> with<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.160> point<00:03:11.430> system<00:03:11.819> as<00:03:11.940> well

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
and along with the point system as well

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.059 
and along with the point system as well
I<00:03:12.150> think<00:03:12.390> it's<00:03:12.720> way<00:03:12.900> too<00:03:12.959> easy<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.590> get<00:03:13.680> streaks

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
I think it's way too easy to get streaks

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:17.690 
I think it's way too easy to get streaks
I<00:03:14.340> mean<00:03:14.880> I<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.540> spam<00:03:15.840> UAVs<00:03:16.560> all<00:03:17.220> game

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
I mean I can just spam UAVs all game

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.479 
I mean I can just spam UAVs all game
have<00:03:18.359> a<00:03:18.390> constant<00:03:18.959> UAV<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:20.010> for<00:03:20.250> the<00:03:20.310> whole

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
have a constant UAV up for the whole

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.970 
have a constant UAV up for the whole
game<00:03:20.700> and<00:03:21.109> along<00:03:22.109> with<00:03:22.140> that<00:03:22.260> you<00:03:22.709> know<00:03:22.739> that

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
game and along with that you know that

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:24.530
