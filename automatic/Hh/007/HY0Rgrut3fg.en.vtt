00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 people it's as if today we 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.350
 finds himself for a little bit a little bit special 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.559
 yes since I'm going to talk to you 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.599
 today of audiovisual school because 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.040
 so just right back I 'm just 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:15.929
 put a little gameplay or two it depends 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 the time I would put ben talks 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.480
 So here it is to occupy you 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.369
 while I speak 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.720
 so yes the audiovisual schools I 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.100
 speak because I find it really 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.260
 important is that we are on youtube on 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.529
 is most concerned with the domain 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:31.289
 audiovisual in the sense that we do 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.640
 all montages have finally done for 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.989
 publishers did a lot of things 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.489
 for the graphic artists the fictional gels 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.410
 can a lot of things as good the 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.629
 eyes on the pure players - but it takes 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.230
 still that's a hell I think 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.719
 that this is an area that interests 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.920
 a lot of people and it's true that ben 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.300
 in terminal when you are asked to 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.340
 to choose must go fast must already 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.930
 prepare what you are going to have 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.270
 a little idea otherwise you will avoid 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.219
 lost it's going really fast so I know 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.500
 well the date continues so for those who 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.079
 are not in terminal to date to enter 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.239
 schools passed except that it 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.440
 walk by the apb system brief ago 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.730
 the elected most schools are in 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.049
 a baby but I will tell you about school 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.780
 who are still out of a pv whose you 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.710
 can still register 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.540
 maybe give names etc 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.820
 finally the audiovisual schools it's 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.320
 often the galley because in fact they 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.850
 offer you most training 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.000
 in three years that is to say that it is a 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.159
 bachelor and so you have either a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.170
 small prep of one year + 3 years is 3 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.509
 indirectly but points with three years 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.330
 but a lot of people do that a lot 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.740
 a lot of people do that and three years has 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.820
 erased too short in fact now he 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.560
 are a lot of people coming out of 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.460
 these schools and to stand out it's 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.290
 really impossible 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.720
 it's really not impossible but 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.799
 it's very very difficult so when I 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.659
 say that's when I 'll do when I 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.740
 talking about these schools threatened a lot 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.530
 everything was going very much all that they 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.909
 would have audiovisuals for example 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.119
 Audiovisual basins not basic but 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.130
 to make directors of the flaws 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.899
 coming up hall a little things a little 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.640
 little more specialized 20 - specialized 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.320
 much more generalist for example 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.899
 in not for all cases special effects 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.430
 you are a rigger fiddler here you 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:01.860
 are after three years you go out and 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.630
 here you are a little bit a little 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.950
 little dad you're not benefited by 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.030
 relationship to the rest of the people since you 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.110
 did just about everything that all the 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.869
 world made for sale 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 so often actually especially at the level 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.910
 special effects because I was 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.300
 really in the special effects 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.380
 last year it's actually the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.510
 problem is that we often have the status 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.120
 intermittent spectacle ie 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.350
 that we take you on a film then after 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.030
 with the movie for example to make the 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.560
 special effects do not transform I do not 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.640
 take for example and apple in order to 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.900
 transform I have you got fired from the 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.460
 box and you have to actually find 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.380
 you find a contract by a contract 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.640
 you are not caught you were found 

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.110
 to give you all the time move in 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.340
 is that the problem and I talked 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.540
 with people who told me but me 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.860
 I had all the united states I was 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.180
 machine the eagle and I was doing that 

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.220
 to move because in the volume can not even 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.070
 France and that slab in France and that's it 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.480
 so it's great galley so frankly 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:47.670
 in three years and ben I did not want 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.080
 do decor in three years so I'm 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.480
 maybe give you names in school 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.650
 of three years who are still in rap and b 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.850
 for those who are finished with who 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.370
 might want to add something 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.239
 Meme it thing to register so a baby ago 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:01.440
 the will of paris 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:03.000
 serra ago there will leave and pretty much 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.880
 really I know even more than there will be 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.920
 pb after there is all that is school him 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
 light and femis are two schools 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.510
 very well known and then here at the level 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.299
 and the shortest courses this 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.700
 are two bts the audiovisual tests there 

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.720
 there are many but are dazed with 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.430
 who form a painter a 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.110
 direct specialization for example you 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.120
 does a bts age and I put in want 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.340
 less well we want to be more of 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.630
 relief is actually I think I 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.739
 think continue if I do that by 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.299
 example in a bts and I continue 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:33.330
 even in a school after I mean 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.220
 the bts is for example mounting 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.410
 postproduction bts framing bts 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.480
 production techniques of things 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.920
 so that's very very targeted so that 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.269
 lasts two years after you can 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.420
 working directly can make a 

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:46.470
 professional license or you can 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:48.830
 continue on our school like at a 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.910
 school known as the femis for example 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.760
 and then after you have everything that is 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:56.610
 a university a few universities there in 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.200
 have no masses who propose to you 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.430
 so trained to something 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.330
 Audiovisual often it's not all that 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.390
 which is special is too much 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.320
 technique is rather the realization 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.540
 even if at monta edger truquist 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.640
 exterio nas so it's master license 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.160
 all three in ten years before the master 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.760
 douglas is already more 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:16.070
 more how would I say to have longer longer 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.110
 that others are more rewarding 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:19.730
 but then we have less practice too 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:20.870
 form within a month of contacts 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:22.100
 stage since the importance in 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.600
 other schools is that it gives good 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.190
 good internships could pass a wind to 

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.070
 abroad etc to make contacts 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.150
 to see you familiarize a language I 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.530
 I'm not going to spend a year I was at 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:33.410
 united states give you almost empty to 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.060
 a way there but there the universities and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.860
 even the universities do not offer 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.090
 so many trips and not all 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:39.500
 techniques 

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.850
 when we do Greek university closes in 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.710
 have technical knowledge but 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.390
 also a cultural recognition and 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.010
 bomba evidence and more valued on 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.560
 the evenings because it's been five years 

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:49.910
 but hey that's not giving in to 

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.990
 search to find what is needed because 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.770
 that these are a lot related to 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.870
 the art on paris to complaints of ya 2-3 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.610
 sorbonne university new asks the 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:00.770
 valette took in a lot more seeing 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.870
 the reception very little since finally you 

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.030
 did I talk about my case I had 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:06.110
 my first wish so a school I can 

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.460
 say it now because I refuse 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.070
 no competition since it's over 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.320
 but an audiovisual school on 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.870
 valenciennes who only takes bac s to 1 

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:16.190
 out of 10 for here a little bit of 

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:17.330
 selections but also a school 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.920
 academic who walks the system 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.180
 master license so it's not a 

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:22.700
 university is a school that works 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:26.240
 on the west u system with a trunk 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:29.360
 common general and then then we get 

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.010
 specializes in master versoix the 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.900
 Post production is not 

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:34.610
 prescription age management 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.840
 production to all that is the budget 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:38.840
 all that is expensive and I 'm interested 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:42.050
 me after having a care also 

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:44.030
 everything that is editing rigging 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:44.450
 So that's all that is solid green 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:46.520
 etc. 

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:48.110
 that it interests me already more and then 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.700
 also everything that is programming so 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:51.890
 chalk programming software 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.090
 editing and seraphim for example or 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:54.620
 create new you doing a book 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.750
 created new after effect I do not know 

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:59.450
 so that's good to see it's at 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.330
 mature 1 3 years and then here I do not know 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.100
 if I was full I do not know at all 

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.560
 if I was full I hope that bastia 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.700
 a craze already to make this video 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.110
 next he do it at jitney everything 

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:10.760
 just because I think it's 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.590
 something that concerns us so I hope 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.820
 than to clarify certain things for them 

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:15.080
 people it's not necessarily for this 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:16.740
 year you can remember things 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:18.820
 for next year or 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.960
 why would you be schools 

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.040
 next year when you ask me 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.210
 to choose that will go very fast 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.310
 you have three months it will be very 

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:26.530
 very quickly so I hope I have caressed 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.620
 some things to see and rave about 

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:31.710
