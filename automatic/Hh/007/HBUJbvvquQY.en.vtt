00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.230

 That's what I said 

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:38.530
 simple and practical all very basic but 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.970
 better than taking the whole family as 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.160
 they do in India over a 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.170

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:56.050
 speedometer or steering wheel do not have 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:59.590
 assistance air conditioning or thinking 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:04.290
 but look without electric glass israel 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.290
 success there but it is optional that it is expensive 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.640
 knows where the motor of the year is and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:14.299

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:19.979
 six hundred and thirty cubic centimeters 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:21.750
 limb and why is it that tata 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.420

 taka was also designed by her not 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 will want stability in the hour of 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:40.530
 curves if you take great care 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.149
 the car is high being gravity is high and 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.649
 Like the driver back there 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.869
 you will find that here in front of the 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.329
