a<00:01:23.720> bad<00:01:23.900> thing<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.920> think<00:01:25.310> we<00:01:25.369> just<00:01:25.490> need<00:01:25.640> to<00:01:25.729> be

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
a bad thing I think we just need to be

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.940 
a bad thing I think we just need to be
aware<00:01:25.939> of<00:01:26.439> where<00:01:27.439> we're<00:01:27.590> getting<00:01:27.710> that

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
aware of where we're getting that

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:30.340 
aware of where we're getting that
validation<00:01:28.340> who<00:01:28.729> is<00:01:28.880> coming<00:01:29.210> from<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.630> what

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
validation who is coming from and what

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.700 
validation who is coming from and what
their<00:01:30.500> motivation<00:01:31.009> is<00:01:31.159> so<00:01:32.140> my<00:01:33.140> suggestion<00:01:33.590> to

their motivation is so my suggestion to

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.039 
their motivation is so my suggestion to
people<00:01:34.070> is<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.549> they<00:01:34.610> find<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.720> Flickr<00:01:35.930> group
