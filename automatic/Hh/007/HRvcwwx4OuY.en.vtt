00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
that having a cheap team might be good

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.060 
that having a cheap team might be good
because<00:00:30.960> they're<00:00:31.470> not<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.920> really

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
really well with it so I high suggest

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.910

you<00:02:42.600> check<00:02:42.810> it<00:02:42.990> out<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.230> again<00:02:43.530> most<00:02:43.740> of<00:02:43.830> these

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
you check it out and again most of these

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:45.949 
you check it out and again most of these
players<00:02:44.190> just<00:02:44.520> at<00:02:44.730> their<00:02:45.060> quick<00:02:45.270> sale<00:02:45.510> prices

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:02.550 
much of a difference but there is a

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:07.580 
much of a difference but there is a
slight<00:03:02.910> amount<00:03:04.190> that<00:03:05.190> I<00:03:06.020> suggest<00:03:07.020> buying<00:03:07.230> them

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
slight amount that I suggest buying them
