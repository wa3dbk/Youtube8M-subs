00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
something that maybe has an interesting

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.049 
something that maybe has an interesting
story<00:00:40.649> behind<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.460> just<00:00:41.670> looks<00:00:41.850> visually

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
interesting something like that the list

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.819 
interesting something like that the list
also<00:00:44.760> only<00:00:45.149> includes<00:00:45.690> error<00:00:45.960> cards<00:00:46.440> which<00:00:46.620> had

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
also only includes error cards which had

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.799 
also only includes error cards which had
corrected<00:00:47.370> versions<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.570> wasn't

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
corrected versions this wasn't

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:50.600 
corrected versions this wasn't
deliberate<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.710> was<00:00:49.920> just<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> went<00:00:50.550> to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
deliberate it was just when I went to

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
deliberate it was just when I went to
pick<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:51.000> out<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.480> more<00:00:51.690> interesting<00:00:52.289> ones

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
pick them out the more interesting ones

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.470 
pick them out the more interesting ones
seem<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> be<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.489> ones<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.850> were<00:00:53.879> corrected

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
seem to be the ones that were corrected

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.510 
seem to be the ones that were corrected
at<00:00:54.570> some<00:00:54.750> point<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.739> let's<00:00:56.010> get<00:00:56.160> off<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.430> the

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
at some point so let's get off of the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.670 
at some point so let's get off of the
list<00:00:56.640> coming<00:00:57.390> in<00:00:57.510> at<00:00:57.660> number<00:00:57.840> six<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.500> have<00:00:58.649> a

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
list coming in at number six we have a

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.189 
list coming in at number six we have a
hollow<00:00:58.980> vaporeon<00:00:59.789> from<00:01:00.000> jungle<00:01:00.270> printed

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
hollow vaporeon from jungle printed

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:03.380 
hollow vaporeon from jungle printed
without<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.680> jungle<00:01:02.039> symbol<00:01:02.399> now

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
without the jungle symbol now

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.119 
without the jungle symbol now
technically<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.260> placing<00:01:04.650> on<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:04.920> list

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
technically the placing on this list

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.130 
technically the placing on this list
should<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.400> for<00:01:05.700> all<00:01:05.939> hallows<00:01:06.299> jungle<00:01:06.780> cards

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
should be for all hallows jungle cards

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.020 
should be for all hallows jungle cards
because<00:01:07.350> there<00:01:07.799> was<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.920> print<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.549> all

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
because there was a print one where all

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.490 
because there was a print one where all
of<00:01:09.299> them<00:01:09.420> are<00:01:09.540> missing<00:01:09.810> the<00:01:09.869> jungle<00:01:10.170> symbol

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
of them are missing the jungle symbol

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.830 
of them are missing the jungle symbol
but<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.400> just<00:01:11.549> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.850> like<00:01:11.970> grape<00:01:12.180> aurion<00:01:12.570> so

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
but I just kind of like grape aurion so

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.590 
but I just kind of like grape aurion so
he's<00:01:13.619> getting<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.040> spot<00:01:14.280> this<00:01:15.030> one's<00:01:15.240> kind<00:01:15.509> of

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
he's getting the spot this one's kind of

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.969 
he's getting the spot this one's kind of
interesting<00:01:16.020> because<00:01:16.170> obviously<00:01:16.439> jungles

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
interesting because obviously jungles

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.219 
interesting because obviously jungles
came<00:01:17.189> out<00:01:17.340> right<00:01:17.610> after<00:01:17.670> base<00:01:18.119> set<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.659> it

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
came out right after base set and it

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.080 
came out right after base set and it
actually<00:01:19.380> makes<00:01:19.710> them<00:01:19.979> look<00:01:20.130> just<00:01:20.490> like<00:01:20.640> basic

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
actually makes them look just like basic

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.850 
actually makes them look just like basic
cards<00:01:21.390> because<00:01:21.570> base<00:01:21.930> set<00:01:22.200> obviously<00:01:22.590> didn't

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
cards because base set obviously didn't

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.800 
cards because base set obviously didn't
have<00:01:22.979> an<00:01:23.070> expansion<00:01:23.580> symbol<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.090> even<00:01:24.600> now<00:01:24.630> I

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
have an expansion symbol and even now I

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
have an expansion symbol and even now I
do<00:01:25.020> see<00:01:25.259> quite<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.530> lot<00:01:25.619> of<00:01:25.740> people<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.280> selling

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
do see quite a lot of people on selling

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.039 
do see quite a lot of people on selling

I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> first<00:02:14.520> one<00:02:14.760> to<00:02:14.790> school<00:02:15.060> it<00:02:15.120> was<00:02:15.300> a

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
I think the first one to school it was a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.810 
I think the first one to school it was a
mewtwo<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.050> then<00:02:16.320> since<00:02:16.620> then<00:02:16.860> some<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.730> the

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
mewtwo and then since then some of the

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.040 
mewtwo and then since then some of the
others<00:02:17.970> have<00:02:18.060> come<00:02:18.180> out<00:02:18.300> of<00:02:18.330> the<00:02:18.450> woodwork<00:02:18.780> and

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.050 
others have come out of the woodwork and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.260 
others have come out of the woodwork and
it's<00:02:19.860> believed<00:02:20.130> that<00:02:20.280> one<00:02:20.550> full<00:02:20.850> sheet<00:02:21.150> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
it's believed that one full sheet of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.910 
it's believed that one full sheet of
these<00:02:21.390> got<00:02:21.660> out<00:02:21.780> which<00:02:22.080> would<00:02:22.260> be<00:02:22.380> 30<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.860> each

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
these got out which would be 30 of each

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.560 
these got out which would be 30 of each
card<00:02:23.310> but<00:02:23.640> of<00:02:23.730> course<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.090> was<00:02:24.180> around<00:02:24.330> 15

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
card but of course that was around 15

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.080 
card but of course that was around 15
years<00:02:25.140> ago<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.680> significantly<00:02:26.550> fewer<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.970> them

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
years ago so significantly fewer of them

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.270

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
were like this and I feel about a

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.520 
were like this and I feel about a
hundred<00:02:32.640> dollars<00:02:33.120> for<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.450> and<00:02:33.600> I<00:02:34.260> thought<00:02:34.410> it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
hundred dollars for it and I thought it

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.830 
hundred dollars for it and I thought it
was<00:02:34.590> crazy<00:02:34.950> when<00:02:35.190> he<00:02:35.250> turned<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.610> down<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:36.570> a

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
was crazy when he turned it down but a

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.450 
was crazy when he turned it down but a
few<00:02:37.110> months<00:02:37.170> later<00:02:37.440> they<00:02:37.890> started<00:02:38.100> hitting

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
few months later they started hitting

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.160 
few months later they started hitting
ebay<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:39.030> we're<00:02:39.240> going<00:02:39.420> from<00:02:39.600> multiple

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
ebay and we're going from multiple

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.530 
ebay and we're going from multiple
hundreds<00:02:40.590> of<00:02:40.680> dollars<00:02:40.890> each<00:02:41.190> I<00:02:41.520> guess<00:02:42.300> it<00:02:42.420> was

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
hundreds of dollars each I guess it was

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.790 
hundreds of dollars each I guess it was
just<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.840> as<00:02:42.990> soon<00:02:43.110> as<00:02:43.230> people<00:02:43.350> found<00:02:43.680> out

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800

just that as soon as people found out
about<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.400> they<00:02:44.490> came<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.760> the<00:02:44.790> public

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
about them and they came to the public

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.150 
about them and they came to the public
eye<00:02:45.300> the<00:02:45.600> demand<00:02:45.990> was<00:02:46.140> there<00:02:46.410> so<00:02:46.650> they<00:02:46.890> start

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
eye the demand was there so they start

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.190 
eye the demand was there so they start
hitting<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.520> high<00:02:47.700> prices<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.390> now<00:02:48.990> we<00:02:49.050> move

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
hitting the high prices and now we move

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.840 
hitting the high prices and now we move
on<00:02:49.350> to<00:02:49.380> number<00:02:49.530> four<00:02:49.860> as<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.520> saw<00:02:50.640> with<00:02:50.730> the

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
on to number four as we saw with the

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.430

missed when the cards are printed but

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.730 
missed when the cards are printed but
obviously<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.570> set<00:02:54.870> symbol<00:02:55.230> being<00:02:55.380> missing
