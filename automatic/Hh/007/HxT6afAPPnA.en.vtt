00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
maybe not going to distance what do you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.880 
maybe not going to distance what do you
think<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.720> agree<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.170> the<00:00:40.350> money<00:00:40.530> doesn't

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890

fight<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.160> go<00:00:41.280> for<00:00:41.490> the<00:00:41.550> distance<00:00:41.970> and<00:00:42.240> I<00:00:42.360> don't

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
fight to go for the distance and I don't

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.090 
fight to go for the distance and I don't
fight<00:00:42.690> to<00:00:42.810> go<00:00:42.900> for<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.080> distance<00:00:43.470> so<00:00:43.650> we're

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
fight to go for the distance so we're

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.580 
fight to go for the distance so we're
both<00:00:44.190> knockout<00:00:44.640> fighters<00:00:45.180> so<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:46.380> guess<00:00:46.560> is

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
both knockout fighters so the guess is

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.020 
both knockout fighters so the guess is
the<00:00:47.010> bigger<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.310> good<00:00:47.430> money<00:00:47.610> would<00:00:47.790> be<00:00:47.910> on<00:00:47.940> a

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
the bigger the good money would be on a

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.770 
the bigger the good money would be on a
knockout

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
knockout

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.990

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
everybody and in a way it maybe gives

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.910

you<00:01:44.880> comfort<00:01:45.150> and<00:01:45.570> takes<00:01:46.290> away<00:01:46.409> some<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you comfort and takes away some of the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.770 
you comfort and takes away some of the
urgency<00:01:47.310> that<00:01:47.490> Pacquiao<00:01:47.940> is<00:01:48.120> all<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:48.450> that

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
urgency that Pacquiao is all that that

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.690

you're<00:01:48.990> set<00:01:49.290> for<00:01:49.500> life<00:01:49.770> now<00:01:50.010> and<00:01:50.190> I<00:01:50.250> think<00:01:50.310> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
you're set for life now and I think that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.740 
you're set for life now and I think that
that<00:01:50.909> could<00:01:51.120> betray<00:01:51.360> him

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that could betray him

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
that could betray him
that<00:01:51.930> sabotage<00:01:52.530> she's<00:01:52.710> always<00:01:52.950> been<00:01:53.250> maniacal

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
that sabotage she's always been maniacal

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.149 
that sabotage she's always been maniacal
though<00:01:54.240> in<00:01:54.479> his<00:01:54.780> preparation<00:01:55.200> what<00:01:55.799> makes<00:01:56.010> you

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
though in his preparation what makes you

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:57.710 
though in his preparation what makes you
think<00:01:56.340> he<00:01:56.520> won't<00:01:56.549> be<00:01:56.909> just<00:01:57.120> you<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.330> a<00:01:57.510> guy

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
think he won't be just you know a guy

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.020 
think he won't be just you know a guy
who's<00:01:57.870> really<00:01:58.080> good<00:01:58.350> in<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.500> gym<00:01:58.760> at<00:01:59.760> the<00:01:59.820> gym

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.120 
who's really good in the gym at the gym
he's<00:02:00.330> been<00:02:00.600> that<00:02:00.750> way<00:02:00.810> he<00:02:01.170> came<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.500> on<00:02:01.590> 238

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
he's been that way he came in on 238

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.830 
he's been that way he came in on 238
pounds<00:02:02.280> he<00:02:02.490> came<00:02:02.700> in<00:02:02.880> seven<00:02:03.180> pounds<00:02:03.479> lighter<00:02:03.720> I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
pounds he came in seven pounds lighter I

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.390 
pounds he came in seven pounds lighter I
know<00:02:03.900> it's<00:02:04.170> a<00:02:04.260> different<00:02:04.440> weight<00:02:04.650> class<00:02:04.860> but

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
know it's a different weight class but

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.010 
know it's a different weight class but
he<00:02:05.490> came<00:02:05.670> in<00:02:05.820> two<00:02:06.030> pounds<00:02:06.360> under<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.720> junior

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
he came in two pounds under the junior

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.389 
he came in two pounds under the junior
welterweight<00:02:07.170> he<00:02:07.470> could<00:02:07.650> have<00:02:07.740> been<00:02:07.860> 140

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
welterweight he could have been 140

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.400 
welterweight he could have been 140
maybe<00:02:09.000> he<00:02:09.209> overdid<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.840> little<00:02:09.869> bit

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
maybe he overdid it a little bit

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.080 
maybe he overdid it a little bit
look<00:02:10.830> I<00:02:10.950> don't<00:02:11.040> think<00:02:11.340> conditioning<00:02:11.910> will

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
look I don't think conditioning will

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.810 
look I don't think conditioning will
betray<00:02:12.450> him<00:02:12.570> right<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.260> 75%<00:02:13.920> of<00:02:14.310> this<00:02:14.430> game<00:02:14.670> is

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
betray him right but 75% of this game is

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:16.520 
betray him right but 75% of this game is
mental<00:02:15.150> all<00:02:15.390> right<00:02:15.570> that<00:02:15.840> could<00:02:16.049> betray<00:02:16.290> him<00:02:16.500> a

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
mental all right that could betray him a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.830 
mental all right that could betray him a
little<00:02:16.739> bit<00:02:16.860> also<00:02:17.580> he<00:02:17.820> had<00:02:17.970> such<00:02:18.209> a<00:02:18.239> walk<00:02:18.660> in

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
little bit also he had such a walk in

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.800 
little bit also he had such a walk in
the<00:02:18.959> park<00:02:18.989> with<00:02:19.920> De<00:02:20.070> La<00:02:20.250> Hoya<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.670> mean<00:02:21.180> it<00:02:21.390> was

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
the park with De La Hoya I mean it was

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.759 
the park with De La Hoya I mean it was
so<00:02:22.200> one-sided<00:02:23.030> he<00:02:24.030> was<00:02:24.480> not<00:02:25.080> in<00:02:25.320> any<00:02:25.620> way

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
so one-sided he was not in any way

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.550 
so one-sided he was not in any way
contested<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.880> fight<00:02:27.150> I<00:02:27.420> believe<00:02:28.350> at<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
contested in that fight I believe at the

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.370 
contested in that fight I believe at the
very<00:02:28.980> least<00:02:29.400> he's<00:02:30.180> gonna<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.510> truly<00:02:30.750> contested

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
very least he's gonna be truly contested

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.120 
very least he's gonna be truly contested
in<00:02:31.470> this<00:02:31.650> fight

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
in this fight

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.850 
in this fight
in<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.940> way<00:02:33.120> that<00:02:33.330> he<00:02:33.930> didn't<00:02:34.260> come<00:02:34.380> close<00:02:34.680> to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
in a way that he didn't come close to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.710 
in a way that he didn't come close to
being<00:02:35.040> in<00:02:35.459> that<00:02:35.670> fight<00:02:35.880> all<00:02:36.090> right<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.390> Hatton

being in that fight all right and Hatton

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.090 
being in that fight all right and Hatton

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
coming off again the one loss was

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.650 
coming off again the one loss was
