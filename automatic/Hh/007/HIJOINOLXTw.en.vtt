00:02:17.979 --> 00:02:17.989 
sized dot on the end and you want this

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:19.839 
sized dot on the end and you want this
bead<00:02:18.230> to<00:02:18.379> stick<00:02:18.620> so<00:02:18.829> put<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.040> reasonable<00:02:19.370> amount

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
bead to stick so put a reasonable amount

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:23.860 
bead to stick so put a reasonable amount
there<00:02:20.889> as<00:02:21.889> you<00:02:22.040> bring<00:02:22.189> your<00:02:22.249> bead<00:02:22.489> up<00:02:22.730> you<00:02:23.659> turn

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
there as you bring your bead up you turn

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.349 
there as you bring your bead up you turn
it<00:02:24.079> slightly<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.370> that<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.609> could<00:02:25.939> glucose

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:26.359 
it slightly so that it could glucose

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.179 
it slightly so that it could glucose
inside<00:02:26.900> the<00:02:27.109> dhole<00:02:28.900> turn<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:29.989> around<00:02:30.109> and<00:02:30.560> do

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:31.189 
inside the dhole turn it around and do

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.610 
inside the dhole turn it around and do
the<00:02:31.310> same<00:02:31.340> at<00:02:31.609> the<00:02:31.639> other<00:02:31.819> end<00:02:32.150> again<00:02:32.989> the<00:02:33.409> two

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
the same at the other end again the two

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.259 
the same at the other end again the two
end<00:02:33.889> ones<00:02:33.980> are<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.489> ones<00:02:34.669> that<00:02:34.760> you<00:02:34.939> want<00:02:35.150> to

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
end ones are the ones that you want to

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.240 
end ones are the ones that you want to
make<00:02:35.510> sure<00:02:35.540> it's<00:02:36.169> stuck<00:02:36.379> while<00:02:36.590> on<00:02:36.739> Tralee

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
make sure it's stuck while on Tralee

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.860 
make sure it's stuck while on Tralee
so<00:02:38.239> add<00:02:38.480> a<00:02:38.510> bit<00:02:38.719> of<00:02:38.749> glue<00:02:38.900> here<00:02:40.689> get<00:02:41.689> out

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
so add a bit of glue here get out

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.250 
so add a bit of glue here get out
turning<00:02:42.590> it<00:02:42.680> as<00:02:42.799> you<00:02:42.889> go<00:02:43.810> what<00:02:44.810> they<00:02:44.989> put<00:02:45.169> in

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
turning it as you go what they put in

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:49.910 
turning it as you go what they put in
well<00:02:45.409> until<00:02:45.709> this<00:02:45.829> step

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.699 

this<00:03:00.480> one<00:03:00.659> again<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:00.989> want<00:03:01.290> to<00:03:01.349> have<00:03:01.439> a<00:03:01.500> fair

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
this one again you want to have a fair

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.270 
this one again you want to have a fair
amount<00:03:01.829> of<00:03:02.069> glue<00:03:02.219> there<00:03:03.769> for<00:03:04.769> exactly<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
amount of glue there for exactly the

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.929 
amount of glue there for exactly the
same<00:03:05.340> reason<00:03:05.819> you<00:03:05.849> don't<00:03:06.060> want<00:03:06.269> those<00:03:06.420> to<00:03:06.480> move

two<00:03:19.439> these<00:03:20.040> are<00:03:20.099> made<00:03:20.459> up<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.970> a<00:03:21.299> large<00:03:21.689> bead

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
two these are made up of a large bead

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.520 
two these are made up of a large bead
for<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:22.319> head<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:23.760> neck<00:03:24.000> area<00:03:24.209> and<00:03:25.140> smaller

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
for the head the neck area and smaller

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.479 
for the head the neck area and smaller
bead<00:03:25.849> for<00:03:26.849> the<00:03:26.909> start<00:03:27.209> of<00:03:27.359> the<00:03:27.450> body<00:03:28.489> wrapping

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:29.489 
bead for the start of the body wrapping

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:31.640 
bead for the start of the body wrapping
for<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.879> body<00:03:30.090> and<00:03:30.510> allowed<00:03:31.109> to<00:03:31.260> bead<00:03:31.439> at<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
for the body and allowed to bead at the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
for the body and allowed to bead at the
end<00:03:33.109> now<00:03:34.109> the<00:03:34.170> wrapping<00:03:34.590> for<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.859> body<00:03:35.069> is

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
end now the wrapping for the body is

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.500 
end now the wrapping for the body is
measured<00:03:37.519> from<00:03:38.519> a<00:03:38.639> sheet<00:03:38.849> of<00:03:38.879> paper<00:03:39.150> just

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
measured from a sheet of paper just

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:47.559 
measured from a sheet of paper just
plain<00:03:40.409> ordinary<00:03:40.680> paper<00:03:41.579> that<00:03:41.849> you<00:03:42.000> print<00:03:42.269> from

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:50.240 

remeasure<00:03:48.569> between<00:03:48.930> your<00:03:49.049> bead<00:03:49.319> and<00:03:49.590> where

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
remeasure between your bead and where

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:52.399 
remeasure between your bead and where
you<00:03:50.370> want<00:03:50.549> it<00:03:50.669> to<00:03:50.790> be<00:03:50.939> in<00:03:51.209> this<00:03:51.780> case<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.260> get

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
you want it to be in this case I get

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:54.649 
you want it to be in this case I get
five<00:03:52.650> centimeters<00:03:53.400> I'm<00:03:53.879> thinking<00:03:54.389> I<00:03:54.480> should

00:03:54.649 --> 00:03:54.659 
five centimeters I'm thinking I should

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:56.509 
five centimeters I'm thinking I should
have<00:03:54.750> gone<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:55.019> five<00:03:55.139> and<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.409> half<00:03:55.439> but<00:03:55.950> there's

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
have gone to five and a half but there's

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:59.569 
have gone to five and a half but there's
some<00:03:56.669> choice<00:03:57.500> using<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> sheet<00:03:58.769> of<00:03:58.889> papers<00:03:59.340> I

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
some choice using a sheet of papers I

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.369 
some choice using a sheet of papers I
cut<00:04:00.060> off<00:04:00.209> a<00:04:00.299> strip<00:04:00.359> which<00:04:00.750> is<00:04:00.870> five<00:04:01.109> and<00:04:01.319> a<00:04:01.349> half

cut off a strip which is five and a half

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:05.600 
cut off a strip which is five and a half
centimeters<00:04:01.919> one

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.610 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:11.060 

picked<00:04:06.060> up<00:04:06.210> one<00:04:06.360> of<00:04:06.390> my<00:04:06.570> skewers<00:04:09.920> added<00:04:10.920> a<00:04:10.980> bit

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070 
picked up one of my skewers added a bit

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:45.670

of<00:04:11.130> glue

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:59.469 

using<00:04:46.680> you<00:04:46.770> clue

00:04:59.469 --> 00:04:59.479 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:07.300 

somebody's<00:05:00.349> either

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:07.310 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:24.580

last<00:05:25.590> but<00:05:25.830> not<00:05:25.860> least<00:05:26.250> are<00:05:27.150> the<00:05:27.210> widow<00:05:27.450> problem

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
last but not least are the widow problem

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:31.160 
last but not least are the widow problem
these<00:05:28.230> are<00:05:28.290> probably<00:05:28.800> the<00:05:28.890> easiest<00:05:29.040> move<00:05:30.170> is

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
these are probably the easiest move is

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.920 
these are probably the easiest move is
that<00:05:31.230> with<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.160> length<00:05:32.400> of<00:05:32.610> down<00:05:32.850> I<00:05:33.180> bought<00:05:33.900> a

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:33.930 
that with the length of down I bought a

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:36.890 
that with the length of down I bought a
1.2<00:05:34.650> meter<00:05:35.130> length<00:05:35.700> of<00:05:35.880> down<00:05:36.090> from<00:05:36.300> the<00:05:36.450> local

00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:43.520 
hardware store it costs me a dollar 50
I've<00:05:40.230> popped<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.800> using<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.310> hacksaw<00:05:42.530> using

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
I've popped that using the hacksaw using

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.470 
I've popped that using the hacksaw using
the<00:05:43.620> hacksaw<00:05:44.010> I've<00:05:44.220> cut<00:05:44.730> that<00:05:44.910> into<00:05:45.180> 11

00:05:45.470 --> 00:05:45.480 
the hacksaw I've cut that into 11

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.310 
the hacksaw I've cut that into 11
centimeter<00:05:46.080> lengths<00:05:47.510> I'm<00:05:48.510> then<00:05:48.840> taking<00:05:49.290> my

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:49.320 
centimeter lengths I'm then taking my

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:57.010 
centimeter lengths I'm then taking my
bladed<00:05:50.100> knife<00:05:53.390> scored<00:05:54.390> at<00:05:54.630> the<00:05:54.660> end<00:05:54.960> here

00:05:57.010 --> 00:05:57.020 
bladed knife scored at the end here

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.780 
bladed knife scored at the end here
mounted<00:05:58.020> all<00:05:58.110> the<00:05:58.200> way<00:05:58.320> around<00:05:58.590> and<00:05:58.830> then<00:05:59.490> cut

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
mounted all the way around and then cut

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:05.360 
mounted all the way around and then cut
inside<00:06:03.470> to<00:06:04.470> make<00:06:04.620> the<00:06:04.650> groove<00:06:04.980> that<00:06:05.010> you<00:06:05.220> can

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
inside to make the groove that you can

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.270 
inside to make the groove that you can
see<00:06:05.520> here

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:09.280 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:12.360 

then<00:06:10.000> again<00:06:10.420> using<00:06:10.930> the<00:06:11.020> bladed<00:06:11.350> knife<00:06:11.380> I<00:06:11.830> cut

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
then again using the bladed knife I cut

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.390 
then again using the bladed knife I cut
it<00:06:12.520> down<00:06:12.730> and<00:06:13.030> scored<00:06:13.780> around<00:06:15.300> and<00:06:16.300> again<00:06:16.570> here

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
it down and scored around and again here

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.990 
it down and scored around and again here
and<00:06:18.870> then<00:06:19.870> came<00:06:20.110> the<00:06:20.230> easy<00:06:20.440> part<00:06:20.830> I<00:06:21.130> got<00:06:21.700> to<00:06:21.850> the

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.000 
and then came the easy part I got to the

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.840 
and then came the easy part I got to the
bladed<00:06:22.600> knife<00:06:22.630> at<00:06:23.020> an<00:06:23.169> angle<00:06:23.560> and<00:06:23.770> I<00:06:24.370> could<00:06:24.639> cut

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
bladed knife at an angle and I could cut

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:34.350 
bladed knife at an angle and I could cut
like<00:06:25.660> this<00:06:28.470> turned<00:06:29.470> it<00:06:29.590> around<00:06:33.060> you<00:06:34.060> kept<00:06:34.240> from

00:06:34.350 --> 00:06:34.360 
like this turned it around you kept from

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:40.440 
like this turned it around you kept from
the<00:06:34.510> other<00:06:34.690> end<00:06:37.380> it's<00:06:38.380> not<00:06:38.650> pretty<00:06:38.950> but<00:06:39.450> your

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:40.450 
the other end it's not pretty but your

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:42.540 
the other end it's not pretty but your
threads<00:06:40.660> covering<00:06:40.990> that<00:06:41.080> anyway<00:06:41.470> and<00:06:41.830> if<00:06:42.460> you

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:42.550 
threads covering that anyway and if you

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.530 
threads covering that anyway and if you
wanted<00:06:42.820> to<00:06:42.940> you<00:06:43.060> could<00:06:43.150> run<00:06:43.270> a<00:06:43.300> bit<00:06:43.450> of

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:43.540 
wanted to you could run a bit of

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:45.150 
wanted to you could run a bit of
sandpaper<00:06:43.780> over<00:06:44.320> that<00:06:44.470> to<00:06:44.620> smooth<00:06:44.890> it<00:06:45.010> out<00:06:45.100> a

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:45.160 
sandpaper over that to smooth it out a

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:48.750 
sandpaper over that to smooth it out a
bit<00:06:45.250> more<00:06:45.750> quick<00:06:46.750> easy<00:06:47.169> cheap<00:06:48.100> ways<00:06:48.460> of

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:48.760 
bit more quick easy cheap ways of

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.320 
bit more quick easy cheap ways of
getting<00:06:48.970> some<00:06:49.150> buttons<00:06:49.480> I<00:06:51.060> probably<00:06:52.060> would

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
getting some buttons I probably would

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:53.760 
getting some buttons I probably would
add<00:06:52.510> spangles<00:06:52.960> to<00:06:53.050> these<00:06:53.200> particular<00:06:53.680> ones

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770 
add spangles to these particular ones

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.430 
add spangles to these particular ones
because<00:06:54.190> it<00:06:54.310> down<00:06:54.460> is<00:06:54.580> extremely<00:06:55.150> lightweight

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:55.440 
because it down is extremely lightweight

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.320 
because it down is extremely lightweight
where<00:06:56.440> is<00:06:56.620> the<00:06:56.740> bees<00:06:56.950> added<00:06:57.400> some<00:06:57.550> weight<00:06:57.730> to

00:06:58.320 --> 00:06:58.330 
where is the bees added some weight to

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:00.810 
where is the bees added some weight to
the<00:06:58.419> skewers
