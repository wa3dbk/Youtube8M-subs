00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.750
 hello everybody here is a relative and today 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.110
 I bring you a koff gameplay of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:16.590
 yuri mora humor for 31 team deathmatch 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.660
 on the face map and I took advantage of 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.039
 gameplay is because I went well for the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 least from my point of view I did well 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.850
 Why to get a good game play? 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
 It's a little difficult, I'm not one. 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.550
 pro player is on the contrary 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.560
 so I'll enjoy gameplay is 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.600
 talking a little bit is up to you, right? 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.640
 the first thing the next personal you 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.710
 Do you want to play and w3? 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 Just do not have a game bought. 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.850
 problem to extinct releasing is by that 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
 weekend 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.399
 The game is then go down there and get 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.350
 Have fun, and then you can take your 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.180
 conclusions about the game if you see 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.270
 it's worth you can buy 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.649
 ' No, you do not buy it, then I 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.140
 I wanted to talk a little bit about it because 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.730
 this game here I think it was up to a 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.309
 good example of this 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.990
 Why are you so cold and hot, huh? 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.840
 as soon as steam gives the name when they 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.520
 place a game released by the end of 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.369
 cold weekend weekend 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.100
 so a lot of people are coming to play 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.080
 or in the case make a test right 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.520
 or at least have fun only for those 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.159
 two days actually 3 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.619
 only some people who have no concept 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.930
 of the game then in a little while 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.790
 ask the person how to play flash is 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.790
 Of course it will roll that basic or 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.079
 has no way of 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.189
 so we have to stop and think 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.720
 also ne 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.700
 we can not get too heavy with 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.950
 the guy is right because cuz people have to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.630
 also sees as extinct releasing much of the 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.250
 people are coming to play and w3 by 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.100
 first time 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.970
 that's why this is it and it is and it went well 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.920
 It's funny how not to be funny. 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:57.780
 from here to a little bit there and some 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.579
 people there by the company the attention that 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.990
 in a little while there's going to be a hoax, right? 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.090
 things like 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.990
 It's good to talk a little bit about my weapon. 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.970
 km 4 I really like m4 nÃ© 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.680
 even more on this map that is Baccara 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:15.629
 many people use snippers right here 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.370
 field is something that leaves me very 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.920
 annoying is not the fact that you use 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.730
 snipper does not instead have times that 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.810
 I even use it, but the fact that you stay 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.099
 playing with her is something that 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.829
 It leaves me very angry but I do not prefer 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:34.019
 use a month in full here why to use 

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.540
 a long-range riff that in the m4 case 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.659
 I've used pretty much got it 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:41.459
 catch the golden camouflage 

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:44.549
 I only have three weapons with 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.109
 golden carriage in the case m 4 pp 90 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.599
 and only 90 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.239
 is an area that I'm almost getting the 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:53.790
 golden campaign is right spaces 12 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:56.549
 I like most is using for 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.169
 example maps such as me and from time to time 

00:02:56.549 --> 00:03:01.469
 when in hard challenge 

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:03.750
 I use it, there's no space, I do not know. 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:05.459
 Because these days she's leaving me. 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.829
 to be desired do not know if my friend who 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:12.719
 Is it bad or really spas and there? 

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:15.000
 means gayzinho not even know if ney will 

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:16.680
 Because in those days there happened 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.720
 some updates, right? 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.010
 I do not know if they snow for some 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.739
 weapons 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.840
 the result is one researched in that right? 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.049
 so this is personal these are the four 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:31.109
 weapons you like most using an m 4 

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:34.919
 pp 90 p 90 and spas 

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:39.569
 many people asked me then already 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:41.790
 I answer the other question, I do not know either. 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:44.280
 if you realized now it's a failure 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.989
 my an addiction and I think I 'm not the 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.879
 only one who have this addiction is the following 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.819
 You just killed an enemy you. 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:53.159
 Reload this, this is something that is 

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:56.310
 fails most of the time because you 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:58.859
 happened I was using the mp9 I 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.599
 I killed an enemy and I could very well 

00:03:58.859 --> 00:04:03.180
 using the remaining bullets is 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:04.919
 killing the other and I did not go to carry 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.519
 and I recharged him and went there 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:07.079
 killed 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.139
 so I think it's something that people 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:11.669
 You have to stop right truth we do not 

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.870
 You may be using the way 

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:14.459
 which was but I think I have to 

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:18.090
 stop it because it really 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:20.009
 It messes up a lot, because there are hours. 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.509
 that you will lose a freight or will 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.310
 end up dying will be losing by 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.690
 example of the oab because of this failure 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.060
 of this vice, right? 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.520
 and a thing also moab personal never 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.080
 I caught the habit people think I 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.090
 I already got it because we see talking gameplay. 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.220
 Wow, he plays a lot of not personal 

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:38.190
 I told you to get the gameplay of 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:41.430
 mw3 for me it's hard to talk right I 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.920
 It's true, I'm not good at 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:47.040
 otherwise I'm a normal player knows 

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:49.490
 generally been a good match and in the middle 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:52.170
 this time for a normal match only 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.120
 I kill two hills and so it goes 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.070
 and this game here I think I did 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.950
 3/0 from start I was even thinking 

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:02.460
 Wow, this time, and not right? 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:06.390
 the match also sang Gerona on hard 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:10.230
 reset with my pp 90 and I got to 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:13.020
 do 17 ba 01 then know how it starts to climb 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:16.320
 that tension, only God is now and goes there and 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:18.690
 You end up dying for a guy, right? 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:21.000
 and when it happens when you die 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:22.470
 It's for a champion or for one here. 

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.780
 these things of the kind you should 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:26.250
 to be very pissed I got pissed because 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.430
 When I die in this match but still 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.560
 17 bazaar went to a champion and I stayed 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.220
 very angry and still finished the match 

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:39.240
 I made a map of the book or ne 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.740
 I managed to kill these two guys there and 

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:43.350
 I also hope you guys have enjoyed it 

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:45.450
