00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 and rio depending on the amount of memory he 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.740
 will cost from 32 to 47 thousand rubles 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:11.190
 Apple has announced a date today 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.469
 It launches in the US this September 19 for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.470
 apple rush was observed by anastasia 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.029
 Grishchenko 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.550
 stir in the streets of new york around 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.439
 new apple started looking for two weeks 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.470
 prior to sales armed 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.279
 folding chairs sleeping bags 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:29.150
 tourist tents 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:32.369
 Apple fans are on duty at the company's office 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.649
 24 hours a day take a shower in 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.530
 gym near new york by the way 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:40.800
 Now 30 degrees of heat such victims 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.100
 for the sake of iphone 6 because he has the most 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.370
 the big screen in the history of apple apple 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.410
 and 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.059
 from nikulin family i think we will see 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.559
 a huge number of people who 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.690
 will switch to a new iphone 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.550
 because apple users have long been 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.039
 stare he friends who 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.870
 android with a bigger screen they 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.239
 wanted the same so i think we 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.579
 see real sales growth and I think 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.610
 apple grab your share of androids 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.400
 due to the appearance of iPhone 6 thinner lighter 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.189
 faster newer operating system more 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.619
 powerful processor improved camera capacious 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.840
 phone battery can be used 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.270
 like a travel card a bank card and 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.759
 identity card everything works on 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.189
 distance for apple fans 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.619
 credit card and wallet usage 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.000
 now the last century especially 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.040
 I wonder what apple added 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.200
 several new options that made it 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.360
 fee for consumers is safer easier 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.220
 for example to transfer money you need 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 just use a fingerprint that 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.079
 It seems to me very much 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.909
 users 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.610
 and your data is not coming 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:50.189
 sellers is a new security code 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:52.590
 designed for each operation we 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.079
 love to create great products that 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.240
 make people's lives richer we love 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.210
 create technologies that become 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.189
 personal personal allow you to do 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.860
 what was previously impossible to imagine 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:07.590
 we worked long and hard to 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.479
 create a completely new product we believe 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.210
 he will change the way people think about 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.490
 similar in 

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.710
 three things i'm extremely happy and very 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.120
 proud to share it with 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:21.040
 you are truly a new chapter 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.170
 but this in Silicon Valley is not 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.510
 confined it led to the public 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.670
 smart apple watch with wireless 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.860
 charging them built a few 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.650
 sensors that record indicators 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.960
 human health for example heart rhythm 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.570
 quality sleep steps and many others 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.390
 parameters of the application for running helps 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.930
 count calories burned 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.250
 what character 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.710
 tech products always 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:46.750
 developed crazy techno phil and people 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.340
 that look like bill gates or mark 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.320
 zuckerberg and here it is something 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.360
 completely different same technique in 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.520
 combined with luxury we never 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.500
 have seen technical products are made of 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.720
 fine leather and gold is something new 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.730
 new product category i think is 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.830
 will be grand i think it will lead 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.710
 completely new type of customer 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.320
 but perhaps the biggest trump apple 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:10.600
 became legendary youtube during 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.030
 presentations of the six gonna and the company 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:13.330

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.120

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.120
 the album is already free at all 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.000
 Apple devices are the most massive release in 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.400
 the stories besides the bonus stated that the songs 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.470
 innocence is a very personal album about 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.800
 relationships not only within the group 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.710
 but also in the families of musicians the sensation hall 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:34.480
 applauded standing one of the few 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.390
 apple presentations when company stocks 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.770
 rose 100 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:39.470
 quickly right after graduation 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:42.140
 representations they jumped on almost 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:45.370
 three and a half percent anastasia 

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.370
