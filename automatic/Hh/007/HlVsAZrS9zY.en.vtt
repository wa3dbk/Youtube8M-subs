00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.589 
crashing reasons on the 360 in
particular<00:02:08.160> right<00:02:08.489> now<00:02:08.700> you<00:02:09.179> know<00:02:09.270> I've<00:02:09.390> seen

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.210 
particular right now you know I've seen
multiple<00:02:09.989> with<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.289> sponsored<00:02:10.679> there's<00:02:11.039> quite

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
multiple with a sponsored there's quite

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.589 
multiple with a sponsored there's quite
a<00:02:11.250> few<00:02:11.280> reasons<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.819> crashing<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.330> course

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:12.599 
a few reasons for crashing of course

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.030 
a few reasons for crashing of course
they<00:02:12.750> will<00:02:12.870> have<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.110> be<00:02:13.170> big<00:02:13.379> in<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.739> dish

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
they will have to be big in the dish

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.100 
they will have to be big in the dish
to<00:02:14.129> just<00:02:14.310> crashing<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.879> 360<00:02:15.510> versions<00:02:15.900> been

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
to just crashing the 360 versions been

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.390 
to just crashing the 360 versions been
seeing<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.349> lot<00:02:16.379> of<00:02:16.530> framerate<00:02:16.829> drops<00:02:17.219> a

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
seeing a lot of framerate drops a

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.130 
seeing a lot of framerate drops a
particular<00:02:17.700> older<00:02:18.180> world<00:02:18.420> so<00:02:18.750> that's<00:02:18.989> a

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
particular older world so that's a

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:20.809 
particular older world so that's a
serious<00:02:19.560> issue<00:02:19.680> in<00:02:19.980> addition<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.519> that

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
serious issue in addition to that

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.550 
serious issue in addition to that
there's<00:02:21.060> quite<00:02:21.269> a<00:02:21.299> few<00:02:21.390> spawning<00:02:21.840> issues<00:02:22.230> bats

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
there's quite a few spawning issues bats

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.140 
there's quite a few spawning issues bats
aren't<00:02:22.859> spawning<00:02:23.189> on<00:02:23.370> older<00:02:23.700> worlds<00:02:24.000> right

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
aren't spawning on older worlds right

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.940 
aren't spawning on older worlds right
now<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.540> that's<00:02:24.719> going<00:02:24.870> to<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:24.989> fixed<00:02:25.349> also<00:02:25.530> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
now so that's going to be fixed also a

which is hot and even anywhere in the
world<00:02:32.819> so<00:02:33.090> they're<00:02:33.209> basically<00:02:33.299> not<00:02:33.840> in<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:34.079 
world so they're basically not in the

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:35.300 
world so they're basically not in the
game<00:02:34.260> because<00:02:34.560> you<00:02:34.650> know<00:02:34.769> they'd<00:02:34.920> won't<00:02:35.099> spawn

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
game because you know they'd won't spawn

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.699 
game because you know they'd won't spawn
properly<00:02:35.700> horses<00:02:36.629> are<00:02:36.840> actually<00:02:37.200> d<00:02:37.409> spawning

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
properly horses are actually d spawning

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.289 
properly horses are actually d spawning
when<00:02:38.040> you<00:02:38.129> tie<00:02:38.310> them<00:02:38.459> to<00:02:38.579> a<00:02:38.640> fence<00:02:38.909> so<00:02:39.150> that's

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299 
when you tie them to a fence so that's

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:40.610 
when you tie them to a fence so that's
going<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> be<00:02:39.569> fixed<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.019> there<00:02:40.260> is<00:02:40.349> also<00:02:40.439> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
going to be fixed and there is also a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.500 
going to be fixed and there is also a
whole<00:02:40.889> range<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.459> other<00:02:41.609> issues<00:02:41.790> which<00:02:42.269> lots

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
whole range of other issues which lots

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.849 
whole range of other issues which lots
people<00:02:42.780> been<00:02:42.900> having<00:02:43.230> which<00:02:43.379> are<00:02:43.530> all<00:02:43.650> going

now<00:02:52.829> with<00:02:53.010> sony<00:02:53.280> so<00:02:53.639> dead<00:02:53.849> literally<00:02:54.180> just

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
now with sony so dead literally just

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.849

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:57.440 
have nothing to do but fix bugs I
imagine<00:02:56.519> they'll<00:02:56.700> probably<00:02:56.939> try<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.329> push

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
imagine they'll probably try and push

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.240 
imagine they'll probably try and push
the<00:02:57.569> update<00:02:57.810> out<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.439> before<00:02:58.590> they<00:02:58.919> go<00:02:59.069> for

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
the update out just before they go for

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.890 
the update out just before they go for
Christmas<00:02:59.549> break<00:02:59.700> which<00:03:00.180> will<00:03:00.480> probably<00:03:00.750> be

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
Christmas break which will probably be

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.110 
Christmas break which will probably be
like<00:03:01.530> some<00:03:01.829> point<00:03:02.129> I<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.370> know<00:03:02.519> early<00:03:02.939> next

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120
