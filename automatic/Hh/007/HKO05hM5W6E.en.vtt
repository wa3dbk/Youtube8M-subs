this<00:00:05.700> is<00:00:05.879> the<00:00:06.000> flying<00:00:06.270> pegasus<00:00:07.220> flight

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
this is the flying pegasus flight

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.959 
this is the flying pegasus flight
sequence<00:00:08.610> part<00:00:09.120> two<00:00:09.559> so<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.980> a<00:00:11.010> bit<00:00:11.820> of<00:00:11.910> a

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
sequence part two so this is a bit of a

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.570 
sequence part two so this is a bit of a
longer<00:00:12.210> sequence<00:00:12.809> and<00:00:13.170> it's<00:00:14.009> broken<00:00:14.309> by<00:00:14.549> a

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
longer sequence and it's broken by a

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.750 
longer sequence and it's broken by a
checkpoint<00:00:15.139> because<00:00:16.139> there's<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.609> kind<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> a

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
checkpoint because there's a kind of a

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.490 
checkpoint because there's a kind of a
little<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> little<00:00:18.449> boss<00:00:18.900> battle<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:19.410> the

said<00:04:20.250> that<00:04:20.400> my<00:04:20.579> first<00:04:20.789> video<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.180> think

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.500 

so<00:04:24.350> I<00:04:24.890> really<00:04:25.550> like<00:04:25.700> that<00:04:25.850> animation<00:04:26.360> where

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
so I really like that animation where

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.550 
so I really like that animation where
he's<00:04:26.630> jumping<00:04:27.380> back<00:04:27.560> on<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.950> his<00:04:28.070> horse<00:04:29.560> okay

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:30.560 
he's jumping back on to his horse okay

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.750 
he's jumping back on to his horse okay

another battle here and you have the

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:52.180 
another battle here and you have the
checkpoint<00:04:49.820> and<00:04:50.200> at<00:04:51.200> first<00:04:51.710> you're<00:04:51.950> just

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
checkpoint and at first you're just

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.830 
checkpoint and at first you're just
you're<00:04:52.670> hitting<00:04:52.970> him<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.330> dodging<00:04:53.720> his

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:53.840 
you're hitting him and dodging his

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:55.210 
you're hitting him and dodging his
attacks<00:04:54.200> he's<00:04:54.620> gonna<00:04:54.710> be<00:04:54.830> doing<00:04:55.070> those

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
attacks he's gonna be doing those

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.430 
attacks he's gonna be doing those
horizontal<00:04:55.820> attacks<00:04:56.330> from<00:04:56.600> left<00:04:57.020> to<00:04:57.080> right<00:04:57.290> or

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:57.440 
horizontal attacks from left to right or

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.710 
horizontal attacks from left to right or
right<00:04:57.470> to<00:04:57.620> left<00:04:57.770> and<00:05:00.040> that's<00:05:01.040> gonna<00:05:01.160> be<00:05:01.340> a

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
right to left and that's gonna be a

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.510 
right to left and that's gonna be a
dodging<00:05:02.720> sequence<00:05:03.080> after<00:05:03.440> this<00:05:03.590> and<00:05:03.860> I<00:05:04.310> think

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
dodging sequence after this and I think

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:05.860 
dodging sequence after this and I think
you<00:05:04.580> get<00:05:04.760> about<00:05:04.940> four<00:05:05.270> hits<00:05:05.480> and<00:05:05.600> then<00:05:05.750> you're

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
you get about four hits and then you're

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.530 
you get about four hits and then you're
dead<00:05:06.020> on<00:05:06.050> this<00:05:06.320> difficulty<00:05:07.130> mode<00:05:07.340> but<00:05:08.300> just

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
dead on this difficulty mode but just

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:09.910 
dead on this difficulty mode but just
bear<00:05:08.720> in<00:05:08.780> mind<00:05:08.900> that<00:05:08.990> however<00:05:09.290> much<00:05:09.530> damage

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:09.920 
bear in mind that however much damage

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:12.250 
bear in mind that however much damage
you're<00:05:10.070> dealing<00:05:10.340> your<00:05:10.880> delts<00:05:11.450> here<00:05:11.750> but<00:05:12.050> that

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
you're dealing your delts here but that

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.930 
you're dealing your delts here but that
is<00:05:12.500> just<00:05:12.680> gonna<00:05:12.770> carry<00:05:13.070> over<00:05:13.130> to<00:05:13.310> the<00:05:13.430> this

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
is just gonna carry over to the this

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:17.320 
is just gonna carry over to the this
little<00:05:14.210> sequence<00:05:14.450> here<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:15.700> the<00:05:16.700> pattern<00:05:17.090> is

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
little sequence here so the pattern is

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.000 
little sequence here so the pattern is
at<00:05:17.510> the<00:05:17.630> same<00:05:17.840> every<00:05:18.050> time<00:05:18.080> I<00:05:18.260> found<00:05:18.800> not

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
at the same every time I found not

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:21.910 
at the same every time I found not
mistaken<00:05:19.460> you<00:05:19.760> go<00:05:19.880> left<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.600> go<00:05:20.960> down<00:05:21.410> you<00:05:21.800> go

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:21.920 
mistaken you go left you go down you go

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.040 
mistaken you go left you go down you go
right<00:05:22.250> you<00:05:22.280> go<00:05:22.610> up<00:05:22.970> and<00:05:23.270> then<00:05:23.420> good<00:05:23.630> then<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
right you go up and then good then the

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:26.520 
right you go up and then good then the
final<00:05:24.410> one<00:05:24.530> is<00:05:24.560> left<00:05:24.860> again<00:05:25.190> so<00:05:25.400> it's<00:05:25.640> like

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
final one is left again so it's like

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.170 
final one is left again so it's like
from<00:05:27.530> 9<00:05:27.770> o'clock<00:05:27.890> position<00:05:28.490> all<00:05:28.790> the<00:05:28.850> way<00:05:28.970> back

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
from 9 o'clock position all the way back

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.370 
from 9 o'clock position all the way back
to<00:05:29.390> back<00:05:30.230> to<00:05:30.350> the<00:05:30.380> start<00:05:30.710> so<00:05:31.070> I<00:05:31.970> gotta<00:05:32.960> tell<00:05:33.230> I

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:33.380 
to back to the start so I gotta tell I

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.300 
to back to the start so I gotta tell I
got<00:05:33.500> hit<00:05:33.680> I<00:05:33.710> think<00:05:34.610> one<00:05:34.820> time<00:05:34.850> I<00:05:36.130> know<00:05:37.130> it's

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
got hit I think one time I know it's

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.390 
got hit I think one time I know it's
kind<00:05:37.460> of<00:05:37.490> a<00:05:37.610> bullshit<00:05:38.650> getting<00:05:39.650> hit<00:05:39.800> but<00:05:39.980> that

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:52.100 
button presses I think maybe two quick

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:55.720 
button presses I think maybe two quick
time<00:05:52.310> button<00:05:52.550> presses<00:05:52.940> here<00:05:54.190> and<00:05:55.190> then<00:05:55.640> we're

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:55.730 
time button presses here and then we're

00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:58.150 
time button presses here and then we're
gonna<00:05:55.820> slay<00:05:56.120> this<00:05:56.300> guy<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.840> then<00:05:57.380> in<00:05:57.800> the
