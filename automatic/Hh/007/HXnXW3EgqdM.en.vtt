we got from the coro coro scans a couple
of<00:00:26.439> days<00:00:26.589> ago<00:00:27.089> so<00:00:28.089> I<00:00:28.119> guess<00:00:28.210> you<00:00:28.359> could<00:00:28.480> say

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:28.570 
of days ago so I guess you could say

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.029 
of days ago so I guess you could say
maybe<00:00:28.779> it's<00:00:28.929> not<00:00:29.019> there's<00:00:29.230> nothing<00:00:29.560> new<00:00:29.740> but
