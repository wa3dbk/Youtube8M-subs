00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:07.680
 hello friends today we are going to make a garden 

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:12.589
 vertical for it we are going to use these 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.589
 bottles 5 bottles there are 

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.439
 and in them 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.650
 let's put a bonus and then 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.990
 we will sow 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:27.619
 these garlic 

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.860
 these eyes are purple garlic to see here 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:33.760
 is purple garlic bought in nursery and 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:37.910
 they are the best for planting you can use 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.420
 normal garlic from fruit shop but 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.920
 make sure they germinate because some 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.690
 of them manipulate them so that they do not 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.840
 germinate 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:51.800
 these I am absolutely sure that 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:54.940
 will finish then look then I will 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.940
 explain what about the bottles 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:59.850
 these last two 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.920
 here 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 are the irrigation mechanism according 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.140
 and you're here 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.330
 are going to be the orchard itself will be 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:18.780
 with fertilizer and here we will pose the garlic 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.530
 It is important to tell you that all 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.330
 bottles we have cut the bottom 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.400
 none of the five has it for it 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.410
 we use a cutter and scissors 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.410
 and you're also cut 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.260
 besides, you see quite a lot more 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:37.720
 difference 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:41.110
 we focus on these 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.450
 the first to think that they will always go 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.340
 All five bottles will go 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.820
 all upside down when the 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.260
 orchard all going to go a mouth down and go 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.350
 to go 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:55.150
 the first the closest to the ground the 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.780
 bottle 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:01.120
 that has a stopper but does not have a woman 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.310
 a plug without a hole, what does 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:07.360
 holes is in the bottle we have 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:12.960
 put four holes look here one 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.960
 two and three and four holes 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.860
 then the bottle sees that it has no stopper 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.840
 the bottle does that either and if 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.150
 you want to make a bigger garden 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.150
 higher with the bottles you can add 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:32.629
 here the bottles that you want 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.569
 then this bottle that is the 

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:37.450
 irrigation system 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:40.989
 what is this little girl about 20 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:43.439
 centimeters that has a stopper with a 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.269
 woman and that little black dot 

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:49.260
 It is a tiny hole so that it falls 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:53.010
 water drop by drop 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:57.079
 and this slightly larger bottle is going to 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.079
 be the water tank 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.730
 look 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.480
 I have already put the fertilizer of the bottles 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:08.870
 look I left a little bit without putting a 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.870
 thing like that 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:15.569
 so that between the mouth of the next 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.300
 here in this space 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:22.020
 let's assemble all the bottles one 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.860
 on top of the other and then with this cutter 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:27.550
 I'm going to make some little windows for all 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.770
 The bottles 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.400
 I'm going to teach how to plant 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.829
 a garlic 

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.180
 they will sow everything is the same as this is 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:40.280
 makes the window with the cutter 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:44.670
 you put the little eye up 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:47.970
 and now with the tip up 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.120
 and smooth it down 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:54.030
 well we put it like that 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:57.030
 you see the tip up as it is 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.190
 look like this 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.530
 we sink it and cover it a little 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:06.680
 earth like this 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:10.420
 amazing look like I said I did the 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:13.220
 windows in the bottles 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.050
 I put the garlic 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.600
 after making the little window smith and 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:19.160
 the garlic I buried a little bit is about 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.670
 days a little bit ally I could not follow 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:25.040
 with the video I could not mount a 

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.570
 bottle on top of the other have been 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.260
 loose 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:32.020
 and nature does not wait for me this has 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:35.379
 started to 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:40.229
 look to germinate and I have enough 

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:40.229
 garlic here look at this creamy 

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:44.459
 hello friends here is the garden 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:47.069
 working perfectly have passed 

00:04:44.459 --> 00:04:50.220
 a few days a couple of weeks and 

00:04:47.069 --> 00:04:54.170
 the garlics are coming out perfectly 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.170
 here you see how everything is 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:05:02.550
 and if some germ can not leave the 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:05.070
 bottle will be help 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.980
 I have seen that the last one is not necessary 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:12.470
 the deposit bottle because we 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.470
 we can pour the water directly here 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:18.360
 your 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:20.720
 and with the plug with the hole makes the 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.720
 drip 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.610
 greetings see you later
