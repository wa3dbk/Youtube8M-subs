acquired big gold and she's pretty big
bigger<00:00:21.600> than<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.100> big<00:00:23.100> eagle<00:00:23.519> which

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
bigger than the big eagle which

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.490 
bigger than the big eagle which
surprised<00:00:24.330> me<00:00:24.980> but<00:00:25.980> just<00:00:26.400> a<00:00:27.029> beautiful<00:00:27.510> belt<00:00:28.199> I

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
surprised me but just a beautiful belt I

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.069 
surprised me but just a beautiful belt I
mean<00:00:29.689> etching<00:00:30.689> could<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.990> deeper<00:00:32.899> that<00:00:33.899> goes

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
mean etching could be deeper that goes

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:42.410 
mean etching could be deeper that goes
for<00:00:34.290> all<00:00:34.399> replicas<00:00:35.399> but<00:00:35.430> I<00:00:36.469> mean<00:00:38.360> this<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:41.420> if

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
for all replicas but I mean this one if

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.950 
for all replicas but I mean this one if
you<00:00:42.540> can<00:00:42.629> hear<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.020> but<00:00:44.180> the<00:00:45.180> side<00:00:45.450> plates<00:00:45.780> on

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
you can hear that but the side plates on

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.340 
you can hear that but the side plates on
this<00:00:46.140> Beltre<00:00:46.500> are<00:00:46.920> very<00:00:47.340> well<00:00:47.610> lynched<00:00:48.350> even

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.939 
this Beltre are very well lynched even
more<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:49.829> than<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.070> front<00:00:50.430> plate<00:00:51.230> but<00:00:54.949> it's

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
more so than the front plate but it's

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.180 
more so than the front plate but it's
actually<00:00:56.190> pretty<00:00:56.610> good<00:00:56.850> i<00:00:56.910> like<00:00:57.180> it<00:00:58.039> what<00:00:59.039> i<00:00:59.070> do
