and either one work beautiful and if

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.310 
and either one work beautiful and if

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
you're starting out with this I do

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.880 
you're starting out with this I do
recommend<00:00:37.770> using<00:00:38.100> a<00:00:38.399> cream<00:00:39.149> or<00:00:39.390> foundation

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 
recommend using a cream or foundation

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.010 
recommend using a cream or foundation
because<00:00:40.890> it's<00:00:41.129> going<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:42.059> a<00:00:42.090> lot<00:00:42.450> easier<00:00:42.480> to

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
because it's going to be a lot easier to

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.139 
because it's going to be a lot easier to
blend<00:00:43.260> if<00:00:44.100> you're<00:00:44.309> having<00:00:44.610> trouble<00:00:44.940> finding

your<00:00:45.480> natural<00:00:45.899> cheekbone<00:00:46.410> I<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:47.460> suck<00:00:47.760> in

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
your natural cheekbone I would suck in

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060 
your natural cheekbone I would suck in
your<00:00:47.969> face<00:00:48.360> just<00:00:48.660> like<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:48.870> fish<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.410> you<00:00:49.860> will

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
your face just like a fish and you will

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.130 
your face just like a fish and you will
see<00:00:50.309> where<00:00:50.700> the<00:00:50.910> line<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.449> cheekbone<00:00:51.840> is

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
see where the line of your cheekbone is

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.990 
see where the line of your cheekbone is
and<00:00:52.440> if<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.100> are<00:00:53.280> having<00:00:53.579> trouble<00:00:53.850> finding

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
and if you are having trouble finding

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.880 
and if you are having trouble finding
your<00:00:54.210> cheekbones<00:00:54.719> that<00:00:54.989> probably<00:00:55.590> means<00:00:55.800> that

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
your cheekbones that probably means that

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:57.950 
your cheekbones that probably means that
they're<00:00:56.100> not<00:00:56.250> as<00:00:56.399> prominent<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:57.149> your<00:00:57.719> face

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
they're not as prominent on your face

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.619 
they're not as prominent on your face
naturally<00:00:58.680> so<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.039> would<00:00:59.399> not<00:00:59.670> extend<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
naturally so I would not extend the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.860 
naturally so I would not extend the
contour<00:01:01.469> all<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:02.100> way<00:01:02.219> down<00:01:02.430> too<00:01:02.730> close<00:01:03.690> to

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
contour all the way down too close to

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.080 
contour all the way down too close to
the<00:01:03.960> mouth<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> would<00:01:04.439> keep<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.979> just<00:01:05.729> about<00:01:05.939> an

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the mouth I would keep it just about an

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.359 
the mouth I would keep it just about an
inch<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> half<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:07.020> two<00:01:07.200> inches<00:01:07.590> down<00:01:08.130> your

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
inch and a half to two inches down your

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.340 
inch and a half to two inches down your
cheek<00:01:08.549> bone<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.720> it's<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> look<00:01:10.229> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
cheek bone because it's going to look a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.050 
cheek bone because it's going to look a
little<00:01:10.500> bit<00:01:10.680> more<00:01:10.860> obvious<00:01:11.250> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.430> fully

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
little bit more obvious if you fully

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.330 
little bit more obvious if you fully
drawn<00:01:12.420> cheek<00:01:12.810> bones<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.320> are<00:01:13.560> not<00:01:13.799> naturally

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
drawn cheek bones that are not naturally

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:15.320 
drawn cheek bones that are not naturally
there<00:01:14.520> if<00:01:14.610> that<00:01:14.760> makes<00:01:14.939> sense

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
there if that makes sense

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.480 
there if that makes sense
so<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.689> wouldn't<00:01:16.380> recommend<00:01:16.650> doing<00:01:16.950> that<00:01:17.009> but

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
so I wouldn't recommend doing that but

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.820 
so I wouldn't recommend doing that but
you<00:01:17.549> can<00:01:17.850> still<00:01:18.180> do<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.659> contour<00:01:19.080> as<00:01:19.320> dramatic

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
you can still do the contour as dramatic

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.170 
you can still do the contour as dramatic
as<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.280> on<00:01:20.369> your<00:01:20.430> forehead<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.060> your

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
as you want on your forehead and your

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
as you want on your forehead and your
chin<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:22.170> reason<00:01:22.439> you<00:01:22.530> do<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:22.950> your

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
chin and the reason you do it on your

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.770 
chin and the reason you do it on your
forehead<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.060> give<00:01:24.270> yourself<00:01:24.659> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
forehead is just to give yourself a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
forehead is just to give yourself a
little<00:01:24.810> bit<00:01:25.229> more<00:01:25.290> dimension<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.159> face

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
little bit more dimension to the face

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.819 
little bit more dimension to the face
and<00:01:26.700> if<00:01:27.570> you<00:01:27.689> have<00:01:27.930> sort<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.619> bigger

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
and if you have sort of a bigger

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:30.770 
and if you have sort of a bigger
forehead<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.549> you<00:01:29.610> want<00:01:29.820> it<00:01:29.909> to<00:01:29.939> appear<00:01:30.600> a

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
forehead and you want it to appear a

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.770 
forehead and you want it to appear a
little<00:01:31.259> bit<00:01:31.470> shorter<00:01:32.400> or<00:01:32.640> smaller<00:01:33.090> contouring

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
little bit shorter or smaller contouring

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.749 
little bit shorter or smaller contouring
the<00:01:33.990> top<00:01:34.200> and<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.650> sides<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.460> going<00:01:35.670> to

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
the top and the sides is really going to

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:37.910 
the top and the sides is really going to
draw<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:36.869> in<00:01:37.020> and<00:01:37.320> it's<00:01:37.439> going<00:01:37.619> to<00:01:37.710> make<00:01:37.799> your

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
draw it in and it's going to make your

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.890 
draw it in and it's going to make your
forehead<00:01:38.369> appear<00:01:38.549> smaller<00:01:39.329> so<00:01:39.720> that's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
forehead appear smaller so that's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
forehead appear smaller so that's
definitely<00:01:40.140> something<00:01:40.380> that's<00:01:40.650> good<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.220> you

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
definitely something that's good if you

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:53.579 
done I would totally recommend using a

00:06:53.579 --> 00:06:55.969 
done I would totally recommend using a
very<00:06:53.969> firm<00:06:54.419> brush<00:06:54.749> for<00:06:55.169> blending<00:06:55.499> out<00:06:55.800> your

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:55.979 
very firm brush for blending out your

00:06:55.979 --> 00:06:58.009 
very firm brush for blending out your
contour<00:06:56.399> and<00:06:56.610> if<00:06:57.179> you<00:06:57.269> don't<00:06:57.539> have<00:06:57.719> a<00:06:57.749> firm

00:06:58.009 --> 00:06:58.019 
contour and if you don't have a firm

00:06:58.019 --> 00:06:59.779 
contour and if you don't have a firm
brush<00:06:58.259> then<00:06:58.559> I<00:06:58.709> recommend<00:06:59.039> using<00:06:59.339> a<00:06:59.519> cream

00:06:59.779 --> 00:06:59.789 
brush then I recommend using a cream

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.029
