00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:56.930 
and this is what connects to your camera

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:03.750 
and this is what connects to your camera
because<00:00:57.880> the<00:00:58.880> 3100<00:00:59.240> does<00:00:59.720> not<00:00:59.930> have

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.499

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
nice I have the capabilities to connect

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:10.859 
nice I have the capabilities to connect
to<00:01:07.869> rip<00:01:08.409> so<00:01:08.770> you<00:01:08.830> need<00:01:09.070> over<00:01:09.520> to<00:01:09.970> make<00:01:10.630> the

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:10.869 
to rip so you need over to make the

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.720 
to rip so you need over to make the
shuttle

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.410 

he<00:01:14.970> has<00:01:15.180> a<00:01:16.340> skin<00:01:17.340> on<00:01:17.550> it<00:01:18.380> so<00:01:19.460> here<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.850> comes

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
he has a skin on it so here it comes

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.900 
he has a skin on it so here it comes
along<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.780> bottom<00:01:22.110> and<00:01:22.410> unfortunately<00:01:23.160> this

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:23.910 
along the bottom and unfortunately this

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.399 
along the bottom and unfortunately this
needs<00:01:24.300> to<00:01:24.450> be<00:01:24.540> flush<00:01:25.140> up<00:01:25.380> against<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.190> camera

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
needs to be flush up against the camera

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.210 
needs to be flush up against the camera
this<00:01:29.409> gets

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.090 

because<00:01:33.490> it<00:01:34.000> it<00:01:34.990> works<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.770> just<00:01:35.920> stretch

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
because it it works and just stretch

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.750 
because it it works and just stretch
over

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.580 

do

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:41.590 
do

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.730 
do
take<00:01:41.979> off<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.969> battery<00:01:43.149> door<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:44.560> it<00:01:44.649> out<00:01:44.710> a

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
take off the battery door put it out a

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:54.179 
take off the battery door put it out a
45<00:01:45.159> degree<00:01:45.280> angle<00:01:45.429> and<00:01:46.329> you<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.719> pop<00:01:47.229> it<00:01:47.259> off

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:54.189 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.190 

there's<00:01:54.549> this<00:01:54.759> little<00:01:55.030> door<00:01:55.240> here<00:01:55.270> actually

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
there's this little door here actually

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.840 
there's this little door here actually
another<00:01:56.590> reason<00:01:56.860> I<00:01:56.950> like<00:01:57.130> this<00:01:57.310> is<00:01:57.520> because<00:01:57.549> it

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
another reason I like this is because it

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:59.370 
another reason I like this is because it
doesn't<00:01:58.000> say<00:01:58.180> lock<00:01:58.420> in<00:01:58.719> big<00:01:59.049> white<00:01:59.229> letters

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
doesn't say lock in big white letters

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:05.039 
doesn't say lock in big white letters
and<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.579> doesn't<00:02:00.850> look<00:02:00.909> as<00:02:01.030> cheap<00:02:04.049> here's

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
and it doesn't look as cheap here's

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.480 
and it doesn't look as cheap here's
where<00:02:05.350> your<00:02:05.619> batteries<00:02:05.920> there's<00:02:06.369> these

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
then you already start and the GPS is

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.670 
then you already start and the GPS is
the<00:03:16.390> top

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
the top

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.540 
the top
plug<00:03:19.310> up<00:03:20.239> here

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
plug up here

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:28.910 
plug up here
Oh

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.280 

and<00:03:29.190> make<00:03:29.880> sure<00:03:29.910> it's<00:03:30.150> tight<00:03:30.420> because<00:03:31.050> the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
and make sure it's tight because the

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:34.040 
and make sure it's tight because the
first<00:03:31.440> time<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:31.770> did<00:03:31.980> it<00:03:32.010> it<00:03:32.220> didn't<00:03:32.520> work<00:03:32.550> and<00:03:33.050> I

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
first time I did it it didn't work and I

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.080 
first time I did it it didn't work and I
thought<00:03:34.230> maybe<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.709> was<00:03:34.830> broken<00:03:35.130> but<00:03:35.610> it<00:03:35.940> was

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.090 
thought maybe it was broken but it was

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:43.410 
thought maybe it was broken but it was
just<00:03:37.730> and<00:03:38.730> then<00:03:39.300> you<00:03:39.660> can<00:03:39.930> turn

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.150 

just<00:03:44.020> as<00:03:44.140> I<00:03:44.410> forgot<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.280> have

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:46.160 
just as I forgot I have

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.620 
just as I forgot I have
manual

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
manual

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:57.190 
manual
right<00:03:47.840> now<00:03:47.960> so<00:03:48.320> I<00:03:48.350> can<00:03:48.620> show<00:03:48.740> you

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.170 

so

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
so

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.380 
so
can<00:03:59.590> use<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.620> camera<00:04:00.860> normal

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
can use the camera normal

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:07.030 
can use the camera normal
and<00:04:02.630> you<00:04:03.500> just<00:04:03.680> take<00:04:04.370> your<00:04:04.490> pictures<00:04:04.819> focus<00:04:06.040> or

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:07.040 
and you just take your pictures focus or

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:08.980 
and you just take your pictures focus or
you<00:04:07.250> can<00:04:07.430> flip<00:04:07.670> it<00:04:07.760> this<00:04:07.850> way<00:04:08.030> and<00:04:08.209> the<00:04:08.780> switch

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 
you can flip it this way and the switch

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:14.170 
you can flip it this way and the switch
is<00:04:09.110> on<00:04:09.490> you<00:04:10.490> can<00:04:11.020> also<00:04:12.020> take<00:04:12.200> pictures<00:04:13.180> just

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
is on you can also take pictures just

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.699 
is on you can also take pictures just
the<00:04:14.270> focus<00:04:14.480> and<00:04:14.690> everything<00:04:14.810> but<00:04:15.440> if<00:04:15.590> the

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
the focus and everything but if the

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:22.210 
the focus and everything but if the
switch<00:04:15.890> is<00:04:15.920> off<00:04:17.230> nothing<00:04:18.230> happens<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:21.220> it

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:22.220 
switch is off nothing happens so it

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:27.010 
switch is off nothing happens so it
gives<00:04:22.580> you<00:04:22.880> a<00:04:24.400> pretty<00:04:25.400> substantial<00:04:25.580> grip<00:04:26.210> here

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
gives you a pretty substantial grip here

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.980 
gives you a pretty substantial grip here
it<00:04:27.710> gives<00:04:27.830> you<00:04:28.010> a<00:04:28.400> little<00:04:28.820> bit<00:04:28.970> more<00:04:29.150> size<00:04:29.450> to<00:04:29.960> a

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:29.990 
it gives you a little bit more size to a

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.110 
it gives you a little bit more size to a
small<00:04:30.290> camera<00:04:30.590> which<00:04:31.550> is<00:04:31.700> nice<00:04:32.950> I'm<00:04:33.950> not<00:04:34.280> very

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.120 
small camera which is nice I'm not very

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.180 
small camera which is nice I'm not very
big<00:04:35.450> so<00:04:35.810> I<00:04:35.840> don't<00:04:36.110> need<00:04:36.290> you<00:04:36.500> know<00:04:36.590> a<00:04:36.620> big<00:04:36.950> huge

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
big so I don't need you know a big huge

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:39.130 
big so I don't need you know a big huge
grip<00:04:37.460> and<00:04:37.760> kind<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.030> tiny<00:04:38.210> so<00:04:38.510> this<00:04:38.720> works<00:04:38.930> just

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:39.140 
grip and kind of tiny so this works just

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.230 
grip and kind of tiny so this works just
fine<00:04:39.290> for<00:04:39.350> me<00:04:39.680> there<00:04:40.190> are<00:04:40.340> bigger<00:04:40.610> ones<00:04:40.700> there

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
fine for me there are bigger ones there

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:43.450 
fine for me there are bigger ones there
are<00:04:41.270> square<00:04:41.690> ones<00:04:42.050> but<00:04:42.440> one<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.100> the<00:04:43.190> reasons<00:04:43.400> I

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
are square ones but one of the reasons I

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.030 
are square ones but one of the reasons I
like<00:04:43.610> this<00:04:43.669> is<00:04:44.150> because<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.990> reason<00:04:45.140> this

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:46.040 
like this is because the reason this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:49.090 
like this is because the reason this
curves<00:04:46.580> like<00:04:47.330> that<00:04:47.570> follows<00:04:48.169> the<00:04:48.320> camera

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100 
curves like that follows the camera

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.810 
curves like that follows the camera
being<00:04:49.640> big<00:04:49.790> square<00:04:50.270> and<00:04:50.419> blocking<00:04:51.610> but<00:04:52.610> I

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
being big square and blocking but I

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:55.640 
being big square and blocking but I
personally<00:04:53.330> don't

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.050 

so<00:04:56.190> yeah<00:04:56.310> the<00:04:56.910> there's<00:04:57.449> a<00:04:57.710> tripod<00:04:58.910> place<00:04:59.910> at

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
so yeah the there's a tripod place at

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.730 
so yeah the there's a tripod place at
the<00:05:00.150> bottom<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:01.110> group<00:05:01.860> itself<00:05:02.270> is<00:05:03.270> kind<00:05:03.510> of<00:05:03.630> a

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:03.740 
the bottom the group itself is kind of a

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.280 
the bottom the group itself is kind of a
white<00:05:04.740> plastic

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:07.290 
white plastic

00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:10.370 
white plastic
and<00:05:07.770> kind<00:05:08.010> of<00:05:08.100> expect<00:05:08.430> that<00:05:08.520> this<00:05:09.030> it<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.570> it

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
and kind of expect that this it just it

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.290 
and kind of expect that this it just it
is

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:13.300 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.420 

I<00:05:13.330> don't<00:05:13.930> really<00:05:14.229> I<00:05:14.650> can't<00:05:15.039> really<00:05:15.130> comment

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
I don't really I can't really comment

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.540 
I don't really I can't really comment
about<00:05:15.759> the<00:05:15.910> color<00:05:16.259> because<00:05:17.259> I<00:05:17.289> wear<00:05:17.680> RI<00:05:18.039> Cuba's

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
about the color because I wear RI Cuba's

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.940 
about the color because I wear RI Cuba's
skin<00:05:18.789> online

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
skin online

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.939 
skin online
seems<00:05:21.310> to<00:05:21.460> be<00:05:21.610> alright

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:23.949 
seems to be alright

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.999 
seems to be alright
it's<00:05:24.669> got<00:05:24.939> a<00:05:24.969> speckle<00:05:25.659> pattern<00:05:25.930> if<00:05:26.740> you<00:05:26.830> can

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:27.009 
it's got a speckle pattern if you can

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.239 
it's got a speckle pattern if you can
see<00:05:27.249> that<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.810> it's<00:05:28.960> kind<00:05:29.229> of<00:05:29.289> similar<00:05:29.560> to<00:05:29.949> an

00:05:30.239 --> 00:05:30.249 
see that but it's kind of similar to an

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:37.950 
see that but it's kind of similar to an
icon<00:05:30.749> plastic<00:05:33.330> the<00:05:34.330> only<00:05:34.569> thing<00:05:34.810> I've<00:05:35.110> noticed

00:05:37.950 --> 00:05:37.960 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:42.129 

the<00:05:38.960> screw<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.039> holds<00:05:40.099> it<00:05:40.669> on<00:05:40.909> goes<00:05:41.840> all<00:05:42.110> the

00:05:42.129 --> 00:05:42.139 
the screw that holds it on goes all the

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:44.529 
the screw that holds it on goes all the
way<00:05:42.289> through<00:05:42.620> to<00:05:42.740> the<00:05:42.830> front<00:05:43.129> and<00:05:43.729> so<00:05:44.150> I'm

00:05:44.529 --> 00:05:44.539 
way through to the front and so I'm

00:05:44.539 --> 00:05:46.810 
way through to the front and so I'm
holding

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:46.820 
holding

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:48.340 
holding
and<00:05:47.090> it<00:05:47.210> loosens<00:05:47.390> which<00:05:48.020> could<00:05:48.260> be

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
and it loosens which could be

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.470 
and it loosens which could be
problematic<00:05:48.760> just<00:05:49.760> gotta<00:05:49.910> make<00:05:50.210> sure<00:05:50.270> you

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:50.480 
problematic just gotta make sure you

00:05:50.480 --> 00:06:13.090 
problematic just gotta make sure you
keep<00:05:50.660> that<00:05:50.840> tight<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.440> it<00:05:51.590> should<00:05:51.770> be<00:05:51.890> okay

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:13.100 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.269 

sorry<00:06:13.820> to

00:06:15.269 --> 00:06:15.279
