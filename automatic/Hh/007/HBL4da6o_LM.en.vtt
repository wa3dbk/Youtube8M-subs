00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
right now because i obviously it's a

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.510 
right now because i obviously it's a

little bit on a blend side so you know

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.010 
little bit on a blend side so you know
it's<00:02:41.700> good<00:02:41.760> for<00:02:42.150> you<00:02:42.330> know<00:02:42.420> just<00:02:42.630> get<00:02:42.780> out<00:02:42.930> of

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020
