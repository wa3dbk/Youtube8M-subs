00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 after the hundredth request of the arz 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.980
 Let's send yours 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.230
 I wanted the printer settings 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.549
 only possible answer in several 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.619
 Upload small videos 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.690
 who did not understand the link now 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.609
 Unfortunately, there are no settings 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.890
 on all printers fits printer art 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.660
 drive extruder filament diameter 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.000
 Color or manufacturer generate one 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.519
 count of possible basic settings and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.040
 to see through the whole body 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.120
 to keep my way like me now 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.840
 when i start a new printer 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.180
 set up 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360
 then we start with the primal scream one 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:43.379
 arduino cc and then we load ourselves 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.039
 the newest arduino version the 105th 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.219
 I shut down for mac os in parallel 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.260
 I'll invite you on rapid i.com right now 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:55.050
 current favorite firmware for the 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.640
 printer down there I like to do too 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.430
 advertising the developers in the region 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.520
 make great work also own wishes 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.489
 are implemented very quickly so the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:08.040
 We can be the newest otherwise 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.619
 you're going to repeat it with us 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.439
 loading up here are the windows and 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.710
 linux version of the horst is thanks to you 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:20.070
 the pc program that the connection to 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.759
 the printer and the individual 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.750
 commands to the printer relay like that 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:26.520
 while here now a bit before 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.619
 I can just lay down once 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.560
 bit lame at the printer I 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.990
 now here is a judge a mendel 90 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.180
 imitation with prosa compatible parts 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.630
 and housing and who's clear for it 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:42.150
 interested in the thing is called gap dzr 40k 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 and link is a description of who 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.630
 wants to know where to go because of the 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.850
 Can complain printer called this can 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:51.000
 right in the comments do because of 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.040
 uw / h ptz 40k is my cerebral cortex 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.210
 sprung 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.950
 Of course I could download that 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200
 simply forward, but like all 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.570
 youtube beginner on me naturally rich 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.909
 to become and is just such a long 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.759
 video just better you can with 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.330
 security understand the mist 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.070
 now pulled on the desktop 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.840
 I try this here so clearly 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.670
 that's why it is 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.590
 even such a Spartan system right now 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.310
 because here is really only what 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.760
 one must see installed under windows 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 he now the programs under mac os 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.520
 of course only unpack 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:32.110
 domino was still the rapper ti 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:36.100
 hest I use the way arduino 105th 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.840
 with retails firmware I 'm not 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.390
 sure but I believe in malin 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.280
 and at sprinter the new one works 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:47.370
 arduino version not there you have one 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.810
 arduino 0.23 take that only so marginally 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.030
 we still hear relatively unpacked 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.910
 and then the first hurdle would be already 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:56.590
 successfully mastered that was the 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.600
 easiest part next time you go 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:03.870
 then the configuration of the firmware and 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:03.870
 the upload to the arduino quiz
