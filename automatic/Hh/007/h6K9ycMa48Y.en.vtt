all other storage is stored on the NASS

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.299 
all other storage is stored on the NASS
and<00:00:54.329> this<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.750> one<00:00:55.050> point<00:00:55.289> at<00:00:55.770> the<00:00:55.890> moment

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
and this is a one point at the moment

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.549 
and this is a one point at the moment
it's<00:00:56.399> configured<00:00:56.969> with<00:00:57.149> 1.7<00:00:58.219> terabytes<00:00:59.239> of

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:00.559 
it's configured with 1.7 terabytes of

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.490 
it's configured with 1.7 terabytes of
that<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.800> lot<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.190> that's<00:01:02.370> redundant<00:01:02.940> space<00:01:03.500> so

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that a lot of that's redundant space so

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.440 
that a lot of that's redundant space so
it<00:01:04.619> actually<00:01:04.949> packs<00:01:05.189> up<00:01:05.489> so<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.880> if<00:01:06.000> one<00:01:06.180> disk

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it actually packs up so that if one disk

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.020 
it actually packs up so that if one disk
dies<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:07.080> others<00:01:07.320> are<00:01:07.470> still<00:01:07.680> available

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
dies the others are still available

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.789 
dies the others are still available
alright<00:01:09.030> so<00:01:09.270> back<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.479> my<00:01:09.750> automation<00:01:10.350> system

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
alright so back to my automation system

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.539 
alright so back to my automation system
so<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> have<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:12.000> Home<00:01:12.180> Server<00:01:12.950> which<00:01:13.950> runs<00:01:14.250> on

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so I have the Home Server which runs on

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:19.100 
so I have the Home Server which runs on
a<00:01:14.610> UPS<00:01:15.799> and<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.950> keeps<00:01:17.280> internet<00:01:18.150> server

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
a UPS and this keeps internet server

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.550 
a UPS and this keeps internet server
essential<00:01:20.009> services<00:01:20.580> up<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:21.479> runtime<00:01:21.930> varies

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
essential services up the runtime varies

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.520 
essential services up the runtime varies
depending<00:01:23.040> on<00:01:23.159> the<00:01:23.220> load<00:01:23.720> on<00:01:24.720> average<00:01:25.290> it's

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
depending on the load on average it's

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.969 
depending on the load on average it's
about<00:01:25.619> 30<00:01:26.250> minutes<00:01:26.930> that<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.170> run<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.650> 4

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
about 30 minutes that it will run in 4

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.810 
about 30 minutes that it will run in 4
if<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.369> power<00:01:29.610> goes<00:01:29.670> off<00:01:30.710> which<00:01:31.710> is<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.640> than

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
if the power goes off which is more than

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.319 
if the power goes off which is more than
enough<00:01:34.040> if<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> power<00:01:35.430> is<00:01:35.460> off<00:01:35.700> for<00:01:35.850> much<00:01:36.000> more

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
enough if the power is off for much more

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.210 
enough if the power is off for much more
than<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.750> there's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.380> much<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.619> I<00:01:37.920> can<00:01:37.950> do

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
than that there's not much that I can do

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:39.069 
than that there's not much that I can do
anyway

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 
anyway

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.130 
anyway
what<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.950> from<00:01:41.640> the<00:01:41.790> home<00:01:41.970> automation<00:01:42.210> system

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
what so from the home automation system

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.469 
what so from the home automation system
I<00:01:44.130> have<00:01:44.729> a<00:01:45.210> current<00:01:45.659> cost<00:01:46.790> MV<00:01:47.790> which<00:01:48.060> basically

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
I have a current cost MV which basically

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.380 
I have a current cost MV which basically
just<00:01:48.630> means<00:01:49.110> that<00:01:49.710> either<00:01:49.920> it<00:01:50.880> reads<00:01:51.149> the

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
just means that either it reads the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.389 
just means that either it reads the
power<00:01:51.630> usage<00:01:52.049> of<00:01:52.200> the<00:01:52.350> whole<00:01:52.530> house<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.189> as<00:01:53.310> you

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
power usage of the whole house so as you

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.230 
power usage of the whole house so as you
can<00:01:53.520> see<00:01:53.579> on<00:01:53.820> here<00:01:54.229> 712<00:01:55.229> what<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.909> current

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
can see on here 712 what is the current

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.719 
can see on here 712 what is the current
usage<00:01:58.850> I've<00:01:59.850> got<00:02:00.210> modem<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.990> router<00:02:01.579> set<00:02:02.579> in

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
usage I've got modem and router set in

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.149 
usage I've got modem and router set in
bridge<00:02:03.240> mode<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> router<00:02:04.290> handles<00:02:04.860> all

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
bridge mode so the router handles all

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.290 
bridge mode so the router handles all
the<00:02:05.490> authentication<00:02:07.520> and<00:02:08.520> then<00:02:08.759> up<00:02:08.910> here<00:02:08.940> I

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
the authentication and then up here I

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.410 
the authentication and then up here I
have<00:02:09.619> W<00:02:10.619> 800

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
have W 800

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.220 
have W 800
which<00:02:12.020> is<00:02:12.290> essentially<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.960> radio<00:02:14.960> receiver

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
which is essentially a radio receiver

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.760 
which is essentially a radio receiver
for<00:02:16.010> motion<00:02:16.220> sentence<00:02:16.910> much<00:02:17.540> like<00:02:17.840> this

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
for motion sentence much like this

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.610 
for motion sentence much like this
extend<00:02:19.610> the<00:02:19.700> motion<00:02:20.060> sensor<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.200> house

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
extend the motion sensor so the house

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.949 
extend the motion sensor so the house
knows<00:02:22.040> because<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:23.090> the<00:02:23.180> door<00:02:23.390> and<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> window

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
knows because of the door and the window

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:26.140 
knows because of the door and the window
sensors<00:02:24.500> and<00:02:24.709> everything<00:02:25.100> else<00:02:25.280> being

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
sensors and everything else being

sensors and everything else being
received<00:02:26.540> by<00:02:26.780> this<00:02:26.959> device<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.100> then

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:28.610 
received by this device and then

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:30.940 
received by this device and then
processed<00:02:29.480> by<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.810> automation<00:02:30.290> computer

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 
processed by the automation computer

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.800 
processed by the automation computer
exactly<00:02:33.340> what<00:02:34.340> rooms<00:02:34.610> got<00:02:34.850> motion<00:02:35.150> what<00:02:35.600> room

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
exactly what rooms got motion what room

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.520 
exactly what rooms got motion what room
doesn't<00:02:36.110> and<00:02:36.500> so<00:02:36.830> on<00:02:37.720> so<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:38.900> I<00:02:39.050> also<00:02:39.230> have

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
doesn't and so on so then I also have

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.400 
doesn't and so on so then I also have
this<00:02:40.180> RF<00:02:41.180> XCOM<00:02:42.100> receiver<00:02:43.100> this<00:02:43.970> is<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.630> similar

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
this RF XCOM receiver this is a similar

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.410 
this RF XCOM receiver this is a similar
receiver<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.100> last<00:02:46.370> one<00:02:46.730> it's<00:02:47.000> just<00:02:47.239> on<00:02:47.390> a

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
receiver to the last one it's just on a

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.509 
receiver to the last one it's just on a
different<00:02:47.630> frequency<00:02:47.980> so<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.160> one<00:02:49.400> is

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
different frequency so this one is

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:54.940 
different frequency so this one is
responsible<00:02:49.970> for<00:02:51.459> 80<00:02:52.459> I<00:02:52.670> remotes<00:02:53.800> which<00:02:54.800> will

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:54.950 
responsible for 80 I remotes which will

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:57.520 
responsible for 80 I remotes which will
shortly<00:02:55.250> be<00:02:55.519> integrated<00:02:56.209> into<00:02:56.360> the<00:02:56.570> TV<00:02:56.959> system

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
shortly be integrated into the TV system

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:03.640 
shortly be integrated into the TV system
and<00:02:57.830> also<00:02:58.370> temperature<00:02:58.700> sensors<00:03:01.420> so<00:03:02.420> I<00:03:02.930> also

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
and also temperature sensors so I also

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.220 
and also temperature sensors so I also
have<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:03.950> pager<00:03:04.489> receiver<00:03:04.880> which<00:03:05.540> is<00:03:05.570> connected

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 
have a pager receiver which is connected

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.310 
have a pager receiver which is connected
into<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:06.739> same<00:03:07.010> system<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:08.300> pager<00:03:08.630> messages

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:09.320 
into the same system so pager messages

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.130 
into the same system so pager messages
can<00:03:09.590> be<00:03:09.620> received<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.720> controlling<00:03:11.720> all<00:03:11.840> of
