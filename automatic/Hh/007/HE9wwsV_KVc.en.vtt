00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello to all and welcome back some of you 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.029
 the antennas will have already risen and a 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.950
 read the title because also the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.410
 we are keen to face a legend 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.420
 very deep rooted underground where 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.030
 the dogs that do the same 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.650
 how many of you have heard 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:19.050
 tales of the right owners me 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.010
 prevented hoped that after a long 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
 work day 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.689
 let's go home and yes, it doesn't have much 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.369
 totally upset the other dogs 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.310
 then they really have a fantasy 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.170
 perverse in choosing the damage to be done 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.360
 for example let us list them can 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.239
 nibbling carpets and gnawing furniture 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.149
 gnawing at walls rather than 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:41.899
 destroy shoes glasses remote controls 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.370
 cell phones and so on and so forth 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.110
 therefore owner thinks that the masters 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.170
 doing than it has been in 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.809
 home alone but let's try to whom 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.690
 What comes out of spite is respect 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.329
 we could define it as a gesture put 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.469
 intentionally in place 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.670
 to harm someone 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.920
 here our dogs are animals 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.799
 managers yes but fortunately they are not 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.680
 able to do respects for medications 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.119
 or to plan a revenge on ours 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.080
 damage 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.240
 we are lucky so you ask 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240
 because it is therefore khalifa the years there 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.650
 rates may be 1 business reasons 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:30.990
 like to chew two could be born on 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:34.229
 change of 23 tries to calm down 4 suffers 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.140
 suffers from separation anxiety at 5 yes 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.320
 he is simply bored then 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.570
 we see from the dogs that there is chewing itself 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.340
 as we see it every day instead 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.970
 rock is a fact indeed they come 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.890
 Even the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.660
 own buffalo skin bones for 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.480
 this reason you will see that yes 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.610
 take the vineyards chew a lot 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:56.620
 the action of chewing actually causes 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.020
 the release of endorphins which are the 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:01.930
 hormones so to speak of the welfare of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.990
 pleasure that make us feel good 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.880
 in fact, even as we do sport yes 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.860
 causes the release of endorphins or 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.140
 when we eat the chocolate I already have 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.750
 said it all, so understand that they are there 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:18.120
 of the activities to the reports that done 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 they are paid more by caterpillar per se 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.780
 or I was saying it's changing its teeth though 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.940
 we need not worry in this case 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.130
 because it is a transitional period the 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.150
 behavior once events have changed 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.240
 and on its own without further 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:36.940
 trail or is trying to 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.250
 calm down because I give an example of it 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.800
 back home we see the damage there 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.020
 we get angry back to the dog but you already have 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.209
 learned that if the punishment too 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.300
 distant from the moment when khajari 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.800
 done the damage however the action 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.840
 dear fails to connect the two events 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.500
 and therefore the projection is unexpected e 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.110
 senseless in his eyes 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.110
 this creates them a state of anxiety of 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:08.769
 insecurity and the dog will then try to 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.769
 calm down like linke way before mine 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.750
 point was chewing just because how 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:17.200
 this makes him feel better 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.880
 you see that then a loop is generated a 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.010
 vicious circle from which it is difficult 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.810
 go out if we don't do the first one 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.850
 step 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.290
 or I said the dog could suffer 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.970
 we also do the separation 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.970
 I hope it is not yours 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.860
 case because this is a real one 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.320
 behavioral problem that as such 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.180
 must therefore be addressed with the support of 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.390
 a behaviorist veterinary doctor 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.690
 is 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:45.650
 behavioral rehabilitator or 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.480
 dog is simply bored 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.540
 maybe you have a puppy is a young man 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:54.410
 energetic dog a camp at work 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:57.260
 for more and leave too much time to 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.610
 alone or did not vent all his 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.700
 energies 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.260
 if you leave the dog for only eight hours 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:05.420
 from morning to night i'm not 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.489
 for it is absolutely to find again some damages 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:09.590
 just because anyway the dog to gods 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:11.540
 his basic needs they must 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.760
 be respected first of all if 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:17.239
 these are not respected yes 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:19.940
 will create various problems and find 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:22.010
 the damage can only be one of these 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.080
 or dog has not vented hopes e 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.360
 if before leaving her you only have them 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.380
 let's just go around the block not 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.220
 could run to use explore 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.890
 probably also in this case 

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:35.810
 damage and would certainly not be his fault 

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:38.710
 because even in this case it was not 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.050
 first met his needs 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.850
 then you will ask ok but because it goes to 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.340
 take the first objects the objects of 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:50.950
 home and full of games yet there is 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:55.040
 own Mexican things I can understand the 

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:57.169
 bother the fact that the value anyway 

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:59.570
 of objects is also a value 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:02.810
 therefore shared if the family no 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:05.150
 value to certain things and not to others 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.350
 also for the dog to apply can have 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.120
 this trend 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:12.110
 so if we use every day 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.570
 cell phone shoes on the remote control 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.850
 magazines and we do not come to a look at 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.500
 his plush he probably in between 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.760
 same 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.200
 also the things that call you also 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.150
 on our duty which I am also the 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.890
 more interesting for that though you do 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.650
 attention you play with its games that 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:30.740
 otherwise there is no week I ask 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:33.169
 so recapping the declines you don't 

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:34.820
 respect therefore not punished for this 

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.260
 reason instead seek to go to understand 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:37.990
 what are the causes of this 

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:40.480
 behavior 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.100
 because truly understanding is the first 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.070
 step to cure 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.890
 I recommend then I greet you there 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:51.250
 See you next week with a 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:57.090
 episode of the strong also this is a 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.090
 very big hello from the kidneys in via Sistine
