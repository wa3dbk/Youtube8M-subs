00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:08.540
 hello hello this is bessie call of duty 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.540
 black ops declassified 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.260
 not 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.739
 yes now the name of this series is akin 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.690
 curses but here it seems like on vita 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.970
 come out interesting to see even 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.370
 despite the fact that the game did not 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.410
 infinity ward is not a treyarch but an office 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.910
 made 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.159
 resistance burning skyys 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.320
 know and so all zagnobili in due time and 

00:00:46.159 --> 00:00:50.600
 I don't know. By the way, I liked it. 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.640
 it was hard not to guess that so 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.530
 hesitated all the series does not burn us 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.320
 nothing mind-blowing 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.330
 and most importantly new especially from the side up 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.280
 so far about ticking guys from the book 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:03.979
 the game went on the first day 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.049
 literally in one gulp I could not tear myself away 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.130
 all because the company is so 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:12.770
 chic that takes less than an hour 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.479
 10 missions under 5 minutes not to pass 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.130
 so that I am greatly saddened by this 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:22.460
 the turn of events is just a game worth 2000 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:25.759
 but do not rush to be upset there is regime 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.189
 time tests are 5 minute tasks 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.439
 by 3 and that's not all 

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:33.200
 many loved and still love black 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.140
 ops precisely for zombie mode which 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.090
 first appeared in all that word 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.659
 the portable version of course its 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.240
 cut the fuck they put the regime 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:46.729
 survival against ordinary soldiers stupid 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.470
 such know genocide wave after wave 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:53.590
 wave after wave is very exciting and 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.450
 and to me actually from all these 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.880
 offline have those find any 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.100
 Challenge for amateur shooter of course 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.560
 can only be found in the company because 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.340
 she is very hardcore and due to this 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.530
 may cause some interest or 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.660
 so you know crisp on your 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:12.580
 a woman like me when I am 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.410
 I tried to go on the most difficult 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.920
 still constantly give them saved for all sorts 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.080
 your actions only she is not clear here 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.290
 why do I need but in terms of plot 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.630
 I didn't understand a damn thing besides 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.050
 what we play is called pelvic mason 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.570
 then again they are called then again for Mason and 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.530
 late we kill amid the snowfall of 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:38.170
 cocaine by some type left nobody 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:41.050
 Menendez and in shaggy 1982 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:43.959
 and his little son flees and we 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.750
 then we will meet him only in normal 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.700
 playing black ops 2 as the main villain 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:51.100
 someone might find this a spoiler 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.140
 someone to thank for the hour saved 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.720
 life and a few not spent 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.220
 wasted rubles or what do you have there 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:59.459
 amazing that in call of duty black 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.709
 ops 2 class fight is still something 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.690
 interesting this multiplayer is there like 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.370
 usually we gain experience we open new 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.980
 weapons whose choice by the way is enough 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.750
 good at creating style 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.640
 my classes and all that stuff 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.790
 the only thing is the maximum amount 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.220
 players there equals 8 some cards for 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.100
 such mass batches 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.470
 it seems too big because 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.750
 can be worn back and forth and in the end 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.700
 I met no one for a minute and here 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.269
 I probably have a lot of loved ones 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.310
 Newtown brutally castrated stupidly about 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.560
 half q already small map 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:38.260
 although even in this form I like it 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.910
 most in terms of dynamics in general 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:41.709
 game mechanics here multiplayer is not 

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:43.360
 such a curve as at resistance burning 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.549
 skyce for example but amid hundreds 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.560
 fritulejny jokers on unity or 3 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:49.989
 bucks out on the android ios 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:52.600
 It looks much better to me but 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:54.370
 bezrybe where classroom fight will be okay us 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.280
 option is it worth buying call of duty 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:58.900
 black ops 2 class five not guys 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.150
 save money and for something 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.480
 more intelligent or make a friend 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:04.190
 buy this game and on 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.709
 the next day you can already come and 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.650
 take it play especially since online 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.620
 pass but no it is by the way very important very 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:14.269
 raw though well played from 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.579
 challenge here is only joy for 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:18.919
 hardcore trail hunters see a slew of 

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:21.500
 three stars on missions but for those who donâ€™t 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:23.270
 driven by quite tolerable multiplayer 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.940
 In general, I really liked the game and 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.220
 I will play online but I will obviously not 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.900
 It is worth its money exactly as well as 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.870
 nigi leaf is not worth doing anymore 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.570
 500 rubles shooters would be just right 

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:37.820
 well, you know, but I have this 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:42.550
 it was all denis fight so 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:42.550
 bye bye and of course to new meetings
