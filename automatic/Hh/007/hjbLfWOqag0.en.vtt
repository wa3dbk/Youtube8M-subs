did is i came up with the reverse

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.960 
did is i came up with the reverse
training<00:00:27.510> method<00:00:28.369> and<00:00:29.369> how<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.550> use<00:00:29.730> it<00:00:29.880> to

well big believer in reward-based

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.569 
well big believer in reward-based
training<00:00:50.989> if<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:52.289> about<00:00:52.379> it

00:00:52.569 --> 00:00:52.579 
training if you think about it

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.889 
training if you think about it
everything<00:00:53.579> we<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:55.219> reward<00:00:56.219> driven

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
everything we do is reward driven

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.889 
everything we do is reward driven
seriously<00:00:57.899> how<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> guys<00:00:59.329> would<00:01:00.329> continue

paycheck too many so what we do is we go

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.030 
paycheck too many so what we do is we go
to<00:01:06.450> work<00:01:06.659> work<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.260> week<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.770> the<00:01:07.860> end<00:01:07.950> of

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
to work work all week and at the end of

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.890 
to work work all week and at the end of
week<00:01:08.159> we<00:01:08.310> know<00:01:08.340> we<00:01:08.430> get<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:08.790> paycheck<00:01:09.270> then<00:01:09.810> we

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
week we know we get to paycheck then we

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.030 
week we know we get to paycheck then we
go<00:01:10.020> back<00:01:10.049> and<00:01:10.350> following<00:01:10.650> week<00:01:10.799> in<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
go back and following week in the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.039 
go back and following week in the
following<00:01:11.340> week<00:01:11.520> who's<00:01:12.150> those<00:01:12.360> checks<00:01:12.689> stop

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
following week who's those checks stop

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.030 
following week who's those checks stop
coming<00:01:13.130> guess<00:01:14.130> what<00:01:15.259> we<00:01:16.259> stopped<00:01:16.530> working

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
coming guess what we stopped working

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.760 
coming guess what we stopped working
it's<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:17.970> same<00:01:18.180> thing<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.509> their<00:01:18.659> dogs<00:01:18.869> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
it's the same thing with their dogs we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.910 
it's the same thing with their dogs we
need<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.580> use<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:21.030> reward-based<00:01:21.540> training

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
need to use a reward-based training

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.620 
need to use a reward-based training
program<00:01:22.920> because<00:01:23.640> it's<00:01:23.790> better<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.390> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
program because it's better for you and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
program because it's better for you and
it's<00:01:24.869> much<00:01:25.200> much<00:01:25.530> better<00:01:25.770> for<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.130> dog<00:01:26.340> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
it's much much better for your dog a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.660 
it's much much better for your dog a
couple<00:01:27.570> ways<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:28.049> train<00:01:28.229> your<00:01:28.320> dog

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
couple ways that you can train your dog

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.819 
couple ways that you can train your dog
it<00:01:29.670> all<00:01:29.850> comes<00:01:30.090> down<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.329> consequences<00:01:30.930> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
it all comes down to consequences you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.679 
it all comes down to consequences you
can<00:01:32.040> give<00:01:32.189> your<00:01:32.310> dog<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.520> positive<00:01:33.119> consequence

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
can give your dog a positive consequence

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.270 
can give your dog a positive consequence
for<00:01:33.840> doing<00:01:34.079> something<00:01:34.290> or<00:01:34.680> you<00:01:34.920> can<00:01:35.100> give<00:01:35.250> them

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
for doing something or you can give them

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.700 
for doing something or you can give them
a<00:01:35.579> negative<00:01:36.060> consequence<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.869> what<00:01:37.290> happens

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
a negative consequence and what happens

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.289 
a negative consequence and what happens
is<00:01:37.890> they<00:01:38.250> look<00:01:38.430> forward<00:01:38.790> to<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.150> positive

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
is they look forward to the positive

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.899 
is they look forward to the positive
consequence<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.229> they<00:01:40.350> do<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.590> behavior<00:01:41.040> when

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
consequence so they do the behavior when

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.370 
consequence so they do the behavior when
you're<00:01:42.060> using<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.390> negative<00:01:42.780> consequence

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
you're using a negative consequence

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.370 
you're using a negative consequence
they'll<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.579> behavior<00:01:45.149> to<00:01:45.450> avoid<00:01:45.869> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
they'll do the behavior to avoid the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.380 
they'll do the behavior to avoid the
negative<00:01:46.530> consequence<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:48.090> think<00:01:48.299> about

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
negative consequence so think about

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.649 
negative consequence so think about
going<00:01:48.659> back<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:48.930> work<00:01:49.259> imagine<00:01:50.250> that<00:01:50.430> again<00:01:51.420> a

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
going back to work imagine that again a

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.719 
going back to work imagine that again a
check<00:01:52.020> every<00:01:52.170> week<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:53.280> you're<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.670> to

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
check every week right you're going to

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.760 
check every week right you're going to
keep<00:01:53.850> doing<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.180> work<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.590> not

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
keep doing the work if you're not

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.170 
keep doing the work if you're not
getting<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.159> check<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.579> someone's<00:01:56.909> forcing

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
getting the check and someone's forcing

forcing you to do the behavior chances

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.550 
forcing you to do the behavior chances
are<00:02:17.240> you're<00:02:18.240> going<00:02:18.330> to<00:02:18.420> try<00:02:18.630> to<00:02:18.660> run<00:02:19.110> when<00:02:19.470> you

retaliate<00:02:21.060> become<00:02:21.810> aggressive<00:02:22.020> on<00:02:22.380> that

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
retaliate become aggressive on that

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.930 
retaliate become aggressive on that
person<00:02:22.860> that's<00:02:23.040> forcing<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.700> do<00:02:23.820> the

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
person that's forcing you to do the

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.640 
person that's forcing you to do the
behavior<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:24.540> so<00:02:24.900> when<00:02:25.080> it<00:02:25.170> comes<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.500> dog

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
behavior and so when it comes to dog

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.440 
behavior and so when it comes to dog
training<00:02:25.680> think<00:02:26.250> about<00:02:26.460> it<00:02:26.610> would<00:02:27.120> you<00:02:27.270> dog

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
training think about it would you dog

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.200 
training think about it would you dog
rather<00:02:27.870> work<00:02:28.260> for<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.620> reward<00:02:29.070> for<00:02:29.460> work<00:02:29.700> to

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
rather work for a reward for work to

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.850 
rather work for a reward for work to
avoid<00:02:30.540> some<00:02:31.290> type<00:02:31.500> of<00:02:31.530> negative<00:02:31.980> consequence

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
avoid some type of negative consequence

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.430 
avoid some type of negative consequence
got<00:02:34.860> so<00:02:35.580> reward-based<00:02:36.060> training<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.870> the<00:02:37.320> way

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
got so reward-based training is the way

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.900 
got so reward-based training is the way
you<00:02:37.500> should<00:02:37.590> train<00:02:37.920> your<00:02:38.070> dog<00:02:38.220> there's<00:02:38.760> a<00:02:38.880> lot

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
you should train your dog there's a lot

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.550 
you should train your dog there's a lot
of<00:02:39.120> ways<00:02:39.360> you<00:02:39.390> can<00:02:39.660> reward<00:02:39.840> your<00:02:40.080> dog<00:02:40.170> some

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
of ways you can reward your dog some

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.130 
of ways you can reward your dog some
people<00:02:40.800> say<00:02:40.920> well<00:02:41.070> I'd<00:02:41.190> never<00:02:41.670> ever<00:02:42.330> use<00:02:42.660> food

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140

people say well I'd never ever use food
to<00:02:43.200> train<00:02:43.590> my<00:02:43.740> dog<00:02:43.770> that's<00:02:44.490> ridiculous<00:02:44.640> why

to train my dog that's ridiculous why

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.460

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
not dogs like food use it to reward the

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.050 
not dogs like food use it to reward the
behavior<00:02:49.560> will<00:02:50.250> end<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.490> dogs<00:02:50.670> only<00:02:50.850> going<00:02:51.000> to

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
behavior will end the dogs only going to

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.030 
behavior will end the dogs only going to
work<00:02:51.150> for<00:02:51.210> food<00:02:51.540> ok<00:02:52.470> what<00:02:52.770> are<00:02:52.830> you<00:02:52.890> working

doesn't mean that you have to walk

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:04.790 
doesn't mean that you have to walk
around<00:03:03.240> pockets<00:03:03.870> full<00:03:03.990> of<00:03:04.050> hot<00:03:04.290> dogs<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:04.710> the

beginning use some food to reward the

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:10.910 
beginning use some food to reward the
