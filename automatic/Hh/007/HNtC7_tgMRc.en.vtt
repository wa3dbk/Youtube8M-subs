free-for-all<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.279> actually<00:00:23.279> tend<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.970> shy<00:00:24.150> away

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
free-for-all I actually tend to shy away

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.210 
free-for-all I actually tend to shy away
from<00:00:24.420> free-for-all<00:00:24.990> because<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.500> find<00:00:26.070> it

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:26.220 
from free-for-all because I do find it

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.359 
from free-for-all because I do find it
to<00:00:26.820> be<00:00:27.090> very<00:00:27.210> camp<00:00:27.810> heavy<00:00:28.080> at<00:00:28.349> times<00:00:28.410> and

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
to be very camp heavy at times and

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.030 
to be very camp heavy at times and
really<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.670> my<00:00:30.510> selective<00:00:31.019> memory<00:00:31.320> obviously

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
really I my selective memory obviously

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.350 
really I my selective memory obviously
I'm<00:00:32.130> aware<00:00:32.369> of<00:00:32.430> it<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:32.790> makes<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.149> weird

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
I'm aware of it which makes it weird

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.630 
I'm aware of it which makes it weird
that<00:00:33.390> I'm<00:00:33.570> still<00:00:33.750> making<00:00:34.649> decisions<00:00:35.280> based<00:00:35.370> on

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
that I'm still making decisions based on

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.700 
that I'm still making decisions based on
said<00:00:36.000> selective<00:00:36.420> memory<00:00:36.719> but<00:00:37.140> my<00:00:37.230> selective

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
said selective memory but my selective

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.610 
said selective memory but my selective
memory<00:00:38.010> tells<00:00:38.250> me<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:39.300> that<00:00:39.660> I<00:00:39.719> am<00:00:40.110> prone<00:00:40.410> to

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
memory tells me that that I am prone to

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.990 
memory tells me that that I am prone to
finding<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.040> lot<00:00:41.160> more<00:00:41.219> people<00:00:41.760> that<00:00:41.879> are

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
finding a lot more people that are

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.520 
finding a lot more people that are
sitting<00:00:42.300> in<00:00:42.390> corners<00:00:42.780> with<00:00:42.989> ghosts<00:00:43.230> and

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
sitting in corners with ghosts and

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.639 
sitting in corners with ghosts and
motion<00:00:43.860> sensors<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.430> all<00:00:44.520> that<00:00:44.809> and<00:00:45.809> so<00:00:46.620> I

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
motion sensors and all that and so I

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.799 
motion sensors and all that and so I
don't<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.610> know<00:00:47.640> I<00:00:47.730> do<00:00:48.090> tend<00:00:48.510> to<00:00:48.600> shy<00:00:48.780> away

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
don't you know I do tend to shy away
