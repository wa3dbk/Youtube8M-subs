00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
the ship oh wow all right definitely our

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.200 
the ship oh wow all right definitely our
character<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:50.740> know<00:02:50.890> this<00:02:51.190> we<00:02:51.760> could<00:02:51.970> beat<00:02:52.180> it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
character you know this we could beat it

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.990 
character you know this we could beat it
but<00:02:53.140> we<00:02:53.410> just<00:02:53.830> don't<00:02:53.980> have<00:02:54.190> enough<00:02:54.520> time<00:02:54.790> to

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
but we just don't have enough time to

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.510 
but we just don't have enough time to
take<00:02:55.150> them<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.680> notice<00:02:56.680> what<00:02:56.920> I<00:02:56.950> did<00:02:57.250> there<00:02:57.490> I

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:57.520 
take them out notice what I did there I

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.340 
take them out notice what I did there I
did<00:02:57.790> I<00:02:58.000> just<00:02:58.060> took<00:02:58.330> out<00:02:58.480> those<00:02:58.660> ship<00:02:58.960> and<00:02:59.230> they

00:02:59.340 --> 00:02:59.350 
did I just took out those ship and they

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.510 
did I just took out those ship and they
can't<00:02:59.590> hit<00:02:59.770> us<00:02:59.800> anymore

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
can't hit us anymore

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.700 
can't hit us anymore
we<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.360> beat<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.780> but<00:03:01.990> I<00:03:02.080> don't<00:03:02.260> think<00:03:02.380> we<00:03:02.560> have

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
we can beat it but I don't think we have

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:04.770 
we can beat it but I don't think we have
enough<00:03:02.740> time<00:03:03.250> I<00:03:03.310> mean<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.700> Skrill<00:03:04.090> and<00:03:04.450> the

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
enough time I mean the Skrill and the

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.110 
enough time I mean the Skrill and the
and<00:03:05.110> toothless<00:03:05.950> is<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.400> not<00:03:06.550> powerful

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
and toothless is just not powerful

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.180 
and toothless is just not powerful
enough<00:03:07.300> we<00:03:08.080> might<00:03:08.290> be<00:03:08.440> able<00:03:08.560> to<00:03:08.740> make<00:03:08.890> if<00:03:09.040> they

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
enough we might be able to make if they

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.280 
enough we might be able to make if they
shoot<00:03:09.250> faster<00:03:09.880> if<00:03:10.240> I<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.570> another<00:03:10.840> Boulder

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
shoot faster if I have another Boulder

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.910 
shoot faster if I have another Boulder
to<00:03:11.440> shoot<00:03:12.300> but<00:03:13.300> actually<00:03:14.050> we<00:03:14.230> might<00:03:14.500> make<00:03:14.680> it

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
to shoot but actually we might make it

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.290 
to shoot but actually we might make it
so<00:03:15.520> that's<00:03:16.090> how<00:03:16.239> you<00:03:16.300> beat<00:03:16.600> it<00:03:16.780> Jason<00:03:18.180> go<00:03:19.180> in

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
so that's how you beat it Jason go in

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.030 
so that's how you beat it Jason go in
from<00:03:19.510> the<00:03:19.630> back<00:03:19.660> you<00:03:20.440> don't<00:03:20.590> need<00:03:20.709> to<00:03:20.770> take<00:03:20.920> out

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
from the back you don't need to take out

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.040 
from the back you don't need to take out
all<00:03:21.190> the<00:03:21.310> ship<00:03:21.550> the<00:03:21.700> thing<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.090> the<00:03:22.690> objective

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
all the ship the thing is the objective

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.160 
all the ship the thing is the objective
is<00:03:23.530> just<00:03:23.590> to<00:03:24.310> get<00:03:24.520> out<00:03:24.700> of<00:03:24.850> the<00:03:24.940> ship<00:03:25.000> sight<00:03:25.780> you

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
is just to get out of the ship sight you

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.380 
is just to get out of the ship sight you
don't<00:03:26.320> need<00:03:26.560> to<00:03:26.890> as<00:03:27.610> you<00:03:27.790> can<00:03:27.910> see<00:03:28.060> we're<00:03:28.270> not

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
don't need to as you can see we're not

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.810 
don't need to as you can see we're not
nowhere<00:03:28.660> near<00:03:29.050> level<00:03:29.410> 75<00:03:29.830> and<00:03:30.370> if<00:03:30.459> you're<00:03:30.670> at

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:30.820 
nowhere near level 75 and if you're at

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.870 
nowhere near level 75 and if you're at
level<00:03:30.970> 75<00:03:31.830> okay<00:03:32.830> I<00:03:33.100> think<00:03:33.370> we're<00:03:33.489> gonna<00:03:33.610> win

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
level 75 okay I think we're gonna win

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.610 
level 75 okay I think we're gonna win
unless<00:03:34.060> I<00:03:34.360> accidentally<00:03:34.870> tap<00:03:35.110> somewhere<00:03:35.410> and

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
unless I accidentally tap somewhere and

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.790 
unless I accidentally tap somewhere and
then<00:03:35.709> send<00:03:35.980> them<00:03:36.100> into<00:03:36.340> a<00:03:36.489> fleet<00:03:36.790> of<00:03:36.820> ship

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
then send them into a fleet of ship

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.500 
then send them into a fleet of ship
alright<00:03:38.800> so<00:03:38.950> that<00:03:39.100> is<00:03:39.130> a<00:03:39.340> strategy<00:03:39.910> to<00:03:40.180> beating

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:40.510 
alright so that is a strategy to beating

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:44.250 
alright so that is a strategy to beating
fleet<00:03:40.750> 24<00:03:41.380> at<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.920> very<00:03:42.520> very<00:03:43.060> low<00:03:43.300> chance<00:03:43.989> of

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
fleet 24 at a very very low chance of

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.630 
fleet 24 at a very very low chance of
winning<00:03:44.590> if<00:03:44.680> you're<00:03:44.800> wondering<00:03:45.250> how<00:03:45.340> to<00:03:45.400> beat

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
winning if you're wondering how to beat

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.820 
winning if you're wondering how to beat
it<00:03:45.670> that's<00:03:46.360> how<00:03:46.570> you<00:03:46.660> beat<00:03:46.930> it<00:03:47.080> and<00:03:47.260> there<00:03:47.620> we

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
it that's how you beat it and there we

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
it that's how you beat it and there we
go<00:03:48.010> alright<00:03:49.080> and<00:03:50.080> we<00:03:50.260> just<00:03:50.440> took<00:03:50.560> out<00:03:50.739> fleet<00:03:51.070> 24

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:51.850 
go alright and we just took out fleet 24

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.760 
go alright and we just took out fleet 24
I<00:03:52.120> know<00:03:52.690> two<00:03:52.840> of<00:03:53.110> our<00:03:53.200> dragons<00:03:53.620> died<00:03:53.800> but

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
I know two of our dragons died but

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.500 
I know two of our dragons died but
luckily<00:03:56.770> the<00:03:57.340> worst<00:03:57.580> dragons<00:03:58.150> die<00:03:58.270> I'm<00:03:58.360> not

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 
luckily the worst dragons die I'm not

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.120 
luckily the worst dragons die I'm not
saying<00:03:58.720> that<00:03:58.900> they're<00:03:59.230> worse<00:03:59.440> dragons<00:03:59.920> based

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:00.130 
saying that they're worse dragons based

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.150 
saying that they're worse dragons based
on<00:04:00.750> the<00:04:01.750> dragon<00:04:02.140> itself<00:04:02.560> I'm<00:04:02.770> saying<00:04:02.980> it's<00:04:03.100> the

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
on the dragon itself I'm saying it's the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.820 
on the dragon itself I'm saying it's the
worst<00:04:03.220> dragon<00:04:03.790> because<00:04:03.970> our<00:04:04.510> cloud<00:04:05.140> jumper<00:04:05.650> is

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:05.830 
worst dragon because our cloud jumper is

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.580 
worst dragon because our cloud jumper is
not<00:04:06.100> a<00:04:06.130> Titan<00:04:06.700> yet<00:04:06.910> which<00:04:07.420> means<00:04:07.660> that<00:04:07.930> it's

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
not a Titan yet which means that it's

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.979 
not a Titan yet which means that it's
not<00:04:08.739> that<00:04:08.920> strong<00:04:09.280> toothless<00:04:10.030> and<00:04:10.269> the<00:04:10.630> Skrill

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
not that strong toothless and the Skrill

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.350 
not that strong toothless and the Skrill
is<00:04:11.200> a<00:04:11.230> Titan<00:04:11.709> that's<00:04:12.370> how<00:04:12.550> you<00:04:12.610> beat<00:04:12.910> it<00:04:13.060> we<00:04:13.180> got

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
is a Titan that's how you beat it we got

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.509 
is a Titan that's how you beat it we got
only<00:04:13.540> one<00:04:13.810> key<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.380> don't<00:04:14.650> really<00:04:14.980> worry<00:04:15.280> about

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
only one key I don't really worry about

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.780 
only one key I don't really worry about
that<00:04:15.700> but<00:04:15.910> there<00:04:16.120> it<00:04:16.209> is<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:18.130> is<00:04:18.370> how<00:04:18.730> you

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:18.790 
that but there it is that is how you

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.830 
that but there it is that is how you
beat<00:04:19.390> fleet<00:04:19.870> 24
