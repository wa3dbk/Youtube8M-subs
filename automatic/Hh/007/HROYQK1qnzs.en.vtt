think<00:00:14.849> certain<00:00:15.450> seasons<00:00:16.170> should<00:00:16.859> determine

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:17.190 
think certain seasons should determine

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.349 
think certain seasons should determine
what<00:00:17.550> colors<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:18.539> appropriate<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.439> wear<00:00:19.619> but

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:20.359

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.310 
there's just something about ball that
makes<00:00:22.830> me<00:00:22.980> just<00:00:23.510> gravitate<00:00:24.510> towards<00:00:24.900> warm

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
makes me just gravitate towards warm
