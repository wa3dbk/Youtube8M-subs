borders are definitely really cool in
this<00:01:50.230> deck<00:01:50.410> but<00:01:50.680> there's<00:01:50.860> a<00:01:50.950> lot<00:01:51.310> going<00:01:51.550> on<00:01:51.880> in

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
this deck all at the same time and that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.670 
this deck all at the same time and that
might<00:01:54.760> be<00:01:55.060> a<00:01:55.090> turn<00:01:55.540> off<00:01:55.570> to<00:01:55.720> some<00:01:56.050> people<00:01:56.380> and

we get actually more into the deck of

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.210 
we get actually more into the deck of
cards<00:02:04.390> itself<00:02:04.720> but<00:02:05.170> this<00:02:05.260> back<00:02:05.530> design<00:02:05.890> is

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.710 
don't know why but they just do not hold
up<00:05:01.560> very<00:05:01.800> well<00:05:02.490> over<00:05:02.970> time<00:05:03.180> they<00:05:03.450> start<00:05:03.630> to

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
up very well over time they start to

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.780 
up very well over time they start to
clump<00:05:03.930> and<00:05:04.110> it<00:05:04.620> doesn't<00:05:04.980> really<00:05:05.070> do<00:05:05.310> well<00:05:05.550> with

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
clump and it doesn't really do well with

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.730 
clump and it doesn't really do well with
hot<00:05:06.150> or<00:05:06.330> sweaty<00:05:06.570> hands<00:05:06.840> either<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.410> think<00:05:07.650> this

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740 
hot or sweaty hands either I think this

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.950 
hot or sweaty hands either I think this
deck<00:05:08.040> looks<00:05:08.550> great<00:05:08.820> I<00:05:08.970> think<00:05:09.270> the<00:05:09.390> back<00:05:09.630> design

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:09.960 
deck looks great I think the back design

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.930 
deck looks great I think the back design
is<00:05:10.170> very<00:05:10.230> beautiful<00:05:10.980> however<00:05:11.460> there<00:05:11.760> could

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
is very beautiful however there could

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.640 
is very beautiful however there could
just<00:05:12.180> be<00:05:12.300> a<00:05:12.330> little<00:05:12.690> bit<00:05:12.900> too<00:05:13.050> much<00:05:13.200> going<00:05:13.560> on

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:13.650 
just be a little bit too much going on

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.390 
just be a little bit too much going on
in<00:05:13.950> the<00:05:14.160> overall<00:05:14.610> deck<00:05:15.450> just<00:05:16.110> because<00:05:16.500> I<00:05:16.890> mean

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:17.400 
in the overall deck just because I mean

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:19.160 
in the overall deck just because I mean
there's<00:05:17.760> a<00:05:17.820> lot<00:05:17.910> of<00:05:18.090> design<00:05:18.510> there's<00:05:18.900> a<00:05:18.960> lot<00:05:19.140> of

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.170 
there's a lot of design there's a lot of

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.290 
there's a lot of design there's a lot of
elements<00:05:19.440> in<00:05:19.860> here<00:05:20.100> tiny<00:05:20.430> things<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.090> there's

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
elements in here tiny things and there's

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.260 
elements in here tiny things and there's
just<00:05:21.540> a<00:05:21.660> really<00:05:22.230> a<00:05:22.260> lot<00:05:22.410> going<00:05:22.800> on<00:05:22.920> um<00:05:23.640> however

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
just a really a lot going on um however

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.000 
just a really a lot going on um however
you<00:05:24.630> can<00:05:24.660> definitely<00:05:25.110> tell<00:05:25.410> the

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
you can definitely tell the

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.160 
you can definitely tell the
craftsmanship<00:05:26.730> that<00:05:26.760> put<00:05:27.120> into<00:05:27.570> this<00:05:27.720> deck<00:05:28.020> of

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.170 
craftsmanship that put into this deck of

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:29.870 
craftsmanship that put into this deck of
cards<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.680> you<00:05:28.980> can<00:05:29.130> definitely<00:05:29.310> tell<00:05:29.730> how

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
cards and you can definitely tell how

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.510 
cards and you can definitely tell how
much<00:05:30.000> time<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.570> effort<00:05:30.810> it<00:05:31.230> took<00:05:31.410> and<00:05:31.650> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
much time and effort it took and the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.400 
much time and effort it took and the
deck<00:05:32.730> looks<00:05:33.210> nice<00:05:33.450> I<00:05:33.690> just<00:05:33.990> think<00:05:34.110> there's<00:05:34.320> a

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:34.410 
deck looks nice I just think there's a

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:36.230 
deck looks nice I just think there's a
little<00:05:34.560> too<00:05:34.800> much<00:05:34.980> going<00:05:35.310> on<00:05:35.400> however<00:05:35.850> like<00:05:36.120> I

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
little too much going on however like I

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:37.730 
little too much going on however like I
said<00:05:36.420> before<00:05:36.540> you<00:05:36.900> can<00:05:36.930> tell<00:05:37.230> the<00:05:37.350> time<00:05:37.530> and

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
said before you can tell the time and

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.830 
said before you can tell the time and
effort<00:05:38.010> it<00:05:38.160> took<00:05:38.310> and<00:05:38.580> put<00:05:39.030> into<00:05:39.330> this<00:05:39.480> deck<00:05:39.690> of

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:39.840 
effort it took and put into this deck of

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.440 
effort it took and put into this deck of
cards<00:05:40.080> to<00:05:40.260> make<00:05:40.470> it<00:05:40.710> so<00:05:41.400> detailed<00:05:41.880> and<00:05:42.120> so

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:42.450 
cards to make it so detailed and so

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:45.020 
cards to make it so detailed and so
detail-oriented<00:05:43.290> and<00:05:43.710> I<00:05:43.800> definitely<00:05:44.250> applaud

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
detail-oriented and I definitely applaud

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.270 
detail-oriented and I definitely applaud
them<00:05:45.630> for<00:05:45.660> that<00:05:46.080> so<00:05:46.320> this<00:05:46.470> overall<00:05:46.800> deck<00:05:47.100> i

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:47.280 
them for that so this overall deck i

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.190 
them for that so this overall deck i
would<00:05:47.370> have<00:05:47.520> to<00:05:47.550> give<00:05:47.820> a<00:05:48.120> 4<00:05:48.390> out<00:05:48.510> of<00:05:48.570> 5<00:05:48.780> my

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.200 
would have to give a 4 out of 5 my

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.110 
would have to give a 4 out of 5 my
really<00:05:49.500> biggest<00:05:49.830> complaint<00:05:50.220> is<00:05:50.370> just<00:05:50.820> a<00:05:50.940> tad

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
really biggest complaint is just a tad

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.450 
really biggest complaint is just a tad
too<00:05:51.150> much<00:05:51.420> going<00:05:51.720> on<00:05:51.810> and<00:05:52.140> that<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:53.280> doesn't

00:05:53.450 --> 00:05:53.460 
too much going on and that just doesn't

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:55.490 
too much going on and that just doesn't
really<00:05:53.730> handle<00:05:54.180> well<00:05:54.330> over<00:05:54.780> time<00:05:54.960> stock<00:05:55.320> of

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:55.500 
really handle well over time stock of

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.680 
really handle well over time stock of
this<00:05:55.650> deck<00:05:55.920> it<00:05:56.160> starts<00:05:56.760> to<00:05:56.820> feel<00:05:57.030> thin<00:05:57.330> pretty

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.690 
this deck it starts to feel thin pretty

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.870 
this deck it starts to feel thin pretty
fast<00:05:57.960> and<00:05:58.290> you<00:05:58.680> can<00:05:58.830> definitely<00:05:58.980> tell<00:05:59.340> from

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
fast and you can definitely tell from

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.460 
fast and you can definitely tell from
just<00:05:59.940> like<00:06:00.360> messing<00:06:00.720> around<00:06:00.840> with<00:06:01.170> the<00:06:01.290> deck

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:01.470 
just like messing around with the deck

00:06:01.470 --> 00:06:03.890 
just like messing around with the deck
so<00:06:01.710> the<00:06:01.830> stock<00:06:02.070> I<00:06:02.250> would<00:06:02.430> have<00:06:02.580> to<00:06:02.730> give<00:06:02.910> a<00:06:03.210> 3

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:03.900 
so the stock I would have to give a 3

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:06.110 
so the stock I would have to give a 3
out<00:06:04.140> of<00:06:04.200> 5<00:06:04.530> the<00:06:04.890> look<00:06:05.100> at<00:06:05.190> this<00:06:05.310> deck<00:06:05.670> in<00:06:05.880> my

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.120 
out of 5 the look at this deck in my

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.490 
out of 5 the look at this deck in my
opinion<00:06:06.450> there's<00:06:06.690> just<00:06:06.840> a<00:06:06.930> little<00:06:07.260> too<00:06:07.380> much

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:07.500 
opinion there's just a little too much

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:10.340 
opinion there's just a little too much
going<00:06:07.830> on<00:06:07.920> however<00:06:08.550> i<00:06:08.760> kno<00:06:08.930> how<00:06:09.930> much<00:06:09.990> time<00:06:10.110> and

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
going on however i kno how much time and

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:13.460 
going on however i kno how much time and
effort<00:06:10.590> it<00:06:10.860> took<00:06:11.040> to<00:06:11.120> create<00:06:12.120> this<00:06:12.930> detail

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
effort it took to create this detail

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.950 
effort it took to create this detail
oriented<00:06:14.070> of<00:06:14.220> a<00:06:14.280> deck<00:06:14.490> and<00:06:14.700> that's<00:06:15.120> definitely

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:15.960 
oriented of a deck and that's definitely

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.080 
oriented of a deck and that's definitely
something<00:06:16.110> that<00:06:16.350> needs<00:06:16.680> to<00:06:16.800> be<00:06:16.890> applauded<00:06:17.370> so

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
something that needs to be applauded so

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:20.410 
something that needs to be applauded so
this<00:06:18.240> overall<00:06:18.540> look<00:06:18.840> I<00:06:18.990> would<00:06:19.140> have<00:06:19.320> to<00:06:19.470> give<00:06:19.650> a

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:20.420 
this overall look I would have to give a

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:23.720 
this overall look I would have to give a
3.8<00:06:21.420> out<00:06:22.140> of<00:06:22.410> 5<00:06:22.560> handling<00:06:23.070> and<00:06:23.190> feel<00:06:23.340> this<00:06:23.520> deck

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
3.8 out of 5 handling and feel this deck

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.330 
3.8 out of 5 handling and feel this deck
as<00:06:23.940> I<00:06:23.970> said<00:06:24.210> before<00:06:24.240> it<00:06:24.990> definitely<00:06:25.410> just<00:06:25.770> does

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:26.340 
as I said before it definitely just does

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:28.520 
as I said before it definitely just does
not<00:06:26.550> hold<00:06:27.180> up<00:06:27.330> too<00:06:27.600> well<00:06:27.630> over<00:06:28.140> time<00:06:28.290> it

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:28.530 
not hold up too well over time it

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:29.780 
not hold up too well over time it
doesn't<00:06:28.710> really<00:06:28.950> do<00:06:29.130> good<00:06:29.310> with<00:06:29.430> hot<00:06:29.640> or

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:29.790 
doesn't really do good with hot or

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:31.310 
doesn't really do good with hot or
sweaty<00:06:30.000> hands<00:06:30.270> and<00:06:30.510> it<00:06:30.900> definitely<00:06:31.080> just

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:31.320 
sweaty hands and it definitely just

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.150 
sweaty hands and it definitely just
degrades<00:06:31.770> a<00:06:31.919> lot<00:06:32.100> faster

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.160 
degrades a lot faster

00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.620 
degrades a lot faster
and<00:06:33.250> other<00:06:33.400> decks<00:06:33.700> over<00:06:34.120> the<00:06:34.210> handling<00:06:34.510> and
