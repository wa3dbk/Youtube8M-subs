showing you this is a shot from downtown
denver<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:32.940> imagine<00:01:33.570> that<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.260> if<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.470> had

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
denver but imagine that what if you had

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.940 
denver but imagine that what if you had
this<00:01:34.890> super<00:01:35.490> fast<00:01:35.790> of<00:01:36.210> a<00:01:36.570> UFO<00:01:36.960> flying<00:01:37.740> all

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
this super fast of a UFO flying all

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.710 
this super fast of a UFO flying all
around<00:01:37.979> in<00:01:38.400> your<00:01:38.430> endeavor<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.150> mean<00:01:39.479> what

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
around in your endeavor I mean what

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.300 
around in your endeavor I mean what
would<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.020> think<00:01:40.049> about<00:01:40.409> that<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:41.040> saw

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
would you think about that if you saw

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100 
would you think about that if you saw
but<00:01:41.340> that's<00:01:41.790> a<00:01:42.119> little<00:01:42.420> bit<00:01:42.510> of<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.659> wrinkle

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
but that's a little bit of a wrinkle

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.649 
but that's a little bit of a wrinkle
right<00:01:43.320> there<00:01:43.560> because<00:01:43.880> apparently<00:01:44.880> it's<00:01:45.240> so

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
right there because apparently it's so

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.399 
right there because apparently it's so
fast<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.560> it's<00:01:47.010> difficult<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:48.030> see<00:01:48.360> with<00:01:49.140> the

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
fast that it's difficult to see with the

about maybe it's debris I don't know
about<00:02:55.500> that<00:02:55.620> because<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.250> was<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.460> really

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
about that because it was just really

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.450 
about that because it was just really
fast<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:57.720> flying<00:02:57.990> pretty<00:02:58.260> high<00:02:58.350> for<00:02:58.890> being

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
fast and flying pretty high for being

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
have in my Proserpine really weird

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.750 
have in my Proserpine really weird
movements<00:03:06.810> you<00:03:07.680> know<00:03:07.800> jerky<00:03:08.220> movements<00:03:08.640> the

one person who was presenting talking

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:12.380 
one person who was presenting talking
about<00:03:10.410> looks<00:03:11.160> like<00:03:11.310> fire<00:03:11.580> or<00:03:11.790> thruster<00:03:12.210> I

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
about looks like fire or thruster I

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:13.910 
about looks like fire or thruster I
don't<00:03:12.750> know<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:12.900> certainly<00:03:13.410> couldn't<00:03:13.740> get<00:03:13.890> a

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
don't know I certainly couldn't get a

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.500 
don't know I certainly couldn't get a
good<00:03:14.100> enough<00:03:14.220> look<00:03:14.370> at<00:03:14.580> it<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.790> say<00:03:15.000> anything

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
good enough look at it to say anything

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:19.340 
good enough look at it to say anything
like<00:03:15.750> that<00:03:15.810> but<00:03:16.770> it<00:03:17.220> did<00:03:17.970> move<00:03:18.270> in<00:03:18.600> sort<00:03:19.020> of<00:03:19.080> odd

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
like that but it did move in sort of odd

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.100 
like that but it did move in sort of odd
ways<00:03:20.280> and<00:03:20.730> then<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.880> was<00:03:20.970> kind<00:03:21.209> of<00:03:21.240> like<00:03:21.390> like

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
ways and then it was kind of like like

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.420 
ways and then it was kind of like like
kind<00:03:22.380> of<00:03:22.440> floating<00:03:22.920> and<00:03:23.070> flipping<00:03:23.340> around

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
kind of floating and flipping around

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.870 
kind of floating and flipping around
sort<00:03:24.270> of<00:03:24.390> in<00:03:24.840> weird<00:03:25.110> ways<00:03:25.200> at<00:03:25.620> times<00:03:25.860> but<00:03:26.760> it

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
sort of in weird ways at times but it

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.850 
sort of in weird ways at times but it
did<00:03:27.030> look<00:03:27.060> how<00:03:27.390> small<00:03:27.780> at<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.200> same<00:03:28.380> time<00:03:28.440> so

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
did look how small at the same time so

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.949 
did look how small at the same time so
it's<00:03:28.950> like<00:03:28.980> how<00:03:29.280> would<00:03:29.430> you<00:03:29.550> fit<00:03:30.420> anybody<00:03:30.810> in

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
it's like how would you fit anybody in

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.840 
it's like how would you fit anybody in
there<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.680> sizing<00:03:32.220> that<00:03:32.370> I<00:03:32.400> was<00:03:32.610> getting

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
there if the sizing that I was getting

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.680 
there if the sizing that I was getting
from<00:03:33.000> the<00:03:33.090> video<00:03:33.360> is<00:03:33.740> correct<00:03:35.570> what<00:03:36.570> I'm

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
from the video is correct what I'm

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.990 
from the video is correct what I'm
thinking<00:03:37.230> as<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.530> possibility<00:03:38.280> and<00:03:38.670> you<00:03:38.760> tell

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
thinking as a possibility and you tell

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.070 
thinking as a possibility and you tell
me<00:03:39.030> what<00:03:39.209> you<00:03:39.300> think<00:03:39.480> about<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.840> i'm

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:40.080 
me what you think about this i'm

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.910 
me what you think about this i'm
thinking<00:03:40.440> maybe<00:03:41.330> perhaps<00:03:42.500> it's<00:03:43.500> something

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
thinking maybe perhaps it's something

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.620 
thinking maybe perhaps it's something
like<00:03:45.560> you<00:03:46.560> know<00:03:46.620> some<00:03:47.010> kind<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.630> remote

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
like you know some kind of remote

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.290 
like you know some kind of remote
control<00:03:49.380> type<00:03:50.070> of<00:03:50.250> situation<00:03:50.820> like<00:03:51.030> maybe

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
control type of situation like maybe

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.140 
control type of situation like maybe
remote<00:03:51.720> control<00:03:52.110> for<00:03:52.470> a<00:03:52.530> model<00:03:53.220> type<00:03:53.790> of<00:03:53.940> thing

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
remote control for a model type of thing

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.510 
remote control for a model type of thing
or<00:03:54.420> some<00:03:55.110> kind<00:03:55.290> of<00:03:55.320> drone<00:03:55.590> technology<00:03:55.830> or
