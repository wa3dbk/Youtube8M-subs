of<00:02:14.100> doing<00:02:15.030> highlights<00:02:15.510> and<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:17.190> once<00:02:17.490> this

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
of doing highlights and then once this

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.900 
of doing highlights and then once this
is<00:02:17.910> done<00:02:17.940> and<00:02:18.450> we<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.780> down<00:02:18.810> just<00:02:19.620> pass<00:02:20.550> the
