00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
something but I kind of grit raised by

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.479 
something but I kind of grit raised by
drift<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.559> any<00:00:37.710> way<00:00:37.890> like<00:00:38.070> most<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.430> our

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
and get into a rhythm now let's see what

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.280 
and get into a rhythm now let's see what
this<00:01:31.430> cars<00:01:31.670> got<00:01:31.910> and<00:01:32.570> the<00:01:32.720> moment<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:33.110> kind

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
this cars got and the moment it's kind

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.630 
this cars got and the moment it's kind
of<00:01:33.320> low<00:01:33.470> angle<00:01:35.890> but<00:01:36.890> like<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:37.070> said<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.370> having

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
of low angle but like I said I having

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.330 
of low angle but like I said I having
grit<00:01:37.820> racing<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:38.800> kind<00:01:39.800> of<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:40.010> different

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
grit racing so kind of a different

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.790 
grit racing so kind of a different
change<00:01:40.580> from<00:01:41.570> trying<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:41.990> keep<00:01:42.260> it<00:01:42.440> from

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
change from trying to keep it from

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.920 
change from trying to keep it from
actually<00:01:43.220> sliding<00:01:43.490> out<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:44.000> actually<00:01:44.390> want<00:01:44.720> it

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
actually sliding out to actually want it

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.480 
actually sliding out to actually want it
to<00:01:45.110> slide<00:01:45.290> out<00:01:45.470> soon<00:01:47.890> yeah<00:01:48.890> if<00:01:48.950> I<00:01:49.100> get<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:49.340> win

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
to slide out soon yeah if I get the win

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.160 
to slide out soon yeah if I get the win
then<00:01:49.940> that's<00:01:50.780> pretty<00:01:51.050> much<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.260> cars<00:01:51.590> on<00:01:51.770> down

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
then that's pretty much the cars on down

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:55.780 
then that's pretty much the cars on down
if<00:01:54.170> I<00:01:54.260> don't<00:01:54.440> get<00:01:54.530> the<00:01:54.620> win<00:01:54.740> putting<00:01:55.670> cuz

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:55.790 
if I don't get the win putting cuz

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.280 
if I don't get the win putting cuz
that's<00:01:55.940> on<00:01:56.060> an<00:01:56.150> epic<00:01:56.450> in<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.570> game<00:01:59.290> that's

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
that's on an epic in the game that's

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.600 
that's on an epic in the game that's
what<00:02:00.410> everyone<00:02:00.650> says<00:02:00.680> the<00:02:00.980> light<00:02:01.160> well<00:02:01.460> you

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
what everyone says the light well you

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.860 
what everyone says the light well you
don't<00:02:01.730> come<00:02:01.970> first<00:02:02.210> and<00:02:02.420> forces<00:02:02.750> so<00:02:02.840> that

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:02.870 
don't come first and forces so that

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.840 
don't come first and forces so that
doesn't<00:02:03.260> mean<00:02:03.380> you're<00:02:03.530> less<00:02:03.770> like<00:02:04.040> whenever<00:02:04.610> I

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:04.850 
doesn't mean you're less like whenever I

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.090 
doesn't mean you're less like whenever I
ever<00:02:05.240> said<00:02:05.570> I'm<00:02:05.840> the<00:02:05.990> best<00:02:06.170> for<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:06.890> drift

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
ever said I'm the best for the drift

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.040 
ever said I'm the best for the drift
than<00:02:07.280> never<00:02:07.550> I'm<00:02:08.180> probably<00:02:08.600> not<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:08.990> the

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
than never I'm probably not in the

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.960 
than never I'm probably not in the
middle<00:02:09.320> pack<00:02:09.500> remove<00:02:09.860> like<00:02:10.070> everyone<00:02:10.429> I'm<00:02:10.760> not

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
middle pack remove like everyone I'm not
