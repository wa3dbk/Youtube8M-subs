was<00:01:34.439> just<00:01:34.619> pretty<00:01:34.829> much<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> standard<00:01:35.400> are

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
was just pretty much the standard are

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.090 
was just pretty much the standard are
those<00:01:36.450> stock<00:01:36.689> pickups<00:01:37.049> on<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.350> as<00:01:37.500> well<00:01:37.619> yes

gate built into it as well as it being a

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.199 
gate built into it as well as it being a
really<00:02:48.390> gutsy<00:02:49.019> versatile<00:02:49.860> lab<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.060> can

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209
