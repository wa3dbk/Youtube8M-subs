also a really good fun car to just drive
online<00:00:44.640> it<00:00:45.539> really<00:00:46.350> steps<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.670> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
online it really steps out on the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.600 
online it really steps out on the
accelerator<00:00:48.149> if<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.809> not<00:00:48.960> careful<00:00:49.610> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
you put too much gas on it gets you

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.029 
you put too much gas on it gets you
really<00:00:53.550> nice<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.090> tuned<00:00:54.329> up<00:00:54.570> with<00:00:54.989> using<00:00:55.199> how

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
really nice and tuned up with using how

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.639 
really nice and tuned up with using how
you<00:00:56.100> use<00:00:56.370> your<00:00:56.399> accelerator<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:57.120> brake<00:00:57.180> and

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
you use your accelerator and brake and

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.000 
you use your accelerator and brake and

kind a factor to Germany I think when

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.360 
kind a factor to Germany I think when
you<00:02:35.010> get<00:02:35.190> big<00:02:35.879> undulation<00:02:36.450> zand<00:02:37.220> like<00:02:38.220> that

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
you get big undulation zand like that

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.770 
you get big undulation zand like that

was just playing around this going front

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.819 
was just playing around this going front
clearly<00:02:57.390> clearly<00:02:57.720> I'm<00:02:57.959> faster<00:02:58.349> than<00:02:58.500> the

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
clearly clearly I'm faster than the

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.970 
clearly clearly I'm faster than the
number<00:02:59.040> 73<00:02:59.959> but<00:03:00.959> it's<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.650> psychological

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:01.980 
number 73 but it's a psychological

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.690 
number 73 but it's a psychological
battle<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.780> see<00:03:03.780> as<00:03:03.989> he<00:03:04.170> loses<00:03:04.530> it<00:03:04.680> and<00:03:04.799> dense<00:03:05.519> my

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
battle I see as he loses it and dense my

actual the shape of the rear of the car
it's<00:03:16.109> a<00:03:16.169> bit<00:03:16.380> must<00:03:16.919> have<00:03:17.040> a<00:03:17.069> bit<00:03:17.220> of<00:03:17.310> a<00:03:17.400> fetish

it's a bit must have a bit of a fetish
for<00:03:18.090> rear<00:03:18.870> ends<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:21.980> it<00:03:22.980> is<00:03:23.099> a<00:03:23.130> really<00:03:23.459> nice

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
he liked his driving smooth like a

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.170 
he liked his driving smooth like a
little<00:03:47.819> schoolgirl<00:03:48.470> taking<00:03:49.470> their<00:03:49.590> time

skipping and not causing any trouble but

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:01.339 
skipping and not causing any trouble but
that<00:03:56.370> can<00:03:56.489> only<00:03:56.549> last<00:03:56.790> for<00:03:56.909> so<00:03:57.060> long<00:03:57.450> and<00:03:58.670> so<00:04:00.349> I

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:01.349 
that can only last for so long and so I

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:06.979 
that can only last for so long and so I
decided<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:05.269> wonder<00:04:06.269> whether<00:04:06.390> change<00:04:06.750> which

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
decided to wonder whether change which

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.170 
decided to wonder whether change which
changed<00:04:07.290> the<00:04:07.319> tone<00:04:07.560> for<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.859> start<00:04:08.129> got<00:04:08.459> dark<00:04:08.700> so

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
changed the tone for a start got dark so

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.330 
changed the tone for a start got dark so
I<00:04:09.209> decided<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.840> just<00:04:10.440> did<00:04:10.950> some<00:04:11.099> messing

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
I decided to just did some messing

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:12.680 
I decided to just did some messing
around<00:04:11.400> for<00:04:11.700> a<00:04:11.760> lap<00:04:11.909> so<00:04:12.120> much<00:04:12.359> you<00:04:12.480> can<00:04:12.599> get

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
around for a lap so much you can get

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.849 
around for a lap so much you can get
away<00:04:12.810> with<00:04:13.049> this<00:04:13.109> car<00:04:13.379> how<00:04:13.530> much<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.769> can

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
away with this car how much you can

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:15.949 
away with this car how much you can
actually<00:04:14.269> spin<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.420> around<00:04:15.480> it's<00:04:15.720> actually

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
actually spin it around it's actually

this<00:04:47.460> would<00:04:47.580> be<00:04:47.610> really<00:04:47.880> good<00:04:48.210> to<00:04:48.330> try<00:04:48.539> with<00:04:48.750> a

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
this would be really good to try with a

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.330 
this would be really good to try with a
server<00:04:49.050> where<00:04:49.410> rather<00:04:49.650> than<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:49.949> crummy<00:04:50.669> g25

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:52.340

but<00:04:53.340> it's<00:04:53.430> really<00:04:53.669> nice<00:04:53.760> to<00:04:53.820> have<00:04:54.090> a<00:04:54.270> car<00:04:54.479> in

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
but it's really nice to have a car in

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:57.260 
but it's really nice to have a car in
