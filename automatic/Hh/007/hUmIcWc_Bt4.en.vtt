to a high grade in terms of quality or

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.590 
to a high grade in terms of quality or
so<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.130> seems<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.580> all<00:00:17.699> put<00:00:17.880> together<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.150> let's

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
so it seems is all put together so let's

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.779 
so it seems is all put together so let's
take<00:00:18.810> a<00:00:18.840> look<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.199> see<00:00:19.350> how<00:00:19.470> it<00:00:19.619> stacks<00:00:19.920> up<00:00:20.160> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
take a look and see how it stacks up and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:22.220 
take a look and see how it stacks up and
when<00:00:21.000> he's<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.240> put<00:00:21.480> together<00:00:21.600> I<00:00:21.840> think<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
when he's all put together I think the

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.269 
when he's all put together I think the
first<00:00:22.439> thing<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.710> you'll<00:00:22.859> notice<00:00:22.949> is<00:00:23.250> just

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
first thing that you'll notice is just

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.009 
first thing that you'll notice is just
how<00:00:23.490> many<00:00:23.640> colors<00:00:24.150> there<00:00:24.359> are<00:00:24.390> all<00:00:24.660> over<00:00:24.930> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
how many colors there are all over the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
how many colors there are all over the
place<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:25.949> silver<00:00:26.430> is<00:00:26.550> going<00:00:26.609> to<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> little

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
place the silver is going to be a little

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.790 
place the silver is going to be a little
bit<00:00:27.330> bland<00:00:27.630> I'd<00:00:27.840> say<00:00:27.990> compared<00:00:28.349> to<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> meki

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
bit bland I'd say compared to the meki

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.290 
bit bland I'd say compared to the meki
parts<00:00:29.070> but<00:00:29.220> overall<00:00:29.550> it's<00:00:29.789> still<00:00:30.029> quite<00:00:30.269> good

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
parts but overall it's still quite good

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.179 
parts but overall it's still quite good
if<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.170> mech<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.439> wasn't<00:00:31.710> there<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> compare

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
if the mech you wasn't there to compare

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.100 
if the mech you wasn't there to compare
it<00:00:32.309> to<00:00:32.340> I'd<00:00:32.640> be<00:00:32.669> quite<00:00:32.969> happy<00:00:33.030> with<00:00:33.420> it<00:00:33.600> you've

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110

red cape is going to look a little bit

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.490 
red cape is going to look a little bit
cheesy<00:00:42.239> from<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.780> because<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.350> see

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
cheesy from the back because you can see

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.440 
cheesy from the back because you can see
where<00:00:43.680> it's<00:00:43.860> separated<00:00:44.370> there<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.149> really

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
where it's separated there but really

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.639 
where it's separated there but really
good<00:00:45.570> from<00:00:45.750> the<00:00:45.840> front<00:00:46.079> but<00:00:46.260> it's<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.620> course

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
good from the front but it's of course

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.049 
good from the front but it's of course
the<00:00:46.920> head<00:00:47.190> that's<00:00:47.309> going<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.670> all<00:00:47.820> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
the head that's going to have all the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.760 
the head that's going to have all the
most<00:00:48.210> important<00:00:48.719> parts<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.680> the

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
most important parts there with the

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.229 
most important parts there with the
color<00:00:49.920> differentiation<00:00:50.370> thanks<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.149> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
color differentiation thanks to the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.420 
color differentiation thanks to the
seals<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.870> multicolored<00:00:52.710> plastic<00:00:52.860> in

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
seals and the multicolored plastic in

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.029 
seals and the multicolored plastic in
terms<00:00:54.270> of<00:00:54.420> articulation<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> is<00:00:55.350> similar<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:56.010> a

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
terms of articulation it is similar to a

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.680 
terms of articulation it is similar to a
new<00:00:56.309> SD<00:00:56.699> so<00:00:56.879> it's<00:00:57.000> going<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.149> be<00:00:57.300> pretty<00:00:57.449> good

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
new SD so it's going to be pretty good

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.000 
new SD so it's going to be pretty good
you<00:00:57.809> can<00:00:57.840> see<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.199> action-based<00:00:58.530> is<00:00:58.800> going<00:00:58.949> to

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
you can see the action-based is going to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.500 
you can see the action-based is going to
go<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.219> there<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.850> feet<00:01:00.090> are<00:01:00.180> going<00:01:00.210> to<00:01:00.359> move

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
go in there the feet are going to move

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.970 
go in there the feet are going to move
around<00:01:00.660> on<00:01:00.899> ball<00:01:01.109> joints<00:01:01.440> but<00:01:01.530> if<00:01:01.649> you<00:01:01.739> try<00:01:01.920> to

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
around on ball joints but if you try to

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.860 
around on ball joints but if you try to
move<00:01:02.129> them<00:01:02.280> too<00:01:02.489> much<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.820> can<00:01:02.969> expect<00:01:03.300> that

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
move them too much you can expect that

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.299 
move them too much you can expect that
they're<00:01:04.019> going<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.199> fall<00:01:04.409> out<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.920> waist<00:01:05.129> is

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
they're going to fall out the waist is

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
they're going to fall out the waist is
going<00:01:05.369> to<00:01:05.519> rotate<00:01:05.700> around<00:01:05.970> here<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.510> ball

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
going to rotate around here on a ball

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.390 
going to rotate around here on a ball
joint<00:01:06.900> as<00:01:07.140> well<00:01:07.290> the<00:01:07.770> shoulders<00:01:08.159> can<00:01:08.280> go

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
joint as well the shoulders can go

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.770 
joint as well the shoulders can go
around<00:01:08.580> although<00:01:08.850> they'll<00:01:09.090> bump<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
around although they'll bump into that

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.230 
around although they'll bump into that
Cape<00:01:10.350> back<00:01:10.590> there<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> you<00:01:11.670> can<00:01:11.850> see<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
Cape back there and you can see that the

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.850 
Cape back there and you can see that the
elbows<00:01:12.570> are<00:01:12.750> going<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:13.020> give<00:01:13.170> you<00:01:13.320> a<00:01:13.350> bend<00:01:13.710> of

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
elbows are going to give you a bend of

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.640 
elbows are going to give you a bend of
about<00:01:14.450> 45<00:01:15.450> degrees<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.020> probably<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.439> much

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
about 45 degrees and probably not much

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.289 
about 45 degrees and probably not much
more<00:01:16.710> and<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.700> fists<00:01:17.939> are<00:01:18.000> going<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.180> move

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
more and the fists are going to move

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
more and the fists are going to move
around<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:19.200> head<00:01:19.380> is<00:01:19.530> on<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> double<00:01:20.009> ball

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
around the head is on a double ball

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
around the head is on a double ball
joint<00:01:20.400> so<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:20.729> going<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:20.909> have<00:01:21.030> two<00:01:21.210> points

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
joint so it's going to have two points

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.510 
joint so it's going to have two points
of<00:01:21.570> articulation<00:01:21.689> and<00:01:22.380> this<00:01:22.650> visor<00:01:22.920> once<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
of articulation and this visor once you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.420 
of articulation and this visor once you
plug<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.720> go<00:01:24.990> down<00:01:25.320> a<00:01:25.350> little<00:01:25.650> bit<00:01:25.860> with

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
plug it in can go down a little bit with

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310 
plug it in can go down a little bit with
his<00:01:26.610> armor<00:01:26.909> off<00:01:27.030> in<00:01:27.240> as<00:01:27.360> light<00:01:27.630> form<00:01:27.990> you<00:01:28.170> can

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
his armor off in as light form you can

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.569 
his armor off in as light form you can
see<00:01:28.439> that<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.650> mobility<00:01:29.070> would<00:01:29.189> increase<00:01:29.520> a

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
see that the mobility would increase a

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.859 
see that the mobility would increase a
little<00:01:29.820> bit<00:01:29.970> because<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.570> going<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.780> be

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
little bit because it's going to be

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.300 
little bit because it's going to be
unencumbered<00:01:31.229> by<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.530> armor<00:01:31.890> all<00:01:32.009> over<00:01:32.220> the

unencumbered by the armor all over the
place<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:33.119> can<00:01:33.270> see<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.600> shoulders<00:01:33.960> are

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
place you can see that the shoulders are

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.149 
place you can see that the shoulders are
going<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.200> have<00:01:34.320> those<00:01:34.470> nice<00:01:34.680> poly<00:01:34.920> cap

looking part there on the head and on
the<00:01:41.939> shoulders<00:01:42.270> you<00:01:42.299> could<00:01:42.509> put<00:01:42.659> some<00:01:42.810> inking

the shoulders you could put some inking
in<00:01:43.229> there<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:43.890> then<00:01:44.009> again<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.369> going<00:01:44.460> to

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
in there but then again it's going to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.679 
in there but then again it's going to
get<00:01:44.640> covered<00:01:44.970> up<00:01:45.060> unless<00:01:45.240> you're<00:01:45.509> going<00:01:45.630> to

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
is going to look really great because

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.050

parts<00:02:32.200> here<00:02:32.380> a<00:02:32.500> little<00:02:32.890> bit<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.130> lining<00:02:33.400> there

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
parts here a little bit of lining there

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.280 
parts here a little bit of lining there
and<00:02:33.790> a<00:02:33.880> camera<00:02:34.150> lens<00:02:34.330> on<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.600> back<00:02:34.750> but

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
and a camera lens on the back but

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:36.870 
and a camera lens on the back but
overall<00:02:35.590> this<00:02:35.980> right<00:02:36.280> there<00:02:36.520> is<00:02:36.550> I<00:02:36.820> think

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
overall this right there is I think

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.520 
overall this right there is I think
worth<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.390> price<00:02:37.540> of<00:02:37.720> admission<00:02:37.810> alone<00:02:38.140> I'd

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
worth the price of admission alone I'd

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.710 
worth the price of admission alone I'd
say<00:02:38.770> and<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.700> other<00:02:39.730> noticeable<00:02:40.240> parts<00:02:40.600> have

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:40.720 
say and the other noticeable parts have

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:41.970 
say and the other noticeable parts have
to<00:02:40.750> be<00:02:40.930> these<00:02:41.050> front<00:02:41.350> armors<00:02:41.680> where<00:02:41.860> they're

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
to be these front armors where they're

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.900 
to be these front armors where they're
going<00:02:42.100> to<00:02:42.160> bother<00:02:42.310> to<00:02:42.459> give<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.790> the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
going to bother to give you the

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.550 
going to bother to give you the
articulation<00:02:43.600> and<00:02:43.690> again<00:02:43.959> because<00:02:44.290> it's<00:02:44.440> got

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
articulation and again because it's got

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.870 
articulation and again because it's got
that<00:02:44.680> perforation<00:02:45.160> there<00:02:45.459> it's<00:02:45.640> just<00:02:45.790> going

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
that perforation there it's just going

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:47.820 
that perforation there it's just going
to<00:02:45.940> add<00:02:46.150> not<00:02:46.600> the<00:02:46.780> illusion<00:02:47.170> of<00:02:47.290> another<00:02:47.560> color

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
to add not the illusion of another color

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.470 
to add not the illusion of another color
there<00:02:48.130> even<00:02:48.850> though<00:02:48.940> they<00:02:49.060> don't<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.270> to

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
there even though they don't have to

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:52.110 
there even though they don't have to
give<00:02:49.600> you<00:02:49.720> more<00:02:49.900> plastic<00:02:50.550> his<00:02:51.550> Thor<00:02:51.910> light

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
give you more plastic his Thor light

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.460 
give you more plastic his Thor light
cape<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.630> going<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> have<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.020> nice<00:02:53.230> little

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
cape is going to have a nice little

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.050 
cape is going to have a nice little
connection<00:02:53.739> point<00:02:54.160> there's<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.640> just<00:02:54.880> got

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
connection point there's it's just got

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.160 
connection point there's it's just got
three<00:02:55.330> little<00:02:55.510> pigs<00:02:55.750> that<00:02:55.870> are<00:02:55.930> going<00:02:56.110> to

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
three little pigs that are going to

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:57.990 
three little pigs that are going to
stick<00:02:56.410> out<00:02:56.590> and<00:02:56.890> then<00:02:57.070> this<00:02:57.280> will<00:02:57.489> just<00:02:57.730> slide

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
stick out and then this will just slide

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.060 
stick out and then this will just slide
on<00:02:58.360> and<00:02:58.660> what<00:02:59.200> that's<00:02:59.410> going<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.620> allow<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.920> to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
on and what that's going to allow you to

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.100 
on and what that's going to allow you to
do<00:03:00.190> is<00:03:00.340> to<00:03:00.459> bring<00:03:00.640> this<00:03:00.850> up<00:03:01.090> and<00:03:01.420> because<00:03:01.959> it's

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
do is to bring this up and because it's

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.020 
do is to bring this up and because it's
just<00:03:02.260> on<00:03:02.440> poly<00:03:02.650> caps<00:03:02.950> there<00:03:03.220> these<00:03:03.760> are<00:03:03.940> going

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
just on poly caps there these are going

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.400 
just on poly caps there these are going
to<00:03:04.120> rotate<00:03:04.450> off<00:03:04.570> to<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> side<00:03:05.050> so<00:03:05.230> you<00:03:05.260> can

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
to rotate off to the side so you can

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.170 
to rotate off to the side so you can
have<00:03:05.620> them<00:03:05.739> sort<00:03:05.980> of<00:03:06.040> dynamically<00:03:06.580> twisting

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
have them sort of dynamically twisting

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.820 
have them sort of dynamically twisting
this<00:03:07.330> way<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.780> they<00:03:08.290> say<00:03:08.500> that<00:03:08.709> these

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:08.830 
this way and they say that these

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:10.350 
this way and they say that these
individual<00:03:09.400> parts<00:03:09.640> can<00:03:09.790> move<00:03:09.940> up<00:03:10.090> but<00:03:10.239> they

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
individual parts can move up but they

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.910 
individual parts can move up but they
can't<00:03:10.660> really<00:03:10.900> if<00:03:11.140> you<00:03:11.260> try<00:03:11.410> to<00:03:11.470> do<00:03:11.620> too<00:03:11.800> much

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
can't really if you try to do too much

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.560 
can't really if you try to do too much
with<00:03:12.100> them<00:03:12.280> they're<00:03:12.820> just<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.239> pop<00:03:13.420> off

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
with them they're just going to pop off

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.270 
with them they're just going to pop off
the<00:03:13.750> poly<00:03:13.959> cap<00:03:14.200> but<00:03:14.380> still<00:03:14.620> overall<00:03:14.950> the<00:03:15.100> fact

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
the poly cap but still overall the fact

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.550 
the poly cap but still overall the fact
that<00:03:15.340> they<00:03:15.520> open<00:03:15.940> is<00:03:16.180> pretty<00:03:16.870> impressive<00:03:17.140> by

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:17.560 
that they open is pretty impressive by

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.630 
that they open is pretty impressive by
itself<00:03:19.590> fully<00:03:20.590> armed<00:03:20.980> I'd<00:03:21.100> say<00:03:21.220> that<00:03:21.370> this<00:03:21.459> guy

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:21.640 
itself fully armed I'd say that this guy

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.890 
itself fully armed I'd say that this guy
is<00:03:21.700> going<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:21.880> look<00:03:21.940> really<00:03:22.060> impressive

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
is going to look really impressive

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.449 
is going to look really impressive
because<00:03:23.080> the<00:03:23.410> shield<00:03:23.709> colors<00:03:24.130> are<00:03:24.280> going<00:03:24.370> to

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
because the shield colors are going to

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.220 
because the shield colors are going to
match<00:03:24.580> the<00:03:24.760> helmet<00:03:25.060> colors<00:03:25.360> you<00:03:25.959> can<00:03:26.080> even

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
match the helmet colors you can even

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:27.630 
match the helmet colors you can even
take<00:03:26.470> the<00:03:26.590> spear<00:03:26.860> and<00:03:26.950> put<00:03:27.130> that<00:03:27.280> on<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.549> the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
take the spear and put that on to the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.949 
take the spear and put that on to the
back<00:03:27.790> there<00:03:28.030> with<00:03:28.150> that<00:03:28.269> attachment<00:03:28.540> point

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
back there with that attachment point

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:29.970 
back there with that attachment point
which<00:03:29.110> you'll<00:03:29.260> remove<00:03:29.709> for<00:03:29.920> the

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:29.980 
which you'll remove for the

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:31.259 
which you'll remove for the
transformation<00:03:30.580> as<00:03:30.700> you'll<00:03:30.850> see<00:03:31.000> in<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.120> moment

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
transformation as you'll see in a moment

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:33.509 
transformation as you'll see in a moment
and<00:03:31.840> outside<00:03:32.350> of<00:03:32.380> the<00:03:32.560> outward<00:03:32.920> grasp<00:03:33.250> with

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
and outside of the outward grasp with

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.680 
and outside of the outward grasp with
the<00:03:33.640> shield<00:03:33.850> there<00:03:34.030> I'd<00:03:34.150> say<00:03:34.299> everything

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
the shield there I'd say everything

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.420 
the shield there I'd say everything
about<00:03:34.930> this<00:03:35.140> guy<00:03:35.350> looks<00:03:35.620> really<00:03:35.709> cool<00:03:36.160> when

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
about this guy looks really cool when

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.589 
about this guy looks really cool when
he's<00:03:36.549> armed

00:03:43.589 --> 00:03:43.599 

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:46.270 

for<00:03:44.599> comparison<00:03:45.080> time<00:03:45.260> here<00:03:45.530> it<00:03:45.650> is<00:03:45.770> next<00:03:46.160> to

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
for comparison time here it is next to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.390 
for comparison time here it is next to
the<00:03:46.400> not-so-old<00:03:47.110> rx-78<00:03:48.110> -<00:03:48.590> this<00:03:48.950> is<00:03:49.130> for<00:03:49.310> the

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:49.400 
the not-so-old rx-78 - this is for the

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.979 
the not-so-old rx-78 - this is for the
30th<00:03:49.760> anniversary<00:03:49.910> here<00:03:50.569> although<00:03:50.810> I<00:03:50.840> believe

00:03:50.979 --> 00:03:50.989 
30th anniversary here although I believe

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:53.380 
30th anniversary here although I believe
it's<00:03:51.349> built<00:03:51.560> based<00:03:51.920> on<00:03:52.069> an<00:03:52.160> earlier<00:03:52.400> mold<00:03:52.700> but

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
it's built based on an earlier mold but

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:54.699 
it's built based on an earlier mold but
you<00:03:53.480> can<00:03:53.599> see<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:53.870> the<00:03:53.959> night<00:03:54.110> is<00:03:54.290> should<00:03:54.560> be

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
you can see that the night is should be

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:55.990 
you can see that the night is should be
a<00:03:54.739> little<00:03:54.950> bit<00:03:55.069> taller<00:03:55.250> because<00:03:55.520> of<00:03:55.760> the<00:03:55.819> fact

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
a little bit taller because of the fact

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.449 
a little bit taller because of the fact
that<00:03:56.060> he<00:03:56.209> actually<00:03:56.330> has<00:03:56.780> legs<00:03:57.250> however<00:03:58.250> it's

just<00:04:18.950> a<00:04:19.070> little<00:04:19.100> bit<00:04:19.519> better<00:04:19.700> in<00:04:19.910> terms<00:04:20.120> of

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
just a little bit better in terms of

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.480 
just a little bit better in terms of
size<00:04:20.600> there<00:04:20.989> although<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.829> knight<00:04:22.010> again<00:04:22.220> is

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
size there although the knight again is

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:23.800 
size there although the knight again is
going<00:04:22.610> to<00:04:22.669> have<00:04:22.850> all<00:04:23.000> those<00:04:23.150> colors<00:04:23.510> there<00:04:23.780> and

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
going to have all those colors there and

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.450 
going to have all those colors there and
I'd<00:04:24.020> say<00:04:24.200> you'd<00:04:24.350> stack<00:04:24.590> up<00:04:24.770> with<00:04:24.919> any<00:04:25.070> modern

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460

I'd say you'd stack up with any modern

SD to turn this guy into his horse boat

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.469 
SD to turn this guy into his horse boat
you're<00:04:28.280> just<00:04:28.460> going<00:04:28.610> to<00:04:28.669> pop<00:04:28.850> off<00:04:29.060> the<00:04:29.270> feet

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
you're just going to pop off the feet

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.150 
you're just going to pop off the feet
and<00:04:29.720> take<00:04:29.870> these<00:04:30.110> parts<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.650> attach<00:04:30.889> on<00:04:31.130> the

and take these parts and attach on the
hooves<00:04:31.460> and<00:04:31.729> then<00:04:32.210> you're<00:04:32.300> also<00:04:32.419> going<00:04:32.540> to

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
hooves and then you're also going to

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.210 
hooves and then you're also going to
have<00:04:32.840> this<00:04:33.020> whole<00:04:33.260> part<00:04:33.500> back<00:04:33.650> here<00:04:33.919> which<00:04:34.070> is

have this whole part back here which is

have this whole part back here which is
actually<00:04:34.340> going<00:04:34.580> to<00:04:34.669> have<00:04:34.760> a<00:04:34.790> surprising

amount of mobility and plug it into the

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.430 
amount of mobility and plug it into the

back and while Bibi Senshi has had some

back and while Bibi Senshi has had some
ridiculous<00:04:40.010> stuff<00:04:40.220> over<00:04:40.460> the<00:04:40.550> years<00:04:40.700> I<00:04:40.880> think

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
ridiculous stuff over the years I think

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:42.520 
ridiculous stuff over the years I think
this<00:04:41.210> has<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.419> be<00:04:41.630> right<00:04:41.870> up<00:04:42.080> there<00:04:42.110> with<00:04:42.410> the

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
this has to be right up there with the

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.110 
this has to be right up there with the
best<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.830> them<00:04:42.950> you're<00:04:43.580> going<00:04:43.669> to<00:04:43.760> have<00:04:43.910> be

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.120 
best of them you're going to have be

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.520 
best of them you're going to have be
able<00:04:44.330> to<00:04:44.389> move<00:04:44.570> the<00:04:44.720> tail<00:04:44.900> back<00:04:45.110> there<00:04:45.350> and<00:04:45.440> you

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
able to move the tail back there and you

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.870 
able to move the tail back there and you
could<00:04:45.650> actually<00:04:45.770> swivel<00:04:46.340> these<00:04:46.460> parts<00:04:46.760> and

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
could actually swivel these parts and

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.550 
could actually swivel these parts and
move<00:04:47.270> the<00:04:47.419> legs<00:04:47.600> around<00:04:47.900> so<00:04:48.050> almost<00:04:48.320> better

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:48.560 
move the legs around so almost better

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.529 
move the legs around so almost better
than<00:04:48.620> phoom<00:04:48.950> psyche<00:04:49.400> there<00:04:49.550> the<00:04:50.150> upper<00:04:50.270> body

00:04:50.529 --> 00:04:50.539 
than phoom psyche there the upper body

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.029 
than phoom psyche there the upper body
isn't<00:04:50.840> going<00:04:50.960> to<00:04:51.020> be<00:04:51.140> affected<00:04:51.560> at<00:04:51.650> all<00:04:51.740> and

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
isn't going to be affected at all and

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:53.260 
isn't going to be affected at all and
you<00:04:52.250> are<00:04:52.370> going<00:04:52.490> to<00:04:52.580> add<00:04:52.640> a<00:04:52.669> little<00:04:52.910> bit<00:04:53.000> more

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:53.270 
you are going to add a little bit more

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:54.520 
you are going to add a little bit more
height<00:04:53.510> there<00:04:53.780> because<00:04:54.050> you're<00:04:54.169> adding<00:04:54.440> on

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
height there because you're adding on

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:56.380 
height there because you're adding on
those<00:04:54.770> hooves<00:04:55.640> instead<00:04:56.180> of<00:04:56.270> those<00:04:56.330> little

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:56.390 
those hooves instead of those little

00:04:56.390 --> 00:04:58.360 
those hooves instead of those little
flat<00:04:56.810> feet<00:04:57.080> there<00:04:57.350> so<00:04:57.890> overall<00:04:58.100> it's

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
flat feet there so overall it's

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.010 
flat feet there so overall it's
something<00:04:58.640> that<00:04:58.789> is<00:04:58.910> a<00:04:58.940> little<00:04:59.330> bit<00:04:59.539> fun<00:04:59.780> but

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:00.020 
something that is a little bit fun but

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:01.390 
something that is a little bit fun but
again<00:05:00.229> I<00:05:00.260> don't<00:05:00.440> know<00:05:00.590> how<00:05:00.650> often<00:05:01.130> you<00:05:01.220> do<00:05:01.370> it

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
again I don't know how often you do it

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.219 
again I don't know how often you do it
and<00:05:01.640> probably<00:05:02.030> not<00:05:02.180> worth<00:05:02.360> buying<00:05:02.930> another

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:03.229 
and probably not worth buying another

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.230 
and probably not worth buying another
one<00:05:03.320> just<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.160> show<00:05:04.340> them<00:05:04.490> off<00:05:04.610> in<00:05:04.789> both<00:05:04.970> modes

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
one just to show them off in both modes

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:07.450 
one just to show them off in both modes
I'd<00:05:05.479> imagine<00:05:05.930> and<00:05:06.110> for<00:05:06.680> comparison<00:05:06.979> I'd

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
I'd imagine and for comparison I'd

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:09.610 
I'd imagine and for comparison I'd
imagine<00:05:07.880> that<00:05:07.910> phoon<00:05:08.240> psyche<00:05:08.750> is<00:05:08.900> the<00:05:09.080> only

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:09.620 
imagine that phoon psyche is the only

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:11.800 
imagine that phoon psyche is the only
one<00:05:09.830> who's<00:05:10.070> appropriate<00:05:10.729> again<00:05:11.510> that<00:05:11.690> this

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
one who's appropriate again that this

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:13.330 
one who's appropriate again that this
guy<00:05:11.990> just<00:05:12.229> doesn't<00:05:12.350> have<00:05:12.620> all<00:05:12.740> that<00:05:12.889> much<00:05:13.100> leg

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
guy just doesn't have all that much leg

you've got tons of playability between
his<00:05:42.530> leg<00:05:42.740> forms<00:05:43.160> swapping<00:05:43.610> this<00:05:43.760> off<00:05:43.970> the<00:05:44.150> back

and that silly Ken Taurus form which is

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:48.279 
and that silly Ken Taurus form which is
actually<00:05:46.970> a<00:05:47.000> surprising<00:05:47.720> but<00:05:47.870> it's<00:05:48.080> going<00:05:48.229> to

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:48.289 
actually a surprising but it's going to

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.390 
actually a surprising but it's going to
look<00:05:48.380> better<00:05:48.680> than<00:05:48.889> you'd<00:05:49.010> think

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:49.400 
look better than you'd think

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:51.670 
look better than you'd think
so<00:05:49.940> overall<00:05:50.240> tons<00:05:50.660> of<00:05:50.810> playability<00:05:51.139> tons<00:05:51.560> of

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:51.680 
so overall tons of playability tons of

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.930 
so overall tons of playability tons of
options<00:05:52.099> and

options and

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:53.980 
options and
even<00:05:53.210> though<00:05:53.300> you're<00:05:53.450> not<00:05:53.510> going<00:05:53.570> to<00:05:53.750> get<00:05:53.810> all

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:53.990 
even though you're not going to get all

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:56.050 
even though you're not going to get all
that<00:05:54.020> much<00:05:54.350> poseability<00:05:54.830> I'd<00:05:55.580> say<00:05:55.820> with<00:05:55.970> the

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
that much poseability I'd say with the

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.790 
that much poseability I'd say with the
weapons<00:05:56.360> and<00:05:56.480> hands<00:05:56.660> other<00:05:56.930> other<00:05:57.530> than

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
weapons and hands other other than

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.140 
weapons and hands other other than
having<00:05:58.130> them<00:05:58.250> pointing<00:05:58.640> one<00:05:58.790> way<00:05:58.940> or<00:05:59.090> the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
having them pointing one way or the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:01.060 
having them pointing one way or the
other<00:05:59.210> it's<00:05:59.960> still<00:06:00.290> a<00:06:00.320> lot<00:06:00.530> of<00:06:00.560> fun<00:06:00.800> and<00:06:00.920> it's

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
other it's still a lot of fun and it's

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.110 
other it's still a lot of fun and it's
helped<00:06:01.310> by<00:06:01.370> the<00:06:01.430> fact<00:06:01.610> that<00:06:01.820> you<00:06:01.880> have<00:06:01.970> those

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:02.120 
helped by the fact that you have those

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.030 
helped by the fact that you have those
easy<00:06:02.540> I<00:06:02.660> swap<00:06:03.110> so<00:06:03.290> you<00:06:03.380> don't<00:06:03.530> have<00:06:03.650> that<00:06:03.710> same

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:04.040 
easy I swap so you don't have that same

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:05.740 
easy I swap so you don't have that same
dilemma<00:06:04.220> that<00:06:04.610> I've<00:06:04.700> had<00:06:04.850> with<00:06:05.000> the<00:06:05.120> h1<00:06:05.480> and<00:06:05.630> h2
