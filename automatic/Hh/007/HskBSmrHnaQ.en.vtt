00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.480 
Kevin Volland card on fifa ultimate team
these<00:00:15.929> are<00:00:16.109> accurate<00:00:16.560> stats<00:00:16.859> compared

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
these are accurate stats compared

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.970 
these are accurate stats compared
everything<00:00:17.970> it<00:00:18.090> looks<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.449> same<00:00:18.980> haven't

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
everything it looks the same haven't

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.170 
everything it looks the same haven't
obviously<00:00:20.039> played<00:00:20.490> with<00:00:20.609> him<00:00:20.699> in<00:00:20.789> game<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.119> I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
obviously played with him in game so I

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:22.790 
obviously played with him in game so I
can't<00:00:21.420> look<00:00:21.539> at<00:00:21.720> these<00:00:21.840> other<00:00:22.199> steps<00:00:22.560> that<00:00:22.650> are

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
can't look at these other steps that are

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
can't look at these other steps that are
in<00:00:22.920> his<00:00:23.010> car<00:00:23.279> but<00:00:23.519> everything<00:00:23.789> matches<00:00:24.119> on<00:00:24.240> the

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
in his car but everything matches on the

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.660 
in his car but everything matches on the
card<00:00:24.570> so<00:00:24.779> I'd<00:00:24.900> assume<00:00:25.260> everything<00:00:25.740> matches<00:00:26.279> in

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
card so I'd assume everything matches in

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.450 
card so I'd assume everything matches in
his<00:00:26.939> other<00:00:27.119> stats<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.689> can't<00:00:27.930> see<00:00:28.460> the

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
his other stats that you can't see the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.740 
his other stats that you can't see the

balanced<00:01:20.009> stats<00:01:20.750> obviously<00:01:21.750> his<00:01:21.960> defensive

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
balanced stats obviously his defensive

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.200 
balanced stats obviously his defensive
stats<00:01:22.770> aren't<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.220> best<00:01:23.460> but<00:01:23.850> I<00:01:24.000> mean

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
stats aren't the best but I mean

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.940 
stats aren't the best but I mean
especially<00:01:24.600> for<00:01:24.990> a<00:01:25.049> striker<00:01:25.320> it's<00:01:25.530> not<00:01:25.710> that

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
especially for a striker it's not that

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.510 
especially for a striker it's not that
bad<00:01:26.220> considering<00:01:27.979> just<00:01:28.979> want<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.220> run<00:01:29.369> over

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
bad considering just want to run over

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.819 
bad considering just want to run over
some<00:01:29.759> of<00:01:29.850> his<00:01:29.970> key<00:01:30.240> stats<00:01:30.570> he<00:01:30.720> has<00:01:30.750> 90<00:01:31.290> stamina

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
some of his key stats he has 90 stamina

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.289 
some of his key stats he has 90 stamina
which<00:01:31.979> means<00:01:32.159> he's<00:01:32.340> not<00:01:32.610> going<00:01:32.850> to<00:01:32.909> get<00:01:33.030> tired

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
which means he's not going to get tired

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.120 
which means he's not going to get tired
very<00:01:33.600> easily<00:01:33.780> going<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.290> be<00:01:34.409> able<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.799> play<00:01:34.920> him

but against a defense so probably

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.670 
but against a defense so probably
that'll<00:01:54.750> probably<00:01:54.960> be<00:01:55.079> more<00:01:55.380> than<00:01:55.560> enough

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680

he's got 87 balance which means it's

about that he has 78 strength which is

fastest but 79 sprint speed is pretty

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.790
