00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 hi girls how are you welcome to the 

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.400
 channel today I'm going to teach you how to do the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.730
 profiling of the face with this palette of 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.450
 citi color which is the control of fex and 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.330
 comes from in this presentation 

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.150
 brings three shades that are bronzer the 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.070
 control and the illuminator in the part of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.460
 above it brings like that instructions 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.620
 to use it and I'm going to teach you 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.410
 the way that I do it so that it 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:36.900
 look much more polished the face that is not 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.360
 see how very flat and apart so that 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.840
 look like a little more professional 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.989
 in my way of seeing it and I'm going to start with 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.450
 make the profiling of my face that is 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.760
 suited to my type of face that is 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.340
 round that you have the face of another 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.610
 way I advise you to see how 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.770
 you have your morphology of your face and 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.290
 you can orient yourself with some images 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.970
 google and there look for what kind of 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.910
 face you have to do the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.060
 corrections and first 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:11.009
 I start by applying the browser in this 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:14.190
 palette you have to take very little 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.350
 amount because it's always better than 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.070
 less to more so that it does not look like that 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.659
 the tuning rayon of your face and what 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.649
 what I do is 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.050
 I start to draw the line of my cheek 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:32.810
 here where you see the sinking 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.810
 and I start to mark very subtly 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.700
 It should be noted that I already put 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.159
 which is the base and the proofreader and now 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.909
 I only make the outline with the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.359
 dust that took that part and also here 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:50.359
 in the chin 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:02:00.189
 Now what follows is to take the tone of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:03.280
 control that also very little nothing 

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:06.490
 more to be able to mark the line what 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.769
 do is put on place where 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.810
 but only by dialing the line now 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.810
 yes and sweeping it down 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.470
 what I am doing is a gradualism 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.780
 between the two tones because many times 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.510
 they start by putting control first 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.790
 and then it 's dancer if it's going to help you 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.730
 blur but you will take much longer 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.670
 so as I say, it's from less to more 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.580
 and doing as if it were a shadow one 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.410
 degraded shadow put a lighter shade 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.190
 then more no more dark then another more 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.960
 much darker than the medium tone and 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.640
 I start to mark 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:54.700
 as you see it looked like degraded 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:57.370
 and everything and as a complement to what is the 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.050
 counter they need what a blog is and I 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.000
 I use this also from the brand the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.140
 city â€‹â€‹color that I really like that is the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.990
 black berry tone 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.260
 now I have to place it and I take very 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:11.680
 little quantity and the center here in the 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:13.970
 cheek in what is the cheekbone doing 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.700
 an elongation 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.200
 and integrating the three things and already 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.850
 last I have to put what is the 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.610
 illuminator and that I do with a skunk 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:31.040
 and that placed him in what is above 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:32.840
 where was the deadline and I'm going 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.020
 distributing what I'm blurring 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:38.290
 You can do it with your finger and 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:42.120
 it looks like 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:44.469
 now all this is very marked and 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.840
 doing it more subtly if left 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:50.140
 very marked and I what I do so that 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.290
 last all day is used up what 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:55.629
 that makes the dust seal it with what it is 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.970
 a powder and I'm using this one 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:02.850
 vissum 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:06.710
 and I'm going to seal everything I put 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.710
 and the entire base at one time 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.650
 and so it remains 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:16.079
 Do not think that you are going to hide everything 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.269
 it's nothing else for what is that and if they want 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.850
 highlight a little bit more the blog because what 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:24.600
 can do but that's it 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:28.850
 counter and as you see here I do not have 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.850
 nothing and here I have the culture 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:34.220
 and as you see, you can not see the face 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.710
 flat without any shadow without 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:40.370
 no blushing and well with this already 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.450
 we see ourselves a little bit more polished in that 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.070
 appearance 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:46.280
 many nothing else are put on the blog without 

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.920
 iva ' bay but I bring you this this 

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.660
 way I do it and well I hope
