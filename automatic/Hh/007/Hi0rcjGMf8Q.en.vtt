00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
active this is what our teachers have

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.779 
active this is what our teachers have
been<00:00:27.180> looking<00:00:27.539> for<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:28.130> enormous<00:00:29.130> burden<00:00:29.429> on

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:29.789 
been looking for the enormous burden on

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:31.820 
been looking for the enormous burden on
a<00:00:29.820> teacher<00:00:30.150> to<00:00:30.510> make<00:00:30.960> all<00:00:31.230> of<00:00:31.289> that<00:00:31.590> happen

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
a teacher to make all of that happen

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.370 
a teacher to make all of that happen
without<00:00:32.489> a<00:00:32.640> framework<00:00:32.969> has<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:34.200> been

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
without a framework has really been

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.770 
without a framework has really been
lifted<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.980> so<00:00:35.190> many<00:00:35.280> ways<00:00:35.520> five<00:00:36.000> we<00:00:36.360> do<00:00:36.540> they

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
lifted in so many ways five we do they

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.810 
lifted in so many ways five we do they
have<00:00:36.989> seen<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.620> opportunity<00:00:37.980> to<00:00:38.460> get<00:00:38.640> their

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
have seen the opportunity to get their

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.970 
have seen the opportunity to get their
kids<00:00:39.059> engaged<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.930> fully<00:00:40.290> integrated

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
kids engaged in a fully integrated

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.920 
kids engaged in a fully integrated
system<00:00:41.160> in<00:00:42.000> ways<00:00:42.300> that<00:00:42.450> I<00:00:42.510> don't<00:00:42.570> think<00:00:42.840> they

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
system in ways that I don't think they

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:55.910 
system in ways that I don't think they
imagined

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.920 

we<00:00:56.920> do<00:00:57.100> robotics<00:00:57.520> allows<00:00:58.270> me<00:00:58.480> to<00:00:58.540> teach<00:00:58.660> math

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
we do robotics allows me to teach math

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.440 
we do robotics allows me to teach math
in<00:00:59.230> a<00:00:59.290> new<00:00:59.500> way<00:00:59.710> we're<00:01:00.280> able<00:01:00.400> to<00:01:00.670> use<00:01:00.910> just

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:01.450 
in a new way we're able to use just

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.479 
in a new way we're able to use just
basically<00:01:01.809> you<00:01:02.200> know<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.500> bricks<00:01:02.770> to<00:01:03.250> teach

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
basically you know the bricks to teach

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:05.310 
basically you know the bricks to teach
multiplication<00:01:03.970> some<00:01:04.629> of<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:04.809> bricks<00:01:05.019> are<00:01:05.260> a

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
multiplication some of the bricks are a

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.469 
multiplication some of the bricks are a
two<00:01:05.770> by<00:01:06.010> six<00:01:06.040> and<00:01:06.580> there's<00:01:06.700> 12<00:01:06.970> dots<00:01:07.210> on<00:01:07.450> that

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:07.479 
two by six and there's 12 dots on that

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.750 
two by six and there's 12 dots on that
so<00:01:07.840> that's<00:01:08.020> teaching<00:01:08.229> arrays<00:01:08.650> we<00:01:09.310> used<00:01:09.580> it<00:01:09.729> to

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
so that's teaching arrays we used it to

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.250 
so that's teaching arrays we used it to
teach<00:01:10.000> fractions<00:01:10.300> we've<00:01:10.810> used<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.229> for

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:11.260 
teach fractions we've used it for

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.560 
teach fractions we've used it for
subtraction<00:01:12.160> in<00:01:12.400> addition<00:01:12.880> we've<00:01:13.119> used<00:01:13.390> the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570 
subtraction in addition we've used the

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.160 
subtraction in addition we've used the
software<00:01:13.960> for<00:01:14.500> timing<00:01:15.600> counting<00:01:16.600> we've<00:01:16.930> used

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
software for timing counting we've used

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.140 
software for timing counting we've used
it<00:01:17.320> for<00:01:17.590> all<00:01:18.040> different<00:01:18.100> kinds<00:01:18.430> of<00:01:18.700> things<00:01:18.910> and

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
it for all different kinds of things and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.359 
it for all different kinds of things and
it<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.510> is<00:01:19.690> a<00:01:19.869> new<00:01:20.229> way<00:01:20.560> and<00:01:20.800> a<00:01:20.890> different<00:01:21.250> way

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
it just is a new way and a different way

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.070 
it just is a new way and a different way
to<00:01:21.430> for<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.150> students<00:01:22.450> to<00:01:22.540> practice<00:01:22.690> the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.080 
to for the students to practice the

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.410 
to for the students to practice the
skills<00:01:23.350> that<00:01:23.440> they're<00:01:23.649> learning<00:01:24.060> my<00:01:25.060> favorite

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
skills that they're learning my favorite

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.469 
skills that they're learning my favorite
thing<00:01:25.630> about<00:01:25.660> the<00:01:26.110> we<00:01:26.350> do<00:01:26.649> is<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.820> instead<00:01:28.149> of

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
thing about the we do is that instead of

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.680 
thing about the we do is that instead of
just<00:01:28.600> using<00:01:28.960> um<00:01:29.470> paper<00:01:30.070> and<00:01:30.640> pencil<00:01:31.180> for<00:01:31.390> doing

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
just using um paper and pencil for doing

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.350 
just using um paper and pencil for doing
math<00:01:31.930> you<00:01:32.680> get<00:01:32.860> to<00:01:33.040> use<00:01:33.220> different<00:01:33.580> kinds<00:01:34.060> of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
math you get to use different kinds of

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.090 
math you get to use different kinds of
bricks<00:01:34.869> and<00:01:35.140> blocks<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:36.190> just<00:01:36.490> make<00:01:37.149> math<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
bricks and blocks to just make math and

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.850 
bricks and blocks to just make math and
it's<00:01:39.100> really<00:01:39.759> fun<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.240> do<00:01:40.660> our<00:01:41.200> schools<00:01:41.560> focus

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
it's really fun to do our schools focus

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.590 
it's really fun to do our schools focus
this<00:01:42.009> year<00:01:42.190> has<00:01:42.340> been<00:01:42.369> writing<00:01:42.910> today<00:01:43.210> with

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
this year has been writing today with

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.170 
this year has been writing today with
our<00:01:43.810> activity<00:01:44.470> the<00:01:44.920> students<00:01:45.430> not<00:01:45.789> only<00:01:45.820> did

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:46.180 
our activity the students not only did

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.420 
our activity the students not only did
they<00:01:46.330> do<00:01:46.390> mathematics<00:01:47.289> but<00:01:47.530> afterwards<00:01:48.160> we

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
they do mathematics but afterwards we

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.740 
they do mathematics but afterwards we
wrote<00:01:48.670> about<00:01:48.970> what<00:01:49.210> our<00:01:49.300> goals<00:01:49.539> and<00:01:49.690> our

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
wrote about what our goals and our

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.930 
wrote about what our goals and our
talents<00:01:50.289> were<00:01:50.470> and<00:01:50.830> that<00:01:51.070> had<00:01:51.220> to<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.460> with<00:01:51.640> the

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
talents were and that had to do with the

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:53.490 
talents were and that had to do with the
drumming<00:01:52.300> monkey<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:52.690> his<00:01:52.810> skills<00:01:53.140> and<00:01:53.410> how

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
drumming monkey and his skills and how

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.770 
drumming monkey and his skills and how
often<00:01:53.860> he<00:01:53.979> practiced<00:01:54.520> in<00:01:54.820> other<00:01:55.090> ways<00:01:55.420> we

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:55.780 
often he practiced in other ways we

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.510 
often he practiced in other ways we
could<00:01:55.990> you<00:01:56.260> can<00:01:56.409> innovate<00:01:56.590> science<00:01:57.100> and<00:01:57.310> math

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
could you can innovate science and math

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.679 
could you can innovate science and math
with<00:01:57.760> the<00:01:57.790> different<00:01:58.180> skills

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
with the different skills

00:01:58.689 --> 00:01:59.910 
with the different skills
I<00:01:58.840> know<00:01:59.200> later<00:01:59.500> we're<00:01:59.710> going<00:01:59.799> to<00:01:59.860> be

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
I know later we're going to be

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.070 
I know later we're going to be
integrating<00:02:00.490> music<00:02:00.909> with<00:02:01.180> pitch<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.750> sound

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:02.080 
integrating music with pitch and sound

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.560 
integrating music with pitch and sound
and<00:02:02.590> timing<00:02:03.369> and<00:02:03.640> counting<00:02:04.210> and<00:02:04.360> all<00:02:04.450> good

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
and timing and counting and all good

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:17.330 
and timing and counting and all good
things<00:02:04.630> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.860 

it's<00:02:18.340> hard<00:02:18.580> to<00:02:18.760> get<00:02:18.910> students<00:02:19.240> to<00:02:19.300> relate<00:02:19.450> to

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
it's hard to get students to relate to

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.690 
it's hard to get students to relate to
the<00:02:20.410> things<00:02:20.620> that<00:02:20.710> they<00:02:20.860> consider<00:02:21.220> happening

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
the things that they consider happening

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.550 
the things that they consider happening
a<00:02:21.880> long<00:02:22.330> time<00:02:22.540> ago<00:02:22.720> in<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.840> past<00:02:23.050> but<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.440> we

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
a long time ago in the past but the we

lesson and they remembered it
they<00:03:18.580> picked<00:03:18.850> right<00:03:19.030> back<00:03:19.180> up<00:03:19.360> on<00:03:19.480> it<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.990> boat

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
they picked right back up on it the boat

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.470 
they picked right back up on it the boat
it<00:03:20.590> was<00:03:20.860> kind<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.280> like<00:03:21.370> a<00:03:21.400> u-shape<00:03:21.940> except<00:03:22.360> a

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 
it was kind of like a u-shape except a

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:25.410 
it was kind of like a u-shape except a
little<00:03:22.630> bit<00:03:22.870> wider<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.620> so<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.100> had<00:03:24.550> to<00:03:24.580> try<00:03:25.150> and

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
little bit wider and so I had to try and

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.150 
little bit wider and so I had to try and
figure<00:03:25.630> out<00:03:25.780> and<00:03:26.200> I<00:03:26.350> looked<00:03:26.620> and<00:03:26.800> looked<00:03:26.890> and

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
figure out and I looked and looked and

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.790 
figure out and I looked and looked and
looked<00:03:27.250> until<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:27.910> found<00:03:28.180> the<00:03:28.570> right<00:03:28.810> box<00:03:29.170> put

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
looked until I found the right box put

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.130 
looked until I found the right box put
it<00:03:29.920> together<00:03:30.040> and<00:03:30.460> the<00:03:30.700> first<00:03:30.850> time<00:03:31.150> I<00:03:31.420> did<00:03:31.990> it

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
it together and the first time I did it

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.650 
it together and the first time I did it
a<00:03:32.230> bit<00:03:32.470> too<00:03:32.740> long<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:33.310> it<00:03:33.730> fell<00:03:34.090> apart<00:03:34.390> but

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
a bit too long and it fell apart but

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.690 
a bit too long and it fell apart but
then<00:03:34.780> once<00:03:34.960> I<00:03:35.080> took<00:03:35.140> slowly<00:03:35.560> walks<00:03:35.920> off<00:03:36.190> and<00:03:36.610> I

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
then once I took slowly walks off and I

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.870 
then once I took slowly walks off and I
rebuilt<00:03:37.270> it<00:03:37.450> the<00:03:37.720> parts<00:03:38.380> that<00:03:38.500> go<00:03:38.800> up<00:03:38.980> once<00:03:39.730> I

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 
rebuilt it the parts that go up once I

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.270 
rebuilt it the parts that go up once I
built<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.270> a<00:03:40.330> little<00:03:40.540> bit<00:03:40.720> smaller<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:42.070> it

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
built it a little bit smaller then it

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.890 
built it a little bit smaller then it
stayed<00:03:42.490> on<00:03:42.640> just<00:03:43.000> fine<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.630> it<00:03:43.720> worked

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
stayed on just fine and it worked

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:54.660 
stayed on just fine and it worked
perfect

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.750 

it's<00:03:55.670> easier<00:03:56.090> because<00:03:56.590> Rob<00:03:57.590> is<00:03:57.799> right<00:03:58.129> I<00:03:58.400> just

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
it's easier because Rob is right I just

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.670 
it's easier because Rob is right I just
get<00:03:59.000> distracted<00:03:59.359> but<00:03:59.810> then<00:04:00.019> when<00:04:00.290> I<00:04:00.379> do<00:04:00.439> it

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
get distracted but then when I do it

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.849 
get distracted but then when I do it
with<00:04:00.769> Legos<00:04:01.129> I<00:04:01.540> focus<00:04:02.540> my<00:04:02.689> mind<00:04:02.870> on<00:04:03.079> Legos<00:04:03.530> and

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:03.859 
with Legos I focus my mind on Legos and

00:04:03.859 --> 00:04:06.099 
with Legos I focus my mind on Legos and
I<00:04:03.980> really<00:04:04.250> write<00:04:04.400> about<00:04:04.430> that<00:04:04.840> one<00:04:05.840> of<00:04:05.870> the

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:06.109

I really write about that one of the
things<00:04:06.349> that<00:04:06.530> we<00:04:06.769> have<00:04:06.980> a<00:04:07.010> hard<00:04:07.280> time<00:04:07.609> hitting

00:04:07.869 --> 00:04:07.879 
things that we have a hard time hitting

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:10.390 
things that we have a hard time hitting
with<00:04:08.180> standards<00:04:08.780> are<00:04:09.109> those<00:04:09.530> presentation

can learn and express I built a Ghana
and<00:05:54.009> I've<00:05:54.419> built<00:05:55.419> we<00:05:55.719> build<00:05:55.930> a<00:05:56.050> habitat<00:05:56.740> in<00:05:57.069> the

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
and I've built we build a habitat in the

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:09.370 
and I've built we build a habitat in the
forest<00:05:58.080> for<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.229> trees<00:05:59.340> and<00:06:00.340> some<00:06:00.490> grades

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.430 

one<00:06:09.890> of<00:06:10.010> our<00:06:10.160> big<00:06:10.430> standards<00:06:11.030> is<00:06:11.440> about

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:12.440 
one of our big standards is about

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.660 
one of our big standards is about
habitat<00:06:13.040> and<00:06:13.520> what<00:06:14.300> about<00:06:14.660> a<00:06:14.720> habitat<00:06:15.670> helps

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:16.670 
habitat and what about a habitat helps

00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:19.510 
habitat and what about a habitat helps
an<00:06:16.820> animal<00:06:17.210> survive<00:06:17.570> there<00:06:17.930> so<00:06:18.380> it<00:06:19.160> was<00:06:19.310> really

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
an animal survive there so it was really

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.660 
an animal survive there so it was really
great<00:06:19.790> that<00:06:19.910> they<00:06:20.210> could<00:06:20.540> see<00:06:20.840> the<00:06:21.670> habitat

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:22.670 
great that they could see the habitat

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:24.520 
great that they could see the habitat
and<00:06:22.940> they<00:06:23.090> could<00:06:23.270> think<00:06:23.420> well<00:06:23.630> what<00:06:23.900> do<00:06:24.380> they

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
and they could think well what do they

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:26.140 
and they could think well what do they
need<00:06:24.710> to<00:06:24.770> survive<00:06:25.130> there<00:06:25.400> so<00:06:25.610> they've<00:06:25.790> all

00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:26.150 
need to survive there so they've all

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:28.300 
need to survive there so they've all
thought<00:06:26.930> we<00:06:27.260> should<00:06:27.440> put<00:06:27.620> some<00:06:27.770> water<00:06:27.980> in

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
thought we should put some water in

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:30.400 
thought we should put some water in
there<00:06:28.490> because<00:06:28.850> all<00:06:29.120> animals<00:06:29.600> need<00:06:29.780> water<00:06:29.810> and

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
there because all animals need water and

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.890 
there because all animals need water and
we<00:06:31.100> should<00:06:31.280> probably<00:06:31.400> have<00:06:31.790> some<00:06:31.850> food<00:06:32.360> for<00:06:32.720> it

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
we should probably have some food for it

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.360 
we should probably have some food for it
so<00:06:33.110> they<00:06:33.260> had<00:06:33.410> to<00:06:33.530> go<00:06:33.650> and<00:06:33.680> think<00:06:34.010> about<00:06:34.190> what

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:34.370 
so they had to go and think about what

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:37.380 
so they had to go and think about what
kind<00:06:34.580> of<00:06:34.640> food<00:06:34.820> does<00:06:35.030> this<00:06:35.210> animal<00:06:35.660> eat<00:06:35.930> and

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:37.390 
kind of food does this animal eat and

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.090 
kind of food does this animal eat and
basically<00:06:38.390> shelter<00:06:39.110> what<00:06:39.440> does<00:06:39.560> it<00:06:39.680> need<00:06:39.890> to

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
basically shelter what does it need to

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:41.740 
basically shelter what does it need to
survive<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:40.880> that's<00:06:40.970> one<00:06:41.360> of<00:06:41.480> the<00:06:41.600> big

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:41.750 
survive and that's one of the big

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:43.330 
survive and that's one of the big
standards<00:06:42.260> that<00:06:42.470> we<00:06:42.560> learned<00:06:42.770> about<00:06:42.860> earlier

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:43.340 
standards that we learned about earlier

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:56.140 
standards that we learned about earlier
in<00:06:43.520> the<00:06:43.640> year<00:06:53.110> if<00:06:54.110> you<00:06:54.200> do<00:06:54.560> then<00:06:55.310> you'll<00:06:55.970> be

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
in the year if you do then you'll be

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.600 
in the year if you do then you'll be
inspired<00:06:56.750> by<00:06:57.080> it<00:06:57.140> it's<00:06:57.680> very<00:06:57.950> unique<00:06:58.220> and

00:06:58.600 --> 00:06:58.610 
inspired by it it's very unique and

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.420 
inspired by it it's very unique and
creative<00:06:58.760> and<00:06:59.420> helpful<00:07:00.020> it's<00:07:00.680> limited<00:07:01.280> by<00:07:01.370> the
