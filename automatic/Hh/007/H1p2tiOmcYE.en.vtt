00:00:01.349 --> 00:00:04.140
 a drying up in spinning 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.400
 because soon, since the bay to the road also 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.590
 well everyone knows that last year 2010 brazil closed with the record 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:16.610
 again in the production of such trucks is expected not courtesy 50 thousand 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.850
 exceeded reached 171 

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.909
 expensive truck produced in Brazil and with that clear because many companies 

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:26.779
 I lack a vacancy too 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.179
 because the market is good and it promises a lot 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.179
 see other companies in europe and also 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.010
 from China 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.890
 this factory here if in Chinese trot 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.350
 You must do it, I understand. 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 is already bringing and since last year the piece angels brazil there in china 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.320
 this factory it already produces or equivalent or a little more 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.900
 of what was sold last year in Brazil only a binge with production of 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.900
 more than 180 thousand trucks have seen the size of it 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.960
 will work in Brazil detail to fit each goal 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.240
 and what is the intention 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.840
 I asked to leave now. 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.170
 intention is 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.089
 enjoy 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.109
 for the growth of the South American market especially Brazil 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.510
 based on what is already part of the South American market is present in Peru 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.210
 I was not in colombia 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.400
 a factory that is much easier with a distribution 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.600
 I know the network with innocent scenes 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.670
 started 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.530
 in the middle of last year both things would already be even that's what this is 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.729
 same is true even to exchange a project he is from 2007 where 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.130
 started all study to bring the brand with the country 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.310
 and this network actually started in August 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.910
 last year 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.670
 P 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.710
 today it was only allowed to have an idea we already have 23 dealers 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.190
 the patriot strategy and 7 to the 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.100
 end of year 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.549
 acting in the master's degree and 10 trucks in mato grosso I've already seen in para 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:00.850
 he is very docile 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.900
 It is starting with your redemption exit actually the importer 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.590
 check in curitiba 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.180
 so it is this network niche that the rally in it that began in August 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.710
 dealers so it really came out stronger by the south 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.130
 Another happy thing appears to be opening now are planned schedule and derivative roseana 

00:02:27.809 --> 00:02:30.809
 the attraction is in fact and piraporinha is seeing now 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.620
 forecasted 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.779
 in a strategy then I wanted to you that is the following 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:39.659
 but it is the bearer's own 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:43.019
 we have here an installation of 13 thousand meters 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.489
 they are not having any more up to the condition of de 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.919
 care we have here you see tooling space 

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:57.409
 what will now exist in the next few months is a second home of the 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:03.189
 importer in campinas-sp and a third importer's house in santos that yes 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.579
 bieber also that walking with faith and reason to turkey 

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:10.529
 one should see the ore part of the ore being present in the company in America 

00:03:10.529 --> 00:03:14.800
 of the south its attempt to represent merit is mainly south chile 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.269
 it's not about attacking 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:19.749
 hence it accelerated during the summer 

00:03:19.749 --> 00:03:24.760
 sr another 380 responding to the current low ceiling inherits the modest ones are bringing 

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:26.379
 here and motorization 

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.449
 is that the dog we are not bringing initially 

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:31.849
 is to expose two and six with four 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:38.959
 the two with 380 horsepower are all with high roof is unusual 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.900
 the actress of series as digital air-conditioning 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.050
 soothes her with a bunk bed 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.619
 it's the fridge 

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:49.350
 all trip computer 

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.350
 we have there autopilot 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.260
 The reverse of which the factory is producing internet volleyball hand 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:04.649
 this year 2000 but by the way already will do a lot again 

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:09.719
 echo that forecast and any intention sinotruk in brazil 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:17.620
 to act against 2010 it was a year as it was said we did not start in august 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:24.470
 so it was a very short sale period, we sold there in 2010 something 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:29.760
 around 250 units and the forecast for 2011 one thousand three hundred units 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.199
 and what can I tell you that first round 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.199
 For you, what? 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:42.059
 and that as of 2013 

00:04:42.059 --> 00:04:43.189
 so we 

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:47.099
 we will be able to set up a factory in Brazil and then start 

00:04:47.099 --> 00:04:48.999
 dry mount gave product 

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:51.529
 I'm sure it closes in the fort 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:54.389
 now just to close the person think curious 

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.130
 is something that I find interesting if in the trot in Brazil stairs and that they meet 

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:59.889
 the birth of a stuck deck 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:04.129
 the oil 6 by 2 to 1 today we so commercializing the 250 thousand 

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:07.259
 and the six per 4 200 70 thousand 

00:05:07.259 --> 00:05:12.500
 in this very competitive context if you catch the similar competitor he 

00:05:12.499 --> 00:05:15.180
 well above this value 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.410
 good to want to stop is coming a lot ahead and what you just said 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.920
 that 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.060
 the part 2 min 2013 in with this type of 2013 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:27.819
 it's ok if a factory in brazil to start producing in ckd 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:29.929
 and we continue on the road
