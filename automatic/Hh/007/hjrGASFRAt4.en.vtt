00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.340 

trying<00:00:00.329> to<00:00:00.420> be<00:00:00.510> a<00:00:00.539> wizard<00:00:00.780> I'm<00:00:01.140> kind<00:00:01.319> of

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:01.350 
trying to be a wizard I'm kind of

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.039 
trying to be a wizard I'm kind of
regretting<00:00:01.469> that<00:00:01.829> already<00:00:02.870> it's<00:00:03.870> still<00:00:03.990> early

00:00:04.039 --> 00:00:04.049 
regretting that already it's still early

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:05.920 
regretting that already it's still early
enough<00:00:04.290> in<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.560> game<00:00:04.620> that<00:00:04.770> I<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.100> switch<00:00:05.370> but

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:05.930 
enough in the game that I can switch but

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.080 
enough in the game that I can switch but
because<00:00:06.930> it<00:00:07.049> feels<00:00:07.259> like<00:00:07.529> four<00:00:08.519> fights<00:00:08.790> all<00:00:09.059> I

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
around in your human flamethrower and

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.640 
around in your human flamethrower and
I'm<00:00:29.609> like<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.060> isn't<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.720> exciting<00:00:31.619> for

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
I'm like this isn't really exciting for

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.910 
I'm like this isn't really exciting for
me<00:00:33.110> you<00:00:34.110> know<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.500> can<00:00:34.620> design<00:00:34.860> your

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
me you know you can design your

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.470 
me you know you can design your
character<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> know<00:00:35.489> what<00:00:35.610> you<00:00:35.700> want<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.390> I'm

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
character I know what you want but I'm

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.700 
character I know what you want but I'm
guessing<00:00:36.660> most<00:00:36.989> people<00:00:37.380> are<00:00:37.469> going<00:00:37.559> to<00:00:37.649> be

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
guessing most people are going to be

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.170 
guessing most people are going to be
doing<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.129> way<00:00:38.160> most<00:00:38.670> people<00:00:38.790> like

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
doing it that way most people like

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.229 
doing it that way most people like
because<00:00:39.360> magic<00:00:39.629> is<00:00:40.250> it's<00:00:41.250> easier<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.000> more

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
because magic is it's easier and more

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.389 
because magic is it's easier and more
powerful<00:00:42.540> so<00:00:43.379> in<00:00:43.530> fights<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> it's<00:00:44.160> in<00:00:44.280> it

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
powerful so in fights and it's in it

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
powerful so in fights and it's in it
looks<00:00:44.550> cool<00:00:44.730> or<00:00:44.940> two<00:00:45.090> you<00:00:45.329> know<00:00:45.420> you<00:00:45.480> don't<00:00:45.750> do

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
looks cool or two you know you don't do

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.860 
looks cool or two you know you don't do
like<00:00:47.149> I'm<00:00:48.149> thinking<00:00:48.450> maybe<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.660> should<00:00:48.719> just

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
like I'm thinking maybe I should just

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.279 
like I'm thinking maybe I should just
ditch<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.260> magic<00:00:49.739> though<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.160> focus<00:00:50.489> on

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:51.289 
ditch the magic though and just focus on

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:53.779 
ditch the magic though and just focus on
weapons<00:00:52.289> because<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> way<00:00:52.680> at<00:00:53.070> least<00:00:53.340> I<00:00:53.640> get

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
weapons because that way at least I get

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.709 
weapons because that way at least I get
to<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.030> Perry<00:00:54.390> and<00:00:55.520> use<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.670> shield<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.300> /

to like Perry and use my shield and /

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.680

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.520 
ducks behind something and then I got to
think<00:01:42.240> to<00:01:42.299> myself<00:01:42.329> okay<00:01:42.869> he's<00:01:43.049> going<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.259> pop

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
think to myself okay he's going to pop

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.760 
think to myself okay he's going to pop
out<00:01:43.770> on<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.070> same<00:01:44.280> side<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.790> just<00:01:45.770> hid

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
out on the same side that you just hid

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
out on the same side that you just hid
or<00:01:47.310> he's<00:01:47.610> going<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:47.850> walk<00:01:47.970> around<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.420> come

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
or he's going to walk around and come

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:49.850 
or he's going to walk around and come
out<00:01:48.630> the<00:01:48.659> other<00:01:48.750> side<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:49.350> maybe<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.590> lob<00:01:49.829> a

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
out the other side so maybe I lob a

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.649 
out the other side so maybe I lob a
grenade<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.399> one<00:01:50.549> direction<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.030> then<00:01:51.210> I<00:01:51.329> walk

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
grenade in one direction and then I walk

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
grenade in one direction and then I walk
in<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.930> other<00:01:52.049> direction<00:01:52.259> and<00:01:52.740> then<00:01:52.860> you<00:01:53.310> know

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
in the other direction and then you know

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.020 
in the other direction and then you know
there's<00:01:53.670> all<00:01:53.790> sorts<00:01:54.030> of<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:55.759> you<00:01:56.759> know<00:01:56.790> maybe

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
there's all sorts of like you know maybe

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.609 
there's all sorts of like you know maybe
that<00:01:57.180> maybe<00:01:57.299> Skyrim's<00:01:57.780> just<00:01:58.200> because<00:01:58.439> it's

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that maybe Skyrim's just because it's

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.899 
that maybe Skyrim's just because it's
too<00:01:58.770> early<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.189> game<00:01:59.369> it's<00:01:59.610> gonna<00:01:59.700> get<00:01:59.850> a

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
too early in the game it's gonna get a

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.120 
too early in the game it's gonna get a
lot<00:02:00.060> more<00:02:00.119> difficult<00:02:00.719> but<00:02:01.079> so<00:02:01.409> far<00:02:01.619> it's<00:02:01.890> just

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
lot more difficult but so far it's just

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.600 
lot more difficult but so far it's just
you<00:02:02.610> know<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.810> just<00:02:03.890> just<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:05.009> mobile
