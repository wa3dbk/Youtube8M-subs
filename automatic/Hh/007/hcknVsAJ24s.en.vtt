them<00:00:57.690> in<00:00:57.870> her<00:00:57.960> honor<00:00:58.579> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.059> did<00:01:00.390> this<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
them in her honor and I did this to

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.130 
them in her honor and I did this to
reason<00:01:01.500> I<00:01:01.649> said<00:01:02.030> earlier<00:01:03.030> today<00:01:03.239> that<00:01:03.420> maybe<00:01:03.989> I

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
reason I said earlier today that maybe I

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
reason I said earlier today that maybe I
do<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.500> one<00:01:05.189> every<00:01:06.150> ten<00:01:06.450> days<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:08.640> dog<00:01:08.909> and

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
do it one every ten days the dog and

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.750 
do it one every ten days the dog and
then<00:01:09.540> they<00:01:09.810> can't<00:01:10.229> take<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.950> kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.369> stress

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
then they can't take that kind of stress

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.760 
then they can't take that kind of stress
very<00:01:12.270> often<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.320> still<00:01:13.799> bounce<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.500> I'm<00:01:16.740> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
very often and still bounce so I'm a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.380 
very often and still bounce so I'm a
firm<00:01:17.340> believer<00:01:17.509> that<00:01:18.860> dog<00:01:19.860> will<00:01:20.670> just<00:01:21.090> get
