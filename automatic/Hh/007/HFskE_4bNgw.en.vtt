00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
picky with going to the BIOS have to hit

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.899 
picky with going to the BIOS have to hit
it<00:01:07.619> really<00:01:07.860> quick<00:01:10.400> tap<00:01:11.400> it<00:01:11.720> there<00:01:12.720> we<00:01:12.780> go<00:01:13.909> okay

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909

a<00:04:28.650> CPU<00:04:29.100> fan<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:30.360> heatsink<00:04:30.870> get<00:04:31.050> all<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.200> dust

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
a CPU fan the heatsink get all the dust

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:32.990 
a CPU fan the heatsink get all the dust
under<00:04:31.620> there<00:04:31.890> so<00:04:32.100> usually<00:04:32.610> he's<00:04:32.700> a<00:04:32.760> lot<00:04:32.910> of

spontaneously<00:04:36.960> shut<00:04:37.680> down<00:04:38.030> when<00:04:39.030> it's

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
spontaneously shut down when it's

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:43.160 
spontaneously shut down when it's
booting<00:04:39.630> it's<00:04:40.320> just<00:04:40.470> odd<00:04:40.650> so<00:04:41.640> anyway<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.750> might

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170
