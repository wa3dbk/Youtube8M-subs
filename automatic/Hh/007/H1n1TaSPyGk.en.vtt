00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.260
 Celtic states and then it will not be 

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.780
 Welcome to a review of the mod for the 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.419
 version 0 point 9.5 of minecraft and 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.420
 channels in this case is version 2 ok 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:17.800
 mexican fashions and carles so beautiful 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:19.570
 how beautiful life is not how good it is 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.310
 are already implementing this mode for 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.900
 pocket edition obviously everything is missing 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.029
 many more things than the original 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.349
 that brings the pc mod but well I think 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:27.640
 that we are on the right track and you are 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.160
 he is very grateful to the creator who makes 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.689
 this by the way good before starting 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.730
 not that they are about launcher prosas using 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.470
 or in shows in 1.7 point 8 is here 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.850
 down in the description if you are interested and 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.470
 is also obviously down here a 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 description the forum link of the 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.530
 creator or what is it that they know you 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.450
 they give a touch and as you can see he's going to 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.400
 send directly to the minecraft forum 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.990
 universe and there's the button that says 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.850
 download in any way I already put it 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:51.520
 in red box for anything ok 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:53.080
 so then good and once having 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.730
 this is going to be downloaded and it 's a 

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.500
 point cited that they already know a package well 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.180
 of textures comes the mod and the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.650

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.290

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.810
 crest of all these messes not 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.970
 is the presidency of the web or is 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.979

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.750

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.310
 he adds also here they are as they can 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.560
 black we are to see how it is created fte no 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.649
 we are going to need these things that to me 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.149
 do not need and normal this to do 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.640
 an armor we need 22 and those 

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:08.259
 we need 22 coal and we need 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.789
 a sheet of paper ok 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.130
 how the black thread is made then simple 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.380
 with this normal thread and a piece of 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.090
 carbon that for each pair of this is going to 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.950
 give a black thread 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.569
 and the paper how it's done is three 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.489
 reeds ok that simple by system 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.170
 I knew possibly in Wii that he does not know 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.110
 so good is how they are made 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.440
 because the crest of peña a huevo are this 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.530
 four and the black pants 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.569

 forgiveness and the paper for the sack 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.150
 presidential and the shoes are 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.010
 simply four black threads 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.920
 so nothing so simple like that 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.840
 is what the letter g would look like 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.340
