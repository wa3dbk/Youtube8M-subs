and<00:01:41.130> expedition<00:01:41.700> value<00:01:41.910> will<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.170> 1.9<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:43.710> for

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
and expedition value will do 1.9 so for

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.610 
and expedition value will do 1.9 so for
the<00:01:44.190> start<00:01:44.460> experience<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:46.110> exponential

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:46.620 
the start experience and the exponential

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.510 
the start experience and the exponential
value<00:01:46.800> what<00:01:46.920> they<00:01:46.979> do<00:01:47.070> is<00:01:47.190> kind<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.400> work

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
value what they do is kind of work

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.440 
value what they do is kind of work
together<00:01:47.670> with<00:01:47.940> each<00:01:48.030> other<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.360> they

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
together with each other and they

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.390 
together with each other and they
determine<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.960> next<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.710> next<00:01:49.920> amount<00:01:50.310> of

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
determine the next the next amount of

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.290 
determine the next the next amount of
experience<00:01:50.610> you're<00:01:50.880> going<00:01:50.910> to<00:01:51.060> need<00:01:51.180> that

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
experience you're going to need that

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.950 
experience you're going to need that
love<00:01:51.479> love<00:01:51.660> so<00:01:52.350> it's<00:01:52.950> determined<00:01:53.280> with<00:01:53.610> this

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:53.960 
love love so it's determined with this

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.150 
love love so it's determined with this
so<00:01:54.960> how<00:01:55.050> much<00:01:55.140> I<00:01:55.290> would<00:01:55.410> need<00:01:55.530> need<00:01:56.010> to

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
so how much I would need need to

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:58.160 
so how much I would need need to
actually<00:01:56.280> level<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.700> again<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:57.690> I'm<00:01:57.960> not<00:01:58.050> going

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
actually level up again so I'm not going

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.450 
actually level up again so I'm not going
to<00:01:58.229> tell<00:01:58.290> you<00:01:58.380> how<00:01:58.440> that<00:01:58.619> works<00:01:58.650> exactly<00:01:59.040> but

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
to tell you how that works exactly but

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.160 
to tell you how that works exactly but
that's<00:01:59.550> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.850> the<00:02:00.000> gist<00:02:00.150> of<00:02:00.300> it<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:01.110> I'm

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
that's kind of the gist of it so I'm

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:02.930 
that's kind of the gist of it so I'm
going<00:02:01.200> to<00:02:01.350> save<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:02.580> then<00:02:02.640> we<00:02:02.790> go<00:02:02.910> into

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
going to save it and then we go into

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.330 
going to save it and then we go into
stats<00:02:03.619> there<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:04.770> there<00:02:04.979> it's<00:02:05.160> going<00:02:05.280> to

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
stats there it is there it's going to

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.550 
stats there it is there it's going to
copy<00:02:05.550> it<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.910> you<00:02:06.030> go<00:02:06.119> to<00:02:06.210> stats<00:02:06.509> now<00:02:07.290> it's<00:02:07.440> in

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
copy it and you go to stats now it's in

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.109 
copy it and you go to stats now it's in
there<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.950> I'm<00:02:08.009> also<00:02:08.160> going<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.340> put<00:02:08.459> into<00:02:08.640> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
there and I'm also going to put into the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180 
there and I'm also going to put into the
client<00:02:09.479> side<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.350> you<00:02:10.410> might<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.800> saying<00:02:10.830> why

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
client side now you might be saying why

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:14.510 
client side now you might be saying why
is<00:02:11.250> it<00:02:11.400> on<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.550> client<00:02:11.820> side<00:02:11.850> well<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:14.370> it

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
is it on the client side well really it

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:16.160 
is it on the client side well really it
just<00:02:14.550> kind<00:02:14.880> of<00:02:14.940> cuts<00:02:15.150> down<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.540> things

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
just kind of cuts down on the things

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:17.660 
just kind of cuts down on the things
that<00:02:16.320> would<00:02:16.410> be<00:02:16.500> or<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.739> bandwidth<00:02:17.340> it<00:02:17.489> saves

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
that would be or that bandwidth it saves

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.670 
that would be or that bandwidth it saves
bandwidth<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:18.270> because<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.320> instead

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
bandwidth on this because what instead

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.410 
bandwidth on this because what instead
of<00:02:19.800> sending<00:02:20.100> over<00:02:20.370> each<00:02:20.550> stat<00:02:20.820> individually

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
of sending over each stat individually

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150 
of sending over each stat individually
it<00:02:22.110> already<00:02:22.350> has<00:02:22.470> them<00:02:22.590> here<00:02:22.830> and<00:02:22.950> all<00:02:23.010> doses

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
it already has them here and all doses

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.890 
it already has them here and all doses
hold<00:02:23.430> the<00:02:23.489> information<00:02:23.940> so<00:02:24.120> they<00:02:24.540> can<00:02:24.570> edit

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
hold the information so they can edit

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930 
hold the information so they can edit
that<00:02:25.050> information<00:02:25.770> all<00:02:25.920> day<00:02:26.070> one<00:02:26.250> but<00:02:26.790> the

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
that information all day one but the

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.580 
that information all day one but the
server<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.360> still<00:02:27.600> going<00:02:27.690> to<00:02:27.780> refer<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.290> the

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
server is still going to refer to the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.229 
server is still going to refer to the
information<00:02:28.950> on<00:02:29.280> their<00:02:29.520> side<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.790> it's<00:02:30.090> still

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
information on their side and it's still

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.350 
information on their side and it's still
going<00:02:30.390> to<00:02:31.010> see<00:02:32.010> what<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.280> max<00:02:32.519> level<00:02:32.880> is<00:02:33.120> from

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
going to see what the max level is from

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.729 
going to see what the max level is from
their<00:02:33.510> side<00:02:33.720> and<00:02:33.750> stuff<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.260> that<00:02:34.320> steak<00:02:34.620> and

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:34.739 
their side and stuff like that steak and

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:35.660 
their side and stuff like that steak and
edit<00:02:34.920> those<00:02:35.010> all<00:02:35.190> they<00:02:35.250> want<00:02:35.430> but<00:02:35.489> it<00:02:35.640> won't

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
edit those all they want but it won't

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.699 
edit those all they want but it won't
change<00:02:35.820> it<00:02:36.120> they<00:02:36.239> on<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> server<00:02:36.630> so<00:02:37.590> now

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
change it they on the server so now

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.560 
change it they on the server so now
let's<00:02:37.830> restart<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> server

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:49.170 

re<00:02:44.570> and<00:02:45.760> go<00:02:46.760> into<00:02:46.880> this

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.550 

and<00:02:49.299> all<00:02:49.959> right<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.140> we're<00:02:50.230> back<00:02:50.349> in<00:02:50.379> the<00:02:50.500> game

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
and all right so we're back in the game

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.080 
and all right so we're back in the game
we<00:02:51.010> go<00:02:51.129> to<00:02:51.189> the<00:02:51.280> staff<00:02:51.459> you<00:02:51.549> see<00:02:51.760> we<00:02:51.939> have

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.090 
we go to the staff you see we have

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:53.789 
we go to the staff you see we have
attacked<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:52.629> offense<00:02:52.870> magic<00:02:53.230> prayer<00:02:53.530> and

00:02:53.789 --> 00:02:53.799 
attacked the offense magic prayer and

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:55.170 
attacked the offense magic prayer and
then<00:02:54.159> strength<00:02:54.459> so<00:02:54.790> it's<00:02:54.969> in<00:02:55.030> alphabetical

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
then strength so it's in alphabetical

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.270 
then strength so it's in alphabetical
order<00:02:55.629> same<00:02:56.560> order<00:02:56.769> here<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:58.200> then<00:02:59.200> really<00:02:59.469> it

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
order same order here and then really it

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.709 
order same order here and then really it
just<00:03:00.340> loads<00:03:00.909> and<00:03:01.060> everything<00:03:01.329> you<00:03:01.390> need<00:03:01.540> so

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
just loads and everything you need so

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:03.979 
just loads and everything you need so
you<00:03:01.750> have<00:03:02.319> the<00:03:02.469> one<00:03:02.680> level<00:03:03.069> one<00:03:03.219> Twitter<00:03:03.640> ahead

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
you have the one level one Twitter ahead

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.899 
you have the one level one Twitter ahead
55<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.140> next<00:03:05.379> level<00:03:05.620> and<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:06.189> image<00:03:06.430> icon<00:03:06.609> is

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
55 the next level and the image icon is

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.729 
55 the next level and the image icon is
that<00:03:07.060> printer<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.569> name<00:03:07.750> and<00:03:07.930> that's<00:03:08.469> that

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
that printer is a name and that's that

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.800 
that printer is a name and that's that
so<00:03:09.040> once<00:03:09.609> again<00:03:09.730> is<00:03:09.909> right<00:03:10.060> object<00:03:10.239> oriented

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
so once again is right object oriented

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.500 
so once again is right object oriented
and<00:03:11.650> i<00:03:12.159> can<00:03:12.310> add<00:03:12.489> in<00:03:12.670> as<00:03:12.819> many<00:03:12.939> as<00:03:13.120> i<00:03:13.209> want<00:03:13.239> to

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
and i can add in as many as i want to

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.910 
and i can add in as many as i want to
keep<00:03:13.629> on<00:03:13.719> going<00:03:13.930> down<00:03:14.079> to<00:03:14.260> the<00:03:14.319> next<00:03:14.469> level<00:03:14.829> the

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
keep on going down to the next level the
