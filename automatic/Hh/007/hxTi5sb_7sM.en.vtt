00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:06.330
 my name is igor i am a company engineer 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.950
 Oparah service today we will change 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 keyboard on acer aspire 5100 laptop 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.310
 As is known, these models are often enough 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:22.829
 meet offices though is special 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.269
 he made it not so difficult as 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.699
 may seem at first glance 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.769
 here we have the keyboard sin goes away 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:31.229
 decorative panel with power button 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.239
 with indicators and with functional 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:35.690
 keys to take us off 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.789
 keyboard first thing you need to remove this 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:46.260
 the decorative panel is removed very much 

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:49.620
 just shot further we have two 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:57.620
 which screws the keyboard holds on in 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:57.620
 in this position we twist 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.400
 neatly before 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.680
 shifting the keyboard to not 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:17.259
 tore off them here by the way he 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.259
 very short make it very 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:28.580
 we push the latch mounting but so us 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 the loop is all therefore removed further 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.909
 we install the new keyboard again 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.580
 we do it very carefully because 

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.270
 when connecting the connector can also 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.270
 easy format 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.780
 latches on the sides 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.780
 fasten hold you 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:35.080
 we live the decorative panel of the main doctor 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:37.840
 Doctors 300 so that all 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:39.730
 the keyboard has changed now with you 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.970
 let's talk about replacing buttons on 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.190
 Keyboards found fairly honestly 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:48.790
 when you need to change the keyboard is not entirely 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:51.579
 and what are some of the keys happening 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.690
 This for various reasons, the child is homemade 

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:56.700
 animal either just inattention 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:00.810
 there are two keyboards 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:03.340
 outwardly they are exactly the same but 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.209
 the problem is that by 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.120
 constructive 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:12.040
 with both drivers on the keys 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.150
 they are different why because two different 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.170
 manufacturers of soldiers and punch now 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:23.019
 will demonstrate 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:29.350
 remove the button here without it and the button 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:34.450
 here if you look carefully then 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:37.720
 the bottom of the keys is absolutely 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.810
 Solex design as we see the bottom 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.280
 fastener has a little less than 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.010
 on a gift background 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.269
 accordingly, these buttons are not 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.609
 interchangeable here that's driving 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:51.209
 the mechanism cannot be put on 

00:03:48.609 --> 00:03:52.359
 I will tell the construction myself a little about 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.419
 replacing 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:59.549
 about replacing the keys take the design 

00:03:55.419 --> 00:04:02.200
 dragons again as I said that 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.830
 pets or small children 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.530
 love to give these buttons 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.990
 About this happens this way 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.660
 moment assorted fu us in place and not 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:16.549
 suppressed nothing difficult to install 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:20.450
 the back button is done enough 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:22.760
 Carefully need to find the button that 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:26.600
 standing here it can be recognized and 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.850
 photos on any other since this 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.160
 keyboard qwerty location 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:35.270
 standard buttons and keys she has 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:40.940
 equally neatly put it on 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:43.130
 place and snap and no click 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.260
 you have to press the teacher can break 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.060
 constructive yes have to look for a new 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.200
 button and since I said that not all 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.210
 keyboards are the same 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.770
 Not a fact the garden button will find and 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.880
 the truth is likely to change 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:05:03.320
 the cliffs of this are completely floating 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:05.450
 constructive as it comes off entirely 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.970
 constructive who you have only two 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:10.040
 option to either find and install a fire 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:13.580
 new constructive or take sarikom 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:15.560
 keyboard this moment advise 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:22.760
 we have it so we now 

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:25.220
 demonstrate how to change it at the top 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:26.290
 there are two fasteners they need 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:29.210
 neatly fasten 

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:34.990
 a scalpel or another thin 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:39.850
 metal object on his shot 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:39.850
 Now we throw on the next 

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:47.439
 hook on the bottom a little up and 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:52.349
 again set to 

00:05:47.439 --> 00:05:52.349
 have at the top hooks expose key 

00:05:52.649 --> 00:06:02.249
 sometimes it comes off clicking 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:02.249
 rise rise night rubber gasket 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:15.069
 how to act in this case, everything is very 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:17.229
 just need to take the glue to climb 

00:06:15.069 --> 00:06:19.479
 a little bit on the rubber itself 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:22.569
 gasket and when put it in place 

00:06:19.479 --> 00:06:25.270
 and press but the glue should be not really 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:27.129
 a lot and push and should not be much 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:29.589
 strongly because there is a very heat 

00:06:27.129 --> 00:06:32.259
 either glue too much 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:34.689
 she depends on you in the same position and 

00:06:32.259 --> 00:06:35.769
 will be constantly pressing such cases 

00:06:34.689 --> 00:06:37.180
 say new 1 point 

00:06:35.769 --> 00:06:42.339
 and sometimes I'm afraid that I'm completely 

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:43.869
 keyboard other materials on this topic 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:47.339
