the<00:03:02.329> sound<00:03:02.890> was<00:03:03.890> a<00:03:03.920> I<00:03:04.840> went<00:03:05.840> and<00:03:05.930> got<00:03:05.989> a<00:03:06.109> lion

driver the lion driver helps

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.800 
driver the lion driver helps
tremendously<00:03:09.250> and<00:03:10.250> you<00:03:11.180> don't<00:03:11.359> have<00:03:11.480> to<00:03:11.629> have

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
tremendously and you don't have to have

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.349 
tremendously and you don't have to have
your<00:03:11.989> amp<00:03:12.290> set<00:03:12.859> sky-high<00:03:13.280> for<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:13.909> to<00:03:14.000> be<00:03:14.120> loud

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:14.359 
your amp set sky-high for it to be loud

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.630 
your amp set sky-high for it to be loud
because<00:03:14.720> it<00:03:15.109> sends<00:03:15.379> more<00:03:15.620> voltage<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.370> amp

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
because it sends more voltage to the amp

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:20.129 
because it sends more voltage to the amp
so<00:03:16.939> the<00:03:17.030> ant<00:03:17.209> does<00:03:17.420> less<00:03:17.659> work<00:03:18.459> many<00:03:19.459> questions

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:20.139 
so the ant does less work many questions

00:03:20.139 --> 00:03:25.209 
so the ant does less work many questions
ask<00:03:21.139> me<00:03:21.940> see<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.030> guys<00:03:23.150> later
