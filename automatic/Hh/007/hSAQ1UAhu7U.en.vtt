00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.790
 making planes was the dream of a child 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.300
 of this businessman in 2004 became 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.010
 reality and he created the fab factory 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.340
 Brazilian aircraft 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.850
 installed in uberlÃ¢ndia I started from 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.640
 designing children were models and each 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.220
 time I have been successful and the 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.160
 growing my projects I went there 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.109
 design the trailer and after training a 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.080
 little more sophisticated 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.059
 until I started designing the agricultural and 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.000
 now finally the boomerang that the 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.910
 four-seat executive with 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.340
 several others project much more daring 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.969
 at least two aircraft are manufactured 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:46.110
 per year and the price is around 450 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.320
 one thousand reais 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.230
 business customers from all over the 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.899
 lovers of aeronautics and to add 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.940
 production work the entrepreneur did 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 a partnership with the federal university 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.739
 Uberlandia with ufu on the side doing 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.310
 this partnership is learning with ufu 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.299
 using everything normal since everything that 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.250
 there are three of them again there and so 35 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.680
 collaborated a lot and we get very 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.560
 pleased that now more student more 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.420
 people are more dreamers together 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.460
 working the same idea 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.159
 according to the coordinator of the 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.409
 aeronautical engineering the partnership 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:31.619
 makes it possible for students to 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.570
 practice all the content seen in the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.000
 class in mechanical engineering college 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.040
 we have a set of laboratories in 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 that the students have practical classes on 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.259
 the disciplines but the contact with the 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 company brings training a 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.509
 additional training opportunities too 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.340
 important because here in fab they have 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.110
 opportunity to witness the 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.659
 development of a real aircraft 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.719
 then Miss becomes aware of 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.560
 the entire production process of a right 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.110
 aircraft 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.350
 students can also help 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.899
 develop models like this inspired 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.390
 No 14 bis of Saints Dumont 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.319
 for the teacher the goal is to have 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.140
 also exchange knowledge for what 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:17.569
 new projects can emerge 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.099
 can help is in the phases of 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.950
 development of this project which are 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.859
 the best options for right for this to 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.749
 this item is then transmitted 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:29.060
 technical knowledge right 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:31.250
 from the research point of view 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.810
 related to teachers and also to 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.719
 student participation then large 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.459
 part of the services are developed or 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:40.040
 tasks are developed by the students 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.010
 ufu aeronautics course has won 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.950
 visibility throughout the country and in the 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:48.079
 competitive process was 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.939
 81 students per vacancy 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.530
 this shows our understanding the 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.079
 first, that the course 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:57.019
 visibility because with the 

00:02:54.079 --> 00:03:00.409
 sisu students from all over the world 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.439
 regions of the country may apply for 

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:06.889
 ufu courses and in a certain way also 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.480
 shows in parallel the recognition 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.569
 So let's say the confidence that the 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:14.060
 community puts a new course as 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:16.459
 aeronautical engineering 

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.060
 demonstrated through the effort of the 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.659
 Faculty of Mechanical Engineering 

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.409
 the comparable levels of quality 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.409
 to other schools
