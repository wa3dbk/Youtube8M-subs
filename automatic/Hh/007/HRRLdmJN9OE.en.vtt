00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.359
 Last week we talked about it. 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:27.630
 of us writing our lives and 

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.220
 putting those points that reminds 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.240
 question exclamation in Vicenza 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.020
 comma 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:37.630
 well now the crucial point is 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:41.290
 the so-called end point 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.690
 just put that endpoint in the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:47.170
 Our lives and many things they need 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.420
 being placed is not as easy as 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:52.330
 It seems that for us we can 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.830
 truly turn the page of our 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.020
 life in some things 

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:58.390
 we need to put a point 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.570
 end so we do not stay there 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.210
 walking through life carrying weight and 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.250
 the more you live and the more or 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.740
 cosiness yesterday things the 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:11.770
 past more weight the person goes 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.140
 loading and less speed she 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:14.740
 Can walk to get closer to 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.050
 God 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:19.120
 looks interesting thing that I think 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.550
 we need to put an end to 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.680
 many things you see a full stop more 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.810
 easy that I see put into life is 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.970
 end point in addiction 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.620
 it seems like it's such a difficult thing but 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.920
 not near the others 

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:36.610
 cigarette endpoint at the end of the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.830
 end alcoholic beverage in drug 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.800
 are easier things but if you want to see 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:42.820
 one thing, for example in the 

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.240
 greediness 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:49.510
 it seems like a silly thing but the thing 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.900
 treacherous because through gluttony the 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.780
 person begins to have other things that 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.680
 for gluttony the person loses the balance 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.110
 start buying more than you can 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.540
 for gluttony the person also begins to speak 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.049
 more than it should 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.149
 so are so many things in such 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:12.909
 they say simple are not things of God 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.670
 going filtering in one's life 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.999
 she does not pay attention on pontoon boat 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.140
 for example the gossip that is a 

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:21.700
 terrible thing 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.900
 what is happening all over the world 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.910
 and happens inside the companies then 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.000
 It happens too much to hinder production 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.280
 one does gossip of other people's lives is 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.670
 talking badly about people sometimes 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.770
 destroy a life because the fruit gossip 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.300
 that is the envy 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.680
 often the person is envious of 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.810
 another that is something that did not 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.340
 afraid to put an end to life 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:50.560
 end point in envy is a feeling 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.070
 negative end point the pride that 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.320
 means arrogance delusions of grandeur 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.390
 of the people understood that we are 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.920
 we all have to see that 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:01.660
 we have the same rights 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:05.650
 We are all children of God in 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.580
 brothers and sisters, this pride of 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.239
 people 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.910
 jealousy is a very common thing also 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:15.610
 that is seen by jealousy how many and how many 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.180
 bad things that are happening for 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.900
 there 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.450
 end point also for example is in the 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.690
 laziness 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.420
 laziness is a terrible feeling that 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:30.700
 hinders the life of the person 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.810
 the person needs to have more power 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:35.049
 to win 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.760
 there are more tranquility to have 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.700
 more commitment to your things 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.650
 laziness is a dangerous thing in the 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.640
 person's life is more powerful in order to 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.570
 live feel more life put a 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.799
 guilt in remorse is a 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.720
 terrible thing 

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:55.000
 one of the worst feelings one of the worst 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.670
 that I see with the person feels remorse and 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.690
 blame blame for something that made 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:04.180
 said guilty of what did not do too 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.100
 I need to get rid of it and put those 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.489
 end points we can 

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:12.880
 releasing that ending point by 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.220
 example in humiliation how many and how many 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.650
 people live humbled by life 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.810
 puts an end to it 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.200
 end point a person doing 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:25.450
 what we do without need anymore 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.630
 end point of that feeling of wanting 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.129
 to be a victim 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:33.919
 we can not be a victim 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:35.119
 Do you want to be a victim? 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.039
 for the life 

00:04:35.119 --> 00:04:38.509
 you do not need to have that person 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:41.479
 have pity on you 

00:04:38.509 --> 00:04:44.089
 we have to respect 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.559
 respect of people then and placing 

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:49.399
 end point 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:53.089
 as I said in our insecurity in the 

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:56.050
 fear end point in sadness 

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:58.999
 life is joy and we need 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:01.360
 to receive this from God is only you to leave the 

00:04:58.999 --> 00:05:05.469
 your heart open to enter 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.929
 end point yes in the lack of humanity 

00:05:05.469 --> 00:05:11.539
 end point in the lack of charity with the 

00:05:08.929 --> 00:05:14.419
 next charity is only gives bread food 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:17.689
 or clothing is also clear but the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:20.449
 so charity of discretion the quality 

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:23.419
 of respect for the name extraneous to charity 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:25.369
 of you being silent about certain things 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:27.199
 do not get passed on things forward 

00:05:25.369 --> 00:05:30.679
 you do not know if they are true 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:33.979
 then those end points the dot so 

00:05:30.679 --> 00:05:36.219
 little one so bin is one of things 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:40.059
 harder to make a living because 

00:05:36.219 --> 00:05:43.999
 we stayed very much of the time 

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:46.610
 connected in the past and also connected to the 

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:48.679
 future and forget the times of the moment 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.869
 present that is the reality that is what 

00:05:48.679 --> 00:05:52.219
 now 

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:53.509
 today at that time when the 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:56.479
 present moment 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:05:58.399
 so we can use the past that 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.429
 we live and had that sometimes it is not 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:04.579
 good to remember as experience to be able 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:07.219
 it's salt and then with more 

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:10.789
 firmness with more joy with more 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:15.110
 confidence with more faith in God is clear 

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:17.319
 people plant a good positive gift and 

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:20.360
 receive in the front a harvest of 

00:06:17.319 --> 00:06:22.999
 prosperity is a good result that is 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.409
 merit of each person who proceeds if the 

00:06:22.999 --> 00:06:30.409
 This planting was nice to be with you more 

00:06:27.409 --> 00:06:33.199
 once here this week but week 

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:35.449
 Come on we'll be back with one more 

00:06:33.199 --> 00:06:39.879
 good seed program 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:39.879
 Stay with God and see you there.
