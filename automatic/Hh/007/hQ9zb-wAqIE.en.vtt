 hello everyone with you eagle owl and while I was 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.899
 Moscow, he was wasting time simply and not 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.970
 decided to solve the riddle the answer to which 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.849
 wants to know almost all lovers 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.620
 case opening I think almost every 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.599
 of you opened the chests in games whether 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.670
 it is a cross or dota and in the hope of 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.609
 that you drop a knife or extremely rare 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.010
 you get nothing after that you 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.800

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:28.619
 you can find only things in the answer forums 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.720
 lie and provocation and today I will tell 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.489
 how do you still fall out of things 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.160

 Asim you after all so it is no accident youtube 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.860
 bribes people say what it is 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.680
 absurd but true in 2006 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.660
 company wave press conference shaft 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.579
 world entered into a contract with one of 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.410

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.850

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.159
 grandfather from usa water network one of the women workers 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.950
 the tuba held the exhibition dota 2 1 began 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:09.479
 talk about the price of dota most susan wanted 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.790
 to make the game fritupley 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.799
 she told either what the trick would be and 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.950
 you guessed it 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.970
 chests where he obeyed her but 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.770
 here videobloger 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.659
 The fact is that the seminars are not owls 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.610
 division called you fall 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.909
 they are committed to contacting 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.509
 bloggers and ask to make them open case 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.500
 giving them 29 dollars 99 cents on 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.869
 opening chests 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.520
 but why not 30 on because geiba is not 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.100
 I like that there is a figure here 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.170
 3 points at this time makes the base 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.840
 youtuber name when he opens the case and 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.329
 so that he was worth something after all 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.030
 drop out of something expensive video is collected 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.640
 millions of views and at least 40 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.439
 percent who watched the movie go 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:59.310
 open chests and get nothing 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.290
 all youtube blogger gets the benefit 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.140
 it was not just a contract about 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.960
 mutual aid in 2006 not by the way yet 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.429
 then the conversation went about developing the game 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.860
 which will bring millions 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.879
 companies now in this game know how 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.620

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:19.560
