to<00:01:57.119> be<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:57.420> agree<00:01:57.630> I<00:01:57.810> agree<00:01:57.929> with<00:01:58.259> that<00:01:58.409> but

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
to be you agree I agree with that but

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.069 
to be you agree I agree with that but
that's<00:01:59.009> assuming<00:01:59.369> everything<00:02:00.119> goes<00:02:00.149> right<00:02:00.659> he

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
that's assuming everything goes right he

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.779 
that's assuming everything goes right he
has<00:02:01.200> very<00:02:01.470> little<00:02:01.709> foundation<00:02:02.219> if<00:02:02.520> he<00:02:02.640> has<00:02:02.759> a

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
has very little foundation if he has a

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.639 
has very little foundation if he has a
hiccup<00:02:03.119> between<00:02:03.959> now<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.319> the<00:02:04.380> Kentucky

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
hiccup between now and the Kentucky

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.800 
hiccup between now and the Kentucky
Derby<00:02:05.069> he<00:02:05.189> misses<00:02:05.459> any<00:02:05.549> time<00:02:05.880> training<00:02:06.239> he

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
Derby he misses any time training he

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.660 
Derby he misses any time training he
affected<00:02:07.469> more<00:02:07.679> than<00:02:07.739> a<00:02:07.950> horse<00:02:08.160> that<00:02:08.310> had<00:02:08.489> a

affected more than a horse that had a
better<00:02:08.940> foundation<00:02:09.209> that's<00:02:09.869> all<00:02:10.049> I'm<00:02:10.140> saying
