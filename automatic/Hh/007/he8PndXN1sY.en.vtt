00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
40s and I can still dunk and I use this

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.560 
40s and I can still dunk and I use this
program<00:00:51.140> basically<00:00:52.340> every<00:00:53.340> day<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> took<00:00:53.940> five

suggesting is that people purchase this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.149 
suggesting is that people purchase this
equipment<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:30.270> then<00:01:31.140> as<00:01:31.380> part<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.920> them

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
equipment and then as part of them

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.280 
equipment and then as part of them
purchasing<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:32.939> equipment<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.630> will<00:01:34.049> show

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
purchasing the equipment I will show

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.260

because the toe is the last thing that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.300 
because the toe is the last thing that
leaves<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.600> ground<00:01:42.869> with<00:01:43.200> vertical<00:01:43.590> so<00:01:44.189> how

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
leaves the ground with vertical so how
