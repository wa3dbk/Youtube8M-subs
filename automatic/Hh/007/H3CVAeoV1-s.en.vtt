00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
like what you see and now you want to

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
place a bet you might look a bit tricky

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.980 
place a bet you might look a bit tricky
at<00:00:08.790> first<00:00:08.820> purely<00:00:09.480> because<00:00:09.660> it<00:00:09.750> looks<00:00:09.900> a

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
at first purely because it looks a

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.180 
at first purely because it looks a
little<00:00:10.080> different<00:00:10.349> to<00:00:10.679> what<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.889> might<00:00:11.010> be

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
little different to what you might be

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.009 
little different to what you might be

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
used to from a betting site but in all

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.849 
used to from a betting site but in all
honesty<00:00:13.469> it<00:00:13.860> could<00:00:14.130> be<00:00:14.280> simpler<00:00:14.639> yeah<00:00:15.000> look

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
honesty it could be simpler yeah look

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:17.870 
honesty it could be simpler yeah look
the<00:00:16.859> first<00:00:17.070> thing<00:00:17.190> you'll<00:00:17.400> notice<00:00:17.580> when<00:00:17.699> you

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
the first thing you'll notice when you

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.090 
the first thing you'll notice when you
click<00:00:18.119> on<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.270> market<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.230> Betfair<00:00:19.710> uses

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
click on a market is that Betfair uses

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.560 
click on a market is that Betfair uses
decimal<00:00:20.550> odds<00:00:20.640> instead<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> traditional

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
decimal odds instead of the traditional

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.230 
decimal odds instead of the traditional
fractional<00:00:22.380> odds<00:00:22.500> like<00:00:22.769> 5<00:00:23.250> to<00:00:23.430> 2<00:00:23.609> they<00:00:24.060> might

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
fractional odds like 5 to 2 they might

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.779 
fractional odds like 5 to 2 they might
be<00:00:24.390> more<00:00:24.510> familiar<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.859> short<00:00:26.250> using

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
be more familiar with in short using

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.790 
be more familiar with in short using
decimals<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.480> much<00:00:27.869> easier<00:00:27.900> way<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.439> work

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
decimals is a much easier way to work

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.730 
decimals is a much easier way to work
out<00:00:29.039> what<00:00:29.460> odds<00:00:29.640> you're<00:00:29.880> getting<00:00:30.320> now<00:00:31.320> I've

the difference between 13 to 8 or 7 to 4

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.360 
the difference between 13 to 8 or 7 to 4
when<00:00:37.079> I<00:00:37.170> see<00:00:37.350> them<00:00:37.500> listed<00:00:37.770> as<00:00:37.950> odds<00:00:38.100> for<00:00:38.280> an

instantly while getting the number shown

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.690 
instantly while getting the number shown
is<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.170> return<00:00:43.500> I'll<00:00:43.680> get<00:00:43.890> from<00:00:44.250> one<00:00:44.430> pound

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
looking at is currently taking place

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.380 
looking at is currently taking place
right<00:01:19.439> now<00:01:19.950> and<00:01:20.250> that<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:21.000> bet<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.240> it

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
right now and that you can bet on it

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.899 
right now and that you can bet on it
life<00:01:21.780> as<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.290> happens<00:01:22.680> taking<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:23.520> football

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
life as it happens taking a football

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.149 
life as it happens taking a football
example<00:01:24.360> from<00:01:24.450> before<00:01:24.810> perhaps<00:01:25.439> Manchester

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
example from before perhaps Manchester

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.370 
example from before perhaps Manchester
United<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.670> down<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.150> nil<00:01:27.360> in<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> second<00:01:27.990> half

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
United go down to nil in the second half

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.069 
United go down to nil in the second half
well<00:01:29.250> without<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.700> ability<00:01:30.000> to<00:01:30.240> bet<00:01:30.600> in<00:01:30.810> play

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
well without the ability to bet in play

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.980 
well without the ability to bet in play
I'll<00:01:31.320> be<00:01:31.590> stuck<00:01:31.860> with<00:01:32.040> just<00:01:32.159> my<00:01:32.340> initial<00:01:32.520> bet

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
I'll be stuck with just my initial bet

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.690 
I'll be stuck with just my initial bet
maybe<00:01:33.990> I<00:01:34.110> think<00:01:34.229> Manchester<00:01:34.979> United<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> come

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
maybe I think Manchester United can come

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
maybe I think Manchester United can come
back<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.030> still<00:01:36.270> win

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
back and still win

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.960 
back and still win
well<00:01:37.200> I<00:01:37.409> could<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.890> them<00:01:38.070> again<00:01:38.400> now<00:01:38.700> a

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
well I could back them again now a

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.630 
well I could back them again now a
better<00:01:39.390> odds<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:40.079> increase<00:01:40.380> my<00:01:40.560> winnings<00:01:40.860> or

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
better odds to increase my winnings or

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.520 
better odds to increase my winnings or
maybe<00:01:42.000> I'll<00:01:42.150> think<00:01:42.390> Barcelona<00:01:42.930> will<00:01:43.229> hang<00:01:43.439> on

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
maybe I'll think Barcelona will hang on

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.100 
maybe I'll think Barcelona will hang on
to<00:01:43.590> win<00:01:43.860> well<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.880> could<00:01:45.119> back<00:01:45.299> them<00:01:45.570> right<00:01:45.810> now

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
to win well I could back them right now

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.450 
to win well I could back them right now
rather<00:01:46.530> than<00:01:46.680> being<00:01:46.860> stuck<00:01:47.009> with<00:01:47.189> my

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
rather than being stuck with my

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.420 
rather than being stuck with my
potentially<00:01:48.060> losing<00:01:48.329> initial<00:01:48.930> bet<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:50.100> even

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
potentially losing initial bet and even

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.859 
potentially losing initial bet and even
if<00:01:50.520> something<00:01:50.700> drastic<00:01:51.240> happens<00:01:51.570> and<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.720> want

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
if something drastic happens and I want

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.929 
if something drastic happens and I want
to<00:01:51.960> place<00:01:52.110> another<00:01:52.439> bet<00:01:52.649> perhaps<00:01:53.189> on<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.460> draw

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
to place another bet perhaps on the draw

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:56.149 
to place another bet perhaps on the draw
well<00:01:54.270> I<00:01:54.450> can<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.840> that<00:01:54.869> too<00:01:55.439> as<00:01:55.770> long<00:01:55.920> as<00:01:55.950> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
well I can do that too as long as the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.700 
well I can do that too as long as the
event<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.640> in<00:01:56.820> play<00:01:57.090> I<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:57.659> continue<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.469> back

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
event is in play I can continue to back

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.010 
event is in play I can continue to back
and<00:01:58.979> lay<00:01:59.280> right<00:01:59.759> up<00:02:00.000> until<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.420> end<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.840> cover
