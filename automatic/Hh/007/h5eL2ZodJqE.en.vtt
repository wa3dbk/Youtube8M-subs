A dam which Laos plans to build across the
Mekong River could wipe out critically endangered

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.780
dolphins in downstream Cambodia,
Phnom Penh - A dam which Laos plans to build

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:08.780
across the Mekong River could wipe out critically
endangered dolphins in downstream Cambodia,

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.120
the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) warned Thursday.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
If built, the controversial Don Sahong dam
in southern Laos would be just a kilometre

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.400
upstream of the main stretch of water favoured
by the rare freshwater Irrawaddy dolphin,

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.010
WWF said in a statement.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:31.199
With an estimated 85 adults, Cambodia hosts
one of the largest populations of the species

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.740
- which is recognisable by its bulging forehead
and distinctive blunt beak.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:41.740
Conservationists have called for the suspension
of the hydropower scheme, saying any restriction

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.190
of the waterway will curb the number of fish
swimming downstream and cut off the dolphins'

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:47.550
main food source.

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.070
"If the Don Sahong dam is built, it will lead
to the extinction of Mekong (Irrawaddy) dolphins,"

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.410
Chhith Sam Ath, WWF-Cambodia's country director,
told reporters.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.130
"Dolphins are very important for Cambodia.

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.479
They attract tourists, they are a national
treasure."

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.880
The dolphins face several other threats from
the dam, the conservation group added, explaining

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.420
explosives used in its construction could
damage their highly sensitive hearing which

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.530
they use to navigate.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:23.200
The likely worsening in water quality, an
increase in boats using the river and wider

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.229
habitat degradation would further pressure
the population, WWF said in a statement.

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.100
Landlocked communist Laos agreed in January
to hold further consultations with neighbouring

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.869
countries before it starts building the dam.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.639
Apart from the threat to the dolphins, wider
fears for the livelihoods of tens of thousands

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:48.060
of downstream fishermen and warnings of major
environmental damage have also been raised.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.630
WWF has urged Cambodian Prime Minister Hun
Sen to call for a moratorium on the dam at

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.670
the Mekong River Commission's summit in April.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.170
The Cambodian government in 2012 approved
a dolphin protection zone in a 180-kilometre-long

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:09.180
(110 mile) river stretch from eastern Kratie
to the border with Laos.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.420
Freshwater Irrawaddy dolphins exist in three
river systems in Southeast Asia, with Cambodia

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.870
hosting the largest population.
