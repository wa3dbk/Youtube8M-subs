00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.320 

those<00:02:09.740> weeks<00:02:10.040> had<00:02:10.399> an<00:02:10.520> anonymity<00:02:10.760> to<00:02:11.180> them

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
those weeks had an anonymity to them

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.020 
those weeks had an anonymity to them
there<00:02:11.480> were<00:02:11.600> so<00:02:11.870> many<00:02:12.400> different<00:02:13.400> you<00:02:13.880> know

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
there were so many different you know

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.730 
there were so many different you know
women<00:02:14.540> but<00:02:14.720> they<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:15.080> look<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.320> same<00:02:15.410> when
