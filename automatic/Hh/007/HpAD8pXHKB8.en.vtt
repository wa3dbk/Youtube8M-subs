spine<00:01:42.970> extend<00:01:43.690> the<00:01:43.810> arms<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.229> slide<00:01:44.500> and

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
spine extend the arms of the slide and

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.990 
spine extend the arms of the slide and
then<00:01:45.340> go<00:01:45.580> down<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:47.140> that<00:01:47.409> and<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.850> can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 
then go down like that and you can

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.510 
then go down like that and you can
switch<00:01:49.299> the<00:01:49.450> arms<00:01:49.780> right<00:01:49.930> here<00:01:49.960> and<00:01:50.520> double

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
switch the arms right here and double

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.240 
switch the arms right here and double
but<00:01:52.270> as<00:01:52.390> you<00:01:52.570> go<00:01:52.690> back<00:01:53.140> you<00:01:53.350> can<00:01:53.530> have<00:01:53.560> to<00:01:53.920> lean

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
but as you go back you can have to lean

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.350 
but as you go back you can have to lean
down<00:01:55.710> with<00:01:56.710> your<00:01:57.070> upper<00:01:57.369> body<00:01:57.520> as<00:01:57.880> you<00:01:57.940> do<00:01:58.210> that

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
down with your upper body as you do that

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.570 
down with your upper body as you do that
circle<00:01:58.780> so<00:01:59.020> same<00:01:59.500> exact<00:01:59.979> motion<00:02:00.280> you're

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
circle so same exact motion you're

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.420 
circle so same exact motion you're
bending<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:01.720> need<00:02:01.960> an<00:02:02.170> then<00:02:02.470> you<00:02:02.500> pushing

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
bending you need an then you pushing

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.359 
bending you need an then you pushing
back<00:02:03.640> but<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.270> cannot<00:02:04.450> be<00:02:04.630> you<00:02:05.140> all<00:02:05.920> have<00:02:06.190> a

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369 
back but you cannot be you all have a

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.369 
back but you cannot be you all have a
bigger<00:02:06.640> range<00:02:06.940> of<00:02:07.180> motion<00:02:07.570> forward<00:02:07.840> then<00:02:08.229> we

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:08.379 
bigger range of motion forward then we

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.670 
bigger range of motion forward then we
do<00:02:08.530> backward<00:02:09.119> so<00:02:10.119> when<00:02:10.810> you<00:02:10.899> go<00:02:11.019> forward<00:02:11.470> you

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
do backward so when you go forward you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:13.080 
do backward so when you go forward you
really<00:02:11.950> don't<00:02:12.129> have<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> drop<00:02:12.760> your<00:02:12.909> upper

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
really don't have to drop your upper

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.179 
really don't have to drop your upper
body<00:02:13.209> or<00:02:13.510> lean<00:02:13.720> back<00:02:14.019> to<00:02:14.319> exaggerate<00:02:14.920> the<00:02:15.040> hip

00:02:15.179 --> 00:02:15.189 
body or lean back to exaggerate the hip

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:17.490 
body or lean back to exaggerate the hip
motion<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.000> when<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.239> go<00:02:16.390> back<00:02:16.750> you<00:02:17.140> couldn't

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
motion but when you go back you couldn't

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.470 
motion but when you go back you couldn't
need<00:02:17.590> to<00:02:17.709> drop<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.310> alpha<00:02:18.580> body<00:02:18.760> to

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
need to drop the alpha body to

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.760 
need to drop the alpha body to
exaggerate

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:20.770 
exaggerate

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.650 
exaggerate
motion<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.550> from<00:02:21.790> here<00:02:22.000> if<00:02:22.240> your<00:02:22.390> hip<00:02:22.540> is

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
motion so from here if your hip is

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.570 
motion so from here if your hip is
forward<00:02:22.870> already<00:02:23.350> and<00:02:23.860> you<00:02:23.980> want<00:02:24.160> to<00:02:24.220> go<00:02:24.250> down

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
forward already and you want to go down

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.730 
forward already and you want to go down
then<00:02:25.210> Danny<00:02:25.570> of<00:02:26.200> course<00:02:26.260> to<00:02:26.650> start<00:02:26.950> and<00:02:27.660> just

the hip forward in drop drop okay stuff

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.710 
the hip forward in drop drop okay stuff
from<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.650> drop<00:02:36.340> in<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.610> back<00:02:36.820> the<00:02:37.480> first

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
from here drop in the back the first

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.200 
from here drop in the back the first
half<00:02:37.900> circle<00:02:38.320> going<00:02:39.010> forward<00:02:39.370> switch<00:02:40.000> those

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 
half circle going forward switch those

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:43.590 
half circle going forward switch those
arms<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:40.990> drop<00:02:41.860> drop<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.490> then<00:02:43.060> going<00:02:43.420> back

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
arms and drop drop and then going back

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.100 
arms and drop drop and then going back
against<00:02:43.900> which<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.200> arms<00:02:44.440> again<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:46.110> drop

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:47.110 
against which the arms again and drop

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.920 
against which the arms again and drop
the<00:02:47.230> apple<00:02:47.470> bottom<00:02:47.710> or<00:02:47.950> and<00:02:48.220> drop<00:02:48.940> top<00:02:49.210> so<00:02:49.780> the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:49.930 
the apple bottom or and drop top so the

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:56.250 
the apple bottom or and drop top so the
count<00:02:50.170> will<00:02:50.320> be<00:02:50.440> 1<00:02:51.030> 2<00:02:52.030> 3<00:02:52.420> 4<00:02:53.250> 1<00:02:54.250> 2<00:02:54.280> 3<00:02:55.150> 4<00:02:55.750> I<00:02:55.930> want<00:02:56.200> to

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
count will be 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 I want to

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.280 
count will be 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 I want to
give<00:02:56.440> a<00:02:56.500> like<00:02:56.680> this<00:02:56.890> one<00:02:57.370> too<00:02:58.320> double<00:03:00.180> 12

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
give a like this one too double 12

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.970 
give a like this one too double 12
double<00:03:02.290> one<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:04.060> dal<00:03:04.840> so<00:03:05.260> that's<00:03:05.470> your<00:03:05.590> big

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
double one to dal so that's your big

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.430 
double one to dal so that's your big
half<00:03:06.730> circle<00:03:07.210> so<00:03:07.300> I<00:03:07.390> don't<00:03:07.570> just<00:03:07.840> all<00:03:07.960> tiny<00:03:08.230> bit

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:08.440 
half circle so I don't just all tiny bit

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.630 
half circle so I don't just all tiny bit
faster<00:03:08.710> you<00:03:08.800> don't<00:03:08.920> want<00:03:09.040> to<00:03:09.100> do<00:03:09.160> it<00:03:09.250> too<00:03:09.370> fast

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:09.640 
faster you don't want to do it too fast

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:20.700 
faster you don't want to do it too fast
so<00:03:10.090> 12<00:03:11.280> double<00:03:13.140> 12<00:03:14.220> double<00:03:16.050> 12<00:03:17.160> double<00:03:18.900> 12<00:03:19.900> doh

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:20.710 
so 12 double 12 double 12 double 12 doh

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.650 
so 12 double 12 double 12 double 12 doh
so<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.100> don't<00:03:21.340> need<00:03:21.430> to<00:03:21.610> move<00:03:21.790> my<00:03:21.850> arms<00:03:22.300> too<00:03:22.480> much

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
so I don't need to move my arms too much

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.500 
so I don't need to move my arms too much
but<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:23.020> could<00:03:23.410> if<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.280> want<00:03:24.610> to<00:03:24.700> so<00:03:25.090> I<00:03:25.150> could<00:03:25.330> go

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
but I could if I want to so I could go

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:32.510 
but I could if I want to so I could go
one<00:03:26.250> two<00:03:27.660> double<00:03:28.660> social<00:03:29.620> arms<00:03:29.860> before<00:03:31.080> 12

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
one two double social arms before 12

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.540 
one two double social arms before 12
double<00:03:33.520> so<00:03:34.120> you<00:03:34.360> definitely<00:03:34.540> want<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:35.020> frame

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
double so you definitely want to frame

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:39.630 
double so you definitely want to frame
the<00:03:36.550> hip<00:03:36.790> that's<00:03:37.570> kick<00:03:37.870> in<00:03:38.050> or<00:03:38.530> drop<00:03:38.890> in<00:03:39.070> with

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
the hip that's kick in or drop in with

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.280 
the hip that's kick in or drop in with
the<00:03:39.760> arm<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.120> if<00:03:40.390> I'm<00:03:40.570> doing<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.900> left<00:03:41.080> hip

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:41.290 
the arm so if I'm doing the left hip

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.920 
the arm so if I'm doing the left hip
yoga<00:03:41.770> frame<00:03:42.100> that<00:03:42.640> hip<00:03:42.910> as<00:03:43.090> he<00:03:43.270> does<00:03:43.450> that<00:03:43.630> turn

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
yoga frame that hip as he does that turn

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:46.260 
yoga frame that hip as he does that turn
so<00:03:44.410> my<00:03:44.560> arm<00:03:44.770> must<00:03:45.010> be<00:03:45.130> extended<00:03:45.760> when<00:03:45.940> I<00:03:45.970> do<00:03:46.060> my

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:46.270 
so my arm must be extended when I do my

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.340 
so my arm must be extended when I do my
big<00:03:46.510> circle<00:03:47.050> ok<00:03:47.590> but<00:03:48.430> when<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.670> drop<00:03:49.090> I<00:03:49.450> could

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:50.350 
big circle ok but when I drop I could

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:52.500 
big circle ok but when I drop I could
switch<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.830> up<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.040> I<00:03:51.160> want<00:03:51.459> to<00:03:51.520> but<00:03:52.180> that's<00:03:52.360> not

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:52.510 
switch it up if I want to but that's not

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.730 
switch it up if I want to but that's not
necessary<00:03:53.140> either<00:03:53.590> ok<00:03:54.160> so<00:03:54.850> like<00:03:55.180> forward<00:03:55.740> I'm

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
necessary either ok so like forward I'm
