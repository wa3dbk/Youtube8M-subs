 report of strangers and I have to mark 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:51.589
 two categories of people in life 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.079
 which must either cut you off is deduced there 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:57.470

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.920
 the only difference with two sequelae 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.100

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.560
 open the doors in my body and they 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.210
 do it by a hope of going out with me 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.310
 and I hope that is very much 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.619
 strongly and in action that would be 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.020
 really easy for fewer hours of
