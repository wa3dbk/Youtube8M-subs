this<00:00:11.000> is<00:00:11.120> an<00:00:11.240> Indian<00:00:11.600> jujube

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:13.810 
this is an Indian jujube

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:17.880 
this is an Indian jujube
very<00:00:14.320> thick<00:00:15.040> woody<00:00:15.730> shell<00:00:16.500> so<00:00:17.500> what<00:00:17.680> you<00:00:17.770> have

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
very thick woody shell so what you have

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.040 
very thick woody shell so what you have
to<00:00:18.010> do<00:00:18.190> to<00:00:18.930> get<00:00:19.930> it<00:00:20.020> to<00:00:20.050> germinate<00:00:20.560> is<00:00:20.710> sand<00:00:21.460> out

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
to do to get it to germinate is sand out

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.260 
to do to get it to germinate is sand out
or<00:00:23.050> sand<00:00:23.320> down<00:00:23.500> the<00:00:23.740> outside<00:00:24.160> until<00:00:25.029> you<00:00:25.150> get

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
or sand down the outside until you get

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.340 
or sand down the outside until you get
to<00:00:25.390> the<00:00:25.570> brown<00:00:26.220> seed<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.810> best<00:00:28.990> way<00:00:29.110> to<00:00:29.140> do

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:29.350 
to the brown seed the best way to do

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.480 
to the brown seed the best way to do
that<00:00:29.500> is<00:00:29.860> with<00:00:30.130> a<00:00:31.320> high<00:00:32.320> speed<00:00:32.650> like<00:00:32.980> Dremel

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:33.490 
that is with a high speed like Dremel

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.000 
that is with a high speed like Dremel
sander<00:00:34.360> because<00:00:35.290> if<00:00:35.410> you<00:00:35.500> do<00:00:35.590> it<00:00:35.680> by<00:00:35.740> hand<00:00:35.920> it

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
sander because if you do it by hand it

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.280 
sander because if you do it by hand it
would<00:00:36.040> just<00:00:36.250> take<00:00:36.370> forever<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:38.020> this<00:00:38.230> is

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.290 
would just take forever so this is

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.870 
would just take forever so this is
probably<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.590> best<00:00:38.800> way<00:00:38.980> to<00:00:39.010> do<00:00:39.220> it<00:00:39.370> just<00:00:39.550> want

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:39.880 
probably the best way to do it just want

00:00:39.880 --> 00:01:14.069 
probably the best way to do it just want
to<00:00:39.970> show<00:00:40.090> you<00:00:40.320> you'd<00:00:41.320> want<00:00:41.500> to<00:00:41.530> go<00:00:41.650> too<00:00:41.710> far

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:14.079 

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:16.450 

just<00:01:15.079> want<00:01:15.229> to<00:01:15.289> go<00:01:15.380> far<00:01:15.619> enough<00:01:15.740> so<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.130> see

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
just want to go far enough so you see

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.179 
just want to go far enough so you see
the<00:01:16.670> brown<00:01:17.409> brown<00:01:18.409> little<00:01:18.710> seat<00:01:18.950> on<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
the brown brown little seat on the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:24.359 
the brown brown little seat on the
inside<00:01:19.810> you<00:01:20.810> can<00:01:20.960> see<00:01:21.140> it's<00:01:21.259> polluted<00:01:21.710> close

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:24.369 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:26.590 

but<00:01:25.369> you<00:01:25.429> want<00:01:25.579> to<00:01:25.640> expose<00:01:25.939> a<00:01:26.000> little<00:01:26.270> bit<00:01:26.390> more

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
but you want to expose a little bit more

00:01:26.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
but you want to expose a little bit more
than<00:01:26.750> that<00:01:26.929> so<00:01:27.259> we're<00:01:27.409> going<00:01:27.500> to<00:01:27.560> go<00:01:27.850> around

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.290 

actually<00:02:06.790> split<00:02:07.420> open<00:02:08.789> so<00:02:09.789> now<00:02:09.940> we<00:02:10.030> have<00:02:10.179> the

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
actually split open so now we have the

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.020 
actually split open so now we have the
exposed<00:02:10.980> seed<00:02:12.630> right<00:02:13.630> there

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.090 

and<00:02:17.120> these<00:02:17.750> are<00:02:18.470> interesting<00:02:18.890> is<00:02:18.980> they

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
and these are interesting is they

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.150 
and these are interesting is they
actually<00:02:19.250> have<00:02:19.430> two<00:02:19.850> seeds<00:02:20.330> in<00:02:20.510> every<00:02:21.069> one<00:02:22.069> of

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
actually have two seeds in every one of

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.920 
actually have two seeds in every one of
these<00:02:22.310> pods<00:02:23.110> the<00:02:24.110> other<00:02:24.290> ones<00:02:24.470> stuck<00:02:24.800> in<00:02:24.950> there

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
these pods the other ones stuck in there

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:32.180 
these pods the other ones stuck in there
would<00:02:26.930> open

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.200 

anyway<00:02:32.820> I've<00:02:33.120> done<00:02:33.270> this<00:02:33.390> before<00:02:33.450> so<00:02:35.210> few

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:36.210 
anyway I've done this before so few
