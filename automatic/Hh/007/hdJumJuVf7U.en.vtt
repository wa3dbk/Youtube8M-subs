00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:05.249 

you<00:00:04.240> know<00:00:04.359> I<00:00:04.390> didn't<00:00:04.630> think<00:00:04.720> the<00:00:04.870> first<00:00:04.899> half

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:05.259 
you know I didn't think the first half

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:06.539 
you know I didn't think the first half
was<00:00:05.290> that<00:00:05.560> great<00:00:05.830> I<00:00:06.009> thought<00:00:06.250> we<00:00:06.430> were<00:00:06.490> a

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:06.549 
was that great I thought we were a

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.310 
was that great I thought we were a
little<00:00:06.700> bit<00:00:06.880> passive<00:00:07.120> we<00:00:07.630> had<00:00:07.720> a<00:00:07.750> very<00:00:08.080> hard

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
little bit passive we had a very hard

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.220 
little bit passive we had a very hard
time<00:00:08.410> winning<00:00:08.769> second<00:00:09.280> balls<00:00:09.460> and<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:11.110> know

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
time winning second balls and you know

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.379 
time winning second balls and you know
in<00:00:11.650> in<00:00:12.099> possession<00:00:12.730> we<00:00:12.879> could<00:00:13.059> have<00:00:13.150> been<00:00:13.269> much

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:13.389 
in in possession we could have been much

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:16.440 
in in possession we could have been much
better<00:00:13.919> I<00:00:14.919> realized<00:00:15.579> that<00:00:15.759> the<00:00:15.999> field<00:00:16.240> had<00:00:16.420> a

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:16.450 
better I realized that the field had a

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.940 
better I realized that the field had a
lot<00:00:16.630> to<00:00:16.750> do<00:00:16.900> with<00:00:16.930> it<00:00:17.080> and<00:00:17.350> it<00:00:17.530> wasn't<00:00:17.860> easy

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:17.950 
lot to do with it and it wasn't easy

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.650 
lot to do with it and it wasn't easy
pitch<00:00:18.400> to<00:00:18.430> play<00:00:18.789> on<00:00:18.940> especially<00:00:19.270> when<00:00:19.539> you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:19.660 
pitch to play on especially when you

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:22.050 
pitch to play on especially when you
want<00:00:19.840> to<00:00:19.900> play<00:00:20.020> a<00:00:20.050> passing<00:00:20.560> game<00:00:20.770> like<00:00:20.980> ours<00:00:21.220> so

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
want to play a passing game like ours so

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.820 
want to play a passing game like ours so
you<00:00:22.390> know<00:00:22.480> that<00:00:22.660> affected<00:00:23.080> the<00:00:23.110> guys<00:00:23.350> and<00:00:23.680> then

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
you know that affected the guys and then

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:26.040 
you know that affected the guys and then
you<00:00:24.070> know<00:00:24.220> I<00:00:24.550> think<00:00:24.760> with<00:00:25.570> the<00:00:25.690> three<00:00:25.930> that

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.050 
you know I think with the three that

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.100 
you know I think with the three that
they<00:00:26.170> had<00:00:26.320> in<00:00:26.440> midfield<00:00:26.650> it<00:00:27.840> unbalanced<00:00:28.840> us<00:00:28.990> a

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.110 
they had in midfield it unbalanced us a

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:30.450 
they had in midfield it unbalanced us a
little<00:00:29.260> gave<00:00:29.530> us<00:00:29.650> a<00:00:29.770> disadvantage<00:00:30.340> in

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 
little gave us a disadvantage in

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.090 
little gave us a disadvantage in
midfield<00:00:30.640> it<00:00:31.570> was<00:00:31.690> hard<00:00:31.930> to<00:00:32.020> compensate<00:00:32.920> for

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
midfield it was hard to compensate for

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.500 
midfield it was hard to compensate for
that<00:00:33.129> and<00:00:33.399> as<00:00:33.550> a<00:00:33.579> result<00:00:33.820> we<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.300> know<00:00:34.390> we

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
that and as a result we you know we

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.180 
that and as a result we you know we
weren't<00:00:34.690> affected<00:00:35.170> winning<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.710> first<00:00:35.890> ball

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
weren't affected winning the first ball

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.240 
weren't affected winning the first ball
or<00:00:36.340> the<00:00:36.370> second<00:00:36.850> one<00:00:36.970> um<00:00:37.560> in<00:00:38.560> the<00:00:38.680> second<00:00:39.070> half

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:39.250 
or the second one um in the second half

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.390 
or the second one um in the second half
after<00:00:39.490> the<00:00:39.700> first<00:00:40.060> five<00:00:40.450> six<00:00:40.900> minutes<00:00:41.290> I<00:00:41.500> think

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:42.400 
after the first five six minutes I think

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.069 
after the first five six minutes I think
we<00:00:42.520> really<00:00:42.850> came<00:00:43.000> into<00:00:43.210> the<00:00:43.360> match<00:00:43.480> well<00:00:43.810> and

00:00:44.069 --> 00:00:44.079 
we really came into the match well and

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:45.930 
we really came into the match well and
we're<00:00:44.230> combining<00:00:44.530> central<00:00:45.400> you<00:00:45.640> know<00:00:45.760> and

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
we're combining central you know and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.370 
we're combining central you know and
those<00:00:46.060> of<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.390> spots<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:46.750> we<00:00:46.900> identified

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 
those of the spots that we identified

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.069 
those of the spots that we identified
before<00:00:47.500> the<00:00:47.829> game<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.750> we<00:00:49.750> can<00:00:49.780> potentially

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:50.079 
before the game that we can potentially

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:52.440 
before the game that we can potentially
hurt<00:00:50.649> them<00:00:50.890> it's<00:00:51.070> in<00:00:51.340> the<00:00:51.489> vertical<00:00:51.790> spaces

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.450 
hurt them it's in the vertical spaces

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.660 
hurt them it's in the vertical spaces
and<00:00:52.630> and<00:00:53.020> we<00:00:53.140> got<00:00:53.350> those<00:00:53.560> and<00:00:53.829> Kennedy<00:00:54.520> had

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
and and we got those and Kennedy had

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.889 
and and we got those and Kennedy had
some<00:00:54.850> good<00:00:54.970> opportunities<00:00:55.210> and<00:00:55.630> they<00:00:55.690> hear

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
some good opportunities and they hear

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.180 
some good opportunities and they hear
had<00:00:56.079> some<00:00:56.260> good<00:00:56.380> opportunities<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:57.100> we're

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
had some good opportunities and we're

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.940 
had some good opportunities and we're
moving<00:00:57.370> the<00:00:57.610> ball<00:00:57.760> well<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.470> the<00:00:59.470> second<00:00:59.829> half

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
moving the ball well and the second half

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:01.860 
moving the ball well and the second half
I<00:01:00.070> think<00:01:00.280> we<00:01:00.399> really<00:01:00.760> you<00:01:01.120> know<00:01:01.210> stepped<00:01:01.690> up

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
I think we really you know stepped up

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.439 
I think we really you know stepped up
the<00:01:01.989> performance<00:01:02.559> and<00:01:02.770> in<00:01:03.040> my<00:01:03.280> eyes<00:01:03.489> because

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 
the performance and in my eyes because

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.820 
the performance and in my eyes because
of<00:01:04.780> that<00:01:04.930> you<00:01:05.290> know<00:01:05.320> deserve<00:01:05.740> to<00:01:05.890> win<00:01:09.750> no<00:01:10.830> but

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
of that you know deserve to win no but

he deserved it you know he was a guy we

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:38.719 
he deserved it you know he was a guy we
wanted<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.709> hold<00:03:37.919> the<00:03:38.069> ball<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.459> create
