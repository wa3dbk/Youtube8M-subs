00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
second mile was a little tough just

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.209 
second mile was a little tough just
because<00:00:59.489> we<00:00:59.969> did<00:01:00.149> go<00:01:00.270> out<00:01:00.300> so<00:01:00.629> fast<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.219> then

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
because we did go out so fast and then

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.160 
because we did go out so fast and then

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
need I think it gave me a better idea

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.499 
need I think it gave me a better idea
what<00:01:26.250> it<00:01:26.340> would<00:01:26.430> take<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.670> qualify<00:01:27.270> for

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
what it would take to qualify for

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.230 
what it would take to qualify for
nationals<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:29.400> know<00:01:29.490> obviously<00:01:29.790> the<00:01:30.119> more

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
nationals you know obviously the more

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.370 
nationals you know obviously the more
you<00:01:30.360> raise<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.659> more<00:01:30.810> confident<00:01:31.200> you<00:01:31.320> have

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
you raise the more confident you have

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.970 
you raise the more confident you have
you

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:31.980 
you

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.590 
you
better<00:01:32.160> you<00:01:32.310> are<00:01:32.450> strategic<00:01:33.450> so<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.250> think<00:01:35.600> just

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
better you are strategic so I think just

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.870 
better you are strategic so I think just
generally<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.020> was<00:01:37.320> a<00:01:37.530> little<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.610> less

last year's national just the start is
really<00:03:59.450> overwhelming<00:03:59.660> because<00:04:00.020> there<00:04:00.200> are<00:04:00.290> so

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
really overwhelming because there are so

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.740 
really overwhelming because there are so
many<00:04:00.620> runners<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.280> have<00:04:01.490> sido<00:04:01.820> such<00:04:02.030> close<00:04:02.360> x

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:02.750 
many runners that have sido such close x

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:04.510

strategic<00:04:05.090> go<00:04:05.300> a<00:04:05.330> little<00:04:05.600> harder<00:04:05.840> I<00:04:06.020> think<00:04:06.380> and

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
strategic go a little harder I think and

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.170 
strategic go a little harder I think and
it<00:04:06.620> would<00:04:07.010> be<00:04:07.040> nice<00:04:07.280> maybe<00:04:07.550> an<00:04:07.820> improvement
