a demonstration you can do that yourself

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.310

to create your poll questions ahead of
time<00:04:35.930> rather<00:04:36.930> than<00:04:37.110> on<00:04:37.440> the<00:04:37.470> fly<00:04:37.830> I<00:04:37.860> think

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
time rather than on the fly I think

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.800 
time rather than on the fly I think
someone<00:04:38.610> asked<00:04:38.940> about<00:04:39.000> doing<00:04:39.450> them<00:04:39.570> on<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
someone asked about doing them on the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.590 
someone asked about doing them on the
fly<00:04:40.020> yesterday<00:04:40.590> and<00:04:40.890> you'll<00:04:41.400> see<00:04:41.610> that<00:04:41.790> there

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
fly yesterday and you'll see that there

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.840 
fly yesterday and you'll see that there
are<00:04:42.630> several<00:04:42.960> poll<00:04:43.410> pods<00:04:43.710> now<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.310> I<00:04:44.400> created

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
are several poll pods now that I created

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.470 
are several poll pods now that I created
just<00:04:45.150> in<00:04:45.450> playing<00:04:46.380> around<00:04:46.710> with<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.070> feature

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:47.480

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
but I did create one here that I might

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.260 
but I did create one here that I might
use<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.900> this<00:04:52.050> presentation<00:04:52.590> and<00:04:53.030> it's<00:04:54.030> called

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
multiple answers so let's make this one

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:06.890 
multiple answers so let's make this one
a<00:06:02.370> multiple<00:06:03.000> answer<00:06:05.570> what<00:06:06.570> is<00:06:06.690> your
