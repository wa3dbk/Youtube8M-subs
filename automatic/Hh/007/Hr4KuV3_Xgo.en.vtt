ago you need to get your bike up to
about<00:01:55.340> 140<00:01:55.790> degrees<00:01:56.180> let<00:01:56.420> it<00:01:56.510> sit<00:01:56.660> for<00:01:56.720> a

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
about 140 degrees let it sit for a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.120 
about 140 degrees let it sit for a
couple<00:01:56.990> of<00:01:57.020> minutes<00:01:57.140> you<00:01:57.770> know<00:01:57.830> you<00:01:57.950> should<00:01:58.070> be

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
couple of minutes you know you should be

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.950 
couple of minutes you know you should be
able<00:01:58.190> to<00:01:58.280> touch<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.700> side<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.660> engine<00:01:59.780> for

able to touch the side of the engine for
a<00:02:00.110> few<00:02:00.260> seconds<00:02:00.680> without<00:02:01.190> burning<00:02:01.400> yourself

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
a few seconds without burning yourself

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.740 
a few seconds without burning yourself
but<00:02:02.000> at<00:02:02.060> the<00:02:02.120> same<00:02:02.210> time<00:02:02.420> you<00:02:02.600> have<00:02:02.690> to

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
but at the same time you have to

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.030 
but at the same time you have to
remember<00:02:02.780> the<00:02:03.080> oil<00:02:03.110> needs<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.560> be<00:02:03.620> warm<00:02:03.920> to

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
remember the oil needs to be warm to

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.510 
remember the oil needs to be warm to
flow<00:02:04.220> out<00:02:04.400> easily<00:02:04.640> so<00:02:06.640> what<00:02:07.640> I<00:02:07.670> do<00:02:07.790> is<00:02:08.090> I<00:02:08.210> get

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
flow out easily so what I do is I get

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.060 
flow out easily so what I do is I get
the<00:02:10.520> drain<00:02:10.820> plugs<00:02:11.030> started<00:02:11.830> and<00:02:12.830> I<00:02:12.890> make<00:02:13.040> a

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:13.070 
the drain plugs started and I make a

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:22.260 
the drain plugs started and I make a
mess<00:02:13.510> want<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.570> have<00:02:14.660> a<00:02:14.720> rag<00:02:14.930> handy<00:02:15.260> nearby<00:02:18.490> so

function of the crush washer is to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.770 
function of the crush washer is to
actually<00:02:34.040> compress<00:02:34.459> a<00:02:34.760> little<00:02:35.030> bit<00:02:35.209> just<00:02:35.630> a

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
actually compress a little bit just a

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.260 
actually compress a little bit just a
little<00:02:36.080> bit<00:02:36.200> more<00:02:36.410> each<00:02:36.740> time<00:02:36.770> you<00:02:37.250> use<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.490> so

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
little bit more each time you use it so

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.510 
little bit more each time you use it so
that<00:02:38.480> it<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:39.680> have<00:02:39.860> to<00:02:40.040> torque<00:02:40.340> this

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:40.520 
that it you don't have to torque this

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.400 
that it you don't have to torque this
bolt<00:02:40.850> down<00:02:40.940> into<00:02:41.600> your<00:02:41.750> into<00:02:42.170> your<00:02:42.290> engine

bolt down into your into your engine
block<00:02:42.740> as<00:02:43.010> tight<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:44.000> know<00:02:44.120> there's<00:02:44.450> a<00:02:44.780> torque

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
block as tight you know there's a torque

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.080 
block as tight you know there's a torque
setting<00:02:45.470> on<00:02:45.590> it<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.860> it's<00:02:45.980> it's<00:02:46.310> not<00:02:46.550> really

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
setting on it and it's it's not really

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.790 
setting on it and it's it's not really
much<00:02:47.240> more<00:02:47.540> than<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.930> a<00:02:48.050> little<00:02:48.470> bit<00:02:48.620> more

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
much more than just a little bit more

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.710 
much more than just a little bit more
than<00:02:48.950> hand<00:02:49.190> tight<00:02:49.430> and<00:02:49.700> the<00:02:50.270> reason<00:02:50.540> for<00:02:50.570> that

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
than hand tight and the reason for that

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.840 
than hand tight and the reason for that
is<00:02:50.900> that<00:02:50.930> crush<00:02:51.470> washer<00:02:51.890> is<00:02:52.070> to<00:02:52.220> prevent<00:02:52.459> leaks

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
is that crush washer is to prevent leaks

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.580 
is that crush washer is to prevent leaks
so<00:02:53.360> that's<00:02:53.750> why<00:02:53.870> it<00:02:53.930> needs<00:02:54.050> to<00:02:54.140> be<00:02:54.230> replaced

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
so that's why it needs to be replaced

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.650 
so that's why it needs to be replaced
every<00:02:54.920> you<00:02:55.160> know<00:02:55.280> couple<00:02:55.640> three<00:02:56.300> four<00:02:56.480> oil

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
every you know couple three four oil

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.880 
every you know couple three four oil
changes<00:02:57.170> whenever<00:02:57.440> it's<00:02:57.590> no<00:02:57.709> longer

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
changes whenever it's no longer

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:59.590 
changes whenever it's no longer
squishing<00:02:58.430> down<00:02:58.610> you'll<00:02:58.880> be<00:02:59.239> able<00:02:59.330> to<00:02:59.450> see

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
squishing down you'll be able to see

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.850 
squishing down you'll be able to see
when<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.840> flattened<00:03:00.230> out<00:03:00.350> at<00:03:00.560> this<00:03:00.650> point

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:00.860 
when it's flattened out at this point

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.540 
when it's flattened out at this point
mine's<00:03:01.130> ready<00:03:01.400> to<00:03:01.550> be<00:03:01.640> replaced<00:03:03.519> but<00:03:04.519> the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
mine's ready to be replaced but the

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.699 
mine's ready to be replaced but the
function<00:03:07.550> of<00:03:07.640> the<00:03:07.730> crush<00:03:07.940> washer<00:03:08.420> is<00:03:08.709> probably

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:09.709 
function of the crush washer is probably

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.440 
function of the crush washer is probably
the<00:03:09.830> most<00:03:09.890> critical<00:03:10.100> thing<00:03:10.519> especially<00:03:11.000> since

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
the most critical thing especially since

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:12.820

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:12.830 
this is a steel bolt and we have

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.009 
this is a steel bolt and we have
aluminum<00:03:13.310> engine<00:03:13.459> block<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.030> it's<00:03:14.840> really

aluminum engine block and it's really

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:16.479 
aluminum engine block and it's really
easy<00:03:15.080> to<00:03:15.320> strip<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:15.800> threads<00:03:15.830> out<00:03:16.220> on<00:03:16.370> your

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:02.680 
the top of it which makes it really easy

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.039 
the top of it which makes it really easy
to<00:04:02.890> screw<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.030> off<00:04:04.150> of<00:04:04.180> the<00:04:04.450> bike<00:04:04.599> so<00:04:04.810> I<00:04:04.840> use

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
to screw on and off of the bike so I use

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.929 
to screw on and off of the bike so I use
the<00:04:05.170> KN<00:04:05.500> 138<00:04:06.069> just<00:04:06.280> for<00:04:06.400> the<00:04:06.459> simplicity<00:04:06.790> of

00:04:06.929 --> 00:04:06.939 
the KN 138 just for the simplicity of

let it drip down into my drip pan set it

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.029 
let it drip down into my drip pan set it
aside<00:04:14.700> then<00:04:15.700> using<00:04:15.970> fresh<00:04:16.329> oil<00:04:16.630> new<00:04:17.320> fresh<00:04:17.739> oil

I'm<00:04:18.940> going<00:04:19.209> to<00:04:19.269> pour<00:04:19.509> some<00:04:19.690> oil<00:04:19.840> down<00:04:20.229> in<00:04:20.440> here

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
I'm going to pour some oil down in here

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.279 
I'm going to pour some oil down in here
kind<00:04:21.430> of<00:04:21.489> half<00:04:21.639> fill<00:04:21.910> it<00:04:22.030> up<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.330> that<00:04:23.050> it's<00:04:23.169> not

00:04:23.279 --> 00:04:23.289 
kind of half fill it up so that it's not

00:04:23.289 --> 00:04:24.900 
kind of half fill it up so that it's not
completely<00:04:23.860> empty<00:04:24.009> when<00:04:24.250> I<00:04:24.310> first<00:04:24.550> start<00:04:24.789> the

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
completely empty when I first start the

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.370 
completely empty when I first start the
bike<00:04:25.060> because<00:04:25.660> this<00:04:25.810> is<00:04:25.930> actually<00:04:26.050> where<00:04:26.320> the

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:26.380 
bike because this is actually where the

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:27.810 
bike because this is actually where the
oil<00:04:26.560> goes<00:04:26.830> to<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.070> engine<00:04:27.310> from<00:04:27.490> and<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.669> want

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:27.820 
oil goes to the engine from and you want

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:28.620 
oil goes to the engine from and you want
to<00:04:27.880> make<00:04:27.970> sure<00:04:28.060> there's<00:04:28.240> a<00:04:28.270> little<00:04:28.419> bit<00:04:28.509> of<00:04:28.570> oil

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
to make sure there's a little bit of oil

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.939 
to make sure there's a little bit of oil
in<00:04:28.870> here<00:04:28.990> so<00:04:29.139> your<00:04:29.259> bike<00:04:29.380> doesn't<00:04:29.620> run<00:04:29.830> without

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:29.949 
in here so your bike doesn't run without

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:31.320 
in here so your bike doesn't run without
oil<00:04:30.070> for<00:04:30.460> two<00:04:30.580> or<00:04:30.669> three<00:04:30.789> seconds<00:04:31.120> when<00:04:31.270> you

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
oil for two or three seconds when you

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.689 
oil for two or three seconds when you
first<00:04:31.479> started<00:04:31.870> after<00:04:32.020> the<00:04:32.139> oil<00:04:32.380> change<00:04:32.699> next

first started after the oil change next

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:35.450 
first started after the oil change next
once<00:04:34.060> I<00:04:34.180> filled<00:04:34.389> this<00:04:34.479> a<00:04:34.539> little<00:04:34.690> bit<00:04:34.840> of<00:04:34.900> oil

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
once I filled this a little bit of oil

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.760 
once I filled this a little bit of oil
I'm<00:04:36.460> going<00:04:36.699> to<00:04:36.789> take<00:04:37.000> some<00:04:37.289> some<00:04:38.289> oil<00:04:38.500> on<00:04:38.680> my

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:52.780 
specification on it which I believe is

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.570 
specification on it which I believe is
hand<00:04:53.020> tight<00:04:53.259> and<00:04:53.289> then<00:04:53.500> a<00:04:53.620> half<00:04:53.800> turn<00:04:54.099> but<00:04:54.550> I

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
you simply add new oil pretty

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:26.760 
you simply add new oil pretty
straightforward

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.089 

when<00:05:27.669> you<00:05:27.759> add<00:05:27.910> oil<00:05:28.479> into<00:05:28.750> here<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.740> will<00:05:29.860> fill

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:30.099 
when you add oil into here it will fill

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.890 
when you add oil into here it will fill
and<00:05:30.340> then<00:05:30.460> it'll<00:05:30.610> bubble<00:05:30.849> through<00:05:31.210> as<00:05:31.630> it

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
and then it'll bubble through as it

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.550 
and then it'll bubble through as it
fills<00:05:32.139> the<00:05:32.319> filter<00:05:32.620> so<00:05:34.050> generally<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.349> point

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
fills the filter so generally the point

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.170 
fills the filter so generally the point
at<00:05:35.620> which<00:05:35.680> it<00:05:35.740> starts<00:05:35.889> bubbling<00:05:36.340> and<00:05:36.669> fills

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
at which it starts bubbling and fills

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.550 
at which it starts bubbling and fills
through<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.389> brim<00:05:37.599> that<00:05:37.810> I<00:05:37.840> would<00:05:38.050> stop<00:05:38.259> and

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
through the brim that I would stop and

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.809 
through the brim that I would stop and
it'll<00:05:38.740> kind<00:05:38.860> of<00:05:38.949> settle<00:05:39.220> back<00:05:39.310> halfway<00:05:39.550> down

00:05:39.809 --> 00:05:39.819 
it'll kind of settle back halfway down

00:05:39.819 --> 00:05:42.420 
it'll kind of settle back halfway down
that's<00:05:40.599> about<00:05:40.810> where<00:05:40.990> you<00:05:41.050> want<00:05:41.199> the<00:05:41.289> oil<00:05:41.430> just

that's about where you want the oil just

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.860 
that's about where you want the oil just
to<00:05:42.639> kind<00:05:42.940> of<00:05:42.970> get<00:05:43.090> some<00:05:43.330> in<00:05:43.449> it<00:05:43.539> to<00:05:43.660> get<00:05:43.780> it
