00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:07.379
 hello my name is veronika 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.059
 from www.mc blog.de also below in the 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.280
 video description just on it 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.059
 yes, welcome to this 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.460
 Video 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.470
 It's about the topic of metabolism 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.300
 So, how can I stimulate my 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 stimulate metabolism around my belly 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.580
 to finally get away again and with it 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 So it will be nice and flat again 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 There are certain foods if they are 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.939
 natural are that they help you 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.219
 then burn fat and easy 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.610
 to boost this fat machine 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:38.250
 an example is spinach, for example 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.540
 spinach cabbage and fish in koblenz on 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.570
 any case and are still good as 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.910
 So heart circulation drives a lot of spinach 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.489
 of course, do not eat this blood 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.710
 but without sarah course so 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.199
 natural 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:54.120
 what is still good for zucchini is up 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.710
 in any case, many zucchinis because they are 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.969
 really good because they are negative 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.969
 have calories 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.680
 because if you do is you consume 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.799
 In addition, it still means calories 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.600
 yes, then these negative calories 

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.080
 another food that something for 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.290
 Drink this is the green tea that is 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.330
 even really good with that your head and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.979

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.430
 upset 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.020
 Coffee is okay but with 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.060
 green tea works better 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.810

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.810
