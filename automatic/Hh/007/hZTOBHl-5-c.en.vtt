00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:07.160
 how about sports friends telemundo.com 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.110
 greetings francisco caves of the 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.720
 inglewood california that last night he lived 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.970
 a great boxing function and the return 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.620
 triumph of Juan Manuel Marquez who 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:17.689
 gave a real lesson to mike 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.789
 alvarado we talked with the little dynamite 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.590
 after the fight and these forms their 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:22.730
 words we knew it was a 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.560
 planning a tough fight 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.230
 we worked a lot the speed the 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.970
 side steps and that work we did 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.920
 above the ring moving the waist and 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.570
 it went perfectly, I think a 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.699
 error is paid expensive he made a mistake in 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.170
 lower my hand I connect and I went to the 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.269
 canvas but good I think there is no fight 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.399
 easy above the ring we made a 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.559
 great work great preparation and 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:44.510
 we attend we feel formidable I 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.249
 he connected a pretty solid right but 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.499
 it did not hurt me I got up well 

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.420
 even he went to look for her the fight on 

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:52.460
 went to find put connect motor blows 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.109
 is where I connect it also to 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.299
 backlash and things went 

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:58.719
 pretty good a great motivation the 

00:00:56.299 --> 00:01:00.859
 be back here in the in the forum 

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:02.749
 can give him a great fight the 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:04.729
 fiction I knew that go to the inn a 

00:01:02.749 --> 00:01:05.930
 tough rival a strong rival there and I 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.490
 I think we went out with our hands up 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.240
 but the most important thing is that we gave him 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.710
 a great fight this people who come 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.270
 says he's concerned with the kind of 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:17.630
 fighters that you are facing more 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.290
 great look I think here at the end 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.930
 of counts 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.390
 the weight did not have any problem but 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.280
 well I think that the important thing here was 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.780
 we keep speed not 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.090
 we went up so heavy that helped us 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.460
 quite because I think we change 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.910
 more the power for speed and I 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.060
 I think that was an important point for this 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:40.320
 I think that is the point where you have 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.140
 to get the character where you have to 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.780
 take the experience where you have to not 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.490
 let you dominate and that's where it's time 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.080
 precise where they connect you and you have to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.970
 answer and that is what we have 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.920
 used to do not let us 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.170
 are cornering us that they are 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.820
 throwing punches to be able to dominate the 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.470
 fight we are I believe that always 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.820
 we have been characterized by having a 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.400
 great backlash and now it turned out to the 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.080
 perfection save nothing I think there's 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.440
 that first rest take a decision 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.630
 with a cold mind being with the family and 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.030
 after that we will see that what 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.500
 comes I think before taking a 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.300
 decision to say I want the fifth fight 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.530
 I want to think about it very well I think that 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.450
 here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.190
 the question of training is going to 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.170
 change if that fifth fight is given 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.520
 and from there we will see how we feel and 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.380
 I think it's going to be a decision 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.060
 difficult a hard edition but good there 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:29.850
 that you have to think great joy 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.260
 can return here to the forum and I 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.580
 I said mike alvarado was a fighter 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.410
 difficult a strong fighter wanted 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.450
 give him a great fight the fiction 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.550
 I think it worked like a glove 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:40.290
 the hobby was happy a great 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.300
 fight there and the truth that I am very 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.250
 excited for having that opportunity 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.840
 to return here to the forum and give her 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.040
 is this great fight not regularly 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 when we have talked about him being a weight 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.040
 welter 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:57.629
 that has always been a stature of weight 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.519
 pen and that is fighting with men 

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.609
 larger than at the time of the hour they are 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:06.150
 mediums juniors and he does not give us the weight 

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:10.519
 in the morning I had 139 pounds and what 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:13.260
 we made breakfast strong to give 141 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:17.790
 141 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:19.620
 4 I think 4 or 6 are Juan Manuel Marquez 

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.079
 he said he would rest approximately two 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.239
 weeks before making a decision 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:25.590
 about what your next step will be but 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.870
 Without a doubt that if you want to reach 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.390
 a fifth crown in five categories 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.090
 different will have to face each other 

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:36.060
 fifth occasion to manny pacquiao this 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.980
 could happen in macao china greetings 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.980
 from English california
