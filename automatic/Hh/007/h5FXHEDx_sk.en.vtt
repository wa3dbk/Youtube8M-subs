00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.249
 new bluetooth keyboard that I purchased from the info gadget shop site mi 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:25.320
 the premium keyboard designed specifically for those has arrived in search of the month 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.260
 devices such as smartphonetab e 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.569
 who do not have a physical keyboard 

00:00:29.569 --> 00:00:34.050
 as we can from very thin keyboard is built in and silicone and is 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.609
 extremely portable we can fold it on itself 

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.320
 we can scrap it etas always carry it with us when we need one 

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:45.370
 physical keyboard but we can't take that with us 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.750
 the computer on we have. very thin laptop available. law 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.790
 clean washable arteries let's see how it works first of all we have to 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.010
 turn it on so sumatr dedicated switch will turn on this blue light 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.520
 so let's go to our phone 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.250
 we access bluetooth here too 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.480
 go in her mother's search devices we press the forage button 

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.400
 for the search the keyboard is identified almost immediately 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.870
 we wait for the phone 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:18.870
 oils 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:25.560
 we click on the cpc house wall of the indicated of kandahar through the 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560
 keyboard with a secret code 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.800
 we take it and then the first to live in moso is 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.000
 connected let's try this keyboard 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.710
 let's try to open the notepad just to give an example, now I won't be 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.320
 very comfortable because I have a video camera in front of us we try the same to write 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.820
 as you can see the keyboard works more than good I would say that there are not 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.900
 big typing problems were only a missing letter late 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.120
 the silicone-like keyboard &amp; lt does not return a maximum feedback 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.040
 levels but still we leave use mobility accommodation 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.670
 unfortunately the other English so we have to - get used to different 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.090
 layout of the drawing buttons question mark and then that's how it is here 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:31.659
 but and I would say that overall 

00:02:31.659 --> 00:02:35.599
 we can be satisfied with this group we have the keys 

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:40.179
 for the displacement we have more of the other function keys because we can 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:45.719
 going to adjust the brightness of the display we can and start enea 

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:49.639
 car deduction we can also change it obviously not settings 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:54.689
 all will work conai phones but most of them will be able to go 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.999
 also on our aiphone and by the priests for load had this compatible keyboard 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:03.299
 you too have text this computer following however the keyboard can also 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.079
 be connected to our devices directly via USB if this 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:09.969
 cable for macintosh very convenient equipment 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.319
 must be inserted in this part 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:14.169
 in the keyboard 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.889
 el abortion sb clearly in the device that could be a target for example 

00:03:18.889 --> 00:03:22.949
 overall I was quite satisfied with this keyboard works 

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:26.409
 more than good and very convenient to use when we are away from home 

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:29.379
 and we need a wider keyboard than the one that comes to us 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:32.159
 provided by our smart fortwo from our tablet 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:35.040
 I would say that we have concluded a greeting to all from riccardo of yourlifeupdated
