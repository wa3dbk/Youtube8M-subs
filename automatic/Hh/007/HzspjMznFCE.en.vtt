00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.410
 then is who is accompanying our 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.310
 videos leave the series no more than there is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.760
 huh 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:30.000
 if resistance is to enter the learning 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.099
 distance he will not be able to 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.180
 choose but the content that it uses with 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.829
 the students 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.899
 he will not be able to choose more 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.600
 activities he wanted for the students 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.000
 will already be ready a package that 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.399
 called structured teaching is not that 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.469
 many consultancies sell to the 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.340
 educational institutions are not ready the 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.170
 lesson plan lesson plan material 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:55.350
 activities bank of questions ne 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.780
 It's me too, registration is that I'm in. 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.090
 I 'm with you, he's a teacher. 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.000
 who resists because it's not that I resist 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.280
 one is a corporatism is not a 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.500
 resistance to the use of technology there is no 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.290
 resistance to distance education is 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.330
 a resistance to a method of education 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.070
 which we believe will work 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.259
 because we are working with 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.659
 students from small to working 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.030
 in higher education since childhood 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.710
 we know we studied in theory a 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.170
 hall in practice that works 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.150
 works and this method will not work 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.270
 for everything we talked about here in that 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.829
 method is to train people who study 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.640
 alone answering questions of 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.960
 multiple choice what then is it is us 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.970
 You have to be careful with that. 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.970
 resistance and other resistance 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.430
 which is legitimate is the two 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 actually a second thing is this the 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.549
 teacher can be trained to use 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.220
 technologies 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.960
 he is obliged to know how to use the network 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:56.810
 social and education 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:59.450
 know how to use video know this training 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.520
 needs to be done 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.259
 the teacher has to be paid in the 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.959
 working hours it out and make joe 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.120
 a course at a distance and only because he 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.470
 unpaid distance there is no distance if 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.660
 compulsory payments 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 prudence to pay only to her can 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.300
 plan some information and training 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.460
 Continuous continuous training is a 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.470
 two hours three hours is already 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:27.390
 solved the problem of things 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:31.320
 technology changes very quickly as well. 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:33.240
 technology is already essential. 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.820
 and today it is still more than 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:38.790
 you are to train the teacher continuously 

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:41.580
 is repeatedly so is this resistance 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.710
 also due to the lack of information 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.940
 and a third thing that resistance 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.240
 you also have to recognize that it is 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:49.830
 legitimate is thus the famous institution 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.709
 next we go to games now 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.020
 education use this here this game begins 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.490
 to use with students are saying 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.570
 the teacher works in the morning 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:02.790
 He teaches at school in the afternoon . 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:04.760
 In the morning and afternoon a school at night to 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:08.580
 me is a money 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.380
 not just but minimal there that he 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.230
 get ringing is doing it for 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 So, go home Saturday and Sunday. 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:17.280
 would she have her son? 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.280
 play started to study game 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.700
 I mean, the guy has the teacher. 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.810
 cat then has several lives 42 to 48 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.110
 hours to work 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.820
 this is an error then you have to in 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:31.230
 the working hours of the teacher he 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.570
 only if it is formed does it need to be 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.220
 familiar with the new tools is 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.540
 the way the thing done in many 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.700
 situations in which you have to do this 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.870
 here goes away now if you start to 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.950
 answer and mean 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.350
 This is another thing that has 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.700
 discussed in Brazil the issue of 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.540
 excuse in sao paulo think other 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.060
 places 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.010
 the question of the technological hour is because 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.440
 what happens is our teacher's contract 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.870
 Work with the teacher was made 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.790
 We prepare the class and she teaches the 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.470
 proof and proof proof at home 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.730
 today we actually prepare the class 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.830
 will there teaches with Israel only 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.480
 reply and mail gets involved in 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.790
 activities in environments 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.070
 learning is not remunerated. 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.570
 This is not it, it's not. 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.239
 original remuneration , it is clear that I 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.880
 I resist this, I'm taking my time. 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.459
 that she has to go back to the 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.470
 marketing to study whether the added value 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.479
 in distance education is here 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.400
 today I take my leisure time and I do not 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:26.690
 remunerate you for the work that is 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.690
 bringing profits from the institution 

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.530
 So it's the resistance I think when 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.600
 You take away all these resistances from me. 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.310
 I do not see teacher resistance is 

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.169
 learn it may be that the teacher wants to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.690
 learn all that well but is a minority 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:46.190
 because learning new things only has everything 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:47.720
 one flow process of a labor 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.430
 learning what has to be taken into 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.370
 consideration is that it is often not 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.460
 then the resistances are legitimate and 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.530
 I'm a tough one where the standard I 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.410
 I participate whenever I have some 

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:02.450
 problem of this type I participate 

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.800
 resisting also that I do not believe 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:05.810
 In this I think it has 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.530
 we have to be have to discuss these 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:13.630
 issues there create new models there 

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:13.630
 Compensation training is not perfect
