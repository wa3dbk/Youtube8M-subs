the hill tip it's a little bit more
advanced<00:00:08.189> than<00:00:08.280> last<00:00:08.550> time<00:00:08.670> and<00:00:09.540> it<00:00:09.630> won't

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
advanced than last time and it won't

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.330 
advanced than last time and it won't
always<00:00:09.960> be<00:00:10.110> useful<00:00:10.590> but<00:00:10.620> when<00:00:10.950> it<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.070> it's

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
always be useful but when it is it's

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.440 
always be useful but when it is it's
something<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.759> could<00:00:11.880> actually<00:00:11.969> win<00:00:12.389> you

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
something that could actually win you

something that could actually win you
the<00:00:12.570> entire<00:00:12.690> march<00:00:13.080> but<00:00:13.650> it's<00:00:14.250> not<00:00:14.370> gonna<00:00:14.460> be

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
the entire march but it's not gonna be

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:15.709 
the entire march but it's not gonna be
something<00:00:14.820> which<00:00:14.940> all<00:00:15.059> come<00:00:15.179> into<00:00:15.360> play<00:00:15.480> every

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
something which all come into play every

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.220

much<00:00:17.180> but<00:00:18.180> you<00:00:18.240> know<00:00:18.359> when<00:00:18.660> you<00:00:18.690> get<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:18.960> use<00:00:19.080> it

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
much but you know when you get to use it

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.599 
much but you know when you get to use it
it<00:00:19.380> might<00:00:19.529> actually<00:00:19.650> save<00:00:20.070> the<00:00:20.220> day<00:00:20.340> in<00:00:20.520> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.150 
it might actually save the day in the
March<00:00:20.789> so<00:00:21.449> it's<00:00:21.930> bit<00:00:22.410> of<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.560> controversial<00:00:22.980> one

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
March so it's bit of a controversial one

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.040 
March so it's bit of a controversial one
it<00:00:23.340> was<00:00:23.430> first<00:00:23.609> used<00:00:23.760> in<00:00:24.029> a<00:00:24.150> competitive<00:00:24.510> scrim

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
it was first used in a competitive scrim

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.710 
it was first used in a competitive scrim
and<00:00:25.230> between<00:00:26.099> two<00:00:26.279> teams<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.760> it<00:00:27.119> caused<00:00:27.570> a

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
and between two teams and it caused a

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.140 
and between two teams and it caused a
big<00:00:28.019> debate<00:00:28.170> on<00:00:28.410> Twitter<00:00:28.890> some<00:00:29.730> teams<00:00:29.910> felt

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
big debate on Twitter some teams felt

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.540 
big debate on Twitter some teams felt
like<00:00:30.359> it<00:00:30.480> was<00:00:30.570> more<00:00:30.720> of<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.840> glitch<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.550> some

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
like it was more of a glitch and some

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.880 
like it was more of a glitch and some
teams<00:00:32.759> felt<00:00:33.000> it<00:00:33.120> was<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> valid<00:00:33.540> tactic<00:00:33.899> and<00:00:34.110> but

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
teams felt it was a valid tactic and but

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.110 
teams felt it was a valid tactic and but
the<00:00:34.980> official<00:00:35.309> stance<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:35.969> solid

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
the official stance is that it's a solid

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.970 
the official stance is that it's a solid
tactics<00:00:36.600> oh<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.410> definitely<00:00:37.620> allowed<00:00:37.950> to

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
tactics oh so you definitely allowed to

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.260 
tactics oh so you definitely allowed to
do<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.340> and<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.730> don't<00:00:38.790> think<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.120> will<00:00:39.210> be

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
do it and I don't think it will be

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.869 
do it and I don't think it will be
getting<00:00:39.480> taken<00:00:39.780> out<00:00:39.870> any<00:00:40.350> time<00:00:40.620> soon<00:00:40.879> and

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
getting taken out any time soon and

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.319 
getting taken out any time soon and
while<00:00:42.570> that<00:00:42.600> thought<00:00:43.200> was<00:00:43.469> incredibly<00:00:43.920> stupid

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:44.329 
while that thought was incredibly stupid

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.760 
while that thought was incredibly stupid
now<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.390> first<00:00:45.570> thing<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.930> know<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.050> that<00:00:46.350> as

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
now the first thing to know is that as

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.319 
now the first thing to know is that as
you<00:00:46.950> can<00:00:47.039> see<00:00:47.219> i'm<00:00:47.309> capturing<00:00:47.550> this<00:00:47.850> ring<00:00:48.120> and

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you can see i'm capturing this ring and

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.119 
you can see i'm capturing this ring and
if<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.870> look<00:00:49.050> at<00:00:49.170> where<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.620> actually<00:00:49.770> says

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
if you look at where it actually says

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.380 
if you look at where it actually says
capture<00:00:50.520> and<00:00:50.640> it's<00:00:50.730> got<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> number<00:00:51.239> in<00:00:51.360> the

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
capture and it's got the number in the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
capture and it's got the number in the
circle<00:00:51.809> it<00:00:52.199> fills<00:00:52.620> up<00:00:52.829> slowly<00:00:53.300> as<00:00:54.300> i'm

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
circle it fills up slowly as i'm

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.689 
circle it fills up slowly as i'm
capturing<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:55.020> gets<00:00:55.379> more<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.309> more<00:00:56.370> filled

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
capturing it gets more and more filled

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.520 
capturing it gets more and more filled
up<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.000> my<00:00:57.480> team's<00:00:57.690> color<00:00:57.960> which<00:00:58.140> is<00:00:58.170> blue

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
up with my team's color which is blue

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.520 
up with my team's color which is blue
until<00:00:59.280> it's<00:00:59.489> full<00:00:59.760> and<00:00:59.940> actually<00:01:00.840> i'll<00:01:01.050> show

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
until it's full and actually i'll show

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.510 
until it's full and actually i'll show
it<00:01:01.559> again<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:02.010> you'll<00:01:02.129> see<00:01:02.280> that<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:02.489> are

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
it again and you'll see that there are

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.759 
it again and you'll see that there are
eight<00:01:02.789> little<00:01:03.180> segments<00:01:03.629> and<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.500> kind<00:01:04.710> of

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
eight little segments and it kind of

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.200 
eight little segments and it kind of
fills<00:01:04.949> up<00:01:05.159> so<00:01:05.430> you'll<00:01:05.909> see<00:01:06.150> there's<00:01:06.479> one<00:01:07.189> two

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
fills up so you'll see there's one two

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
fills up so you'll see there's one two
three<00:01:09.210> four<00:01:10.110> five<00:01:11.100> six<00:01:12.060> seven<00:01:12.990> eight<00:01:13.380> so

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
three four five six seven eight so

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.160 
three four five six seven eight so
that's<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:14.939> full<00:01:15.119> capture<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.840> if<00:01:15.960> there<00:01:16.080> are

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that's a full capture and if there are

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.330 
that's a full capture and if there are
two<00:01:16.290> of<00:01:16.409> your<00:01:16.500> team<00:01:16.680> members<00:01:16.950> standing<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
two of your team members standing in

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.499 
two of your team members standing in
then<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:17.520> will<00:01:17.670> go<00:01:17.790> up<00:01:17.820> two<00:01:18.000> segments<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.479> a

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
then it will go up two segments at a

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.789 
then it will go up two segments at a
time<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:18.869> I'll<00:01:18.960> come<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.200> it<00:01:19.290> twice<00:01:19.470> as<00:01:19.650> fast

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
time so I'll come to it twice as fast

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
time so I'll come to it twice as fast
and<00:01:20.100> now<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:20.850> just<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:21.060> general

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
and now that's just a general

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.999 
and now that's just a general
understanding<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.750> how<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> ring<00:01:22.140> works<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
understanding of how the ring works and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
understanding of how the ring works and
king<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.369> hill<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> it's<00:01:24.150> important<00:01:24.509> for

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
king of the hill and it's important for

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.899 
king of the hill and it's important for
the<00:01:24.659> next<00:01:24.840> stage<00:01:25.220> now<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.369> someone<00:01:26.610> realized

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
the next stage now what someone realized

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.310 
the next stage now what someone realized
was<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.180> as<00:01:27.390> long<00:01:27.540> as<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.869> hill<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.200> either

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
was that as long as the hill is either

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.350 
was that as long as the hill is either
neutral<00:01:28.619> or<00:01:28.920> captured<00:01:29.670> by<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.820> enemy<00:01:29.880> team<00:01:30.180> so

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
neutral or captured by the enemy team so

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.210 
neutral or captured by the enemy team so
that<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.720> break<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:30.960> then<00:01:31.500> this<00:01:31.860> will<00:01:32.070> be

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that you can break it then this will be

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.539 
that you can break it then this will be
possible<00:01:33.439> so<00:01:34.439> what<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:34.680> can<00:01:34.829> do<00:01:34.979> is<00:01:35.189> you<00:01:35.520> can

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
possible so what you can do is you can

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.760 
possible so what you can do is you can
prevent<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.090> hill<00:01:36.270> from<00:01:36.570> counting<00:01:36.990> down<00:01:37.140> by

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
prevent the hill from counting down by

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.160 
prevent the hill from counting down by
am<00:01:38.009> making<00:01:38.909> sure<00:01:38.970> that<00:01:39.210> the<00:01:39.299> hill<00:01:39.450> never<00:01:39.900> goes

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
am making sure that the hill never goes

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.530 
am making sure that the hill never goes
more<00:01:40.470> than<00:01:40.500> one<00:01:40.890> segment<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.430> time<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.299> if

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
more than one segment at a time so if

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:43.899 
more than one segment at a time so if
you<00:01:42.630> hop<00:01:42.810> in<00:01:42.960> and<00:01:43.079> out<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> ring<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.649> this

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
you hop in and out of the ring like this

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.819 
you hop in and out of the ring like this
then<00:01:44.909> you<00:01:45.000> can<00:01:45.119> see<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.420> stayin<00:01:45.659> on<00:01:45.689> 43<00:01:46.229> now

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
then you can see it's stayin on 43 now

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:47.990 
then you can see it's stayin on 43 now
you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.100> let<00:01:47.250> it<00:01:47.369> drop<00:01:47.579> more<00:01:47.729> than<00:01:47.880> one

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
you can let it drop more than one

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.670 
you can let it drop more than one
segment<00:01:48.240> on<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.630> won't<00:01:48.750> air<00:01:49.020> progressing<00:01:49.649> the

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
segment on it won't air progressing the

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.670 
segment on it won't air progressing the
points<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.220> if<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.520> ever<00:01:50.549> standing<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.270> and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 
points but if you ever standing it and

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.380 
points but if you ever standing it and
so<00:01:52.680> much<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.100> goes<00:01:53.280> up<00:01:53.460> two<00:01:53.880> segments

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
so much that it goes up two segments

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.539 
so much that it goes up two segments
every<00:01:55.140> two<00:01:55.259> segments<00:01:55.680> it<00:01:55.860> will<00:01:55.979> lose<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> point

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
every two segments it will lose a point

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.459 
every two segments it will lose a point
on<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:56.850> ring<00:01:57.030> so<00:01:57.509> obviously<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.110> ring<00:01:58.259> goes

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
on the ring so obviously the ring goes

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.020 
on the ring so obviously the ring goes
closer<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:59.070> closer<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.430> change<00:01:59.729> into<00:01:59.939> the

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
closer and closer to change into the

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.300 
closer and closer to change into the
next<00:02:00.210> location<00:02:00.350> but<00:02:01.350> as<00:02:01.710> long<00:02:01.829> as<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:01.979> hop<00:02:02.159> in

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
next location but as long as you hop in

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.700 
next location but as long as you hop in
and<00:02:02.430> out<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> the<00:02:02.700> ring<00:02:02.909> then<00:02:03.600> you're<00:02:04.200> able<00:02:04.320> to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
and out of the ring then you're able to

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.170 
and out of the ring then you're able to
keep<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.070> ring<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.340> forever<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:05.969> I'll<00:02:06.030> show

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
keep the ring that forever and I'll show

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.270 
keep the ring that forever and I'll show
you<00:02:06.240> why<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.719> useful<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:07.259> that<00:02:08.069> might<00:02:08.190> be

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
you why this is useful and that might be

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.800 
you why this is useful and that might be
a<00:02:08.310> little<00:02:08.399> bit<00:02:08.550> confusing<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.119> i'll<00:02:09.270> make<00:02:09.690> it

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
a little bit confusing but i'll make it

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.210 
a little bit confusing but i'll make it
i'll<00:02:09.929> make<00:02:10.050> it<00:02:10.170> clearer<00:02:10.410> with<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.069> next

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
i'll make it clearer with this next

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.850 
i'll make it clearer with this next
example<00:02:11.580> ok<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:13.050> Rings<00:02:13.230> neutral

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
example ok so the Rings neutral

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.290 
example ok so the Rings neutral
and<00:02:13.980> what<00:02:14.430> I'm<00:02:14.490> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.790> is<00:02:15.000> I'm<00:02:15.120> going<00:02:15.150> to

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.880 
and what I'm going to do is I'm going to
hop<00:02:15.450> in<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:15.690> out<00:02:15.870> of<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.230> ring<00:02:16.350> so<00:02:16.650> that<00:02:16.800> it

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890 
hop in and out of the ring so that it

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.620 
hop in and out of the ring so that it
only<00:02:17.040> ever<00:02:17.220> goes<00:02:17.520> up<00:02:17.730> and<00:02:17.880> down<00:02:17.940> one<00:02:18.420> segment

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:18.630 
only ever goes up and down one segment

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:20.780 
only ever goes up and down one segment
at<00:02:18.870> a<00:02:18.930> time<00:02:19.140> and<00:02:19.530> as<00:02:19.920> you<00:02:20.010> can<00:02:20.130> see<00:02:20.160> staying<00:02:20.670> on

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
at a time and as you can see staying on

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.760 
at a time and as you can see staying on
30<00:02:21.030> and<00:02:21.360> it<00:02:21.780> won't<00:02:21.990> change<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.350> 30<00:02:22.530> as<00:02:22.620> long

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
30 and it won't change from 30 as long

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.320 
30 and it won't change from 30 as long
as<00:02:22.860> I<00:02:22.920> keep<00:02:23.070> doing<00:02:23.190> that<00:02:23.430> now<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.120> I'm<00:02:24.180> going

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
as I keep doing that now what I'm going

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.970 
as I keep doing that now what I'm going
to<00:02:24.420> let<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.690> happen<00:02:25.230> is<00:02:25.560> I'm<00:02:25.680> going<00:02:25.770> to<00:02:25.860> let

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
to let them happen is I'm going to let

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.650 
to let them happen is I'm going to let
this<00:02:26.070> book<00:02:26.280> up<00:02:26.460> to<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.670> ring<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:27.270> show<00:02:27.300> when

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
this book up to the ring to show when

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:28.940 
this book up to the ring to show when
this<00:02:27.750> would<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.020> useful<00:02:28.320> in<00:02:28.560> a<00:02:28.620> real<00:02:28.770> game

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
this would be useful in a real game

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.280 
this would be useful in a real game
scenario<00:02:29.430> and<00:02:29.670> because<00:02:30.510> what<00:02:31.020> often<00:02:31.260> happens

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
scenario and because what often happens

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.220 
scenario and because what often happens
is<00:02:32.000> any<00:02:33.000> king<00:02:33.210> of<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:33.390> hill<00:02:33.510> match<00:02:33.690> when<00:02:34.140> it

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
is any king of the hill match when it

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:36.830 
is any king of the hill match when it
gets<00:02:34.320> to<00:02:34.650> towards<00:02:35.370> last<00:02:35.580> 50<00:02:35.910> or<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.270> points<00:02:36.690> and

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
gets to towards last 50 or so points and

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.270 
gets to towards last 50 or so points and
especially<00:02:37.110> after<00:02:37.380> the<00:02:37.560> last<00:02:37.590> 10<00:02:37.890> points

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280

where<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.490> next<00:02:38.790> to<00:02:38.940> location<00:02:39.390> shows<00:02:39.630> up<00:02:39.810> and

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
where the next to location shows up and

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.600 
where the next to location shows up and
the<00:02:40.650> team<00:02:40.830> who<00:02:40.980> owned<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.280> ring<00:02:41.459> will

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
the team who owned the ring will

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.250 
the team who owned the ring will
actually<00:02:42.060> just<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.540> don't<00:02:42.720> care<00:02:42.870> about<00:02:42.900> lost

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
actually just they don't care about lost

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.840 
actually just they don't care about lost
seven<00:02:43.860> or<00:02:43.920> eight<00:02:44.040> points<00:02:44.370> they<00:02:44.490> don't<00:02:44.640> care<00:02:44.760> if

seven or eight points they don't care if

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.460 
seven or eight points they don't care if
you<00:02:44.910> break<00:02:45.120> it<00:02:45.300> so<00:02:45.600> they'll<00:02:45.750> run<00:02:45.930> off<00:02:46.020> and<00:02:46.260> set

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
you break it so they'll run off and set

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.900 
you break it so they'll run off and set
up<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.890> next<00:02:47.010> hill<00:02:47.250> to<00:02:47.430> make<00:02:47.459> sure<00:02:47.700> that<00:02:47.850> you

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
up the next hill to make sure that you

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.370 
up the next hill to make sure that you
can't<00:02:48.060> break<00:02:48.240> the<00:02:48.330> neck<00:02:48.420> still<00:02:48.630> so<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.290> we

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
can't break the neck still so if we

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.449 
can't break the neck still so if we
pretend<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.680> we've<00:02:49.860> been<00:02:50.070> killed<00:02:50.310> we've

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
pretend that we've been killed we've

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:51.920 
pretend that we've been killed we've
just<00:02:50.640> spawned<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.420> we're<00:02:51.510> running<00:02:51.600> towards

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
just spawned and we're running towards

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.120 
just spawned and we're running towards
the<00:02:51.989> hill<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.230> got<00:02:52.350> a<00:02:52.380> few<00:02:52.560> seconds<00:02:52.890> left<00:02:53.040> so

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
the hill it's got a few seconds left so

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.250 
the hill it's got a few seconds left so
we<00:02:53.220> break<00:02:53.489> it<00:02:53.700> and<00:02:53.820> the<00:02:54.720> whole<00:02:54.870> of<00:02:54.900> the<00:02:55.080> team

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
we break it and the whole of the team

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.050 
we break it and the whole of the team
are<00:02:55.410> set<00:02:55.590> up<00:02:55.739> at<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.950> next<00:02:56.190> hill<00:02:56.310> now<00:02:56.760> what<00:02:56.940> we

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
are set up at the next hill now what we

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.210 
are set up at the next hill now what we
can<00:02:57.239> do<00:02:57.360> is<00:02:57.660> just<00:02:57.959> keep<00:02:58.260> this<00:02:58.410> Hill<00:02:58.590> here<00:02:58.620> for

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
can do is just keep this Hill here for

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.220 
can do is just keep this Hill here for
as<00:02:59.280> long<00:02:59.340> as<00:02:59.459> we<00:02:59.640> want<00:02:59.760> just<00:03:00.630> as<00:03:00.810> long<00:03:00.840> as<00:03:01.020> we<00:03:01.110> do

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
as long as we want just as long as we do

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:02.330 
as long as we want just as long as we do
this<00:03:01.380> so<00:03:01.739> they're<00:03:01.860> gonna<00:03:01.980> have<00:03:02.100> to<00:03:02.160> send

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
this so they're gonna have to send

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:03.800 
this so they're gonna have to send
someone<00:03:02.550> out<00:03:02.640> but<00:03:03.239> they<00:03:03.330> probably<00:03:03.510> won't<00:03:03.690> know

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
someone out but they probably won't know

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.420 
someone out but they probably won't know
what's<00:03:03.959> going<00:03:04.140> on<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.320> be<00:03:04.410> honest<00:03:04.650> so<00:03:05.100> you<00:03:05.190> can

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
what's going on to be honest so you can

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.100 
what's going on to be honest so you can
tell<00:03:05.580> your<00:03:05.610> teammates<00:03:06.090> go<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:06.840> I'll<00:03:06.900> break

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
tell your teammates go and I'll break

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:08.000 
tell your teammates go and I'll break
the<00:03:07.260> ring<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.500> doesn't<00:03:07.680> matter<00:03:07.830> how<00:03:07.890> many

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
the ring it doesn't matter how many

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.190 
the ring it doesn't matter how many
times<00:03:08.220> you<00:03:08.340> die<00:03:08.489> just<00:03:09.120> push<00:03:09.540> push<00:03:09.720> push<00:03:09.750> break

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
times you die just push push push break

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.990 
times you die just push push push break
this<00:03:10.350> up<00:03:10.410> because<00:03:11.100> I'm<00:03:11.520> going<00:03:11.640> to<00:03:11.700> keep<00:03:11.850> this

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
this up because I'm going to keep this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.510 
this up because I'm going to keep this
ring<00:03:12.239> here<00:03:12.510> and<00:03:12.800> now<00:03:13.800> this<00:03:14.070> isn't<00:03:14.250> the<00:03:14.400> best

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:14.520 
ring here and now this isn't the best

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.430 
ring here and now this isn't the best
example<00:03:14.970> because<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.780> other<00:03:16.020> Hill<00:03:16.260> is

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:16.440 
example because the other Hill is

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.990 
example because the other Hill is
actually<00:03:16.770> the<00:03:17.040> next<00:03:17.310> hill<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.580> just<00:03:17.610> across

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
actually the next hill is just across

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.220 
actually the next hill is just across
from<00:03:18.120> me<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.630> they<00:03:18.720> would<00:03:18.840> actually<00:03:18.900> able<00:03:19.140> to

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:19.230 
from me so they would actually able to

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.240 
from me so they would actually able to
see<00:03:19.410> me<00:03:19.590> but<00:03:20.280> in<00:03:20.760> example<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.330> this<00:03:21.480> next<00:03:21.660> one

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
see me but in example like this next one

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.009 
see me but in example like this next one
so<00:03:23.250> say<00:03:23.400> we<00:03:23.549> just<00:03:23.700> spawned<00:03:23.970> here<00:03:24.299> just<00:03:24.600> add<00:03:24.780> 10

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
so say we just spawned here just add 10

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.660 
so say we just spawned here just add 10
seconds<00:03:25.290> left<00:03:25.440> on<00:03:25.500> the<00:03:25.560> ring<00:03:25.769> and<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.370> next

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
seconds left on the ring and the next

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:27.800 
seconds left on the ring and the next
hills<00:03:26.820> over<00:03:27.030> there<00:03:27.180> and<00:03:27.390> they're<00:03:27.540> all<00:03:27.660> running

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
hills over there and they're all running

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.039 
hills over there and they're all running
up<00:03:27.989> those<00:03:28.110> stairs<00:03:28.320> now<00:03:29.180> then<00:03:30.180> obviously<00:03:30.540> if

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
up those stairs now then obviously if

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:32.740 
up those stairs now then obviously if
they're<00:03:31.260> set<00:03:31.410> up<00:03:31.500> at<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.739> ring<00:03:31.950> they<00:03:32.310> set<00:03:32.519> up

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
they're set up at that ring they set up

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.360 
they're set up at that ring they set up
they're<00:03:33.750> all<00:03:33.870> getting<00:03:33.989> a<00:03:34.140> lunch<00:03:34.290> salt<00:03:34.560> and<00:03:35.130> you

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
they're all getting a lunch salt and you

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.280 
they're all getting a lunch salt and you
just<00:03:35.489> hop<00:03:35.790> in<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.030> out<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.239> ring<00:03:36.510> then<00:03:37.110> am

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
just hop in and out this ring then am

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:38.750 
just hop in and out this ring then am
they're<00:03:37.530> not<00:03:37.620> going<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.830> be<00:03:37.890> able<00:03:37.950> to<00:03:38.220> see<00:03:38.610> you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
they're not going to be able to see you

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.100 
they're not going to be able to see you
so<00:03:39.030> you'll<00:03:39.269> be<00:03:39.360> able<00:03:39.420> to<00:03:39.540> do<00:03:39.600> this<00:03:39.720> pretty<00:03:39.930> much

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
so you'll be able to do this pretty much

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.050 
so you'll be able to do this pretty much
for<00:03:40.230> as<00:03:40.290> long<00:03:40.380> as<00:03:40.440> you<00:03:40.500> want<00:03:40.709> until<00:03:41.060> they

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
for as long as you want until they

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.420 
for as long as you want until they
figure<00:03:42.299> out<00:03:42.360> what's<00:03:42.450> going<00:03:42.630> on<00:03:42.840> but<00:03:43.049> and

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430 
figure out what's going on but and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.500 
figure out what's going on but and
really<00:03:44.430> they're<00:03:44.549> not<00:03:44.580> they're<00:03:45.180> probably<00:03:45.360> not

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
really they're not they're probably not

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.690 
really they're not they're probably not
going<00:03:45.600> to<00:03:45.720> know<00:03:45.840> what's<00:03:46.739> happening<00:03:46.799> and<00:03:47.190> even

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
going to know what's happening and even

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.890 
going to know what's happening and even
if<00:03:47.790> they<00:03:47.880> do<00:03:47.940> then<00:03:48.239> they<00:03:48.269> still<00:03:48.510> have<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.690> send

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
if they do then they still have to send

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.750 
if they do then they still have to send
someone<00:03:49.019> out<00:03:49.110> so<00:03:49.500> it<00:03:49.650> makes<00:03:49.799> the<00:03:49.920> setup<00:03:50.280> even

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
someone out so it makes the setup even

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.430 
someone out so it makes the setup even
easy<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.060> break<00:03:51.239> and<00:03:51.510> because<00:03:52.260> they're

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
easy to break and because they're

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.780 
easy to break and because they're
sending<00:03:52.709> one<00:03:52.980> or<00:03:53.010> two<00:03:53.190> people<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.640> come<00:03:53.760> and

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
sending one or two people to come and

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.340 
sending one or two people to come and
stop<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.120> from<00:03:54.269> doing<00:03:54.420> this<00:03:54.660> and<00:03:54.900> if<00:03:55.260> you

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
stop you from doing this and if you

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.930 
stop you from doing this and if you
think<00:03:55.530> about<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:55.830> them<00:03:55.920> up<00:03:56.010> like<00:03:56.190> trenches<00:03:56.700> if

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
think about on them up like trenches if

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.020 
think about on them up like trenches if
it's<00:03:57.600> one<00:03:57.780> of<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.080> hills<00:03:58.320> at<00:03:58.890> the<00:03:58.980> top<00:03:59.190> bar<00:03:59.489> the

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:00.030 
it's one of the hills at the top bar the

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.750 
it's one of the hills at the top bar the
top<00:04:00.510> barricades<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:02.070> next<00:04:02.280> hill<00:04:02.489> is

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
top barricades and the next hill is

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.490 
top barricades and the next hill is
going<00:04:03.330> down<00:04:03.450> to<00:04:03.510> the<00:04:03.660> digger<00:04:03.930> area<00:04:04.260> and

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
going down to the digger area and

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.229 
going down to the digger area and
they've<00:04:04.860> got<00:04:04.890> all<00:04:05.250> five<00:04:05.549> of<00:04:05.580> their<00:04:05.880> teammates

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
they've got all five of their teammates

because the mobius strip is a
loop<00:04:26.099> and<00:04:26.370> you<00:04:26.819> can<00:04:26.939> keep<00:04:27.060> this<00:04:27.300> circle<00:04:27.990> going

00:04:28.339 --> 00:04:28.349 
loop and you can keep this circle going

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:30.260 
loop and you can keep this circle going
