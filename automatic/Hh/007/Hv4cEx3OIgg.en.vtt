00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.840
 Now we're going to meet the five 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.939
 basic designs built around the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.369
 arm of the guitar where they can be 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:24.800
 also done on the guitar is if you have a 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:27.470
 focus steel rope with that arm 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.180
 I thin with that little opening here 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.130
 in the body of the guitar having an access 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.530
 facilitated in the acute region 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:36.320
 depending on the situation it gives you 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.870
 do the five drawings there if you have 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.180
 a traditional game suddenly the 5 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.829
 especially the older adults will 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.289
 be a little more difficult but at least 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.480
 four drawings will do everything 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:50.059
 well but when I say four drawings 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.949
 depends on the tone if you change the tone 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.410
 all five drawings can be 

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:57.050
 practiced in your rock 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.179
 so we'll know the sound 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.190
 of these five scales before 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:04.760
 know the tablature of each other 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.590
 of the animals an observation as in class 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.620
 the largest scales that I went to 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:12.320
 you models upon higher tone 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.870
 Let's use your relative minor, shall we? 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:17.660
 do the five thinking drawings now 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:19.310
 in there smaller with this information to the 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.170
 show here on the guitar arm the 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.380
 from where we are going to start 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.650
 build the smallest scales from there 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.350
 well then I 'm going to leave this region no 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:34.280
 be fashion, here we are going to have three 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.300
 drawings and here in the 12th house fifth string 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.540
 we will have two scale drawings of 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.300
 there are also smaller, sharper drawings 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.490
 so let's go to our five drawings of 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.320
 small scale down the arm of the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.320
 number 1 guitar design 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.850
 so these are the five drawings of the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.960
 small scale 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.690
 now I'll do a little more 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.610
 slowly so you can view it 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:06.650
 together with the tablature there is the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.080
 moment you pick up the guitar and 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.420
 then slow down, study. 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.730
 drawing for example decorating all of them 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.280
 All right, let's follow that same order. 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:29.600
 of the drawings and I just passed it to you 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:31.489
 is drawing number one ever going 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.250
 and coming back is up and down 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:36.709
 so let's go to a practical study there in 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.080
 your house with these five drawings of 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.890
 smaller scales all worked is not 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.260
 better not 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.180
 you can decorate it there by watching the 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.880
 own video and for safety reasons 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.790
 from your study I advise you here 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.130
 in the video description access the link 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:54.530
 that there is the tablature for you 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.670
 print at home all right and the last one 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.190
 class reminder 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.160
 if suddenly you already decorated easily 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.870
 these five practical examples 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.880
 giving a reminder from time to time 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.430
 on the larger scale so you do not 

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.040
 I can confuse the drawings and realize 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.110
 well the difference of one pro in the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.230
 part of the mechanics that in the part 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.010
 Sound good, then pass the ball to 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.410
 you 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.380
 good practice practice because 

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.410
 with us we did on the larger scales the 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:25.970
 next two classes we will do with 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:28.910
 help of the godofredo who is our 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.100
 Metronome we're going to do exercises 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.920
 practice on top of these five present 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:35.920
 so, but all and until our next class
