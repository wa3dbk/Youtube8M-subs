frequently<00:00:42.899> and<00:00:43.079> consistently<00:00:43.739> it<00:00:44.370> may<00:00:44.579> take

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
frequently and consistently it may take

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.279 
frequently and consistently it may take
a<00:00:44.820> couple<00:00:44.940> of<00:00:45.239> weeks<00:00:45.420> for<00:00:45.600> me<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.840> get<00:00:45.930> into<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
a couple of weeks for me to get into the

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.290 
a couple of weeks for me to get into the
groove<00:00:46.440> of<00:00:46.649> things<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:47.219> see<00:00:47.430> how<00:00:47.700> many<00:00:47.760> videos

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
groove of things to see how many videos

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.380 
groove of things to see how many videos
I<00:00:48.539> can<00:00:48.780> produce<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.410> week<00:00:50.030> initially<00:00:51.030> I<00:00:51.059> think

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
I can produce a week initially I think

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.650 
I can produce a week initially I think
maybe<00:00:51.629> somewhere<00:00:52.170> around<00:00:52.230> three<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.879> four<00:00:54.210> so

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
maybe somewhere around three to four so

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.650 
maybe somewhere around three to four so
hopefully<00:00:55.230> if<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.890> can<00:00:56.100> maintain<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.660> that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
hopefully if I can maintain that that

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.660 
hopefully if I can maintain that that
would<00:00:57.809> be<00:00:57.899> good<00:00:58.050> in<00:00:58.260> terms<00:00:58.949> of<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.309> types<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
would be good in terms of the types of

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.420 
would be good in terms of the types of
content<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.420> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.690> expect<00:01:01.050> to<00:01:01.140> see

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
content that you can expect to see

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.349 
content that you can expect to see
there's<00:01:02.430> going<00:01:02.670> to<00:01:02.760> be<00:01:02.789> more<00:01:03.000> YouTube

don't<00:01:34.350> think<00:01:34.439> that<00:01:34.799> you<00:01:34.890> can<00:01:34.920> learn<00:01:35.250> just<00:01:35.549> by

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
don't think that you can learn just by

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
don't think that you can learn just by
watching<00:01:36.000> video<00:01:36.479> or<00:01:36.780> just<00:01:36.840> by<00:01:37.170> reading<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.560> book

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
watching video or just by reading a book

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.219 
watching video or just by reading a book
you<00:01:38.250> really<00:01:38.549> have<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:39.030> bang<00:01:39.630> it<00:01:39.659> out<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.110> the

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
you really have to bang it out on the

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:43.100 
you really have to bang it out on the
keyboard<00:01:40.650> in<00:01:40.799> practice<00:01:41.479> make<00:01:42.479> mistakes<00:01:42.960> and

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
keyboard in practice make mistakes and

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.440 
keyboard in practice make mistakes and
run<00:01:43.290> into<00:01:43.439> walls<00:01:43.939> get<00:01:44.939> through<00:01:45.329> those

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
run into walls get through those

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.510 
run into walls get through those
obstacles<00:01:45.840> because<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.649> way<00:01:46.860> it<00:01:47.159> really

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
obstacles because that way it really

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.340 
obstacles because that way it really
really<00:01:47.970> leaves<00:01:48.240> an<00:01:48.420> impression<00:01:48.540> in<00:01:48.899> your<00:01:49.110> head

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
really leaves an impression in your head

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.740 
really leaves an impression in your head
and<00:01:49.530> it<00:01:50.159> really<00:01:50.460> makes<00:01:50.700> you<00:01:50.850> understand<00:01:51.390> why

that<00:01:55.079> you<00:01:55.170> were<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.820> so<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.880> grow<00:01:57.210> from<00:01:57.810> every

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
that you were and so you grow from every

those<00:02:00.930> live<00:02:01.110> coding<00:02:01.409> sessions<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.100> terms<00:02:02.340> of

those live coding sessions in terms of

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.450 
those live coding sessions in terms of
the<00:02:02.579> format<00:02:03.000> I'm<00:02:03.210> thinking<00:02:03.740> we<00:02:04.740> may<00:02:04.950> take<00:02:05.189> a

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
the format I'm thinking we may take a

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.219 
the format I'm thinking we may take a
code<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.880> Chris<00:02:06.090> tutorial<00:02:06.540> or<00:02:06.630> we<00:02:06.840> may<00:02:06.990> take

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
code with Chris tutorial or we may take

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.410 
code with Chris tutorial or we may take
someone<00:02:08.190> else's<00:02:08.489> tutorial<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.149> we'll<00:02:09.300> go

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
someone else's tutorial and we'll go

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.270 
someone else's tutorial and we'll go
through<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:09.660> together

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
through it together

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.120 
through it together
and<00:02:10.399> that<00:02:11.240> way<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.450> get<00:02:11.720> exposed<00:02:12.170> to<00:02:12.319> all<00:02:12.830> of
