00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.620
 12 

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.620
 but 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.109
 when we want to see a starting point he 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.230
 there is always a train hiding another 

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:19.210
 our train but I know that when 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.289
 I was 12 years old and the revolution 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:28.570
 groison 56 broke out that I saw some 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:31.599
 dead and young young man killed 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.000
 I was in touch with some 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:40.239
 thing that has torn me both 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.750
 exceeded and 1 g health the grace of life 

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:47.380
 an extraordinary power of life 

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:49.989
 and that I am I must be at the service 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.570
 of this life and that not only 

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.200
 enjoy life but that I have a 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:01:00.219
 duty to this life that is still 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:04.049
 in me and I wanted to sacrifice this life 

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:06.939
 with the revolutionaries at 12 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.950
 doing lots of things against 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:11.740
 Russians who arrived to crush him 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:13.659
 this revolution and this is where my 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:20.079
 grandfather who was a publisher and a 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:23.369
 tall wise man told me about grown up and 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:27.399
 beyond the satyagraha of nonviolence 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:29.469
 and to enter in itself through this 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.329
 suffering that I have to have lost 

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:39.369
 cousins ​​of the uncles who were all killed 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:41.369
 and Burundi neighbors finally Thursday the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:45.249
 encounter with death was absolutely 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:48.359
 determining to look for others 

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:53.229
 values ​​than to please that to acquire that 

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:55.029
 than to dominate and that's for sure I was 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:56.409
 taken from liberty and until today 

00:01:55.029 --> 00:01:59.439
 know 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.159
 what interests me the most is to be 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:07.349
 free ideologies of free d 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:10.209
 impregnation politico religious etc 

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:13.569
 I would like to walk on my own path 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:16.269
 you have to throw yourself like that on the open sea 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:19.269
 and is risky his life in ten beautiful years 

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:23.650
 but I 'm going to the new I do not want to 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:25.510
 entrust my life to someone or a priest 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:29.739
 I really like the plates I am 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.000
 orthodox but I have but I prefer 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:34.239
 go down months 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.230
 good I ask for advice maybe but I 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.140
 will go down months and was looking for 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.860
 this decision does not give joy and 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.799
 freedom 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:46.810
 if it does not give joy and 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:48.640
 freedom a verticality 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.920
 it's not a good decision I have to 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.819
 look for the other answer and that was 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:57.549
 a struggle difficult to give no 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.739
 only obey the requests of others 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.930
 whether it is the parents that it is the 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:05.230
 society be it church whatever it is 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.959
 but dare to market on my way and if 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.459
 I dare to say dug my way which is in 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:12.819
 healthy 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:14.500
 it's the one who forgives himself and in the 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.319
 medicine I have nothing the origin of the 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.959
 sickness it's not sorry I do not speak 

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.910
 do not forgive and I do not forgive 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:25.900
 someone that 's the oblige of the 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.359
 sickness the first step towards good 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.419
 health is forgiveness second is the 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:33.549
 gratitude to thank everything 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:36.160
 who had arrived because like that 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:40.150
 it's constructive what happened 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.700
 third one day a joy the health 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:43.389
 it's joy so you'll tell me where are you 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:46.930
 you'll die 

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:49.569
 a part of me from mougins never one 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.419
 can pollinate the world leaves by the 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:54.669
 joy but it's a joy as we go 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:56.620
 to say without cause because it's not at 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:59.950
 because an object that I play is the 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:02.440
 time we do not feel in prison we did not 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.079
 no need to issue and so people 

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:07.060
 settle in their prison in 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.070
 buying sofas by buying 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.530
 swimming pools of frigos beautiful 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:12.709
 voice 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.840
 he thinks that's their life 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.910
 discover one day that we are in a 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.930
 prison and how can we 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
 get out of prison 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:24.350
 it is only downhill in itself 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.360
 in an intimacy in a reflection and 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:29.060
 the dragon is what is the world 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.130
 it's seduction by all kinds of 

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:33.050
 This buys his ax and it you need 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.230
 I know what you need 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:38.830
 no I have to dig what I have women 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:38.830
 in point 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:51.610
 but
