00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so let me show you how to set it up it's

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.130 
so let me show you how to set it up it's
pretty<00:00:33.540> simple<00:00:33.900> on<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:36.150> wire<00:00:36.360> they<00:00:36.660> give<00:00:36.930> you

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
pretty simple on the wire they give you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.069 
pretty simple on the wire they give you
there's<00:00:37.530> three<00:00:37.860> wires<00:00:38.300> there's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> white<00:00:39.660> wire

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
there's three wires there's a white wire

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.740 
there's three wires there's a white wire
which<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.400> audio<00:00:41.760> there's<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> yellow<00:00:42.450> on

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
which is your audio there's a yellow on

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.350 
which is your audio there's a yellow on
a<00:00:42.780> black<00:00:43.080> if<00:00:43.680> you<00:00:44.220> look<00:00:44.430> on<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.730> transmitter

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
a black if you look on your transmitter

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.940 
a black if you look on your transmitter
here<00:00:46.010> you<00:00:47.010> have<00:00:47.900> the<00:00:48.900> bottom<00:00:49.230> one<00:00:49.380> is<00:00:49.560> your

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
here you have the bottom one is your

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.250 
here you have the bottom one is your
power<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:50.880> you're<00:00:51.180> powering<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.900> and<00:00:52.110> then

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
power if you're powering it and then

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.570 
power if you're powering it and then
there's<00:00:52.410> a<00:00:52.470> ground<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.190> then<00:00:53.280> there's<00:00:53.490> a

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:53.580 
there's a ground and then there's a

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.020 
there's a ground and then there's a
video<00:00:54.210> so<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:55.440> yellow<00:00:55.710> wire<00:00:56.040> goes<00:00:56.070> to<00:00:56.460> video

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
video so the yellow wire goes to video

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.680 
video so the yellow wire goes to video
the<00:00:57.480> black<00:00:57.720> goes<00:00:58.200> to<00:00:58.230> ground<00:00:59.270> the<00:01:00.270> white<00:01:00.480> will

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
the black goes to ground the white will

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.360 
the black goes to ground the white will
be<00:01:00.810> used<00:01:01.020> for<00:01:01.200> audio<00:01:01.320> if<00:01:01.740> you<00:01:01.830> want<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.070> record

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
be used for audio if you want to record

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.840 
be used for audio if you want to record
audio<00:01:02.490> if<00:01:02.880> you're<00:01:03.060> just<00:01:03.270> doing<00:01:04.430> video<00:01:05.430> you're

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
audio if you're just doing video you're

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.609 
audio if you're just doing video you're
going<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.030> do<00:01:06.330> yellow<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:06.810> video<00:01:07.140> black<00:01:07.439> to

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
going to do yellow to video black to

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.100 
going to do yellow to video black to
ground<00:01:08.210> what<00:01:09.210> you're<00:01:09.390> going<00:01:09.509> to<00:01:09.570> need<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> do

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
ground what you're going to need to do

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.219 
ground what you're going to need to do
is<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:10.950> GoPro<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> recognize<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.780> cable

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
is for the GoPro to recognize the cable

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.840 
is for the GoPro to recognize the cable
to<00:01:13.500> make<00:01:13.590> this<00:01:13.799> work<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> I<00:01:14.310> think<00:01:14.549> this<00:01:14.670> is

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
to make this work and I think this is

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.880 
to make this work and I think this is
where<00:01:14.999> people<00:01:15.270> might<00:01:15.390> be<00:01:15.509> having<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.840> problem

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
where people might be having a problem

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.499 
where people might be having a problem
the<00:01:16.890> wire<00:01:17.130> has<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.429> be<00:01:17.670> plugged<00:01:18.060> into<00:01:18.299> the

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
the wire has to be plugged into the

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.919 
the wire has to be plugged into the
GoPro<00:01:18.960> before<00:01:19.409> you<00:01:19.530> turn<00:01:19.770> the<00:01:19.890> camera<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.280> so

00:01:20.919 --> 00:01:20.929 
GoPro before you turn the camera on so

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:22.940 
GoPro before you turn the camera on so
we're<00:01:21.929> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.079> put<00:01:22.469> that<00:01:22.619> in<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:22.920> like

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
we're going to put that in there like

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.760 
we're going to put that in there like
that<00:01:23.630> and<00:01:24.630> what<00:01:24.869> we're<00:01:25.020> going<00:01:25.109> to<00:01:25.200> do<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> we're

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
that and what we're going to do is we're

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.020 
that and what we're going to do is we're
going<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.100> power<00:01:26.999> the<00:01:27.869> transmitter<00:01:28.590> with<00:01:29.280> my

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
going to power the transmitter with my

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.940 
going to power the transmitter with my
three<00:01:30.359> cell<00:01:30.810> battery<00:01:31.200> you're<00:01:31.740> going<00:01:31.890> to

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
three cell battery you're going to

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.289 
three cell battery you're going to
notice<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.399> plug<00:01:32.640> this<00:01:32.819> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> light

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
notice when I plug this in the light

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:37.730 
notice when I plug this in the light
comes<00:01:33.539> on<00:01:35.630> so<00:01:36.630> now<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.869> have<00:01:37.140> power<00:01:37.409> to<00:01:37.499> my

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
comes on so now I have power to my

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.219 
comes on so now I have power to my
transmitter<00:01:38.509> then<00:01:39.509> I'm<00:01:39.630> going<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.869> turn<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.109> my

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
transmitter then I'm going to turn on my

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.590 
transmitter then I'm going to turn on my
goggles<00:01:40.889> and<00:01:41.069> you'll<00:01:41.219> hear<00:01:41.369> a<00:01:41.399> beep<00:01:41.609> plug<00:01:42.450> in

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
goggles and you'll hear a beep plug in

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.550 
goggles and you'll hear a beep plug in
the<00:01:42.689> battery

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:48.560
