it has apparently superior low-light
performance<00:01:00.989> now<00:01:01.530> we're<00:01:01.620> going<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> try<00:01:02.010> the

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
performance now we're going to try the

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.690 
performance now we're going to try the
actual<00:01:02.550> webcam<00:01:03.000> later<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.799> for<00:01:05.100> now<00:01:05.159> we're

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
actual webcam later but for now we're

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070 
actual webcam later but for now we're
just<00:01:05.729> going<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> have<00:01:06.240> a<00:01:06.270> look<00:01:06.479> at<00:01:06.600> this<00:01:06.780> thing

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
just going to have a look at this thing

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.859 
just going to have a look at this thing
so<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.680> mean<00:01:08.340> the<00:01:08.490> killer<00:01:08.729> app<00:01:09.030> is<00:01:09.299> going<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.720> be

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
so I mean the killer app is going to be

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.580 
so I mean the killer app is going to be
that<00:01:10.229> it's<00:01:10.380> motorized<00:01:10.860> right<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.810> one<00:01:12.810> concern

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
that it's motorized right so one concern

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.160 
that it's motorized right so one concern
that<00:01:13.890> I<00:01:13.920> had<00:01:14.340> when<00:01:14.670> I<00:01:14.729> first<00:01:14.820> saw<00:01:15.420> it<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.869> that

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
that I had when I first saw it is that

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.490 
that I had when I first saw it is that
yeah<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.619> get<00:01:17.159> that<00:01:17.549> motorized<00:01:18.500> performance

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
yeah you get that motorized performance

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.850 
yeah you get that motorized performance
but<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.549> also<00:01:21.020> have<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.049> deal<00:01:22.229> with<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.710> being

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
but you also have to deal with it being

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.710 
but you also have to deal with it being
quite<00:01:23.280> large<00:01:23.729> like<00:01:24.030> it's<00:01:24.180> not<00:01:24.330> something

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
quite large like it's not something

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.090 
quite large like it's not something
you're<00:01:24.840> realistically<00:01:25.439> here's<00:01:25.710> an<00:01:25.799> iphone

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you're realistically here's an iphone

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.219 
you're realistically here's an iphone
four<00:01:26.369> scales<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.850> camera<00:01:27.119> man's<00:01:27.299> iphone<00:01:27.659> it's

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
four scales the camera man's iphone it's

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
four scales the camera man's iphone it's
not<00:01:28.470> something<00:01:28.890> that<00:01:28.920> you're<00:01:29.130> realistically

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
not something that you're realistically

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.840 
not something that you're realistically
going<00:01:30.240> to<00:01:30.360> be<00:01:30.540> using<00:01:31.200> on<00:01:31.590> a<00:01:31.619> laptop<00:01:32.009> okay<00:01:32.790> so

software<00:01:52.040> okay<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.399> go<00:01:53.430> this<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.850> the

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
software okay here we go this is the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.490 
software okay here we go this is the
driver<00:01:54.360> and<00:01:54.540> software<00:01:54.689> installation<00:01:55.380> and

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
driver and software installation and

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.170 
driver and software installation and
ready<00:01:55.649> for<00:01:55.860> windows<00:01:56.100> XP<00:01:56.219> or<00:01:56.490> vista<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:56.969> almost

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
ready for windows XP or vista and almost

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
ready for windows XP or vista and almost
anything<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.719> works<00:01:57.869> on<00:01:58.049> vista<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.560> going<00:01:58.710> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
anything that works on vista is going to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.819 
anything that works on vista is going to
work<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.130> windows<00:02:00.060> 7<00:02:00.299> so<00:02:00.960> it<00:02:01.079> uses<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.469> standard

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
work on windows 7 so it uses a standard

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.469 
work on windows 7 so it uses a standard
USB<00:02:03.950> power<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.340> data<00:02:05.549> cable<00:02:06.060> here<00:02:06.299> it's

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
USB power and data cable here it's

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.169 
USB power and data cable here it's
actually<00:02:06.840> quite<00:02:07.020> long<00:02:07.829> so<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.310> have<00:02:08.580> pretty

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
actually quite long so you have pretty

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.580 
actually quite long so you have pretty
good<00:02:09.360> flexibility<00:02:10.020> in<00:02:10.200> terms

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
good flexibility in terms

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.979 
good flexibility in terms
of<00:02:10.679> where<00:02:11.250> you'd<00:02:11.489> like<00:02:11.670> to<00:02:11.730> mount<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.390> and<00:02:12.540> I

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
of where you'd like to mount it and I

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.720 
of where you'd like to mount it and I
guess<00:02:13.230> that's<00:02:13.470> pretty<00:02:13.709> much<00:02:13.920> all<00:02:14.129> we<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.519> say

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:14.730 
guess that's pretty much all we can say

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:17.479 
guess that's pretty much all we can say
about<00:02:14.879> it<00:02:15.060> for<00:02:15.450> now<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:16.379> can<00:02:16.890> sort<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.340> play

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:17.489 
about it for now you can sort of play

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.100 
about it for now you can sort of play
around<00:02:17.790> with<00:02:18.030> the<00:02:18.209> mounting<00:02:18.599> system<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.930> little

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
around with the mounting system a little

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.390 
around with the mounting system a little
bit<00:02:19.230> here<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.470> can<00:02:19.620> see<00:02:19.800> it's<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.980> little<00:02:20.010> loose

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
bit here you can see it's a little loose

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.009 
bit here you can see it's a little loose
right<00:02:20.670> now<00:02:20.849> but<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.360> is<00:02:21.540> apparently<00:02:21.930> going

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
right now but this is apparently going

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:24.710 
right now but this is apparently going
to<00:02:22.200> adjust<00:02:22.530> both<00:02:23.160> up<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.790> down<00:02:23.879> as<00:02:24.330> well<00:02:24.569> as

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
to adjust both up and down as well as

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.509 
to adjust both up and down as well as
side<00:02:24.989> to<00:02:25.200> side<00:02:25.410> and<00:02:25.709> I'm<00:02:25.830> definitely<00:02:26.040> going<00:02:26.430> to

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
side to side and I'm definitely going to

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.070 
side to side and I'm definitely going to
have<00:02:26.610> to<00:02:26.730> do<00:02:26.849> a<00:02:26.879> video<00:02:27.030> later<00:02:27.390> showing<00:02:27.780> exactly

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
have to do a video later showing exactly

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.360 
have to do a video later showing exactly
how<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.349> works<00:02:28.650> but<00:02:28.799> thank<00:02:29.099> you<00:02:29.220> for

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
how that works but thank you for

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.580 
how that works but thank you for
