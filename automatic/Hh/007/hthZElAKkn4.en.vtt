00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.790
 Hello friends of passion as are the 

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.729
 today we are going to change the sensor 

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.740
 of oxygen number 2 to this place law 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:12.670
 that can also appear in your 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:15.089
 scales as sensor 1 bank 2 in this 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.089
 case we see 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.500
 that the sensor hit but we can see 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.970
 then simply the key 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.000
 to be rotating 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:35.790
 so here you have to disconnect 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.460
 all this part we realize behind 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.260
 of this capita well the connector 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.660
 it's very simple the truth is that 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.970
 you just have to disconnect it where 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:51.510
 come here and remove it connect it from 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.510
 This parts 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.610
 you are pie 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.610
 and disconnect 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.240
 very well once we have removed 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.470
 absolutely all the staples that 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.820
 hold this insert 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 we can realize that we can 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 download and here we have the connector of the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.880
 sensor normally compute this 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.880
 part to disconnect 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.149
 and how do we see when it's in front 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.900
 with violence so that we leave what 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:38.250
 is now replacing it 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.619
 very good and since we have the sensor there 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 than replace it we do not always recommend 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.450
 use original pieces friends that the 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.490
 true that the cheap afterwards it is expensive 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.280
 but even if they are in a row and 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.219
 you know or say that one of the faults 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 of an oxygen sensor is 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:57.719
 that starts spending more gas 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.850
 begins to spend more gas the car to 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.270
 the best starts to backfire maybe 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:02.270
 starts 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:10.980
 you do not have explosions from the exhaust 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.980
 but this is what we are going to put 

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:13.980
 new 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:21.800
 and ready and ready friends we put it 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.120
 nothing else we would need to erase the 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:27.290
 code because the safest thing is that it does not 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.160
 He knows how to approach the code, he is only sensor 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.320
 95 and original 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.740
 well there we can see how it is on 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.390
 the saddle in this case to erase the 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.730
 code we're going to use the application for 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.740
 torque 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.670
 if we go to 

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:46.200
 [Music] 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.200
 start looking for mistakes 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.069
 [Music] 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.010
 and once he finished seeing the mistakes 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.890
 we can see that there appears the 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:02.680
 code that says 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:05.150
 white oxygen sensor 2 we give you 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.590
 in options 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:08.590
 which is in the part of up here 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:14.329
 and see photos with echo 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.380
 even where the check disappeared here 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.380
 is for less
