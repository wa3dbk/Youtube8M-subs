00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.149
 around him the crocodiles are 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.340
 they entertain with their recent dams 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:12.280
 some of the young hippos 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.589
 Adults seem curious they are not afraid 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.969
 of the crocodiles is almost as if 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.969
 they were making fun of them 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.950
 the dominant male nibbles at some 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.340
 crocodiles that are feeding on their 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.340
 path 

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:46.380
 to be sure that they receive the 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.380
 message does it again 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.730
 but the hippopotamus does not go after 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:00.400
 crocodile goes after the zebra that the 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.200
 crocodile is eating 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.600
 although they are vegetarians they can be 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:07.980
 carnivores especially when there is meat 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.980
 cool right in front of you 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.130
 but this is a behavior 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.479
 extremely rare and never before 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 been captured on film 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.270
 the crocodile knows that this bravado 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.070
 giant can beat him easily is 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.110
 better to give up dinner than to engage 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.110
 in a battle that can not win 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.270
 usually the hippos kill 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.630
 other animals in fits of fury not 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.910
 for food but no hippopotamus will pass 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.860
 of the rare luxury of red meat although 

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.650
 means using brute force to 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.110
 get it meat is not a part 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:57.980
 essential to your diet but it is obvious that a 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.980
 they like 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.270
 soon other hippos join the 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.270
 picnic
