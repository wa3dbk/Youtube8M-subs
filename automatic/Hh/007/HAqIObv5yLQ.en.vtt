for<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.320> to<00:01:06.500> show<00:01:06.530> zero<00:01:10.330> now<00:01:11.330> so<00:01:11.480> I'll<00:01:11.570> turn

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
for it to show zero now so I'll turn

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.670 
for it to show zero now so I'll turn
your<00:01:12.890> measurement<00:01:13.370> on<00:01:14.170> this<00:01:15.170> will<00:01:15.380> help<00:01:15.560> you

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
your measurement on this will help you

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.600 
your measurement on this will help you
do<00:01:15.830> your<00:01:15.980> cam<00:01:16.190> math<00:01:17.800> insert<00:01:18.800> the<00:01:18.950> spring<00:01:19.340> make

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
do your cam math insert the spring make

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.520 
do your cam math insert the spring make
sure<00:01:19.790> it's<00:01:20.000> centered<00:01:20.300> and<00:01:20.690> not<00:01:20.870> going<00:01:21.140> to<00:01:21.290> fly

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
sure it's centered and not going to fly

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.500 
sure it's centered and not going to fly
off<00:01:21.770> anywhere<00:01:22.190> because<00:01:22.580> we<00:01:23.060> don't<00:01:23.240> want<00:01:23.390> to

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:23.510 
off anywhere because we don't want to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:32.940 
off anywhere because we don't want to
lose<00:01:23.660> an<00:01:23.810> eye

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.520 

yeah<00:01:33.520> back<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.180> off<00:01:34.299> once<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:34.750> get<00:01:34.900> to<00:01:35.049> one<00:01:35.229> so

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
yeah back it off once you get to one so

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.190 
yeah back it off once you get to one so
you<00:01:35.650> can<00:01:35.740> zero<00:01:36.070> everything<00:01:36.460> out<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.960> we're

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
you can zero everything out and we're

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:51.350 
you can zero everything out and we're
ready<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.500> test

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.750 

look<00:01:51.960> at<00:01:52.050> that<00:01:52.470> barely<00:01:53.190> did<00:01:53.340> anything<00:01:53.370> I'm

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:53.760 
look at that barely did anything I'm

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.780 
look at that barely did anything I'm
already<00:01:53.910> past<00:01:54.150> 200<00:01:55.490> if<00:01:56.490> you're<00:01:56.670> doing

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
already past 200 if you're doing

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.450 
already past 200 if you're doing
repetition<00:01:57.660> with<00:01:58.440> multiple<00:01:58.860> Springs<00:01:59.220> there

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
repetition with multiple Springs there

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.640 
repetition with multiple Springs there
is<00:01:59.580> a<00:01:59.610> stop<00:01:59.940> back<00:02:00.150> here<00:02:00.480> we<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.470> measure

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
is a stop back here we can measure

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.590 
is a stop back here we can measure
multiple<00:02:02.310> Springs<00:02:02.970> and<00:02:03.210> make<00:02:03.300> sure<00:02:03.450> they're

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
multiple Springs and make sure they're

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.300 
multiple Springs and make sure they're
all<00:02:03.750> within<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.920> same<00:02:05.160> general<00:02:05.550> vicinity<00:02:07.310> and
