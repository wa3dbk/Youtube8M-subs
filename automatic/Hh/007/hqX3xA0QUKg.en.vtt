I<00:00:00.079> love<00:00:01.079> a<00:00:01.110> builder<00:00:01.530> and<00:00:01.979> then<00:00:02.280> we<00:00:02.550> we<00:00:03.240> sort<00:00:03.480> of

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
I love a builder and then we we sort of

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.210 
I love a builder and then we we sort of
cereal<00:00:03.959> which<00:00:04.170> was<00:00:04.290> either<00:00:04.440> Superman<00:00:05.040> or

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
cereal which was either Superman or

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.460

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
Batman or Flash Gordon and I think

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.780 
Batman or Flash Gordon and I think
probably<00:00:07.620> run<00:00:08.099> about<00:00:08.130> that<00:00:08.490> same<00:00:08.760> time

probably run about that same time

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.480 
probably run about that same time
because<00:00:09.480> we<00:00:09.690> are<00:00:09.809> the<00:00:09.990> same<00:00:10.170> age<00:00:10.380> George<00:00:10.980> Lucas

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490
