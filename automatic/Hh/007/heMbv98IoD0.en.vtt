00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.319
 Tell me guys, I'll make a short video. 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:11.519
 about the operation of audi q3 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:19.369
 I'm going to call today 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:19.369
 the car here so you can watch 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:35.090
 the whole team and I'm here watching the 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.370
 digital television running 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.760
 It's all key to steering the people. 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.570
 Press once again the gps gps appears 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.460
 touch screen 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:47.030
 you can look up any address 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:56.090
 and it shows you the map of the running 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:58.730
 very good, once again, chaviano 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.500
 We're moving again now. 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.260
 apple tv 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.950
 This is so cool, this is where it is. 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.590
 switching of a good interface 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:12.500
 multimedia that your iphone uses with 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:15.740
 apple tv and you can control this 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 here you can see is the protection of 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 I had the screen I have in the car 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 You can for example go back and press here 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:27.200
 the smaller it will appear the smaller and you 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.630
 use I had exactly as you use it 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.760
 na at 1 at home on home tv 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.950
 you can put the videos from the 

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:35.229
 youtube do search all routed in 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.880
 your mobile phone 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.190
 neel cooler if different than it has 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.030
 for the car that I use the most is that I 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.820
 I can use my mirror of mine. 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.619
 cell phone in car land 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.720
 So for example if I want to here is the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:55.000
 I click on apple tv 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.890
 I'll show you play apple tv 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.350
 ground mirroring so far 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:05.240
 It looks like there if I want to. 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:06.830
 is for example a video on YouTube you just 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.060
 give the play 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.310
 the video is rolling here i can 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.230
 including good that the land and the video are 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.750
 Rolling, finding it strange, you're listening. 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.010
 the music of the pagoda and watching the 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.320
 american hip hop 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:20.180
 This is exactly what is cooler. 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.959
 you can for example instead of using 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.019
 a clip 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.850
 you can put is 11 a presentation 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:26.450
 Your picture and you do when you do not 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.120
 cell phone 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.850
 What's interesting this is common is 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.770
 the multimedia key in the car I'm 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.930
 here listening radio 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.490
 but I 'm seeing multimedia because I 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:39.710
 I already saw the steering wheel. 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:45.550
 for example heard the multimedia sound near 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.550
 and media and take control everything in the steering wheel 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:54.470
 I can take the picture only with the 

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:00.350
 sound open here all the steering wheel remembering 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:04.040
 that 's tight it showed up right there 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.370
 press once more he turns the camera 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.370
 back 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:12.740
 one more time gps television 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:14.690
 back to the media called 5 

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.910
 tinkering is intuitive 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.970
 you can is if you do not want to wait 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.160
 even in this I think even cooler is 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.760
 example provoke will the experiment 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.760
 from the earth 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:33.980
 I'm going to cancel I'm going to leave it alone in the team. 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:36.440
 Taxi car already original and even made the sound 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.540
 I was seeing but if I want to 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:43.060
 example only heard the sound I go here in the sound 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:47.210
 It's rolling and I click on apple tv. 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:49.880
 There the sound is rolling and now if I leave 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.530
 from here and start watching something else 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.160
 use my cell phone it keeps rolling 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.110
 The sound that my cell phone rings but I 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:00.680
 I can do other things like 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:04.420
 example enter facebook enter 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:07.100
 asep anything it keeps rolling 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.420
 on the screen even lock the phone 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.790
 Touch 

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:12.440
 forget the phone there is 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.340
 watching my dvd 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:18.710
 that there just be bikes and river that 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:21.320

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.340
 thing that only being dead does and that 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.340
 leaves the euro car keepers 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.800
