00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
monthly budget wedding flower fix so for

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.830 
monthly budget wedding flower fix so for
January<00:00:11.730> I<00:00:11.849> thought<00:00:12.059> we'd<00:00:12.210> try<00:00:12.360> something<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
January I thought we'd try something a

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.959 
January I thought we'd try something a
little<00:00:12.870> different<00:00:13.080> stray<00:00:14.070> away<00:00:14.190> from<00:00:14.309> flowers

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
little different stray away from flowers

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.330 
little different stray away from flowers
and<00:00:15.299> winter<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.410> really<00:00:16.740> good<00:00:16.890> time<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.220> try

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
and winter is a really good time to try

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.070 
and winter is a really good time to try
to<00:00:17.430> do<00:00:17.609> that<00:00:17.789> because<00:00:18.060> a<00:00:18.270> lot<00:00:18.570> of<00:00:18.600> the<00:00:18.750> flowers

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
to do that because a lot of the flowers

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.920 
to do that because a lot of the flowers
are<00:00:19.199> more<00:00:19.350> expensive<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:20.039> time<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.460> year<00:00:20.930> so

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
are more expensive this time of year so

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.420 
are more expensive this time of year so
what<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.230> did<00:00:22.380> was<00:00:22.439> something<00:00:22.890> with<00:00:23.010> curly

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
what we did was something with curly

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.040 
what we did was something with curly
willow<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.000> there's<00:00:24.390> a<00:00:24.480> lot<00:00:24.660> of<00:00:24.689> different

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
willow and there's a lot of different

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.660 
willow and there's a lot of different
types<00:00:25.199> of<00:00:25.350> willow<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.220> cool<00:00:26.460> but

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
types of willow that are really cool but

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.519 
types of willow that are really cool but
I<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.240> way<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.630> curly<00:00:28.019> willow<00:00:28.170> looks

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
I like the way this curly willow looks

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.330 
I like the way this curly willow looks
there's<00:00:28.800> also<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:30.300> willow<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:31.340> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
there's also on willow and a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.580 
there's also on willow and a
couple<00:00:32.820> other<00:00:33.090> types<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:33.989> can't<00:00:34.290> think<00:00:34.440> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
couple other types that I can't think of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.770 
couple other types that I can't think of
off<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.040> top<00:00:35.130> of<00:00:35.340> my<00:00:35.460> head<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.000> the<00:00:36.450> curly

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
off the top of my head but the curly

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.450 
off the top of my head but the curly
willow<00:00:36.930> really<00:00:37.350> looks<00:00:37.559> nice<00:00:37.770> for<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.100> winter

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
willow really looks nice for a winter

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.180 
willow really looks nice for a winter
themed<00:00:39.030> centerpiece<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.649> was<00:00:40.890> five

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
themed centerpiece and this was five

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.190 
themed centerpiece and this was five
dollars<00:00:41.730> for<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.180> bunch<00:00:42.420> at<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> grocery<00:00:43.170> store

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
dollars for a bunch at the grocery store

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.529 
dollars for a bunch at the grocery store
and<00:00:43.649> five<00:00:43.980> dollars<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.550> certainly<00:00:45.180> enough<00:00:45.510> to

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and five dollars is certainly enough to

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.490 
and five dollars is certainly enough to
cover<00:00:45.809> one<00:00:46.170> centerpiece<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:49.020> coming

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
cover one centerpiece and then coming

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.170 
cover one centerpiece and then coming
down<00:00:49.530> into<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> main<00:00:50.399> part<00:00:50.430> of<00:00:50.879> the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
down into the main part of the

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.130 
down into the main part of the
centerpiece<00:00:51.719> we<00:00:52.289> used<00:00:52.590> potpourri<00:00:53.460> to<00:00:54.390> fill

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
centerpiece we used potpourri to fill

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.830 
centerpiece we used potpourri to fill
this<00:00:55.440> hurricane<00:00:56.129> base<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.510> pill<00:00:57.660> free

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
this hurricane base and the pill free

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.810 
this hurricane base and the pill free
does<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> really<00:00:58.289> good<00:00:58.530> job<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:59.100> filling<00:00:59.579> the

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
does a really good job of filling the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.000 
does a really good job of filling the
room<00:00:59.969> with<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.390> aroma<00:01:00.719> that<00:01:01.170> flowers<00:01:01.770> would

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
room with the aroma that flowers would

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.830 
room with the aroma that flowers would
have<00:01:02.219> done<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.699> since<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.510> not<00:01:03.600> using

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
have done and since we're not using

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.990 
have done and since we're not using
flowers<00:01:04.650> this<00:01:04.890> will<00:01:05.040> do<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.189> good<00:01:05.400> job<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
flowers this will do a good job of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.500 
flowers this will do a good job of
replacing<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:07.110> and<00:01:08.100> this<00:01:08.790> potpourri<00:01:09.150> was

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
replacing that and this potpourri was

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.570 
replacing that and this potpourri was
eight<00:01:09.810> dollars<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:10.530> craft<00:01:10.770> store<00:01:10.920> but<00:01:11.400> I

that and then the last the vase that's
holding<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.590> all<00:02:22.680> together<00:02:22.890> is<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.340> hurricane

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
holding it all together is a hurricane

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.820 
holding it all together is a hurricane
base<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.660> this<00:02:24.960> tend<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.290> be<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.410> little<00:02:25.590> less

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
base and this tend to be a little less

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.000 
base and this tend to be a little less
expensive<00:02:26.490> than<00:02:26.520> other<00:02:27.060> vases<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.710> are<00:02:28.710> more

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
dramatic and around this size you'd

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.420 
dramatic and around this size you'd
probably<00:02:32.490> get<00:02:32.850> a<00:02:33.060> standard<00:02:33.810> base<00:02:34.160> this<00:02:35.160> size

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
probably get a standard base this size

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.699 
probably get a standard base this size
for<00:02:35.730> around<00:02:35.970> ten<00:02:36.270> dollars<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.410> hurricane
