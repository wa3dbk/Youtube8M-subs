00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
we introduced induction technology

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.830 
we introduced induction technology
almost<00:01:10.680> by<00:01:10.920> accident<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:12.090> had<00:01:12.210> never<00:01:12.450> heard<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
almost by accident we had never heard of

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
talked to about induction had never

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.789 
talked to about induction had never
heard<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:20.969> it<00:01:21.210> but<00:01:21.600> I've<00:01:21.689> ever<00:01:21.840> even<00:01:22.049> seen<00:01:22.170> a

heard of it but I've ever even seen a

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.490 
heard of it but I've ever even seen a
light<00:01:23.539> so<00:01:24.539> don't<00:01:24.750> feel<00:01:24.930> bad<00:01:24.960> if<00:01:25.170> you're<00:01:25.380> in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
exciting things about the technology we

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.999 
exciting things about the technology we
get<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.479> opportunity<00:01:31.109> to<00:01:31.140> bring<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> foot<00:01:31.859> to

years so we really need your help on
this<00:01:55.979> one

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
this one

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.789 
this one
and<00:01:56.490> get<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.030> word<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.439> so<00:01:58.439> what's<00:01:58.679> so

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
and get the word out so what's so

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.859 
and get the word out so what's so
special<00:01:58.829> by<00:01:59.310> the<00:01:59.369> iGrow<00:01:59.729> induction<00:02:00.329> and<00:02:00.509> why

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
special by the iGrow induction and why

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.090 
special by the iGrow induction and why
have<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.140> spent<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.499> last<00:02:01.530> three<00:02:01.950> years

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
have we spent the last three years

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.249 
have we spent the last three years
working<00:02:02.280> on<00:02:02.549> it<00:02:02.759> it's<00:02:03.659> actually<00:02:03.869> pretty

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
working on it it's actually pretty

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:07.219 
working on it it's actually pretty
simple<00:02:04.549> it<00:02:05.549> lasts<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.969> hundred<00:02:06.479> thousand<00:02:06.929> hours

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
simple it lasts a hundred thousand hours

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:09.109 
simple it lasts a hundred thousand hours
that's<00:02:07.530> about<00:02:07.799> twenty<00:02:08.369> years<00:02:08.520> worth<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.910> white

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that's about twenty years worth of white

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.230 
that's about twenty years worth of white
and<00:02:09.420> about<00:02:10.050> ten<00:02:10.470> times<00:02:10.770> longer<00:02:11.039> than<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.880> HID

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
and about ten times longer than the HID

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.110 
and about ten times longer than the HID
lights<00:02:12.660> you're<00:02:12.870> currently<00:02:13.230> using<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:14.730> uses

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
lights you're currently using it uses

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.110

really very little electricity 1.6 amps

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.610 
really very little electricity 1.6 amps
that's<00:02:18.810> about<00:02:19.020> three

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
that's about three

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.530 
that's about three
times<00:02:19.769> less<00:02:20.099> and<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.519> thousand<00:02:21.030> why<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.150> hid

you<00:02:21.840> using<00:02:22.290> and<00:02:22.610> it<00:02:23.610> gives<00:02:23.790> us<00:02:23.940> very<00:02:24.060> little

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
you using and it gives us very little

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.140 
you using and it gives us very little
heat<00:02:24.810> we<00:02:25.769> can<00:02:25.950> actually<00:02:26.220> touch<00:02:26.670> a<00:02:26.700> fall<00:02:27.120> on

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
your wild wipe off with our hands and if

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.880 
your wild wipe off with our hands and if
that<00:02:30.299> wasn't<00:02:30.659> good<00:02:30.780> enough<00:02:30.810> it<00:02:31.470> was<00:02:31.620> invented

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
that wasn't good enough it was invented

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.039 
that wasn't good enough it was invented

been in use for 100 years we loved all
that<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.769> next<00:02:41.099> step<00:02:41.310> was<00:02:41.519> see<00:02:41.819> if<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.269> could

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
that the next step was see if we could

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:43.940 
that the next step was see if we could
tune<00:02:42.690> this<00:02:42.900> light<00:02:43.140> technology<00:02:43.500> for

tune this light technology for

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.270 
tune this light technology for
agriculture<00:02:44.780> because<00:02:45.780> if<00:02:46.079> we<00:02:46.200> could<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:47.129> would

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
agriculture because if we could it would

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.100 
agriculture because if we could it would
be<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.489> most<00:02:47.640> promising<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:48.629> important
