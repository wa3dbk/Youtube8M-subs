00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
and but basically in just like in the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.840 
and but basically in just like in the
background<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.860> is<00:00:44.010> me<00:00:44.129> playing<00:00:44.280> career

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
background this is me playing career

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.040 
background this is me playing career
mode<00:00:45.059> with<00:00:45.420> my<00:00:45.570> pro<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:47.360> what<00:00:48.360> happened<00:00:48.750> was

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
mode with my pro and what happened was

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.160 
mode with my pro and what happened was
the<00:00:49.590> ball<00:00:49.829> was<00:00:50.460> invisible<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.239> which<00:00:52.050> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
the ball was invisible and which you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.310 
the ball was invisible and which you
could<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.559> see<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.899> when<00:00:54.899> I<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.110> to<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
could probably see so when I got to the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.670 
could probably see so when I got to the
second<00:00:55.770> season<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.430> my<00:00:56.879> pro<00:00:57.120> and<00:00:57.559> basically<00:00:58.559> I

second season on my pro and basically I

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
was really frustrating and I researched

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.050 
was really frustrating and I researched
it<00:01:31.170> after<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> game<00:01:31.619> to<00:01:32.040> see<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.729> know<00:01:32.850> if<00:01:32.939> it

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
it after the game to see you know if it

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.550 
it after the game to see you know if it
was<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.210> me<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.659> are<00:01:33.720> people<00:01:33.960> had<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.409> well

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
was just me or are people had it as well

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.800 
was just me or are people had it as well
and<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.460> lot<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.670> people<00:01:36.090> had<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.390> well<00:01:36.600> and

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
and a lot of people had it as well and

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.539 
and a lot of people had it as well and
now<00:01:37.710> if<00:01:37.950> you<00:01:38.100> have<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.869> quick<00:01:39.869> fix

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:40.549 
now if you have this a quick fix

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:42.649 
now if you have this a quick fix
hopefully<00:01:41.549> it's<00:01:41.670> fixed<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.030> his<00:01:42.119> patch<00:01:42.299> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
hopefully it's fixed in his patch it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.899 
hopefully it's fixed in his patch it
doesn't<00:01:43.020> say<00:01:43.170> is<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.619> hopefully<00:01:43.740> is<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.310> quick

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
doesn't say is but hopefully is a quick

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.429 
doesn't say is but hopefully is a quick
fix<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.329> pretty<00:01:45.600> much<00:01:45.689> just<00:01:45.869> go<00:01:46.049> change<00:01:46.350> your

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
fix is pretty much just go change your

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
fix is pretty much just go change your
ball<00:01:46.680> I'm<00:01:46.890> going<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> settings<00:01:48.060> change<00:01:48.420> the

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
ball I'm going to settings change the

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.550 
ball I'm going to settings change the
ball<00:01:48.750> that<00:01:48.930> you're<00:01:49.020> currently<00:01:49.140> using<00:01:49.320> to

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
ball that you're currently using to

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.440 
ball that you're currently using to
another<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.640> will<00:01:50.759> appear<00:01:50.790> again<00:01:51.090> and

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
another one and it will appear again and

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.569 
another one and it will appear again and
this<00:01:51.960> happens<00:01:52.320> mainly<00:01:52.740> in<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.130> second<00:01:53.460> season

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
this happens mainly in the second season

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.469 
this happens mainly in the second season
of<00:01:53.880> your<00:01:54.090> career<00:01:54.299> mode<00:01:55.009> but<00:01:56.009> other<00:01:56.159> than<00:01:56.310> that

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:56.479 
of your career mode but other than that

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.899 
of your career mode but other than that
since<00:01:57.479> since<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.560> changed<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:59.159> ball<00:01:59.310> it<00:01:59.579> hasn't

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
since since I changed the ball it hasn't

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.940 
since since I changed the ball it hasn't
happened<00:02:00.000> again<00:02:00.390> which<00:02:00.600> is<00:02:00.630> good<00:02:00.930> but<00:02:01.710> anyway

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
happened again which is good but anyway

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.440 
happened again which is good but anyway
let's<00:02:02.130> get<00:02:02.219> on<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.030> they've<00:02:03.210> actually

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
let's get on to what they've actually

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.170 
let's get on to what they've actually
fixed<00:02:04.110> in<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:04.500> title<00:02:04.740> update<00:02:04.920> today<00:02:05.250> so<00:02:05.969> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
fixed in this title update today so the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.449 
fixed in this title update today so the
first<00:02:06.329> thing<00:02:06.450> is<00:02:06.600> they've<00:02:06.979> improved<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.250> stale

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
first thing is they've improved a stale

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.619 
first thing is they've improved a stale
ability<00:02:08.910> across<00:02:09.300> all<00:02:09.509> online<00:02:09.899> game<00:02:10.530> modes<00:02:10.830> now

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
ability across all online game modes now

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.820 
ability across all online game modes now
obviously

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
obviously

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.680 
obviously
online<00:02:14.430> there's<00:02:14.730> been<00:02:14.850> a<00:02:14.880> lot<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> sort<00:02:15.450> of<00:02:15.540> you

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
online there's been a lot of sort of you

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.150 
online there's been a lot of sort of you
know<00:02:15.750> lag<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.560> things<00:02:16.800> like<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:16.980> so

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
know lag and things like that so

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.400 
know lag and things like that so
hopefully<00:02:17.820> you<00:02:18.150> know<00:02:18.240> it<00:02:18.420> it<00:02:18.900> runs<00:02:19.170> a<00:02:19.320> lot

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
hopefully you know it it runs a lot

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.820 
hopefully you know it it runs a lot
smoother<00:02:19.950> another<00:02:20.910> thing<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.180> they've<00:02:21.830> added

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
smoother another thing is they've added

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.100 
smoother another thing is they've added
stability<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.880> EA<00:02:24.120> sports<00:02:24.480> football<00:02:24.780> club

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
stability in the EA sports football club

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.250 
stability in the EA sports football club
challenges<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:25.890> so<00:02:26.880> hopefully<00:02:27.240> that's<00:02:27.510> good

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
challenges and so hopefully that's good

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.590 
challenges and so hopefully that's good
as<00:02:28.350> well<00:02:28.730> national<00:02:29.730> anthems<00:02:30.240> will<00:02:30.450> be

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:30.600 
as well national anthems will be

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.230 
as well national anthems will be
properly<00:02:31.050> synced<00:02:31.620> with<00:02:31.710> their<00:02:31.980> corresponding

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240 
properly synced with their corresponding

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.400 
properly synced with their corresponding
national<00:02:33.240> teams<00:02:33.450> now<00:02:33.960> I<00:02:33.990> didn't<00:02:34.290> actually

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
national teams now I didn't actually

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.800 
national teams now I didn't actually
come<00:02:34.680> across<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.220> but<00:02:36.030> that'd<00:02:36.450> be<00:02:36.480> kind<00:02:36.780> of

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
come across this but that'd be kind of

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.210 
come across this but that'd be kind of
funny<00:02:37.050> if<00:02:37.170> you<00:02:37.350> know<00:02:37.470> you've<00:02:37.650> got<00:02:37.680> like<00:02:37.920> a

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
funny if you know you've got like a

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.450 
funny if you know you've got like a
Brazil<00:02:38.730> demons<00:02:39.150> playing<00:02:39.420> the<00:02:39.540> England<00:02:39.900> anthem

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
Brazil demons playing the England anthem

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:43.490 
Brazil demons playing the England anthem
but<00:02:41.460> um<00:02:41.760> so<00:02:42.510> they've<00:02:42.630> also<00:02:42.810> added<00:02:43.110> stability

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
but um so they've also added stability

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310 
but um so they've also added stability
when<00:02:44.280> beginning<00:02:44.700> fifa<00:02:45.330> 13<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:45.930> when<00:02:46.050> you<00:02:46.140> just

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
when beginning fifa 13 so when you just

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.290 
when beginning fifa 13 so when you just
start<00:02:46.530> be<00:02:46.680> free<00:02:46.830> 13<00:02:47.250> and<00:02:47.520> it<00:02:47.970> started<00:02:48.270> to

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
start be free 13 and it started to

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.090 
start be free 13 and it started to
connect<00:02:48.690> when<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.470> starts<00:02:49.680> connect<00:02:49.920> through

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
connect when it starts connect through

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.680 
connect when it starts connect through
the<00:02:50.130> social<00:02:50.580> network<00:02:50.850> on<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.060> console<00:02:51.480> and

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
the social network on the console and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.630 
the social network on the console and
they've<00:02:52.350> added<00:02:52.800> more<00:02:52.920> stability<00:02:53.250> there

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
they've added more stability there

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.000 
they've added more stability there
obviously<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.120> probably<00:02:54.420> froze<00:02:54.720> or<00:02:54.959> something

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
obviously it probably froze or something

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.140 
obviously it probably froze or something
I've<00:02:56.010> been<00:02:56.040> getting<00:02:56.400> a<00:02:56.430> lot<00:02:56.520> of<00:02:56.580> freezes<00:02:57.060> on

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
I've been getting a lot of freezes on

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.960 
I've been getting a lot of freezes on
Fame<00:02:57.600> and<00:02:57.900> just<00:02:58.740> here<00:02:58.950> though<00:02:59.100> I<00:02:59.130> McCain<00:02:59.670> play

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
Fame and just here though I McCain play

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.630 
Fame and just here though I McCain play
the<00:03:00.750> only<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.380> only<00:03:01.650> thing<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.040> knew<00:03:02.250> when<00:03:02.610> I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
the only the only thing I knew when I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.430 
the only the only thing I knew when I
scored<00:03:03.120> was<00:03:03.390> when<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:03.720> ball<00:03:03.900> hit<00:03:04.140> the<00:03:04.260> net

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
scored was when the ball hit the net

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:06.740 
scored was when the ball hit the net
because<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:04.950> could<00:03:05.130> see<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:05.490> net<00:03:05.640> move<00:03:05.880> which

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
because I could see the net move which

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.510 
because I could see the net move which
was<00:03:06.900> kind<00:03:07.110> of<00:03:07.170> funny<00:03:07.380> because<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.950> didn't<00:03:08.400> know

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
was kind of funny because I didn't know

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.070 
was kind of funny because I didn't know
if<00:03:08.850> I<00:03:09.000> was<00:03:09.060> going<00:03:09.209> to<00:03:09.300> score<00:03:09.450> that<00:03:09.600> or<00:03:09.720> not<00:03:09.870> and

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
if I was going to score that or not and

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.330 
if I was going to score that or not and
I<00:03:10.170> got<00:03:10.320> quite<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.590> lot<00:03:10.740> of<00:03:10.830> achievements<00:03:11.250> in

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
I got quite a lot of achievements in

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.440 
I got quite a lot of achievements in
this<00:03:11.430> game<00:03:11.640> as<00:03:11.790> well<00:03:11.910> which<00:03:12.060> is<00:03:12.090> kind<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.390> funny

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
this game as well which is kind of funny

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.990 
this game as well which is kind of funny
but<00:03:13.320> another<00:03:13.860> thing<00:03:14.040> that<00:03:14.310> I<00:03:14.430> added<00:03:14.760> is

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
but another thing that I added is

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.390 
but another thing that I added is
they've<00:03:15.270> improved<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:16.020> up<00:03:16.380> they've<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.370> know

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
they've improved the up they've you know

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:20.300 
they've improved the up they've you know
optimize<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.480> searching<00:03:18.989> in<00:03:19.170> seasons<00:03:20.010> and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
optimize the searching in seasons and

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.040 
optimize the searching in seasons and
other<00:03:20.670> online<00:03:20.940> game<00:03:21.360> modes<00:03:21.570> so<00:03:21.690> that's<00:03:21.870> good

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
other online game modes so that's good

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.890 
other online game modes so that's good
hopefully<00:03:22.320> it<00:03:22.680> maybe<00:03:23.280> that<00:03:23.519> means<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
hopefully it maybe that means that you

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.330 
hopefully it maybe that means that you
could<00:03:25.019> get<00:03:25.080> in<00:03:25.230> the<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.410> know<00:03:25.590> the<00:03:25.739> right<00:03:25.950> sort

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340
