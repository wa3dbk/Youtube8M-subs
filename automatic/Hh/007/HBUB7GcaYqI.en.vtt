00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:08.519
 19-21 the second so today's topic our 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.950
 tactics training is the opening of the game 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.570
 from the chain of four and in the first place 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.269
 opening the chain 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.430
 positions defenseman one third 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.500
 the full back and continue playing 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.410
 on offense midfield or on the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.060
 Outside starting situation is that 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.800
 we have ball possession in the four-chain 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.359
 that we have the ball through the chain of four 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.820
 to rotate over the 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.099
 fullback in the advantage of again 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.930
 That's the classic situation 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.030
 We played the balls and always 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.680
 put back in a position than as 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.510
 defender that as playable and on 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.730
 are that means playing situation 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.219
 parties alluded to the defender 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.739
 principles corresponding position of 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.360
 out with a possibility has the 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.579
 can let both couples 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.739
 orient if he plays midfield 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:55.789
 can or if he gets under pressure then 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:59.430
 if necessary, a wide player opening 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.930
 if we can through the 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.850
 Four-string circulating arises 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.850
 Of course, the opponent a certain 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 movement and the feeds give that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 For example, we have such a game situation 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.920
 have that the opponent stands a scaffold 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:14.220
 and if we have the possibility 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:16.170
 quickly dub a position second 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.689
 defenders seek to play here 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.869
 can and then others can then 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.010
 the situations arise that we as 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:26.530
 outside defender to midfield to 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:28.990
 that we get started often 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.500
 even the corresponding counter 

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.240
 Partizan what we do not want to have and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.630
 this game situation arises with us 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.880
 Often he is an outside midfielder 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.320
 in this situation meets because 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.240
 that fits from the beginning already 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.320
 Closed because the room too 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.990
 is very compacted 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.440
 There are different ones in this situation 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.330
 options the full-back through 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.660
 opened the paths of the players 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:58.600
 get option number one is 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.430
 that outside midfielder himself 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.500
 inside that shifts us up 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.660
 have an open pass route this way 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.640
 and the full-back the possibility 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.050
 has run to it for a match 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.560
 to obtain 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.120
 this is a relatively risky one 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.230
 story because we have this whole 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.120
 open area 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.220
 the second option is the 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.040
 full back has got through the movement 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.470
 the outside player the outside player 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.430
 step on the last line of the 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.380
 defense has to be done accordingly 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.130
 must orientate some inner line 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.050
 cover 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.360
 but we really have a clear one here 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:36.550
 win situation and the fullback 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.800
 must be able to get one 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.150
 to look for a central attack that is 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.269
 ten or 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.440
 want to stand against central support com 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.239
 be played 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.040
 in this game situation has the 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.930
 outbreak sacred two options 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.300
 he has the possibility of a deep 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.220
 claim to be on the outside 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.709
 midfielder on the last 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.890
 line or he is playing 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:03.220
 center towards the 10th 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:04.360
 Both melt and then melt 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.980
 creates a completely new 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.440
 playing situation by a 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.420
 changed angles create large gaps 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.610
 in the enemy defense and we 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.290
 can be here in this area either 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.269
 be quick and direct through the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.280
 seamless set play or even play 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:20.680
 Situations arise that we 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.870
 the number on the defender other 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.760
 Things can happen without that 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:26.319
 defender his defensive position 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:29.580
 that means we keep the 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.580
 stability and pretend
