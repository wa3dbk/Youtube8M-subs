example you want to Google Maps you can
get<00:04:29.360> there<00:04:29.540> but<00:04:29.690> online<00:04:30.020> I<00:04:30.320> remember<00:04:30.950> right

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
get there but online I remember right

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:32.850 
get there but online I remember right
now<00:04:31.070> I<00:04:31.190> don't<00:04:31.310> have<00:04:31.460> any<00:04:31.610> connection<00:04:32.000> so<00:04:32.150> sure

now I don't have any connection so sure

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:39.460 
now I don't have any connection so sure
but<00:04:33.860> it<00:04:34.040> works<00:04:35.710> so<00:04:36.710> somehow<00:04:37.400> the<00:04:38.150> if<00:04:38.780> the<00:04:39.169> phone

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:39.470 
but it works so somehow the if the phone

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:42.250 
but it works so somehow the if the phone
sends<00:04:40.130> a<00:04:40.340> signal<00:04:40.910> to<00:04:41.150> the<00:04:41.270> television<00:04:41.990> when

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
sends a signal to the television when

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.590 
sends a signal to the television when
it's<00:04:42.440> on<00:04:42.560> the<00:04:42.590> UI<00:04:42.889> and<00:04:43.310> whenever<00:04:43.600> an

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
it's on the UI and whenever an

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.260 
it's on the UI and whenever an
application<00:04:45.080> executes<00:04:45.650> then<00:04:46.490> it<00:04:46.610> goes<00:04:46.729> full

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
application executes then it goes full

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:54.010
