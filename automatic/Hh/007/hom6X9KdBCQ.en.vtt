that<00:00:41.050> I've<00:00:41.199> been<00:00:41.530> growing<00:00:41.739> traffic<00:00:42.190> on<00:00:42.640> the

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
that I've been growing traffic on the

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.009 
that I've been growing traffic on the
cletus's<00:00:43.480> farm<00:00:43.780> and<00:00:44.730> it<00:00:45.730> seems<00:00:46.089> that<00:00:46.239> if<00:00:46.570> you

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
cletus's farm and it seems that if you

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.530 
cletus's farm and it seems that if you
don't<00:00:47.350> harvest<00:00:47.799> the<00:00:48.010> traffics<00:00:48.519> in<00:00:48.820> a

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
don't harvest the traffics in a

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.109 
don't harvest the traffics in a
reasonable<00:00:50.049> time<00:00:50.190> then<00:00:51.190> they<00:00:51.460> all<00:00:51.729> sort<00:00:52.030> of

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:52.119 
reasonable time then they all sort of

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:54.750 
reasonable time then they all sort of
wilt<00:00:52.420> away<00:00:52.570> and<00:00:52.839> die<00:00:53.049> which<00:00:53.559> I've<00:00:54.309> never<00:00:54.549> seen

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:54.760 
wilt away and die which I've never seen

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.189 
wilt away and die which I've never seen
for<00:00:54.970> now<00:00:55.059> I<00:00:55.119> don't<00:00:55.210> know<00:00:55.449> if<00:00:55.510> this<00:00:55.600> happens<00:00:56.049> I'm

00:00:56.189 --> 00:00:56.199 
for now I don't know if this happens I'm

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.719 
for now I don't know if this happens I'm
not<00:00:56.379> all<00:00:56.589> of<00:00:56.769> the<00:00:56.830> crops<00:00:57.100> or<00:00:57.339> not<00:00:58.979> so<00:00:59.979> I<00:01:00.010> kind<00:01:00.699> of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
not all of the crops or not so I kind of

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.189 
not all of the crops or not so I kind of
replicated<00:01:01.239> it<00:01:01.330> here<00:01:01.510> just<00:01:01.750> for<00:01:01.809> the<00:01:01.900> purpose

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
replicated it here just for the purpose

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:03.929 
replicated it here just for the purpose
of<00:01:02.229> this<00:01:02.290> video's<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:02.979> what<00:01:03.699> actually

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:03.939 
of this video's and what actually

00:01:03.939 --> 00:01:05.580 
of this video's and what actually
happens<00:01:04.180> is<00:01:04.269> when<00:01:04.420> you<00:01:04.510> harvest<00:01:04.750> it<00:01:05.140> you<00:01:05.409> don't

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
happens is when you harvest it you don't

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.530 
happens is when you harvest it you don't
get<00:01:05.680> anything<00:01:06.040> so<00:01:06.760> with<00:01:06.909> traffic<00:01:07.030> you

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
get anything so with traffic you

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:10.050 
get anything so with traffic you
normally<00:01:07.840> get<00:01:07.960> just<00:01:08.290> XP<00:01:08.680> you<00:01:09.340> get<00:01:09.460> about<00:01:09.640> I've

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:10.060

and<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.730> know<00:02:15.850> the<00:02:16.030> tamaco<00:02:16.540> should<00:02:16.960> have

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
and you know the tamaco should have

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:23.640 
and you know the tamaco should have
given<00:02:17.320> us<00:02:18.480> 75<00:02:19.480> cash<00:02:20.080> and<00:02:20.380> 20<00:02:21.070> XP<00:02:21.640> so<00:02:22.650> obviously

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
given us 75 cash and 20 XP so obviously

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.040 
given us 75 cash and 20 XP so obviously
it<00:02:23.770> seems<00:02:24.040> guys<00:02:24.340> that<00:02:24.670> if<00:02:24.820> you<00:02:25.030> plant<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.810> crop

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
it seems guys that if you plant the crop

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.650 
it seems guys that if you plant the crop
and<00:02:26.320> it's<00:02:26.770> it<00:02:27.520> completes<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.240> you<00:02:28.360> don't

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
and it's it completes and you don't

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.860 
and it's it completes and you don't
harvest<00:02:29.080> it<00:02:29.260> within<00:02:29.440> a<00:02:29.590> 24-hour<00:02:30.310> period<00:02:30.870> then

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
harvest it within a 24-hour period then

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.810 
harvest it within a 24-hour period then
it<00:02:31.990> will<00:02:32.140> wilt<00:02:32.410> and<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.890> will<00:02:33.040> lose<00:02:33.190> all<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
it will wilt and you will lose all the
