00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.620
 It is divided today that there is a folding type and now 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.620
 If you are installing 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.619
 One for 600 yen 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.730
 file is 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.579
 The road is clearly gag in the corner and this is coming to the left 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.660
 about it 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.610
 2gb September is the national weight of night so don't get it wrong 

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.250
 Please be so 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.870
 I'm a folding cinder, but please keep in mind 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.990
 It is only this that you lose 

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:49.320
 This is the same as when restoring 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.320
 I will report to the point 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.940
 Full return Fujii is full 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.410
 It is a merit of scale but this can be folded 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.619
 I like people who can fold in a certain amount 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.780
 The rice movement is also smooth 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.659
 Just send it with your finger lightly at 9:00 pm 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.010
 It is thanks to the shield bearing that it is opened smoothly 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.009
 Well there is a special bearing in the dumplings 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.700
 It is usually a laugh what kind of pedal 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.700
 To say that 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 It is this to see 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.280
 This is commonly used by general prefecture sports people 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.250
 But I will try to video 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.250
 This kind of movement only 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.580
 To another 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.580
 I think the pedal is a light movement 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.290
 Lightly without burdening your feet 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.440
 I was able to go around 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.530
 Movement is smooth, so better kick cycling 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:05.530
 Will be able to enjoy 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.110
 Yes it is installation from now 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.130
 Installation is attached here and pay attention to the first hexagon 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.780
 We believe in LCD display 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.269
 home 

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:35.619
 Finally 

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:38.619
 The period is extreme 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:44.150
 This is complete
