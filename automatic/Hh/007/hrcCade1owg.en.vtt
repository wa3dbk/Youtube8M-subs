00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:07.560
 in his first conference as a player 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.139
 I heard the Ecuadorian joao flyer 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.059
 reds recognized that between morelia and cross 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.670
 blue there are big differences and that 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.460
 surely here in the machine will feel 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.830
 more pressure and should be sacrificed more in 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.900
 search for a model title 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.910
 but I think there's a lot of difference there 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:30.890
 the institution then I think for me 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:33.260
 it's a big step to get to blue acro is 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:35.090
 done now is not missing the hardest thing that 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.160
 is to excel 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.380
 and as I say with the confidence that gives me 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.080
 the teacher my partner the directive and the 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.120
 swollen that the most important thing I think that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.400
 if it's not going to be a big step my 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.120
 career I think it puts more pressure on 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.120
 that there was morelia 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.290
 more sacrifices what everything is 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.840
 I think that in all of that I think that a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.920
 little more the highest level here and you have to 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.839
 take advantage of all that 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.170
 Blue cross had the opportunity but 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:10.200
 I think that again it was not given but 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:13.290
 same I come as it is in my name of 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.390
 and to get a degree here in mexico and 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:19.120
 who already bought crazy maple blue not me 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:22.740
 It is very surprising that 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:27.610
 players with this ability 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:31.260
 16 years and if I know what I do a lot 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:31.260
 but there will be a reason not a reason 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.890
 after playing a couple of friendlies 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.320
 in the USA the machine returned to the city of 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.960
 Mexico where he will train until the next 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.549
 Wednesday as from Thursday 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.920
 will play the pachuca tournament cradle of 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.049
 Mexican soccer on the campus 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.330
 maintains without news the theme of teo 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.250
 gutiérrez who must remain in the 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.619
 team even though the player himself 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.479
 He said he had the option of going to the river 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.240
 plate the player has trained with 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:02.880
 normality these days such as the chaco 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 giménez whose subject is in we will see because 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.610
 If you get your naturalization letter 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.229
 before next Friday it could be 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.120
 registered as Mexican and so the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.190
 directive could look for a last 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.930
 foreign reinforcement in the city of 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.280
 Mexico with images of Luis Contreras 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.090
 with martín montes in line with 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.090
