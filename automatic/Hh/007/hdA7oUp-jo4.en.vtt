whether<00:02:59.280> we<00:03:00.280> call<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.579> big<00:03:00.760> walleye<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:02.519> would

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
whether we call the big walleye we would

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.309 
whether we call the big walleye we would
like<00:03:03.730> to<00:03:03.760> released<00:03:04.299> it<00:03:04.510> but<00:03:04.810> unfortunately

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:05.319 
like to released it but unfortunately

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.429 
like to released it but unfortunately
bleeding<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.400> we<00:03:06.579> kept<00:03:06.819> it<00:03:07.000> it's<00:03:07.989> better<00:03:08.170> to

00:03:08.429 --> 00:03:08.439 
bleeding and we kept it it's better to

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:10.890 
bleeding and we kept it it's better to
keep<00:03:08.890> something<00:03:09.159> I<00:03:09.579> guess<00:03:09.879> if<00:03:10.060> it's<00:03:10.569> bleeding

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
keep something I guess if it's bleeding

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.080 
keep something I guess if it's bleeding
a<00:03:10.989> bit<00:03:11.200> there's<00:03:11.920> no<00:03:12.069> sense<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.430> wasting<00:03:12.849> fish

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:13.090 
a bit there's no sense of wasting fish

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.910 
a bit there's no sense of wasting fish
so<00:03:13.420> it's<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:14.290> know<00:03:14.379> it's<00:03:14.560> gonna<00:03:14.680> get<00:03:14.890> a

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
so it's you know it's gonna get a

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.879 
so it's you know it's gonna get a
anyways<00:03:15.519> but<00:03:16.389> the<00:03:16.930> key<00:03:17.109> to<00:03:17.290> these<00:03:17.379> big<00:03:17.620> walleye

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
anyways but the key to these big walleye

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.399 
anyways but the key to these big walleye
are<00:03:18.310> is<00:03:18.700> you<00:03:19.090> know<00:03:19.180> what<00:03:19.389> you<00:03:19.540> just<00:03:19.720> you<00:03:19.840> gotta

00:03:20.399 --> 00:03:20.409 
are is you know what you just you gotta

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.369 
are is you know what you just you gotta
be<00:03:20.530> so<00:03:20.680> careful<00:03:21.069> with<00:03:21.129> them<00:03:21.370> and<00:03:22.170> just<00:03:23.170> little

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
be so careful with them and just little

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:24.660 
be so careful with them and just little
things<00:03:23.470> can<00:03:23.769> affect<00:03:23.920> them<00:03:24.280> and<00:03:24.400> the<00:03:24.489> quicker

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
things can affect them and the quicker

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.129 
things can affect them and the quicker
you<00:03:24.909> get<00:03:25.030> them<00:03:25.209> off<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.629> quicker<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.019> get

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:26.139 
you get them off the quicker you get

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.599 
you get them off the quicker you get
them<00:03:26.290> back<00:03:26.409> down<00:03:26.620> they<00:03:26.889> don't<00:03:27.040> stress<00:03:27.370> those

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
them back down they don't stress those

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:29.280 
them back down they don't stress those
so<00:03:27.909> so<00:03:28.299> what<00:03:28.450> would<00:03:28.599> that<00:03:28.659> that<00:03:28.959> we<00:03:29.049> fish<00:03:29.260> in

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
so so what would that that we fish in

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.629 
so so what would that that we fish in
here<00:03:29.530> I<00:03:29.560> think<00:03:29.709> I<00:03:29.920> dropped<00:03:30.099> her<00:03:30.280> boat<00:03:30.459> probably

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
here I think I dropped her boat probably

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:32.910 
here I think I dropped her boat probably
about<00:03:30.879> 20<00:03:31.180> feet<00:03:31.359> there<00:03:31.629> and<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:32.290> hit<00:03:32.409> bottom<00:03:32.620> and

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
about 20 feet there and I hit bottom and

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:35.339 
about 20 feet there and I hit bottom and
then<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:34.000> important<00:03:34.659> to<00:03:34.689> find<00:03:34.930> what<00:03:35.139> true

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:35.349 
then it's important to find what true

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:36.990 
then it's important to find what true
bottom<00:03:35.739> true<00:03:36.069> bottom<00:03:36.519> you'll<00:03:36.670> want<00:03:36.819> to<00:03:36.849> give

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
bottom true bottom you'll want to give

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.270 
bottom true bottom you'll want to give
it<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> few<00:03:37.329> jigs<00:03:37.629> and<00:03:37.930> what<00:03:38.769> happens<00:03:39.099> is

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
it a few jigs and what happens is

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.009 
it a few jigs and what happens is
there's<00:03:39.700> currents<00:03:40.120> here<00:03:40.269> and<00:03:40.540> there's<00:03:40.689> mister

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
there's currents here and there's mister

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.440 
there's currents here and there's mister
champs<00:03:41.349> flutter<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.859> sides<00:03:42.129> so<00:03:42.849> what<00:03:43.239> we

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
champs flutter to the sides so what we

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.539 
champs flutter to the sides so what we
call<00:03:43.689> true<00:03:43.900> bottom<00:03:44.349> is<00:03:44.560> is<00:03:44.799> when<00:03:45.400> you're

00:03:45.539 --> 00:03:45.549 
call true bottom is is when you're

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:48.059 
call true bottom is is when you're
actually<00:03:45.930> bringing<00:03:46.930> the<00:03:47.170> lure<00:03:47.349> back<00:03:47.680> to<00:03:47.949> the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 
actually bringing the lure back to the

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.089 
actually bringing the lure back to the
to<00:03:48.250> center<00:03:48.669> so<00:03:49.150> when<00:03:49.599> I<00:03:49.690> Jake<00:03:50.019> I<00:03:50.169> want<00:03:50.500> my<00:03:50.650> a<00:03:50.680> jig

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:51.099 
to center so when I Jake I want my a jig

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.339 
to center so when I Jake I want my a jig
to<00:03:51.280> stop<00:03:51.519> right<00:03:52.000> talk<00:03:52.510> about<00:03:52.720> one<00:03:52.900> inch<00:03:53.139> off

00:03:53.339 --> 00:03:53.349 
to stop right talk about one inch off

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.170 
to stop right talk about one inch off
the<00:03:53.379> bottom<00:03:53.560> every<00:03:54.340> now<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:54.760> then<00:03:54.849> it's<00:03:55.090> a

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:55.180 
the bottom every now and then it's a

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.849 
the bottom every now and then it's a
good<00:03:55.329> idea<00:03:55.449> just<00:03:55.690> to<00:03:55.900> hit<00:03:56.109> bottom<00:03:56.319> because<00:03:56.709> it

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
good idea just to hit bottom because it

00:03:56.859 --> 00:03:59.159 
good idea just to hit bottom because it
hits<00:03:57.040> the<00:03:57.160> bottom<00:03:57.340> it<00:03:57.639> stirs<00:03:57.940> up<00:03:58.150> the<00:03:58.209> mock<00:03:58.540> and

00:03:59.159 --> 00:03:59.169 
hits the bottom it stirs up the mock and

00:03:59.169 --> 00:04:01.770 
hits the bottom it stirs up the mock and
it<00:03:59.980> already<00:04:00.760> looks<00:04:00.940> like<00:04:01.150> a<00:04:01.180> wounded<00:04:01.540> bait

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
it already looks like a wounded bait

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:03.930 
it already looks like a wounded bait
fish<00:04:02.079> but<00:04:02.799> when<00:04:02.919> it's<00:04:03.069> turned<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.489> monk<00:04:03.760> and

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
fish but when it's turned up monk and

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:05.250 
fish but when it's turned up monk and
everything<00:04:04.180> else<00:04:04.329> that<00:04:04.449> triggers<00:04:04.989> walleye

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
everything else that triggers walleye

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.149 
everything else that triggers walleye
and<00:04:05.500> do<00:04:05.709> becoming<00:04:06.699> active<00:04:07.060> and<00:04:07.209> biting<00:04:07.510> soul

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:08.159 
and do becoming active and biting soul

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.170 
and do becoming active and biting soul
well<00:04:09.159> we've<00:04:09.340> already<00:04:09.489> having<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> few<00:04:09.940> on<00:04:10.060> the

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:10.180 
well we've already having a few on the
