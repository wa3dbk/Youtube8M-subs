00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.199 
least
so<00:03:28.170> a<00:03:28.200> sec<00:03:28.560> exact<00:03:28.830> of<00:03:29.010> primal<00:03:29.430> clash<00:03:29.520> is<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> mega

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
so a sec exact of primal clash is a mega

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:33.410 
so a sec exact of primal clash is a mega
I<00:03:30.360> run<00:03:30.630> how<00:03:31.410> does<00:03:31.620> endeavors<00:03:32.070> work<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.970> points

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
I run how does endeavors work as points

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.580 
I run how does endeavors work as points
I<00:03:34.040> think<00:03:35.040> the<00:03:35.100> same<00:03:35.430> as<00:03:35.550> in<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:35.730> yet<00:03:39.290> go<00:03:40.290> card

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
I think the same as in the yet go card

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.710 
I think the same as in the yet go card
one<00:03:41.489> two<00:03:41.700> or<00:03:41.820> three<00:03:42.170> one<00:03:43.170> two<00:03:44.209> so<00:03:45.209> my<00:03:45.360> second

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
one two or three one two so my second

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.680 
one two or three one two so my second
pack<00:03:45.900> contains<00:03:46.459> enough<00:03:47.930> much<00:03:50.690> chinchou

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
pack contains enough much chinchou

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.100 
pack contains enough much chinchou
chinchou

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
chinchou

00:03:54.110 --> 00:04:00.260 
chinchou
