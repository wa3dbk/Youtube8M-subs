00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
I'm gonna give you an equation of six

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.450 
I'm gonna give you an equation of six
hundred<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.690> forty<00:00:45.860> times<00:00:46.860> ten

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
hundred and forty times ten

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.220 
hundred and forty times ten
it<00:00:47.520> looks<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> this<00:00:48.149> alone<00:00:48.360> that's<00:00:48.660> really

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
you see six six hundred and forty we

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.939 
you see six six hundred and forty we
need<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.460> add<00:00:53.699> six<00:00:54.180> and<00:00:54.570> four<00:00:55.050> yeah<00:00:55.350> then<00:00:55.860> you

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
need to add six and four yeah then you

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:57.319 
need to add six and four yeah then you
just<00:00:56.129> thrown<00:00:56.309> away<00:00:56.399> beyond<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:56.879> zero<00:00:57.180> tonight

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
just thrown away beyond the zero tonight

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.110 
just thrown away beyond the zero tonight
you<00:00:57.539> got<00:00:57.690> ten<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.199> don't<00:00:58.410> add<00:00:58.649> ten<00:00:59.399> plus<00:00:59.820> ten

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
you got ten you don't add ten plus ten

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.740 
you got ten you don't add ten plus ten
equals<00:01:00.530> twenty<00:01:02.090> six<00:01:03.090> hundred<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.570> forty

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
equals twenty six hundred and forty

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.280 
equals twenty six hundred and forty
times<00:01:04.619> 10<00:01:05.129> equals<00:01:05.600> 20<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.840> guys<00:01:07.020> are<00:01:07.200> gonna

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
times 10 equals 20 you guys are gonna

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
times 10 equals 20 you guys are gonna
shock<00:01:07.830> your<00:01:08.040> teachers<00:01:08.549> well<00:01:08.790> when<00:01:08.970> you<00:01:09.060> show

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
them your math skills here's another one

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.130 
them your math skills here's another one
this<00:01:11.549> is<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.850> one<00:01:12.000> that<00:01:12.119> really<00:01:12.600> gets<00:01:13.020> people

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
this is the one that really gets people

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.270 
this is the one that really gets people
zero<00:01:13.920> times<00:01:14.880> zero<00:01:15.119> I<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:16.020> know<00:01:16.170> I<00:01:17.040> usually

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
zero times zero I know I know I usually

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.890 
zero times zero I know I know I usually
struggle<00:01:17.610> with<00:01:17.850> this<00:01:17.939> too<00:01:18.240> but<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:18.869> I

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
struggle with this too but then I

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.350 
struggle with this too but then I
realized<00:01:19.530> oh<00:01:19.799> this<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.280> really<00:01:20.549> simple<00:01:20.939> zero

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
realized oh this is really simple zero

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
realized oh this is really simple zero
times<00:01:22.290> zero<00:01:22.470> equals<00:01:23.659> double<00:01:24.659> zero<00:01:24.900> one<00:01:25.650> plus

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
times zero equals double zero one plus

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.120 
times zero equals double zero one plus
one<00:01:26.580> equals<00:01:27.420> eleven<00:01:27.900> and<00:01:28.020> then<00:01:28.170> you<00:01:28.380> get<00:01:28.619> two

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
one equals eleven and then you get two

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.780 
one equals eleven and then you get two
plus<00:01:29.790> two<00:01:30.090> equals<00:01:30.720> four<00:01:31.490> now<00:01:32.490> we're<00:01:32.700> doing

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
plus two equals four now we're doing

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.730 
plus two equals four now we're doing
English<00:01:33.060> I'm<00:01:33.630> gonna<00:01:33.810> be<00:01:33.960> teaching<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.530> some

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
use in like any piece of work you'll get

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.810 
use in like any piece of work you'll get
instant<00:01:39.840> a<00:01:40.049> plus<00:01:40.350> or<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.650> star<00:01:41.130> right<00:01:41.400> basically

instant a plus or a star right basically
just<00:01:42.509> copy<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.470> could<00:01:43.619> be<00:01:43.649> what<00:01:43.860> I<00:01:43.890> say<00:01:48.500> now

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
just copy just could be what I say now

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.530 
just copy just could be what I say now
you<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.950> memorize<00:01:50.130> that<00:01:50.579> go<00:01:50.880> back<00:01:51.149> if<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you could memorize that go back if you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.149 
you could memorize that go back if you
have<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:51.990> just<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.439> learn<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.040> then

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
have to just to learn that and then

00:01:53.159 --> 00:02:00.050 
have to just to learn that and then
there's<00:01:53.369> others<00:01:53.700> like<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:58.280> see<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.850> just

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
now now let's move on to science now as

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.450 
now now let's move on to science now as
you<00:02:11.450> can<00:02:11.570> see<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:12.170> have<00:02:12.290> two<00:02:12.560> glasses<00:02:12.770> of<00:02:13.220> water

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
you can see we have two glasses of water

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.960 
you can see we have two glasses of water
as<00:02:14.300> you<00:02:14.510> know<00:02:14.690> water<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.710> a<00:02:15.740> neutral<00:02:16.310> substance

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:16.970 
as you know water is a neutral substance

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:19.570 
as you know water is a neutral substance
but<00:02:17.480> together<00:02:17.800> together<00:02:18.800> they<00:02:19.340> make<00:02:19.550> a

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
but together together they make a
