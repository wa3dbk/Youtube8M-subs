00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.310
 For you, I have been evaluated for about 15 years 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.580
 interested in the relationship between the west and 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.380
 Russia in 1998, I have 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.880
 lucky enough to get russian 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.190
 my passport is double now 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.130
 citizenship constantly causes me 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 annoyance like the western press 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.720
 covers events related to Russia 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.850
 also regarding Russia and the West to me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.189
 hate biased attitude with 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.710
 which my fellow journalists write about 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.630
 the crisis in Ukraine from its very beginning in 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.110
 February 2014 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 it made me write a book 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.320
 Russophobia is a hostile attitude towards 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 Russia or Russian which is very 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 common in the west that is in the us and 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.469
 Europe in other regions of the world for example in 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.440
 China and Japan 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:48.870
 this phenomenon is not, I think Russophobia 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.760
 manifestations of racism and and the roots should 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.219
 look in the prejudices that have arisen 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.030
 even when splitting the church into catholic and 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.390
 Orthodox 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.980
 that's why my book is called 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 millennial war 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.670
 In addition, I would like to point out that this 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.860
 the split was initiated by the west they 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.590
 east we in the west blame 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.260
 in this split of the inhabitants of the east but it 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.299
 falsification of history split spawned 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 many prejudices above all 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.189
 against the Orthodox world against the Greeks 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.680
 and then after the fall of constantinople and 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.420
 against Russia since then stories 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.509
 travelers russian side 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.729
 hostile today 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.040
 Russophobia is observed mainly in the United States 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 similar trends are traced in 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:35.909
 America since 1945 in France Russophobia 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.909
 appeared in the late 18th century when in power 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.740
 was napoleon in england because of the struggle 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.750
 with Russia for control of Asia 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.170
 Russophobia has been strong for 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.829
 whole nineteenth century in germany 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.049
 Russophobia arose at the end 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.220
 nineteenth century when among the germans 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.409
 gained popularity 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.649
 idea of ​​living space in the east 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.200
 after the victory over nazism in 1945 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.020
 against Russia its former ally 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.030
 We began to actively advocate the United States as well as 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.600
 the British did it after defeating 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.729
 by napoleon in 1815 in america 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.890
 Russophobia is widespread today. 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.330
 day it was originally associated with 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.220
 struggle against communism 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.740
 however despite the collapse of the Soviet 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.170
 Union in the ninety-first year of Russophobia 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.540
 In the United States flared up again in the late 90s 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:23.370
 the beginning of the two thousandth's she 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.140
 manifested in two aspects in 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.000
 ideological basis of which 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.010
 serve the so-called struggle for 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.840
 democracy and human rights and in 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.360
 geopolitical because the Americans 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:35.640
 hate when other powers 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.230
 dispute their hegemony European Union 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.620
 is a complex formation 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.210
 faced with many difficulties 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.250
 especially in the last 15 years after 

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:47.280
 how did the eastern countries enter it 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.830
 Europe, but at the same time the European Union does not have its 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.110
 identities and recently joined 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.480
 states like poland romania 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.760
 the Baltic countries used to be closely 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.430
 associated with the Soviet Union and now how 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.380
 just need a new European 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.780
 self-awareness and recreation is really 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.140
 Indeed a complicated process but there is a simple 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.840
 output 

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:09.510
 come up with an enemy for myself that’s what I and 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:12.570
 I write in my book Russia plays a role 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.820
 ideal enemy for new members of the eu they 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.420
 denounced Russia as a hostile power 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.180
 Europe 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.830
 which of course is not true because of this 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.130
 they also enlisted support 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.230
 the US oil and arms lobby in its 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.760
 I tell the book about how from Russia 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.890
 artificially make the enemy 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.590
 to create as artificial 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.269
 European identity 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:35.880
 Western media can not be called objective 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.769
 Of course there are those who want to understand what 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.200
 what's really happening is who 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.030
 explains the Russian point of view but 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.760
 Most Western media whether 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.350
 print press television or radio in 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.910
 largely biased and adhere to 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.280
 anti-russian stance 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.110
 that's exactly what i'm trying to fix when 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:55.340
 help his college book 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.340
 avik his pain
