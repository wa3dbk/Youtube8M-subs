00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:11.460 
which makes it so much easier just in

hair<00:05:18.270> out<00:05:18.300> around<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> front<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.289> can<00:05:19.320> get<00:05:19.650> it

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
hair out around the front you can get it

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:22.550 
hair out around the front you can get it
to<00:05:19.949> look<00:05:20.070> natural<00:05:20.310> by<00:05:20.729> just<00:05:21.060> using<00:05:21.530> you<00:05:22.530> know

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
to look natural by just using you know

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.750 
to look natural by just using you know
the<00:05:22.889> fiber<00:05:23.220> of<00:05:23.520> the<00:05:23.699> lid<00:05:25.250> so<00:05:26.250> I'm<00:05:26.340> just<00:05:26.550> going

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
the fiber of the lid so I'm just going

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.260 
the fiber of the lid so I'm just going
around<00:05:27.000> and<00:05:27.599> just<00:05:27.810> taking<00:05:28.229> out<00:05:28.349> very<00:05:29.270> trying

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
around and just taking out very trying

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.089 
around and just taking out very trying
to<00:05:30.419> separate<00:05:30.900> it<00:05:31.050> out<00:05:31.199> I<00:05:31.440> guess<00:05:31.650> I<00:05:31.800> should<00:05:31.979> have

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:32.099 
to separate it out I guess I should have

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:33.589 
to separate it out I guess I should have
probably<00:05:32.250> separated<00:05:32.970> it<00:05:33.090> out<00:05:33.210> a<00:05:33.240> little<00:05:33.479> bit

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
probably separated it out a little bit

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:43.190 
probably separated it out a little bit
before<00:05:33.900> I<00:05:34.639> put<00:05:35.639> it<00:05:35.760> on<00:05:37.430> but<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.550> does<00:05:38.760> work

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:43.200 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:46.370 

and<00:05:43.770> the<00:05:43.860> wispy<00:05:44.220> hair<00:05:44.460> is<00:05:44.640> actually<00:05:45.380> pretty

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:46.380 
and the wispy hair is actually pretty

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.650 
and the wispy hair is actually pretty
you<00:05:46.710> know<00:05:46.830> it's<00:05:46.980> not<00:05:47.190> too<00:05:48.060> much<00:05:48.240> because<00:05:48.480> you

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
you know it's not too much because you

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.660 
you know it's not too much because you
know<00:05:48.780> sometimes<00:05:49.290> the<00:05:49.470> wispy<00:05:49.800> hair<00:05:50.010> can<00:05:50.280> be<00:05:50.310> too

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670 
know sometimes the wispy hair can be too

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:53.840 
know sometimes the wispy hair can be too
long<00:05:50.910> and<00:05:51.500> when<00:05:52.500> it's<00:05:52.650> too<00:05:52.920> long<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.670> looks

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:53.850 
long and when it's too long it looks

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:56.090 
long and when it's too long it looks
like<00:05:54.120> you<00:05:54.960> can't<00:05:55.200> really<00:05:55.350> tell<00:05:55.710> if<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:55.950> should

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
like you can't really tell if it should

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.830 
like you can't really tell if it should
have<00:05:56.250> been<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.400> bang<00:05:56.640> or<00:05:57.000> whether<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:57.450> wispy

00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:57.840 
have been a bang or whether it's wispy

00:05:57.840 --> 00:06:03.250 
have been a bang or whether it's wispy
hair<00:05:58.140> and<00:05:58.410> this<00:05:59.070> works<00:05:59.400> with<00:05:59.820> the<00:06:00.180> wispy<00:06:00.540> hair

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:03.260 

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:06.230 

now<00:06:04.260> I<00:06:04.290> think<00:06:04.500> this<00:06:04.950> one<00:06:05.220> is<00:06:05.250> cute<00:06:05.790> I<00:06:05.940> think

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
now I think this one is cute I think

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.590 
now I think this one is cute I think
she's<00:06:06.560> not<00:06:07.560> too<00:06:08.010> long<00:06:08.220> she's<00:06:08.760> not<00:06:08.940> too<00:06:09.180> short

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:09.600 
she's not too long she's not too short

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:12.230 
she's not too long she's not too short
she's<00:06:10.290> actually<00:06:10.590> a<00:06:11.010> comfortable<00:06:11.790> length<00:06:12.000> but

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
she's actually a comfortable length but

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.940 
she's actually a comfortable length but
before<00:06:12.600> I<00:06:12.630> go<00:06:12.780> for<00:06:13.020> it<00:06:13.140> i'm<00:06:13.320> just<00:06:13.560> gonna<00:06:13.680> grab

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:13.950 
before I go for it i'm just gonna grab

before I go for it i'm just gonna grab
my<00:06:14.010> measuring<00:06:14.790> tape<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.420> see<00:06:16.080> how<00:06:16.290> much

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:16.470 
my measuring tape and see how much

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.340 
my measuring tape and see how much
parting<00:06:16.980> space<00:06:17.310> we<00:06:17.550> have<00:06:17.790> now<00:06:18.750> the<00:06:18.870> parting

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:19.350 
parting space we have now the parting

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.290 
parting space we have now the parting
space<00:06:19.650> starts<00:06:20.340> right<00:06:20.760> here<00:06:22.670> so<00:06:23.670> with<00:06:23.850> this<00:06:23.880> one

00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:24.300 
space starts right here so with this one

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:27.890 
space starts right here so with this one
we're<00:06:24.630> getting<00:06:25.140> about<00:06:25.980> and<00:06:26.640> a<00:06:26.880> good<00:06:27.150> inch<00:06:27.480> and

00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:27.900 
we're getting about and a good inch and

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:30.530 
we're getting about and a good inch and
a<00:06:27.960> half<00:06:28.100> almost<00:06:29.100> two<00:06:29.460> inches<00:06:29.880> of<00:06:30.060> parting

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:30.540 
a half almost two inches of parting

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:35.060 
a half almost two inches of parting
space<00:06:30.840> right<00:06:31.170> along<00:06:31.470> in<00:06:31.620> front<00:06:33.290> and<00:06:34.290> our<00:06:34.680> curl

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:35.070 
space right along in front and our curl

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:37.520 
space right along in front and our curl
pattern<00:06:35.580> is<00:06:35.820> really<00:06:36.270> really<00:06:36.450> pretty<00:06:36.600> so<00:06:37.410> when

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:37.530 
pattern is really really pretty so when

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:39.080
