00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.870
 if you have a brand in recent years one 

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.240
 stormy development 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.820
 went through then it is what dacia 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.470
 and I remember in 2005 when it was logical 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.180
 then it all came to you like that 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.289
 We should have had it in western Europe 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.180
 with that car 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.320
 but then the mcv came a big one 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.860
 station wagon 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.129
 7 seats for very little money 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.570
 whole families became pigeon and even stronger 

00:00:30.129 --> 00:00:34.969
 Dacia has been in the Netherlands six times 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.730
 fandag organized whole fields full 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.539
 open mcv inflatables balloons it could 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.850
 none at all 

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:43.120
 And now it's your Logan MCV all the way 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.120
 updated 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.579
 I have to say those laurens from the field 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.129
 makes quick work of the dacia that are 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.329
 mouth that nose is pretty tough but 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.300
 first new mcv 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:01.550
 nicer than the last let it keep on 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.199
 less ugly 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.560
 however, the new mcv does not have one thing 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.610
 and that is two extra seats 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.890
 so you're not that popular anymore 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.360
 you want to become a football father then 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.409
 You will have to buy it and it costs 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.409
 another few thousand euros more 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.369
 ok so this is a 5st there but I have 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.149
 say for the money he remains a bug 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.149
 be space by 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.100
 where interiors are always there 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.630
 a single sausage 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.280
 as long as it is very much on the inside 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.380
 we can do very well because of that 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.869
 the endurance tests that we have 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.330
 but i have to say it is simple though 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.920
 or symbol care 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.319
 it looks a lot better than anything 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.569
 it used to be 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.569
 it is very simple you can easily find 

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:49.340
 what you need and yes you can do business 

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:51.319
 get it as a cruise control 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.530
 Also has leather upholstery is one 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:56.330
 louis had a second equipment level 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.819
 package does not cost you yet 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:00.200
 twelve hundred euros 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:01.849
 it is all just available 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.520
 You can also choose to get very cold 

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:07.629
 dacia logan mcv 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.770
 and then you will be ready in eleven 1990 euros 

00:02:07.629 --> 00:02:14.569
 do you have a tce90 and that tce90 mind you 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:16.519
 that's the new 3 cylinder turbo van 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.220
 renault and 900c 

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.090
 90 hp 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.500
 but you really know that 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.989
 It is important for Dacia that they do that 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.200
 can now offer a motorbike because on paper 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.150
 is that engine very economical and low CO2 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.520
 emissions means a Netherlands 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.170
 favorable prices and therefore you can 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.209
 car again so competitively priced are one 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.680
 some time ago 6 were suddenly not there 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.050
 more so cheap and that was because of that 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.940
 old engines with the thief in mind co2 

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.350
 emissions 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.900
 well this block k naturally awfully great 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.950
 good to the cleo, among other things 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800
 and it is actually an engine that 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.540
 connected to that logan mcv 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.220
 pushing nice forward naturally with none 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.160
 line but this car weighs 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.480
 only 11 pounds under 2000 rpm 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:56.900
 you have to give them a lot at home but the 

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.510
 above 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.819
 yes just fine thing he must say 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.370
 such a dacia you sit high the wheel can 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.780
 cannot be adjusted too extensively 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.390
 Those are all things that you missed back then 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.560
 we are what is flat on leather again 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.030
 On the other hand I have not 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.410
 sense of hatch would now go in one go 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.540
 southern france want to drive does that 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:16.610
 this old then again not up but he does 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.650
 it just all it is all over 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.630
 the right place the controls are normal 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.900
 very fair for certainly not 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:26.570
 artificial to not too direct but yes 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:29.660
 just fine for mom for this one 

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:32.000
 car is intended and that handling of 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.350
 such a logan mcv that for as your he does 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.390
 In this respect, also weather that 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.470
 big brother thinking and lodgy 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.060
 you can still quite with it 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.040
 turns he helps though about 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.870
 it just feels good to you 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.760
 can place old well 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.930
 you can go pretty fast on pace 

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.260
 a bend it really isn't like that 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:49.579
 right by our for whom you want to push 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:51.530
 the old one is a bit noisy 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:52.670
 my higher speeds you notice that there 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.859
 the bodywork are a bit ordinary 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.269
 gas is going to work well you have to tell him that 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:58.750
 charge 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:58.750
 I do not think so 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.549
 that 3 cylinder with 90 hp is immediately the 

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.379
 only gasoline engine that is in a logan mcv 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.230
 can get 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.030
 there would still be a change of the DC with 90 hp 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.659
 but there are no waiting 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.659
 so much to sell 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:16.880
 the engine is more advanced the design is 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.709
 better 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.299
 compared to its predecessor he 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:22.490
 actually has only one downside and that 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.199
 is the lack of 7 seats 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.850
 but who that while should only one 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:27.440
 a doctor or a lodgy buyer, they say 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.970
 at dacia 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:30.970
 and I can't get a pin in between 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:37.280
 and 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.900
 hey
