00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.130
 what they have to do but the head 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.599
 in the event of any problems, you are the person to solve them 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.900
 in this case you go to a new building with a colleague fitter 

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.669
 but computer cables must be installed for data traffic and 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.790

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:55.590
 have to have 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.100
 halfway through an assignment something suddenly changes and they have to look for it 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.970
 have time to understand not only the adjustment but also to the 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.610
 to be able to explain well to colleagues 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.370
 to be able to handle the responsibility for the work of others you have to be yourself 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.260
 first be a good mechanic so that you know exactly what you are talking about 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.640
 fellow technicians must be put to work

 keep an eye on the work by supervising it yourself 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.120
 as with insulting the cables

 that is responsible work in which you use the latest techniques 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.520
 the computer network was fully complete after this test, and there was more to it 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.770
