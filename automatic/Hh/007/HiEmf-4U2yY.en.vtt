00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 Hello, Sir, Welcome to the modest cuisine 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:16.160
 In this section we can consume more iftar ... 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.160
 we have a beautiful Ramadan dessert recipe 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.080
 "Iftar" 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.400
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.920
 1 piece of egg 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.160
 1 cup of yogurt 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 half pack of butter 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.520
 1 teacup of oil 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.160
 1 tbsp powdered sugar 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.520
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.520
 1 flick salt 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.080
 and as much flour as possible 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.280
 for sherbet; 2.5 cups of water 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.240
 2.5 cups of milk powder 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 and half lemon 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.760
 we have learned the ingredients for iftar curls 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760
 Let's start boiling sherbet 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.720
 first of all add sugar and water to the pot 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.680
 fuse 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.640
 Now let's add half a lemon 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.840
 Let's take 5 minutes after the boiling 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.200
 Let's start to knead the dough of our curd 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.480
 We have 1 egg 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.920
 No need to say that our eggs were washed, but we said 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 we broke our eggs 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.920
 1 cup of yogurt 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.600
 1 tea cup of sunflower oil 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:14.960
 we mix it in a little bit 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.080
 Now add the butter that we melt and cool down on 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.320
 1 tablespoon powdered sugar ... 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.960
 and 1 flick salt ... 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.960
 1 flick this salt 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.960
 we added 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.200
 after a little more mix now came 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:53.720
 Add baking powder on flour 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.040
 in the meantime, I would like you to use butter 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.280
 because the butter will give flavor 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:09.440
 now we are starting to knead by adding flour 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
 Our dough will be a little harder than normal 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.400
 now we're sprinkling some flour, putting it aside 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.800
 we are closing our container on the 15 minutes rest 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
 15 minutes later 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.160
 Let's take our dough now and let it bottom-up again 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.000
 and divide it into four parts 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.240
 let's do the biceps until each piece is finished 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:58.200
 now we are starting to open now 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.160
 will not be too big, will open up the serving plate 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.120
 so much 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.120
 now knurled roulette will cut into 8 triangular pieces 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.520
 we will wrap each piece blank 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.520
 this is our shape 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.760
 we also shaped the last dessert 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.040
 now we are giving to the oven in 185 degrees 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.240
 25 minutes later 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.080
 baked our curls in a 185 degree oven for about 25 minutes 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.640
 The color we want is this 

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.640
 we are now on our cold rolls 

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:05.560
 let's keep our sweet for 5 minutes. 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.680
 hold for at least 2 hours 

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.440
 2 hours later 

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:27.040
 Now, we're sprinkling coconut on it. 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.040
 as you can see, it's a pretty easy dessert 

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:34.640
 fasting 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:39.280
 No more service time 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:45.480
 it was a very nice and easy dessert 

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.720
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.720
 we shared a nice sherbet dessert recipe 

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:58.840
 "Iftar" 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:03.560
 I ask you to try and remember us every time in Ramadan 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.400
 goodbye...
