the cooking it at training tire now Adam

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
the cooking it at training tire now Adam
it<00:00:49.620> doesn't<00:00:49.950> matter<00:00:50.280> which<00:00:50.670> wheel<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.510> tire

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930

combination you put on your cooking edit
trainer<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:55.020> important<00:00:55.590> thing<00:00:55.620> is<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:55.980> keep

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
trainer the important thing is to keep

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.090 
trainer the important thing is to keep
that<00:00:56.789> combination<00:00:57.379> consistent<00:00:58.379> with<00:00:58.949> all

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
that combination consistent with all

that combination consistent with all
your<00:00:59.280> training<00:00:59.579> now<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.449> reason<00:01:00.719> for<00:01:01.020> that<00:01:01.050> is

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
your training now the reason for that is

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.410 
your training now the reason for that is
that<00:01:01.350> acts<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.039> a<00:01:02.100> benchmark<00:01:02.489> whenever<00:01:03.210> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
that acts as a benchmark whenever you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.420 
that acts as a benchmark whenever you
start<00:01:03.719> changing<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.470> type<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.710> wheel<00:01:05.040> tire

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
start changing the type of wheel tire

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.609 
start changing the type of wheel tire
combination<00:01:05.790> on<00:01:06.240> your<00:01:06.600> keuken<00:01:07.170> edit<00:01:07.350> trainer

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
combination on your keuken edit trainer

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.969 
combination on your keuken edit trainer
it'll<00:01:08.580> mean<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.299> your<00:01:09.840> power<00:01:10.260> curve<00:01:10.680> or

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it'll mean that your your power curve or

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.010 
it'll mean that your your power curve or
the<00:01:11.040> curve<00:01:11.400> or<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.640> resistance<00:01:12.210> will<00:01:12.659> change

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
the curve or the resistance will change

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.080 
the curve or the resistance will change
slightly<00:01:13.200> so<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.130> benchmarking<00:01:14.790> that<00:01:14.939> you're

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
slightly so the benchmarking that you're

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.880 
slightly so the benchmarking that you're
doing<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.450> your<00:01:15.540> keuken<00:01:15.900> edit<00:01:16.110> trainer<00:01:16.350> will

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
doing with your keuken edit trainer will

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.950 
doing with your keuken edit trainer will
obviously<00:01:17.189> change<00:01:17.400> as<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> change<00:01:18.420> your

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
obviously change as you change your

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
obviously change as you change your
wheel<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:20.070> with<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.280> calculator<00:01:20.759> trainer

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
wheel now with the calculator trainer

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.280 
wheel now with the calculator trainer
you're<00:01:21.299> able<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.600> benchmark<00:01:21.960> your

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
you're able to benchmark your

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.469 
you're able to benchmark your
performance<00:01:22.350> based<00:01:23.189> on<00:01:23.460> your<00:01:23.640> average<00:01:24.119> speed

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
performance based on your average speed

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.350 
performance based on your average speed
for<00:01:25.350> each<00:01:25.680> of<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.070> indoor<00:01:26.460> session<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.270> if

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
for each of your indoor session so if

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.179 
for each of your indoor session so if
you<00:01:27.479> change<00:01:27.900> your<00:01:28.020> will<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.950> going<00:01:29.159> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
you change your will it's going to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.910 
you change your will it's going to
change<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.939> variable<00:01:30.780> for<00:01:31.290> that<00:01:31.500> benchmark

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
change the variable for that benchmark

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.590 
change the variable for that benchmark
and<00:01:32.400> it'll<00:01:32.579> mean<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:32.939> it<00:01:33.030> won't<00:01:33.180> be<00:01:33.390> as

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
and it'll mean that it won't be as

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.840 
and it'll mean that it won't be as
accurate<00:01:34.340> against<00:01:35.340> your<00:01:35.490> normal

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
accurate against your normal

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.760 
accurate against your normal
benchmarking<00:01:36.509> now<00:01:37.020> does<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.350> wheel<00:01:37.500> make<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
benchmarking now does the wheel make a

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.800 
benchmarking now does the wheel make a
difference<00:01:38.159> yes<00:01:38.430> it<00:01:38.670> does<00:01:39.030> but<00:01:39.540> it's

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
difference yes it does but it's

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.810 
difference yes it does but it's
important<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:40.650> make<00:01:40.920> sure<00:01:40.950> that<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.490> keep<00:01:41.640> it

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
important to make sure that you keep it

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.730 
important to make sure that you keep it
consistent<00:01:42.180> so<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.079> you<00:01:43.200> keep<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.560> can

they'll<00:03:53.500> start<00:03:53.769> bouncing<00:03:54.190> around<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.000> the

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
loading yourself up for training you'll

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.230 
loading yourself up for training you'll
find<00:04:46.570> that<00:04:46.720> your<00:04:46.900> personal<00:04:47.140> bests<00:04:47.740> may<00:04:48.520> become

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
find that your personal bests may become

videos now after my last tip on corner

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:57.420 
videos now after my last tip on corner
and<00:05:55.330> I<00:05:55.539> got<00:05:56.139> an<00:05:56.229> email<00:05:56.469> from<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.919> person

00:05:57.420 --> 00:05:57.430 
and I got an email from a person

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.760 
and I got an email from a person
commenting<00:05:58.120> on<00:05:58.240> the<00:05:58.479> use<00:05:58.719> of<00:05:58.750> a<00:05:58.990> front<00:05:59.560> and

00:05:59.760 --> 00:05:59.770 
commenting on the use of a front and

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:02.999 
commenting on the use of a front and
rear<00:06:00.250> brake<00:06:00.610> so<00:06:01.210> my<00:06:01.360> recommendation<00:06:01.770> was<00:06:02.770> that

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:03.009 
rear brake so my recommendation was that

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:04.679 
rear brake so my recommendation was that
you<00:06:03.250> use<00:06:03.460> your<00:06:03.610> back<00:06:03.849> brake<00:06:04.150> when<00:06:04.389> you<00:06:04.509> got

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:04.689 
you use your back brake when you got

00:06:04.689 --> 00:06:07.230 
you use your back brake when you got
into<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.990> corner<00:06:05.439> but<00:06:06.219> in<00:06:06.490> conjunction<00:06:07.089> with

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
into the corner but in conjunction with

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.179 
into the corner but in conjunction with
that<00:06:07.479> you<00:06:07.750> can<00:06:08.080> use<00:06:08.289> your<00:06:08.409> front<00:06:08.740> and<00:06:08.919> rear

00:06:09.179 --> 00:06:09.189 
that you can use your front and rear

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:11.219 
that you can use your front and rear
brake<00:06:09.460> when<00:06:09.729> you're<00:06:09.849> coming<00:06:10.300> into<00:06:10.539> a<00:06:10.779> corner

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
brake when you're coming into a corner

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.529 
brake when you're coming into a corner
