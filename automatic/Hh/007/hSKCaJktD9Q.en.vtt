00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
mantle system so that when you're

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.210 
mantle system so that when you're
running<00:02:27.750> quickly<00:02:28.140> and<00:02:28.290> you<00:02:28.470> hit<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.650> wall<00:02:28.890> you

running quickly and you hit a wall you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.250 
running quickly and you hit a wall you
get<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.880> nice<00:02:30.060> boom<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.780> hit<00:02:30.960> it<00:02:31.080> and<00:02:31.170> you

get this nice boom you hit it and you

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.450 
get this nice boom you hit it and you
leap<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.650> you<00:02:31.710> go<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.340> maintain

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
leap and you go and you just maintain

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:34.160 
leap and you go and you just maintain
your<00:02:32.760> momentum<00:02:33.030> when<00:02:33.660> we<00:02:33.750> have<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.990> lean

your momentum when we have the lean

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.780 
your momentum when we have the lean
feature<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.740> allows<00:02:35.010> you<00:02:35.190> lean<00:02:35.370> out<00:02:35.400> and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
feature that allows you lean out and

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.520 
feature that allows you lean out and
lean<00:02:35.940> in<00:02:36.150> and<00:02:36.360> get<00:02:36.840> a<00:02:36.870> better<00:02:37.020> view<00:02:37.290> of<00:02:37.440> the

lean in and get a better view of the
battlefield<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.490> another<00:02:38.670> feature<00:02:38.910> that

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
battlefield so another feature that

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.150 
battlefield so another feature that
working<00:02:39.510> with<00:02:39.540> animation<00:02:40.080> is<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.230> slide<00:02:40.590> it

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
working with animation is the slide it

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.920 
working with animation is the slide it
allows<00:02:41.430> you<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:41.670> get<00:02:41.940> somewhere<00:02:42.270> quickly<00:02:42.540> get

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
allows you to get somewhere quickly get

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
out of the line of fire and at the same

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.580 
out of the line of fire and at the same
time<00:02:45.000> do<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.450> really<00:02:45.720> cool-looking<00:02:46.020> way

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
time do it in a really cool-looking way

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.250 
time do it in a really cool-looking way
we've<00:02:47.310> added<00:02:47.490> fluid<00:02:47.970> dynamics<00:02:48.480> interactive

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.190 
we've added fluid dynamics interactive
smoke<00:02:49.590> and<00:02:49.890> also<00:02:50.160> added<00:02:50.700> an<00:02:50.850> AI<00:02:51.090> system<00:02:51.330> to<00:02:52.050> it

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
smoke and also added an AI system to it

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:55.040 
smoke and also added an AI system to it
so<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.709> have<00:02:52.920> fish<00:02:53.580> move<00:02:54.270> out<00:02:54.450> of<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.630> way<00:02:54.750> when

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
so we have fish move out of the way when

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.080 
so we have fish move out of the way when
you<00:02:55.140> get<00:02:55.290> close<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.709> them<00:02:55.860> their<00:02:56.370> poly<00:02:56.580> counts

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
you get close to them their poly counts

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.210 
you get close to them their poly counts
