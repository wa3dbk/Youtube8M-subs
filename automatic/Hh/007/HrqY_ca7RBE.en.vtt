 for energy and now 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.500
 if the fifa has not pressed to be able 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.940

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.750
 let's see they do not want 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.340
 companies that emit the three girls in alicante besides that it is a little 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.300
 how was your flamenco sale card 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.189

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:15.360
 it was the truth that I do not know it will be because from chiquilla 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.330
 yes yes the candidacy although they recognize that once for life explains 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.440

 then he has a recording and patrick devedjian and resists him 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.480
 I think the way to go to take care of the street 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.050
 but do not go back to flamenco class also, that the Kirchnerism wants 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.310
 simply persie is possible 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.310

 It was the same one that always hits a lot like a warehouse 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:04.759
 but later 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.679
 covite marginal mixed possible past accompanied james blake that jorge 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:10.369
 Alvarez 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.549
 in a different way something like singer 

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:16.289
 flamenco singing 

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:20.119
 and how there would be a culture and lichen way to detect that base and language 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:22.519
 if he sings he does as I speak 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.319
 madrid may the midfielder 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.279
 and it is clear that flamenco touches 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:32.119
 some lucky and suddenly and he touches a cloth and and looks miracles occur 

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:34.059

 the sector more artists finish the main flamenco estibalis 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:54.359

 as I do 

00:03:38.999 --> 00:03:41.289
 to be able to get into this then 

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:43.809
 I decided to apply for the contest 

00:03:43.809 --> 00:03:45.259
