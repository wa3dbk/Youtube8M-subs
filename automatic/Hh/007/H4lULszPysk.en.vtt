00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.190

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.600
 new anime will be a sequel to dragon 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.699

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.070
 that there was toriyama the author of the most 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.930
 big of all the fucking life is going to be 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.469
 directly involved in the new 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.000
 anime 

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.940
 this new anime will air on Sundays 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.160
 on fuji tv and it is expected that the day 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:53.960
 next or as much after two days what 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.989
 we can get to see dubbed in Spanish 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.120
 or to English or wherever you are 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.680
 watching but probably as I am 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.530
 speaking spanish they are watching me in 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.440
 some country in the Spanish would be weird 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.490
 looking if you're English it would be weird 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.560
 that you were looking at me talking 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.530
 Spanish because probably not 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.330
 I would defend his peak maybe yes but I 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:16.250
 it does not matter we are talking about the great goal 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.570
 they go up 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.360
 sunrise time 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.700
 the story unfolds after the 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.920
 defeat of magic where land has been 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.710
 become a quiet place 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.229
 gentle and focus not to say boring 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.700
 According to the producer of Fuji TV Akira 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.700
 Toriyama has got a worked 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:40.140
 of lifelong fans like me 

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:42.210
 wet panties and also attract the 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.180
 new generation is also expected to 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:47.490
 the anime has a long duration and that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.040
 have the same global impact as 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.990

 huge I want to see it 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.650

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.460
 painted also that as if he had 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:09.020

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:12.200
 although you live in Argentina that strong 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.209

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:19.280
 visually or how will you paint the new 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:21.680
