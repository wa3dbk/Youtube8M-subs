00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.779
 review asus zenfone five and 502 CJ 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.940
 smartphone and zenfone 5 deservedly 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.950
 is in high demand among 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.530
 advanced smartphone users 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.670
 great price thoughtful stuffing and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.369
 sonorous name 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.560
 but there is one nuance sale you can 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.289
 meet zenfone 5 in 3 different 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.000
 modifications but most laudatory 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.840
 reviews does not apply to all 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.760
 versions 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.820
 for this reason we decided 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:33.170
 prepare a review of the most accessible asus 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.120
 zenfone 5 under the index and 520 CJ 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:38.579
 to evaluate the design and appearance and 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.280
 zenfone five necessary to throw out 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.399
 heads are all craving for beauty 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.280
 neat 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:46.410
 and elegant for beautiful shiny 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.600
 accessories should not be addressed to 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.320
 jesus and brutal massive appearance 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:55.610
 zenfone 5 clearly confirms this 145 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.930
 millimeters height 74 wide and almost 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.840
 11 millimeters in thickness 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.180
 add to this the weight of 160 grams and get 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.460
 one of the most brutal smartphones in 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.229
 its category is issued apparatus in 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.220
 red white and black 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.900
 but we recommend taking exactly black 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.670
 pictures assembly workmanship 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.220
 difficult to carp all collected for five with 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:19.439
 plus nothing backlash and execute 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.229
 Smartphone from the soft-touch matte 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.240
 plastic with small patches of sequins 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.520
 the entire front surface is divided into

 durable touch glass gorilla glass 3 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.079
 oleophobic coated and bottom 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.790
 metal insert with 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.340
 machine trimming effect 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.140
 three touch buttons are located below 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.000
 control and the top is visible grid

 cameras and lighting sensor unit screen 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.950
 the smartphone takes only a little more 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.689
 half of the face area that 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340
 may disappoint thin lovers 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.990
 framework 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.020
 the diagonal of the plays the matrix is 5 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.689
 inches but her resolution is only 960 on 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.670
 540 points so make out individual 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.530
 pixels is no problem 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.960
 color quality is good 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.970
 but the maximum brightness is twice as low 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.950
 many competitors on the sides of the hull 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.739
 You can observe the standard location 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.260
 elements and connectors bottom and top 

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:15.819
 spaced a couple of microphones on the right 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.790

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.440
 protruding camera unit with LED 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.690
 flash 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.970
 as well as a fine mesh core hole 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.940
 the speaker is not from the loudest 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.920
 but with a clear rich sound already 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.470
 under the lid we see the sail tray under 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.569
 practical sim cards as well 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.190
 Mike memory card tray 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:40.840
 everywhere 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.180
 smartphone battery is deep inside and 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:45.239
 change it only with a screwdriver 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.239
 with desirable service 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.890
 Ace Zenfone 5 modifications and 520 CJ 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.590
 built based on mobile 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:57.819
 dual core processor intel atom z 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.860
 2520 with a clock frequency of 1.3 gigahertz 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.190
 one gigabyte of ram and 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.040
 powervr sgx544 graphics 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.160
 the filling is not the most powerful that 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.980
 confirm the results of the benchmark antutu 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.049
 which showed a little more than 18 thousand points in 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:15.880
 games and applications results are also 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.519
 very average especially in part 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:20.380
 graphics performance is weak 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:23.019
 place for intel mobile chipsets 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:26.079
 devices on android in terms of memory 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:28.420
 and the smartphone has 8 gigabytes installed 

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:30.840
 although only half is available at startup 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.160
 in this scenario, the memory card 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.560
 sure to come in handy as 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.049
 bonus have usb lg g support for 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.880
 Connect the mouse keyboard or yusb 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:42.280
 flash drives through a special adapter 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:45.269
 but a set of communications looks 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:46.920
 pretty standard if harnesses and vayfay 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:50.049
 gps receiver 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.329
 smartphone asus zenfone 5 works under

 operating system management zenory 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.590
 version 2 2 combines 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:59.560
 minimalistic air design and 

00:03:56.590 --> 00:04:01.540
 deep customization level 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.519
 you can literally just about anything 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:05.930
 despite the deceptive similarities with 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:08.359
 standard android 4 4 2 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.510
 in fact, the shell is from c closer to yo 

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:13.609
 10 standard applications neatly 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.890
 redrawn under the general concept for 

00:04:13.609 --> 00:04:18.320
 her that provides comfort and ease 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.989
 perform most standard tasks 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.850
 support of two sim cards is implemented here 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.039
 the classic way for android 

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.680
 you are a preset set of sentences and 

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:30.139
 2 needs a detailed description of 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.940
 interesting things worth mentioning are gorgeous 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.020
 short application 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:35.000
 handwritten notes 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:36.740
 which allows you to really enter 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.830
 handwriting any suitable 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.900
 stylus but the most pleasant bonus 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.360
 is a pre-installed license not 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.190
 will come allowing you to enjoy one of 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:48.320
 best navigation apps for 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.960
 Russia is really significant 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.970
 Argument in favor of buying Ace zenfone 5 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:54.979
 out of the box smartphone supports 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.470
 many different formats and codecs 

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:59.630
 for a video that allows you to watch any 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.380
 movies and TV shows via standard 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:03.020
 turntable 

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:04.849
 photo galleries and also any claims 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.030
 here's the music player clearly 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:10.580
 copied from a simple play music 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:12.139
 equalizers at all sample of 2012 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.270
 although the sound quality in general 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.430
 good enough quality 

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.810
 headphones smartphone great work out 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:19.669
 complex many instrumental 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:21.560
 compositions and quite capable 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.199
 compete with samsung flagships 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.300
 as for the camera here installed 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:26.750
 interesting 8 megapixel module from 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.300
 sony 

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:31.699
 soft focus optics and LED 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:34.039
 flash manufacturer stresses 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:36.080
 an abundance of different shooting modes and 

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:38.930
 unique pixel bridge technology 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.699
 creating something amazing on our 

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:42.949
 view the result of camera creativity 

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:45.650
 It turns out very good with accurate 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:48.770
 white balance and high hit 

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:51.440
 detail of all elements of the frame but here 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:53.240
 Selfie camera here is just no though for 

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:55.490
 emergency video call on skype and 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.710
 quite enough before you let 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.110
 the results of our video review left for us 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:02.300
 just tell you about the battery here 

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:04.849
 2500 built-in capacity 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.009
 milliampere hours and grabs it almost on 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.830
 two days of operation at an average 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:12.169
 the load is exactly at this time 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.849
 count when buying a smartphone but in 

00:06:12.169 --> 00:06:16.370
 maximum load smartphone 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:19.970
 last about 5 hours something 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.669
 laudable verdict summing up 

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:25.780
 testing asus zenfone 5 modification 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:28.460
 and the 527 jeep did not leave us feeling 

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.530
 duplicity of the model on the one hand here 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:32.150
 well balanced filling and 

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.449
 rich set of possibilities 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:38.900
 but from another country a lot of every kind 

00:06:35.449 --> 00:06:40.190
 dim screen bulky case and weak 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.220
 gaming performance 

00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.080
 but it perfectly keeps the battery practical and 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:47.180
 Comes with Navitel cards in 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.810
 are you interested in the complex ? 

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:49.810
 such benefits
