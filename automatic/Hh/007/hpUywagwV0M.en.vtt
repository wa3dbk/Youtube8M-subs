those<00:02:00.360> on<00:02:00.600> would<00:02:00.990> do<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.619> our<00:02:01.710> channel<00:02:02.100> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
think in order for YouTube ads to be

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.200 
think in order for YouTube ads to be
really<00:02:04.350> meaningful<00:02:04.799> you<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
really meaningful you have to have a

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.630 
really meaningful you have to have a
much<00:02:07.110> larger<00:02:07.560> channel<00:02:07.950> before<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.429> start

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
much larger channel before you start

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:10.820 
much larger channel before you start
making<00:02:08.819> any<00:02:09.060> real<00:02:09.330> serious<00:02:09.840> revenue<00:02:10.440> from<00:02:10.619> it

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
making any real serious revenue from it

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.210 
making any real serious revenue from it
but<00:02:11.459> I<00:02:11.520> have<00:02:11.700> no<00:02:11.819> idea<00:02:12.379> so<00:02:13.379> at<00:02:13.590> 55

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
but I have no idea so at 55

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.120 
but I have no idea so at 55
k<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.630> idea<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.020> we<00:02:16.380> continue<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.830> leave<00:02:17.010> the

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:17.130 
k the idea is we continue to leave the

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:20.000 
k the idea is we continue to leave the
YouTube<00:02:17.490> ads<00:02:17.790> off<00:02:18.300> if<00:02:19.260> we<00:02:19.380> raise<00:02:19.560> less<00:02:19.830> than

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
YouTube ads off if we raise less than

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.470 
YouTube ads off if we raise less than
that<00:02:20.130> I<00:02:20.310> may<00:02:20.490> consider<00:02:20.820> turning<00:02:21.030> them<00:02:21.210> on<00:02:21.270> I

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:21.480 
that I may consider turning them on I

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.720 
that I may consider turning them on I
still<00:02:21.690> haven't<00:02:21.870> decided<00:02:22.050> yet<00:02:22.590> myself<00:02:22.890> I've

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
still haven't decided yet myself I've

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.910 
still haven't decided yet myself I've
heard<00:02:23.940> from<00:02:24.060> many<00:02:24.150> people<00:02:24.660> hey<00:02:25.080> rod<00:02:25.320> turn<00:02:25.830> the

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
our fundraiser if they don't at least

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.449 
our fundraiser if they don't at least
five<00:04:01.140> dollars<00:04:01.500> well<00:04:01.709> it's<00:04:01.890> a<00:04:01.950> lot<00:04:02.100> of<00:04:02.130> names

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
five dollars well it's a lot of names

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.400 
five dollars well it's a lot of names
and<00:04:02.640> that<00:04:02.760> would<00:04:02.850> mean<00:04:03.000> printing<00:04:03.299> out<00:04:03.390> lots<00:04:04.200> of

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
and that would mean printing out lots of

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.440 
and that would mean printing out lots of
pages<00:04:04.860> of<00:04:05.070> paper<00:04:05.340> and<00:04:05.640> that's<00:04:05.820> just<00:04:05.910> wasted

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
pages of paper and that's just wasted

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:08.180 
pages of paper and that's just wasted
full<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:06.870> there's<00:04:07.140> no<00:04:07.230> need<00:04:07.260> for<00:04:07.500> that<00:04:07.620> instead

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
full so there's no need for that instead

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.100 
full so there's no need for that instead
I<00:04:08.220> have<00:04:08.370> this<00:04:08.489> spreadsheet<00:04:08.790> and<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:09.600> you<00:04:09.959> are

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
I have this spreadsheet and if you are

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.600 
I have this spreadsheet and if you are
in<00:04:10.230> the<00:04:10.320> contest<00:04:10.739> but<00:04:10.830> you<00:04:10.920> didn't<00:04:11.130> donate<00:04:11.340> I

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:11.610 
in the contest but you didn't donate I

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:13.400 
in the contest but you didn't donate I
have<00:04:11.910> those<00:04:12.120> sort<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.510> spillover<00:04:12.780> names<00:04:13.230> here

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
have those sort of spillover names here

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.140 
have those sort of spillover names here
on<00:04:13.500> this<00:04:13.620> sheet<00:04:13.830> of<00:04:13.920> paper<00:04:14.100> so<00:04:14.700> once<00:04:14.910> we<00:04:15.030> go

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
on this sheet of paper so once we go

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.940 
on this sheet of paper so once we go
beyond<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> spreadsheet<00:04:16.169> then<00:04:16.590> we<00:04:16.680> go<00:04:16.769> to<00:04:16.799> the

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
beyond the spreadsheet then we go to the

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.890 
beyond the spreadsheet then we go to the
sheet<00:04:17.160> it's<00:04:17.669> very<00:04:17.760> convoluted<00:04:18.150> I<00:04:18.419> know<00:04:18.479> but

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
sheet it's very convoluted I know but

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.659 
sheet it's very convoluted I know but
but<00:04:19.350> it<00:04:19.470> does<00:04:19.590> make<00:04:19.739> it<00:04:19.890> a<00:04:19.950> little<00:04:19.979> easier<00:04:20.250> for

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
but it does make it a little easier for

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.089 
but it does make it a little easier for
me<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.030> hopefully<00:04:21.740> better<00:04:22.740> for<00:04:23.010> the

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
me and hopefully better for the

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.409 
me and hopefully better for the
environment<00:04:23.190> all<00:04:23.760> right<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.150> I'm<00:04:24.240> going<00:04:24.360> to

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
environment all right so I'm going to

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.080 
environment all right so I'm going to
touch<00:04:24.599> the<00:04:25.140> screen<00:04:25.349> here<00:04:25.820> the<00:04:26.820> winner<00:04:27.000> is

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
touch the screen here the winner is

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.010
