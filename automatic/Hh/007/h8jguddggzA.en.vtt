because this one is very sheer coverage

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:41.980 
because this one is very sheer coverage
like<00:05:38.020> it<00:05:39.020> really<00:05:39.440> doesn't<00:05:39.889> come<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:41.120> me<00:05:41.270> I<00:05:41.539> mean

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
like it really doesn't come to me I mean

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.370 
like it really doesn't come to me I mean
like<00:05:42.680> I<00:05:42.800> said<00:05:43.300> I'm<00:05:44.300> a<00:05:44.360> full<00:05:44.659> coverage<00:05:44.990> kind<00:05:45.260> of

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:45.380 
like I said I'm a full coverage kind of

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:47.560 
like I said I'm a full coverage kind of
girl<00:05:45.590> so<00:05:46.070> some<00:05:46.550> of<00:05:46.580> you<00:05:46.760> might<00:05:46.940> disagree<00:05:47.270> with

girl so some of you might disagree with

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.050 
girl so some of you might disagree with
me<00:05:47.750> I<00:05:47.960> mean<00:05:48.560> it<00:05:48.680> covers<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.010> little<00:05:49.669> bit<00:05:49.820> I<00:05:50.030> think

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
me I mean it covers a little bit I think

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.240 
me I mean it covers a little bit I think
this<00:05:50.419> is<00:05:50.630> more<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:51.080> just<00:05:51.289> even<00:05:51.710> out<00:05:52.010> your<00:05:52.190> skin

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.250 
this is more to just even out your skin

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:55.629 
this is more to just even out your skin
tone<00:05:53.080> yeah<00:05:54.080> it's<00:05:54.560> actually<00:05:54.919> more<00:05:55.039> to<00:05:55.190> us<00:05:55.340> but

00:05:55.629 --> 00:05:55.639 
tone yeah it's actually more to us but

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.089 
tone yeah it's actually more to us but
this<00:05:55.820> like<00:05:55.970> really<00:05:56.150> sheer<00:05:56.510> and<00:05:56.780> it<00:05:57.530> has<00:05:57.830> like<00:05:58.070> a

00:05:58.089 --> 00:05:58.099 
this like really sheer and it has like a

00:05:58.099 --> 00:06:01.870 
this like really sheer and it has like a
glow<00:05:58.639> finish<00:05:59.270> to<00:05:59.479> it<00:05:59.510> a<00:05:59.870> dewy<00:06:00.530> finish<00:06:00.770> which<00:06:01.610> is

glow finish to it a dewy finish which is

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.170 
glow finish to it a dewy finish which is
good<00:06:02.449> for<00:06:02.479> dry<00:06:02.930> skin<00:06:03.050> I<00:06:03.650> think<00:06:04.010> but<00:06:04.760> definitely

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.180 
good for dry skin I think but definitely

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.300 
good for dry skin I think but definitely
not<00:06:05.270> good<00:06:05.510> for<00:06:05.690> oily<00:06:05.840> skin<00:06:06.050> cuz<00:06:06.650> in<00:06:07.010> an<00:06:07.159> hour

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
not good for oily skin cuz in an hour
