let's<00:00:39.540> see<00:00:39.809> what<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.110> quick<00:00:40.350> kid<00:00:40.590> has<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.980> say

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.540 

so<00:00:45.870> we've<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:46.170> been<00:00:46.649> out<00:00:46.950> at<00:00:47.129> Manly<00:00:47.309> damn

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
so we've just been out at Manly damn

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.330 
so we've just been out at Manly damn
riding<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:47.969> supply<00:00:48.390> 100<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> it's<00:00:49.920> essentially

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
riding a supply 100 and it's essentially

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.590 
riding a supply 100 and it's essentially
from<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.550> Gary<00:00:50.789> Fisher<00:00:51.000> collection<00:00:51.449> which

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
from the Gary Fisher collection which

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
from the Gary Fisher collection which
means<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.050> it's<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.260> 29er<00:00:52.820> 29er<00:00:53.820> bike<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.300> in

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
means that it's a 29er 29er bike now in

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.900 
means that it's a 29er 29er bike now in
this<00:00:54.539> case<00:00:54.750> in<00:00:54.989> particular<00:00:55.079> it's<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:55.920> 110<00:00:56.670> milt

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
this case in particular it's a 110 milt

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.119 
this case in particular it's a 110 milt
Ravel<00:00:57.300> cross<00:00:58.079> country<00:00:58.289> race<00:00:58.859> bike

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
Ravel cross country race bike

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.279 
Ravel cross country race bike
essentially<00:00:59.730> and<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.510> just<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.809> great<00:01:01.050> bike

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
essentially and it's just a great bike

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.320 
essentially and it's just a great bike
ride<00:01:03.799> so<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> think<00:01:05.159> that<00:01:05.610> for<00:01:05.790> climbing<00:01:06.210> this

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
ride so I think that for climbing this

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.880 
ride so I think that for climbing this
bikes<00:01:06.570> really<00:01:06.930> good<00:01:07.080> because<00:01:07.350> not<00:01:07.470> only<00:01:07.530> is<00:01:07.860> a

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bikes really good because not only is a

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.310 
bikes really good because not only is a
super<00:01:08.310> lightweight<00:01:08.520> but<00:01:09.270> also<00:01:09.299> 29<00:01:10.110> inch

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
super lightweight but also 29 inch

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.630 
super lightweight but also 29 inch
wheels<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.710> mean<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> whole<00:01:11.340> lot<00:01:11.520> more

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
wheels I mean you get a whole lot more

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:12.800 
wheels I mean you get a whole lot more
traction<00:01:11.970> up<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.330> you<00:01:12.390> can<00:01:12.510> just<00:01:12.659> get<00:01:12.750> up

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
traction up so you can just get up

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.560 
traction up so you can just get up
everything<00:01:13.350> it<00:01:13.470> just<00:01:13.500> essentially<00:01:14.280> rides

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 
everything it just essentially rides

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.300 
everything it just essentially rides
like<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.630> truck<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> certain<00:01:16.680> extent<00:01:17.070> but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
like a truck to a certain extent but

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:18.590 
like a truck to a certain extent but
when<00:01:17.520> you're<00:01:17.670> climbing<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.150> feels<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.570> a

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
when you're climbing it feels like a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.230 
when you're climbing it feels like a
mountain<00:01:18.960> go<00:01:19.340> all<00:01:20.340> around<00:01:20.460> trail<00:01:20.820> riding<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
mountain go all around trail riding this

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.670 
mountain go all around trail riding this
bike<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.600> great<00:01:21.780> because<00:01:21.990> the<00:01:22.110> 29-inch<00:01:22.650> wheels

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
bike is great because the 29-inch wheels

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.550 
bike is great because the 29-inch wheels
effectively<00:01:23.610> add<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.720> 20<00:01:24.900> mils<00:01:25.140> of<00:01:25.290> travel

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
effectively add really 20 mils of travel

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.230 
effectively add really 20 mils of travel
to<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> bike<00:01:25.979> which<00:01:26.280> means<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.759> for<00:01:27.000> all<00:01:27.030> our

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
to the bike which means that for all our

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.330 
to the bike which means that for all our
trail<00:01:27.509> riding<00:01:27.780> is<00:01:28.350> just<00:01:28.560> absolutely<00:01:29.009> great

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
trail riding is just absolutely great

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.950 
trail riding is just absolutely great
you<00:01:29.369> feel<00:01:29.670> like<00:01:29.909> you're<00:01:30.060> by<00:01:30.180> riding<00:01:30.570> a<00:01:30.750> bike

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
you feel like you're by riding a bike

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.990 
you feel like you're by riding a bike
that<00:01:31.259> really<00:01:32.040> should<00:01:32.280> be<00:01:32.310> comparable

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
that really should be comparable

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.010 
that really should be comparable
downhill<00:01:33.600> to<00:01:33.810> something<00:01:34.110> like<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.259> fuel<00:01:34.619> the<00:01:34.740> X

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
downhill to something like a fuel the X

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.840 
downhill to something like a fuel the X
detect<00:01:37.020> behind<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.500> GT<00:01:37.920> geometry<00:01:38.490> offset

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
detect behind the GT geometry offset

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.429 
detect behind the GT geometry offset
fork<00:01:39.119> sounds<00:01:39.450> cool<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:39.930> how<00:01:40.170> does<00:01:40.320> it

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
fork sounds cool but how does it

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.560 
fork sounds cool but how does it
translate<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.310> trail<00:01:41.570> saying

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
translate on the trail saying

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
translate on the trail saying
essentially<00:01:43.229> what<00:01:43.350> we're<00:01:43.530> getting<00:01:43.649> is<00:01:43.950> you're

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
essentially what we're getting is you're

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.679 
essentially what we're getting is you're
getting<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.729> bike<00:01:44.939> that's<00:01:45.210> really<00:01:45.509> really

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
getting a bike that's really really

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.480 
getting a bike that's really really
comfortable<00:01:45.990> at<00:01:46.380> low<00:01:46.530> speed<00:01:46.829> but<00:01:47.310> also

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
comfortable at low speed but also

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.120 
comfortable at low speed but also
handles<00:01:48.270> high<00:01:48.479> speed<00:01:48.840> situations<00:01:49.560> with

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
handles high speed situations with

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.310 
handles high speed situations with
confidence<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:51.270> this<00:01:51.420> bike<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.899> not<00:01:52.049> let<00:01:52.200> you

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
confidence so this bike will not let you

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.990 
confidence so this bike will not let you
