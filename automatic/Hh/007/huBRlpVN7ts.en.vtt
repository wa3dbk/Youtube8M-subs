move<00:02:21.410> like<00:02:21.800> maybe<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.610> don't<00:02:23.120> know<00:02:23.270> you<00:02:24.140> try<00:02:24.440> to

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
move like maybe I don't know you try to

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.340 
move like maybe I don't know you try to
run<00:02:25.850> away<00:02:25.910> from<00:02:26.150> them<00:02:26.420> but<00:02:26.690> then<00:02:27.020> you<00:02:27.170> hide

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
run away from them but then you hide

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.290 
run away from them but then you hide
around<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.680> corner<00:02:27.740> time<00:02:28.700> they<00:02:28.910> may<00:02:29.060> come

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
around the corner time they may come

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.730 
around the corner time they may come
after<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.690> and<00:02:29.750> then<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.170> just<00:02:30.350> shoot<00:02:30.560> them

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
after you and then you just shoot them

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.280 
after you and then you just shoot them
and<00:02:31.490> when<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.760> was<00:02:31.880> a<00:02:31.940> normal<00:02:32.090> player<00:02:32.420> human

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
and when I was a normal player human

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.680 
and when I was a normal player human
player<00:02:33.470> they<00:02:33.710> would<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.330> probably<00:02:35.330> know<00:02:35.570> that

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
player they would I probably know that

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.210 
player they would I probably know that
you're<00:02:35.870> behind<00:02:36.050> the<00:02:36.290> corner<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:36.860> they<00:02:36.980> were

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
you're behind the corner so they were

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.700 
you're behind the corner so they were
probably<00:02:37.580> like<00:02:37.850> Logan<00:02:38.300> aid<00:02:38.420> over<00:02:39.350> there<00:02:39.500> or

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
probably like Logan aid over there or

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.680 
probably like Logan aid over there or
something<00:02:39.770> like<00:02:40.070> that<00:02:40.130> but<00:02:40.580> the<00:02:41.090> bots<00:02:41.330> are

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
something like that but the bots are

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.500 
something like that but the bots are
good<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:42.400> and<00:02:43.400> they're<00:02:43.790> good<00:02:44.090> for<00:02:44.360> people

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
good and and they're good for people

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.230 
good and and they're good for people
that<00:02:44.780> either<00:02:45.230> good<00:02:45.560> at<00:02:45.730> special<00:02:46.730> judo's<00:02:47.030> or

kill zone games in general and you can

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:53.650 
kill zone games in general and you can

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:53.660 
just train against them if you can't go

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.120 
just train against them if you can't go
online<00:02:53.810> or<00:02:54.080> something<00:02:54.200> like<00:02:54.380> that<00:02:54.470> or<00:02:54.770> can<00:02:55.010> you

barton not that that easy but they're

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.250 
barton not that that easy but they're
not<00:03:04.850> back<00:03:05.090> tough<00:03:05.390> they're<00:03:05.780> kind<00:03:06.050> of<00:03:06.080> in

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
not back tough they're kind of in

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:08.980 
not back tough they're kind of in
between<00:03:06.350> I<00:03:07.120> actually<00:03:08.120> have<00:03:08.390> some<00:03:08.600> gameplay

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:08.990 
between I actually have some gameplay

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:10.450 
between I actually have some gameplay
for<00:03:09.170> the<00:03:09.230> barts<00:03:09.560> I<00:03:09.710> wasn't<00:03:10.070> playing<00:03:10.220> on<00:03:10.430> a

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:10.460 
for the barts I wasn't playing on a

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.840 
for the barts I wasn't playing on a
really<00:03:10.550> hard<00:03:11.030> difficulty<00:03:11.660> but<00:03:11.840> because<00:03:12.850> the

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 
really hard difficulty but because the

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:15.850 
really hard difficulty but because the
very<00:03:14.030> hard<00:03:14.450> difficulty<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.110> all<00:03:15.320> actually

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
very hard difficulty is all actually

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.040 
very hard difficulty is all actually
quite<00:03:16.460> challenging<00:03:16.730> if<00:03:17.180> you're<00:03:17.450> not<00:03:17.690> used<00:03:17.960> to

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
quite challenging if you're not used to

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:20.290 
quite challenging if you're not used to
the<00:03:18.200> game<00:03:18.410> and<00:03:18.910> when<00:03:19.910> you're<00:03:20.000> trying<00:03:20.210> to

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
the game and when you're trying to

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.200 
the game and when you're trying to
record<00:03:20.630> something<00:03:21.340> it<00:03:22.340> can<00:03:22.550> be<00:03:22.640> annoying<00:03:22.880> if

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:23.210 
record something it can be annoying if

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:25.990 
record something it can be annoying if
you're<00:03:23.360> gonna<00:03:23.480> die<00:03:23.750> every<00:03:24.160> couple<00:03:25.160> seconds<00:03:25.640> so

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
you're gonna die every couple seconds so

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.090 
you're gonna die every couple seconds so
and<00:03:26.420> if<00:03:26.810> you<00:03:26.900> want<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.170> get<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.470> decent<00:03:27.740> game

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
and if you want to get a decent game

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.970 
and if you want to get a decent game
play<00:03:28.370> you<00:03:28.820> need<00:03:29.030> to<00:03:29.210> have<00:03:29.450> a<00:03:30.410> little

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
play you need to have a little

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.010 
play you need to have a little
difficulty<00:03:31.460> for<00:03:31.910> the<00:03:31.970> box<00:03:32.150> because<00:03:32.660> if<00:03:32.900> we

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:33.020 
difficulty for the box because if we

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.020 
difficulty for the box because if we
don't<00:03:33.170> then<00:03:33.350> the<00:03:33.530> boxer<00:03:34.220> just<00:03:34.400> pretty<00:03:34.880> much

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:35.030 
don't then the boxer just pretty much

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.590 
don't then the boxer just pretty much
church<00:03:35.060> who<00:03:35.720> right<00:03:35.930> away<00:03:36.200> and<00:03:37.240> kill<00:03:38.240> you<00:03:38.420> off

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
church who right away and kill you off

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.950 
church who right away and kill you off
in<00:03:39.020> the<00:03:39.170> matter<00:03:39.350> of<00:03:39.470> seconds<00:03:40.160> so<00:03:40.580> it<00:03:40.910> is<00:03:41.180> he's

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:41.960 
in the matter of seconds so it is he's

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.220 
in the matter of seconds so it is he's
really<00:03:42.350> annoying<00:03:43.070> it<00:03:43.940> really<00:03:44.120> is<00:03:44.480> give<00:03:45.080> me<00:03:45.200> a

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
really annoying it really is give me a

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.050 
really annoying it really is give me a
little<00:03:45.350> bit<00:03:45.500> hard<00:03:45.710> with<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.890> bot<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.490> I<00:03:46.700> do

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
little bit hard with the bot so I do

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.600 
little bit hard with the bot so I do
have<00:03:47.180> gameplay<00:03:47.660> after<00:03:47.960> this<00:03:48.080> that<00:03:48.410> is<00:03:48.920> using

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:49.610 
have gameplay after this that is using

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:53.380 
have gameplay after this that is using
the<00:03:49.670> f1<00:03:50.030> the<00:03:50.180> LMGs<00:03:50.720> in<00:03:50.960> the<00:03:51.020> game<00:03:51.200> and<00:03:51.760> I<00:03:52.760> use

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
the f1 the LMGs in the game and I use

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.630 
the f1 the LMGs in the game and I use
the<00:03:53.540> lmg<00:03:53.900> I<00:03:54.110> think<00:03:54.500> I<00:03:54.590> use<00:03:54.740> it<00:03:54.860> pretty<00:03:55.040> well<00:03:55.340> I

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
the lmg I think I use it pretty well I

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:57.490 
the lmg I think I use it pretty well I
probably<00:03:56.270> probably<00:03:56.660> could<00:03:57.080> have<00:03:57.110> used<00:03:57.200> it

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
probably probably could have used it

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.450 
probably probably could have used it
better<00:03:57.650> but<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:57.980> was<00:03:58.070> when<00:03:58.190> the<00:03:58.280> first

00:03:58.450 --> 00:03:58.460 
better but it was when the first

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.120 
better but it was when the first
gameplay<00:03:59.080> videos<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.230> I<00:04:00.320> did<00:04:00.500> record<00:04:00.830> for

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:01.130 
gameplay videos that I did record for

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.280 
gameplay videos that I did record for
killzone<00:04:01.460> 3<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.270> one<00:04:02.510> of<00:04:02.570> the<00:04:02.660> first<00:04:02.810> games<00:04:03.020> I

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:03.290

killzone 3 and one of the first games I
record<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:04.040> I<00:04:04.280> played<00:04:04.850> for<00:04:05.090> killzone<00:04:05.420> 3<00:04:05.720> soil<00:04:05.990> I

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:06.260 
record it I played for killzone 3 soil I

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:08.890 
record it I played for killzone 3 soil I
wasn't<00:04:06.920> exactly<00:04:07.220> into<00:04:07.940> the<00:04:08.030> game<00:04:08.210> at<00:04:08.720> that

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
wasn't exactly into the game at that

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.320 
wasn't exactly into the game at that
