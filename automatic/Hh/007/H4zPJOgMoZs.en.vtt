00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.030
 with you fire Ukraine my name is you 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.139
 Catherine and today I want to tell 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:17.310
 show you how to open the hood very 

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:20.770
 just it turns out you need to 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:25.860
 you press preferably with a thin end 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:28.020
 you already hammer you the same dishonest coconut 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:32.460
 prepare a cup for 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.809
 rummage before buying a coconut 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.480
 make sure it is fresh ie shake 

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.909
 its if you check the water strain of the rivers 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.670
 almost half 

00:00:38.909 --> 00:00:45.999
 can give birth further look in what yourself 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:49.960
 there are such eyes here one of 

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:54.420
 cook them it will be soft therefore with a knife 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.420
 we find which one is soft and 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:06.089
 start to turn this thing to do 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:06.089
 a little hole is enough for that 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.509
 could go out 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:29.979
 contractual 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.110
 This way very many ways 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:42.490
 idea and you are hot and doctors lego lego 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.490
 everything seems so much easier 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.380
 It turns out she is so with a hole 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:54.670
 plump we need to extract it. 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.739
 also make sure that the water is not 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:30.890
 sour 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:42.170
 slightly praying mantis fine 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:45.260
 next we need and fleece we are looking for the most 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:03:03.760
 weak spot at coconut and in the place itself 

00:02:45.260 --> 00:03:12.320
 she's 3 pounding literally turned out 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:17.030
 open around and we get 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.160
 such a thing look to him 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.620
 it was easier to open even more 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:27.550
 extract 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:30.530
 can take a towel turn 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.890
 close behind so the pieces don't 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.390
 scatter throughout the kitchen you can 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:39.970
 knock on it again and again 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.500
 oh its fine parts but i advise 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.930
 why not do this because when 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.600
 you can turn such equal parts 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.230
 here are the candlesticks for 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.280
