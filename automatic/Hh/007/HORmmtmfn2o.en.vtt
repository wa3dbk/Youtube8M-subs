them cut a and cut B here we will make
cut<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.580> on<00:00:20.910> both<00:00:21.300> pieces<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.990> stock<00:00:22.290> that<00:00:22.500> will

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
cut a on both pieces of stock that will

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:25.339 
cut a on both pieces of stock that will
make<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.009> long<00:00:23.279> side<00:00:23.700> of<00:00:23.730> our<00:00:24.029> box<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.599> we

make the long side of our box and we

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:27.620 
make the long side of our box and we
will<00:00:25.470> make<00:00:25.650> cut<00:00:25.980> B<00:00:26.250> on<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.849> stock<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> makes

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
will make cut B on the stock that makes

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.950

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.080 
up the short size of our box as you can
see<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.560> only<00:00:31.710> difference<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.580> two<00:00:32.790> cuts

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
see the only difference in the two cuts

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.810 
see the only difference in the two cuts
is<00:00:33.390> a<00:00:33.650> 5/32<00:00:34.650> height<00:00:34.830> adjustment<00:00:35.460> with<00:00:35.610> your

you didn't cut B once cuts a and B are

00:01:45.989 --> 00:01:48.109 
you didn't cut B once cuts a and B are
both<00:01:46.020> complete<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:47.009> can<00:01:47.039> now<00:01:47.369> test<00:01:47.789> for<00:01:48.090> a

leaving<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.700> fingers<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> little<00:01:51.390> long<00:01:51.750> will

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
leaving the fingers a little long will

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.540 
leaving the fingers a little long will
allow<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:52.319> to<00:01:52.440> sand<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:53.009> down<00:01:53.039> for<00:01:53.520> a

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:53.550 
allow you to sand it down for a

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.169 
allow you to sand it down for a
perfectly<00:01:54.149> flush<00:01:54.479> joint<00:01:54.899> later

00:01:56.169 --> 00:01:56.179 
perfectly flush joint later

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:58.999 
perfectly flush joint later
now<00:01:57.179> you<00:01:57.239> can<00:01:57.599> glue<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:58.050> up<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:58.440> sand<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.979> down

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
now you can glue it up and sand it down

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.190 
now you can glue it up and sand it down
and<00:01:59.580> look<00:02:00.090> at<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.330> beautiful<00:02:00.599> joint<00:02:01.050> you've
