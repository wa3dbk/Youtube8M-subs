00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.090 
stuff from this brand called xtm style
um<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:39.480> seems<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.320> be<00:00:40.410> only<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.590> more<00:00:40.770> popular

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
um it seems to be only the more popular

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.889 
um it seems to be only the more popular
brands<00:00:41.309> because<00:00:42.059> their<00:00:42.239> stuff<00:00:42.450> is<00:00:42.600> always

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
brands because their stuff is always

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.560 
brands because their stuff is always
sold<00:00:43.110> out<00:00:44.059> but<00:00:45.059> the<00:00:45.120> name<00:00:45.239> is<00:00:45.329> probably

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
sold out but the name is probably

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
sold out but the name is probably
because<00:00:45.870> these<00:00:46.860> men<00:00:47.190> don't<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.820> anything

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
because these men don't know anything

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
mean I feel like this is enough but if

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.650 
mean I feel like this is enough but if
you<00:03:20.190> find<00:03:20.459> that<00:03:20.550> your<00:03:20.760> skin<00:03:20.790> is<00:03:21.120> you<00:03:21.510> know<00:03:21.630> a

really<00:03:34.230> like<00:03:34.560> is<00:03:34.770> how<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:35.340> mean<00:03:36.030> it's<00:03:36.300> the<00:03:36.840> mist

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.050 
really like is how I mean it's the mist

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.740 
really like is how I mean it's the mist
is<00:03:37.230> fine<00:03:37.590> but<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.010> it's<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.310> arm's<00:03:39.120> length<00:03:39.239> I

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
is fine but if it's like arm's length I

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.750 
is fine but if it's like arm's length I
think<00:03:39.900> I'm<00:03:40.200> on<00:03:40.410> here<00:03:40.709> it<00:03:40.890> does<00:03:41.100> say<00:03:41.370> that<00:03:41.670> you

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:41.760 
think I'm on here it does say that you

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.229 
think I'm on here it does say that you
need<00:03:41.970> to<00:03:42.410> spray<00:03:43.410> arm's<00:03:43.860> length<00:03:43.950> away<00:03:44.370> arms

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
need to spray arm's length away arms

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:48.229 
need to spray arm's length away arms
think<00:03:45.450> that's<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.810> far<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:47.730> true<00:03:48.060> you're

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:48.239 
think that's so far it's true you're

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:52.460 
think that's so far it's true you're
gonna<00:03:48.360> go<00:03:48.570> like<00:03:48.720> here<00:03:49.080> cuz<00:03:51.110> if<00:03:52.110> it's<00:03:52.320> any

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
gonna go like here cuz if it's any

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.199 
gonna go like here cuz if it's any
closer<00:03:52.830> it<00:03:53.100> kind<00:03:53.489> of<00:03:53.519> constitutes

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:54.209 
closer it kind of constitutes

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:56.750 
closer it kind of constitutes
concentrate<00:03:54.750> on<00:03:54.810> like<00:03:54.930> a<00:03:54.959> small<00:03:55.590> area<00:03:55.800> so<00:03:56.160> if

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
concentrate on like a small area so if

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.910 
concentrate on like a small area so if
it's<00:03:57.030> arm's<00:03:57.600> length<00:03:57.690> away<00:03:57.959> then<00:03:58.290> it<00:03:58.440> should<00:03:58.739> be

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
it's arm's length away then it should be

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.259 
it's arm's length away then it should be
fine<00:03:59.280> enough<00:03:59.489> for<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.820> get<00:03:59.970> all<00:04:00.150> over

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
fine enough for you to get all over

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.020 
fine enough for you to get all over
without<00:04:00.690> using<00:04:01.530> too<00:04:01.680> much<00:04:01.830> the<00:04:02.489> third<00:04:02.700> thing<00:04:02.910> I

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
without using too much the third thing I

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:04.910 
without using too much the third thing I
thought<00:04:03.180> was<00:04:03.300> kind<00:04:03.540> of<00:04:03.600> interesting

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
thought was kind of interesting

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.170 
thought was kind of interesting
it's<00:04:05.460> the<00:04:05.819> no-sebum<00:04:06.780> son<00:04:07.230> stick<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.190> it<00:04:08.220> has

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
it's the no-sebum son stick and I it has

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.020 
it's the no-sebum son stick and I it has
SPF<00:04:09.569> 50<00:04:10.050> P<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> triple<00:04:10.920> plus<00:04:11.130> and<00:04:11.459> it's<00:04:11.819> supposed

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
SPF 50 P a triple plus and it's supposed

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.570 
SPF 50 P a triple plus and it's supposed
to<00:04:12.060> be<00:04:12.150> like<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.300> solid<00:04:12.900> a<00:04:13.110> sunblock<00:04:13.620> that<00:04:14.459> you

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
to be like a solid a sunblock that you

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.729 
to be like a solid a sunblock that you
apply<00:04:14.819> over<00:04:15.150> your<00:04:15.270> skin<00:04:15.810> after<00:04:16.109> your<00:04:16.470> skincare

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
apply over your skin after your skincare

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.490 
apply over your skin after your skincare
and<00:04:17.540> I<00:04:18.540> thought<00:04:18.989> this<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.290> interesting

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
and I thought this is interesting

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.190 
and I thought this is interesting
because<00:04:19.769> it<00:04:20.340> kind<00:04:21.060> of<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.510> texture<00:04:21.810> reminded

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
because it kind of the texture reminded

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.860 
because it kind of the texture reminded
me<00:04:22.290> of<00:04:22.320> like<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.680> primer<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:24.600> thought<00:04:24.780> it

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
me of like a primer so I thought it

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.960 
me of like a primer so I thought it
would<00:04:24.960> be<00:04:25.020> working<00:04:25.320> well<00:04:25.530> under<00:04:25.890> makeup<00:04:26.310> but

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
would be working well under makeup but

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:28.760 
would be working well under makeup but
that<00:04:27.120> is<00:04:27.210> not<00:04:27.480> the<00:04:27.630> case<00:04:27.810> I<00:04:28.169> feel<00:04:28.320> like<00:04:28.530> putting

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:28.770 
that is not the case I feel like putting

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.159 
that is not the case I feel like putting
this<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.190> her<00:04:29.280> makeup<00:04:29.550> make<00:04:30.270> sure<00:04:30.419> you<00:04:30.930> make<00:04:31.080> it

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
this on her makeup make sure you make it

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.370 
this on her makeup make sure you make it
a<00:04:31.230> little<00:04:31.380> kind<00:04:31.590> of<00:04:31.680> weird<00:04:31.980> and<00:04:32.960> the<00:04:33.960> thing<00:04:34.169> is

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
a little kind of weird and the thing is

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.340 
a little kind of weird and the thing is
I<00:04:35.060> really<00:04:36.060> recommend<00:04:36.450> this<00:04:36.570> if<00:04:36.780> you<00:04:36.930> have<00:04:37.110> good

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:37.350 
I really recommend this if you have good

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:39.950 
I really recommend this if you have good
skin<00:04:37.860> if<00:04:38.070> you<00:04:38.160> don't<00:04:38.430> wear<00:04:38.580> makeup<00:04:39.000> because<00:04:39.450> of

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
skin if you don't wear makeup because of

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.770 
skin if you don't wear makeup because of
the<00:04:40.370> texture<00:04:41.370> which<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:41.910> like<00:04:42.150> this<00:04:42.360> kind<00:04:42.690> of

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
the texture which is like this kind of

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:47.540 
the texture which is like this kind of
slippery<00:04:43.880> not<00:04:44.880> really<00:04:45.090> slippery<00:04:45.419> it's<00:04:46.550> it's

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
slippery not really slippery it's it's

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.300 
slippery not really slippery it's it's
very<00:04:47.669> poor<00:04:48.360> refining<00:04:48.960> its<00:04:49.260> kind<00:04:49.530> of<00:04:49.590> it's<00:04:50.130> like

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
very poor refining its kind of it's like

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:51.890 
very poor refining its kind of it's like
a<00:04:50.340> primer<00:04:50.640> but<00:04:51.240> it's<00:04:51.360> a<00:04:51.390> little<00:04:51.570> more<00:04:51.720> solid

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
a primer but it's a little more solid

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:55.700 
a primer but it's a little more solid
the<00:04:52.560> texture<00:04:53.010> really<00:04:53.970> softens<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.169> skin<00:04:55.200> and

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
the texture really softens the skin and

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.640 
the texture really softens the skin and
smooths<00:04:55.890> it<00:04:56.190> out<00:04:56.510> but<00:04:57.510> I<00:04:57.840> feel<00:04:58.169> like<00:04:58.260> you<00:04:58.410> can't

00:04:58.640 --> 00:04:58.650 
smooths it out but I feel like you can't

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.960 
smooths it out but I feel like you can't
put<00:04:58.680> makeup<00:04:58.919> on<00:04:59.040> top<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.340> because<00:04:59.610> then<00:04:59.880> it

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
put makeup on top of because then it

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.000 
put makeup on top of because then it
from<00:05:00.090> the<00:05:00.210> skin<00:05:00.600> the<00:05:01.020> makeup<00:05:01.560> kind<00:05:01.740> of<00:05:01.860> just

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:02.010 
from the skin the makeup kind of just

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:04.490 
from the skin the makeup kind of just
sits<00:05:02.250> on<00:05:02.370> top<00:05:02.550> of<00:05:02.610> it<00:05:02.850> and<00:05:03.120> eventually<00:05:03.780> over

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
sits on top of it and eventually over

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.020 
sits on top of it and eventually over
the<00:05:04.530> day<00:05:04.710> even<00:05:04.919> though<00:05:05.130> it<00:05:05.310> does<00:05:05.490> control<00:05:05.820> oil

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:06.030 
the day even though it does control oil

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.000 
the day even though it does control oil
because<00:05:06.810> I<00:05:06.870> notice<00:05:07.110> my<00:05:07.200> makeup<00:05:07.470> doesn't<00:05:07.710> um

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:08.010 
because I notice my makeup doesn't um

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:10.850 
because I notice my makeup doesn't um
get<00:05:08.490> oily<00:05:08.880> it<00:05:09.660> does<00:05:09.990> for<00:05:10.260> some<00:05:10.440> reason<00:05:10.710> like

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
get oily it does for some reason like

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.550 
get oily it does for some reason like
make<00:05:11.729> my<00:05:11.880> makeup<00:05:12.090> slip<00:05:12.720> easily<00:05:12.990> like<00:05:13.350> if<00:05:13.470> I

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
make my makeup slip easily like if I

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.469 
make my makeup slip easily like if I
touch<00:05:13.770> my<00:05:13.950> face<00:05:14.220> then<00:05:14.550> that<00:05:15.090> part<00:05:15.300> where<00:05:15.419> the

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
touch my face then that part where the

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.900 
touch my face then that part where the
makeup<00:05:15.600> was<00:05:15.840> at<00:05:16.020> like<00:05:16.200> type<00:05:16.440> slips<00:05:16.800> away<00:05:17.040> so<00:05:17.700> if

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:17.910 
makeup was at like type slips away so if

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:19.100 
makeup was at like type slips away so if
you<00:05:17.970> have<00:05:18.090> good<00:05:18.360> skin<00:05:18.570> that<00:05:18.780> I<00:05:18.840> really

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:19.110 
you have good skin that I really

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:21.500 
you have good skin that I really
recommend<00:05:19.410> it<00:05:19.500> because<00:05:20.210> you<00:05:21.210> know<00:05:21.300> if<00:05:21.419> you

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:21.510 
recommend it because you know if you

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:22.760 
recommend it because you know if you
don't<00:05:21.600> like<00:05:21.780> the<00:05:21.870> feeling<00:05:22.169> of<00:05:22.200> sunscreen<00:05:22.680> on

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
don't like the feeling of sunscreen on

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:24.440 
don't like the feeling of sunscreen on
your<00:05:22.860> face<00:05:22.919> just<00:05:23.669> popping<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:24.120> on<00:05:24.270> all<00:05:24.419> over

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
your face just popping this on all over

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.480 
your face just popping this on all over
and<00:05:24.990> it's<00:05:25.110> clear<00:05:25.470> it<00:05:25.680> doesn't<00:05:26.100> leave<00:05:26.280> like<00:05:26.460> a

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
and it's clear it doesn't leave like a

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.590 
and it's clear it doesn't leave like a
white<00:05:26.840> cast<00:05:27.840> on<00:05:28.020> your<00:05:28.140> face<00:05:28.520> and<00:05:29.520> it's<00:05:30.240> easy<00:05:30.450> to

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:30.600 
white cast on your face and it's easy to

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.710 
white cast on your face and it's easy to
take<00:05:30.780> with<00:05:31.080> you<00:05:31.140> for<00:05:31.560> touch-ups<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:33.240> really

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:33.720 
take with you for touch-ups I really

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.270 
take with you for touch-ups I really
recommend<00:05:34.080> it<00:05:34.169> but<00:05:34.229> if<00:05:34.350> you<00:05:34.500> are<00:05:34.860> a<00:05:34.890> makeup

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:35.280 
recommend it but if you are a makeup

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.550 
recommend it but if you are a makeup
wearer<00:05:35.700> I<00:05:36.060> would<00:05:36.540> probably<00:05:36.720> invest<00:05:37.229> like<00:05:37.350> in<00:05:37.500> a

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
wearer I would probably invest like in a

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.710 
wearer I would probably invest like in a
different<00:05:37.919> sunscreen<00:05:38.370> for<00:05:38.610> it<00:05:38.729> for<00:05:39.630> under

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:39.720 
different sunscreen for it for under

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.210 
different sunscreen for it for under
your<00:05:39.930> makeup<00:05:40.080> and<00:05:40.410> that<00:05:40.470> doesn't<00:05:40.800> disturb<00:05:41.070> it

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
your makeup and that doesn't disturb it

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:43.460 
your makeup and that doesn't disturb it
like<00:05:41.340> this<00:05:41.490> does<00:05:41.810> and<00:05:42.810> there's<00:05:43.110> not<00:05:43.229> really<00:05:43.380> a

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
like this does and there's not really a

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.940 
like this does and there's not really a
scent<00:05:44.540> it's<00:05:45.540> a<00:05:45.600> very<00:05:45.810> faint<00:05:46.140> cologne<00:05:46.590> smell

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:46.950 
scent it's a very faint cologne smell

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.340 
scent it's a very faint cologne smell
but<00:05:47.220> it<00:05:48.060> just<00:05:48.270> makes<00:05:48.450> your<00:05:48.570> skin<00:05:48.630> very<00:05:48.960> soft

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
but it just makes your skin very soft

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:51.650 
but it just makes your skin very soft
and<00:05:49.740> smooth<00:05:50.100> and<00:05:50.400> I<00:05:50.640> like<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.150> wake<00:05:51.240> my<00:05:51.330> skin

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:51.660 
and smooth and I like to wake my skin

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.969 
and smooth and I like to wake my skin
feels<00:05:51.870> right<00:05:51.960> after<00:05:52.200> I<00:05:52.260> use<00:05:52.350> it<00:05:52.530> I<00:05:52.620> just<00:05:52.830> don't

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:52.979 
feels right after I use it I just don't

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.400 
feels right after I use it I just don't
like<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:53.190> when<00:05:53.340> I<00:05:53.460> use<00:05:54.419> makeup<00:05:54.960> on<00:05:55.080> top<00:05:55.229> of<00:05:55.320> it
