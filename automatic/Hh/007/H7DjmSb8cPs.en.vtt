00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.900
 The ObermÃ¼hle ten years are available in three different power levels and 1 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.649
 3 different designs 

00:00:10.649 --> 00:00:13.239
 initially only 100 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:18.590
 Priesthood still 125 and this Reaper 200 before both numbers the 

00:00:18.589 --> 00:00:20.769
 Describes performance levels 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:28.720
 as Realo 100 times 100 Office of a Netherlands it is true to have 125 125 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.050
 and @ the Reaper 200 times 200 Grand Prix continues 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:34.760
 inexpensive per minute 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.190
 now we know the virtues the sixth time factory anyway the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.410
 Theoretical now wants to show how easy it is the sixth time work 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.740
 exchange 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.070
 At first it seemed as if that was also for me 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.960
 nevertheless it is so that the stones 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.100
 also finally said to create itself so it is better if she is light 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.930
 Avoid injury to put on gloves 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.250
 The last time it sounds there is an accessory available 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.920
 it consists of 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.000
 In general, they will not be able to agree on the machine 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.300
 not the coach 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.980
 with the brush 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.340
 so that the guests third of the Neves is good except Malka Mai out 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.040
 burdened here 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 the standing stone 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:28.120
 Who wants it especially that we do not want in the future Amy Winehouse is supposed to 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.880
 for the user a process day 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.980
 again settled in with it 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.040
 DeMille can exhaust thoroughly through photos 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.340
 of course we have the tool a commercial - 5 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.000
 Bohmann to solve the dispute 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.930
 First, unplug the power plug when the next time you meet 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.960
 watch the judges turn 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.960
 the New York Senate 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.580
 take that 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:01.580
 existing ones rise below it 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.580
 it can be something important 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.470
 they can solve the Bremen stone 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.519
 however, it is 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.899
 will not counterclockwise 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:12.889
 together 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:16.619
 and pointers are normally fixed in a clockwise direction 

00:02:17.749 --> 00:02:20.439
 I think they have a romance too 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.549
 hold the stone tight 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:24.589
 and turn the screw 

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:27.589
 the 16 USD 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.559
 now 

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:39.879
 if you go up the chamber in the 2 on both sides 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:44.979
 and can you do that in time together 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.979
 it will be out of miller 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:55.219
 That's the first version 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:59.759
 in the second version 

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:02.759
 how do you see the funnel? 

00:03:03.499 --> 00:03:06.499
 because 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.239
 "We have to decide 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.209
 and take a commercial tape 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.699
 Vienna 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:20.699
 that she attacks under the stones 

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:25.029
 the stone out 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:33.139
 at 

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:41.269
 then if they have taken the coach's questions out 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.230
 take the chamber out of it 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.709
 the third variant is probably the fastest 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:49.649
 however, they are willing 7 

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:52.329
 really exceptional cases only in the whole country 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:53.529
 perform 

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:56.659
 they are shedding judges 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:03:57.899
 above 

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:00.899
 nevertheless, they are down in stone 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.009
 DAPD 

00:04:07.009 --> 00:04:10.009
 the race finish the screw big 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.229
 and now they live the mill 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:17.229
 Sharp stone holds out they have seen 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.900
 that's a feather with come out 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.509
 very important 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.240
 that put the two holes together the mistakes 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.240
 League used 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.180
 so 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.770
 Election campaign ends 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.770
 use 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.419
 so that the holes are free 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:48.840
 everyone use 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.539
 Thieves stole 

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:52.020
 has one escape 

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.939
 the groove 

00:04:53.939 --> 00:04:56.029
 in this market is back 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:04:59.029
 Set engine oils 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:01.069
 the screwdrivers 

00:05:01.069 --> 00:05:03.770
 with the disc 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.800
 turn counterclockwise in the opposite direction 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.110
 and then with the tools 

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:15.999
 tangible action 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.059
 even if it weighs heavily the first time, they do not believe it 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:27.610
 after two to three years 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:28.900
 Change predecessor 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:32.030
 the change process takes maybe a minute 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:33.889
 a maximum of 2 

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:35.229
