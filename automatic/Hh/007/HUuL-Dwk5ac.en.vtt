00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.200

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.610

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:37.690

 I'm 19 years old 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:48.220
 I live in a country house in the village of bam bam 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:50.410
 no country back 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.920
 my only good luck in life is tadic 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.360
 the most beautiful girl 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:57.840
 we love each other more than anything else 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.730
 probably this area 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.290
 and that one night 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.710
 on the verge of falling 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.030
 I decided to make her an offer 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.110
 clear one from the other for only a couple of seconds 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.330
 to collect your thoughts 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.440
 ooo sovfrakht 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.440
 in this house were successful 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.030
 I was scared 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.360
 came running back the tree 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.980
 and began to call for help 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:24.270
 nobody was in trouble 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.270
 everyone slept in themselves 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.780
 and then for one of the houses I went dez gun 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.510
 I feel that the plane 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:34.260
 stared 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.420
 say nothing of course the contract for 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.310

 I don't know well 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
 recall that washington 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.310
 men will be turned into 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.310
 real press 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.710
 tass but 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.250
 we walked all night you didn't say a word 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.590
 Who are you 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.079
 why don't you help 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:11.639
 look under your feet 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.479
 listen to the victory details my life 

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:15.969
 you don't need to know 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:18.969
 today Vasily Petrovich a year later 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:22.339
 very nice 7am 

00:02:22.339 --> 00:02:23.659
 my name is school 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.479
 we have to meet you 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:27.789
 I absolutely do not care to leave the hall 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:30.289
 was full i decided to help you and 6 

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.930
 sense of civic duty 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.530
 because of some personal motivation there so 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.859
 that do not throw speeches 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:37.990
 Vasily Petrovich 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.019
 but as a beginner you know where to go 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:42.719
 2010 will be 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.719
 what can the group do year by 

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:49.059
 I hope everything is fine 

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:52.169
 she didn't get 

00:02:52.169 --> 00:02:55.649
 that's what I'm telling you about enter from speeches 

00:02:55.649 --> 00:02:57.239
 so it's time to introduce a few 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.070
 truth be to avoid conflicts between us 

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.979
 and further 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:04.259
 but number one executable orders 

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:07.049
 implicitly three points 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:09.029
 May 14 

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:11.589
 where to start it right 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.339
 with a frightened need to listen 

00:03:14.339 --> 00:03:17.119
 so that to give orders 

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:19.509
 if the person is past 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.289
 stand in front of such a meeting 

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:25.289
 I think that I have no advantages 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:30.569
 but with the question of arrest benefit products 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:32.689
 the second rule is not only 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.849
 by name and patronymic and handed out became older 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.319
 eventually 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.319
 because the last rules 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.950
 4 pages 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.589
 for the first time after four matches 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:54.569
 contribution replenished 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:57.569
 but priests especially since we will 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:16.590
 stand taxes these goals what is the case 

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.870
 what exactly is Vasily Petrovich 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.870
 here yagtu I mean 

00:04:25.879 --> 00:04:28.169
 people help me 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:30.449
 for smart will forget 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:33.229
 mob of thugs 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:35.680
 forget sergey 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.680
 I do not know that they do not need it 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:40.789
 the main thing he wants 

00:04:40.789 --> 00:04:42.389
 everything will be fine 

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:45.490
 with 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.400
 went to 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.580
 we saw an innocent man 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.830
 for something 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.279
 if you even earlier 

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:57.400
 try to explain why they did it 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.370
 for this guy drives those who want to pass 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.439
 do something bad to him 

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:04.070
 so now have not come yet 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.190
 transit between them Zimin very large 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.140
 so there is a high probability that they 

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:12.539
 would not have caught up with him even better 

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:14.099
 until why 

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:15.460
 i think he 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.780
 kill him now when they come we 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.199
 get a lot thanks even 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.800
 maybe something valuable 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.900
 this award for our help 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.759
 so that is all logical 

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.710
 I would get a lot of experience during 

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:30.320
 diseases 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.480
 so you can never say 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:35.849
 mistaken 

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:37.199
 part espresso 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.199
 in Kiev 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.099
 great men this time caught came out of 

00:05:44.099 --> 00:05:48.029
 Syria is the real author of the books until then 

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:51.339
 nothing is known 

00:05:51.339 --> 00:05:54.009
 may thank even more fulfilled 

00:05:54.009 --> 00:05:55.360
 your civic duty 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.520
 and 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.810
 so for secret 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:59.360
 civil matters 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.360
 I know what I will do is worth the money 

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.199
 Listen to me 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.520
 that is, up to four ensued a thousand 

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.219
 dollars 

00:06:08.219 --> 00:06:11.219
 then just to talk 

00:06:11.949 --> 00:06:15.550
 they say the year has grown bearded among 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.650
 owed each of us a bag of gold and 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:19.980
 still buried 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.980
 and only gave where is in the hospital 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:25.219
 another 4 4 

00:06:25.219 --> 00:06:26.370
 Vasily Petrovich 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:28.949
 In my opinion in this situation, you are wrong 

00:06:28.949 --> 00:06:31.740
 guys Transcarpathian these freaks 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:34.740
 apparently 

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.779
 sat down thought that the government 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:47.159
 what are you doing
