the<00:00:50.070> 2012<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:51.629> mean<00:00:52.410> 2013<00:00:53.250> mr.<00:00:53.489> Olympia<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.879> a

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
the 2012 I mean 2013 mr. Olympia in a

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.229 
the 2012 I mean 2013 mr. Olympia in a
212<00:00:54.300> class<00:00:55.699> transitioning<00:00:56.699> from<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.000> open

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
212 class transitioning from the open

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.450 
212 class transitioning from the open
class<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.690> this<00:00:57.840> one<00:00:58.079> which<00:00:58.920> i<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.160> is

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
class of this one which i think is

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.099 
class of this one which i think is
extremely<00:01:00.059> tough<00:01:00.449> it's<00:01:00.660> not<00:01:00.809> going<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:01.020> be

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
extremely tough it's not going to be

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.579 
extremely tough it's not going to be
easy<00:01:01.199> task<00:01:01.530> because<00:01:01.710> i<00:01:01.890> think<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.190> 212<00:01:02.640> class

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:03.589 
easy task because i think the 212 class

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:06.140 
easy task because i think the 212 class
has<00:01:04.589> a<00:01:04.619> more<00:01:04.949> dynamic<00:01:05.159> class<00:01:05.790> because

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
has a more dynamic class because

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.359 
has a more dynamic class because
everybody<00:01:06.600> comes<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:06.990> condition<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
everybody comes in condition and it

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.190 
everybody comes in condition and it
really<00:01:08.549> balanced<00:01:09.150> so<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.510> it's<00:01:09.869> going<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
really balanced so it's it's going to be

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.969 
really balanced so it's it's going to be
very<00:01:10.229> difficult<00:01:10.610> but<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> like<00:01:11.880> my<00:01:12.030> chances<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
very difficult but I like my chances so

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.350 
very difficult but I like my chances so
I'm<00:01:13.979> just<00:01:14.189> staying<00:01:14.400> the<00:01:14.580> course<00:01:14.729> right<00:01:15.000> now<00:01:15.150> by
