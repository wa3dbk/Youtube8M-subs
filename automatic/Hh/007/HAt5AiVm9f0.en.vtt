and I think the only thing before we
going<00:01:15.730> to<00:01:15.790> change<00:01:16.030> for<00:01:16.210> tomorrow<00:01:16.360> is<00:01:16.750> the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
going to change for tomorrow is the

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.110 
going to change for tomorrow is the
targets<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.530> change<00:01:17.800> location<00:01:18.400> so<00:01:18.910> we're<00:01:19.090> just

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:19.120 
targets of change location so we're just

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:20.580 
targets of change location so we're just
going<00:01:19.360> to<00:01:19.390> work<00:01:19.690> on<00:01:19.870> to<00:01:19.990> my<00:01:20.080> rhythms<00:01:20.470> and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
going to work on to my rhythms and

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.560 
going to work on to my rhythms and
hopefully<00:01:20.980> things<00:01:21.430> go<00:01:21.640> well<00:01:21.820> then<00:01:22.510> you

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:22.570 
hopefully things go well then you

pretty well today so that's a pretty
good<00:01:25.690> indication<00:01:26.080> of<00:01:26.230> where<00:01:26.380> we're<00:01:26.500> going<00:01:26.620> to

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
good indication of where we're going to

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.520 
good indication of where we're going to
be<00:01:27.300> Virginia<00:01:28.300> Tech<00:01:28.360> had<00:01:28.690> no<00:01:28.840> problem<00:01:29.320> with<00:01:29.350> the

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.230 
make it to the channel so Paul how'd it

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.780 
make it to the channel so Paul how'd it
go<00:01:47.320> for<00:01:47.470> Hokies<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:48.010> think<00:01:48.460> I<00:01:48.520> remember<00:01:48.550> I'm

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
go for Hokies I think I remember I'm

go for Hokies I think I remember I'm
very<00:01:49.000> well<00:01:49.180> we<00:01:49.720> went<00:01:50.200> through<00:01:50.380> speed<00:01:50.650> gates

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
very well we went through speed gates

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.560 
very well we went through speed gates
and<00:01:51.070> got<00:01:51.159> the<00:01:51.310> ring<00:01:51.490> perfectly<00:01:51.909> fine<00:01:52.060> probably

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
and got the ring perfectly fine probably

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.060 
and got the ring perfectly fine probably
about<00:01:52.659> four<00:01:52.930> times<00:01:53.110> so<00:01:53.409> that's<00:01:53.590> not<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.800> problem

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
about four times so that's not a problem

GPS point over at that blue booing and
circling<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.150> so<00:01:58.510> that's<00:01:58.630> what<00:01:58.720> we're<00:01:58.810> gonna

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
circling it so that's what we're gonna

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.180 
circling it so that's what we're gonna

about ten minutes before I run we lost
our<00:03:41.630> compass<00:03:41.959> so<00:03:42.319> we<00:03:42.829> did<00:03:43.040> this<00:03:43.310> a<00:03:43.370> little<00:03:43.489> bit

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:43.670 
our compass so we did this a little bit

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:45.400 
our compass so we did this a little bit
of<00:03:43.730> dead<00:03:43.880> reckoning<00:03:44.090> as<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.930> guys<00:03:45.109> saw<00:03:45.350> the

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
of dead reckoning as you guys saw the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.559 
of dead reckoning as you guys saw the
ballasting<00:03:46.310> for<00:03:46.609> it<00:03:46.730> it's<00:03:46.940> a<00:03:47.030> little<00:03:47.209> off<00:03:47.359> with

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
ballasting for it it's a little off with

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.030

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
and payloads so tonight we're gonna try

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.680 
and payloads so tonight we're gonna try
to<00:03:51.500> figure<00:03:51.680> that<00:03:51.889> out

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
to figure that out

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.050 
to figure that out
we'll<00:03:52.990> run<00:03:53.140> tomorrow<00:03:53.530> last<00:03:54.460> year's<00:03:54.730> winners

objects of interest in the water which

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.840 
objects of interest in the water which
means<00:04:20.110> that<00:04:20.350> we<00:04:20.530> should<00:04:20.739> have<00:04:21.040> a<00:04:21.370> repeatable

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
means that we should have a repeatable

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:23.880 
means that we should have a repeatable
performance<00:04:22.480> for<00:04:22.660> those<00:04:22.780> parts<00:04:23.140> we<00:04:23.590> had<00:04:23.740> some

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
performance for those parts we had some

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:25.980 
performance for those parts we had some
camera<00:04:24.190> issues<00:04:24.550> there<00:04:25.180> in<00:04:25.600> the<00:04:25.660> middle<00:04:25.870> for

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
camera issues there in the middle for

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:27.330 
camera issues there in the middle for
the<00:04:26.050> buoy<00:04:26.200> NAB<00:04:26.470> and<00:04:26.680> then<00:04:26.770> we<00:04:26.860> also<00:04:27.010> had<00:04:27.250> some

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:27.340 
the buoy NAB and then we also had some

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.450 
the buoy NAB and then we also had some
GPS<00:04:27.730> issues<00:04:28.060> at<00:04:28.240> the<00:04:28.330> end<00:04:28.450> but<00:04:29.130> we<00:04:30.130> can<00:04:30.280> tweak

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
GPS issues at the end but we can tweak

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.010 
GPS issues at the end but we can tweak
those<00:04:30.580> values<00:04:31.060> but<00:04:31.390> we<00:04:31.510> think<00:04:31.690> we've<00:04:31.780> got<00:04:31.930> the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
those values but we think we've got the

we<00:05:32.830> made<00:05:33.070> it<00:05:33.100> through<00:05:33.340> the<00:05:33.520> speed<00:05:33.910> gates<00:05:34.150> we

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:34.780 
we made it through the speed gates we

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:36.390 
we made it through the speed gates we
had<00:05:35.260> some<00:05:35.470> problems<00:05:35.800> with<00:05:35.860> one<00:05:36.220> of<00:05:36.340> our

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
had some problems with one of our

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.550 
had some problems with one of our
sensors<00:05:36.790> drifting<00:05:37.540> and<00:05:37.690> freezing<00:05:38.200> so<00:05:38.380> we're

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
sensors drifting and freezing so we're

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.820

gonna<00:05:38.650> be<00:05:39.120> trying<00:05:40.120> to<00:05:40.270> fix<00:05:41.050> that<00:05:41.230> problem<00:05:41.380> and

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
gonna be trying to fix that problem and

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.129 
gonna be trying to fix that problem and
at<00:05:42.610> least<00:05:42.700> get<00:05:42.880> the<00:05:43.000> ring<00:05:43.150> the<00:05:43.270> next<00:05:43.480> go-around

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:44.139 
at least get the ring the next go-around

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:46.709 
at least get the ring the next go-around
and<00:05:44.310> finally<00:05:45.310> ODU<00:05:45.879> technology<00:05:46.509> had<00:05:46.689> a

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
after six attempts hopefully they can

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.659 
after six attempts hopefully they can
pull<00:05:52.840> it<00:05:52.930> together<00:05:53.050> tomorrow<00:05:53.560> well<00:05:54.430> look<00:05:54.550> like

pull it together tomorrow well look like

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:56.909 
pull it together tomorrow well look like
a<00:05:54.699> rough<00:05:55.300> first<00:05:55.449> run<00:05:55.689> guys<00:05:55.900> one<00:05:56.169> wrong<00:05:56.349> um

00:05:56.909 --> 00:05:56.919 
a rough first run guys one wrong um

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.920 
a rough first run guys one wrong um
particularly<00:05:57.759> it<00:05:57.999> was<00:05:58.150> a<00:05:58.180> vision<00:05:58.479> system

00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:58.930

detection<00:05:59.349> at<00:05:59.439> the<00:05:59.499> moment<00:05:59.860> it<00:06:00.039> I<00:06:00.430> think<00:06:00.789> the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
detection at the moment it I think the

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:02.689 
detection at the moment it I think the
red<00:06:01.240> is<00:06:01.360> getting<00:06:01.539> out<00:06:01.629> of<00:06:01.659> you<00:06:01.870> the<00:06:01.960> camera<00:06:02.409> and
