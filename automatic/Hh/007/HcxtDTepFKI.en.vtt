00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.400
 David 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.170
 Theme of the third day 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.020
 self-presentation of the sale of their services 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.340
 combine master classes and what they will give 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.980
 personal 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.410
 from partners you get a secret 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.250
 information 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.850
 I am ready to share my own 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.030
 groundwork 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.200
 creating and holding weddings 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.190
 often such on from are perceived as 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.820
 fly give intellectual 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.280
 However, in my opinion 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.170
 This information is very useful and should be 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470
 available to all who are not interested 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.020
 secondly you raise their level in your 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.200
 memoirs 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.220
 I believe that we get new knowledge 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.330
 can really raise those 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.700
 their income 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:14.860
 and the challenge is not so much to 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:17.080
 after master classes and started asking 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.610
 more money for your services 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.220
 but rather the quality of the machines 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.220
 allowed to earn 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.140
 you will learn the technique of self-presentation 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:29.920
 sales of their 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.060
 sometimes it is much more complicated than the date 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.530
 holding a very responsible 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.560
 events and this little weakness 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.070
 significantly affects income 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:41.970
 let's do a self-presentation 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.180
 your forte 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.240
 and fourth, you will get a certificate 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.940
 passing master class 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.610

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.960
