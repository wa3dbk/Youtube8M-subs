 Y 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.560
 the good thing about pumpkins is that there is a 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.450
 great variety and you can get them 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.730
 throughout the year 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:39.030
 the spaghetti squash is one of my 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.760
 favorite side very well the pumpkin the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.330
 cut in half and I extract their 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330
 seeds 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.870
 I'm preparing this pumpkin 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.500
 for my baby I have only added one 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.510
 little pinch of salt and oil but if the 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.840
 you want to prepare for other members of 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.589
 your family can add more flavor 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.449
 adding fresh herbs 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.960
 you can prepare the maybe bittersweet is 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:10.409
 one of my favorite preparations with 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.380
 lemon and orange is delicious led her 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:17.460
 baked and let it cook around 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:22.880
 45 to 60 minutes and the oven is 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.880
 previously heated to 350 

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.140
 these spaghetti require a 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.900
 delicious sauce so the sauce that 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.110
 prepare on this occasion was with 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:45.770
 cauliflower and spinach you can also 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:49.070
 Broccoli is delicious to use the 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.270
 I steam up and put them in my 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.770
 mincer with a little bit of oil 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.510
 I regularly use coconut oil or 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.510
 linseed oil 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.710
 and also added a little bit of substance 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.860
 or vegetable broth you can also 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:10.340
 use chicken or any other 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:12.230
 substance of your preference and what 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.960
 I do is crush these ingredients 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.960
 until they are in a creamy sauce 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:25.660
 and ready that easy and fast is that 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:30.010
