on<00:00:11.620> the<00:00:11.740> bottom<00:00:12.129> a<00:00:15.539> little<00:00:16.539> bit<00:00:16.720> of<00:00:16.840> clearance

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
on the bottom a little bit of clearance

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.849 
on the bottom a little bit of clearance
you<00:00:18.599> know<00:00:19.599> saying<00:00:19.930> I<00:00:20.050> just<00:00:20.080> got<00:00:20.410> to<00:00:20.500> figure<00:00:20.830> out

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:20.859 
you know saying I just got to figure out

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:23.849 
you know saying I just got to figure out
what<00:00:21.070> to<00:00:21.220> do<00:00:21.369> with<00:00:21.460> these<00:00:21.670> wires<00:00:21.939> very<00:00:22.180> head

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
what to do with these wires very head

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.009 
what to do with these wires very head
I<00:00:23.890> think<00:00:24.670> the<00:00:24.759> body's<00:00:25.119> gonna<00:00:25.330> create<00:00:25.599> that<00:00:25.810> but

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.019 
I think the body's gonna create that but

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.410 
I think the body's gonna create that but
we<00:00:26.169> find<00:00:26.439> out

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:29.420

Norma<00:00:30.230> have<00:00:30.380> the<00:00:30.530> receiver<00:00:30.920> box<00:00:31.190> cover

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
Norma have the receiver box cover

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.240 
Norma have the receiver box cover
I<00:00:33.550> did<00:00:34.239> a<00:00:34.270> nice<00:00:34.510> clean<00:00:34.960> wiring<00:00:35.440> job<00:00:35.649> I<00:00:35.860> got<00:00:36.070> rid

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:36.250 
I did a nice clean wiring job I got rid

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.170 
I did a nice clean wiring job I got rid
of<00:00:36.280> that<00:00:36.399> that<00:00:36.879> centerpiece<00:00:37.469> here<00:00:38.469> because

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
of that that centerpiece here because

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.710 
of that that centerpiece here because
it's<00:00:40.180> kind<00:00:40.360> of<00:00:40.480> difficult<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:43.000> you<00:00:43.300> know<00:00:43.420> pass

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:43.720

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:45.330 
it's kind of difficult to you know pass
the<00:00:43.930> wires<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.530> so<00:00:44.739> I<00:00:44.829> got<00:00:45.010> rid<00:00:45.129> of<00:00:45.190> that

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
the wires to so I got rid of that

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:52.590 
the wires to so I got rid of that
cleared<00:00:46.059> that<00:00:46.269> out<00:00:47.399> see<00:00:48.399> that<00:00:51.390> that's<00:00:52.390> the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:52.600 
cleared that out see that that's the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.200 
cleared that out see that that's the
servo<00:00:52.899> right<00:00:53.019> there<00:00:53.470> high-tech

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.130 

565<00:00:57.210> mhm<00:00:57.690> I<00:01:00.800> mounted

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:03.140 
565 mhm I mounted

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.060 
565 mhm I mounted
on<00:01:03.710> BC<00:01:04.280> I<00:01:04.720> already<00:01:05.720> had<00:01:05.900> the<00:01:06.050> cap<00:01:06.260> back<00:01:06.530> on<00:01:06.740> so<00:01:07.010> I

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
on BC I already had the cap back on so I

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.170 
on BC I already had the cap back on so I
just<00:01:07.280> ran<00:01:07.460> the<00:01:07.490> wires<00:01:07.820> to<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.300> he's<00:01:09.230> shrinking

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:10.180 
just ran the wires to the he's shrinking

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.690 
just ran the wires to the he's shrinking
soldered<00:01:11.180> them<00:01:11.330> right<00:01:11.510> onto<00:01:11.720> the<00:01:11.990> tabs<00:01:12.700> for

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
soldered them right onto the tabs for

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.330 
soldered them right onto the tabs for
the<00:01:13.820> battery<00:01:14.150> my<00:01:14.630> own<00:01:14.870> the<00:01:15.620> battery<00:01:15.980> plug<00:01:16.190> the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
the battery my own the battery plug the

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.080 
the battery my own the battery plug the
deans<00:01:16.580> connected<00:01:18.370> then<00:01:19.370> he<00:01:19.460> knows<00:01:19.670> too<00:01:19.850> tight

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
deans connected then he knows too tight

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.080 
deans connected then he knows too tight
squeezing<00:01:20.660> hair<00:01:20.840> ready<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:22.310> i<00:01:22.340> mounted<00:01:22.820> it<00:01:22.910> on

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
squeezing hair ready so i mounted it on

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:26.650 
squeezing hair ready so i mounted it on
the<00:01:23.240> side<00:01:23.570> of<00:01:23.750> my<00:01:24.170> ESC<00:01:24.740> I<00:01:25.210> think<00:01:26.210> it's<00:01:26.360> kind<00:01:26.540> of

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:26.660 
the side of my ESC I think it's kind of

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.200 
the side of my ESC I think it's kind of
clean<00:01:26.900> I'm<00:01:27.890> a<00:01:27.979> white<00:01:28.190> my<00:01:28.400> only<00:01:28.729> no<00:01:28.910> switch

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
clean I'm a white my only no switch

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.810 
clean I'm a white my only no switch
right<00:01:29.450> over<00:01:29.479> Lake<00:01:30.020> about<00:01:30.200> not<00:01:30.860> that<00:01:31.100> far<00:01:31.400> maybe

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
right over Lake about not that far maybe

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.120 
right over Lake about not that far maybe
but<00:01:32.120> here<00:01:32.540> I<00:01:33.670> did<00:01:35.229> extra<00:01:36.229> battery<00:01:36.590> tray<00:01:36.890> on<00:01:37.040> the

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
but here I did extra battery tray on the

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.680 
but here I did extra battery tray on the
top<00:01:37.400> I<00:01:38.200> noticed<00:01:39.200> that<00:01:39.380> all<00:01:39.460> nanotech<00:01:40.690> the

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:41.690 
top I noticed that all nanotech the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.280 
top I noticed that all nanotech the
turning<00:01:42.170> inside<00:01:42.320> battery<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.040> quite<00:01:43.340> long<00:01:43.580> so

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:44.290 
turning inside battery is quite long so

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:49.690 
turning inside battery is quite long so
I'm<00:01:45.290> probably<00:01:45.560> gonna<00:01:45.830> have<00:01:46.070> to

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.260 

cut<00:01:50.180> this<00:01:50.390> down<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:51.200> front<00:01:51.500> piece<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.270> I'll

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
cut this down this front piece and I'll

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.380 
cut this down this front piece and I'll
get<00:01:53.540> some<00:01:53.720> velcro<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:55.490> I'll<00:01:55.670> put<00:01:55.909> velcro<00:01:56.120> on

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
get some velcro and I'll put velcro on

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.040 
get some velcro and I'll put velcro on
the<00:01:56.479> battery<00:01:56.900> that<00:01:57.590> velcro<00:01:58.100> on<00:01:58.220> the<00:01:58.250> tray<00:01:58.640> and

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
the battery that velcro on the tray and

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.270 
the battery that velcro on the tray and
that'll<00:02:00.050> keep<00:02:00.170> it<00:02:00.320> in<00:02:00.409> place<00:02:00.680> along<00:02:01.040> with<00:02:01.070> the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that'll keep it in place along with the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.080 
that'll keep it in place along with the
straps

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:04.090 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.580

in there

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.320 
in there
this<00:02:46.850> thing<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:47.209> heavy<00:02:47.600> no<00:02:49.030> it's<00:02:50.030> heavy

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
this thing is heavy no it's heavy

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.810 
this thing is heavy no it's heavy
without<00:02:50.690> the<00:02:50.870> wheels<00:02:51.110> without<00:02:52.010> the<00:02:52.340> batteries

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
without the wheels without the batteries

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.680 
without the wheels without the batteries
so<00:02:53.780> I<00:02:53.810> don't<00:02:54.050> think<00:02:54.260> this<00:02:54.410> is<00:02:54.440> gonna<00:02:54.739> airborne

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
so I don't think this is gonna airborne

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.060 
so I don't think this is gonna airborne
then<00:02:56.690> I<00:02:56.750> cut<00:02:57.110> out<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.260> hole<00:02:57.590> here<00:02:57.890> in<00:02:58.010> the

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
then I cut out the hole here in the

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.350 
then I cut out the hole here in the
front

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
front

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.160 
front
and<00:03:00.990> I<00:03:01.260> got<00:03:01.440> my<00:03:01.590> weights<00:03:01.830> in<00:03:02.070> there<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:03.360> way<00:03:03.540> I

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and I got my weights in there that way I

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:05.480 
and I got my weights in there that way I
know<00:03:04.410> if<00:03:04.530> I<00:03:04.590> was<00:03:04.710> going<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.920> need<00:03:05.010> it<00:03:05.160> I<00:03:05.250> figured

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
know if I was going to need it I figured

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.980 
know if I was going to need it I figured
if<00:03:05.670> I<00:03:05.790> needed<00:03:06.060> I<00:03:06.210> will<00:03:06.330> have<00:03:06.480> the<00:03:06.630> space

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
if I needed I will have the space

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:13.190 
if I needed I will have the space
available<00:03:07.400> to<00:03:08.400> add<00:03:08.580> more<00:03:08.940> weights<00:03:11.300> but<00:03:12.300> the

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 
available to add more weights but the

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.350 
available to add more weights but the
weight<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:13.650> thing<00:03:15.320> it's<00:03:16.320> quite<00:03:16.590> heavy

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:17.360 
weight of this thing it's quite heavy

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.580 
weight of this thing it's quite heavy
then<00:03:18.360> again<00:03:18.630> the<00:03:18.750> front<00:03:18.930> end<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.290> kind<00:03:19.320> of

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
then again the front end it's kind of

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.320 
then again the front end it's kind of
light<00:03:19.800> it's<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.040> back<00:03:20.310> end<00:03:20.610> that's<00:03:20.760> heavy

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
light it's the back end that's heavy

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.410 
light it's the back end that's heavy
oh<00:03:21.590> yeah<00:03:22.590> that's<00:03:22.800> what's<00:03:22.980> up<00:03:23.460> no<00:03:23.940> I'm<00:03:24.000> saying<00:03:24.210> I

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
if I'm gonna use this receiver cuz I was

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.740 
if I'm gonna use this receiver cuz I was
wondering<00:05:04.920> if<00:05:05.010> I<00:05:05.130> was<00:05:05.340> bugging<00:05:05.610> every<00:05:06.510> time<00:05:06.720> I

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
wondering if I was bugging every time I

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:10.190 
wondering if I was bugging every time I
used<00:05:07.140> the<00:05:07.320> flask<00:05:07.620> igg3<00:05:08.400> be<00:05:08.850> that<00:05:09.180> I<00:05:09.450> noticed<00:05:09.990> us

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:10.200 
used the flask igg3 be that I noticed us

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.090 
used the flask igg3 be that I noticed us
a<00:05:10.610> delay<00:05:11.610> and<00:05:11.940> it's<00:05:12.510> not<00:05:12.690> like<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.170> millisecond

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
a delay and it's not like a millisecond

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.790 
a delay and it's not like a millisecond
it's<00:05:14.310> like<00:05:14.490> a<00:05:14.520> long<00:05:15.360> delay<00:05:15.750> from<00:05:16.260> when<00:05:16.320> I<00:05:16.470> press

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
it's like a long delay from when I press

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.380 
it's like a long delay from when I press
the<00:05:16.950> throttle<00:05:17.190> so<00:05:17.550> when<00:05:17.670> it<00:05:17.790> moves<00:05:17.970> from<00:05:18.240> when

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:18.390 
the throttle so when it moves from when

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:21.110 
the throttle so when it moves from when
I<00:05:18.420> braked<00:05:18.920> everything<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:20.010> do<00:05:20.070> is<00:05:20.370> a<00:05:20.400> delay<00:05:20.850> at

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
I braked everything I do is a delay at

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.750 
I braked everything I do is a delay at
it<00:05:21.420> from<00:05:21.570> long<00:05:21.720> distance<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:22.500> that<00:05:23.310> makes<00:05:23.610> me

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
it from long distance and that makes me

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.550 
it from long distance and that makes me
very<00:05:23.790> uncomfortable<00:05:24.180> you<00:05:24.840> know<00:05:24.960> I<00:05:24.990> mean<00:05:25.230> so
