00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
this end right here with four little

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.070 
this end right here with four little
markings<00:03:48.610> that's<00:03:49.150> going<00:03:49.330> to<00:03:49.390> go<00:03:49.510> on<00:03:49.540> this<00:03:49.840> end

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:50.080 
markings that's going to go on this end

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.920 
markings that's going to go on this end
right<00:03:50.290> there<00:03:50.350> okay<00:03:51.010> now<00:03:51.820> there's<00:03:52.510> really<00:03:52.660> no

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
right there okay now there's really no

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.300 
right there okay now there's really no
easy<00:03:52.960> way<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.800> it's<00:03:54.010> sort<00:03:54.220> of

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
easy way to do this it's sort of

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.720 
easy way to do this it's sort of
difficult<00:03:54.490> you've<00:03:54.850> got<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.420> put<00:03:55.990> it<00:03:56.110> together

00:03:58.720 --> 00:03:58.730 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.020 

and<00:03:59.209> slide<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.840> in<00:04:00.140> there<00:04:00.430> almost<00:04:01.430> at<00:04:01.760> the<00:04:01.819> same

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
and slide it in there almost at the same

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.399 
and slide it in there almost at the same
time<00:04:02.269> because<00:04:02.569> you<00:04:02.690> don't<00:04:02.930> have<00:04:02.989> a<00:04:03.110> lot<00:04:03.379> of

00:04:03.399 --> 00:04:03.409 
time because you don't have a lot of

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.620 
time because you don't have a lot of
leeway<00:04:03.769> here

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
leeway here

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.059 
leeway here
I'm<00:04:06.630> going<00:04:06.780> to<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:06.989> this<00:04:07.110> as<00:04:07.260> best<00:04:07.440> I<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.709> for
