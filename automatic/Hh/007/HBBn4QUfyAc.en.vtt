00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
opportunities so we really designed it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.130 
opportunities so we really designed it
from<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.519> bottom<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.779> brought<00:00:30.960> over

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
from the bottom up and we brought over

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.410 
from the bottom up and we brought over
all<00:00:31.380> of<00:00:31.560> that<00:00:31.740> poor<00:00:32.070> creativity<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.000> score

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
all of that poor creativity that score

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
procedural animation so it will come to

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.459

singular character in spore hero you do

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.590 
singular character in spore hero you do
meet<00:02:01.890> up<00:02:02.010> with<00:02:02.160> that<00:02:02.340> but<00:02:02.580> it's<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:02.910> very<00:02:02.940> you

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
meet up with that but it's a very you

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.120 
meet up with that but it's a very you
know<00:02:03.630> you<00:02:03.750> just<00:02:03.990> set<00:02:04.230> back<00:02:04.440> a<00:02:04.470> little<00:02:04.740> bit<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
know you just set back a little bit to

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.860 
know you just set back a little bit to
your<00:02:05.250> last<00:02:05.460> match<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:06.030> your<00:02:06.090> last<00:02:06.270> evolution

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
your last match to your last evolution

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.359 
your last match to your last evolution
so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.410> get<00:02:07.500> to<00:02:07.620> move<00:02:07.770> forward<00:02:08.160> from<00:02:08.280> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
so you get to move forward from that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.310 
so you get to move forward from that
step<00:02:08.760> and<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.540> makes<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.780> forward<00:02:10.110> kind

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
step and it just makes it forward kind

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.930 
step and it just makes it forward kind
of<00:02:10.410> an<00:02:10.560> interesting<00:02:10.830> how<00:02:11.340> am<00:02:11.460> I<00:02:11.520> gonna<00:02:11.580> try<00:02:11.880> to
