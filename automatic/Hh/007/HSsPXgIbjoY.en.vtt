hey<00:00:00.750> guys<00:00:00.930> proper<00:00:01.380> English<00:00:01.620> here<00:00:01.800> and<00:00:01.979> today<00:00:02.100> I

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
hey guys proper English here and today I

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.679 
hey guys proper English here and today I
want<00:00:02.280> to<00:00:02.429> show<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.730> signal<00:00:03.240> strength

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:03.689 
want to show you a signal strength

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:05.690 
want to show you a signal strength
decoder<00:00:04.230> this<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.650> device<00:00:05.040> that<00:00:05.100> takes<00:00:05.460> a

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
decoder this is a device that takes a

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.299 
decoder this is a device that takes a
signal<00:00:06.180> strength<00:00:06.509> input<00:00:06.960> and<00:00:07.170> decodes<00:00:07.560> it<00:00:07.740> to

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
signal strength input and decodes it to

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.549 
signal strength input and decodes it to
a<00:00:08.340> corresponding<00:00:09.000> outputs<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.780> input<00:00:10.110> 12<00:00:10.349> and

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
a corresponding outputs I input 12 and

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.070 
a corresponding outputs I input 12 and
we<00:00:10.889> get<00:00:11.070> 12<00:00:11.400> as<00:00:11.610> an<00:00:11.820> output<00:00:12.150> now<00:00:12.750> you've

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
we get 12 as an output now you've

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.600 
we get 12 as an output now you've
probably<00:00:13.290> seen<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.920> couple<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.340> these<00:00:14.460> before

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
probably seen a couple of these before

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.910 
probably seen a couple of these before
and<00:00:14.849> they've<00:00:15.299> existed<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:16.230> quite<00:00:16.260> some<00:00:16.890> time

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
and they've existed for quite some time

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.340 
and they've existed for quite some time
but<00:00:17.820> I<00:00:18.029> wanted<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.390> show<00:00:18.510> you<00:00:18.690> the<00:00:18.960> one<00:00:19.109> that<00:00:19.320> I

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
but I wanted to show you the one that I

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.470 
but I wanted to show you the one that I
built<00:00:19.740> because<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:20.820> I<00:00:20.910> did<00:00:21.090> things<00:00:21.330> a

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
built because I think I did things a

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.420 
built because I think I did things a
little<00:00:21.720> bit<00:00:21.869> differently<00:00:22.260> than<00:00:22.740> other<00:00:23.039> people

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
little bit differently than other people

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.920 
little bit differently than other people
and<00:00:23.640> there's<00:00:24.090> some<00:00:24.210> cool<00:00:24.390> design<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.900> goes

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
and there's some cool design that goes

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.160 
and there's some cool design that goes
into<00:00:25.289> this<00:00:25.529> this<00:00:26.189> one<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.609> takes<00:00:26.849> two<00:00:27.390> tix<00:00:27.689> to

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
into this this one it takes two tix to

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.849 
into this this one it takes two tix to
decode<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:29.460> signal<00:00:29.820> strength<00:00:30.119> input<00:00:30.660> and<00:00:30.929> I

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
decode the signal strength input and I

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.110 
decode the signal strength input and I
think<00:00:32.040> that's<00:00:32.160> pretty<00:00:32.340> cool<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.850> way<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.969> did

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
think that's pretty cool the way I did

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.049 
think that's pretty cool the way I did
that<00:00:33.270> is<00:00:33.600> by<00:00:34.230> getting<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.100> wide<00:00:35.460> not<00:00:35.910> by

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
that is by getting this one wide not by

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.690 
that is by getting this one wide not by
using<00:00:36.270> repeaters<00:00:36.840> but<00:00:37.200> by<00:00:37.380> staggering<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.219> so

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
using repeaters but by staggering it so

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.549 
using repeaters but by staggering it so
let's<00:00:38.879> start<00:00:39.090> off<00:00:39.239> by<00:00:39.390> taking<00:00:39.600> a<00:00:39.840> look<00:00:39.870> at<00:00:40.230> how

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
let's start off by taking a look at how

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.410 
let's start off by taking a look at how
it<00:00:40.710> works<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.129> then<00:00:41.219> we<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.820> into<00:00:42.030> the

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
it works and then we can look into the

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.510 
it works and then we can look into the
design<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.110> used<00:00:43.440> all<00:00:43.649> right<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.160> how<00:00:44.460> does

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
design that I used all right so how does

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.729 
design that I used all right so how does
this<00:00:44.850> thing<00:00:44.910> work<00:00:45.149> well<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.079> we<00:00:46.260> take<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.469> look

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
this thing work well if we take a look

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.979 
this thing work well if we take a look
at<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.129> output<00:00:47.520> that's<00:00:47.760> on<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.270> can<00:00:48.420> see<00:00:48.629> that

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
at the output that's on we can see that

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.500 
at the output that's on we can see that
the<00:00:49.050> top<00:00:49.559> input<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.070> on<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:50.670> bottom<00:00:51.090> input

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
the top input is on and the bottom input

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.900 
the top input is on and the bottom input
is<00:00:51.690> off<00:00:51.870> that's<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.680> only<00:00:53.100> situation<00:00:53.340> in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
is off that's the only situation in

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.299 
is off that's the only situation in
which<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.480> output<00:00:54.660> is<00:00:55.050> going<00:00:55.350> to<00:00:55.469> be<00:00:55.559> on<00:00:55.710> but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
which the output is going to be on but

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.910 
which the output is going to be on but
why<00:00:56.460> is<00:00:56.520> that<00:00:56.670> well<00:00:57.480> we<00:00:57.780> need<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.170> top<00:00:58.440> input

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
why is that well we need the top input

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.160 
why is that well we need the top input
to<00:00:59.070> be<00:00:59.100> on<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.030> we<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.270> power<00:01:00.510> this<00:01:00.840> torch

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
to be on so that we can power this torch

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.349 
to be on so that we can power this torch
and<00:01:01.379> so<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:02.039> it<00:01:02.160> doesn't<00:01:02.399> power<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:03.000> output

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
and so that it doesn't power the output

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.780 
and so that it doesn't power the output
torch<00:01:03.629> we<00:01:04.320> need<00:01:04.500> at<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.830> bottom<00:01:05.280> input<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.760> be

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
torch we need at the bottom input to be

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
torch we need at the bottom input to be
off<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.540> that<00:01:06.840> this<00:01:07.260> repeater<00:01:07.619> does<00:01:07.890> not<00:01:08.100> get

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
off so that this repeater does not get

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.300 
off so that this repeater does not get
powered<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.140> that<00:01:10.290> it<00:01:10.500> can<00:01:10.799> power<00:01:11.040> our

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
powered and so that it can power our

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.210 
powered and so that it can power our
output<00:01:11.880> torch<00:01:12.210> but<00:01:12.840> how<00:01:13.049> do<00:01:13.110> we<00:01:13.320> set<00:01:13.590> up<00:01:13.770> these

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
output torch but how do we set up these

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.690 
output torch but how do we set up these
two<00:01:14.549> inputs<00:01:15.060> well<00:01:15.810> if<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.200> come<00:01:16.409> over<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:17.280> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
two inputs well if we come over to the

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
two inputs well if we come over to the
input<00:01:17.909> for<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> decoder<00:01:18.900> we<00:01:19.170> can<00:01:19.290> see<00:01:19.530> that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
input for the decoder we can see that

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.270 
input for the decoder we can see that
the<00:01:19.830> top<00:01:20.100> line<00:01:20.430> goes<00:01:21.150> straight<00:01:21.780> across<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.380> it

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the top line goes straight across and it

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.520 
the top line goes straight across and it
goes<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.850> full<00:01:24.180> length<00:01:24.509> of<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> signal

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
goes the full length of the signal

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.100 
goes the full length of the signal
strength<00:01:25.770> if<00:01:26.070> we<00:01:26.909> take<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.119> look<00:01:27.330> at<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.689> bottom

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
strength if we take a look at the bottom

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.620 
strength if we take a look at the bottom
line<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.560> moves<00:01:28.890> over<00:01:29.070> one<00:01:29.640> before<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.299> starts

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
line it moves over one before it starts

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.410 
line it moves over one before it starts
going<00:01:30.990> across<00:01:31.409> that<00:01:32.280> means<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.880> going<00:01:33.090> to

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
going across that means it's going to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.230 
going across that means it's going to
travel<00:01:33.689> a<00:01:33.960> distance<00:01:33.990> one<00:01:34.860> less<00:01:35.490> than<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.210> full

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
travel a distance one less than the full

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050 
travel a distance one less than the full
signal<00:01:36.780> strength<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.290> that<00:01:38.250> sets<00:01:38.700> up<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
signal strength and that sets up a

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.190 
signal strength and that sets up a
situation<00:01:39.270> where<00:01:40.170> this<00:01:41.159> guy<00:01:41.400> is<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:42.200> this

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
situation where this guy is on this

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.770 
situation where this guy is on this
guy's<00:01:43.409> off<00:01:43.619> and<00:01:43.920> so<00:01:44.579> we<00:01:44.909> can<00:01:45.090> decode<00:01:45.450> our

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
guy's off and so we can decode our

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.399 
guy's off and so we can decode our
signal<00:01:46.170> strength<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.680> get<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.640> output<00:01:47.899> so<00:01:48.899> now

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
signal strength and get an output so now

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.289 
signal strength and get an output so now
that<00:01:49.439> we've<00:01:49.770> taken<00:01:49.979> a<00:01:50.189> look<00:01:50.220> at<00:01:50.549> how<00:01:51.030> this

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
that we've taken a look at how this

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.450 
that we've taken a look at how this
thing<00:01:51.570> works<00:01:51.600> let's<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.770> look<00:01:53.040> at<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
thing works let's take a look at the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.480 
thing works let's take a look at the
design<00:01:53.880> that<00:01:54.299> goes<00:01:54.329> into<00:01:54.780> making<00:01:55.229> this<00:01:55.950> one

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
design that goes into making this one

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.120 
design that goes into making this one
wide<00:01:56.729> stackable<00:01:57.659> but<00:01:58.290> still<00:01:58.590> pretty<00:01:58.740> fast

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
wide stackable but still pretty fast

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.340 
wide stackable but still pretty fast
I've<00:01:59.549> pulled<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.329> slice<00:02:00.659> of<00:02:00.689> this<00:02:00.990> decoder

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
I've pulled out a slice of this decoder

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.440 
I've pulled out a slice of this decoder
so<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:01.740> we<00:02:01.829> can<00:02:01.950> see<00:02:02.189> how<00:02:02.340> it<00:02:02.369> stacks<00:02:02.759> up<00:02:02.969> it's

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
so that we can see how it stacks up it's

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.539 
so that we can see how it stacks up it's
one<00:02:03.659> wide<00:02:03.840> stackable<00:02:04.409> but<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:05.009> special

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
one wide stackable but it's a special

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.340 
one wide stackable but it's a special
kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.909> one<00:02:06.119> white<00:02:06.270> stackable<00:02:06.899> because

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
kind of one white stackable because

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.219 
kind of one white stackable because
we're<00:02:07.950> not<00:02:08.220> relying<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:09.000> repeaters<00:02:09.690> to<00:02:10.110> get

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
we're not relying on repeaters to get

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.830 
we're not relying on repeaters to get
that<00:02:10.410> stack<00:02:10.709> ability<00:02:11.220> right<00:02:11.910> so<00:02:12.209> we've<00:02:12.660> got

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
that stack ability right so we've got

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
that stack ability right so we've got
wire<00:02:13.080> in<00:02:13.319> here<00:02:13.560> too

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
wire in here too

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.550 
wire in here too
get<00:02:14.040> faster<00:02:14.610> instead<00:02:15.510> of<00:02:15.540> using<00:02:16.080> repeaters

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
get faster instead of using repeaters

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.380 
get faster instead of using repeaters
which<00:02:16.830> would<00:02:16.980> add<00:02:17.100> an<00:02:17.220> extra<00:02:17.490> tick<00:02:17.790> or<00:02:17.970> two<00:02:18.180> and

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
which would add an extra tick or two and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.590 
which would add an extra tick or two and
it<00:02:19.350> ends<00:02:19.680> up<00:02:19.830> doing<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.670> exact<00:02:21.120> same<00:02:21.210> thing

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:21.600 
it ends up doing the exact same thing

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.110 
it ends up doing the exact same thing
but<00:02:22.170> faster<00:02:22.680> so<00:02:23.280> that's<00:02:23.430> pretty<00:02:23.640> cool<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
but faster so that's pretty cool and

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.850 
but faster so that's pretty cool and
this<00:02:24.420> is<00:02:24.570> a<00:02:24.600> concept<00:02:25.080> that<00:02:25.200> I'm<00:02:25.620> probably

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
this is a concept that I'm probably

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.790 
this is a concept that I'm probably
going<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.370> playing<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:27.000> in<00:02:27.210> terms<00:02:27.840> of<00:02:28.050> one

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
going to be playing with in terms of one

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.580 
going to be playing with in terms of one
wide<00:02:29.070> stackable<00:02:29.850> designs<00:02:30.270> in<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:31.050> future<00:02:31.440> I

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:31.590 
wide stackable designs in the future I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.620 
wide stackable designs in the future I
mean<00:02:32.010> it's<00:02:32.130> not<00:02:32.250> going<00:02:32.490> to<00:02:32.670> be<00:02:32.790> applicable<00:02:33.210> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
mean it's not going to be applicable to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.800 
mean it's not going to be applicable to
everything<00:02:34.320> because<00:02:35.120> sometimes<00:02:36.120> wiring<00:02:36.600> can

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
everything because sometimes wiring can

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.630 
everything because sometimes wiring can
get<00:02:36.990> pretty<00:02:37.200> tricky<00:02:37.560> this<00:02:38.040> is<00:02:38.220> a<00:02:38.250> situation

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
get pretty tricky this is a situation

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.620 
get pretty tricky this is a situation
where<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:40.170> wiring<00:02:40.620> is<00:02:40.770> very<00:02:41.730> simple<00:02:42.360> in<00:02:42.570> terms

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
where the wiring is very simple in terms

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.430 
where the wiring is very simple in terms
of<00:02:43.440> the<00:02:44.160> overall<00:02:44.190> logic<00:02:45.120> gates<00:02:45.330> so<00:02:45.600> I<00:02:45.810> can<00:02:46.230> pull

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
of the overall logic gates so I can pull

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.830 
of the overall logic gates so I can pull
something<00:02:46.680> off<00:02:46.920> where<00:02:47.580> we<00:02:48.060> don't<00:02:48.450> need<00:02:48.720> the

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
something off where we don't need the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.440 
something off where we don't need the
extra<00:02:48.870> repeaters<00:02:49.530> but<00:02:49.800> other<00:02:50.190> times<00:02:50.580> there's

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
extra repeaters but other times there's

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.660 
extra repeaters but other times there's
really<00:02:51.570> nothing<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.959> can<00:02:52.170> do<00:02:52.670> that's

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:53.670 
really nothing you can do that's

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.040 
really nothing you can do that's
everything<00:02:54.090> I<00:02:54.150> wanted<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.480> show<00:02:54.660> you<00:02:54.720> today<00:02:54.900> so

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
everything I wanted to show you today so

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.900 
everything I wanted to show you today so
I<00:02:55.260> hope<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.770> enjoyed<00:02:56.070> this<00:02:56.250> thanks<00:02:56.760> for

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I hope you enjoyed this thanks for

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.709 
I hope you enjoyed this thanks for
watching<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.420> I'll<00:02:57.630> see<00:02:57.660> you<00:02:57.989> guys<00:02:58.020> next<00:02:58.440> time
