00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
computer with an additional monitor TV

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.009 
computer with an additional monitor TV
or<00:00:22.980> projector<00:00:23.250> so<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.300> a<00:00:24.330> very<00:00:24.510> small<00:00:24.600> device

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
or projector so it's a very small device

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.900 
or projector so it's a very small device
as<00:00:25.260> you<00:00:25.320> can<00:00:25.680> see<00:00:25.830> here<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.250> basically<00:00:26.460> fits<00:00:26.820> on

as you can see here it basically fits on

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.550 
as you can see here it basically fits on
the<00:00:27.000> power<00:00:27.210> in<00:00:27.359> my<00:00:27.449> hand<00:00:27.660> it's<00:00:27.869> probably<00:00:28.260> a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
the power in my hand it's probably a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.550 
the power in my hand it's probably a
little<00:00:29.160> bit<00:00:29.250> smaller<00:00:29.550> than<00:00:29.699> an<00:00:29.880> Apple<00:00:30.300> TV<00:00:30.560> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
little bit smaller than an Apple TV so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.100 
little bit smaller than an Apple TV so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
driver and you also get a USB cable now

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.660
