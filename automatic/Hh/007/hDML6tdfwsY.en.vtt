00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.920
 hey martin here in this video 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.799
 I want you a few times just a few 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.219
 give tips on what you were at the blood test 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:14.219
 In any case, you should look for ours 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:18.359
 and according to my experience so 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.430
 In principle, depending on the health insurance by 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.720
 normal case is you every two years 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:28.070
 a blood test has big blood picture and has in the 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.920
 principle already all essentials 3 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:34.079
 now you can almost book yes 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.579
 Add book as much as you book 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.350
 do you want a mineral substance 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.180
 make profiles you can do a complete 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.610
 make amino acid profile you can do one 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.020
 heavy metal investigation do what 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.340
 you can again to all sorts 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.510
 things on all sorts of things 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.280
 to be examined 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.690
 in my opinion, for example 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.800
 an amino acid profile examination 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.610
 wasted money 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.649
 but that only a personal opinion yes 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:59.129
 if you have a big blood picture now 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:01.469
 yes, then I have really easy 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.789
 big difference experienced so bear 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.060
 which as big differences but certain 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.110
 Differences between certain doctors yes 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.159
 is obviously clear in 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.200
 different people and not everyone 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:13.020
 turns so clever that is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.420
 Look, that your doctor really looks there 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.790
 can bring out a lot for you so yes 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.350
 have the space in the sense 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.330
 that you can then settle on the 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.159
 What kind of cash on what 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.210
 can make a cash benefit so i have 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.340
 now here, for example , one time 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.560
 mineral profile profile available 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.770
 Can you get a sodium potassium calcium 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.610
 magnesium copper iron zinc phosphate 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.950
 lithium stuffs stuff like that 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:44.520
 to get a check up 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.500
 sometimes very interesting what I was 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.710
 I think is particularly important at 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.509
 a blood test so I'm the first 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:55.140
 whole thyroid history the 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:57.810
 should participate in the standard blood test 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.450
 its then of course I say 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.390
 the 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:07.539
 this hba1c so these diabetics 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:11.060
 Indicator value I find interesting 

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.840
 triglyceride cholesterol such things 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.840
 are also very interesting 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.970
 and now comes the extra stuff 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.050
 which I would value 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:28.010
 Now what will that be ? 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.769
 iron iron is in my opinion if 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.569
 her really a healthy vegan hey cup 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.860
 history makes no problem so that 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.870
 In any case, the experience we have 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.459
 have made 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:40.750
 At pudding vegans see the whole thing 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.750
 certainly different 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.360
 Now let's take a look at the things 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.370
 you would almost have to book that is 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.049
 She is going to the doctor now 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.299
 agreed for a blood sample and 

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:56.000
 says I need that and that 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:01.190
 and that would be on one side now 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.120
 the vitamin d3 and in principle is 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:07.209
 vitamin d is a hormone in principle 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.130
 a hormone and it is a fat-soluble 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:13.160
 it was not water-soluble 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:18.049
 that means also at this point 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:23.079
 wink to the whole fans of extreme 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:26.060
 high dosages for the vitamin d 

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.250
 pay attention to people I'm not a fan of 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.260
 these high dosages because it is in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.180
 principle a hormone and it is 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.620
 fat-soluble with water-soluble 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.680
 stories comes the body much better 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.620
 clear at overdose he can 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.910
 maybe lead out 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.130
 Vitamin D is just a critical one 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:46.549
 thing and there we have to pay attention 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:49.130
 the second point is for me the 

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:52.310
 vitamin b12 that means these things 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.030
 you should book and the cost 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:59.540
 you vitamin d costs about 30 euros 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:01.639
 and at vitamin b12 if you are now 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.470
 almost the program makes or the package 

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.690
 do what we recommend to you now if 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.239
 are say another 30 to 60 euros 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:11.440
 again at the end of 60 to 100 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:14.590
 but euro is here all a two years 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:17.380
 I think you should like that in the 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.610
 all is going to be around at b12 he is too 

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:22.000
 you let that examine 

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:23.860
 then you can once the the serum 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.700
 value determines what's in the blood 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:29.410
 is and as we also recommend the mms sms 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.600
 be that this methylonic acid 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.760
 because only the value of the blood 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.440
 Present does not say anything about it 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.140
 with both values you have a lot 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.280
 very good indicator and it was with us 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.990
 so now I have just that 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.540
 Values ​​are that the b12 value in 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.960
 serum was low and alonso with him 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.760
 value high that has with our name 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:51.340
 low as twelve games and low 

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.540
 Twelve play serum is clearly speaking 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.890
 he too, but now it is so that 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.200
 neither of us this result 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:02.260
 has surprised and I think that will 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.870
 even with someone who lives exactly like that or 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:06.670
 at a vegan after five or white 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.590
 I do not look different for how many years 

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:10.540
 Of course it's clear because if you are 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:13.360
 now eat normally again will will 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:16.720
 you also slip into the normal field but 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:19.330
 they are low values and I'll say it 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:22.990
 also in this place it insistently 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:26.200
 is our opinion b12 should you 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:29.169
 you will simply be supplemented 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.560
 Also my recommendation below purely 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.060
 or in principle you are then 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:35.500
 even by yes I have it 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.840
 in between, again briefly mentioned 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:39.040
 all those thyroid glands the 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.950
 can namely a lot of problems 

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:44.560
 cause 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.410
 and you should not do it that way 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.870
 smoothly pass over easily 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.550
 That means that I would be mine 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:54.120
 have an eye on it and otherwise 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:55.810
 vitamin d and vitamin b12 

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.330
 then I do not want to continue 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:01.750
 squabble hopes that has you again 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:04.540
 what brought such a mineral profile 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.150
 but amino acid profile heavy metal 

00:06:04.540 --> 00:06:09.250
 I would not make history except 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:11.350
 I may have some old ones 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.910
 tooth yet still movie had with 

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:14.410
 That's what most of our young people do 

00:06:12.910 --> 00:06:16.330
 no longer concerned or I have 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:18.610
 really massive problems where to say 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:20.800
 okay, I just have to take a step 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.550
 go ahead and see if there somehow 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.560
 the worm in it 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.300
 it is yes if you say hey that is 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.599
 somehow 

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.819
 which probably is not something 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:33.090
 no standard story would be then 

00:06:29.819 --> 00:06:35.909
 I consider these stories in consideration 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:38.819
 I thank you for watching people until 

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:40.949
 That's what makes it good if you still have it 

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:43.520
 have questions let us know it writes 

00:06:40.949 --> 00:06:43.520
 down us
