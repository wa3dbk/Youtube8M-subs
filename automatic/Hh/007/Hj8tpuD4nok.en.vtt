the normal guys on nightmare difficulty

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.690 
the normal guys on nightmare difficulty
I<00:03:18.000> think<00:03:18.269> it<00:03:18.360> takes<00:03:18.480> three<00:03:18.870> on<00:03:19.049> hard<00:03:19.610> are<00:03:20.610> they

I think it takes three on hard are they

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.979 
I think it takes three on hard are they
regenerating<00:03:21.510> their<00:03:21.660> shadows<00:03:22.519> no<00:03:23.690> not<00:03:24.690> sure

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
regenerating their shadows no not sure

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:26.060 
regenerating their shadows no not sure
