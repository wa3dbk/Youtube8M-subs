00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.629
 We are going to use 4 tablespoons of 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.869

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.390

 water the mouth is that 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:07.670
 I like this recipe, I like it above all 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.320
 the roll of the chaya we are going to put here 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:16.479
 in this pan a little bit 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:20.100
 today hey hey hey hey true let's put 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:23.250
 in this pot a little olive oil 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.250
 and we are going to put our 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.250
 scallions 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.450
 and the garlic that will be minced 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:39.860
 what is all this all about 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.450
 how rich a beating 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.610
 so that it is golden is super good 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.070
 let's also start the white sauce 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:52.759
 here the pan has to be just 10 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.759
 and I'm going to add the butter 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.010
 to melt 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:04.619
 I think the butter pity that a 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.619
 green so much really saturated fats 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.519
 let's add the flour and let's 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.519
 let it last a little 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.140
 you know that this can be done 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.140
 a pump with flour and hot oil 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.590
 well let's let me achieve a little 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:40.629
 now let's check our onions to 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:44.079
 We are going to add the size that 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:46.180
 has a lot of fiber this 

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.250
 will help a lot too for diego 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.190
 entry for digestion to follow 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:56.069
 eliminate toxins from the body and apart 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.069
 know that you have to let it last well 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:07.940
 these these good since it 's good 

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:11.300
 in the flour with the butter we are going to 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.400
 add milk 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.890
 in this case if you want to add a little 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.440
 of coconut milk 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.750
 it would also be good huh 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.590
 let's also add the chicken that already 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:27.830
 is served and crumbled we are going to 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.450
 also add the shrimp 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.870
 seafood of your preference to the best 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.450
 they want to add something else , let's go 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:38.090
 to add the soy sauce until now 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:41.860
 We have not added salt then as 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:46.260
 because we made soy sauce 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.260
 let's put some cream 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:56.300
 I like the spatulas, well, let's go 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.300
 add size 

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:01.470
 make a kind of as an infusion 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:11.790
 go now what we are going to do is that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:14.280
 let's take some tortillas 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:16.819
 and we are going to put them here to heat a 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.819
 bit 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:23.730
 in our satin let's take a plate 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.910
 to start doing as 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.200
 I'm such a nice little guy that if 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.690
 feel the tortillas you are going to 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.050
 make the flour tortillas when 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.610
 throw the tortillas you put it in a 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:37.680
 side and when turning it over 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.750
 I recommend that you grab a wet cloth and 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.480
 with the wet cloth hit a little 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.430
 so the tortilla to inflate if they inflate 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:45.350
 Then you take them out and cut the 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.660
 tortilla in half 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:52.260
 cosalÃ¡ bremen 2 and that's where we're going to 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.030
 insert the filling otherwise if 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.360
 they are buying them well then 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:59.160
 they are going to take their tortilla and they are going to make 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.730
 this trick they are going to put a layer of 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.730
 tortilla 

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:08.880
 and they're going to put the seafood 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.580
 being rich does not believe that they are seafood 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:12.710
 they are not 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.509
 to me if they ask me what I prefer if 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:15.939
 seafood meat 

00:05:14.509 --> 00:05:19.310
 with respect to cholesterol 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:21.080
 definitely seafood because the fat 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.760
 saturated with seafood is totally 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.230
 different 

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.720
 no no no it 's finally fed algae 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.409
 then cholesterol is like less 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.499
 harmful 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:37.190
 let's put another tortilla on top let 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:41.470
 to see a warmth here 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.470
 also how bad this is boiling 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.240
 and we're going to put a little bit more of 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:52.860
 seafood to them in how we see 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.660
 as a gesture 

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:58.830
 with a little habanero chile 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.830
 it would be super good 

00:06:04.409 --> 00:06:12.630
 We were going to put another pancake 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.810
 This is going to leave you with sauce 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:17.940
 We put the gratin cheese and they are already 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:21.350
 ready to eat something delicious let's go 

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:21.350
 a cut back we do not go
