for like 35 k or some like that so right

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.540 
for like 35 k or some like that so right
that's<00:02:30.990> another<00:02:31.200> huge<00:02:31.440> profit<00:02:31.890> it's<00:02:32.460> all

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:32.550 
that's another huge profit it's all

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.220 
that's another huge profit it's all
about<00:02:32.750> being<00:02:33.750> quicker<00:02:34.020> than<00:02:34.170> others

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
about being quicker than others

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.100 
about being quicker than others
obviously<00:02:35.010> this<00:02:35.160> method<00:02:35.690> once<00:02:36.690> again<00:02:36.810> you<00:02:37.020> go

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
obviously this method once again you go

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.380 
obviously this method once again you go
to<00:02:37.170> the<00:02:37.320> four<00:02:37.560> hour<00:02:37.770> mark<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:38.340> you<00:02:38.970> just<00:02:39.150> watch

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
to the four hour mark and you just watch

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.300 
to the four hour mark and you just watch
this<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:40.140> wait<00:02:40.380> for<00:02:40.440> someone<00:02:40.770> to<00:02:40.860> come<00:02:40.950> down

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
this and wait for someone to come down

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.900 
this and wait for someone to come down
you<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.090> even<00:02:42.180> get<00:02:42.600> rid<00:02:42.720> of<00:02:42.810> us<00:02:43.220> what's<00:02:44.220> called

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:49.310 

let's<00:02:47.910> like<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.750> can<00:02:48.870> even<00:02:49.050> get<00:02:49.170> rid<00:02:49.260> of

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320
