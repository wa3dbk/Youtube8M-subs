00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.180 

okay<00:00:12.059> so<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.750> operation<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.650> growing<00:00:14.070> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
okay so the operation is growing a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.240 
okay so the operation is growing a
little<00:00:14.309> and<00:00:14.780> we're<00:00:15.780> now<00:00:16.049> making<00:00:16.290> a<00:00:16.619> second<00:00:17.010> bin

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
little and we're now making a second bin

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.190 
little and we're now making a second bin
as<00:00:17.550> you<00:00:18.150> can<00:00:18.300> see<00:00:18.539> is<00:00:18.689> a<00:00:18.720> little<00:00:18.810> bit<00:00:18.990> of<00:00:19.110> a

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:19.200 
as you can see is a little bit of a

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:20.510 
as you can see is a little bit of a
difference<00:00:19.680> between<00:00:20.009> the<00:00:20.070> person<00:00:20.220> on<00:00:20.460> the

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
difference between the person on the

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.940 
difference between the person on the
second<00:00:20.820> one<00:00:21.380> since<00:00:22.380> I'm<00:00:22.500> just<00:00:22.680> going<00:00:22.800> to<00:00:22.860> be

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:22.950 
second one since I'm just going to be

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.620 
second one since I'm just going to be
using<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.279> for<00:00:23.490> growing<00:00:23.669> larvae<00:00:24.150> I<00:00:24.330> don't

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
using these for growing larvae I don't

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.200 
using these for growing larvae I don't
necessarily<00:00:24.810> need<00:00:26.210> the<00:00:27.289> screen<00:00:28.289> section

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
necessarily need the screen section

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.840 
necessarily need the screen section
although<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.859> have<00:00:31.859> I'm<00:00:32.189> getting<00:00:32.460> some<00:00:32.640> flies

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
although I have I'm getting some flies

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.460 
although I have I'm getting some flies
coming<00:00:33.269> in<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.750> laying<00:00:33.930> some<00:00:34.170> eggs

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:36.470 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.290 

this<00:00:37.470> bin<00:00:37.680> has<00:00:37.830> worked<00:00:38.010> really<00:00:38.190> well<00:00:41.300> except

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
this bin has worked really well except

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.340 
this bin has worked really well except
for<00:00:42.480> one<00:00:43.140> design<00:00:43.829> flaw<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.700> this<00:00:45.390> side<00:00:45.629> I<00:00:45.660> had

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
for one design flaw on this side I had

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.560 
for one design flaw on this side I had
an<00:00:46.469> opening<00:00:47.480> for<00:00:48.480> a<00:00:48.540> door<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.530> clean<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.219> out

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
an opening for a door to clean it out

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.479 
an opening for a door to clean it out
well<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.829> as<00:00:52.920> easily<00:00:53.100> cleaning

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
well I think just as easily cleaning

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.799 
well I think just as easily cleaning
from<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> pop<00:00:53.850> but<00:00:54.120> what's<00:00:54.270> happening<00:00:54.629> here

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
from the pop but what's happening here

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.830 
from the pop but what's happening here
is<00:00:55.469> these<00:00:55.710> guys<00:00:55.920> are<00:00:55.980> building<00:00:56.579> up<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
is these guys are building up on the

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.389 
is these guys are building up on the
corner<00:00:58.170> and<00:00:58.320> they<00:00:58.410> actually<00:00:58.770> make<00:00:59.070> it<00:00:59.219> all<00:00:59.370> the

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
corner and they actually make it all the

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.260 
corner and they actually make it all the
way<00:00:59.579> to<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.850> top<00:01:00.120> and<00:01:00.360> make<00:01:00.570> it<00:01:00.690> out<00:01:02.270> unlike

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
way to the top and make it out unlike

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.460 
way to the top and make it out unlike
the<00:01:03.449> other<00:01:03.600> side<00:01:03.809> where<00:01:03.960> they<00:01:04.050> got<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.289> ramp

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
the other side where they got the ramp

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.570 
the other side where they got the ramp
and<00:01:04.649> they<00:01:04.739> land<00:01:04.949> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.190> tote<00:01:06.440> so<00:01:07.580> design

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
and they land in the tote so design

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
and they land in the tote so design
improvement<00:01:09.180> number<00:01:09.450> one<00:01:09.660> well<00:01:10.590> number<00:01:11.039> one

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
improvement number one well number one

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.100 
improvement number one well number one
is<00:01:11.460> changing<00:01:11.789> the<00:01:11.880> lid<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.750> just<00:01:12.930> made<00:01:13.080> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
is changing the lid we just made a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.889 
is changing the lid we just made a
simple<00:01:13.759> flip<00:01:14.759> up<00:01:14.910> lid<00:01:15.149> instead<00:01:15.660> of<00:01:15.780> an

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
simple flip up lid instead of an

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:19.190 
simple flip up lid instead of an
extravagant<00:01:16.830> roof<00:01:17.069> system<00:01:17.610> and<00:01:18.050> that<00:01:19.050> made<00:01:19.170> it

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
extravagant roof system and that made it

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.719 
extravagant roof system and that made it
a<00:01:19.289> whole<00:01:19.440> lot<00:01:19.470> easier<00:01:19.800> to<00:01:19.890> make<00:01:20.069> and<00:01:20.280> then

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
a whole lot easier to make and then

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.520 
a whole lot easier to make and then
second<00:01:21.149> we<00:01:21.330> made<00:01:21.509> two<00:01:21.720> ramps<00:01:21.959> one<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.410> each

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
second we made two ramps one on each

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.800 
second we made two ramps one on each
side<00:01:22.800> okay<00:01:25.880> we<00:01:26.880> haven't<00:01:27.030> loaded<00:01:27.270> anything<00:01:27.690> in

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
side okay we haven't loaded anything in

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660 
side okay we haven't loaded anything in
here<00:01:27.990> yet<00:01:28.229> we've<00:01:28.380> put<00:01:28.770> some<00:01:28.890> damp<00:01:29.099> sawdust<00:01:29.550> on

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
here yet we've put some damp sawdust on

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.630 
here yet we've put some damp sawdust on
the<00:01:29.759> bottom<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.780> cover<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.140> drain<00:01:31.349> holes

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the bottom to cover the drain holes

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
the bottom to cover the drain holes
we've<00:01:32.640> seem<00:01:32.789> to<00:01:32.910> work<00:01:33.060> pretty<00:01:33.090> good<00:01:33.330> on<00:01:33.569> the

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
we've seem to work pretty good on the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:39.440 
we've seem to work pretty good on the
other<00:01:33.810> one<00:01:35.090> yeah<00:01:36.090> open<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.569> lid<00:01:36.750> and<00:01:38.450> you've

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
other one yeah open the lid and you've

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:45.109 
other one yeah open the lid and you've
got<00:01:39.690> a<00:01:39.720> fly<00:01:40.110> already<00:01:40.590> laying<00:01:41.489> some<00:01:41.729> eggs<00:01:44.119> but

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
got a fly already laying some eggs but

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.910 
got a fly already laying some eggs but
also<00:01:47.360> how<00:01:48.360> long<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:48.810> when<00:01:49.470> I<00:01:49.500> emptied<00:01:49.830> out

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
also how long with when I emptied out

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.740 
also how long with when I emptied out
the<00:01:50.099> barrel<00:01:50.489> what<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.759> did<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:51.179> I<00:01:51.270> put<00:01:51.300> some<00:01:51.599> more

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
the barrel what I did is I put some more

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.279 
the barrel what I did is I put some more
food<00:01:51.959> in<00:01:52.170> there<00:01:52.380> and<00:01:53.660> not<00:01:54.660> meaning<00:01:54.929> to<00:01:54.959> find<00:01:55.229> a

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
food in there and not meaning to find a

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:59.889 
food in there and not meaning to find a
chicken<00:01:55.500> in<00:01:55.709> there<00:01:55.860> but<00:01:57.560> hang<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.679> a<00:01:58.739> second

00:01:59.889 --> 00:01:59.899 
chicken in there but hang on a second

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.830 
chicken in there but hang on a second
and<00:02:00.899> I've<00:02:01.080> got<00:02:01.319> all<00:02:01.530> ages<00:02:02.069> of<00:02:02.340> new<00:02:03.209> larvae<00:02:03.660> back

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
and I've got all ages of new larvae back

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.969 
and I've got all ages of new larvae back
in<00:02:04.020> this<00:02:04.110> barrel<00:02:04.410> so<00:02:04.530> what<00:02:04.649> I'm<00:02:04.739> gonna<00:02:04.830> do

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
in this barrel so what I'm gonna do

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.999 
in this barrel so what I'm gonna do
today<00:02:05.099> is<00:02:05.429> I'm<00:02:06.000> gonna<00:02:06.379> empty<00:02:07.379> this<00:02:07.619> barrel

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
today is I'm gonna empty this barrel

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.740 
today is I'm gonna empty this barrel
into<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.310> new<00:02:08.429> bin<00:02:08.700> there's<00:02:09.209> probably<00:02:09.629> more

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
into the new bin there's probably more

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.900 
into the new bin there's probably more
larvae<00:02:10.050> in<00:02:10.259> here<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.709> than<00:02:11.459> there<00:02:11.640> was<00:02:11.730> the

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
larvae in here now than there was the

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:18.770 
larvae in here now than there was the
first<00:02:12.060> time<00:02:12.270> we

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:05:07.420 

time

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:07.430 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.480 

so<00:05:08.430> what<00:05:08.580> we<00:05:08.700> had<00:05:08.850> in<00:05:09.000> here<00:05:09.120> was<00:05:09.300> old<00:05:09.480> grain<00:05:10.490> and

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
so what we had in here was old grain and

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.250 
so what we had in here was old grain and
some<00:05:11.760> produce<00:05:11.970> and<00:05:13.910> there<00:05:14.910> is<00:05:15.090> still<00:05:15.570> a<00:05:18.260> bunch

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
some produce and there is still a bunch

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.140 
some produce and there is still a bunch
of<00:05:19.380> larvae<00:05:19.740> in<00:05:19.800> here<00:05:19.980> so<00:05:20.190> I<00:05:20.220> will<00:05:20.640> start

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:21.150 
of larvae in here so I will start

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:22.159 
of larvae in here so I will start
feeding<00:05:21.360> this<00:05:21.630> again

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
feeding this again

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.090 
feeding this again
and<00:05:23.160> there's<00:05:23.340> also<00:05:23.460> eggs<00:05:23.790> along<00:05:24.060> the<00:05:24.240> side<00:05:25.100> so

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
and there's also eggs along the side so

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.380 
and there's also eggs along the side so
we'll<00:05:26.190> probably<00:05:26.400> get<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.640> whole<00:05:26.790> nother<00:05:26.940> colony

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:27.390 
we'll probably get a whole nother colony

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.670 
we'll probably get a whole nother colony
here<00:05:27.780> in<00:05:27.930> a<00:05:28.020> week<00:05:28.260> or<00:05:28.380> so<00:05:29.270> and<00:05:30.270> then<00:05:30.720> I<00:05:30.990> don't

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
here in a week or so and then I don't

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.440 
here in a week or so and then I don't
know<00:05:31.830> if<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.070> does<00:05:32.220> any<00:05:32.430> damage<00:05:32.520> if<00:05:33.180> anyone

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
know if it does any damage if anyone

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:37.700 
know if it does any damage if anyone
knows<00:05:33.660> let<00:05:34.110> me<00:05:34.200> know<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:35.610> turn<00:05:36.450> this<00:05:36.810> beans<00:05:37.590> I

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
knows let me know to turn this beans I

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.870 
knows let me know to turn this beans I
took<00:05:37.890> it<00:05:37.980> out<00:05:38.070> of<00:05:38.160> the<00:05:38.220> barrel<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.580> put<00:05:38.730> it<00:05:38.790> in

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:38.880 
took it out of the barrel and put it in

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.950 
took it out of the barrel and put it in
here<00:05:39.090> got<00:05:39.960> pretty<00:05:40.169> well<00:05:40.320> turned<00:05:41.960> most

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
here got pretty well turned most

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.600 
here got pretty well turned most
everybody's<00:05:43.530> crawl<00:05:43.770> down<00:05:43.950> but<00:05:44.220> there<00:05:44.370> is

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
everybody's crawl down but there is

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.020 
everybody's crawl down but there is
quite<00:05:44.880> a<00:05:44.910> few<00:05:45.000> and<00:05:45.540> they're<00:05:45.870> all<00:05:45.990> ages<00:05:46.380> even

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:47.030 
quite a few and they're all ages even

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.520 
quite a few and they're all ages even
some<00:05:48.030> that<00:05:48.210> will<00:05:48.300> probably<00:05:48.630> crawl<00:05:49.200> out<00:05:49.380> in<00:05:49.470> the

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
some that will probably crawl out in the

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:53.900 
some that will probably crawl out in the
next<00:05:49.620> couple<00:05:50.010> days<00:05:52.400> so<00:05:53.400> anyway<00:05:53.669> what<00:05:53.820> I'm

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:53.910 
next couple days so anyway what I'm

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:57.650 
next couple days so anyway what I'm
gonna<00:05:54.000> do<00:05:55.700> some<00:05:56.700> sticks<00:05:57.060> around<00:05:57.330> here<00:05:57.510> here

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:57.660 
gonna do some sticks around here here

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:04.130 
gonna do some sticks around here here
there<00:06:00.410> the<00:06:01.410> lid<00:06:01.590> closes<00:06:02.040> good<00:06:02.250> but<00:06:03.020> just<00:06:04.020> by

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
there the lid closes good but just by

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:06.260 
there the lid closes good but just by
putting<00:06:04.440> that<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.740> little<00:06:05.610> bit<00:06:05.700> of<00:06:05.790> a<00:06:05.850> gap<00:06:06.060> in

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.270 
putting that a little bit of a gap in

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:12.110 
putting that a little bit of a gap in
there<00:06:06.479> a<00:06:06.510> lot<00:06:06.870> of<00:06:07.110> flies<00:06:07.290> to<00:06:07.530> go<00:06:07.650> in<00:06:10.970> and<00:06:11.970> lay

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.120 
there a lot of flies to go in and lay

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:13.490 
there a lot of flies to go in and lay
some<00:06:12.180> more<00:06:12.450> eggs<00:06:12.630> and<00:06:12.960> it<00:06:13.110> will<00:06:13.229> keep<00:06:13.350> the

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:13.500 
some more eggs and it will keep the

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:17.690 
some more eggs and it will keep the
chickens<00:06:13.830> out<00:06:15.950> just<00:06:16.950> like<00:06:17.100> they<00:06:17.250> meant<00:06:17.430> into

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:17.700 
chickens out just like they meant into

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:22.640 
chickens out just like they meant into
the<00:06:17.790> barrel<00:06:19.850> so<00:06:20.850> we're<00:06:21.030> set<00:06:21.270> up<00:06:21.500> to<00:06:22.500> keep

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
the barrel so we're set up to keep

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.329 
the barrel so we're set up to keep
throwing

00:06:27.329 --> 00:06:27.339 

00:06:27.339 --> 00:06:29.369 

also<00:06:28.119> in<00:06:28.269> the<00:06:28.359> design<00:06:28.659> change<00:06:28.959> something<00:06:29.319> I

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:29.379 
also in the design change something I

00:06:29.379 --> 00:06:31.979 
also in the design change something I
failed<00:06:29.979> to<00:06:30.099> mention<00:06:30.249> was<00:06:30.689> since<00:06:31.689> we<00:06:31.779> put<00:06:31.959> a

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:31.989 
failed to mention was since we put a

00:06:31.989 --> 00:06:34.469 
failed to mention was since we put a
ramp<00:06:32.169> on<00:06:32.409> both<00:06:32.679> ends<00:06:33.249> and<00:06:33.579> have<00:06:34.179> a<00:06:34.209> much

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
ramp on both ends and have a much

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:38.129 
ramp on both ends and have a much
shorter<00:06:35.789> compost<00:06:36.789> area<00:06:37.059> and<00:06:37.419> so<00:06:37.659> what<00:06:37.839> I<00:06:37.869> did

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
shorter compost area and so what I did

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:41.939 
shorter compost area and so what I did
is<00:06:38.289> I<00:06:38.409> made<00:06:38.559> the<00:06:38.619> bin<00:06:39.539> four<00:06:40.539> inches<00:06:40.809> wider<00:06:41.109> and

00:06:41.939 --> 00:06:41.949 
is I made the bin four inches wider and

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:43.139 
is I made the bin four inches wider and
we'll<00:06:42.099> see<00:06:42.249> how<00:06:42.369> that<00:06:42.579> goes

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:43.149 
we'll see how that goes

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:47.069 
we'll see how that goes
I<00:06:45.119> mean<00:06:46.119> you<00:06:46.209> can<00:06:46.329> see<00:06:46.479> in<00:06:46.569> this<00:06:46.689> one<00:06:46.869> there's

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:47.079 
I mean you can see in this one there's

00:06:47.079 --> 00:06:51.299 
I mean you can see in this one there's
still<00:06:47.319> some<00:06:47.529> room<00:06:47.709> on<00:06:48.599> the<00:06:49.599> sides<00:06:50.069> to<00:06:51.069> keep

00:06:51.299 --> 00:06:51.309 
still some room on the sides to keep

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:53.819 
still some room on the sides to keep
feeding<00:06:51.579> them<00:06:52.079> but<00:06:53.079> the<00:06:53.199> problem<00:06:53.349> with<00:06:53.709> them

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:53.829 
feeding them but the problem with them

00:06:53.829 --> 00:06:58.109 
feeding them but the problem with them
crawling<00:06:54.099> out<00:06:54.279> on<00:06:54.429> the<00:06:54.519> corners<00:06:56.909> I'm<00:06:57.909> gonna

00:06:58.109 --> 00:06:58.119 
crawling out on the corners I'm gonna

00:06:58.119 --> 00:07:11.100 
crawling out on the corners I'm gonna
have<00:06:58.269> to<00:06:58.679> start<00:06:59.679> this<00:06:59.769> bin<00:07:00.039> over<00:07:00.369> soon
