00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:32.119 
up you see it looks like a little zigzag
sections<00:02:28.950> and<00:02:29.280> when<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.299> place<00:02:30.629> your<00:02:30.840> foil<00:02:31.260> it

00:02:32.119 --> 00:02:32.129 
sections and when you place your foil it

00:02:32.129 --> 00:02:35.330 
sections and when you place your foil it
places<00:02:32.700> right<00:02:32.849> at<00:02:33.090> that<00:02:33.329> line<00:02:34.040> so<00:02:35.040> try<00:02:35.310> that

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
places right at that line so try that

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.119 
places right at that line so try that
I'll<00:02:35.760> give<00:02:35.939> you<00:02:36.030> that<00:02:36.209> for<00:02:36.420> free<00:02:36.890> so<00:02:37.890> we're

technique<00:02:40.879> we're<00:02:41.879> going<00:02:41.970> to<00:02:42.030> use<00:02:42.209> a<00:02:42.239> basic

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
technique we're going to use a basic

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.819 
technique we're going to use a basic
clipper<00:02:44.870> and<00:02:45.870> we're<00:02:46.109> just<00:02:46.200> going<00:02:46.470> to<00:02:46.530> put<00:02:46.739> it

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
clipper and we're just going to put it

on<00:02:46.950> our<00:02:46.980> head<00:02:47.280> like<00:02:47.459> this<00:02:47.579> and<00:02:47.760> go<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:48.859> not

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
on our head like this and go and not

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.140 
on our head like this and go and not
that's<00:02:50.609> until<00:02:50.939> are<00:02:51.209> you<00:02:51.329> joking<00:02:51.720> ok<00:02:52.819> now<00:02:53.819> I<00:02:53.849> was

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's until are you joking ok now I was

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.270 
that's until are you joking ok now I was
playing<00:02:54.420> ok<00:02:55.319> we're<00:02:55.470> going<00:02:55.560> to<00:02:55.650> start<00:02:55.919> a<00:02:56.040> cut<00:02:56.250> on

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
playing ok we're going to start a cut on

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.280 
playing ok we're going to start a cut on
the<00:02:56.519> short<00:02:56.819> side<00:02:57.060> because<00:02:57.659> it's<00:02:57.870> going<00:02:58.139> to<00:02:58.200> be

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
the short side because it's going to be

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.379 
the short side because it's going to be
a<00:02:58.319> symmetrical<00:02:59.099> it's<00:02:59.519> going<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.760> be<00:02:59.849> longer<00:03:00.120> on

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
a symmetrical it's going to be longer on

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:04.129 
a symmetrical it's going to be longer on
the<00:03:00.540> opposite<00:03:01.019> side<00:03:01.819> so<00:03:02.819> this<00:03:03.599> comb<00:03:03.870> is

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
the opposite side so this comb is

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.440 
the opposite side so this comb is
designed<00:03:04.650> like<00:03:04.799> this<00:03:04.919> is<00:03:05.459> not<00:03:05.609> broken<00:03:06.000> I

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
designed like this is not broken I

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.539 
designed like this is not broken I
actually<00:03:06.959> take<00:03:07.319> these<00:03:07.500> teeth<00:03:07.799> out<00:03:08.040> because<00:03:08.400> it

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
actually take these teeth out because it

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.460 
actually take these teeth out because it
helps<00:03:08.849> me<00:03:08.879> to<00:03:09.599> part<00:03:09.900> through<00:03:10.109> the<00:03:10.169> hair

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
helps me to part through the hair

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.339 
helps me to part through the hair
depending<00:03:11.400> on<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.090> density<00:03:12.629> of<00:03:12.659> a<00:03:12.870> person's

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:13.349 
depending on the density of a person's

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:15.949 
depending on the density of a person's
hair<00:03:13.799> I'd<00:03:14.159> have<00:03:14.879> to<00:03:15.060> part<00:03:15.359> through<00:03:15.599> the<00:03:15.720> hair

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
hair I'd have to part through the hair

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:17.539 
hair I'd have to part through the hair
that<00:03:16.109> helps<00:03:16.439> me<00:03:16.560> to<00:03:16.680> just<00:03:16.919> part<00:03:17.159> through<00:03:17.400> that

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
that helps me to just part through that

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.369 
that helps me to just part through that
hair<00:03:17.760> a<00:03:17.790> lot<00:03:18.000> better<00:03:18.209> this<00:03:18.720> side<00:03:18.989> will<00:03:19.200> give

00:03:19.369 --> 00:03:19.379 
hair a lot better this side will give

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.729 
hair a lot better this side will give
you<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> closer<00:03:20.209> cut<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.780> want<00:03:21.989> to<00:03:22.049> use<00:03:22.079> a<00:03:22.229> larger

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
you a closer cut we want to use a larger

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.430 
you a closer cut we want to use a larger
side<00:03:22.979> and<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.430> want<00:03:23.609> to<00:03:23.699> come<00:03:23.909> in<00:03:24.180> at<00:03:24.359> an<00:03:25.260> angle

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
side and we want to come in at an angle

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.619 
side and we want to come in at an angle
here<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.669> we're<00:03:26.849> going<00:03:27.000> to<00:03:27.030> turn<00:03:27.239> the<00:03:27.419> comb

00:03:27.619 --> 00:03:27.629 
here and we're going to turn the comb

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:30.860 
here and we're going to turn the comb
about<00:03:28.019> 45<00:03:28.590> degrees<00:03:29.090> from<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.269> scalp<00:03:30.569> and

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
about 45 degrees from the scalp and

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.080 
about 45 degrees from the scalp and
we're<00:03:31.409> going<00:03:31.530> to<00:03:31.590> just<00:03:31.739> start<00:03:31.979> to<00:03:32.340> remove<00:03:32.729> that

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:41.800 
we just come in and keep our angle until

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:47.550 
we just come in and keep our angle until
we<00:03:42.190> come<00:03:42.430> up<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:44.170> meet<00:03:44.500> the<00:03:45.510> guide<00:03:46.510> line<00:03:46.840> up<00:03:47.110> at
