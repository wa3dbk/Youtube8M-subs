 take the right end of the wire and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.890
 pass this son through the 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.320
 first period net you have them 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.899
 petals of the flower you will draw the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.850
 wire up to one end and

 put on a pearl that will be the heart the 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.949
 heart of the flower you will place it 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.840
 in the center and to fix it you raise 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.040
 you will pass the thread to 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.650
 inside the period 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.380
 x as I show you on the video and 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.770
 it's the pearl and now makes you 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.009
 are you going to play by spacing 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.820
 each flower of one or more pearls 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:26.970
 or even putting two beads put into 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.829
 scale like on the video to do 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.340
 this will put you on beads that 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.860

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.159

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.970

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.950
 three and four 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.009

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.090
 examples and I also explain how 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.490
 finish a jewel if you use 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.850
 fishing line for example 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.270
