00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello everyone just the other day to me on 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.450
 mail knocked out project representatives 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.429
 libre to asking him to rate it 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.970
 applications and if you want to do on it 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.590
 overview 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.530
 I thought it was really worth it. 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:27.930
 your attention and now tell you why 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:29.609
 let's go at first sight 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.890
 seem that this application is not that 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.140
 as analogue of shazam but by no means 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.239
 it is not so unlike application 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.129
 recognizes the song also displays the text 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.629
 and if you have to in English 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.030
 the text is automatically translated 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.370
 special source for translating songs 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.620
 as they say meet on clothes 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.760
 escorted by the mind in our case by 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.160
 health 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.020
 so with the first one here is more than good 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.059
 Separately worth noting background 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.160
 which fell not as musical art 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.559
 but the application logo itself is also made 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.399
 tasteful smooth work responsiveness 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.199
 of the interface 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.480
 this is one of the things that distinguishes 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.739
 an application from competitors in this 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.869
 applications and there is also a VKontakte group 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.390
 where you can find news about new 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.610
 servers entertaining headings and so 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.650
 then there are 5 menu items 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.049
 recognize it where you can 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.490
 find out the song of her words 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.320
 select where records are stored which 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.090
 you liked 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.600
 playlists you can add your own songs 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.450
 children 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.250
 itunes then to transfer them and all 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.710
 the story of your discernment is kept in 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.240
 The next tab is also a player in which 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 playing a melody after her 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.439
 definitions from here can also 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.920
 copy text and share social 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:37.140
 network 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.000
 check out the chip with the start of work for 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.759
 you just need to pull the tongue 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.479
 little things but nice how it works 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.479
 let's try 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.220
 In the future, it is planned to add a function 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.380
 view a clip of a group or a singer in 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.210
 the performance of which played songs 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.310
 also for all performers will 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.530
 added discography of songs you mean 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.000
 identified the song groups and applications when 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.070
 call discography rearrange all 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.840
 albums and songs of this group 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.450
 you can select any of them and 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.460
 translate no matter how trying to find cons 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.050
 but on the declared functionality of the application 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.300
 working on 10 of 10 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.550
 someone will say that is not enough function or 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.530
 the same chips are not all needed 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.750
 again the app is free and 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.610
 There are simply no built-in purchases, which means 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.410
 hateful advertising will not occupy 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.360
 a good part of the screen seems to me 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:56.830
 application worthy and specific 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.990
 circle of persons will be useful 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.020
 You will find the link in the description and in both 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.550
 Market, which is also a plus for me 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:05.440
 all subscribe to the channel put 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.270
 like write comments 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.270
 also do not forget about social networks
