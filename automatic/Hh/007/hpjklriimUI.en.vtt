00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.519
 for episode number three of the do more 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.610
 clash today I am in the company of a 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.460
 exceptionally invited his channel does 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.410
 more than 10 thousand visas a day if 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.840
 we can say so I'm talking about 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:25.830
 gianlu of playoffs 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.830
 good morning to all then as you know today 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.640
 I'll ask you some questions and the last one 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.460
 I ask and I will do you 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:36.190
 a question I chose in 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.770
 comments of my writings therefore a 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.079
 exception request for you exclusive 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.590
 therefore as the first question why what 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:46.510
 drowned I started by chance a little 

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.050
 because it was something they all did 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.600
 let's try school then I stopped for a 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:55.540
 bit for my bored and then 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.909
 began to resume and to follow how 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.370
 he really should have played 

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:02.230
 from the beginning I am passionate then because 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:06.490
 It makes videos clash hour after 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.380
 sold in videos of which they started from 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.830
 me federico de we always do some 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.979
 video then kannarith a little slum a 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 at the time they were on call of duty things 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.300
 so and then we discovered the videos of 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.450
 surprising me I learned how it was 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:24.670
 they did and told me why then we will have 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.110
 another private question can we more 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.840
 say so what to directors then that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.780
 we are broadcasting the ipad screen 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.159
 of his computer and then recording of 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.689
 computer therefore with did not cease to 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:42.869
 mirroring that changes from android to apple or 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.850
 minus the same thing as mine 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.240
 then it is never thought to stop 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:51.220
 there is no football club game for now 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.320
 still think since I'm still a 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.340
 quite generative level mind 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.899
 bass 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.960
 I'd like to get in now 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.920
 town hall at 10 and to try to pull 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.450
 come on as long as I can see then if there 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.649
 you will arrive or not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.940
 what is your favorite troop why 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.610
 i have the truth to my troupe 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:14.920
 tamers because they are too cool 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.450
 they are very powerful even now that they are not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.420
 you can pull out I will say that 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.200
 however they always manage to keep the 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.810
 their power and then they are not so expensive 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.180
 much compared to the in the 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.240
 compositions that can cost more 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.740
 yes the elixir that in seeds 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:35.280
 okay but also find that this 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.560
 upgrade with the explosive bomb either 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.870
 I still have them very much 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.830
 they are quite usable 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.070
 definitely decorate usable more 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.930
 strategy obviously because position 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:51.970
 minimal they can all die 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.670
 very quickly dominate 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:58.090
 however, there was still a lot of attack 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.830
 use them if you are more firm or trophies 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:01.570
 that tell me also the reason for this 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.730
 choice 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.040
 right now I dedicate a lot to 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.470
 get me because I would like to bring in eleven 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.230
 bellotto and still at the beginning ad 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.930
 get unique for powerful lot indeed 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.390
 friends then known things that now cost 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.070
 all of them better in ease than not 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.590
 nobody even knows ours 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.480
 virus but the last cannon is brought 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:29.890
 to 9 and then give a little all over the 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.760
 million or who has already spent real money on 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.060
 cloud cannes 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.739
 without counting the prepaid cards that i 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:40.209
 earnings with some applications for 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:44.230
 example however only used 25 euros 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:48.280
 used as a dwarf and then less money and is 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:51.670
 still spent according to you what i 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:53.110
 defects strengths of this game i 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.959
 strengths are that you can 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.670
 but continue for a long time is the 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.209
 defect that the costs really become 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.220
 too high to remain a player 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.750
 that does not bud and therefore this why 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.750
 many people at the beautiful game 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:11.920
 so before asking the last question, yes 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.159
 I make the request of the member who 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.310
 he asks when you finish clash of club 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.799
 finished in brackets what you will do then 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 requires or you think you will 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:26.979
 complete clan until the end I do not think 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:29.380
 who will be able to complete Greece 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:32.949
 he thinks less than in every capita to win 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:35.410
 superenalotto that together in a similar way 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:35.860
 so I believe he will continue with others 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.590
 games 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.800
 as long as possible then I'll see what to do 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.960
 because anyway the years will pass like this 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.210
 it is not and will still be the fashion yes 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:51.360
 they will add what to keep and after 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:54.669
 bags always usual yes therefore for 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:57.070
 conclude dhimmi fans according to you the 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:05:00.660
 overall rating out of 10 that deserves football 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.229
 club in my opinion football plains merica 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.810
 I would say an 8 

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.820
 maybe an 8 to 9 because a lot game 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.400
 fun and playable only that the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.340
 super if lately the latest updates 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:14.580
 have come out are all targeted at 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:17.680
 taller players though for now 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.860
 result in a much higher income and 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:23.110
 lower keane players results 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:26.530
 useful that we can only admire 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:28.150
 like Lecce, optic 5 in fact you do n't have 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.590
 that's not all wrong 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.020
 you were the one who gave it for now 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.360
 lowest rating a beautiful eight all round 

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.130
 and so kid see you for a 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.659
 next video I remind you to leave 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.669
 in the comments 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.770
 the questions you will want to do for the 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.849
 next you tube the will be chosen one or 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:46.069
 two 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:48.709
 in the meantime I invite you to pass on the canal 

00:05:46.069 --> 00:05:50.240
 to play clash of kain ita not created 

00:05:48.709 --> 00:05:52.399
 shocking that the American one is fine 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.899
 no matter they are always becoming 

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.149
 the bigger I make mine 

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:59.209
 congratulations on your serious 8,000 

00:05:56.149 --> 00:06:01.429
 with a bullshit of the 8,700 subscribers 

00:05:59.209 --> 00:06:04.849
 almost 9,000 like when this comes out 

00:06:01.429 --> 00:06:07.909
 almost 9,000 videos from the past on his 

00:06:04.849 --> 00:06:09.870
 channel maybe further a lot do a lot 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:11.820
 other video with 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.800
 the other member that escapes my name mi 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:18.960
 will kill when he sees this video 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:23.790
 erika here I have to do everything and also from 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:27.030
 gianluca is all beautiful and the landfill la 

00:06:23.790 --> 00:06:28.800
 charity not recovery is good because 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.700
 maybe it doesn't help couples to eat 

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.700
 it's not the best 

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.099
 then we see the child 

00:06:37.529 --> 00:06:40.099
 normal life
