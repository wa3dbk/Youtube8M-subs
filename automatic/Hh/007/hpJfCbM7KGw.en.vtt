00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
as you can see there on the outside of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.480 
as you can see there on the outside of
the<00:04:34.900> helmet<00:04:35.259> the<00:04:35.680> middle<00:04:36.009> one<00:04:36.190> is<00:04:36.220> actually

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:36.490 
the helmet the middle one is actually

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.640 
the helmet the middle one is actually
outside<00:04:37.060> home<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.599> probably<00:04:38.169> can't<00:04:38.349> see<00:04:38.410> it

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
outside home to probably can't see it

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.120 
outside home to probably can't see it
but<00:04:39.639> I<00:04:39.699> had<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.240> get<00:04:40.389> in<00:04:40.630> underneath<00:04:41.199> inside<00:04:42.009> of

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
but I had to get in underneath inside of

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:44.370 
but I had to get in underneath inside of
the<00:04:42.190> facemask<00:04:42.669> and<00:04:42.789> just<00:04:42.970> pop<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.330> out<00:04:43.419> I'm

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:44.380 
the facemask and just pop it out I'm

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:46.439 
the facemask and just pop it out I'm
also<00:04:44.770> the<00:04:45.039> same<00:04:45.220> thing<00:04:45.430> with<00:04:45.550> this<00:04:45.729> side<00:04:46.000> this

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:46.449 
also the same thing with this side this

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.809 
also the same thing with this side this
one's<00:04:46.690> showing<00:04:46.930> now<00:04:47.199> as<00:04:47.380> you<00:04:47.470> can<00:04:47.620> see<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:48.009> then

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
one's showing now as you can see to then

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:50.249 
one's showing now as you can see to then
those<00:04:49.030> ones<00:04:49.270> basically<00:04:49.780> all<00:04:49.870> you<00:04:49.990> have<00:04:50.080> to<00:04:50.169> do

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:50.259 
those ones basically all you have to do

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:52.320 
those ones basically all you have to do
is<00:04:50.380> pop<00:04:50.590> one<00:04:50.830> out<00:04:50.949> and<00:04:51.190> kind<00:04:51.340> of<00:04:51.400> easily<00:04:51.910> and

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
is pop one out and kind of easily and

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.600 
is pop one out and kind of easily and
pop<00:04:52.870> this<00:04:53.050> one<00:04:53.259> outlet<00:04:53.560> and<00:04:53.830> then<00:04:54.490> you're

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
pop this one outlet and then you're

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.159 
pop this one outlet and then you're
going<00:04:54.759> to<00:04:54.819> have<00:04:54.880> to<00:04:55.090> apply<00:04:55.360> a<00:04:55.630> lot<00:04:55.810> of<00:04:55.960> pressure

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:56.169 
going to have to apply a lot of pressure

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:58.740 
going to have to apply a lot of pressure
because<00:04:56.500> these<00:04:57.400> are<00:04:57.789> pushing<00:04:58.210> the<00:04:58.270> facemask

00:04:58.740 --> 00:04:58.750 
because these are pushing the facemask

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:00.300 
because these are pushing the facemask
out<00:04:58.960> to<00:04:59.229> enhance<00:04:59.530> play<00:04:59.710> a<00:04:59.740> lot<00:04:59.979> of<00:05:00.099> pressure

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
out to enhance play a lot of pressure

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.390 
out to enhance play a lot of pressure
and<00:05:00.520> push<00:05:00.970> this<00:05:01.120> up<00:05:01.360> and<00:05:02.039> apply<00:05:03.039> all<00:05:03.190> that

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
and push this up and apply all that

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.689 
and push this up and apply all that
pressure<00:05:03.669> and<00:05:04.090> line<00:05:04.300> up<00:05:04.330> the<00:05:04.659> screws<00:05:05.020> here<00:05:05.430> and

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:20.150 

line<00:05:09.699> it<00:05:09.729> up<00:05:09.940> quick<00:05:10.240> here

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.160 

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.610 

so<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.490> actually<00:05:21.610> pulled<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.180> front<00:05:22.510> pad<00:05:22.750> back<00:05:23.200> so

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
so I actually pulled a front pad back so

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.890 
so I actually pulled a front pad back so
you<00:05:23.710> can<00:05:23.890> see<00:05:24.160> this<00:05:24.480> and<00:05:25.480> you're<00:05:25.720> going<00:05:25.840> to

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900 
you can see this and you're going to

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.170 
you can see this and you're going to
take<00:05:26.140> this<00:05:26.380> small<00:05:26.980> little<00:05:27.280> silver<00:05:27.700> beats<00:05:28.000> you

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:28.180 
take this small little silver beats you

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.110 
take this small little silver beats you
with<00:05:28.530> the<00:05:29.530> indent<00:05:30.040> the<00:05:30.250> supposed<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.880> run<00:05:31.030> up

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:31.120 
with the indent the supposed to run up

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.580 
with the indent the supposed to run up
on<00:05:31.210> the<00:05:31.330> outside<00:05:31.690> so<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.020> shouldn't<00:05:32.320> put<00:05:32.500> it

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
on the outside so you shouldn't put it

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:36.570 
on the outside so you shouldn't put it
in<00:05:32.710> that<00:05:32.830> little<00:05:33.300> spot<00:05:34.300> down<00:05:34.510> here<00:05:35.460> I'm<00:05:36.460> going

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
in that little spot down here I'm going

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.310 
in that little spot down here I'm going
to<00:05:36.670> put<00:05:36.850> one<00:05:36.880> in<00:05:37.240> at<00:05:37.390> a<00:05:37.420> time<00:05:37.750> and<00:05:38.020> then<00:05:38.080> we're

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 
to put one in at a time and then we're

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:41.520 
to put one in at a time and then we're
going<00:05:38.440> to<00:05:38.500> screw<00:05:38.830> it<00:05:38.980> in<00:05:40.140> so<00:05:41.140> now<00:05:41.230> we're<00:05:41.410> going

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
going to screw it in so now we're going

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:44.460 
going to screw it in so now we're going
to<00:05:41.590> have<00:05:42.460> to<00:05:42.610> hold<00:05:42.790> it<00:05:43.030> hold<00:05:43.930> it<00:05:44.110> on<00:05:44.230> this<00:05:44.410> side

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:44.470 
to have to hold it hold it on this side

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:49.400 
to have to hold it hold it on this side
so<00:05:46.050> a<00:05:47.050> nice<00:05:47.350> a<00:05:47.560> funky<00:05:47.860> push<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.220> pad<00:05:48.430> back<00:05:48.700> down
