00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:50.440 
that there's money about which if you

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:52.680 
that there's money about which if you
equated<00:04:50.860> that<00:04:50.980> to<00:04:51.250> the<00:04:51.370> real<00:04:51.550> world<00:04:51.580> would<00:04:52.510> be

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
equated that to the real world would be

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.840 
equated that to the real world would be
even<00:04:52.840> worse<00:04:53.020> because<00:04:53.370> nobody<00:04:54.370> wants<00:04:54.700> you

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:54.850

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:12.300 
making money Italian god no it's not
gonna<00:05:06.190> happen<00:05:07.710> so<00:05:10.230> you<00:05:11.230> could<00:05:11.440> compound<00:05:11.980> that

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:12.310 
gonna happen so you could compound that

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.320 
gonna happen so you could compound that
my<00:05:13.000> interest<00:05:13.650> by<00:05:14.650> 10<00:05:15.010> when<00:05:15.580> you<00:05:15.700> involve<00:05:15.970> money

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:16.330 
my interest by 10 when you involve money

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.230 
my interest by 10 when you involve money
so<00:05:16.750> therefore<00:05:17.260> there<00:05:17.410> will<00:05:17.560> never<00:05:17.890> ever<00:05:18.280> and

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
so therefore there will never ever and

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.130 
so therefore there will never ever and
therefore<00:05:19.990> you<00:05:20.290> should<00:05:20.470> never<00:05:20.740> think<00:05:21.160> of

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
therefore you should never think of

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:26.570 
therefore you should never think of
