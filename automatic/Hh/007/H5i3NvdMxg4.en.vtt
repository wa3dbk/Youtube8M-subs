00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.810
 Was expected 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.570
 This mascot does not have a heart but he is able to show emotions he does not have 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.820
 brain but knows how to learn omar decisions and behaves as if he had 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.719
 lifetime 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.529
 this robot dog beats his brother who was much more mechanical looking 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.749
 the affective relationship 

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:22.109
 there is therefore an interactive dog that awakens the fantasy of children and 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.109
 adults and establishes an emotional relationship with them 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.609
 speech recognition technology photo camera and sensors 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.380
 tactile make you a pet that stores today inside ita concepts 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.330
 and orders and therefore organized a very expressive relationship system 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.750
 if today corresponds to the stimulus of fear if it hits if our court 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.750
 nobody if your ranks ran out 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.150
 the entertainment robots that establish emotional relationships with 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.340
 its owners advance by leaps and bounds 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.510
 the problem was not buddy-name science that generations is going 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.350
 taking form 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.950
 a second generation mercedes of the robotic family of honor result of 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.160
 14 years of research 

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.850
 This one delivered is more sophisticated than the previous one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.260
 has lost weight will go to the statut 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.080
 in addition to climbing stairs as his brother acquired agility and that life 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.490
 that back turn and also mark a few steps of dance 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.640
 well it does not also execute some tasks on a table opens doors and 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.800
 understands called program switches 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.820
 according to the researchers the humanoids that animals will be present in 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.220
 homes and in a few years 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.090
 not only for its capacity and fun but for its benefits and utilities 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.100
 However, that mythical domestic robot that should free us from the 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.310
 tactical work will come much later than had been anticipated 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.100
 the artificial brain 7 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.170
 adriÃ¡n far below the level of visual perception efecom 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.120
 and refinement 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.470
 demanded an autonomous humanoid robot with multiple utilities
