00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:16.070
 Although from scoach the xoom bottle that is

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.669
 Already there we could the small 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.630

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.970
 introduce in detail and I would 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.869
 say so we start right on 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.279

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.160
 bottle is constructed here 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:36.559
 For example, you can hook the carabiner 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.329
 turn it on to transport it 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.730

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:42.379
 subwoofer and much more 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.870
 and on the other side you can see 

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:47.499
 Also something else to offer 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.539
 It 's water resistant and has 

00:00:47.499 --> 00:00:53.989

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:55.760

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.969
 also the functions or the possibility 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.589
 that for example in the bicycle holder 

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:03.170
 to stick the drinking bottle because that 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:04.460
 just the size and we are already 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.630
 we have the green version here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.010
 we are now available 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.190
 unpack 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:13.010
 Included in the scope of delivery is of course 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 the bottle itself looks like it 

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.920
 are now different colors 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.020
 we have the green variant here 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.460
 present and we would like to be able to 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.240
 also like in black or blue 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.280
 to buy 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.870
 there is something for everyone 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.820
 Of course here the charger with it 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:27.560
 and this carabiner hook we there 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.540
 already mentioned there is 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.190
 here also with the one can then to 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.490
 make for up here right and 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:36.370
 take the part with you in the garden or 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.480
 in the park or wherever 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.370
 and that feels right I will 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.870
 that's just such a surface the 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.730
 splash water is protected 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.140
 how can you get the bottle you can too 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.310
 Just drop it there 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.170
 nothing you can see is everything here 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.530
 super protected because nothing can happen 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.940
 sure it is not waterproof with it 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.960
 you should not dive or swim 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.780
 Of course, that's not what it's all about 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 suitable and here on the back if 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.100
 Let's have a look here 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.990
 possibility once the charger over 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.450
 micro usb connect or too 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:07.100
 external devices via an aux connection 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.959
 Of course it can also do with it 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.030
 it is still protected splash water 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.239
 here we also have the buttons 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.630
 once yes, so to speak, the power button too 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.430
 blood 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:18.260
 to enable us to connect devices 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.690
 can and does have the right and left the 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.700
 possibility of music volume too 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.680
 I would say we start 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.720
 with our iphone the first music test 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 due to the design of the small box 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.820
 Of course you have the option here 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.830
 to enjoy a sound of 360 Â° 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.690
 and if you connect that, of course 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.460
 simply via bluetooth with his iphone 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.960
 with his ipad with his mac, too 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.150
 Of course you can always others 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.700
 All devices use one stop 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.230
 have bluetooth connection and do so 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.570
 Just stay here longer 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.520
 the button and can the device with it 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.020
 and switch off and now I stand here 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.220
 already siri with what I now 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.260
 Of course not necessarily now 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.280
 wanted 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:02.650
 we'll see, we have to do that now 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:07.150
 Look again as it flashes 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:09.620
 and, as you can hear, it also speaks to us 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.950
 we look again into the 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.670
 attitudes and say here 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.170
 connect bluetooth and how to listen 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.340
 has, we are now connected and could 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.280
 play music now 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.500
 and since I'm already spotify 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.000
 I started using it now 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.850
 Also here again and just stared 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.600
 listen to the music and you hear 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.600
 just say that 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.530
 the 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.910
 With 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.470
 beautiful 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.350
 there 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.910
 I have a bit of rewind with it 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.750
 also something from the song hears where a bit 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:20.690
 more in it 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.030
 you can it can sound so to speak 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.960
 In any case , he is not very good 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.820
 good he is good 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:29.080
 There are clearly better boxes the more 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:33.530
 sound deliver as bluetooth speaker here 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.190
 is with us the logitech bubis very far 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.530
 ahead 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:38.510
 and if you are there completely the music of 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:40.010
 the volume turns up because that comes 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:41.480
 small part also to its limits 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.610
 for the author it saves on everyone 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.250
 case suitable one has the advantage 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.240
 that it is splash-proof and so on 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:48.800
 sometimes a bit dirty 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.320
 It can be very easy 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.310
 Wipe off with the material used 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.530
 this is not a problem 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:57.080
 You have the built-in battery in there you can 

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.640
 up to ten hours mobile music 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:01.430
 Of course, that always happens 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.340
 on how loud this is 

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.450
 so the design is very 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:07.760
 handy if I just now 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:12.729
 Every iphone has about the same size 

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:15.530
 the size of about two iphones and 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.900
 of course has the 360 degrees here 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.669
 had not integrated before now 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.410
 But for so much bass, it makes for the 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.300
 sound enjoyment is on the way 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.440
 has enough in any case 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:25.880
 different ways to do that 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.500
 can transport up here, for example 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.320
 pull through the carabiner or else 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:32.479
 any way you want it on everyone 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.789
 case interesting product brings quite 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.289
 good sound with the cost 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:39.740
 recommended retail price of 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:41.270
 Manufacturer is at 149 euros 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.150
 There are the different Amazon 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.460
 Variations in different prices 

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.450
 the black version costs to 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:51.860
 for example 135 euro the blue would be now 

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:53.600
 For example, at 70 euro cost where 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.210
 which is ready to ship in two 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:58.220
 until four weeks 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:06:00.020
 and then of course there are still greens 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:03.050
 now here have the will with 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:06.680
 119 euro listed just like the color 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:08.810
 yellow and pink in total in any case 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:09.980
 a good investment if you have a lot 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.930
 Is on the way 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:14.210
 then of course you can take this with you 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.680
 to ride a bike to do something 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.880
 Of course, there are many 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.620
 many alternatives 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:21.140
 if you still have a bluetooth speaker 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.420
 looking for the splash-proof is and 

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.750
 sometimes you can fall down then you can 

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:30.220
 here in any case to the alternative 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.220
 to grab from scoach
