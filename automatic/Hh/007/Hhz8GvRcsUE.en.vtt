a name to it or displaying it as a
tactic<00:02:23.380> and<00:02:23.730> I'm<00:02:24.730> wondering<00:02:25.030> if<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:25.690> might

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
tactic and I'm wondering if that might

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.230 
tactic and I'm wondering if that might
be<00:02:26.080> because<00:02:26.290> people<00:02:26.800> consider<00:02:27.160> it<00:02:27.310> campy<00:02:27.850> or

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
be because people consider it campy or

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.220 
be because people consider it campy or
camp<00:02:28.900> ish<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:29.470> i<00:02:29.910> I'm<00:02:30.910> not<00:02:31.030> exactly<00:02:31.420> sure<00:02:31.660> but<00:02:31.870> I

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
camp ish I i I'm not exactly sure but I

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:34.470 
camp ish I i I'm not exactly sure but I
I<00:02:32.380> think<00:02:32.890> it's<00:02:33.040> something<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.670> really<00:02:34.180> could

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
I think it's something that really could

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.350 
I think it's something that really could
help<00:02:34.720> out<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.930> lot<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.320> players<00:02:35.620> that<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.610> see<00:02:37.090> and

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 
are two main spawns and there are a lot

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.710

of approach routes to those to and

of approach routes to those to and
through<00:03:55.990> and<00:03:56.170> from<00:03:56.350> those<00:03:56.470> areas<00:03:56.890> but<00:03:57.520> when

through and from those areas but when

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.150 
through and from those areas but when
you<00:03:58.120> are<00:03:58.390> in<00:03:58.660> and<00:03:58.930> around<00:03:59.260> that<00:03:59.500> burned-out

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
you are in and around that burned-out

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.430 
you are in and around that burned-out
room<00:04:00.490> there<00:04:01.120> there<00:04:01.660> are<00:04:01.690> only<00:04:01.959> two<00:04:02.410> ways

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:02.440 
room there there are only two ways

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:04.740 
room there there are only two ways
people<00:04:03.130> can<00:04:03.310> approach<00:04:03.730> you<00:04:03.940> they<00:04:04.209> can<00:04:04.450> or

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
people can approach you they can or

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.810 
people can approach you they can or
three<00:04:05.050> ways<00:04:05.230> actually<00:04:05.709> but<00:04:06.160> if<00:04:06.280> you<00:04:06.459> if<00:04:06.700> you

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
three ways actually but if you if you

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.550 
three ways actually but if you if you
sit<00:04:07.060> or<00:04:07.420> if<00:04:07.570> you're<00:04:07.720> running<00:04:07.870> around<00:04:08.290> in<00:04:08.440> the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
sit or if you're running around in the

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.900 
sit or if you're running around in the
right<00:04:08.800> area<00:04:09.100> and<00:04:09.220> you<00:04:09.280> limit<00:04:09.550> yourself<00:04:09.880> to

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
right area and you limit yourself to

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.610 
right area and you limit yourself to
where<00:04:10.120> you<00:04:10.240> are<00:04:10.450> there<00:04:11.020> are<00:04:11.140> only<00:04:11.200> two<00:04:11.590> ways

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
where you are there are only two ways

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.100 
where you are there are only two ways
that<00:04:12.070> people<00:04:12.190> can<00:04:12.370> approach<00:04:12.790> you<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.120> I<00:04:13.810> think

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
that people can approach you and I think

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.140 
that people can approach you and I think
in<00:04:14.320> again<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.040> every<00:04:15.340> map<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.760> will<00:04:15.910> try<00:04:16.090> to

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
in again in every map I will try to

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.490 
in again in every map I will try to
point<00:04:16.420> them<00:04:16.600> out<00:04:16.720> when<00:04:17.020> I'm<00:04:17.140> doing<00:04:17.290> this

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
point them out when I'm doing this

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.260 
point them out when I'm doing this
free-for-all<00:04:17.920> tutorial<00:04:18.400> series<00:04:18.609> on<00:04:18.880> each<00:04:19.030> map

free-for-all tutorial series on each map

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:20.970 
free-for-all tutorial series on each map
and<00:04:19.480> show<00:04:19.510> you<00:04:19.690> where<00:04:19.930> they<00:04:20.140> are<00:04:20.170> and<00:04:20.500> there

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:20.980 
and show you where they are and there

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:23.010 
and show you where they are and there
are<00:04:21.100> more<00:04:21.310> than<00:04:21.459> one<00:04:21.729> in<00:04:21.910> each<00:04:22.030> map<00:04:22.360> for<00:04:22.930> the

00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.020 
are more than one in each map for the

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.560 
are more than one in each map for the
most<00:04:23.229> part<00:04:23.530> but<00:04:24.190> it's<00:04:24.400> a<00:04:24.520> good<00:04:24.700> idea<00:04:24.850> to<00:04:25.090> find

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
most part but it's a good idea to find

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.060 
most part but it's a good idea to find
those<00:04:25.960> areas<00:04:26.530> find

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:27.070 
those areas find

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.880 
those areas find
heavily<00:04:27.670> trafficked<00:04:28.090> areas<00:04:28.870> and<00:04:29.080> then<00:04:29.560> lock

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
heavily trafficked areas and then lock

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.220 
heavily trafficked areas and then lock
down<00:04:30.310> an<00:04:30.520> area<00:04:30.880> adjacent<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.780> them<00:04:32.050> this

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.230 
down an area adjacent to them this

down an area adjacent to them this

around<00:04:36.640> it<00:04:37.240> is<00:04:37.450> and<00:04:37.900> then<00:04:37.990> you<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.320> run<00:04:38.560> back

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:38.920 
around it is and then you can run back
