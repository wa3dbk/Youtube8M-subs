00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
off because of those freaking creases

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.880 
off because of those freaking creases
man<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:26.560> crease<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:26.950> right<00:02:27.100> there<00:02:27.370> I<00:02:28.890> tried

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:29.890 
man this crease is right there I tried

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.290 
man this crease is right there I tried
getting<00:02:30.040> those<00:02:30.250> out<00:02:30.459> but<00:02:30.880> they<00:02:31.030> just<00:02:31.209> they

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
getting those out but they just they

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.090 
getting those out but they just they
just<00:02:31.660> form<00:02:31.840> back<00:02:32.020> up<00:02:32.910> so<00:02:33.990> I<00:02:34.990> just<00:02:35.920> took

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
just form back up so I just took

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.970 
just form back up so I just took
whatever<00:02:36.310> scrap<00:02:36.880> vinyl<00:02:37.360> or<00:02:37.600> yeah<00:02:38.140> vinyl<00:02:38.680> the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
whatever scrap vinyl or yeah vinyl the

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.890 
whatever scrap vinyl or yeah vinyl the
carbon<00:02:39.280> fiber<00:02:39.459> vinyl<00:02:39.880> that<00:02:40.060> I<00:02:40.540> had<00:02:40.720> laying

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
carbon fiber vinyl that I had laying

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.479 
carbon fiber vinyl that I had laying
around<00:02:41.020> just<00:02:41.500> threw<00:02:41.920> it<00:02:42.010> out<00:02:42.100> my<00:02:42.250> center

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
around just threw it out my center

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.120 
around just threw it out my center
console<00:02:42.970> here<00:02:43.090> I<00:02:43.709> think<00:02:44.709> it<00:02:44.830> looks<00:02:44.980> really

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
console here I think it looks really

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.970 
console here I think it looks really
nice<00:02:45.340> I'm<00:02:45.610> going<00:02:45.880> to<00:02:46.000> continue<00:02:46.560> with<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.800> I

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
nice I'm going to continue with it I

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.740 
nice I'm going to continue with it I
just<00:02:48.430> ordered<00:02:48.700> them<00:02:48.820> another<00:02:49.000> with<00:02:49.239> a<00:02:49.420> roll<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
just ordered them another with a roll of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.790 
just ordered them another with a roll of
it<00:02:50.280> Monday<00:02:51.420> so<00:02:52.420> you<00:02:53.320> should<00:02:53.500> have<00:02:53.530> been<00:02:53.680> here

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
it Monday so you should have been here

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.840 
it Monday so you should have been here
today<00:02:54.040> but<00:02:54.900> obviously<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.080> not<00:02:56.140> the<00:02:56.230> case

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
today but obviously that's not the case

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.370 
today but obviously that's not the case
so<00:02:57.850> I'm<00:02:58.150> probably<00:02:58.330> gonna<00:02:58.630> wrap<00:02:58.840> it<00:02:59.019> and<00:02:59.260> then

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
so I'm probably gonna wrap it and then

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.910 
so I'm probably gonna wrap it and then
cut<00:02:59.769> it<00:02:59.920> or<00:03:00.340> hear<00:03:01.019> bits<00:03:02.019> of<00:03:02.170> it<00:03:02.260> here<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.709> kind

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
cut it or hear bits of it here that kind

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.080 
cut it or hear bits of it here that kind
of<00:03:02.980> well<00:03:03.070> I<00:03:03.130> want<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.340> cover<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> sights<00:03:03.850> to

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
of well I want to cover the sights to

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.240 
of well I want to cover the sights to
about<00:03:04.330> my<00:03:04.450> transfer<00:03:04.870> and<00:03:05.019> go<00:03:05.130> because<00:03:06.130> you

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
about my transfer and go because you

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.910 
about my transfer and go because you
can't<00:03:06.880> really<00:03:07.030> bend<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.260> way<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.500> I<00:03:08.709> kind

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
can't really bend it one way and I kind

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.460 
can't really bend it one way and I kind
of<00:03:09.010> curved<00:03:09.190> it<00:03:09.370> to<00:03:09.489> the<00:03:09.550> next<00:03:09.900> I've<00:03:10.900> got<00:03:11.260> all

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
of curved it to the next I've got all

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.610 
of curved it to the next I've got all
these<00:03:11.590> creases<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:14.080> why<00:03:14.230> some<00:03:14.500> of<00:03:14.560> the

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
these creases that's why some of the

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.680 
these creases that's why some of the
curves<00:03:14.860> on<00:03:15.100> the<00:03:15.250> inserts<00:03:15.970> and<00:03:16.239> the<00:03:16.269> center

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
curves on the inserts and the center

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:22.050 
curves on the inserts and the center
consoles<00:03:17.200> a<00:03:17.549> pitch<00:03:18.549> to<00:03:18.579> do<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.739> that's<00:03:20.980> it<00:03:21.220> for

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
consoles a pitch to do so that's it for

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.930 
consoles a pitch to do so that's it for
a<00:03:22.150> carbon<00:03:22.510> fiber<00:03:22.780> is<00:03:23.110> there<00:03:23.640> let<00:03:24.640> me<00:03:24.730> show<00:03:24.850> you

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
a carbon fiber is there let me show you

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:30.690 
a carbon fiber is there let me show you
guys<00:03:25.120> my<00:03:25.510> room<00:03:25.989> for<00:03:26.200> Alice<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.560> I've<00:03:26.680> done

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:30.700 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:43.130 

so<00:03:31.700> that's<00:03:32.690> right<00:03:32.900> here<00:03:36.760> shot

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.080 

pretty<00:03:43.650> decent<00:03:43.890> actually<00:03:44.250> I<00:03:44.490> like<00:03:44.760> the<00:03:44.880> way<00:03:44.970> it

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
pretty decent actually I like the way it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.140 
pretty decent actually I like the way it
turned<00:03:45.240> out

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.540 

the<00:03:50.150> hardest<00:03:50.420> part<00:03:50.720> was<00:03:50.980> as<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.130> can<00:03:52.250> tell<00:03:52.430> it

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:52.550 
the hardest part was as you can tell it

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.410 
the hardest part was as you can tell it
kind<00:03:52.730> of<00:03:52.760> curves<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.330> know<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:56.090> curves

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
kind of curves you know it curves

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:06.010 
kind of curves you know it curves
topology<00:04:03.880> but<00:04:04.880> here<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.330> the<00:04:05.510> other<00:04:05.630> one<00:04:05.750> this

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:06.020 
topology but here is the other one this

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.700 
topology but here is the other one this
one's<00:04:06.260> kind<00:04:06.470> of<00:04:06.530> hitting<00:04:06.650> this<00:04:06.830> one<00:04:08.620> no<00:04:09.620> there

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
one's kind of hitting this one no there

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:21.800 
one's kind of hitting this one no there
should<00:04:09.860> be<00:04:09.920> that<00:04:10.070> better

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:21.810 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:48.970 

there<00:04:22.810> we<00:04:22.990> go

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.250 

quite<00:04:49.980> some<00:04:50.190> time<00:04:50.400> finding<00:04:50.790> these<00:04:50.910> guys<00:04:51.260> but

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
quite some time finding these guys but

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.420 
quite some time finding these guys but
overall<00:04:53.360> I'm<00:04:54.360> really<00:04:54.420> happy<00:04:54.990> with<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.470> rails

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:56.430 
overall I'm really happy with the rails

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.590 
overall I'm really happy with the rails
that<00:04:56.550> I<00:04:56.670> bought<00:04:56.910> and<00:04:57.800> then<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:59.730> a<00:05:00.000> black<00:05:00.270> so

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
they were black before that's a much of

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.600 
they were black before that's a much of
its<00:05:03.030> in<00:05:03.210> my<00:05:03.330> like<00:05:03.480> videos<00:05:03.810> but<00:05:04.800> they<00:05:05.550> were

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
its in my like videos but they were

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.990 
its in my like videos but they were
black<00:05:05.940> and<00:05:06.660> I<00:05:06.750> put<00:05:06.900> some<00:05:06.930> some<00:05:07.770> fire<00:05:07.950> on<00:05:08.070> the

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:09.000 
black and I put some some fire on the

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.720 
black and I put some some fire on the
carbon<00:05:09.300> fibre<00:05:09.540> vinyl<00:05:09.990> I'll<00:05:10.830> have<00:05:10.980> the<00:05:11.130> link

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
carbon fibre vinyl I'll have the link

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:12.830 
carbon fibre vinyl I'll have the link
from<00:05:11.850> the<00:05:12.000> vinyl<00:05:12.180> if<00:05:12.390> you<00:05:12.450> guys<00:05:12.540> want<00:05:12.780> to
