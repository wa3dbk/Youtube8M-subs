00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.480
 wins over clubs like austria 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.099
 Sparta Prague 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.250
 it's probably worth it even 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.440
 preseason period but firstly 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.330
 I repeat the friendly games no 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.779
 there is a control each control and we 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.039
 fit customized today again in 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.150
 there were no problems with this plan 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:32.219
 the quality of the game is slightly better than it was with 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:34.170
 Austriy well, I somehow know all this 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.710
 perceived as a working moment there 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.530
 the nuances that we are here the last two days 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.210
 discussed saw today that they already 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.210
 seizes here it pleases and the fact that there 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.700
 2010 or there 11 it is clear that 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:51.570
 winning is always nice as well, 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.570
 do think what step as the Crimea 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.850
 do in this today you had to 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
 act without Fedor pitch some 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.340
 options and model characteristics 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 precisely in the attacking construction of his 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.260
 you can select teams very well 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.750
 acted monolith worked fine 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.000
 bundle on the opposite flank 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.090
 smolovy did not play mail slightly 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.710
 try if someone has something 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.420
 it hurts not to risk because he 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:22.049
 all fees passed 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.210
 Well, and we try from what remains 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:26.850
 to choose the right solution is important 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.520
 damage but also present 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.040
 and accumulated tiredness when you 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:36.680
 felt in the second half that 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.540
 should refresh the game well first and 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.220
 banks are tired and 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.380
 manole i'm tired and here again those 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.970
 football player whom they give us a little faster 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520
 stand what we cook on canzonette 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:51.610
 today we decided to stand to make them 90 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.650
 minutes have already let tolerate although they have 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.390
 the urge was to replace but said over 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.910
 endure what is through the game by the way we have 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:00.400
 several days 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:02.229
 hogwarts about free therefore not here 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.840
 through this game another leap in terms of 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.960
 condition made last question dynamo 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.479
 tomorrow you can come back to Moscow 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.600
 take stock of this training 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:16.660
 collecting and evaluate those newbies form 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:21.430
 who joined the dynamo this is Ivan 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:23.709
 kerabit nora eggman Olya well form them 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.209
 same as all blue and white if you 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.650
 it means taking revenge 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.989
 historical form is understandable 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.540
 add already the whole game played and 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.370
 in that game it was already clear that she was 50 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:40.090
 America already suffocating in this game already 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:42.010
 there was more or less khz for something like 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.709
 although again I repeat it applies to them and 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.590
 all concerns a lot worked all 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:51.510
 work done therefore in this regard 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:53.650
 there are no complaints or there are some 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.299
 moments in the game 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
 correct location correct 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.430
 opening the right ball reception 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.660
 time him some nuances that us 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.549
 still bring to automatism 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.920
 the only negative of course is that but this 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.049
 minus whether or I have already several times 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.269
 confirmed that seven players do not have 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.860
 who would also do the work 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:17.410
 certain and we are waiting for the 12th to 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.540
 khz no longer brains were with us 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.360
 the volume that you spent here you 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:27.459
 pretty but basically what was planned 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.400
 we have not done anything yet 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:32.380
 problems thank God and the weather and 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.930
 fields and somehow everything in this plan 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:37.180
 we accompanied nothing for a minute 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.660
 was not to not finish something that 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.660
 planned 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:54.280
 VTB Bank was the first in Russia to create 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.360
 international financial group 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:04:00.040
 consisting of more than 30 companies 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:01.380
 working in all areas of financial 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:02.620
 of life 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.170
 attentive and professional 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.090
 relationship to each client 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:10.540
 competent and effective management 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.770
 finances are key to job success 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.770
 groups pick up
