00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.120
 -Jarrukenkä. 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.200
 Yes, the ring needs to change their ways. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.220
 It is not normal that man is not a normal person. 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:03.880
 Soapstone ... 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.600

 "It's Petri ..." 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.220
 Wonder you haven't got your muzzle yet. 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.920
 What if I pour the coffee on ... 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.220
 What do I do for you, log? 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 Well, it's not nice to see a guy in that state. 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.360
 Well, don't miss it! 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.840

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.000
 Charmed .. 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.800

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.540
 Repeat... 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:39.640

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.220
 Matikka is a jee and not in school to sleep 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.980
 There they study. 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:02.040
 You should be hard working at school to get the job you want in the future. 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.060
 -If you take another bun you will get free coffee included. 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.980

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:12.400
 * * SPÄDRE 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.720
 Otherwise, I came to work: 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.460

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 * Miscellaneous shout * 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.980
 I have taken with me a rubber duck and a packet of cat food. 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.000
 "They they ..." 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.400

 Oh ku took your ear ... Oh yeah! 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.180
 Now you have to come up with something else to think about. 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.180
 -Yeah. 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.140

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.680

 -So ... So today.
