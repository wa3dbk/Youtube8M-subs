invert the court to 2nd inversion so we

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.279 
invert the court to 2nd inversion so we
get<00:01:39.289> swing<00:01:39.530> back<00:01:41.890> in<00:01:42.890> that<00:01:43.159> corner<00:01:43.630> ok<00:01:44.630> now<00:01:45.229> I'm

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
you can see it because it's a little bit

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:57.310

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.830 
do is break up the court in arpeggios in
other<00:02:31.620> words<00:02:31.829> stretching<00:02:32.280> out<00:02:32.400> like<00:02:32.640> this<00:02:32.849> and

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
other words stretching out like this and

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.360 
other words stretching out like this and
again<00:02:33.989> I'll<00:02:34.200> do<00:02:34.349> it<00:02:34.439> an<00:02:34.530> octave<00:02:34.799> higher<00:02:34.829> so<00:02:35.280> you

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
again I'll do it an octave higher so you

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.610 
again I'll do it an octave higher so you
can<00:02:35.519> see<00:02:35.760> it<00:02:35.849> but<00:02:36.030> it's<00:02:36.150> best<00:02:36.390> the<00:02:36.959> the<00:02:37.260> sounds

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.450 

okay<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:26.840> the<00:03:26.960> idea<00:03:27.320> chair<00:03:27.710> then<00:03:28.190> there's<00:03:28.400> a

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
okay and the idea chair then there's a

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:35.870 
okay and the idea chair then there's a
lot<00:03:28.610> of<00:03:28.760> specialized<00:03:29.360> things<00:03:29.750> like<00:03:30.080> like<00:03:30.440> this

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.230 

picking<00:03:36.510> a<00:03:36.600> c64<00:03:37.260> and<00:03:37.470> breaking<00:03:37.950> up<00:03:38.160> like<00:03:38.850> them

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:40.240 
picking a c64 and breaking up like them

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:47.030 
picking a c64 and breaking up like them
physics<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:42.100> then

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.980 

there's<00:03:47.760> also<00:03:47.939> a<00:03:48.090> pattern<00:03:48.450> like<00:03:48.599> this

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:52.990 

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.750 

Oh

okay<00:03:57.390> there's<00:03:57.750> also<00:03:57.900> a<00:03:58.019> pattern<00:03:58.349> that<00:03:58.379> goes

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
okay there's also a pattern that goes

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:07.339 
okay there's also a pattern that goes
like<00:03:58.650> this<00:04:05.120> just<00:04:06.120> play<00:04:06.599> the<00:04:06.659> C<00:04:06.930> word<00:04:07.140> which

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:07.349 
like this just play the C word which

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:12.610 
like this just play the C word which
lining<00:04:07.920> off<00:04:08.099> the<00:04:08.280> middle<00:04:08.610> the<00:04:08.940> middle<00:04:08.970> look

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:17.479 

notice<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.739> can<00:04:14.010> play<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.340> straight<00:04:16.489> eighth

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:17.489 
notice I can play it straight eighth

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.009 
notice I can play it straight eighth
notes<00:04:17.519> and<00:04:17.970> these<00:04:18.120> are<00:04:18.269> syncopated<00:04:18.930> eighth

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
notes and these are syncopated eighth

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.120 
notes and these are syncopated eighth
notes<00:04:20.959> that's<00:04:21.959> true<00:04:22.199> of<00:04:22.290> all<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.470> all<00:04:22.949> the

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
notes that's true of all the all the

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.100 
notes that's true of all the all the
patterns<00:04:23.520> basically<00:04:24.060> then<00:04:24.570> of<00:04:24.690> course<00:04:24.900> is<00:04:25.080> a

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
patterns basically then of course is a

other words water between the thermofit

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.510 
other words water between the thermofit
there

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.909 

Oh

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 

00:04:51.919 --> 00:05:01.890 

yes<00:04:56.830> okay

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:08.969 

any<00:05:02.289> up<00:05:04.800> this<00:05:05.800> chain<00:05:06.190> that<00:05:06.490> bekesy<00:05:07.740> and<00:05:08.740> again

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:08.979 
any up this chain that bekesy and again

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.210 
any up this chain that bekesy and again
it<00:05:09.099> can<00:05:09.220> be<00:05:09.250> syncopated<00:05:09.940> steady<00:05:10.979> you're<00:05:11.979> sick

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:12.220 
it can be syncopated steady you're sick

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:16.340 
it can be syncopated steady you're sick
of<00:05:12.340> it

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:18.260 

our<00:05:16.470> and<00:05:16.950> then<00:05:17.070> there's<00:05:17.310> a<00:05:17.400> classic<00:05:17.730> boogie

and<00:05:37.070> I<00:05:37.250> see

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
and I see

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:43.840 
and I see
it's<00:05:39.870> usually<00:05:40.199> played<00:05:40.530> not<00:05:41.009> just<00:05:41.310> like<00:05:41.550> this

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.820 

usually<00:05:44.850> like<00:05:45.240> the<00:05:45.389> floor<00:05:45.630> and<00:05:46.440> usually

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
usually like the floor and usually

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:55.570 
usually like the floor and usually
broken

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:55.580 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.409 

let<00:05:56.180> me<00:05:56.270> do<00:05:56.360> that<00:05:56.419> slowly<00:05:56.810> high<00:05:57.169> higher<00:05:57.650> here

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
let me do that slowly high higher here

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.060 
let me do that slowly high higher here
see

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:12.860 

a<00:06:04.610> flat<00:06:05.610> B<00:06:05.850> flat<00:06:08.810> C<00:06:10.280> very<00:06:11.280> slowly<00:06:11.700> okay<00:06:12.150> now

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:12.870 
a flat B flat C very slowly okay now

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:15.050 
a flat B flat C very slowly okay now
that<00:06:13.050> I<00:06:13.230> probably<00:06:13.470> just<00:06:13.740> showed<00:06:14.610> you<00:06:14.820> what<00:06:15.030> a

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
that I probably just showed you what a

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.970 
that I probably just showed you what a
dozen<00:06:15.600> a<00:06:15.810> dozen<00:06:16.260> different<00:06:16.380> patterns

00:06:16.970 --> 00:06:16.980 
dozen a dozen different patterns

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:19.820 
dozen a dozen different patterns
different<00:06:17.730> different<00:06:18.300> ways<00:06:18.330> to<00:06:18.660> break<00:06:18.840> up<00:06:19.110> one

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:19.830 
different different ways to break up one

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:22.220 
different different ways to break up one
chord<00:06:20.220> basically<00:06:20.790> okay<00:06:21.180> and<00:06:21.450> you<00:06:21.930> can<00:06:22.050> apply

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
chord basically okay and you can apply

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.810 
chord basically okay and you can apply
that<00:06:22.320> to<00:06:22.530> all<00:06:22.770> the<00:06:22.920> chords<00:06:23.250> of<00:06:23.400> course<00:06:23.610> so

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
that to all the chords of course so

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.240 
that to all the chords of course so
there's<00:06:24.330> a<00:06:24.420> few<00:06:24.660> ideas<00:06:24.810> about<00:06:25.320> ways<00:06:25.800> to<00:06:25.830> break

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
there's a few ideas about ways to break

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:29.570 
there's a few ideas about ways to break
up<00:06:26.490> chords<00:06:26.880> on<00:06:27.060> the<00:06:27.090> left<00:06:27.360> hand<00:06:27.630> and<00:06:28.580> tomorrow

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580 
up chords on the left hand and tomorrow

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.820 
up chords on the left hand and tomorrow
