00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
portrait from a face photographed and

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.609 
portrait from a face photographed and
profile<00:00:20.310> and<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:21.029> same<00:00:21.300> face<00:00:21.630> for<00:00:22.260> graft

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
profile and the same face for graft

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:29.660 
profile and the same face for graft
facing<00:00:23.279> forward<00:00:27.349> for<00:00:28.349> illustration<00:00:29.130> purposes

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
facing forward for illustration purposes

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.120 
facing forward for illustration purposes
I<00:00:29.880> provided<00:00:30.359> this<00:00:30.539> face<00:00:30.840> facing<00:00:31.439> forward<00:00:31.920> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
I provided this face facing forward and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.670 
I provided this face facing forward and
in<00:00:33.030> profile<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.079> can<00:00:34.320> follow<00:00:34.530> along

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
in profile so you can follow along

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.100 
in profile so you can follow along
because<00:00:35.579> they<00:00:36.000> are<00:00:36.059> not<00:00:36.270> for<00:00:36.510> redistribution

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
because they are not for redistribution

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.799 
because they are not for redistribution
I<00:00:37.649> embedded<00:00:38.219> watermarks<00:00:38.940> on<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:39.329> but<00:00:39.690> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
I embedded watermarks on them but you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.360 
I embedded watermarks on them but you
can<00:00:39.989> apply<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.320> techniques<00:00:40.980> that<00:00:41.100> I'll<00:00:41.280> be

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
can apply the techniques that I'll be

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.090 
can apply the techniques that I'll be
showing<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.239> your<00:00:42.390> own<00:00:42.600> photos<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.770> first

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
showing you to your own photos the first

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
showing you to your own photos the first
step<00:00:44.370> is<00:00:44.579> to<00:00:44.730> make<00:00:44.879> a<00:00:44.910> selection<00:00:45.300> around<00:00:45.570> your

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
step is to make a selection around your

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.319 
step is to make a selection around your
subject<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.829> we<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.010> isolate<00:00:47.280> the<00:00:47.789> face<00:00:48.059> from

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
subject so we can isolate the face from

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.180 
subject so we can isolate the face from
the<00:00:48.450> background<00:00:48.660> there<00:00:49.469> are<00:00:49.500> many<00:00:49.710> ways<00:00:49.890> to

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
the background there are many ways to

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.830 
the background there are many ways to
make<00:00:50.340> selections<00:00:50.579> but<00:00:51.329> for<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.660> example

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
make selections but for this example

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.650 
make selections but for this example
I'll<00:00:52.410> use<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.980> quick<00:00:53.160> selection<00:00:53.820> tool<00:00:54.000> I'll

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
I'll use the quick selection tool I'll

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.639 
I'll use the quick selection tool I'll
use<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> size<00:00:55.710> of<00:00:55.949> 9<00:00:56.129> pixels<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.260> drag<00:00:58.260> over<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
use a size of 9 pixels and drag over the

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.349 
use a size of 9 pixels and drag over the
subject<00:00:59.190> until<00:00:59.550> our<00:00:59.699> face<00:00:59.969> is<00:01:00.180> completely

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
