 penguin like the little snowman who 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.540
 we saw earlier the procedure did not 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:37.340
 it's exactly the same the colors are 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.410
 practically the same ones of change 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.360
 only the design and application 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.340
 in water that as you can see well the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.680
 let's show other pieces that are 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.970
 beautiful and its subject we have told 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.940
 with what we are going to 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
 let's first of all speak a 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.780
 little bit of the materials for 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:56.600
 develop the project we will work 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.510
 with a little board he tells me that the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.240
 tablet has a length of 30 centimeters 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:04.750
 and it has a width of 17 centimeters 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:07.280
 thickness this tablet is 3 millimeters 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.930
 you are going to paint on planes then what 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.000
 what I did was schemes to do the 

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.670
 framework and you can transform these already 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.860
 according to pictures either in a tray a 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:19.610
 I have it longer and make a 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.050
 little more star already stopped last 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.390
 sample said transform it into 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.220
 flags to put a bias that 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.550
 had in the mix very well going to serve 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.890
 a state coffee and is in mdf the 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.050
 first part of the material in addition 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:36.230
 of material we are going to need the paper and 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:39.050
 black cardboard I recommend that 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.600
 use that disposable paper that came out 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:46.210
 of the house 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:50.140
 has a piece of bar 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:54.300
 in the mine a pencil but the pattern 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.300
 basically in loose materials 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.740
 and start the project first and foremost 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.650
 is that I want to present you a product 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:11.700
 new that went to market a little bit 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.700
 oven tablet 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:21.280
 is not called here he founded his code is from 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.740
 761 and how it has the color of the mdf and 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.160
 how important what advantage does the 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:30.190
 product that is a wood sealer and 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.500
 explainable and will guarantee no 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.360
 only the seal because we know that it 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.580
 it deserves to be a composite material already 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:39.550
 he has not closed the unemployment 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.259
 will allow to seal even more and what I 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.819
 I consider it more important to convert what 

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:45.460
 that will give me some surfaces 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:48.219
 good adherents where will guarantee me 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.500
 the good atmosphere of the produced the 6 

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:53.680
 then he fulfills part of those 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.979
 base sealer functions and allows 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:59.979
 as an anchor of line products 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:11.889
 acrylic the cold simply applies 

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:13.810
 this little board and the help of not 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.639
 we have to be putting bases 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.620
 depending also on the colors with 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.719
 those of us who work sometimes is not 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:22.330
 necessary to put the base white and 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:24.580
 right now we have it in that tone without 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.099
 But we are taking a tea a little bit 

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:29.259
 clearer well because we already know that the 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.240
 primary colors generally as they are 

00:05:29.259 --> 00:05:32.180
 first dark need one more base 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:35.360
 clear so that real 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.220
 of course this week back 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.259
 functions of the imperfect but the 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.620
 procedure simply so that what 

00:05:39.259 --> 00:05:43.729
 learn to use they will take 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.330
 preferably a brush of bristles 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:49.940
 soft with the idea of not creating brands in 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.509
 the surface then also creams or 

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:56.539
 simply not really of the ticket that 

00:05:53.509 --> 00:06:00.680
 do not do this just try to 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.789
 understand let's see all the performance as 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.610
 what kind you saw that is the 

00:06:01.789 --> 00:06:05.840
 directly on how to apply 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.669
 generally the people our world 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.919
 as for cappa we replicas 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:13.449
 often time and that only one if 

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:16.940
 everything is at the consumer's pleasure 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:19.490
 apply two layers all important one 

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.490
 once applied true in and dry 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.729
 let's apply a little bit with 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:30.050
 sugar and once the producer who thinks 

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:32.760
 that this goes from 500 understand well 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.430
 very good teacher friend the problem 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:38.510
 and we are going to make a small 

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:38.510
 cut and we return
