00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.600
 You guys, so I decided to make a video series dedicated to the ten principles of animation 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.960
 As described by legendary fans Frank Thomas and his Johnston number 

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.929
 So first principle is squash and stretch 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:20.199
 This is the principle that the animated objects get longer or flattery to emphasize speed, momentum, weight, and mass. 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.130
 Here's the bouncing ball that has squash and stretch. 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:30.500
 Here is one without squash stretching. See the difference? 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.200
 The amount for which the object crushes and stretches says something about its mass 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.280
 The more squash and stretch, the softer the object 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.840
 Less stretch squash, and object stiffness 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.039
 This first one looks like a water balloon and one second may be a bowling ball 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.119
 Squash extension applies to the characters too. 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.260
 Look how this figure extends from the speed it will come down with. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.559
 Then crushes after it lands, before settling in to form it. 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.910
 You can also use squash and stretch to exaggerate the facial expressions. 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.230
 Let's add some squash and stretch to this face. 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.320
 When his eyes are closed, his face is squashed, and when he opens his eyes at disbelief, 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 His face stretches up and settles back to normal. 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.159
 It is very important to keep the object size constant. 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.779
 This is what many people mess up with when we first try to do squash and stretch. 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.490
 They will lengthen the ball like this and pave it like that. 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.580
 This is what you should not do. The total size of the ball must not be the same. 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.270
 Even the ball grows taller, it also gets narrower. 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.930
 When it gets flattery, it gets wider too. 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.490
 The same goes for cubes. If you are going in line with one, the other lines must go in the opposite direction. 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.400
 The cube should start from the narrow, get flat, get narrowed again, and then rest. 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.120
 In-betweening with cubes is easy because you can measure the line between these two lines and then connect them to make a cube. 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.360
 If you master squash and stretch with cubes, the next step is to try to do it in 3D. 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.780
 Another important note is that the ball does not have to stretch for the whole time it is falling. 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:58.500
 When it is just the beginning of the fall, so its normal shape should be for the most part, 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.840
 Then when it is about to hit down, this is when it has more stretch. 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.390
 So do not overdo the squash and stretch in this sense. 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.760
 Well, that's all I have for squash and stretch. 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.800
 The next principle would be the expectation. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.110
 I hope you learned something and will see you guys in the next video!
