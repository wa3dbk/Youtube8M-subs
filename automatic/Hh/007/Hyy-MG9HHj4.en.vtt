00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 to greet all of them, it was necessary to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.450
 life so tonight I wanted to do 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.740
 a little video about dogs then 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.970
 be sure why dogs then everything 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.320
 just because I'm still going 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.580
 to talk to you about something that is pretty 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.320
 phenomenal a perception of the world that 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.680
 you do not have that dogs on 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.939
 is you going to see something 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.800
 of exceptional in dogs and we will 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.119
 study the paws of dogs and that's 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.560
 no distrust will allow 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.660
 understand how dogs 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 visualize the world is not at all 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.140
 ours and that these are dimensions 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.480
 additional to which dogs 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.200
 have access then there is a girl who 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.059
 sent me a little message 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.399
 on my facebook have good sir 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.620
 delavier can you talk about 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:44.730
 pads the dogs meaning 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.860
 frankly I never really 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.390
 asked to hand fondling 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.760
 sometimes the pad of my dog 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.559
 Vulcan and my dog azure gt2 collar 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.850
 friendly that I had a lot have 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.230
 slept together kind caressed the 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.629
 pads the idea there I put a little 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.980
 rough looking summer lying wood 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.989
 in the sun in front of the TV when I was 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.070
 little I said to my dogs then it's 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.970
 true I did not ask myself ten years but 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.490
 not the instructions she had 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.320
 small dampers that allow 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.790
 dogs to get the 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.070
 royal shock absorbers was successful at you 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.170
 lend very basic and this girl 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.570
 that I thought a little simple debate at 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.560
 departure sends me nothing on his 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.650
 facebook and I see she had a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.630
 big dog pitbull dogue de bordeaux 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.920
 others like that against everything he loved 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.080
 a lot that she sends me a little gives 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.670
 a little one a little too who found on 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.320
 internet on the pads of dogs 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.630
 so that can make you laugh at the start 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.960
 I open that and I learn in this name 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:40.340
 in this folder that dogs often 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.930
 sweat pads when they are 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.340
 excited and when they are scared when they 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:46.350
 helped the dogues when hilly 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.890
 are excited excited under the effect of 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 the adrenaline 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.479
 so he's a kind of perspiration at 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.369
 level of the legs under the pads to 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.439
 under the effect of adrenaline which of 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.990
 the excitement of fear or weight 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.670
 excessive surely so it's enough 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.600
 interesting from march to lille to the second 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.950
 question but that's why she 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.020
 does it transpire under the pads 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.500
 will that bring a better 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.909
 adherence 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.319
 there is a side that is weird no and hop 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.970
 it is simply others 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.459
 people of a brand and I think that 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.050
 some of the hecklers of that know it I 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.640
 think there are people ethologists 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.709
 who studied animal behavior 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.150
 who must have made the connection all 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.790
 simply because dogs are 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.709
 hunters and dogs when he track 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.239
 once they are not tracking all the time 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.379
 once not barking this behavior 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.959
 is to make it go 

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:31.280
 so he says that several reasons hair 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.980
 of dog they mostly have a sense of smell 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.019
 extremely developed and we yes very 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.470
 movie is above all an extremely sense of smell 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:41.599
 developed with that we are dogs 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:42.290
 confused looking for the drug that 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:45.530
 research 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:47.239
 people who have gone so these dogs 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.400
 that it will have to be very developed 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.750
 truffle at ground level to smell everything 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.220
 that they found to follow in the footsteps 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.540
 who could strong and sometimes too 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:55.190
 follow in the footsteps of their congeners 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.590
 and when dogs are hunting 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.239
 What happens it happens that 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 are not all of them next to each other and 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:02.870
 who follow both single file 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.459
 where a little bit more 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.180
 others and when there is one who is a 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:11.030
 leader when happiness begins to feel 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.440
 right so alas the track and the time 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.829
 because it's not the survival of 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.959
 species 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.450
 he would surely be before an excitement 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:18.530
 to the excitement of the hunter one who is going 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.109
 melt on his prey 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.459
 he puts himself on me annalynne bread 1 and 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.169
 at that moment he will sweat 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:27.590
 pads and sweating 

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:29.690
 pads it will warn the dogs who 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.480
 get behind that he scented there weight 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.980
 and that it is he who must be followed as 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.930
 others know its smell and in 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:37.579
 more know that he is excited and that he has 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.880
 released at the time this month they go on 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.010
 to follow 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.079
 you see it's a kind of means of 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.720
 communication that allows the dog to 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:46.940
 track and a weight and warn them 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.829
 other dogs only by the smell that 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.139
 go and greens that will leave the ground 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.750
 by the excitement of adrenaline and 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.919
 this perspiration of the pads they 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:57.560
 will tell other dogs that they 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:04:00.169
 have pissed the grind and who will repeat 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.970
 that they're going to get her I'm the 

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.560
 dog he found there for four months 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.730
 it's me that we follow so it's enough 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.639
 phenomenal to see how dogs 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.319
 get to communicate through the smells and 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.720
 without really wanting to say 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.950
 they emit waves hours 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:19.070
 like that you imagine you are 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:22.070
 pursued by one of the dogs and well one 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:24.470
 who you who sniffs at you 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.730
 renewing it tells all the others 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.710
 who sniffed you even though others 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:29.690
 have not captured your your smell it's 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:31.820
 still terribly effective 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.050
 extremely effective predators on 

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.720
 the wolves it was the same thing 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:36.650
 so see this little by little see this 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.740
 what does that mean 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.350
 and then even imagine that you are 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.780
 go back to a room for example where he 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.150
 y to your fiancee for example and since 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:49.250
 your fiancee is no longer there is part 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.830
 some time ago and you feel that 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:56.870
 your fiancee for example is excited to 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:58.490
 got scared one and you feel pretty much 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.640
 felt the molecules she left 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:04.190
 on his passing of excitement of fear or 

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:05.660
 to play to imagine the imagine him the 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.970
 change of the world you get into this 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.440
 restaurant you can not find your friend 

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.300
 and at that moment you sit on 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.490
 a seat and there you feel that your 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.980
 friend is very upset or your friend is 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:18.290
 in love then you are jealous or you 

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:19.820
 will be you will be afraid eh 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.900
 our friend is not there the parties but 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.700
 you feel case a question we 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:24.320
 sang that there is an event massed this 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.070
 is going on with the dogs while 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.900
 dogs 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.570
 thanks to their pads emit 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.400
 molecules corresponding to their at their 

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:33.320
 emotions if you want then that's 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:35.120
 pretty phenomenal because we do not have 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.520
 everything calculated surely but it must be 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.350
 the joy the fear the anguished 

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.060
 there must be several olfactory codes 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:42.320
 and dogs nine times communicate 

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:44.270
 like that through the traces they 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.350
 leave on the ground it's perspiration 

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:47.750
 at the cost level if there are dogs 

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:51.590
 allows them to communicate and be 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.150
 hunters extremely effective but 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.590
 also to be able to communicate say that we 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:56.810
 was still passing the dog passes whatever 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.970
 apart he can all you feel that there is 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:00.470
 a dog who has been there and feels 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:01.760
 the moods of this dog if it's a 

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.130
 dog who got scared if it's a dog 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.190
 who's excited or if it's a dog 

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:09.740
 who hold in heat who want to 

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:11.210
 to reproduce a good if it's amal who 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.690
 wants to mark his territory that 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:14.660
 agressive 

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.820
 you imagine you know that 

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:18.920
 Divine happened there about you 

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.720
 know a little time 1 

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.330
 and in addition you know his state of mind 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.950
 so you pretty much see there the universe 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.020
 in which in which dogs 

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.430
 evolved that is not ours at all 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.290
 this story of sweating 

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:34.670
 pads in dogs 

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:37.130
 its rating is fabulous it's a side 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:38.900
 wonderful and that's another 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.050
 perception of things 

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:43.850
 we are no longer in just the smell 1 

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.290
 we are in another dimension we are 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.090
 the smell associated with feelings 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.490
 so that's to say that dogs 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:51.380
 can sniff the feelings the 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.750
 anxieties and I see the pleasure of their 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.730
 congeners and like that they can they 

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.380
 can go on a hunt for kiss 

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.190
 anthony son of the guilty trailer 

00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:00.380
 were in front 

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:02.480
 and then as soon as the buddy track and then 

00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:04.220
 there hop they are sure they follow the 

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:06.070
 dog track trackers because this dog 

00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:08.420
