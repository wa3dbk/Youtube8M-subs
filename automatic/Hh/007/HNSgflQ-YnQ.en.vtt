something<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:04.410> think<00:04:04.560> about<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:04.860> this<00:04:04.920> day<00:04:05.010> you

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
something I think about to this day you

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.710 
something I think about to this day you
know<00:04:05.489> and<00:04:05.520> I<00:04:05.730> I<00:04:06.000> don't<00:04:06.270> think<00:04:06.420> that's<00:04:06.540> going<00:04:06.660> to

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
know and I I don't think that's going to

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.090 
know and I I don't think that's going to
change<00:04:06.930> whether<00:04:07.170> I<00:04:07.260> win<00:04:07.410> a<00:04:07.470> national<00:04:07.620> title<00:04:07.800> or

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
change whether I win a national title or

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.650 
change whether I win a national title or
not<00:04:08.250> but<00:04:08.489> I<00:04:08.760> think<00:04:09.180> it<00:04:09.270> will<00:04:09.330> help<00:04:09.450> a<00:04:09.600> little

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
not but I think it will help a little

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.530 
not but I think it will help a little
bit<00:04:09.870> so<00:04:10.140> that's<00:04:10.410> where<00:04:10.620> wrong<00:04:10.800> boy<00:04:11.180> you<00:04:12.180> know<00:04:12.300> I
