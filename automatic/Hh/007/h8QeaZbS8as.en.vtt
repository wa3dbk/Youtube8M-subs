00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
still on the 2014 - 12 X and now we've

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.740 
still on the 2014 - 12 X and now we've
moved<00:01:19.860> from<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.759> top<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.150> the<00:01:21.210> tower<00:01:21.420> now

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
moved from the top of the tower now

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.929 
moved from the top of the tower now
we're<00:01:22.380> down<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.830> pivot<00:01:23.189> point<00:01:23.430> on<00:01:23.640> the<00:01:23.790> -

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
we're down to the pivot point on the -

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:25.999 
we're down to the pivot point on the -
12<00:01:24.180> X<00:01:24.360> you've<00:01:24.540> got<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> pivoting<00:01:25.110> tower<00:01:25.350> the

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
12 X you've got a pivoting tower the

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
12 X you've got a pivoting tower the
tower<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.430> be<00:01:26.580> lowered<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.090> lower<00:01:27.270> point<00:01:27.540> to

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
tower can be lowered to a lower point to

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
tower can be lowered to a lower point to
get<00:01:27.810> into<00:01:27.990> tighter<00:01:28.200> spaces<00:01:28.530> so<00:01:29.280> we<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.490> have

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
get into tighter spaces so we now have

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.310 
get into tighter spaces so we now have
our<00:01:29.729> rods<00:01:30.060> set<00:01:30.329> up<00:01:30.450> at<00:01:30.570> that<00:01:30.720> pivotal<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.229> the

about<00:01:51.490> seven<00:01:51.910> seven<00:01:52.240> and<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> half<00:01:52.650> if<00:01:53.650> we're<00:01:53.920> at

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
about seven seven and a half if we're at

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.920 
about seven seven and a half if we're at
standard<00:01:54.790> level<00:01:55.180> and<00:01:55.300> basically<00:01:55.540> that<00:01:55.630> tongue

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:55.930 
standard level and basically that tongue

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.230 
standard level and basically that tongue
jack<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.350> about<00:01:56.560> level<00:01:56.979> right<00:01:57.130> now<00:01:57.160> so<00:01:58.030> if

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
jack is about level right now so if

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.670 
jack is about level right now so if
you've<00:01:58.360> got<00:01:58.510> a<00:01:58.570> seven-foot<00:01:59.140> seven<00:01:59.500> and<00:01:59.620> a<00:01:59.650> half

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
you've got a seven-foot seven and a half

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.800 
you've got a seven-foot seven and a half
inch<00:01:59.979> opening<00:02:00.430> you<00:02:01.120> can<00:02:01.300> get<00:02:01.420> this<00:02:01.570> boat

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810 
inch opening you can get this boat

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.690 
inch opening you can get this boat
inside<00:02:02.260> with<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.860> tower<00:02:03.100> in<00:02:03.400> the<00:02:03.490> down

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
inside with the tower in the down

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.820 
inside with the tower in the down
position<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.990> seemed<00:02:05.200> to<00:02:05.259> them<00:02:05.350> taller<00:02:05.590> than

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
position it seemed to them taller than

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.469 
position it seemed to them taller than
that<00:02:05.860> it's<00:02:06.190> probably<00:02:06.430> going<00:02:06.520> to<00:02:06.610> look<00:02:06.790> for<00:02:07.270> a

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
that it's probably going to look for a

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.169 
that it's probably going to look for a
larger<00:02:07.869> opening<00:02:08.550> stick<00:02:09.550> with<00:02:09.700> us<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.940> next

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:10.179 
larger opening stick with us the next

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.130 
larger opening stick with us the next
video<00:02:10.390> we're<00:02:10.509> going<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:10.660> show<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:10.899> we're

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
video we're going to show you we're

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.630 
video we're going to show you we're
going<00:02:11.260> to<00:02:11.320> be<00:02:11.410> doing<00:02:11.560> the<00:02:11.770> tongue<00:02:12.010> jack<00:02:12.310> in<00:02:12.520> the

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
going to be doing the tongue jack in the

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.220 
going to be doing the tongue jack in the
down<00:02:12.880> position<00:02:12.910> all<00:02:13.600> the<00:02:13.720> way<00:02:13.810> at<00:02:13.870> the<00:02:13.930> lowest

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
down position all the way at the lowest

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.230 
down position all the way at the lowest
position<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.980> then<00:02:15.370> we'll<00:02:15.459> do<00:02:15.580> one<00:02:15.760> follow-on

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
position and then we'll do one follow-on

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.940 
position and then we'll do one follow-on
video<00:02:16.510> beyond<00:02:17.080> that<00:02:17.320> but<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.560> tongue<00:02:17.770> jack

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
video beyond that but the tongue jack

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.750 
video beyond that but the tongue jack
for<00:02:18.190> the<00:02:18.220> tongue<00:02:18.760> only<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.209> the<00:02:19.270> ground<00:02:19.480> stick

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
for the tongue only on the ground stick

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.310 
for the tongue only on the ground stick
okay<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:21.820> in<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.180> shot<00:02:22.450> what<00:02:22.660> we<00:02:22.750> see<00:02:22.959> now<00:02:23.110> is

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
okay so in this shot what we see now is

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.800 
okay so in this shot what we see now is
we<00:02:23.440> have<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:23.830> tongue<00:02:24.100> Jack<00:02:24.430> lowered<00:02:25.360> all<00:02:25.690> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
we have the tongue Jack lowered all the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.020 
we have the tongue Jack lowered all the
way<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.989> the<00:02:26.200> lowest<00:02:26.410> position<00:02:26.830> so<00:02:27.760> this<00:02:27.850> is

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
way to the lowest position so this is

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.460 
way to the lowest position so this is
going<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.239> be<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.480> very<00:02:28.690> lowest<00:02:28.959> that<00:02:29.200> you<00:02:29.320> can

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
going to be the very lowest that you can

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.350 
going to be the very lowest that you can
see<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:29.800> boat<00:02:29.950> going<00:02:30.250> into<00:02:30.520> a<00:02:30.550> garage<00:02:30.760> without

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:31.360 
see the boat going into a garage without

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.330 
see the boat going into a garage without
completely<00:02:32.020> just<00:02:32.380> lowering<00:02:32.920> the<00:02:32.980> tongue<00:02:33.160> jack

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
completely just lowering the tongue jack

going<00:02:38.410> to<00:02:38.470> walk<00:02:38.560> over<00:02:38.590> here<00:02:38.800> look<00:02:39.010> at<00:02:39.100> our

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.790 

place<00:02:43.030> at<00:02:43.360> the<00:02:43.540> pivot<00:02:43.840> points<00:02:44.140> we've<00:02:44.290> got<00:02:44.440> a<00:02:44.470> in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
place at the pivot points we've got a in

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.470 
place at the pivot points we've got a in
this<00:02:45.070> situation<00:02:45.580> you'd<00:02:45.670> have<00:02:45.790> a<00:02:45.820> lower<00:02:46.090> Tower

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
this situation you'd have a lower Tower

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.059 
this situation you'd have a lower Tower
and<00:02:47.380> that<00:02:47.709> run

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
and that run

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:50.250 
and that run
moving<00:02:48.370> across<00:02:48.609> to<00:02:48.939> our<00:02:49.019> measurement<00:02:50.019> here

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
moving across to our measurement here

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.530 
moving across to our measurement here
we've<00:02:50.950> got<00:02:51.159> the<00:02:51.340> bottom<00:02:51.670> of<00:02:51.939> the<00:02:52.060> ride<00:02:52.239> as<00:02:52.420> what

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:52.540 
we've got the bottom of the ride as what

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.420 
we've got the bottom of the ride as what
we<00:02:52.599> want<00:02:52.780> to<00:02:52.840> look<00:02:52.989> at<00:02:53.170> and<00:02:53.439> that<00:02:54.040> puts<00:02:54.310> us

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
we want to look at and that puts us

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.509 
we want to look at and that puts us
right<00:02:54.459> at<00:02:54.819> seven<00:02:55.269> feet<00:02:55.480> six<00:02:55.840> inches<00:02:55.959> so<00:02:56.950> if<00:02:57.189> the

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
right at seven feet six inches so if the

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.050 
right at seven feet six inches so if the
trailer<00:02:58.209> is<00:02:58.540> still<00:02:59.170> on<00:02:59.379> the<00:02:59.650> tongue<00:03:00.430> Jack<00:03:00.730> at

trailer is still on the tongue Jack at
the<00:03:01.659> lowest<00:03:02.079> point<00:03:02.379> you<00:03:02.769> can<00:03:02.950> theoretically

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
the lowest point you can theoretically

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.399 
the lowest point you can theoretically
get<00:03:03.549> this<00:03:03.730> boat<00:03:03.939> into<00:03:04.180> a<00:03:04.209> seven<00:03:04.629> foot<00:03:04.780> six<00:03:05.109> inch
