00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:01.770 
I already won I had the fixture hooked

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:04.670 
I already won I had the fixture hooked
up<00:00:02.030> now<00:00:03.030> when<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.300> test<00:00:03.629> these<00:00:03.840> LEDs<00:00:04.259> I'm<00:00:04.500> just

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
up now when I test these LEDs I'm just

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.860 
up now when I test these LEDs I'm just
going<00:00:04.799> to<00:00:04.830> do<00:00:05.100> all<00:00:05.759> of<00:00:05.819> them<00:00:06.270> on<00:00:06.420> at<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.629> same

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:06.870 
going to do all of them on at the same

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:13.190 
going to do all of them on at the same
time<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.470> same<00:00:09.050> intensity<00:00:10.050> I<00:00:11.210> can<00:00:12.210> will<00:00:12.870> later

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
time the same intensity I can will later

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.289 
time the same intensity I can will later
set<00:00:13.559> up<00:00:13.650> the<00:00:13.980> individual<00:00:14.460> channels<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.210> then

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
set up the individual channels and then

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:17.570 
set up the individual channels and then
set<00:00:16.080> up<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.320> the<00:00:16.410> tank<00:00:16.680> while<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:16.949> work<00:00:17.190> on<00:00:17.400> the

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
set up on the tank while I work on the

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.310 
set up on the tank while I work on the
paint<00:00:17.970> of<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.090> cabinet<00:00:18.570> you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.140> all

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
paint of the cabinet you know that all

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.960 
paint of the cabinet you know that all
that<00:00:19.500> stuff<00:00:19.770> laid<00:00:19.980> out<00:00:20.130> right<00:00:20.699> now<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.910> just

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
that stuff laid out right now I just

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.029 
that stuff laid out right now I just
want<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.330> show<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.630> what<00:00:21.840> it<00:00:21.930> looks<00:00:22.080> like<00:00:22.289> when

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
want to show you what it looks like when

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.200 
want to show you what it looks like when
the<00:00:23.100> LEDs<00:00:23.490> are<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:25.640> so<00:00:26.640> this<00:00:26.970> should<00:00:27.180> be

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
the LEDs are on so this should be

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.919 
the LEDs are on so this should be
brightened<00:00:27.630> up<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.429> and<00:00:29.510> I'm<00:00:30.510> just<00:00:30.660> going<00:00:30.840> to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
brightened up now and I'm just going to

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.200 
brightened up now and I'm just going to
take<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.439> to<00:00:31.669> 20

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:35.210 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.910 

let's<00:00:35.540> see<00:00:35.780> what<00:00:35.960> it<00:00:36.050> looks<00:00:36.440> like<00:00:36.620> on<00:00:36.770> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
let's see what it looks like on the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.560 
let's see what it looks like on the
camera<00:00:38.440> so<00:00:39.440> let's<00:00:39.650> see<00:00:39.770> we<00:00:39.890> have<00:00:40.100> the<00:00:40.570> huge

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
camera so let's see we have the huge

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:55.420 
camera so let's see we have the huge
light<00:00:41.780> to<00:00:41.990> the<00:00:42.080> left

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.270

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
which you can barely see and then you

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.490 
which you can barely see and then you
have<00:01:09.370> hyper<00:01:10.370> violence<00:01:10.760> hyper<00:01:11.000> violets<00:01:11.510> true

have hyper violence hyper violets true

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.740 
have hyper violence hyper violets true
violet<00:01:12.740> which<00:01:13.160> is<00:01:13.280> kind<00:01:13.490> of<00:01:13.520> hard<00:01:13.700> to<00:01:13.760> see<00:01:14.000> you

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
violet which is kind of hard to see you

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:16.660 
violet which is kind of hard to see you
have<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.170> warm<00:01:15.650> white<00:01:15.800> in<00:01:16.010> the<00:01:16.130> middle<00:01:16.430> of

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
have the warm white in the middle of

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.120 
have the warm white in the middle of
each<00:01:16.850> fixture<00:01:17.240> the<00:01:17.630> green<00:01:17.930> a<00:01:18.260> Cayenne<00:01:18.890> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
each fixture the green a Cayenne the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.980 
each fixture the green a Cayenne the
blue<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.840> neutral<00:01:21.230> White's<00:01:22.330> lose<00:01:23.330> here<00:01:23.750> and

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
blue the neutral White's lose here and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.609 
blue the neutral White's lose here and
at<00:01:24.380> the<00:01:24.470> amber<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:27.110> there's<00:01:27.320> a<00:01:27.380> channel

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
at the amber and so there's a channel

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.120 
at the amber and so there's a channel
sin<00:01:27.860> over<00:01:28.070> at<00:01:28.160> the<00:01:28.280> few<00:01:28.490> July<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:28.760> have<00:01:29.119> the

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
sin over at the few July you have the

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:36.460 
sin over at the few July you have the
two<00:01:31.130> Reds<00:01:31.490> for<00:01:32.420> deep<00:01:32.690> reds<00:01:32.990> and<00:01:33.229> two<00:01:33.440> blues<00:01:35.470> and

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
two Reds for deep reds and two blues and

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.660 
two Reds for deep reds and two blues and
so<00:01:37.190> that's<00:01:37.400> what<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.700> looks<00:01:37.850> like<00:01:38.030> I'm<00:01:38.300> gonna

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
so that's what it looks like I'm gonna

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.420 
so that's what it looks like I'm gonna
dim<00:01:40.670> it<00:01:40.820> down<00:01:40.850> for<00:01:41.420> a<00:01:41.479> second<00:01:41.930> and<00:01:42.080> I'll<00:01:42.310> dim<00:01:43.310> it

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
dim it down for a second and I'll dim it

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.050 
dim it down for a second and I'll dim it
all<00:01:43.580> the<00:01:43.670> way<00:01:43.790> up

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.250 

maybe<00:01:50.630> you<00:01:50.750> can<00:01:50.870> see<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.110> color<00:01:51.350> better<00:01:53.260> so

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:54.260 
maybe you can see the color better so

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.100 
maybe you can see the color better so
that's<00:01:54.380> when<00:01:54.590> it's<00:01:54.740> dimmed<00:01:55.010> down<00:01:55.390> and<00:01:56.390> I'm

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
that's when it's dimmed down and I'm

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.180 
that's when it's dimmed down and I'm
going<00:01:57.260> to<00:01:57.290> show<00:01:57.440> you<00:01:57.500> what<00:01:57.710> it<00:01:57.800> looks<00:01:57.980> like

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
going to show you what it looks like

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.570 
going to show you what it looks like
this<00:01:58.729> is<00:01:58.970> this<00:01:59.270> is<00:01:59.479> like<00:01:59.630> less<00:01:59.960> than<00:02:00.370> right<00:02:01.370> now

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
this is this is like less than right now

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.880 
this is this is like less than right now
this<00:02:01.790> is<00:02:01.970> less<00:02:02.210> than<00:02:02.420> like<00:02:02.600> half<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:03.110> percent<00:02:03.620> of

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
this is less than like half a percent of

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.100 
this is less than like half a percent of
how<00:02:04.729> bright<00:02:05.030> I<00:02:05.060> can<00:02:05.330> get<00:02:05.510> so<00:02:05.780> I'm<00:02:05.870> going<00:02:06.050> to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.110 
how bright I can get so I'm going to

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:16.540 
how bright I can get so I'm going to
take<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.440> to<00:02:06.470> the<00:02:06.650> 100<00:02:11.200> so<00:02:12.200> right<00:02:12.440> here<00:02:15.490> this<00:02:16.490> is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
take it to the 100 so right here this is

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:31.690 
take it to the 100 so right here this is
about<00:02:16.940> 1%<00:02:18.010> brightness

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:37.330 

that's<00:02:32.300> about<00:02:32.630> a<00:02:32.690> 10%

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 

and<00:02:37.880> my<00:02:38.030> camera<00:02:38.420> is<00:02:38.450> adjusted<00:02:38.989> so<00:02:39.020> you<00:02:39.200> can't

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
and my camera is adjusted so you can't

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:48.520 
and my camera is adjusted so you can't
really<00:02:39.620> tell<00:02:40.300> well<00:02:41.300> take<00:02:41.540> it<00:02:41.569> up<00:02:41.750> to

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:50.380 

and<00:02:48.620> right<00:02:49.250> here<00:02:49.490> is<00:02:49.640> a<00:02:49.670> hundred<00:02:50.300> percent

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.390 
and right here is a hundred percent

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.100 
and right here is a hundred percent
brightness

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:56.290 

and<00:02:54.680> you<00:02:54.770> have<00:02:54.890> my<00:02:55.040> camera<00:02:55.280> adjusted<00:02:56.030> by<00:02:56.240> as
