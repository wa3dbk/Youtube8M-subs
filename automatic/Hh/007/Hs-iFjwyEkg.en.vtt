purple<00:01:37.380> dick<00:01:37.650> EULA<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.430> can<00:01:38.610> see<00:01:38.759> that

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
purple dick EULA and you can see that

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.910 
purple dick EULA and you can see that
that<00:01:39.000> this<00:01:39.390> is<00:01:39.540> about<00:01:39.720> dead<00:01:39.960> center<00:01:40.320> all<00:01:40.770> right

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
that this is about dead center all right

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.389 
that this is about dead center all right
now<00:01:42.049> the<00:01:43.049> reason<00:01:43.409> why<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:43.560> believe<00:01:43.950> in<00:01:44.100> moving

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
now the reason why I believe in moving

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.270 
now the reason why I believe in moving
the<00:01:44.490> ball<00:01:44.670> is<00:01:44.939> because<00:01:45.439> 72<00:01:46.439> wedges<00:01:46.799> is<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.130> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
the ball is because 72 wedges is at the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.859 
the ball is because 72 wedges is at the
very<00:01:47.460> base<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.970> swing<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.630> center

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
very base of your swing is in the center

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.359 
very base of your swing is in the center
of<00:01:48.930> our<00:01:49.049> stance<00:01:49.439> which<00:01:49.710> would<00:01:49.920> be<00:01:50.040> where<00:01:50.250> our

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
of our stance which would be where our

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.090 
of our stance which would be where our
spine<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.880> and<00:01:51.810> so<00:01:52.140> that's<00:01:52.530> what<00:01:52.710> we<00:01:52.829> want<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
spine is and so that's what we want the

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.649 
spine is and so that's what we want the
ball<00:01:53.280> because<00:01:53.460> that's<00:01:53.820> coming<00:01:54.149> down<00:01:54.299> in<00:01:54.540> the

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
ball because that's coming down in the

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.780 
ball because that's coming down in the
center<00:01:54.869> of<00:01:55.020> our<00:01:55.200> stance<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:56.070> as<00:01:56.219> clubs<00:01:56.579> get

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
center of our stance but as clubs get

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
center of our stance but as clubs get
less<00:01:56.969> loft<00:01:57.270> six<00:01:57.630> five<00:01:57.869> four<00:01:57.899> three<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.710> know

less loft six five four three you know

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
less loft six five four three you know
if<00:01:58.890> you<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.130> a<00:01:59.219> three<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.729> in<00:01:59.850> your<00:01:59.969> family

if you go to a three and in your family
which<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.960> moved<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.740> move<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.070> ball<00:02:02.250> forward

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
which we moved we move the ball forward

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.639 
which we moved we move the ball forward
or<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.969> body<00:02:03.119> moves<00:02:03.390> a<00:02:03.540> little<00:02:03.659> bit<00:02:03.899> backwards

lower left shift and you slide into vol
you<00:02:41.200> can<00:02:41.350> the<00:02:41.800> tendency<00:02:42.460> is<00:02:42.490> still<00:02:42.850> that<00:02:43.060> you

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
you can the tendency is still that you

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.870 
you can the tendency is still that you
have<00:02:43.540> to<00:02:43.690> slide<00:02:43.900> more<00:02:44.260> to<00:02:44.410> get<00:02:44.560> there<00:02:44.830> and<00:02:45.010> and

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
have to slide more to get there and and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.030 
have to slide more to get there and and
now<00:02:46.300> when<00:02:46.480> you're<00:02:46.660> too<00:02:47.110> much<00:02:47.260> slide<00:02:47.560> gets<00:02:47.920> you

now when you're too much slide gets you

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.250 
now when you're too much slide gets you
moving<00:02:48.190> too<00:02:48.460> much<00:02:48.490> and<00:02:48.880> it<00:02:49.270> affects<00:02:50.140> the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
moving too much and it affects the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.500 
moving too much and it affects the
concept<00:02:50.710> how<00:02:51.610> well<00:02:51.820> you<00:02:51.970> hit<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.240> ball<00:02:52.360> in

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
concept how well you hit the ball in

too far forward being ahead you get the

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.420 
too far forward being ahead you get the

impact a little late the ball is going

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.580 
impact a little late the ball is going
to<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.120> right<00:03:07.300> then<00:03:07.810> and<00:03:07.990> then<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.380> slow

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
to to the right then and then you slow

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.840 
to to the right then and then you slow
down<00:03:08.770> a<00:03:08.830> little<00:03:08.980> bit<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.340> you<00:03:09.400> can<00:03:09.430> pull<00:03:09.730> out

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
down a little bit and you can pull out

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.540 
down a little bit and you can pull out
of<00:03:09.880> the<00:03:10.000> shot<00:03:10.210> and<00:03:10.360> stop<00:03:10.570> getting<00:03:10.870> pulse<00:03:11.520> so<00:03:12.520> I

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
of the shot and stop getting pulse so I

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.580 
of the shot and stop getting pulse so I
think<00:03:12.700> I<00:03:13.030> think<00:03:13.390> it's<00:03:13.540> very<00:03:13.810> very<00:03:14.350> very

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
think I think it's very very very

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.220 
think I think it's very very very
dangerous<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.640> move<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.210> ball<00:03:16.360> forward<00:03:16.570> for

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
dangerous to move the ball forward for

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.720 
dangerous to move the ball forward for

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
and because I think it's just too much

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.220

from myself to DJ in all my students
this<00:03:51.640> is<00:03:51.820> proved<00:03:52.060> to<00:03:52.180> be<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.450> best<00:03:52.630> because

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
this is proved to be the best because

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.690 
this is proved to be the best because
it's<00:03:53.470> the<00:03:53.590> best<00:03:53.620> place<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.160> keep<00:03:54.310> the<00:03:54.460> spine

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
it's the best place to keep the spine

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.250 
it's the best place to keep the spine
angle<00:03:54.880> still<00:03:55.210> and<00:03:55.360> we<00:03:55.450> know<00:03:55.600> we<00:03:55.810> want<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.140> head

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
angle still and we know we want the head

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.840 
angle still and we know we want the head
staying<00:03:56.560> still<00:03:56.800> from<00:03:57.010> from<00:03:57.400> take<00:03:57.580> away<00:03:57.790> to

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
staying still from from take away to

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.720 
staying still from from take away to
impact<00:03:58.300> and<00:03:58.860> that's<00:03:59.860> the<00:04:00.100> best<00:04:00.280> way<00:04:00.430> to<00:04:00.490> do<00:04:00.700> it

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:00.730 
impact and that's the best way to do it

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:03.030 
impact and that's the best way to do it
and<00:04:00.970> therefore<00:04:01.570> with<00:04:02.380> the<00:04:02.530> narrower<00:04:02.860> stance

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.040 
and therefore with the narrower stance

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.760 
and therefore with the narrower stance
that<00:04:03.220> we<00:04:03.460> that<00:04:03.940> that<00:04:04.270> we<00:04:04.420> use<00:04:04.660> in<00:04:04.930> the<00:04:05.470> sweat

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
that we that that we use in the sweat

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:07.500 
that we that that we use in the sweat
and<00:04:05.800> the<00:04:05.980> search<00:04:06.220> swing<00:04:06.550> the<00:04:07.000> fact<00:04:07.300> is<00:04:07.480> that

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
and the search swing the fact is that

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:09.150 
and the search swing the fact is that
that<00:04:07.960> the<00:04:08.110> ball<00:04:08.290> doesn't<00:04:08.470> move<00:04:08.740> that<00:04:08.800> far

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.160 
that the ball doesn't move that far

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.650 
that the ball doesn't move that far
nothing<00:04:09.520> anything<00:04:09.880> more<00:04:10.060> than<00:04:10.120> maybe<00:04:10.330> two<00:04:10.630> or

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
nothing anything more than maybe two or

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.320 
nothing anything more than maybe two or
three<00:04:10.750> inches<00:04:11.020> at<00:04:11.230> the<00:04:11.260> max<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.250> I<00:04:12.550> think<00:04:13.030> you'd

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:13.330 
three inches at the max so I think you'd

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:15.630 
three inches at the max so I think you'd
be<00:04:13.450> a<00:04:13.480> lot<00:04:13.630> safer<00:04:13.870> to<00:04:14.290> play<00:04:14.470> the<00:04:14.590> ball<00:04:14.770> as<00:04:14.980> you

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:15.640 
be a lot safer to play the ball as you

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:17.760 
be a lot safer to play the ball as you
just<00:04:15.850> described<00:04:16.720> that<00:04:16.900> that<00:04:16.960> i<00:04:17.200> teach<00:04:17.500> from

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:51.160 
a machine on a swing weighing machine

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.230 
a machine on a swing weighing machine
and<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.340> wretched<00:04:51.760> the<00:04:51.850> way<00:04:51.940> to<00:04:52.000> the<00:04:52.150> head

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
and a wretched the way to the head

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.910 
and a wretched the way to the head
versus<00:04:52.660> the<00:04:53.050> rest<00:04:53.230> of<00:04:53.350> the<00:04:53.410> club<00:04:53.620> and<00:04:53.650> they

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
versus the rest of the club and they

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.530 
versus the rest of the club and they
would<00:04:54.100> give<00:04:54.280> you<00:04:54.370> a<00:04:54.400> swing<00:04:54.670> weight<00:04:54.820> that<00:04:55.300> went

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:55.540 
would give you a swing weight that went

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.540 
would give you a swing weight that went
to<00:04:55.630> another<00:04:55.990> level<00:04:56.860> way<00:04:57.220> up<00:04:57.370> in<00:04:57.490> the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
to another level way up in the

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:00.090 
to another level way up in the
stratosphere<00:04:57.760> when<00:04:58.210> they<00:04:58.300> went<00:04:58.480> to<00:04:58.540> to<00:04:59.200> what

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:00.100 
stratosphere when they went to to what

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:03.390 
stratosphere when they went to to what
they<00:05:00.250> call<00:05:00.810> shout<00:05:01.810> out<00:05:02.020> taking<00:05:02.920> your<00:05:03.010> shafts

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:03.400 
they call shout out taking your shafts

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:05.640 
they call shout out taking your shafts
and<00:05:03.520> getting<00:05:03.850> and<00:05:04.450> frequency<00:05:04.990> them<00:05:05.140> when<00:05:05.590> they

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:05.650 
and getting and frequency them when they

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.110 
and getting and frequency them when they
frequency<00:05:06.100> is<00:05:06.190> shaft<00:05:06.430> they<00:05:06.580> lock<00:05:06.820> it<00:05:06.970> in<00:05:07.090> and

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
frequency is shaft they lock it in and

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.940 
frequency is shaft they lock it in and
they<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:07.540> they<00:05:07.990> just<00:05:08.020> pull<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.530> shaft<00:05:08.770> down

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:08.950 
they just they just pull the shaft down

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.970 
they just they just pull the shaft down
and<00:05:09.370> it<00:05:09.460> vibrates<00:05:09.880> it<00:05:10.000> measures<00:05:10.390> a<00:05:10.980> vibration

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
and it vibrates it measures a vibration

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.980 
and it vibrates it measures a vibration
and<00:05:12.130> the<00:05:12.760> amount<00:05:13.000> of<00:05:13.060> vibrations<00:05:13.600> really

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
and the amount of vibrations really

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:16.140 
and the amount of vibrations really
tells<00:05:14.290> the<00:05:14.380> the<00:05:14.740> frequency<00:05:15.190> or<00:05:15.580> the<00:05:15.640> stiffness

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:16.150 
tells the the frequency or the stiffness

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:18.300 
tells the the frequency or the stiffness
of<00:05:16.240> the<00:05:16.300> shaft<00:05:16.360> to<00:05:16.720> a<00:05:16.780> lot<00:05:17.140> type<00:05:17.440> tighter

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:18.310 
of the shaft to a lot type tighter

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:20.550 
of the shaft to a lot type tighter
margins<00:05:18.730> and<00:05:19.090> that<00:05:19.690> that's<00:05:19.930> really<00:05:20.260> good<00:05:20.440> and

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:20.560 
margins and that that's really good and

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.230 
margins and that that's really good and
some<00:05:20.980> get<00:05:21.130> it<00:05:21.220> even<00:05:21.310> tighter<00:05:21.610> when<00:05:21.880> a<00:05:22.000> pure

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.240 
some get it even tighter when a pure

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.090 
some get it even tighter when a pure
their<00:05:22.420> shafts<00:05:22.690> because<00:05:23.350> now<00:05:23.500> they<00:05:23.680> can<00:05:23.860> find

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
their shafts because now they can find

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.280 
their shafts because now they can find
out<00:05:24.250> exactly<00:05:24.640> what<00:05:24.820> a<00:05:24.850> chef's<00:05:25.120> is<00:05:25.810> supposed<00:05:26.200> to

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:26.290 
out exactly what a chef's is supposed to

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:27.780 
out exactly what a chef's is supposed to
be<00:05:26.350> put<00:05:26.560> in<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.770> club<00:05:26.980> relative<00:05:27.400> to<00:05:27.520> the<00:05:27.610> face

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:27.790 
be put in the club relative to the face

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:30.210 
be put in the club relative to the face
and<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.810> that<00:05:29.170> tightens<00:05:29.560> that<00:05:29.710> up<00:05:29.800> even<00:05:30.100> more

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
and that that tightens that up even more

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.580 
and that that tightens that up even more
but<00:05:30.460> in<00:05:30.550> the<00:05:30.670> end<00:05:30.790> the<00:05:31.630> MOI<00:05:31.900> is<00:05:32.050> taking<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.500> to

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
but in the end the MOI is taking it to

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.140 
but in the end the MOI is taking it to
another<00:05:32.680> level<00:05:32.920> because<00:05:33.160> that<00:05:33.430> that<00:05:33.670> involves

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
another level because that that involves

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.600 
another level because that that involves
again<00:05:34.690> how<00:05:34.840> the<00:05:34.900> shaft<00:05:35.170> kicks<00:05:35.470> in<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.370> I

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
again how the shaft kicks in and so I

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.520 
again how the shaft kicks in and so I
guess<00:05:36.700> I<00:05:37.180> would<00:05:37.360> agree<00:05:37.510> with<00:05:37.570> moi<00:05:37.900> all<00:05:38.260> our

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:38.530 
guess I would agree with moi all our

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:40.500 
guess I would agree with moi all our
certified<00:05:38.950> club<00:05:39.640> fit<00:05:39.820> is<00:05:39.940> that<00:05:40.120> that<00:05:40.300> are<00:05:40.420> on<00:05:40.480> a

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
certified club fit is that that are on a

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.290 
certified club fit is that that are on a
swing<00:05:40.750> surgeon<00:05:41.110> site<00:05:41.290> are<00:05:41.740> all<00:05:41.950> do<00:05:42.340> all<00:05:42.550> do<00:05:43.000> moi

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
swing surgeon site are all do all do moi

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.640 
swing surgeon site are all do all do moi
because<00:05:43.690> that's<00:05:43.840> one<00:05:44.080> of<00:05:44.170> our<00:05:44.290> number<00:05:44.410> one

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
because that's one of our number one

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.230 
because that's one of our number one
requirements<00:05:45.190> of<00:05:45.340> what<00:05:45.670> they<00:05:45.790> have<00:05:45.910> to<00:05:46.060> do<00:05:46.210> to

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
requirements of what they have to do to

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.010 
requirements of what they have to do to
fit<00:05:46.660> clubz<00:05:46.900> properly<00:05:47.380> so<00:05:48.240> with<00:05:49.240> that<00:05:49.360> I<00:05:49.420> think

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
fit clubz properly so with that I think

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.590 
fit clubz properly so with that I think
we've<00:05:50.170> answered<00:05:50.320> both<00:05:50.650> of<00:05:50.830> your<00:05:50.920> questions

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:51.600 
we've answered both of your questions

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.240 
we've answered both of your questions
again<00:05:52.600> moving<00:05:53.440> the<00:05:53.530> ball<00:05:53.680> playing<00:05:53.980> the<00:05:54.100> ball

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:54.250 
again moving the ball playing the ball

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:56.970 
again moving the ball playing the ball
in<00:05:54.280> one<00:05:54.520> place<00:05:54.760> sounds<00:05:55.150> good<00:05:55.360> but<00:05:55.930> because<00:05:56.890> you

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:56.980 
in one place sounds good but because you

00:05:56.980 --> 00:05:59.190 
in one place sounds good but because you
say<00:05:57.100> all<00:05:57.220> I<00:05:57.250> do<00:05:57.490> is<00:05:57.520> live<00:05:57.760> in<00:05:57.790> one<00:05:57.970> position<00:05:58.200> yes

00:05:59.190 --> 00:05:59.200 
say all I do is live in one position yes

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.890 
say all I do is live in one position yes
but<00:05:59.980> that<00:06:00.190> on<00:06:00.430> the<00:06:00.790> other<00:06:00.940> side<00:06:01.180> it<00:06:01.420> leads<00:06:01.750> you

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
but that on the other side it leads you

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:04.260 
but that on the other side it leads you
much<00:06:02.230> more<00:06:02.650> susceptible<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.790> moving<00:06:04.120> too<00:06:04.240> much

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
much more susceptible to moving too much

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:06.420 
much more susceptible to moving too much
in<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:05.020> swing<00:06:05.290> and<00:06:05.500> that's<00:06:05.740> the<00:06:05.980> worst<00:06:06.160> of<00:06:06.280> it

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:06.430 
in the swing and that's the worst of it

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:07.800 
in the swing and that's the worst of it
all<00:06:06.520> because<00:06:06.700> if<00:06:07.060> you're<00:06:07.240> moving<00:06:07.600> and<00:06:07.750> the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
all because if you're moving and the

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:09.660 
all because if you're moving and the
ball<00:06:07.840> is<00:06:08.020> and<00:06:08.410> then<00:06:08.740> you're<00:06:09.190> getting<00:06:09.490> to<00:06:09.580> the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:09.670 
ball is and then you're getting to the

00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:12.120 
ball is and then you're getting to the
ball<00:06:09.850> will<00:06:10.060> be<00:06:10.180> different<00:06:10.540> with<00:06:10.930> most<00:06:11.860> of<00:06:11.980> your

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.130 
ball will be different with most of your

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:13.200 
ball will be different with most of your
swings<00:06:12.430> and<00:06:12.700> that's<00:06:12.820> going<00:06:13.000> to<00:06:13.060> cause

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
swings and that's going to cause

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.390 
swings and that's going to cause
problems<00:06:13.660> and<00:06:13.720> hitting<00:06:13.960> it<00:06:14.050> solid

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:14.400 
problems and hitting it solid

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.770 
problems and hitting it solid
consistently<00:06:15.400> and<00:06:15.580> and<00:06:16.060> therefore<00:06:16.510> hitting

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
consistently and and therefore hitting

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.960 
consistently and and therefore hitting
it<00:06:16.900> straight<00:06:17.140> and<00:06:17.530> under<00:06:18.430> control<00:06:18.730> where<00:06:18.880> you

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:18.970 
it straight and under control where you

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.270 
it straight and under control where you
want<00:06:19.150> it<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.330> go<00:06:19.450> so<00:06:19.680> stay<00:06:20.680> from<00:06:20.920> the<00:06:21.040> middle

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:21.280 
want it to go so stay from the middle

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:22.680 
want it to go so stay from the middle
position<00:06:21.670> and<00:06:21.850> move<00:06:22.330> it<00:06:22.450> a<00:06:22.480> little<00:06:22.510> forward
