00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
it's just it's cheaper this way we don't

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.060 
it's just it's cheaper this way we don't
have<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.520> waste<00:00:35.700> steak<00:00:36.030> it's<00:00:37.020> late<00:00:37.350> by<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.800> way

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
you can only start a video so no dogs to

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.510 
you can only start a video so no dogs to
hurt<00:00:42.030> that's<00:00:42.390> step<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:43.070> of<00:00:44.070> course<00:00:44.340> you<00:00:44.460> need

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
hurt that's step one of course you need

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
hurt that's step one of course you need
a<00:00:44.610> piece<00:00:44.760> of<00:00:44.789> bread<00:00:45.120> which<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.170> already<00:00:46.260> have<00:00:46.379> up

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
a piece of bread which I already have up

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.470 
a piece of bread which I already have up
so<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.010> can<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.250> get<00:00:47.430> on<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.760> I<00:00:48.030> would

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
so we can just get on to it I would

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.110 
so we can just get on to it I would
suggest<00:00:48.840> an<00:00:49.200> end<00:00:49.410> piece<00:00:49.649> because<00:00:50.550> piece

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.130 

because<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.239> looks<00:00:54.420> more<00:00:54.480> like<00:00:54.750> steak<00:00:54.960> it's

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
because it looks more like steak it's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.590 
because it looks more like steak it's
darker<00:00:55.590> like<00:00:56.370> I<00:00:56.489> said<00:00:56.670> before<00:00:56.820> I<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.300> it's

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600

before I suggest kind of a used one that
way<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.780> kind<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.259> looks<00:02:00.710> like<00:02:00.830> it's<00:02:01.130> actually

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
way it kind of looks like it's actually

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.109 
way it kind of looks like it's actually
a<00:02:01.759> drill<00:02:02.090> now<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:02.929> point<00:02:03.439> of<00:02:03.530> this<00:02:03.740> is<00:02:04.119> it

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
a drill now the point of this is it

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:06.580 
a drill now the point of this is it
doesn't<00:02:05.390> really<00:02:05.570> matter<00:02:05.840> how<00:02:06.079> you<00:02:06.110> like<00:02:06.409> you

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
doesn't really matter how you like you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.990
