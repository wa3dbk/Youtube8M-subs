00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:14.730
 I most want to change over time was the 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:17.730
 strong but it's the right one 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.449
 after that holiday for the future 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.430
 then it is I spent a year I 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.109
 speak is that I know nothing about 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.230
 signed 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:33.750
 now I kind of do 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:37.559
 So know eva is the advance is a late one. 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.460
 movies and got in touch with me because 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.500
 I have a dubbing studio right? 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.460
 and more is not defined at all because 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.370
 also exist is looking for others 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.829
 studios is that there will be enough 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:59.799
 but it seems it seems that 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.530
 they will squid because there was this contact 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:05.199
 he knew they posted on facebook you in 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:08.140
 somewhere and explain why not 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.399
 published a notice that they were 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.770
 wired is one thing is do not know me 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.270
 asked me if I came from Brazil almost 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.299
 other studios 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:21.460
 I said that depending on the studio 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:24.610
 because there are studies that I do not work 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.360
 so for example if you go to the studio 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.360
 where from the claroronaldo the dragon will fall 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.119
 for football is a place of work 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.909
 So I liked the government in 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.159
 Expectation for me to go teachers 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.190
 nice that gives very dirty 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:44.470
 even because I guarantee them that I 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.359
 I could keep 100% of the cast 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:52.000
 original the dragon ball z 

00:01:46.359 --> 00:02:00.630
 I think the military logic copom 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.630
 must have something in common
