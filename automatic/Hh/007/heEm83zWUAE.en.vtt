00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:04.080
 exactly on Friday that such euros 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.460
 well the face selection many say 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.950
 who has ensured impossible company 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.890
 some others and we see mexico 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.560
 qualifying the probe yes 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:19.020
 I gave him two points I think that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.350
 I return without winning I give him four and 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.350
 pass 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.520
 with four confederations 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.640
 Mexico 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.260
 america complicated 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.170
 it's not complicated now it's very 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.640
 complicated and you can be split 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.230
 Brazil and it can be split 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.810
 champion and you can follow them to croatia 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.520
 I believe that Mexico has the best 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.280
 acted is when he has played with 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.280
 teams of better level I believe it 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.770
 but the Mexican national team 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:41.479
 I think that I think it's winning 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:43.119
 Brazil and Ghana is camerÃºn 78 is killed 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:46.400
 with croatia 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:49.430
 Brazil is Brazil is lost with Brazil and 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.500
 it kills with kroes and mexico happens like this is 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.780
 this is how you are managing as you foresee 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
 70 and of course I think he does not win a 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.540
 party I think that you are losing the 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.540
 three parties mexico 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.050
 the Croatian national team the two parties 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.610
 against iceland either and the bears 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.740
 mexico the eliminator 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.740
 [Applause]
