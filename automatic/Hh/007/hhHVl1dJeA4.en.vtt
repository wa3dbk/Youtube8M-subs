psycho duck and I am here with an
aesthetic<00:00:06.450> map<00:00:06.750> feature<00:00:07.109> which<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.160> something

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
aesthetic map feature which is something

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.209 
aesthetic map feature which is something
we<00:00:08.940> have<00:00:09.090> not<00:00:09.389> done<00:00:09.750> in<00:00:09.929> quite<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.440> while<00:00:10.889> and

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
we have not done in quite a while and

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:13.190 
we have not done in quite a while and
there's<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.240> few<00:00:12.480> reasons<00:00:12.540> for<00:00:12.900> that<00:00:13.139> but

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
there's a few reasons for that but

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.799 
there's a few reasons for that but
hopefully<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.009> gonna<00:00:14.070> get<00:00:14.370> back<00:00:15.299> into<00:00:15.570> them

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
hopefully we're gonna get back into them

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:16.340 
hopefully we're gonna get back into them
soon

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
soon

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.859 
soon
this<00:00:16.890> is<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.580> covenant<00:00:17.850> cruiser<00:00:18.270> Magna<00:00:18.750> was

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
this is a covenant cruiser Magna was

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.400 
this is a covenant cruiser Magna was
created<00:00:19.199> by<00:00:19.320> sia<00:00:19.650> Pieria<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.660> believe<00:00:22.380> that

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
created by sia Pieria and I believe that

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.179 
created by sia Pieria and I believe that
the<00:00:23.100> last<00:00:23.810> aesthetic<00:00:24.810> Cruiser<00:00:25.080> or<00:00:25.350> aesthetic

map<00:00:26.820> we<00:00:27.390> featured<00:00:27.750> was<00:00:27.990> another<00:00:28.710> covenant

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
map we featured was another covenant

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.970 
map we featured was another covenant
cruiser<00:00:29.369> so<00:00:30.150> sorry<00:00:31.019> for<00:00:31.230> the<00:00:31.289> repetition<00:00:31.679> but

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
cruiser so sorry for the repetition but

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.290 
cruiser so sorry for the repetition but
it's<00:00:32.130> been<00:00:32.340> so<00:00:32.579> long<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.540> this<00:00:33.750> map<00:00:34.050> is

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
it's been so long and this map is

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.639 
it's been so long and this map is
amazing<00:00:36.620> basically<00:00:37.620> this<00:00:38.280> map<00:00:38.579> is<00:00:39.649> humongous

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
amazing basically this map is humongous

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.030 
amazing basically this map is humongous
if<00:00:40.860> you've<00:00:41.160> seen<00:00:41.550> Spaceballs<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:43.040> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
if you've seen Spaceballs and you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.860 
if you've seen Spaceballs and you
remember<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.579> scene<00:00:44.820> where<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.360> spaceball

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
remember the scene where the spaceball

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.959 
remember the scene where the spaceball
one<00:00:45.899> is<00:00:46.289> flying<00:00:46.649> across<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> screen<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.850> it

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
one is flying across the screen and it

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.540 
one is flying across the screen and it
takes<00:00:48.210> like<00:00:48.480> two<00:00:49.350> minutes<00:00:49.559> to<00:00:50.219> cross<00:00:50.399> the

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
takes like two minutes to cross the

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.430 
takes like two minutes to cross the
screen<00:00:50.820> because<00:00:51.000> a<00:00:51.030> ship<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.510> big<00:00:51.750> that's

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
screen because a ship so big that's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.510 
screen because a ship so big that's
pretty<00:00:53.280> much<00:00:53.460> what's<00:00:53.760> going<00:00:54.030> on<00:00:54.210> here<00:00:55.250> out<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
pretty much what's going on here out of

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.450 
pretty much what's going on here out of
curiosity<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:57.300> took<00:00:57.600> a<00:00:57.629> measurement<00:00:58.079> and<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
curiosity I took a measurement and this

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.090 
curiosity I took a measurement and this
map<00:01:00.140> the<00:01:01.140> ship<00:01:01.410> is<00:01:02.329> 115<00:01:03.359> it's<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:03.960> 114<00:01:04.769> point

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
map the ship is 115 it's like 114 point

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.679 
map the ship is 115 it's like 114 point
8<00:01:05.369> units<00:01:06.299> long<00:01:06.420> so<00:01:07.010> I<00:01:08.010> went<00:01:08.400> over<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.850> Ragnarok

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
8 units long so I went over to Ragnarok

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.899 
8 units long so I went over to Ragnarok
and<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.020> took<00:01:10.229> a<00:01:10.290> measurement<00:01:10.560> there<00:01:10.890> and<00:01:11.130> it<00:01:11.729> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
and I took a measurement there and it is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.780 
and I took a measurement there and it is
like<00:01:13.130> 121<00:01:14.130> units<00:01:14.939> long<00:01:15.119> so<00:01:15.680> this<00:01:16.680> map<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:16.890> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
like 121 units long so this map is the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.109 
like 121 units long so this map is the
ship<00:01:18.030> is<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> size<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.869> Valhalla<00:01:19.320> it's<00:01:20.119> huge

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
ship is the size of Valhalla it's huge

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.749 
ship is the size of Valhalla it's huge
and<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:22.170> attention<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.680> detail<00:01:23.159> is<00:01:23.430> really

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
and the attention to detail is really

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.880 
and the attention to detail is really
impressive<00:01:24.479> so<00:01:24.689> on

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
impressive so on

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
impressive so on
you<00:01:26.430> know<00:01:26.549> like<00:01:27.030> covenant<00:01:27.479> architecture<00:01:28.049> in

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
you know like covenant architecture in

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.440 
you know like covenant architecture in
general<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.560> very<00:01:28.770> curvy<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.520> it's<00:01:30.210> something

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
general is very curvy and it's something

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.130 
general is very curvy and it's something
that<00:01:30.710> to<00:01:31.710> create<00:01:32.040> with<00:01:32.250> Forge<00:01:32.579> pieces<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.329> you

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
that to create with Forge pieces is you

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
that to create with Forge pieces is you
know<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.470> like<00:01:34.650> our<00:01:34.829> Forge<00:01:35.400> objects<00:01:35.880> just

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
know that like our Forge objects just

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.749 
know that like our Forge objects just
don't<00:01:36.540> lend<00:01:36.900> themselves<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.770> that<00:01:38.250> kind<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
don't lend themselves to that kind of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.020 
don't lend themselves to that kind of
architecture<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.630> maybe<00:01:40.500> because<00:01:41.009> he<00:01:41.880> was

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
architecture but maybe because he was

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.660 
architecture but maybe because he was
working<00:01:42.180> on<00:01:42.420> such<00:01:42.659> a<00:01:42.689> large<00:01:42.899> scale<00:01:43.490> probably<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
working on such a large scale probably a

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.580 
working on such a large scale probably a
combination<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.659> just<00:01:45.960> knowing

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
combination of that and just knowing

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:47.840 
combination of that and just knowing
what<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:46.979> doing

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
what he is doing

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.800 
what he is doing
South<00:01:48.390> Korea<00:01:48.780> has<00:01:49.220> made<00:01:50.220> like<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.329> curves<00:01:51.630> on

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
South Korea has made like the curves on

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.580 
South Korea has made like the curves on
this<00:01:51.960> map<00:01:52.140> are<00:01:52.409> incredible<00:01:53.189> but<00:01:53.930> Sonic<00:01:54.930> that's

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
this map are incredible but Sonic that's

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.830 
this map are incredible but Sonic that's
kind<00:01:55.829> of<00:01:55.860> weird<00:01:56.070> I'm<00:01:56.670> feel<00:01:57.299> like<00:01:57.329> I'm<00:01:57.509> talking

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
kind of weird I'm feel like I'm talking

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:58.760 
kind of weird I'm feel like I'm talking
about<00:01:57.869> it<00:01:58.110> woman<00:01:58.229> OH

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
about it woman OH

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.310 
about it woman OH
but<00:02:00.380> anyways<00:02:01.380> like<00:02:02.219> just<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:03.320> architecture

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
but anyways like just the architecture

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.850 
but anyways like just the architecture
the<00:02:04.799> geometry<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.700> this<00:02:06.390> ship<00:02:06.750> is<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.290> really

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
the geometry on this ship is just really

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.040 
the geometry on this ship is just really
really<00:02:08.399> impressive<00:02:08.910> because<00:02:09.239> it's<00:02:09.420> so<00:02:09.750> big

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
really impressive because it's so big

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.530 
really impressive because it's so big
but<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.739> got<00:02:10.890> so<00:02:11.190> much<00:02:11.340> detail<00:02:11.879> I<00:02:11.910> mean<00:02:12.090> it

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
but it's got so much detail I mean it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.770 
but it's got so much detail I mean it
like<00:02:13.219> dead-on<00:02:14.219> accurate<00:02:14.549> -<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.480> know<00:02:15.569> how

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
like dead-on accurate - you know how

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.149 
like dead-on accurate - you know how
these<00:02:15.900> things<00:02:16.140> look<00:02:16.370> in-game<00:02:18.560> it's<00:02:19.560> just<00:02:19.799> so

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
these things look in-game it's just so
