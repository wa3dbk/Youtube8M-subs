00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the left side of the bike so as you can

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.680 
the left side of the bike so as you can
see<00:00:10.800> this<00:00:11.040> is<00:00:11.219> the<00:00:11.309> left<00:00:11.460> side<00:00:11.519> of<00:00:11.639> the<00:00:11.790> bike<00:00:11.969> we

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
see this is the left side of the bike we

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.890 
see this is the left side of the bike we
have<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:13.769> gear<00:00:14.400> shifter<00:00:14.849> here<00:00:15.210> on<00:00:15.420> the<00:00:15.630> foot

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
have the gear shifter here on the foot

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.260 
have the gear shifter here on the foot
side<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:17.279> little<00:00:17.609> thing<00:00:17.760> right<00:00:17.880> in<00:00:18.029> front<00:00:18.180> of

side this little thing right in front of
the<00:00:18.330> foot<00:00:18.510> peg<00:00:19.070> the<00:00:20.070> clutch<00:00:20.550> is<00:00:20.910> up<00:00:21.510> here<00:00:22.050> on

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:22.550 
the foot peg the clutch is up here on

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.410 
the foot peg the clutch is up here on
the<00:00:23.550> handlebar

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the handlebar

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.470 
the handlebar
it's<00:00:25.050> the<00:00:25.289> clutch<00:00:25.980> lever<00:00:26.310> again<00:00:27.060> it's<00:00:27.269> on<00:00:27.390> the

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
it's the clutch lever again it's on the

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.810 
it's the clutch lever again it's on the
left<00:00:27.660> side<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.050> bike<00:00:28.230> so<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.490> you're<00:00:29.670> ever

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
left side of the bike so if you're ever

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.510 
left side of the bike so if you're ever
wondering<00:00:30.150> it's<00:00:30.720> easier<00:00:30.990> to<00:00:31.080> sort<00:00:31.320> out<00:00:31.520> that

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
wondering it's easier to sort out that

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.650 
wondering it's easier to sort out that
the<00:00:33.059> gear<00:00:33.780> shifting<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.649> anything<00:00:35.660> involved

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
the gear shifting and anything involved

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.600 
the gear shifting and anything involved
with<00:00:36.840> shifting<00:00:37.320> gears<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.890> on<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.340> left<00:00:38.489> side

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
with shifting gears is on the left side

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.110 
with shifting gears is on the left side
of<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.850> bike<00:00:39.079> with<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> being<00:00:40.440> said<00:00:41.120> next

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
of the bike with that being said next

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.540 
of the bike with that being said next
thing<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> note<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.809> some<00:00:43.649> bikes<00:00:43.890> like<00:00:44.370> down

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
thing to note is some bikes like down

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.860 
thing to note is some bikes like down
here<00:00:44.910> which<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.239> probably<00:00:45.360> can't<00:00:45.600> see<00:00:45.660> on<00:00:45.840> the

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
here which you probably can't see on the

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
be in neutral which is right now it'll

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.740 
be in neutral which is right now it'll
be<00:00:57.920> pushing<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.010> down<00:00:59.190> first<00:00:59.699> gear<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.090> it'll

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
be pushing it down first gear and it'll

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.009 
be pushing it down first gear and it'll
reset<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.670> then<00:01:02.670> pulling<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.390> from<00:01:03.899> the

gear sixth year depending on how many

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.499 
gear sixth year depending on how many
gears<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.290> five<00:01:13.680> or<00:01:13.950> six<00:01:14.240> most<00:01:15.240> bikes

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
gears you have five or six most bikes

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.840 
gears you have five or six most bikes
now<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.930> six<00:01:16.170> gears<00:01:16.380> and<00:01:17.070> then<00:01:17.400> if<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> want

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
now have six gears and then if you want

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.640 
now have six gears and then if you want
to<00:01:17.909> come<00:01:18.060> back<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.450> same<00:01:18.900> concept<00:01:19.140> you're

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
to come back down same concept you're

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.140 
to come back down same concept you're
pushing<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.130> this<00:01:20.310> way<00:01:20.460> counting<00:01:20.820> back<00:01:20.939> down

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
pushing down this way counting back down

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.450 
pushing down this way counting back down
so<00:01:21.960> you'll<00:01:22.080> push<00:01:22.259> down<00:01:22.619> on<00:01:22.890> the<00:01:23.159> lever

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
so you'll push down on the lever

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.789 
so you'll push down on the lever
it'll<00:01:24.180> be<00:01:24.299> fifth<00:01:25.130> fourth<00:01:26.130> third<00:01:27.530> second<00:01:28.530> and

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it'll be fifth fourth third second and

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.060 
it'll be fifth fourth third second and
here's<00:01:29.729> here<00:01:30.299> is<00:01:30.479> where<00:01:31.110> neutral<00:01:31.530> sits<00:01:31.860> in

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
here's here is where neutral sits in

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.359 
here's here is where neutral sits in
between<00:01:32.549> first<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.780> second<00:01:34.079> gear<00:01:34.250> so<00:01:35.250> if

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
between first and the second gear so if

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.640 
between first and the second gear so if
you're<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.579> second<00:01:35.939> right<00:01:36.060> now<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.650> you

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
you're in second right now and you

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.399 
you're in second right now and you
lightly<00:01:38.070> push<00:01:38.909> it<00:01:39.030> down<00:01:39.180> not<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> full<00:01:40.049> press

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
lightly push it down not a full press

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.249 
lightly push it down not a full press
but<00:01:41.369> just<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.579> light<00:01:41.700> push<00:01:41.960> you'll<00:01:42.960> most<00:01:43.200> likely

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
but just a light push you'll most likely

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.649 
but just a light push you'll most likely
be<00:01:43.500> in<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> new<00:01:43.829> trough<00:01:44.100> that<00:01:44.299> most<00:01:45.299> clusters

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
be in a new trough that most clusters

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.219 
be in a new trough that most clusters
have<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:45.930> neutral<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.649> n<00:01:47.509> light<00:01:48.509> up<00:01:48.689> when

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
have a neutral and n light up when

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.410 
have a neutral and n light up when
you're<00:01:49.409> neutral<00:01:49.740> so<00:01:50.520> like<00:01:50.700> press<00:01:50.939> you'll<00:01:51.270> be<00:01:51.390> a

something<00:04:16.290> third<00:04:16.739> gear<00:04:17.070> okay<00:04:17.310> all<00:04:17.400> the<00:04:17.520> bikes

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
something third gear okay all the bikes

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:18.800 
something third gear okay all the bikes
you<00:04:17.730> guys<00:04:17.910> work<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.270> I<00:04:18.330> can<00:04:18.480> probably<00:04:18.630> go<00:04:18.780> a

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
you guys work so I can probably go a

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.590 
you guys work so I can probably go a
little<00:04:18.989> higher<00:04:19.200> at<00:04:19.980> lower<00:04:20.190> gears<00:04:20.520> but<00:04:21.480> that's

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
little higher at lower gears but that's

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.260 
little higher at lower gears but that's
pretty<00:04:21.780> much<00:04:21.870> it<00:04:22.140> just<00:04:22.440> make<00:04:22.620> sure<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:23.270> know

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
pretty much it just make sure I know

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.750 
pretty much it just make sure I know
your<00:04:24.480> gears<00:04:24.780> you<00:04:25.230> practice<00:04:25.740> and<00:04:26.010> you<00:04:26.490> know<00:04:26.610> the

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:26.760 
your gears you practice and you know the

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:28.640 
your gears you practice and you know the
feel<00:04:26.970> of<00:04:27.000> where<00:04:27.270> neutral<00:04:27.630> is<00:04:27.840> right<00:04:28.470> here

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
feel of where neutral is right here

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.500 
feel of where neutral is right here
neutral<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.250> little<00:04:29.280> play<00:04:29.670> that's<00:04:30.300> in<00:04:30.420> between

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
neutral a little play that's in between

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.240 
neutral a little play that's in between
first<00:04:30.870> and<00:04:31.020> second<00:04:32.570> and<00:04:33.590> just<00:04:34.590> pretty<00:04:34.920> much<00:04:35.070> it

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
first and second and just pretty much it

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.070 
first and second and just pretty much it
for<00:04:35.430> gear<00:04:35.730> shifting<00:04:36.120> pretty<00:04:36.660> simple<00:04:36.960> concept

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
for gear shifting pretty simple concept

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.440 
for gear shifting pretty simple concept
actually
