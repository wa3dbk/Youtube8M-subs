 Chita when watching this match 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.010
 I wanted the key music and enjoy 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.450
 team assortment 23 match was very 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.730
 quickly and calmly guys 23 in dispute 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:53.980
 performed very aggressive and 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.340
 quality equal looking side was 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.750
 it can be seen that the board of wines were weaker at home 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.960
 their rivals 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.770
 this match turned out for guys so to speak 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 strength and error test 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:05.660
 it says there is the main thing who can handle 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.660
 then another 16 6 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.430

 dangerous team called itar tass 11 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.170
 out of 23 thousand the match turned out to be interesting and if 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.810
 the first three rounds were very fast and 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.450
 calmly condemned went big 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.120
 problems in a 20 year old situation came down 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.980
 basement 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.450
 they have already begun to decide against 23 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.530
 their rivals after big floor got 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.030
 push the opponent and the first 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.040
 half ended 1 series not in favor 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.210
 third parties but in the second everything was on 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.360
 their places guys showed 20 kilos 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.910
 very interesting action and brought 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.650
 game to the bitter end 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.650

 Kirov card claims to start up 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.910
 was not as interesting as in the previous one 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.710
 match teams fathers did not show 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.430
 decent resistance 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.929
 team 23 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:09.530
 interface turn start 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:10.929
 attack simply overwhelmed 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.670
 rival talk about any 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.079
 tactical action would be inappropriate so 

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.950
 team 23 and was not required and 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.980
 show if tomorrow allows 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.989
 beat your opponent why not guys 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:22.870
 fired exactly as they called cyc 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.349
 rivals and such a score of 16 5 and ahead 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.349
 final match 

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:54.409
 finals included in the osago steel team fas and 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.859
 hilton was able to continue his series of victories that 

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.299
 Concerning the final, we can only say 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:00.159
 one matches of such teams always 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:01.779
 interesting game was going on 

00:03:01.779 --> 00:03:03.839
 pictures of the rebels are initially late so 

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:06.040
 began to dominate the game and show 3d 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.370
 if for yourself from library japanese 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.500
 but something made them change the pace of prim and 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.200
 they stopped pushing an opponent 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.370
 fuel feed rounds hit herself 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.110
 patterns and therefore positional play 

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.329
 became the shock of march prayers 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.370
 by order of Stalin 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:20.700
 slightly dilute the slow dance 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.790
 quick rounds would go too already 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.590
 fifty kilometers 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:26.560
 the benefits of it are not as elegant as 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.419
 wanted to 

00:03:27.419 --> 00:03:29.519
 but if the team did not care 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.039
 higher opponent 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:33.429
 in general, the march was very interesting 

00:03:33.429 --> 00:03:35.849
 who got 16 13 ndl warmer becomes 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:38.349
 the winner in with his alanya is not specified 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:39.649
 number 35 

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:42.649
 however championship at number 36 

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:53.789
 at the eighth finals stood out very bright 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:54.730
 beautiful game 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.330
 oddly enough this match can be called 

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.200
 one of the most interesting and return 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:58.929
 the tournament 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:00.479
 so late were the chances of winning the tournament 

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:03.209
 regain the title of the best team of the tournament but 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.889
 Alas, this did not happen 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.889
 match will pass the day the transport failed 

00:04:06.889 --> 00:04:09.829
 snatch victory losing three 14 16 them 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.269
 there turn is very good 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:12.369
 looked 

00:04:12.369 --> 00:04:14.289
 and shows excellent shooting and in this 

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:16.120
 clearly played out a round of mistakes were 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.430
 as the bill speaks for itself but not 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.029
 less guy did not miss victory in 

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:21.539
 group and getting into one fourth 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:24.539
 finals 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.430
 similar situation repeated situation 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.669
 like with team 23 in any way 

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:34.520
 tactical actions we did not see but 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:36.150
 excellent shooting was very much 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.400
 team in mintrans very clearly thought 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.610
 rivals and arson made by 2 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.180
 up to 3 unanswered minuses well and then for 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.580
 the score is clean but took advantage 

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.130
 round their rivals predator were able to take 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.919
 only 10 rounds hall restaurants but this 

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:52.840
 little to win 16 10 match result and intrans 

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:55.840
 tournament semi final 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:16.889
 in the second reigning champion and team 20 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:18.229
 years should have defended his title 

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.249
 cards have not deteriorated and you will 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:21.029
 teams 

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:23.209
 as we see impose a fight in the Ministry of Transport in 

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:25.019
 These and did not work their resistance 

00:05:25.019 --> 00:05:27.089
 only made four rounds for the whole 

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.979
 map to complete this match review 

00:05:28.979 --> 00:05:30.819
 Excellent draw of the rounds to look for 

00:05:30.819 --> 00:05:32.709
 long again command filter 

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.429
 underlines the importance of assessing the situation 

00:05:34.429 --> 00:05:36.699
 what can be done spend on order or 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:39.699
 other reasons 

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:06.339
 final inferno card 

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:08.149
 The second finalist was the TEC team 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:10.179
 the ministry team won with some problems 

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:11.339
 final 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:13.099
 although during the match domination went 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:15.499
 it is from the intrans but guys don't care 

00:06:15.499 --> 00:06:17.399
 made a series of mistakes that led to 

00:06:17.399 --> 00:06:19.589
 dealing as many as 13 rounds 

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.679
 nevertheless could not win the game but after 

00:06:21.679 --> 00:06:23.609
 behind him and the tournament itself congratulations and 

00:06:23.609 --> 00:06:25.349
