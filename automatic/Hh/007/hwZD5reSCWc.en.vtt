00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.320 
day but anyways I give a lot of hate to
pretty<00:00:20.100> much<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.689> SMGs<00:00:21.689> except<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.470> ump45

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:23.330 
pretty much all SMGs except the ump45

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.660 
pretty much all SMGs except the ump45
and<00:00:24.330> what<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.689> to<00:00:24.779> say<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.740> mp5k<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
and what I want to say is the mp5k is

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.689 
and what I want to say is the mp5k is
probably<00:00:27.029> better<00:00:27.240> at<00:00:27.449> close<00:00:27.689> range<00:00:28.080> than<00:00:28.590> the

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
probably better at close range than the

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.740 
probably better at close range than the
UMP<00:00:30.170> reason<00:00:31.170> why<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.380> because<00:00:31.529> the<00:00:32.570> the<00:00:33.570> mouth

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
UMP reason why is because the the mouth

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.900 
UMP reason why is because the the mouth
it<00:00:34.200> takes<00:00:34.469> off<00:00:34.620> more<00:00:34.800> damage<00:00:35.190> and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.430> fire

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
it takes off more damage and the fire

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.229 
it takes off more damage and the fire
rages<00:00:36.270> just<00:00:36.480> bananas<00:00:36.840> man<00:00:37.230> it's<00:00:37.770> crazy<00:00:38.030> and<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.520 
rages just bananas man it's crazy and I
noticed<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.629> more<00:00:39.780> i<00:00:39.809> use<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.500> more

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
noticed the more i use it the more

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.819 
noticed the more i use it the more
comfortable<00:00:40.980> i<00:00:41.190> become<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:42.210> more<00:00:42.829> confident
