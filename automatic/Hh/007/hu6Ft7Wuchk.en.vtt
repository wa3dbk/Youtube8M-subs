00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:30.880 
to straighten it by accident because

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.390 
to straighten it by accident because
that<00:04:31.120> would<00:04:31.270> be<00:04:31.389> bad<00:04:31.570> but<00:04:32.229> this<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:32.860> perfect

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
that would be bad but this is perfect

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:33.870

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:35.680 
so you can see the steam comes out that

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.280 
so you can see the steam comes out that
there's<00:04:35.830> no<00:04:35.979> droplets<00:04:36.490> of<00:04:36.610> water<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.750> if<00:04:38.050> I

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
there's no droplets of water but if I

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:39.810 
there's no droplets of water but if I
hold<00:04:38.500> it<00:04:38.620> up<00:04:38.680> against<00:04:38.949> my<00:04:39.040> hand<00:04:39.340> for<00:04:39.580> a<00:04:39.610> while

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:39.820 
hold it up against my hand for a while

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.060 
hold it up against my hand for a while
you<00:04:40.780> can<00:04:40.900> absolutely<00:04:41.229> see<00:04:41.560> how<00:04:41.710> water's

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
you can absolutely see how water's

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.219 
you can absolutely see how water's
forming<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:43.090> that's<00:04:43.270> good<00:04:43.570> it's<00:04:43.840> everything

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
forming so that's good it's everything

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.560 
forming so that's good it's everything
that<00:04:44.440> these<00:04:44.710> expensive<00:04:45.340> steamers<00:04:45.729> have<00:04:45.970> but

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
that these expensive steamers have but

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.990 
that these expensive steamers have but
without<00:04:46.840> the<00:04:46.990> price<00:04:47.199> tag<00:04:47.580> so<00:04:48.580> there<00:04:48.699> you<00:04:48.820> go

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
without the price tag so there you go

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.580

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
one of the other handheld steamers and

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:12.570 
one of the other handheld steamers and
it's<00:05:10.990> much<00:05:11.199> like<00:05:11.380> this<00:05:11.560> method<00:05:11.800> so<00:05:12.190> I<00:05:12.220> figure

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
it's much like this method so I figure

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.760 
it's much like this method so I figure
what's<00:05:12.760> the<00:05:12.850> difference<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:14.440> I<00:05:14.590> know<00:05:14.650> I

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:14.770 
what's the difference and I know I

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.650 
what's the difference and I know I
didn't<00:05:15.070> want<00:05:15.190> to<00:05:15.280> pay<00:05:15.400> the<00:05:15.520> big<00:05:15.639> price<00:05:15.850> tag<00:05:16.090> and

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
didn't want to pay the big price tag and

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.629 
didn't want to pay the big price tag and
I<00:05:16.780> don't<00:05:16.900> know<00:05:16.960> if<00:05:17.050> you<00:05:17.110> can<00:05:17.260> tell<00:05:17.470> already<00:05:17.639> but

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:18.639 
I don't know if you can tell already but

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:20.250 
I don't know if you can tell already but
see<00:05:18.820> how<00:05:18.910> my<00:05:19.060> hair<00:05:19.240> starting<00:05:19.690> to<00:05:19.810> form<00:05:20.050> into

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:20.260 
see how my hair starting to form into

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:23.339 
see how my hair starting to form into
normal<00:05:20.500> curls<00:05:21.180> and<00:05:22.180> I<00:05:22.810> don't<00:05:22.990> know<00:05:23.080> if<00:05:23.169> you<00:05:23.229> can

00:05:23.339 --> 00:05:23.349 
normal curls and I don't know if you can

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:25.440 
normal curls and I don't know if you can
feel<00:05:23.740> if<00:05:23.979> you<00:05:24.070> can<00:05:24.220> obviously<00:05:24.849> you<00:05:25.030> can't<00:05:25.240> feel

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
feel if you can obviously you can't feel

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.350 
feel if you can obviously you can't feel
it<00:05:25.479> but<00:05:25.870> maybe<00:05:26.020> you<00:05:26.289> can<00:05:26.440> see<00:05:26.740> the<00:05:26.860> difference

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
it but maybe you can see the difference

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:31.469 
it but maybe you can see the difference
my<00:05:28.360> hair<00:05:28.630> it<00:05:28.870> feels<00:05:29.110> so<00:05:29.530> soft<00:05:30.310> because<00:05:31.300> all

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
my hair it feels so soft because all

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:35.100 
my hair it feels so soft because all
that<00:05:31.660> moisture<00:05:31.840> is<00:05:32.110> going<00:05:32.260> right<00:05:32.620> into<00:05:32.800> it<00:05:34.110> and

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:35.110 
that moisture is going right into it and

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:36.719 
that moisture is going right into it and
obviously<00:05:35.800> there's<00:05:35.979> no<00:05:36.070> heat<00:05:36.250> damage<00:05:36.580> because

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
obviously there's no heat damage because

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:40.140 
obviously there's no heat damage because
my<00:05:36.789> hair<00:05:36.970> is<00:05:37.030> probably<00:05:37.210> right<00:05:37.450> up<00:05:38.970> but<00:05:39.970> that's

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:40.150 
my hair is probably right up but that's

00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:42.690 
my hair is probably right up but that's

shed hairs but without causing super

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:09.089 
shed hairs but without causing super
shrinkage<00:06:07.960> like<00:06:08.199> if<00:06:08.349> you<00:06:08.440> get<00:06:08.560> your<00:06:08.710> hair<00:06:08.889> wet

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
because then of course we'll end up with

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:12.300 
because then of course we'll end up with
dreading<00:06:11.080> but<00:06:11.770> that's<00:06:11.919> it

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
dreading but that's it
