 Hello everyone, and today I will tell you how 

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.299
 quickly make a beautiful butterfly out 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.000
 colored paper we need 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:22.000
 square sheet of paper from which we 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:27.630
 we will fold our butterfly folded 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.230
 I made a diagonal beer from A4 format 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:43.089
 square so the diagonal is left 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:44.019
 do hand on Camille will be a good 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:50.610
 seedling 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:50.610
 and also do the line in half 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.409
 one incomplete too 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:13.470
 and here we see the whole line hovering now 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.220
 we need to fold 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.090
 we put a little triangle like this 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.560
 paper and 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:31.680
 put here in this restaurant 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:34.410
 in many figures harrigan is here 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.840
 rest and invest here so here you 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.890
 should get should get 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:48.510
 such a triangle and to her now both 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:54.380
 sides here and there we fold upside down 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:59.220
 and the second is the top then we 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:03.450
 turn the purchase down she looks 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:07.890
 we see and here we have folded 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:11.850
 see these parts and this one this one 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:15.680
 the part with the goal turns out we raise 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.260
 up up only raises more 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:23.100
 a corner like this 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:28.500
 we climb out of the limits of the small figure 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:33.630
 so here on the sides you have yet 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:38.760
 be such folds and now we fold 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:42.150
 this little corner of the figure all secured 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.610
 now unwrap the figure this one 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:49.160
 corner so that we can't see 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:52.760
 hide like that and now 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.910
 it remains only to fold the wings 

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.290
