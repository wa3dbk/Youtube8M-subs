00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
go ahead and type on your device however

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.860 
go ahead and type on your device however
personally<00:03:09.459> from<00:03:09.610> me<00:03:09.910> it<00:03:10.180> just<00:03:10.390> doesn't<00:03:10.540> raise

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
personally from me it just doesn't raise

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.140 
personally from me it just doesn't raise
it<00:03:11.110> enough<00:03:11.530> to<00:03:12.190> go<00:03:12.370> ahead<00:03:12.459> and<00:03:12.670> actually<00:03:12.820> make

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.150 
it enough to go ahead and actually make

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.559 
it enough to go ahead and actually make
it<00:03:13.330> easier

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
it easier

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.580 
it easier
but<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.469> know<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.799> was<00:03:17.069> good<00:03:17.310> thinking<00:03:17.579> and<00:03:18.590> it

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
but you know it was good thinking and it

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.289 
but you know it was good thinking and it
definitely<00:03:19.920> shows<00:03:20.430> that<00:03:20.609> more<00:03:20.790> word<00:03:20.999> put<00:03:21.269> a

00:03:21.289 --> 00:03:21.299 
definitely shows that more word put a

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:24.050 
definitely shows that more word put a
lot<00:03:21.510> of<00:03:21.540> thought<00:03:21.840> into<00:03:21.989> this<00:03:22.290> case<00:03:22.560> on<00:03:22.859> to<00:03:23.790> make

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
lot of thought into this case on to make

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.800 
lot of thought into this case on to make
it<00:03:24.650> you<00:03:25.650> know<00:03:25.739> very<00:03:25.980> unique<00:03:26.579> now<00:03:27.420> here<00:03:27.629> on<00:03:27.719> the

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
it you know very unique now here on the

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.179 
it you know very unique now here on the
bottom<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.139> can<00:03:28.260> see<00:03:28.409> that<00:03:28.739> we<00:03:28.829> have<00:03:28.859> one

00:03:29.179 --> 00:03:29.189 
bottom you can see that we have one

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:30.920 
bottom you can see that we have one
fairly<00:03:29.489> large<00:03:29.819> cut<00:03:30.120> after<00:03:30.239> the<00:03:30.450> 30-pin<00:03:30.870> dock

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
fairly large cut after the 30-pin dock

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.349 
fairly large cut after the 30-pin dock
connector<00:03:31.139> than<00:03:31.769> three<00:03:32.099> individual<00:03:32.969> cutouts

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
connector than three individual cutouts

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.020 
connector than three individual cutouts
for<00:03:33.629> the<00:03:34.019> three<00:03:34.290> speakers<00:03:34.590> this<00:03:35.489> is<00:03:35.639> very<00:03:35.849> nice

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
for the three speakers this is very nice

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.080 
for the three speakers this is very nice
because<00:03:36.299> on<00:03:37.260> the<00:03:37.409> contrary<00:03:38.010> like<00:03:38.280> with<00:03:38.519> apples

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
because on the contrary like with apples

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.140 
because on the contrary like with apples
case<00:03:39.329> they<00:03:40.079> have<00:03:40.260> several<00:03:40.769> holes<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:42.120> are

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
case they have several holes that are

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.789 
case they have several holes that are
cut<00:03:42.450> out<00:03:42.480> of<00:03:42.569> their<00:03:42.810> case<00:03:43.019> at<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.290> bottom<00:03:43.650> and

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
cut out of their case at the bottom and

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.500 
cut out of their case at the bottom and
they<00:03:44.159> don't<00:03:44.310> even<00:03:44.459> line<00:03:44.730> up<00:03:44.760> with<00:03:44.999> the<00:03:45.030> speaker

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
they don't even line up with the speaker

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.080 
they don't even line up with the speaker
so<00:03:45.689> that<00:03:45.870> tends<00:03:46.169> to<00:03:46.200> muffled<00:03:46.769> sound<00:03:47.159> however

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
so that tends to muffled sound however

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:49.909 
so that tends to muffled sound however
with<00:03:48.239> this<00:03:48.450> case<00:03:48.689> because<00:03:48.900> these<00:03:49.560> speakers

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
with this case because these speakers

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.580 
with this case because these speakers
are<00:03:49.980> completely<00:03:50.969> exposed<00:03:51.450> to<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.139> a<00:03:52.290> very

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
are completely exposed to have a very

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.050 
are completely exposed to have a very
nice<00:03:52.859> and<00:03:53.189> sharp<00:03:53.969> sound<00:03:54.239> quality<00:03:54.739> on<00:03:56.060> this

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
nice and sharp sound quality on this

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.920 
nice and sharp sound quality on this
side<00:03:57.569> you<00:03:57.959> have<00:03:58.709> a<00:03:58.739> cutout<00:03:59.219> for<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.930> volume

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
side you have a cutout for the volume

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.129 
side you have a cutout for the volume
rocker<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.590> the<00:04:02.069> rotation<00:04:03.000> log<00:04:03.180> now<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:03.840> do

rocker and the rotation log now I do

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.679 
rocker and the rotation log now I do
have<00:04:04.379> a<00:04:04.739> problem<00:04:04.980> with<00:04:05.340> this<00:04:05.519> you<00:04:06.239> can<00:04:06.389> see

00:04:06.679 --> 00:04:06.689 
have a problem with this you can see

00:04:06.689 --> 00:04:09.860 
have a problem with this you can see
that<00:04:06.719> the<00:04:07.159> plastic<00:04:08.159> comes<00:04:08.819> very<00:04:09.329> close<00:04:09.569> to<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:09.870 
that the plastic comes very close to the

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.030 
that the plastic comes very close to the
left<00:04:10.139> side<00:04:10.439> of<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:11.480> rocker<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:13.040> rotation

left side of the rocker in the rotation
lock<00:04:14.540> now<00:04:15.540> with<00:04:15.810> this<00:04:16.079> it<00:04:16.349> makes<00:04:16.769> it<00:04:16.949> pretty

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
lock now with this it makes it pretty

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.710 
lock now with this it makes it pretty
difficult<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.940> go<00:04:18.060> ahead<00:04:18.209> and<00:04:18.479> press<00:04:18.690> it

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
difficult to go ahead and press it

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.469 
difficult to go ahead and press it
straight<00:04:19.470> on<00:04:19.889> if<00:04:20.519> you're<00:04:20.759> kind<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.209> coming

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
straight on if you're kind of coming

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:23.689 
straight on if you're kind of coming
from<00:04:21.570> the<00:04:21.659> back<00:04:22.049> that<00:04:22.800> definitely<00:04:23.099> makes<00:04:23.520> it

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:23.699 
from the back that definitely makes it

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:26.450 
from the back that definitely makes it
easier<00:04:24.120> because<00:04:24.240> there<00:04:24.449> is<00:04:24.630> a<00:04:24.659> lip<00:04:25.020> here<00:04:25.460> but

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
easier because there is a lip here but

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.310 
easier because there is a lip here but
still<00:04:26.820> it<00:04:27.090> would<00:04:27.270> have<00:04:27.389> been<00:04:27.449> nicer<00:04:27.900> to<00:04:27.930> go<00:04:28.199> in

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
still it would have been nicer to go in

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.629 
still it would have been nicer to go in
and<00:04:28.440> make<00:04:28.530> it<00:04:28.710> so<00:04:28.860> it<00:04:28.919> would<00:04:29.039> have<00:04:29.130> been<00:04:29.220> easier

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
and make it so it would have been easier

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.790 
and make it so it would have been easier
to<00:04:29.699> go<00:04:29.909> ahead<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.240> go<00:04:30.330> straight<00:04:30.570> on<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.110> go

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
to go ahead and go straight on and go

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:32.600 
to go ahead and go straight on and go
ahead<00:04:31.889> and

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610 
ahead and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.550 
ahead and
use<00:04:32.789> these<00:04:33.620> on<00:04:34.620> top<00:04:35.520> we<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.569> another<00:04:37.080> cut<00:04:37.409> out

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
use these on top we have another cut out

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:39.619 
use these on top we have another cut out
and<00:04:37.740> again<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.129> same<00:04:38.340> problem<00:04:38.879> the<00:04:39.330> cutter

00:04:39.619 --> 00:04:39.629 
and again the same problem the cutter

00:04:39.629 --> 00:04:42.050 
and again the same problem the cutter
comes<00:04:40.199> very<00:04:40.500> close<00:04:40.740> to<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.189> power<00:04:41.520> button<00:04:41.789> and

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
comes very close to the power button and

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.629 
comes very close to the power button and
then<00:04:42.479> there's<00:04:42.719> a<00:04:42.780> little<00:04:43.110> lip<00:04:43.469> at<00:04:43.650> the<00:04:43.770> back<00:04:44.039> so

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
then there's a little lip at the back so

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.820 
then there's a little lip at the back so
it<00:04:44.669> makes<00:04:44.909> it<00:04:45.060> easy<00:04:45.330> if<00:04:45.629> you're<00:04:45.780> coming<00:04:46.050> from

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
it makes it easy if you're coming from

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:49.879 
it makes it easy if you're coming from
behind<00:04:47.699> to<00:04:48.330> shape<00:04:48.629> coming<00:04:49.620> from<00:04:49.740> behind

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:49.889 
behind to shape coming from behind

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:51.909 
behind to shape coming from behind
depressing<00:04:50.610> it<00:04:50.669> like<00:04:50.789> that<00:04:51.000> it's<00:04:51.270> very<00:04:51.539> easy

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
depressing it like that it's very easy

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.990 
depressing it like that it's very easy
however<00:04:52.919> if<00:04:53.129> you're<00:04:53.250> coming<00:04:53.430> from<00:04:53.580> the<00:04:53.699> side

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
however if you're coming from the side

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.170 
however if you're coming from the side
like<00:04:54.180> how<00:04:54.330> I<00:04:54.539> normally<00:04:54.599> do<00:04:55.199> like<00:04:55.740> this<00:04:56.180> it

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
like how I normally do like this it

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.959 
like how I normally do like this it
definitely<00:04:57.569> makes<00:04:57.840> it<00:04:57.960> a<00:04:58.050> little<00:04:58.229> bit<00:04:58.409> harder

00:04:58.959 --> 00:04:58.969 
definitely makes it a little bit harder

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:03.080 
definitely makes it a little bit harder
but<00:04:59.969> nonetheless<00:05:00.300> it's<00:05:00.810> still<00:05:01.250> very<00:05:02.250> fairly

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 
but nonetheless it's still very fairly

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.809 
but nonetheless it's still very fairly
easy<00:05:03.479> about<00:05:04.110> to<00:05:04.289> use<00:05:04.530> now<00:05:05.279> here<00:05:05.520> we<00:05:05.669> have<00:05:05.789> a

00:05:05.809 --> 00:05:05.819 
easy about to use now here we have a

00:05:05.819 --> 00:05:07.999 
easy about to use now here we have a
large<00:05:06.210> cutout<00:05:06.569> for<00:05:06.870> the<00:05:06.930> headphone<00:05:07.500> jack<00:05:07.529> and

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
large cutout for the headphone jack and

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:10.760 
large cutout for the headphone jack and
a<00:05:08.310> cut<00:05:08.580> up<00:05:08.699> for<00:05:08.939> the<00:05:09.240> microphone<00:05:09.840> and<00:05:10.229> lastly<00:05:10.680> I

just want to point out you can see that

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:15.439 
just want to point out you can see that
the<00:05:13.349> case<00:05:13.560> doesn't<00:05:13.860> completely<00:05:14.550> cover<00:05:15.029> the

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:15.449 
the case doesn't completely cover the

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.409 
the case doesn't completely cover the
aluminum<00:05:16.289> on<00:05:16.439> the<00:05:16.469> side<00:05:16.889> now<00:05:17.490> this<00:05:17.819> I<00:05:18.060> happen

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:18.419 
aluminum on the side now this I happen

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:20.480 
aluminum on the side now this I happen
to<00:05:18.479> like<00:05:18.750> that<00:05:19.349> lets<00:05:19.590> you<00:05:19.740> see<00:05:20.039> some<00:05:20.310> of<00:05:20.340> the

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
to like that lets you see some of the

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.570 
to like that lets you see some of the
aluminum<00:05:21.060> around<00:05:21.930> the<00:05:22.020> side<00:05:22.490> however<00:05:23.490> you

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:23.580 
aluminum around the side however you

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:24.800 
aluminum around the side however you
know<00:05:23.610> some<00:05:23.909> people<00:05:24.270> might<00:05:24.419> want<00:05:24.689> it

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
completely covered I actually think it

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.890 
completely covered I actually think it
makes<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.319> look<00:05:28.439> a<00:05:28.529> lot<00:05:29.069> nicer<00:05:29.150> when<00:05:30.150> this<00:05:30.569> case

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
makes a look a lot nicer when this case

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:33.499 
makes a look a lot nicer when this case
doesn't<00:05:31.319> cover<00:05:31.680> all<00:05:31.860> of<00:05:32.039> you<00:05:32.340> alright<00:05:33.090> guys<00:05:33.300> so
