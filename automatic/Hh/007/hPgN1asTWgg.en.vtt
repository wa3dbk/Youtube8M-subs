all<00:02:34.330> right<00:02:34.540> let's<00:02:34.750> take<00:02:34.900> a<00:02:34.959> look<00:02:35.200> at<00:02:35.320> it<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:36.190> has

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
all right let's take a look at it it has

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.080 
all right let's take a look at it it has
this<00:02:36.550> button<00:02:36.790> here<00:02:37.209> let's<00:02:37.600> see<00:02:37.750> what<00:02:37.900> it<00:02:37.989> does

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
this button here let's see what it does

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.560 
this button here let's see what it does
all<00:02:40.090> right<00:02:40.330> Dee<00:02:40.540> chomping<00:02:41.050> teve<00:02:41.260> attack<00:02:41.709> I

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
all right Dee chomping teve attack I

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.420 
all right Dee chomping teve attack I
guess<00:02:43.570> that's<00:02:43.780> what<00:02:43.930> it<00:02:44.020> does<00:02:44.200> all<00:02:45.160> right<00:02:45.280> so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
guess that's what it does all right so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.410 
guess that's what it does all right so
let<00:02:45.580> me<00:02:45.610> try<00:02:45.820> to<00:02:45.880> get<00:02:46.060> this<00:02:46.239> in<00:02:46.420> here<00:02:46.600> in<00:02:46.810> here
