lose<00:02:07.770> every<00:02:08.130> turn<00:02:08.340> do<00:02:08.670> a<00:02:08.700> shot<00:02:08.940> every<00:02:09.119> time<00:02:09.269> you

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
lose every turn do a shot every time you

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.930 
lose every turn do a shot every time you
lose<00:02:09.950> I<00:02:10.950> guess<00:02:11.190> you<00:02:11.310> could<00:02:11.430> just<00:02:11.459> do<00:02:11.670> that<00:02:11.700> with

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
lose I guess you could just do that with

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.339 
lose I guess you could just do that with
any<00:02:12.150> game<00:02:12.360> it's<00:02:12.540> just<00:02:12.780> like<00:02:12.959> when<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.230> but

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
any game it's just like when you but

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:14.839 
any game it's just like when you but
this<00:02:13.500> was<00:02:13.680> worse<00:02:13.950> because<00:02:14.130> by<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.400> time<00:02:14.700> you

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
this was worse because by the time you

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.360 
this was worse because by the time you
take<00:02:15.090> a<00:02:15.150> shot<00:02:15.420> every<00:02:16.019> time<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.590> X<00:02:16.830> comes<00:02:17.190> up

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
take a shot every time and X comes up

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.780 
take a shot every time and X comes up
okay<00:02:18.120> so<00:02:18.680> those<00:02:19.680> video<00:02:20.040> games<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:20.550> still

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
okay so those video games are still

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.630 
okay so those video games are still
under<00:02:21.120> a<00:02:21.150> little<00:02:21.599> big<00:02:21.810> planet<00:02:21.840> to<00:02:22.640> bonus

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
under a little big planet to bonus

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.430 
under a little big planet to bonus
levels<00:02:24.090> I<00:02:24.360> guess<00:02:24.599> we'll<00:02:24.810> go<00:02:25.019> through<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.410> rest

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
levels I guess we'll go through the rest

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.020 
levels I guess we'll go through the rest
