is<00:00:06.930> made<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.170> polymer<00:00:08.160> clay<00:00:08.780> and<00:00:09.980> the<00:00:10.980> tools

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
is made with polymer clay and the tools

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.110 
is made with polymer clay and the tools
you<00:00:11.610> need<00:00:11.639> is<00:00:12.210> just<00:00:12.509> a<00:00:12.630> blade<00:00:13.610> by<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.670> way<00:00:14.910> this

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
there we go Cassie and then Trish pinch

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.360 
there we go Cassie and then Trish pinch
see<00:00:56.629> pinch<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.780> edges<00:00:58.520> to<00:00:59.520> get<00:00:59.670> like<00:00:59.850> a

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
see pinch the edges to get like a

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.820 
see pinch the edges to get like a
rectangle<00:01:02.370> look<00:01:03.059> but<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:03.960> make<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.530> edges

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
rectangle look but don't make the edges

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.120 
rectangle look but don't make the edges
really<00:01:05.430> harsh<00:01:05.869> make<00:01:06.869> them<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.770> little<00:01:07.799> bit

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
really harsh make them just a little bit

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:14.600 
really harsh make them just a little bit
bold<00:01:08.460> I<00:01:08.670> guess<00:01:09.320> so<00:01:10.820> like<00:01:11.820> that<00:01:12.740> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.250> take

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
bold I guess so like that and then take

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
bold I guess so like that and then take
your<00:01:14.850> blade<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.990> you're<00:01:16.259> just<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.470> to<00:01:16.560> cut

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
your blade and you're just going to cut

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.789 
your blade and you're just going to cut
out<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.159> triangle<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> middle<00:01:18.290> C<00:01:19.290> like

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
out one triangle in the middle C like

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.560 
out one triangle in the middle C like
that<00:01:20.390> shouldn't<00:01:21.390> cut<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.990> out<00:01:22.759> this<00:01:23.759> this<00:01:24.509> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
that shouldn't cut that out this this is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.260 
that shouldn't cut that out this this is
really<00:01:24.990> easy<00:01:25.259> and<00:01:25.500> really<00:01:25.590> fun<00:01:26.130> to<00:01:26.280> make<00:01:26.430> and

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
really easy and really fun to make and

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.520 
really easy and really fun to make and
they're<00:01:27.509> really<00:01:27.750> do<00:01:28.080> too<00:01:28.350> so

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.899 

do<00:01:34.130> that<00:01:35.380> then<00:01:36.380> kind<00:01:36.680> of<00:01:36.770> tweak<00:01:37.460> it<00:01:37.670> to<00:01:37.880> make

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909
