00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.480
 Hi guys, how are we here? 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.660
 time and we continue with the issue of balance 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:13.360
 of masses 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.440
 next we are presented with solve 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.440
 the next problem 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:25.050
 a solution composed of 50% by weight of 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.140
 ethanol 10% by weight of methanol and 40% by weight 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.450
 Water weight is fed to a cup 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.699
 of 100 kilograms over now to a 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:35.160
 separator that produces a current to 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:38.550
 a rate of 60 kilograms over now 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.360
 with the following composition 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.210
 80 percent by weight of ethanol 15 per 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.469
 percent in the weight of methanol and 5 percent 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.469
 one hundred percent by weight of water 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.800
 the separator also produces a second 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.440
 current of unknown composition 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.050
 calculates the basic composition for 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.900
 three compounds in the stream 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.230
 unknown and its magical flow in 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:09.900
 kilograms per hour 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.120
 because in this balance problem 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.940
 of mass we have no production nor 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.770
 accumulation of matter the equation for 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:18.810
 the mass balance we have that all 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.150
 the matter that goes in will be equal to 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.310
 all the stuff that come out 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.950
 the next step is to determine if this 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.420
 problem has a solution for it 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 we use the tool of the 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.340
 degrees of freedom the formula for 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.770
 calculate the degrees of freedom tells us 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.720
 that degrees of freedom are going to be 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.030
 equal to the number of unknowns 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.640
 - the number of balances linearly 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:45.800
 independent less the number of 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.230
 relationships between variables 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.230
 by applying the formula of degrees of 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:54.170
 freedom to this problem we observe that 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:56.210
 we have four unknowns which 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.270
 we mark precisely with x in color 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:02.180
 red we have three balances linearly 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:05.570
 independent ie three components 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:07.730
 that enter the system the components of 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.720
 mix that enter the system in this 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:14.000
 case we have ethanol methanol and water and 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.370
 finally we have a relationship between 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.980
 variables in this case we have to the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.330
 sum of all mass fractions in the 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:27.500
 flow in f2 must give us 1 meaning 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.370
 100% and then calculating 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:33.830
 degrees of freedom we have that 4 - 3 - 1 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.500
 results in 20 degrees of 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:40.510
 freedom which tells us that this 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.510
 problem if you have a solution 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.520
 now that we know that the problem has 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.520
 solution in the next step would be 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.950
 then perform the mass balance in 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.620
 this case the equation for the balance 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.069
 overall we have that f 1 will be the same 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.859
 efe 2 ep3 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:01.810
 from there then observing that we know 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:03.889
 precisely the flow in f1 and in f3 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.459
 we can calculate it simply 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:09.469
 clearing and replacing the values 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.989
 so we have then that f 2 is going to be 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:15.290
 equal to 100 kilograms over now less 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:20.740
 60 kilograms over now which gives us 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.260
 as a result 40 kilograms per hour 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.690
 in the case of balance sheets for each 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.000
 of the components that enter the system 

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:31.720
 we have then that the balance of 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.930
 ethanol is that 50 kilograms over 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:38.470
 now it will be equal to 48 to 48 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.670
 kilograms about now plus a fraction 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:44.400
 unknown mass in f2 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.800
 the methanol one we have left that 10 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:50.489
 kilograms over now it's going to be equal to 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:53.580
 9 kilograms over now plus the amount 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.910
 unknown methanol that exists in the 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:57.950
 flow in f2 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.900
 and the water we have left that 40 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.110
 kilograms over now it's going to be equal to 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:06.500
 3 kilograms about now plus the quantity 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:09.160
 unknown that there is water in the 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.160
 flow in gp2 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.170
 in this case we see that in all 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.090
 balance sheets we observe that we only have one 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.190
 incognita precisely the quantities 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:22.400
 precisely ethanol methanol and 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:23.510
 water in the flow in i2 f2 then what 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.080
 only thing we have to do to 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.340
 calculate them is simply clear the 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.040
 clear these values ​​precisely from 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.139
 the previous equations so we have 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.210
 that the unknown amount of ethanol in 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:37.580
 the flow in f2 will be equal to 50 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:39.889
 kilograms about now minus 48 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.050
 kilograms about now which gives us 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:45.620
 as a result 2 kilograms over now 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.270
 in the case of methanol, we have to 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:49.130
 unknown amount of methane in the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.020
 flow in f2 will be equal to 10 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:53.510
 kilograms about now minus 9 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.770
 kilograms about now which gives us 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:59.930
 as a result one kilogram over now 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.910
 in the case of water we have to 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:04.340
 unknown amount of water in the flow 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.909
 in f2 it will be equal to 40 kilograms 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:10.069
 about an hour less than 3 kg on time 

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:13.819
 which results in 37 

00:05:10.069 --> 00:05:15.830
 kg on time with which we have 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:18.230
 calculated all the values ​​he asks us 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.360
 this problem 

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.400
 once we have already calculated all the 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.990
 data that is asked of us within the 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.880
 mass balance problem the 

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:27.530
 then next step would be to translate 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.140
 this information in what would be a 

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:31.910
 diagram in this case we observe that in 

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:34.430
 the diagram already we put what are the 

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.830
 flows we have that f1 is equal to 100 

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:39.080
 kilograms over hour efe 2 equals 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.230
 40 kilograms over now f3 like this is 

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:43.550
 equal to 60 kilograms over now 

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:45.410
 we place precisely the fractions 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.840
 more than each of the components of 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.490
 that enter each of the flows or 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.410
 that come out in each of the flows and 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.180
 we calculate precisely the amount of 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.850
 each of the components of the mixture 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:58.280
 in each respective bar in each 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:01.310
 respective flow with which 

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.000
 we have precisely finished this 

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:04.000
 problem
