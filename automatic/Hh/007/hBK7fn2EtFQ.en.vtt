00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
defending side also considering the fact

defending side also considering the fact
that<00:01:32.940> I<00:01:33.870> probably<00:01:34.380> contributed<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.100> that<00:01:35.130> a

that I probably contributed to that a

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.280 
that I probably contributed to that a
lot<00:01:35.520> because<00:01:35.729> when<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.270> are<00:01:36.420> killing<00:01:36.870> you're

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
lot because when you are killing you're

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.680 
lot because when you are killing you're
obviously<00:01:37.590> are<00:01:37.890> removing<00:01:38.490> viet<00:01:38.760> taking<00:01:39.570> down

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
obviously are removing viet taking down

obviously are removing viet taking down
the<00:01:39.810> enemy's<00:01:40.110> ticket<00:01:40.440> count<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> currently<00:01:42.450> my

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
using the n point 154 scope I think it

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
using the n point 154 scope I think it
is<00:01:57.420> or<00:01:57.810> something<00:01:58.200> something<00:01:58.560> like<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.950> and

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
is or something something like that and

is or something something like that and

then the flash suppressor flash

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
that and I certainly recommend it if

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:26.430 
you're I wouldn't say camping but let's

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.610 
you're I wouldn't say camping but let's
say<00:02:26.610> tactically<00:02:27.420> positioned<00:02:28.020> in<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.380> hallway

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
say tactically positioned in a hallway

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.460

of brings me to my next point on
operation<00:02:33.210> Metro<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:33.810> fact<00:02:34.020> that<00:02:34.230> this

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
operation Metro is the fact that this

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.790

work<00:03:20.010> out<00:03:20.220> very<00:03:20.400> well<00:03:20.520> if<00:03:20.790> you're<00:03:20.940> only<00:03:21.450> if<00:03:22.230> you

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
work out very well if you're only if you

only have that many bolts to shoot
because<00:03:23.850> personally<00:03:24.420> I<00:03:24.450> really<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.959> to<00:03:25.080> have

because personally I really like to have
at<00:03:25.410> least<00:03:25.440> at<00:03:25.980> least<00:03:26.070> 100<00:03:27.060> bullets<00:03:27.420> to<00:03:28.230> be<00:03:28.350> able

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
at least at least 100 bullets to be able

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.550 
at least at least 100 bullets to be able
to<00:03:28.590> spray<00:03:28.830> down<00:03:28.860> range<00:03:29.750> because<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:31.440> obviously

to spray down range because it obviously

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.410 
to spray down range because it obviously
minimizes<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.610> amount<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.940> times<00:03:33.090> you're

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
minimizes the amount of times you're

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.060 
minimizes the amount of times you're
going<00:03:33.540> to<00:03:33.600> have<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.840> reload<00:03:34.230> but<00:03:34.830> it<00:03:34.920> also

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
going to have to reload but it also

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.920 
going to have to reload but it also
increases<00:03:35.730> the<00:03:36.090> duration<00:03:36.480> for<00:03:36.600> the<00:03:36.660> amount<00:03:36.840> of

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
increases the duration for the amount of

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.720 
increases the duration for the amount of

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
time you're going to be able to suppress

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:41.060 
time you're going to be able to suppress
your<00:03:39.150> enemy<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:39.780> that's<00:03:40.470> also<00:03:40.709> going<00:03:40.830> to<00:03:40.890> give

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
your enemy and that's also going to give

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.460 
your enemy and that's also going to give
your<00:03:41.220> your<00:03:41.880> squad<00:03:42.209> more<00:03:42.480> time<00:03:42.690> to<00:03:42.810> move<00:03:42.989> up<00:03:43.200> and

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
your your squad more time to move up and

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.660 
your your squad more time to move up and
set<00:03:44.370> up<00:03:44.459> position<00:03:45.060> around<00:03:45.330> the<00:03:45.720> mcom<00:03:46.080> stations

you don't necessarily have to sit right
next<00:03:51.660> to<00:03:51.840> or<00:03:52.110> even<00:03:52.560> in<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:53.040> direct<00:03:53.280> vicinity

of the mcom station you can actually

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.580 
of the mcom station you can actually
there's<00:03:56.850> actually<00:03:57.060> a<00:03:57.300> certain<00:03:57.930> choke<00:03:58.230> points

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
there's actually a certain choke points

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.320 
there's actually a certain choke points
which<00:03:58.739> will<00:03:58.890> be<00:03:58.980> seeing<00:03:59.400> me<00:03:59.580> use<00:03:59.820> that<00:04:00.090> are

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
which will be seeing me use that are

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.479 
which will be seeing me use that are
they<00:04:01.050> kind<00:04:01.290> of<00:04:01.380> lead<00:04:01.620> up<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.860> the<00:04:02.160> UM<00:04:02.250> comp

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
they kind of lead up to the UM comp

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.280 
they kind of lead up to the UM comp
station<00:04:02.940> but<00:04:03.060> aren't<00:04:03.269> necessarily<00:04:03.780> directly

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
close to near the middle of the map but

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.229 
close to near the middle of the map but
since<00:04:10.920> i<00:04:11.040> have<00:04:11.070> my<00:04:11.310> bipod<00:04:11.700> and<00:04:11.730> flash

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
using a scoped gun I believe that my

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.199 
using a scoped gun I believe that my

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
I am NOT a sniper because that is

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.250 
I am NOT a sniper because that is

kit<00:04:31.379> as<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> whole<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:32.159> am<00:04:32.370> also<00:04:32.610> using<00:04:32.789> squad

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
kit as a whole I am also using squad

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.469 
kit as a whole I am also using squad
ammo<00:04:33.659> which<00:04:33.930> gives<00:04:34.169> my<00:04:34.379> squad<00:04:34.969> extra<00:04:35.969> ammo<00:04:36.150> so

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
ammo which gives my squad extra ammo so

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.570 
ammo which gives my squad extra ammo so
regardless<00:04:37.469> of<00:04:37.680> the<00:04:37.770> fact<00:04:38.009> that<00:04:38.099> I'm<00:04:38.249> going<00:04:38.460> to

them<00:04:43.110> more<00:04:43.710> ammo<00:04:44.069> right<00:04:44.219> off<00:04:44.370> the<00:04:44.490> bat<00:04:44.669> since

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
them more ammo right off the bat since

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.999 
them more ammo right off the bat since
I'm<00:04:45.029> using<00:04:45.150> squad<00:04:45.629> ammo<00:04:45.930> i<00:04:46.199> think<00:04:46.770> i'm<00:04:46.860> also

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:47.009 
I'm using squad ammo i think i'm also

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:49.369 
I'm using squad ammo i think i'm also
using<00:04:47.129> an<00:04:47.520> mp4<00:04:48.120> for<00:04:48.330> 3<00:04:48.569> with<00:04:48.719> tactical<00:04:49.199> light

using an mp4 for 3 with tactical light

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:52.309 
using an mp4 for 3 with tactical light
and<00:04:49.610> I<00:04:50.610> actually<00:04:51.029> don't<00:04:51.270> plan<00:04:51.569> on<00:04:51.779> using<00:04:51.990> the

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:52.319 
and I actually don't plan on using the

00:04:52.319 --> 00:04:54.649 
and I actually don't plan on using the
squad<00:04:52.770> ammo<00:04:53.009> kit<00:04:53.340> once<00:04:53.550> i<00:04:53.699> unlock<00:04:53.729> the<00:04:53.969> m20

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:54.659 
squad ammo kit once i unlock the m20

squad ammo kit once i unlock the m20
m224<00:04:55.650> mortar<00:04:55.860> because<00:04:56.639> that<00:04:57.210> seems<00:04:57.479> like<00:04:57.659> it

00:04:57.739 --> 00:04:57.749 
m224 mortar because that seems like it

00:04:57.749 --> 00:04:59.200 
m224 mortar because that seems like it
would<00:04:57.810> be<00:04:57.870> a<00:04:57.960> gadget<00:04:58.229> that's<00:04:58.529> going<00:04:58.710> to<00:04:58.770> be<00:04:58.860> um

00:04:59.200 --> 00:04:59.210 
would be a gadget that's going to be um

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:01.219 
would be a gadget that's going to be um
it's<00:05:00.210> going<00:05:00.360> to<00:05:00.389> be<00:05:00.509> really<00:05:00.659> fun<00:05:00.960> to<00:05:01.050> use

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
it's going to be really fun to use

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.899 
it's going to be really fun to use
another<00:05:01.949> good<00:05:02.129> light<00:05:02.279> machine<00:05:02.580> gun<00:05:02.729> that<00:05:02.759> I

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
another good light machine gun that I

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:04.670 
another good light machine gun that I
would<00:05:03.029> recommend<00:05:03.300> in<00:05:03.659> the<00:05:03.839> support<00:05:04.259> kit<00:05:04.439> would

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.189 
would recommend in the support kit would
probably<00:05:05.069> be<00:05:05.219> the<00:05:05.339> pkp<00:05:05.999> Pe'Shon<00:05:06.599> because<00:05:06.960> I

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:07.199 
probably be the pkp Pe'Shon because I

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:09.019 
probably be the pkp Pe'Shon because I
think<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.740> does<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:07.919> little<00:05:08.099> higher<00:05:08.370> damage<00:05:08.669> but

00:05:09.019 --> 00:05:09.029 
think it does a little higher damage but

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:12.010 
think it does a little higher damage but
it<00:05:09.120> also<00:05:09.270> has<00:05:09.569> a<00:05:09.860> significantly<00:05:10.860> higher

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
it also has a significantly higher

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.890 
it also has a significantly higher
higher<00:05:13.020> vertical<00:05:13.939> kick<00:05:14.939> to<00:05:15.419> it<00:05:15.449> when<00:05:15.749> you're

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
higher vertical kick to it when you're

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.329 
higher vertical kick to it when you're
aiming<00:05:16.289> down<00:05:16.379> the<00:05:16.439> iron<00:05:16.770> sights<00:05:17.009> even<00:05:17.219> with<00:05:17.310> a

00:05:17.329 --> 00:05:17.339 
aiming down the iron sights even with a

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:20.779 
aiming down the iron sights even with a
bipod<00:05:17.839> it<00:05:18.839> does<00:05:19.139> kick<00:05:19.740> quite<00:05:20.189> a<00:05:20.219> bit<00:05:20.460> so<00:05:20.639> you're

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:20.789 
bipod it does kick quite a bit so you're

00:05:20.789 --> 00:05:22.100 
bipod it does kick quite a bit so you're
going<00:05:20.879> to<00:05:20.939> have<00:05:20.999> to<00:05:21.300> compensate<00:05:21.629> with<00:05:21.839> that

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:22.110 
going to have to compensate with that

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.129 
going to have to compensate with that
with<00:05:22.289> tap<00:05:22.979> firing<00:05:23.249> so<00:05:23.669> you<00:05:23.729> can<00:05:23.999> you<00:05:24.839> know<00:05:24.930> just

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:25.139 
with tap firing so you can you know just

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.200 
with tap firing so you can you know just
tapping<00:05:25.379> that<00:05:25.560> right<00:05:26.099> trigger<00:05:26.370> on<00:05:26.669> either

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
tapping that right trigger on either

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:30.170 
tapping that right trigger on either
playstation<00:05:27.900> or<00:05:28.080> xbox<00:05:28.110> or<00:05:28.860> tapping<00:05:29.699> that<00:05:29.849> left

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
playstation or xbox or tapping that left

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.179 
playstation or xbox or tapping that left
click<00:05:30.389> button<00:05:30.419> on<00:05:30.839> your<00:05:30.960> mouse<00:05:31.039> so<00:05:32.039> that

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:32.189 
click button on your mouse so that

00:05:32.189 --> 00:05:33.230 
click button on your mouse so that
you're<00:05:32.310> going<00:05:32.400> to<00:05:32.460> be<00:05:32.550> able<00:05:32.610> to<00:05:32.759> suppress<00:05:33.060> them

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
you're going to be able to suppress them

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.869 
you're going to be able to suppress them
effectively<00:05:33.870> and<00:05:34.430> hopefully<00:05:35.430> gain<00:05:35.759> an

00:05:35.869 --> 00:05:35.879 
effectively and hopefully gain an

00:05:35.879 --> 00:05:37.570 
effectively and hopefully gain an
advantage<00:05:36.029> on<00:05:36.569> that<00:05:36.750> choke<00:05:36.990> point<00:05:37.229> so

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
advantage on that choke point so

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:39.709 
advantage on that choke point so
hopefully<00:05:38.580> i<00:05:38.610> i'd<00:05:39.089> like<00:05:39.300> to<00:05:39.419> hope<00:05:39.509> that<00:05:39.569> I

00:05:39.709 --> 00:05:39.719 
hopefully i i'd like to hope that I

00:05:39.719 --> 00:05:41.480 
hopefully i i'd like to hope that I
could<00:05:39.930> help<00:05:40.050> you<00:05:40.229> guys<00:05:40.349> with<00:05:40.409> these<00:05:40.800> show

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:41.490 
could help you guys with these show

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:43.040 
could help you guys with these show
points<00:05:41.819> a<00:05:41.879> little<00:05:42.089> I<00:05:42.149> mean<00:05:42.330> this<00:05:42.449> is<00:05:42.629> a<00:05:42.659> very

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
points a little I mean this is a very

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.439 
points a little I mean this is a very
very<00:05:43.409> effective<00:05:44.009> kit<00:05:44.399> especially<00:05:44.610> on<00:05:45.240> this

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:45.449 
very effective kit especially on this

00:05:45.449 --> 00:05:48.079 
very effective kit especially on this
map<00:05:45.719> I'd<00:05:46.680> certainly<00:05:47.039> not<00:05:47.399> recommend<00:05:47.909> using

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:48.089 
map I'd certainly not recommend using

00:05:48.089 --> 00:05:49.939 
map I'd certainly not recommend using
this<00:05:48.330> outdoors<00:05:48.810> because<00:05:49.050> it's<00:05:49.529> more<00:05:49.770> of<00:05:49.860> an

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
this outdoors because it's more of an

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:52.939 
this outdoors because it's more of an
expansive<00:05:50.719> areas<00:05:51.719> area<00:05:52.289> in<00:05:52.409> the<00:05:52.500> first<00:05:52.710> stage

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
expansive areas area in the first stage

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.350 
expansive areas area in the first stage
of<00:05:53.159> the<00:05:53.279> operation<00:05:53.310> Metro<00:05:53.939> met<00:05:54.089> we<00:05:54.240> should

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
of the operation Metro met we should

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.909 
of the operation Metro met we should
probably<00:05:54.539> go<00:05:54.750> with<00:05:54.810> an<00:05:54.930> engineer<00:05:55.319> or<00:05:55.529> a<00:05:55.589> salt

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
probably go with an engineer or a salt

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:57.679 
probably go with an engineer or a salt
or<00:05:56.159> recon<00:05:56.639> kit<00:05:56.879> but<00:05:57.089> probably<00:05:57.419> not<00:05:57.539> the

00:05:57.679 --> 00:05:57.689 
or recon kit but probably not the

00:05:57.689 --> 00:05:59.420 
or recon kit but probably not the
support<00:05:58.020> kit<00:05:58.199> but<00:05:58.740> certainly<00:05:59.069> when<00:05:59.189> you're<00:05:59.339> in

00:05:59.420 --> 00:05:59.430 
support kit but certainly when you're in

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:03.980 
support kit but certainly when you're in
the<00:05:59.490> subway<00:05:59.849> or<00:06:00.409> the<00:06:01.409> last<00:06:02.219> last<00:06:03.180> stage<00:06:03.509> when

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:03.990 
the subway or the last last stage when

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:05.329 
the subway or the last last stage when
you're<00:06:04.110> up<00:06:04.289> in<00:06:04.409> those<00:06:04.499> apartment<00:06:05.009> buildings

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
you're up in those apartment buildings

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.730 
you're up in those apartment buildings
it's<00:06:05.520> certainly<00:06:05.789> a<00:06:05.879> good<00:06:06.029> idea<00:06:06.300> to<00:06:06.569> set<00:06:07.560> up<00:06:07.649> a

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
it's certainly a good idea to set up a

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.579 
it's certainly a good idea to set up a
bipod<00:06:08.129> for<00:06:08.520> a<00:06:08.550> good<00:06:09.509> position<00:06:09.930> so<00:06:10.259> I'll<00:06:10.529> just

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:10.589 
bipod for a good position so I'll just

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:12.409 
bipod for a good position so I'll just
done<00:06:10.860> you<00:06:10.979> guys<00:06:11.129> with<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.339> little<00:06:11.699> c4<00:06:11.999> clip
