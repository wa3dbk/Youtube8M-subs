00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
I think I think Glade being special is

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:44.639 
I think I think Glade being special is
because<00:01:41.979> of<00:01:42.189> of<00:01:42.609> the<00:01:42.909> virus<00:01:43.539> Scott<00:01:44.140> you're

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:44.649 
because of of the virus Scott you're

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:46.559 
because of of the virus Scott you're
having<00:01:45.130> close<00:01:45.340> but<00:01:46.000> you've<00:01:46.149> got<00:01:46.359> you've<00:01:46.539> got

00:01:46.559 --> 00:01:46.569 
having close but you've got you've got

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.630 
having close but you've got you've got
the<00:01:46.780> natural<00:01:47.170> surroundings<00:01:47.770> and<00:01:47.979> it<00:01:48.340> feels

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
the natural surroundings and it feels

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.969 
the natural surroundings and it feels
it's<00:01:49.179> the<00:01:49.359> coolest<00:01:49.569> place<00:01:49.899> but<00:01:50.170> I<00:01:50.200> just<00:01:50.500> grown

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
it's the coolest place but I just grown

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.490 
it's the coolest place but I just grown
up<00:01:51.219> from<00:01:51.490> a<00:01:52.000> great<00:01:52.299> underground<00:01:52.659> movement<00:01:53.289> of

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:53.500 
up from a great underground movement of

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.919 
up from a great underground movement of
the<00:01:53.890> dance<00:01:54.280> culture<00:01:54.579> I<00:01:55.000> think<00:01:55.060> it's<00:01:55.689> just

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
the dance culture I think it's just

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.630 
the dance culture I think it's just
because<00:01:56.319> little<00:01:56.890> bit<00:01:57.130> of<00:01:57.219> everything<00:01:57.340> here

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
because little bit of everything here

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.130 
because little bit of everything here
you<00:01:58.030> know<00:01:58.119> sometimes<00:01:58.509> it's<00:01:58.659> really<00:01:58.750> chilled

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
you know sometimes it's really chilled

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.199 
you know sometimes it's really chilled
and<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.619> can<00:01:59.770> just<00:01:59.860> sort<00:02:00.009> of<00:02:00.099> lay<00:02:00.729> down<00:02:00.969> and

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
and you can just sort of lay down and

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:02.699 
and you can just sort of lay down and
chill<00:02:01.390> out<00:02:01.509> ready<00:02:01.810> for<00:02:01.989> the<00:02:02.049> band<00:02:02.229> can<00:02:02.409> I<00:02:02.530> and
