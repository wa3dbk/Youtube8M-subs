 been a bit weird a team duel 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.910
 Well, well, well, you have to adapt 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.190
 so then you will see that I change 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.220

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.600
 yesterday that's tremendous because I know that 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.850
 some of you have given us 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.170
 account is worth it because I was fast but 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.300
 look what I'm going to say even if 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.540
 charged then I think her say my mother 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.750
 go melon then what happened then something 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.329
 very simple that I'm ever a 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.430
 little bit because I messed up that's why 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.350
 you have to be ordered in kids you have to 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.080
 keep working in this life then 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.540
 what happens then 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.470
 I have the videos because it typically 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.630
 he recorded it with rubin me that keeps recording 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.310
 jofran that if you play normal games 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.140
 to comment that is the same 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:20.350
 good is a lot of things that if the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.530
 live that then the pamela the audio by the 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.780
 Treasury Treasury one that Shizz then it 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:29.920
 the best on the hard drive you put on 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.320
 I know 80 games or 70 games that 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.350
 Well, some of them I like very 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.420
 little very very very few and then it is the 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.300
 restore I have there because good then to 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.270
 the best thing you can do to record or such or not 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:44.890
 ok not for the end all that not then 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.320
 what happens because they always come together 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.960
 all and I lose games that are cool 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.040
 and all that but just like that happens to me 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:56.470
 it happens to me that I take and upload a video 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.040
 that had already gone up and measure wait we're going 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.920
 to see see 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:03.170
 I start thinking and you say let's see 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.270
 the fool can be impossible as a 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.130
 little bit says how you will not realize 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.009
 that the rise if you've played that 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.810
 game is worth it to go well but it is 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:13.580
 that is clear what happened to me yesterday is 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.550
 that raised a game that had gone up 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:18.770
 in January-February you know that it's not 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.540
 months have passed and I've seen by 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:22.610
 I say the game is over 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:24.530
 this one is pretty this is cool and such and 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:29.900
 I'll put the audio sync 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:32.209
 and then when you pick it up and it's going to go up and 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:35.450
 the whole story because it happens then that it 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.240
 he threw the ball at me completely that is why 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.670
 In addition, it was in the folder 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.450
 that of videos that are not uploaded that 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.209
 they are worth 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:47.270
 in that folder and such a good charger 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:49.970
 never people parting their asses 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:51.430
 twitter for the comments there in 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:55.850
 Youtube 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:58.430
 Can you imagine do not take it and from the green 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:01.790
 that you who are there to everything 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.849
 that obviously you realize then yes 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:07.000
 I take the comments I say I'm going 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.730
 because this has already gone up that is 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.170
 built and effectively as there is the 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:18.349
 saber is new video because I picked up and went up 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.150
 the video that had gone up in February like this 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:22.760
 that good here where you shit votes 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:25.459
 as well as a little anecdote and if so 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.359
 already in step that I also did it very 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.709
 quickly because I already happened to be 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.510
 someone who says fuck because we have the 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:34.970
 three there has been yesterday and he does not know and such 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.519
 As we have already explained , I 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.139
 I take it I'm worth it but well what else 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:41.269
 that more than more I had to comment 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:43.549
 a good thing, well , apart from what it is 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.319
 Sunday a pilonga chestnut or the 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:47.419
 Sundays are cool because it's quiet 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:49.300
 everything is like that but let's make us cool 

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.760
 a little bit 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.710
 and then, well, well, apart from that 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.870
 you have to start with the full week that 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:58.420
 I think many of you are from 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.280
 exams and well finally a few things and 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.110
 Now I'm still with that subject but I wanted you 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.550
 comment or I do not know if you have 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:09.160
 it is fixed or is it flipante 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:11.800
 pull all the time down the cliff look 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.680
 look vitamin those of my team are thrown 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.330
 all the time and they do not stop again that they 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.250
 Look strip I think now it's shot 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.950
 again that is three times watching one 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.350
 rare match says what it is that you 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:25.840
 I say apart that the others as the ones from 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:28.480
 another team that moved little and everything 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:30.550
 that then look or be in my team it 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.250
 they're pulling all the time I do not know what 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.830
 they wanted to get if maybe a uy 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.990
 that circling and fishing someone 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.150
 that passes through past or do not know exactly 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:41.920
 what they were doing but I stayed 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:44.500
 crazy good then see in the comments 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.210
 to which you put and what you think they were 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 doing and all that because I the truth 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:51.700
 that I was crazy or what I say this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:54.150
 not normal but good to what I was going 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:56.010
 I do not know why I do not know very well either 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:58.170
 but I think you are in times of 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.889
 exams or many of you have already 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:03.740
 finished I have a cousin 

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.300
 Rodrigo and such Rodriguez who has already 

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:06.620
 finished the exams and all that but 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.719
 that is not underway and the auditor already 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:11.719
 story I think for the people who 

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:13.879
 have we go how good it is in 

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:15.319
 primary or secondary is that still 

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.180
 it's not running and you're still going 

00:05:15.319 --> 00:05:19.669
 follow exams so nothing about 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:21.439
 everything took advantage since I have here tempeh 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:24.800
 cited in the video because I take advantage of 

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:28.039
 say stop meditating and clear yes 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:30.620
 and it's good that you're lucky not only 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.629
 I thought one thing is worth and that everything 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:34.490
 that you study now then later you do not have 

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:38.719
 to study over if you have some left 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:41.090
 or they will annoy parents in the east 

00:05:38.719 --> 00:05:43.340
 that is in summer but you are going to have to 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.189
 do work that if I do not know that if I do not know 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.590
 how much better then it is to study 

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:51.439
 Now, you know, and then, well, well, 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:53.479
 I took what I gave you that if 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:56.659
 little one who can go to the beach that I 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.909
 go I know what it is to lose this year not 

00:05:56.659 --> 00:06:00.620
 I know if we can to the beach gold good as well 

00:05:58.909 --> 00:06:03.560
 I'm not going home to frank and that's it 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.419
 in the house of fraga and beach so I'm leaving 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:07.820
 for there and abroad and then what 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.640
 I say to you pummeling so 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:13.190
 also this video goes for you like this 

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:14.840
 to give him a straw and study how good 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.400
 Well, at least you have to be a man of 

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:17.990
 advantage I have always said that there is 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:20.060
 study careers to earn money and 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:22.490
 Forlán, no, that's what I had 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:24.980
 that there to win pasta to make a 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:27.020
 good career studying notary that is 

00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:29.750
 so it's a judge's nose let's go so 

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:32.150
 things of those that you the money money or 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.250
 an engineering and well then if you do not 

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:36.290
 takes us like that and like other things 

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.120
 the important thing is kids of 6 who do not 

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:40.880
 they study what you want because 

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.740
 that's what there are so good kids 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:44.690
 look at the game 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:48.920
 here we go I charge one I charge another 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:51.110

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:56.930

 the departures to the state pulling this 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:06.380
 some are left standing 

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:09.650
 I now charge one I charge the other 

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:12.950
