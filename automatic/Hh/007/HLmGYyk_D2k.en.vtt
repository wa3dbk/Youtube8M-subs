 I'll be making a video showing 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:39.659
 how do you use it and what is it for the brush 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.619

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.239
 side for the big and even drawings 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.190
 for those little ones 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:32.980

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.970
 various patterns of odors and arabesques 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.840
 the other card I come with a few more 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.330
 flower prints 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.910
 this one with a plastic in 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:09.070
 but here up well with this cut can 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:11.580
 say that you have to take it out to be able to 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:11.580
 use 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:32.580
 this plate of affection came some 

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:34.380
 drawings in arabesque and flower and the last 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.540
 came in a variety of shapes with 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.540
 lines circles and other patterns 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.430
 totally of 5 inserts for stamp 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.920
 with several beautiful designs 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.870
 I 'm going to make a video for each one too. 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.380
 plaque and showing the drawings better 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.380
 from them 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.250
 now I'll do a test to show 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.240
 for you the effect of drawing with 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:59.910
 affection 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:07.620
 I will use the kit stamp scraper 

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:09.570
 one of the little plaques here in the mines 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:15.420
 I'll be making the flower print 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:17.250
 It's the one that has several lines together here. 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.609
 I'll put a piece of 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.860
 cotton to clean excess enamel 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:24.960
 good to be wearing ordinary black enamel 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.390
 It does not have to be a nail polish. 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.710
 then I will spend a little enamel on 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.710
 top of the drawing 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.860
 then comes the tracker and motorcycle shavings 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:45.860
 down 

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:52.689
 with a large side of the stamp and the 

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:55.409
 pressing on the drawing that goes 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:55.409
 stay like this 

00:04:57.839 --> 00:05:03.849
 then you choose which wedge goes 

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:06.099
 stamp stamping position and will come from a 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:08.339
 side by pressing under the 

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:08.339
 nail 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:16.839
 the design will stay that way until it seems the 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:19.389
 affection that confuses with remains of 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:22.689
 Enamel always use it has to clean 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:26.249
 with cotton and acetone both the plaque 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:26.249
 both stamp and scraper 

00:05:36.790 --> 00:06:06.740
 then just wipe the sides of the nail and 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:07.820
 pass a layer of varnish and this is the 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.710
 result 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.320
 a show quickly with time 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.120
