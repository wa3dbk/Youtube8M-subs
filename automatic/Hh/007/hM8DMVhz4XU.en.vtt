mahogany<00:00:43.879> goes<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.180> 18<00:00:45.710> appointments

mahogany goes with the 18 appointments

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.569 
mahogany goes with the 18 appointments
so<00:00:48.480> you're<00:00:48.690> looking<00:00:48.809> at<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.190> guitar<00:00:50.190> that<00:00:50.550> you

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
so you're looking at a guitar that you

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.790 
so you're looking at a guitar that you
can<00:00:50.820> articulate<00:00:51.690> well<00:00:52.079> because<00:00:52.379> the<00:00:52.500> strings

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
can articulate well because the strings

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.250 
can articulate well because the strings
are<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.949> little<00:00:53.129> bit<00:00:53.340> less<00:00:53.719> tension<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:54.989> them<00:00:55.110> so

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
are a little bit less tension on them so

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.720 
are a little bit less tension on them so
it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.410> little<00:00:55.559> bit<00:00:55.770> more<00:00:55.920> subtle

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's a little bit more subtle

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.529 
it's a little bit more subtle
a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.120> bit<00:00:57.239> more<00:00:57.420> soft<00:00:58.760> it<00:00:59.760> is<00:01:00.210> also

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
a little bit more soft it is also

donor<00:01:38.970> so<00:01:39.780> some<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.079> its<00:01:40.320> DNA<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:41.329> included<00:01:42.329> in

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.660 
donor so some of its DNA is included in
the<00:01:42.780> amplification<00:01:43.320> system<00:01:44.009> that's<00:01:44.189> included

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
the amplification system that's included

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
the amplification system that's included
on<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> guitar<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.240> so<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:46.829> an
