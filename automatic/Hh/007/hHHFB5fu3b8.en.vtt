00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.960 
and then a two on side which is right
here<00:04:02.630> I<00:04:03.019> never<00:04:03.560> cut<00:04:03.830> this<00:04:04.010> piece<00:04:04.310> of<00:04:04.489> lace<00:04:04.730> off

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
here I never cut this piece of lace off

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:07.060 
here I never cut this piece of lace off
in<00:04:05.150> the<00:04:05.239> back<00:04:05.420> because<00:04:05.720> I<00:04:06.290> don't<00:04:06.739> never<00:04:06.860> be

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
in the back because I don't never be

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:08.470 
in the back because I don't never be
putting<00:04:07.310> my<00:04:07.370> hair<00:04:07.549> up<00:04:07.580> enough<00:04:07.850> ponytails

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:08.480 
putting my hair up enough ponytails

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.410 
putting my hair up enough ponytails
so<00:04:08.810> it<00:04:09.380> really<00:04:09.530> don't<00:04:09.799> serve<00:04:09.980> no<00:04:10.100> purpose<00:04:10.420> the

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:11.420 
so it really don't serve no purpose the

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:14.199 
so it really don't serve no purpose the
hair<00:04:11.660> texture<00:04:12.410> is<00:04:12.590> really<00:04:12.890> nice<00:04:13.220> it's<00:04:14.000> just

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
hair texture is really nice it's just

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.479 
hair texture is really nice it's just
the<00:04:14.660> same<00:04:14.870> as<00:04:15.049> this<00:04:15.260> one<00:04:15.320> it<00:04:15.769> feels<00:04:16.190> exactly

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the same as this one it feels exactly

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:19.180 
the same as this one it feels exactly
the<00:04:17.000> same<00:04:17.209> except<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:17.780> color<00:04:18.109> part<00:04:18.470> is<00:04:18.680> very

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
the same except the color part is very

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:24.190 
the same except the color part is very
assistant<00:04:20.000> it<00:04:20.120> matches<00:04:20.900> this<00:04:21.590> so<00:04:22.430> it's<00:04:23.210> it's

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
assistant it matches this so it's it's

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.180 
assistant it matches this so it's it's
the<00:04:24.260> same<00:04:24.590> difference<00:04:24.860> this<00:04:25.400> is<00:04:25.669> all<00:04:26.470> one<00:04:27.470> so

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
the same difference this is all one so

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:29.950 
the same difference this is all one so
that's<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.760> thing<00:04:28.940> so<00:04:29.090> I<00:04:29.120> guess<00:04:29.390> they<00:04:29.630> kind<00:04:29.900> of

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
that's the thing so I guess they kind of

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.870 
that's the thing so I guess they kind of
got<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.229> memo<00:04:30.590> I<00:04:30.860> guess<00:04:31.100> I<00:04:31.250> may<00:04:31.400> not<00:04:31.580> be<00:04:31.729> the

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
got the memo I guess I may not be the

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.020 
got the memo I guess I may not be the
only<00:04:32.030> one<00:04:32.390> that's<00:04:32.930> complaining<00:04:33.860> about<00:04:34.030> the

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
only one that's complaining about the

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.700 
only one that's complaining about the
dryness<00:04:35.510> at<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.780> bottom<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.200> the<00:04:36.289> weeks<00:04:36.470> that

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
dryness at the bottom of the weeks that

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.529 
dryness at the bottom of the weeks that
have<00:04:36.830> color<00:04:37.039> in<00:04:37.280> them<00:04:37.400> because<00:04:37.880> I<00:04:38.030> know<00:04:38.090> that

150 density or hundred into what how
about<00:06:00.289> I<00:06:00.740> think<00:06:01.280> this<00:06:01.430> is<00:06:01.550> 100%<00:06:02.030> density<00:06:02.780> let

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960 
about I think this is 100% density let

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:10.690 
about I think this is 100% density let
me<00:06:03.050> make<00:06:03.229> sure<00:06:06.520> it<00:06:07.520> is<00:06:07.669> not<00:06:07.820> saying<00:06:09.370> no<00:06:10.370> but<00:06:10.669> I

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:10.700 
me make sure it is not saying no but I

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:13.210 
me make sure it is not saying no but I
know<00:06:10.789> most<00:06:11.300> RPGs<00:06:11.599> show<00:06:12.080> wigs<00:06:12.349> are<00:06:12.590> 100%

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
know most RPGs show wigs are 100%

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.490 
know most RPGs show wigs are 100%
density<00:06:13.940> I<00:06:13.970> don't<00:06:14.240> really<00:06:14.450> think<00:06:14.630> this<00:06:14.810> is<00:06:14.870> 120

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
density I don't really think this is 120

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.250 
density I don't really think this is 120
because<00:06:15.860> it's<00:06:16.159> not<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.729> full<00:06:17.030> you<00:06:17.570> know<00:06:17.690> it's

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
because it's not that full you know it's

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.219 
because it's not that full you know it's
it's<00:06:18.710> full<00:06:19.010> but<00:06:19.280> it's<00:06:19.430> not<00:06:19.640> that<00:06:20.210> full<00:06:20.510> so<00:06:20.900> I

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:21.229 
it's full but it's not that full so I

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:24.880 
it's full but it's not that full so I
know<00:06:21.620> for<00:06:21.979> a<00:06:22.039> fact<00:06:22.190> that<00:06:22.370> I<00:06:22.870> know<00:06:23.870> what<00:06:24.320> 150

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
know for a fact that I know what 150

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:26.860 
know for a fact that I know what 150
density<00:06:25.280> feels<00:06:25.490> like<00:06:25.700> and<00:06:25.880> I<00:06:25.940> know<00:06:25.970> what<00:06:26.120> 125th

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:26.870 
density feels like and I know what 125th

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.120 
density feels like and I know what 125th
and<00:06:27.020> insidee<00:06:27.349> feels<00:06:27.560> like<00:06:27.740> and<00:06:27.890> that's<00:06:28.010> not

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:28.130 
and insidee feels like and that's not

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.839 
and insidee feels like and that's not
what<00:06:28.280> this<00:06:28.430> feels<00:06:28.640> like

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
what this feels like

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:32.440 
what this feels like
this<00:06:29.210> is<00:06:29.390> definitely<00:06:29.570> a<00:06:29.840> natural<00:06:31.180> density<00:06:32.180> you

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
this is definitely a natural density you

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:34.000 
this is definitely a natural density you
know<00:06:32.570> this<00:06:32.750> is<00:06:32.870> not<00:06:33.020> five<00:06:33.289> packs<00:06:33.770> of<00:06:33.950> hair

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:34.010 
know this is not five packs of hair

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:36.100 
know this is not five packs of hair
which<00:06:34.550> I'm<00:06:34.700> kind<00:06:34.909> of<00:06:35.000> getting<00:06:35.180> used<00:06:35.539> to<00:06:35.930> the

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:36.110 
which I'm kind of getting used to the

00:06:36.110 --> 00:06:38.210 
which I'm kind of getting used to the
natural<00:06:36.590> look<00:06:36.740> you<00:06:36.950> know<00:06:37.130> like<00:06:37.159> okay

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
natural look you know like okay

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.430 
natural look you know like okay
you're<00:06:38.430> done<00:06:38.670> you<00:06:39.390> know<00:06:39.510> you<00:06:40.020> don't<00:06:40.170> have<00:06:40.290> to

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:40.440 
you're done you know you don't have to

00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:45.020
