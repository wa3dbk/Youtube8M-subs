00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 or code people facilitated the day of 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.230
 today we are going to continue with our course 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.250
 of css today we will be 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:15.269
 talking about a property that is called 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.699
 out lines this property probably 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.189
 is not as important as others that 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.470
 let's see so the tutorial does not 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.250
 is going to be probably not so 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 long but good then what 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:35.380
 we have here we have two two things or a 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:39.339
 form with an input and a 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.410
 an html video 

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:43.339
 So what we are going to do is see that 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.149
 when we for example 

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:46.149
 we select 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.510
 our input or our label 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.280
 video 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.370
 let's see here I'm in the view in 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.500
 alive he selected it is marked with a 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.229
 blue line and if you take away the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.839
 border to your form because I want it 

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:06.659
 do pretty custom is not going to 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:08.909
 remove that blue line because that is not 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.580
 an edge is precisely the property 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.619
 classroom outline in operation then 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.619
 we are going to place a nest there is from here to 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.780
 to the form put my form 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.200
 and here in the css we are going to modify it my 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.200
 form 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:27.200
 and we will modify the input and we will 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.850
 to 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.650
 to refer to the property 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.650
 outline bellies 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:41.450
 outline receives different values ​​for 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.710
 example we can place diet that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.600
 precisely refers to the style 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:46.620
 of the line that will be placed on the outside 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.600
 of our form 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:52.500
 this gadget is going to place a line 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.600
 dotted dabul of a double line hayden 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 obviously he's going to hide it inset 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.230
 place to place it on the outside is going to 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.350
 place inside we can also 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:05.220
 change the color of our out line with 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.930
 the property outline color script what 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.320
 let's do for example to good here 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.790
 also to you for example is for 

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:15.420
 place it on the outside is the inverse of 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:18.120
 insert and the one that we usually use 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.980
 the one you saw on screen or the one you see 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.170
 com when you select a form 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:27.630
 it is solid solid such as at the edges 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.010
 we can also modify the thickness of 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.319
 our 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:33.120
 of our line because we are going to place it 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.200
 for example out 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:40.849
 well here online we will put solid 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.849
 here outline color 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.090
 here we are going to put 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:51.220
 this black 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.220
 alain white we also have 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.520
 what is going to do the thick we can 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.490
 place in pixels or with keywords 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.220
 that is medium medium without very thin 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.680
 tics is also a bit thin but 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.460
 good for example let's put the pixels and 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:11.880
 the out line offset and good no no what 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:14.010
 let's see this time but good 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.960
 these are the different parameters that 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.370
 we can place you online 

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:21.060
 as you can tell whether it is 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.040
 seeing there our line outside of 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.990
 our form this same online 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.340
 it can be applied to dips but we are 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.410
 doing with the input because 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.370
 what we usually do is place him 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.370
 one out line 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.480
 well when we already select the 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.970
 form no longer marks the line 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.090
 yellow in the case of chrome and I think that 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:44.250
 in safari blue is the line that puts you 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.270
 outside to the form when we 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:50.310
 We place a property online or 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.100
 least we do not deny it until here the 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:54.930
 tutorial today see you soon in the 

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.430
 background next to talk about you 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.760
 I send a greeting ariel hernandez many
