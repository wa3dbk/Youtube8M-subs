00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 I welcome you to a new episode 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.299
 my is the quickie video series today 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.069
 I have a real classic 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.830
 picked out and smart legend of zelda 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.960
 link's awakening to make it clear 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.030
 This is not about the original here 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.590
 remake for the gameboy color because there 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.170
 there are still a lot of differences 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 have some funny sex and secrets 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.650
 I found and I want now too 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.119
 do not talk around the bush 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.119
 That's why it can start immediately 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.960
 we start now with a little music 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:42.519
 when we are in the main menu and one 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.100
 we have to select the file 

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:46.870
 logically somehow if called 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.460
 we call them ourselves then one sounds 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.460
 version of the zelda main melody 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.880
 but if we new the file 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.880
 call then sounds the following melody 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.750
 but that works only in German 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.160
 version because it was a German 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.710
 translator who at this game 

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.390
 has worked the French and the 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:30.830
 Japanese version will ever be 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.960
 similar tuesday if we already at 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:35.090
 The topic of music is totally crass 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.650
 song of course I have one too 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.720
 detailed video about it 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:41.150
 Anyway, you can go to the day as a song 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.040
 which can be found in some games 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.110
 also here in link's awakening find 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.090
 you have to go out only in judicature 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.090
 and wait a few minutes 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.060
 By the way, you know that richard 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:06.130
 in general, this character comes from 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.479
 namely from a gameboy game which 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.030
 only appeared in japan 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.459
 it's called and excuses me now 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.870
 The Japanese language abuse Cairo 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:18.819
 praises american was after and the music 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.709
 listening to Richard's house is a remix 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:25.030
 from the main topic of the Japanese 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.709
 gameboy game richard is not 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.160
 the only character of the one cameo 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:32.769
 has characters like mario der 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.290
 chain dog kirby joschi and many more 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.120
 You can find more in the game 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.590
 to enumerate all but a lot 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.269
 that's why I'm taking too long 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.799
 just keep on sure you have 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.049
 already heard that in the shop some 

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:49.660
 Tricks can be used to save money 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.819
 the most effective money saving death is in the 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.260
 normal case the steal if you do 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:55.630
 you managed to steal something 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:02.230
 Will you play the whole game over one 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:04.389
 get nicknames and that the 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.510
 Highlight always comes to an end when 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:09.160
 I stole my link to this brother 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.660
 on one of the electric monsters scatters 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:16.239
 then come some funny sentences 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.690
 I never give you my juice 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:25.420
 without condoms any worries 

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:28.769
 or problems and stopped reset fans 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.940
 All small center know 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:32.380

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.569
 Hope you liked it if you still 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.470

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:37.090
 the comments 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.799
