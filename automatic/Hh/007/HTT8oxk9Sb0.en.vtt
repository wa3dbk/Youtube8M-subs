normal acoustic piano so you play it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.500 
normal acoustic piano so you play it
just<00:00:49.620> like<00:00:49.920> any<00:00:50.159> great<00:00:50.489> Yamaha<00:00:50.999> piano<00:00:51.210> should

just like any great Yamaha piano should

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.680 
just like any great Yamaha piano should
be<00:00:51.659> played<00:00:51.929> but<00:00:52.769> you<00:00:53.249> engage<00:00:53.670> by<00:00:54.329> pushing<00:00:54.569> down

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
be played but you engage by pushing down

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.229 
be played but you engage by pushing down
the<00:00:54.870> middle<00:00:55.019> pedal<00:00:55.440> a<00:00:55.679> rail<00:00:56.249> that<00:00:56.609> comes<00:00:57.030> up

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
the middle pedal a rail that comes up

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.419 
the middle pedal a rail that comes up
and<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.870> actual<00:00:58.139> Hammers<00:00:58.559> don't<00:00:58.889> strike<00:00:59.280> the

00:00:59.419 --> 00:00:59.429 
and the actual Hammers don't strike the

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.789 
and the actual Hammers don't strike the
strings<00:00:59.729> anymore<00:01:00.239> they<00:01:00.719> actually<00:01:01.139> strike<00:01:01.769> a

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:01.799 
strings anymore they actually strike a

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:04.820 
strings anymore they actually strike a
sensor<00:01:02.429> and<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.359> sensor<00:01:03.389> detects<00:01:04.350> how

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
sensor and the sensor detects how

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.190 
sensor and the sensor detects how
powerful<00:01:05.580> how<00:01:05.850> hard<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.480> strike<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.020> keys

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
powerful how hard you strike the keys

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.490 
powerful how hard you strike the keys
and<00:01:07.620> it<00:01:08.070> transmits<00:01:08.610> that<00:01:08.790> data<00:01:09.120> digitally<00:01:09.900> to

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
and it transmits that data digitally to

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.530 
and it transmits that data digitally to
a<00:01:10.530> sample<00:01:10.950> of<00:01:11.250> a<00:01:11.340> piano<00:01:11.670> sound<00:01:11.940> which<00:01:12.510> is

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
a sample of a piano sound which is

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:17.370 
a sample of a piano sound which is
stored<00:01:12.990> down<00:01:13.530> here<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.610> box

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.830 

and<00:01:17.560> then<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:18.340> see<00:01:18.610> and<00:01:18.939> and<00:01:19.270> then<00:01:19.570> what<00:01:19.689> will

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
and then I see and and then what will

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.929 
and then I see and and then what will
happen<00:01:19.869> it<00:01:20.320> recreates<00:01:21.070> the<00:01:21.340> sound<00:01:21.670> the

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
happen it recreates the sound the

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:25.140 
happen it recreates the sound the
performance<00:01:22.600> of<00:01:22.720> a<00:01:22.810> piano<00:01:23.080> but<00:01:23.950> no<00:01:24.790> sound

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
the silent system is very similar as you

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.890 
the silent system is very similar as you
go<00:02:36.430> up<00:02:36.459> just<00:02:37.239> one<00:02:37.450> thing

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
go up just one thing

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.330 
go up just one thing
the<00:02:38.049> piano<00:02:38.620> sound<00:02:38.920> that<00:02:39.100> you're<00:02:39.220> actually

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
playing when you're in silent mode is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.830 
playing when you're in silent mode is
actually<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.950> sample<00:02:42.640> of<00:02:42.790> Yamahas<00:02:43.299> concert

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:43.840 
actually a sample of Yamahas concert

actually a sample of Yamahas concert
grand<00:02:44.049> piano<00:02:44.109> so<00:02:45.010> actually<00:02:45.459> it's<00:02:45.609> a<00:02:45.700> good<00:02:45.940> way

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180
