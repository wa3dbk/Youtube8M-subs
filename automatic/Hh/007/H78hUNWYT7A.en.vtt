00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.760 
them to be effective and hopeful Oh is
there<00:04:17.330> people<00:04:17.750> even<00:04:17.959> I<00:04:18.169> don't<00:04:18.230> know<00:04:18.470> I<00:04:18.650> don't

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:18.770 
there people even I don't know I don't

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:20.050 
there people even I don't know I don't
know<00:04:18.919> I<00:04:18.980> know<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.220> there's<00:04:19.520> some<00:04:19.700> chopper<00:04:20.030> I

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
know I know that there's some chopper I

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.760 
know I know that there's some chopper I
think<00:04:20.330> 12<00:04:20.540> killstreak<00:04:20.989> that<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:21.620> get<00:04:21.739> to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
think 12 killstreak that you get to

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.230 
think 12 killstreak that you get to
control<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:22.340> basically<00:04:22.790> essentially<00:04:23.090> a

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
control so basically essentially a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.030 
control so basically essentially a
chopper<00:04:23.479> gunner<00:04:23.600> and<00:04:23.930> also<00:04:24.169> a<00:04:24.200> 15<00:04:24.620> killstreak

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
chopper gunner and also a 15 killstreak

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.790 
chopper gunner and also a 15 killstreak
I<00:04:25.160> think

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
I think

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.480 
I think
215<00:04:26.280> killstreak<00:04:26.840> where<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.930> pilot<00:04:28.379> and<00:04:28.620> shoot

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:29.490 
215 killstreak where you pilot and shoot

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.460 
215 killstreak where you pilot and shoot
down<00:04:29.729> and<00:04:30.240> you<00:04:30.509> know<00:04:30.599> rain<00:04:30.840> hell<00:04:31.080> on<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.349> enemy

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
down and you know rain hell on the enemy

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.939 
down and you know rain hell on the enemy
team<00:04:31.620> and<00:04:32.039> you<00:04:33.030> get<00:04:33.300> to<00:04:33.569> you<00:04:34.470> know<00:04:34.560> drop<00:04:34.710> like

00:04:34.939 --> 00:04:34.949 
team and you get to you know drop like

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:37.670 
team and you get to you know drop like
supplies<00:04:35.220> juggernauts<00:04:35.879> whatever<00:04:36.319> so<00:04:37.319> escort

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:37.680 
supplies juggernauts whatever so escort

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.219 
supplies juggernauts whatever so escort
airdrop<00:04:37.800> basically<00:04:38.400> so<00:04:39.360> I<00:04:39.569> don't<00:04:39.840> know<00:04:39.900> to<00:04:40.199> me

00:04:40.219 --> 00:04:40.229 
airdrop basically so I don't know to me

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.600 
airdrop basically so I don't know to me
they<00:04:40.650> just<00:04:40.830> didn't<00:04:41.069> think<00:04:41.099> about<00:04:41.340> those

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
they just didn't think about those

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:42.619 
they just didn't think about those
killstreaks<00:04:42.030> so<00:04:42.150> much<00:04:42.270> and<00:04:42.449> if<00:04:42.509> you're

00:04:42.619 --> 00:04:42.629 
killstreaks so much and if you're

00:04:42.629 --> 00:04:44.360 
killstreaks so much and if you're
wondering<00:04:42.659> about<00:04:43.080> that<00:04:43.229> spaz<00:04:43.620> moment<00:04:44.039> that<00:04:44.340> I

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
wondering about that spaz moment that I

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:46.939 
wondering about that spaz moment that I
had<00:04:44.580> with<00:04:44.759> the<00:04:45.169> with<00:04:46.169> javelin<00:04:46.650> I<00:04:46.710> actually
