00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 with people welcome 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.970
 I would say for the last time what it is 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.060
 one for all because good in this 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.760
 I'm doing video to announce 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:17.330
 that I'm not going to keep doing one for 

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.850
 I'm not going to keep recording videos 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.240
 I will leave alone for everything 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.090
 for many reasons they give a lot of work 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.950
 edition very much work search ideas 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.230
 make them look 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.090
 we just look for ideas others 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:38.830
 places we do not invent we do not 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:42.160
 we invent nothing and the truth is that good 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:45.400
 a little bit all this work all this 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:48.880
 of editing does not hurt me sometimes the 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.590
 response from people that you got it 

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.100
 from transferred to what 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:57.220
 the video is wrong 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 such a staff already did 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.760
 Y 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.150
 it's really a lot of work then 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.060
 seeing that there is not a very 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.680
 positive people 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.649
 the bad wave the bad comments 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.869
 then today take the decision to do 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:23.369
 this farewell not to leave it either 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:25.740
 you and stop being videos and well me 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.840
 I wanted to say goodbye to youtube, we are not going to 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.750
 continue to make videos unfortunately 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:34.350
 he's smarter he does not go through the file 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.350
 but we let him out 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:39.100
 Thank you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.770
 to lie to this video we're 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.420
 doing to do some ads 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.649
 important if it's an important announcement 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.049
 and I want to do it in a video on 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.210
 special not to mix the other things 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.830
 let's continue like this one for all I do not 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.479
 the comments matter the bad wave the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.890
 people I do not care about can follow 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.600
 putting I do not like that you do not like 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.630
 he continues criticizing that he wants 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.250
 criticize and the truth that I'm not interested 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.720
 I see the good vibes the good 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.789
 comments and we'll get there before 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.250

 it's obviously going to keep putting 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.220
 new ideas yes but let's do 

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:13.840
 relationships improving videos that 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.670
 throughout the previous year and everything that 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.750
 we have been doing a little 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.350
 confused 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:22.410
 some who do not understand each other well and 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.570
 then he knows how to record like for example the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.910
 paper curtain that generates so much 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:30.670
 controversy in the infinite mirror that 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.650
 missing the explanation and missing in 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:34.720
 improve it we will improve it I have 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.330
 including the materials to improve it 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.100
 for example the sun and shine of cornstarch 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:42.100
 we're going to improve it too 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.590
 fire the cell phone that was restricted to 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.510
 certain public at a certain age if also 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.490
 we will record it with the warnings 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.010
 adequate for youtube not to 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:52.890
 block that video so August we're going to 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.930
 be doing a lot of things 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.030
 repeated but just in order to 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.860
 improve it because as we already know 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.560
 we do not study edition we do not study anything 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:04.450
 what we did we just learn 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.090
 doing we learn by recording we learn 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.650
 editing and those things usually happen one 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.090

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.990
