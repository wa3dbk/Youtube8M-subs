00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:45.610 
beginning to the end of this disturbed

00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.000 
beginning to the end of this disturbed
boy's<00:06:45.880> life<00:06:46.090> the<00:06:46.450> murder<00:06:46.800> through<00:06:47.800> therapy

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:49.990 
sessions flashbacks and insights from

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.620 
sessions flashbacks and insights from
those<00:06:50.170> closest<00:06:50.800> to<00:06:50.830> the<00:06:51.130> case<00:06:51.330> so<00:06:52.330> kind<00:06:52.510> of

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:52.630 
those closest to the case so kind of

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:56.040 
those closest to the case so kind of
about<00:06:52.840> pure<00:06:53.590> evil<00:06:54.070> oh<00:06:54.280> ha<00:06:54.790> so<00:06:55.750> this<00:06:55.840> will<00:06:55.960> be

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
about pure evil oh ha so this will be

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.850 
about pure evil oh ha so this will be
interesting<00:06:56.260> very<00:06:56.620> kind<00:06:56.890> of<00:06:56.950> darker<00:06:57.300> not<00:06:58.300> even

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
interesting very kind of darker not even

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.250 
interesting very kind of darker not even
so<00:06:59.860> clearly<00:07:00.490> I<00:07:00.670> have<00:07:00.790> a<00:07:01.000> lot<00:07:01.360> of<00:07:01.390> reading<00:07:01.870> to<00:07:01.900> do

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:02.260 
so clearly I have a lot of reading to do

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:05.460 
so clearly I have a lot of reading to do
and<00:07:02.560> a<00:07:03.340> lot<00:07:03.400> more<00:07:03.670> I<00:07:04.180> probably<00:07:04.480> did<00:07:05.110> it<00:07:05.200> then

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470 
and a lot more I probably did it then

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.230 
and a lot more I probably did it then
think<00:07:05.920> this<00:07:06.160> through<00:07:06.190> when<00:07:06.700> I<00:07:06.730> entered<00:07:07.090> all

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:07.240 
think this through when I entered all

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.020 
think this through when I entered all
those<00:07:07.420> giveaways<00:07:07.920> which<00:07:08.920> is<00:07:09.160> probably<00:07:09.820> not

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:10.030 
those giveaways which is probably not

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.670 
those giveaways which is probably not
the<00:07:10.090> best<00:07:10.210> but<00:07:10.630> I<00:07:10.750> will<00:07:10.960> definitely<00:07:11.080> need<00:07:11.410> them

00:07:11.670 --> 00:07:11.680 
the best but I will definitely need them

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.470 
the best but I will definitely need them
and<00:07:11.890> also<00:07:12.100> like<00:07:12.640> I<00:07:12.820> was<00:07:13.030> thinking<00:07:13.300> about<00:07:13.330> the

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:13.480 
and also like I was thinking about the

00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:15.210 
and also like I was thinking about the
ones<00:07:13.660> that<00:07:13.780> aren't<00:07:14.050> autographed<00:07:14.470> and<00:07:15.160> the

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
ones that aren't autographed and the

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.440 
ones that aren't autographed and the
ones<00:07:15.370> that<00:07:15.460> aren't<00:07:15.790> like<00:07:15.910> on<00:07:16.060> corrected

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:16.450 
ones that aren't like on corrected

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.370 
ones that aren't like on corrected
proofs<00:07:16.660> I'll<00:07:16.810> probably<00:07:16.960> just<00:07:17.110> end<00:07:17.290> up

00:07:17.370 --> 00:07:17.380 
proofs I'll probably just end up

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.530 
proofs I'll probably just end up
