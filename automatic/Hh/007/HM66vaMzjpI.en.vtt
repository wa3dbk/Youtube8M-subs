a while Under Armour's are dirty

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:07.969 
a while Under Armour's are dirty
these<00:01:06.719> have<00:01:06.929> replaced<00:01:07.259> my<00:01:07.409> Under<00:01:07.679> Armour's

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
these have replaced my Under Armour's

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.190 
these have replaced my Under Armour's
for<00:01:08.219> two<00:01:08.369> reasons<00:01:08.759> one<00:01:09.329> reason<00:01:09.359> is<00:01:09.749> I<00:01:09.899> like<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
for two reasons one reason is I like the

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.980 
for two reasons one reason is I like the
ventilation<00:01:10.890> in<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.490> a<00:01:11.670> lot<00:01:12.149> better<00:01:12.390> and<00:01:12.689> for

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
ventilation in it a lot better and for

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.370 
ventilation in it a lot better and for
two<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.890> think<00:01:14.729> that<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.999> padding<00:01:15.509> is<00:01:15.689> useful

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
two I think that the padding is useful

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.340 
two I think that the padding is useful
when<00:01:16.619> you<00:01:16.649> get<00:01:16.950> hit<00:01:17.189> so<00:01:17.719> miss<00:01:18.719> far<00:01:18.929> as<00:01:19.109> the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
when you get hit so miss far as the

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.230 
when you get hit so miss far as the
compression<00:01:19.710> goes<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.340> it's<00:01:20.819> perfectly

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
compression goes it's it's perfectly

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.899 
compression goes it's it's perfectly
fine<00:01:21.509> like<00:01:21.960> I<00:01:22.079> said<00:01:22.259> it's<00:01:22.439> nothing<00:01:22.979> crazy<00:01:23.520> when

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
fine like I said it's nothing crazy when

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.429 
fine like I said it's nothing crazy when
you<00:01:24.030> compare<00:01:24.390> it<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> anything<00:01:24.810> else<00:01:25.140> as<00:01:25.409> far

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
you compare it to anything else as far

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.499 
you compare it to anything else as far
as<00:01:25.700> straight<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:26.789> compression<00:01:27.210> goes<00:01:27.329> as<00:01:27.420> it

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
as straight of compression goes as it

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.840 
as straight of compression goes as it
feels<00:01:27.689> about<00:01:27.869> the<00:01:28.020> same<00:01:28.369> one<00:01:29.369> thing<00:01:29.609> that<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
feels about the same one thing that I

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.870 
feels about the same one thing that I
that<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.479> have<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.810> get<00:01:30.960> used<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.729> was<00:01:32.729> just

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that I did have to get used to was just

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.980 
that I did have to get used to was just
the<00:01:33.030> interior<00:01:33.899> lining<00:01:34.170> of<00:01:35.009> all<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:35.549> pads

ones or not last time I bought
compression<00:02:31.470> gear<00:02:31.620> was<00:02:31.770> like<00:02:31.950> over<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.220> year

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
compression gear was like over a year

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.949 
compression gear was like over a year
ago<00:02:33.320> but<00:02:34.320> these<00:02:34.800> ones<00:02:35.010> have<00:02:35.160> air<00:02:35.580> flow

00:02:35.949 --> 00:02:35.959 
ago but these ones have air flow

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.449 
ago but these ones have air flow
basically<00:02:36.959> it's<00:02:37.080> just<00:02:37.110> perforated<00:02:37.740> sections

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
basically it's just perforated sections

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.760 
basically it's just perforated sections
and<00:02:38.700> these<00:02:38.820> are<00:02:38.970> mostly<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.770> pads

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
and these are mostly in the pads

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.560 
and these are mostly in the pads
themselves<00:02:41.100> because<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.910> pads<00:02:42.150> are<00:02:42.330> pretty

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
themselves because the pads are pretty

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.479 
themselves because the pads are pretty
thick<00:02:42.810> and<00:02:43.020> they<00:02:43.260> do<00:02:43.320> not<00:02:43.620> offer<00:02:43.890> air<00:02:44.250> flow

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:44.489 
thick and they do not offer air flow

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:47.630 
thick and they do not offer air flow
within<00:02:45.270> the<00:02:45.420> pad<00:02:45.720> itself<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.739> by<00:02:47.100> cutting<00:02:47.520> out

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
within the pad itself so by cutting out

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:50.390 
within the pad itself so by cutting out
sections<00:02:48.180> to<00:02:48.930> allow<00:02:49.290> some<00:02:49.590> air<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:50.040> kind<00:02:50.340> of

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
sections to allow some air to kind of

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.850 
sections to allow some air to kind of
get<00:02:50.580> in<00:02:50.730> there<00:02:50.850> and<00:02:51.440> you<00:02:52.440> know<00:02:52.530> it's<00:02:52.680> kind<00:02:52.830> of

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
get in there and you know it's kind of

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.550 
get in there and you know it's kind of
like<00:02:53.480> properly<00:02:54.480> wick<00:02:55.320> away<00:02:55.470> moisture

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
like properly wick away moisture

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.150 
like properly wick away moisture
naturally<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.700> think<00:02:57.420> that<00:02:57.510> that's<00:02:57.630> great<00:02:58.160> it's

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
naturally I think that that's great it's

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.350 
naturally I think that that's great it's
on<00:02:59.340> both<00:02:59.580> sides<00:02:59.910> and<00:03:01.280> then<00:03:02.280> the<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:02.760> one<00:03:03.030> or

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
on both sides and then the but one or

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:07.070 
on both sides and then the but one or
the<00:03:03.480> tailbone<00:03:03.930> is<00:03:04.140> not<00:03:04.980> ventilated<00:03:05.610> but<00:03:06.080> the

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the tailbone is not ventilated but the

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.009 
the tailbone is not ventilated but the
entire<00:03:07.700> area<00:03:08.700> there<00:03:09.120> is<00:03:09.269> ventilated<00:03:09.840> so<00:03:09.989> I

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
entire area there is ventilated so I

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.270 
entire area there is ventilated so I
don't<00:03:10.200> know<00:03:10.290> how<00:03:10.410> well<00:03:10.620> it's<00:03:10.800> going<00:03:10.980> to<00:03:11.040> show

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
don't know how well it's going to show

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.590 
don't know how well it's going to show
up<00:03:11.459> but<00:03:12.150> all<00:03:13.140> of<00:03:13.380> these<00:03:14.000> interior<00:03:15.000> panels<00:03:15.360> is

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
up but all of these interior panels is

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.800

all<00:03:16.320> this<00:03:16.440> micro<00:03:16.890> mesh<00:03:17.120> and<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.480> don't<00:03:18.630> know<00:03:18.720> if

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810

you can see my hand through there or not

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.940 
you can see my hand through there or not

everything out as it's happening is

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.420 
everything out as it's happening is
definitely<00:04:12.720> a<00:04:12.750> plus<00:04:13.079> so<00:04:13.739> the<00:04:13.980> other<00:04:14.130> feature

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430

definitely a plus so the other feature
is<00:04:14.579> pretty<00:04:15.239> much<00:04:15.390> that<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.870> main<00:04:16.049> purpose<00:04:16.739> of

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
is pretty much that the main purpose of

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.279 
is pretty much that the main purpose of
the<00:04:16.979> shorts<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.970> again<00:04:18.390> I<00:04:18.419> did<00:04:18.660> like<00:04:18.870> this<00:04:19.049> is

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
the shorts and again I did like this is

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.050 
the shorts and again I did like this is
the<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:19.859> padding<00:04:20.190> itself

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
the the padding itself

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.880 
the the padding itself
they<00:04:21.299> aren't<00:04:21.450> targeted<00:04:21.959> areas<00:04:22.320> as<00:04:22.590> I<00:04:22.770> was
