00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.779
 hello how welcome are you to my channel 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:25.970
 nothing today I want to show you how to do 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:28.820
 a strawberry and vanilla water with a base 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.759
 of horchata these waters are very sold 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:34.190
 in the tianguis in mexico in the df 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.989
 so today I want to show you here 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.540
 how to do them, they go there they are not 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:41.180
 following an exact recipe of a fact 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.670
 it's an idea of mine and well he knows very 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.350
 I hope you can do it right now 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.329
 we are already in this time that 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.580
 keeping autumn and autumn came 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.080
 but for the next year so that the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.350
 can make and have their fresh waters 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.000
 well I have here rice is rice already 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.610
 I have previously soaked what I put 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.750
 soak in water I always leave all the 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:04.730
 night and inside the refrigerator then 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.950
 and the curries 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:14.450
 here I also have milk is not liquid 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.010
 I have evaporated milk condensed milk and 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.600
 sugar 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:19.600
 the sugar because they already know is always 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.670
 taste 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.740
 so then it's basically a value 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:30.939
 flat but we're flavored with it 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:35.650
 strawberry flavor here I have it and here I have 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:37.630
 that strawberry extract and the red color 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.730
 for the vanilla we will be 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.460
 using vanilla extract to water 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:44.580
 horchata I put vanilla the only thing 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.840
 that we are going to be removing is the 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.300
 lemon zest the cascaritas of 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.830
 lemon and cinnamon then for 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.540
 vanilla vanilla extract 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:56.580
 vanilla and yellow coloring 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.160
 also later I will be doing the 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.630
 pop water is also rich 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.870
 water breaks which will start 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.870
 do 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.940
 which rice 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.600
 so then I say basically it's the 

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.880
 same procedure only that then 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.700
 each one with its different flavors and 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.300
 colors rice 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.300
 evaporated milk 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.530
 the condensed everything I'm going to liquefy here 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.530
 same 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.519
 if you do not want to do not put it condensed with 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.310
 only the thickness of the sugar but 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:38.560
 they will be richer with the 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.560
 condensed better sugar 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:47.019
 and I'm going to give you a quantity of water 

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:50.170
 but you can leave it according to 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:54.470
 their tastes and lowering them more if the 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:57.800
 they feel very concentrated of milk west 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:03:01.040
 leave it well concentrated well then everything 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.810
 this I'm going to liquefy the coloring and 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.440
 what is the flavoring the leaf I'm going to 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:10.040
 leave at the end then like this video what 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:12.560
 I am doing in two that is to say two 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.200
 different groups of waters then at 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.970
 I'll show you how nothing else 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.970
 add the coloring and flavoring 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.769
 well then I let myself grind pretty 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:27.590
 enough time the rice so that it does not 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.170
 we have to be passing several times 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:37.500
 by the player then when we put it 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:39.750
 there are always rice granites and that 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.880
 same granite we will go when another 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.890
 again until he leaves falling 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.040
 I tagged along as well and good until 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.860
 that is concentrated 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:53.040
 adding cinnamon and realities 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.430
 of our caritas of the world until here 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.950
 It would be an horchata water that is good 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:04.340
 better the quantities are varying a 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.340
 I already have it in my channel too 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.950
 look at this chubby is a little but I 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:15.020
 I will not liquefy it any more very little 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.950
 It also depends on your strainers is very 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:22.540
 fine your blender if it smells really good 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.540
 they will not be left almost nothing 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:30.010
 then all I did was dilute 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.050
 the conagua to reduce it with natural water 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.000
 rinse my glass and put it here then 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.550
 you this is the selection language 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.190
 how they want to concentrate 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:42.350
 of milk because they are adding more or 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:44.449
 less water as you like already 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:46.400
 we're just going to stir very well 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:48.710
 already by dividing the water into two parts to 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:53.389
 make it one of each flavor then here 

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:55.729
 I have to make the strawberry I'll 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:57.770
 add the coloring then you 

00:04:55.729 --> 00:04:59.479
 add the amount that you were 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:01.780
 I'm not going to give you a measure 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.780
 exact 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.680
 I am adding to this total amount 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:27.240
 I did concentrate will add it to 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.240
 10 cups of water 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:35.960
 it smells good, you can add some 

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:38.360
 slices of strawberry because of the water that 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.950
 it is also but only that they will have 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.310
 more careful because then they 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:45.680
 put up with a little less so if 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.600
 they want parliament or add waxes and 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:51.520
 apart from that it would be to know here 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:51.520
 we're also going to make the vanilla 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.360
 the coloring 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:06.990
 I return 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:10.560
 good the different types of waters 

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:15.180
 with the base 8 immediately added the 

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:17.700
 Vanilla extract smells good rich 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:21.210
 then 500 different know here 

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.850
 are the two rich waters of strawberry and 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.190
 vanilla either of the two very rich 

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:29.610
 and well, if the right is rich 

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:32.849
 imagine, here is the 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:36.929
 I'm going to serve 5 strawberry 

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:39.869
 really that those who have gone are not 

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:42.569
 of the df I do not know if in other states what 

00:06:39.869 --> 00:06:45.599
 also the custom but in the 

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:47.219
 Tianguis is almost by law that they have to 

00:06:45.599 --> 00:06:50.969
 be these posts with these waters 

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:53.309
 fresh and well good regularly 

00:06:50.969 --> 00:06:55.529
 they have in these glass containers 

00:06:53.309 --> 00:06:57.139
 but bigger is this little guy 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:06:59.770
 look 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:59.770
 so 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.400
 Well they crave a lot and more time 

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:06.440
 of heat truth 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.979
 and then on the other hand here I have the 

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:08.979
 vanilla 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:17.580
 and because other waters are very Mexican 

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:20.340
 there are many this vanilla 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.199
 Well, at first glance, it's going to look 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.759
 same as the one of breaks but with 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.340
 different taste the rhombus that also 

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:27.539
 It's very rich after I'll have them 

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.509
 Well, good friends, I hope you have them 

00:07:27.539 --> 00:07:32.849

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:41.060
 until next time
