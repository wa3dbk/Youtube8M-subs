00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.550
 his voice so we're a Soral TV 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:15.860
 we are a TV completely taste then 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.529
 what's this one because all 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.269
 the world did not tax this bah 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:21.019
 yeah we were given product in the 

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:23.419
 merchant etc 

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.159
 is that false arguments all that does not 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.050
 not actually you put your tv on it is 

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.819
 just independent here is to say 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.310
 we give everyone the floor 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:33.680
 but we do not put a chapel on top 

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:35.780
 of another you it's a little 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.010
 everyone's chapel in barsac east 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.170
 no yes maybe 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.060
 I can not do anything about it if it does not please 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.410
 please do not hear howe is maybe 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.570
 some constructive criticism 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.490
 it may not have come from knowing that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.780
 him there is a media that does not forget 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.390
 that there is a free electron 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.050
 oh yes to a host it's a fucking 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.610
 contract can miss but the guy there are some 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.770
 people who listen to him and watch him 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.470
 the fucking night which world is bad 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.150
 do nan but sometimes need not put 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.860
 things in place 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.409
 here are you saying as I saw them 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.909
 so here I am because I have 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.530
 the impression that in addition to this kamal which 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:10.880
 I call him back is full of 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.140
 people to step because there are full 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.300
 of people who have been cited in 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.670
 comments but we felt it 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.100
 there was a bit of animosity 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.090
 particular for me anyway a 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.340
 special mention 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.490
 so I'm asking you why I 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.480
 deserves as much respect as a fake name by 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.850
 the fact that 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.140
 must disturb somehow I have to 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.340
 to be the one who bothers the most 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.420
 finally it's true it's 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.860
 maybe the one who speaks the most in 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.940
 all the people mentioned have in any case 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.840
 the one who bothers the most 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:41.280
 when I say yes, that 's what coffee is 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.590
 but your tv then there I would like 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:47.100
 even put some truths back in place 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.080
 that this is the speech that we 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.290
 can not let go these crazy it's 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:54.570
 mad archie no one is atheist was 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.280
 built alone if there was a 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.350
 big rise of the audience has meta tv 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.430
 it is precisely because of this 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.710
 April 1st joke 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.270
 so we will not lie to each other 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.280
 see the numbers or look at them 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.780
 we are going to the posters and if it is necessary alain 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.460
 soral he came in the free antenna 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.490
 it was the last week of the season 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.900
 I recall a whole to know 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:13.670
 the hearing quite done anyway before 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.120
 that I know of 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:20.490
 then I do not want to mount the 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.530
 steps but there was the meta turn the 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.630
 meta tour during the summer we totaled 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.670
 almost a million and a few of sight 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.230
 over three weeks something that we 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.560
 did not see we obviously saw us 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.720
 seen climbing increased that's so we 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.700
 say yes ah bah no but everything is linked 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.290
 started everything is connected no we have fast and 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.300
 week ago we were very happy 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 to receive the well received if it was 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.430
 this was an emission show 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:46.020
 where isabelle bazin will tell 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.390
 but no, but you've been complacent with 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.060
 it all had to go in because 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:53.040
 precisely most of the times we see 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.330
 alain soral to be interviewed 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.400
 people are used to returning to him 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.200
 in to explain of entry one is not 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.280
 disagree with him that's for the isere 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.050
 to mark its limits 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.910
 I do not choose to be at the 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.840
 I have not chosen this land 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.910
 because precisely the angle of a 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.350
 pack of all so everyone all the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.900
 world the tax will stay there nan me I 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.790
 chosen instead to be relaxed with 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.620
 ask him all the questions and he 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.840
 did not scroll on any question 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.120
 like thursday 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.099
 already several times in broadcasts 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.830
 I fart right but those who follow 

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.450
 a regularly they do not know he does not 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:26.360
 doubt not finally there is that I play 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:30.890
 I think the most aficionados who had 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:33.470
 meaning to these churches and or in any case 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.420
 enough of two visions of things for 

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:39.010
 understand that all this is ridiculous 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.730
 jeanne is also never attacked him 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.890
 how to say frontally 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.860
 now yes genius of critics on 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:47.780
 the matter of communicating but have 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:50.090
 I right I liked reviews yes 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.470
 on the release omitted from albert ali who 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.660
 did not convince me at all, but I have the 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.400
 right to say how we would not 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.810
 plus the right therefore to express themselves and 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.459
 that's when we did not understand what is 

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.690
 for that I say I repeat it we are 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:01.819
 independent so yes 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.310
 not only do I express myself but I 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:05.420
 request not permission 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:07.790
 there will not be an authorization to 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.010
 ask to be able to express themselves especially 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.569
 on these topics there are public topics 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:13.099
 I do not talk about privacy that we 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:14.390
 not interested in the privacy of people do not 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:15.950
 we are not interested 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.870
 there we do not talk about public thing 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.810
 speak from a public point of view 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.130
 it's still an association that is 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:23.360
 publicly called into question a 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:24.260
 personality who is in question 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:26.960
 publicly 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.520
 so that's not a private matter 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.530
 I was a case of buttocks a 

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:32.180
 case that's so it's not a 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.080
 case that is a case that was 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.740
 on public place 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.740
 here
