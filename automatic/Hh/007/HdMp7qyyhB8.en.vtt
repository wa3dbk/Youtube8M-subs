think<00:05:43.450> for<00:05:43.660> just<00:05:43.720> a<00:05:43.960> moment<00:05:44.080> about<00:05:44.350> what<00:05:44.590> that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.370 
think for just a moment about what that
means<00:05:45.120> to<00:05:46.120> a<00:05:46.150> certain<00:05:46.510> extent<00:05:46.840> we<00:05:46.960> can<00:05:47.080> locate

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:47.380 
means to a certain extent we can locate
