I'm<00:01:19.520> you<00:01:20.520> know<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.670> understand<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.659> need<00:01:21.900> to<00:01:22.200> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
I'm you know I understand the need to to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
I'm you know I understand the need to to
use<00:01:23.159> animals<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.030> film<00:01:24.270> but<00:01:24.479> you<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.869> be

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
use animals and film but you have to be

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.050 
use animals and film but you have to be
really<00:01:25.439> really<00:01:25.470> extra<00:01:26.130> careful<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.759> I<00:01:26.820> think

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
really really extra careful and I think

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.859 
really really extra careful and I think
a<00:01:27.150> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.600> Wranglers<00:01:28.049> working<00:01:28.500> in<00:01:28.619> movies

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.170 
a lot of the Wranglers working in movies
there<00:01:30.869> should<00:01:31.140> be<00:01:31.320> a<00:01:31.350> checklist<00:01:32.100> on<00:01:32.700> that

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
there should be a checklist on that

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.300 
there should be a checklist on that
because<00:01:33.450> I've<00:01:33.780> seen<00:01:34.020> some<00:01:34.350> bad<00:01:34.530> behavior<00:01:34.740> but
