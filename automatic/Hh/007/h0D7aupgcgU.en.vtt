sadirah is the sadirah

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.140 
sadirah is the sadirah
when<00:01:25.259> she<00:01:25.500> first<00:01:25.770> had<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.280> mask<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.850> everyone

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
when she first had the mask and everyone

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.370 
when she first had the mask and everyone
was<00:01:27.270> kind<00:01:27.390> of<00:01:27.509> complaining<00:01:27.869> that<00:01:28.080> she<00:01:28.200> looked

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
was kind of complaining that she looked

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.140 
was kind of complaining that she looked
like<00:01:28.470> a<00:01:28.530> moral<00:01:28.920> Kombat<00:01:29.310> character<00:01:29.759> and<00:01:30.000> then

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
like a moral Kombat character and then

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.149 
like a moral Kombat character and then
soon<00:01:30.390> after<00:01:30.540> she<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.020> changed<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.530> not<00:01:31.829> having

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
soon after she was changed to not having

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
soon after she was changed to not having
a<00:01:32.250> mask<00:01:32.490> and<00:01:32.700> looking<00:01:33.000> like<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> way<00:01:33.390> she<00:01:33.540> does

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
a mask and looking like the way she does

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.410 
a mask and looking like the way she does
today<00:01:34.170> so<00:01:34.829> I<00:01:35.220> believe<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.939> means<00:01:36.180> that

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
today so I believe that this means that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.109 
today so I believe that this means that
the<00:01:36.600> Xbox<00:01:37.049> 360<00:01:37.710> version<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:38.340> probably<00:01:38.850> in

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
the Xbox 360 version was probably in

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.109 
the Xbox 360 version was probably in
development<00:01:39.780> up<00:01:40.170> until<00:01:40.619> September<00:01:41.159> of<00:01:41.189> 2013

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
development up until September of 2013

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.660 
development up until September of 2013
which<00:01:42.840> is<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> run<00:01:43.890> around<00:01:43.979> probably<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> same

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
which is a run around probably the same

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.999 
which is a run around probably the same
time<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.240> Xbox<00:01:45.630> Xbox<00:01:46.110> one<00:01:46.590> version<00:01:46.890> was

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
time that the Xbox Xbox one version was

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.350 
time that the Xbox Xbox one version was
being<00:01:47.189> developed<00:01:47.520> in<00:01:47.579> getting<00:01:47.790> close<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.240> its

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
being developed in getting close to its

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.749 
being developed in getting close to its
probably<00:01:48.930> final<00:01:49.409> stages<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.100> get<00:01:50.250> released<00:01:50.549> in

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
probably final stages to get released in

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.300 
probably final stages to get released in
November<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:52.200> it's<00:01:52.320> pretty<00:01:52.439> interesting<00:01:52.890> that

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
November so it's pretty interesting that

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.130 
November so it's pretty interesting that
this<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.909> actually<00:01:54.360> got<00:01:54.479> really<00:01:54.659> far<00:01:55.020> along

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this game actually got really far along

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
this game actually got really far along
and<00:01:55.470> then<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.770> scrapped<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.579> reason<00:01:56.909> these

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
and then was scrapped the reason these

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.700 
and then was scrapped the reason these
videos<00:01:57.390> are<00:01:57.540> popping<00:01:57.899> up<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.200> is<00:01:58.380> strictly

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
videos are popping up now is strictly

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.980 
videos are popping up now is strictly
for<00:01:58.979> archival<00:01:59.579> purposes<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.329> this<00:02:00.810> guy

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
for archival purposes and this guy

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
for archival purposes and this guy
actually<00:02:01.140> does<00:02:01.590> this<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> lot<00:02:02.189> of

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
actually does this with a lot of

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.859 
actually does this with a lot of
different<00:02:02.700> types<00:02:03.119> of<00:02:03.270> games<00:02:03.540> that<00:02:03.780> were

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
different types of games that were

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
different types of games that were
eventually<00:02:04.110> prototype<00:02:04.829> but<00:02:05.070> not<00:02:05.250> ever

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
eventually prototype but not ever

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
eventually prototype but not ever
release<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.329> that's<00:02:06.840> what<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.079> means<00:02:07.350> that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
release and that's what this means that

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.469 
release and that's what this means that
we're<00:02:07.799> not<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.099> be<00:02:08.250> seeing<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.879> Xbox

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
we're not going to be seeing the Xbox

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.440 
we're not going to be seeing the Xbox
360<00:02:10.110> version<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.619> killer<00:02:11.250> instinct<00:02:11.790> anytime

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
360 version of killer instinct anytime

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.089 
360 version of killer instinct anytime
soon<00:02:12.720> and<00:02:13.020> I<00:02:13.379> don't<00:02:13.410> think<00:02:13.680> we<00:02:13.950> would

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
soon and I don't think we would

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:16.220 
soon and I don't think we would
necessarily<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.970> to<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.629> biggest<00:02:15.959> reason

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
necessarily want to the biggest reason

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.780 
necessarily want to the biggest reason
we<00:02:16.349> would<00:02:16.620> want<00:02:16.860> to<00:02:16.920> is<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.400> of<00:02:17.459> expand

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
we would want to is to kind of expand

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.339 
we would want to is to kind of expand
the<00:02:17.910> player<00:02:18.120> base<00:02:18.300> because<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.989> hardest

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
the player base because the hardest

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.259 
the player base because the hardest
thing<00:02:19.470> about<00:02:19.500> playing<00:02:19.860> ki<00:02:20.129> or<00:02:20.550> getting<00:02:21.090> into

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
thing about playing ki or getting into

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.360 
thing about playing ki or getting into
ki<00:02:21.480> is<00:02:21.660> that<00:02:21.959> it's<00:02:22.110> on<00:02:22.230> the<00:02:22.349> Xbox<00:02:22.739> one<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.220> it's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
ki is that it's on the Xbox one and it's

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.220 
ki is that it's on the Xbox one and it's
expensive<00:02:23.730> and<00:02:24.090> arcade<00:02:24.390> sticks<00:02:24.629> or<00:02:24.750> expensive

etc etc if it was on the Xbox 360 and

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.540 
etc etc if it was on the Xbox 360 and
initially<00:02:28.379> developed<00:02:28.769> for<00:02:29.040> it<00:02:29.160> it'd<00:02:29.340> probably

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
initially developed for it it'd probably

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.250 
initially developed for it it'd probably
be<00:02:29.760> fantastic<00:02:30.480> and<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> might<00:02:30.959> be<00:02:30.989> a<00:02:31.080> much

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
be fantastic and it might be a much

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.930 
be fantastic and it might be a much
better<00:02:31.410> game<00:02:31.709> but<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.489> was<00:02:32.580> clearly

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
better game but it was clearly

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.759 
better game but it was clearly
downgraded<00:02:33.870> as<00:02:33.989> we<00:02:34.140> can<00:02:34.290> see<00:02:34.470> from<00:02:34.590> the

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
downgraded as we can see from the

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:36.559 
downgraded as we can see from the
screenshots<00:02:35.280> it's<00:02:35.550> definitely<00:02:36.239> not<00:02:36.360> the<00:02:36.420> same

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
screenshots it's definitely not the same

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:37.940 
screenshots it's definitely not the same
experience<00:02:37.290> that<00:02:37.349> we're<00:02:37.560> getting<00:02:37.650> or

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
give us a hint that these guys at one

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.330 
give us a hint that these guys at one
point<00:03:15.630> were<00:03:15.840> indeed<00:03:16.230> developing<00:03:16.920> this<00:03:17.100> game

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
point were indeed developing this game

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.250 
point were indeed developing this game
for<00:03:17.609> other<00:03:17.790> platforms<00:03:18.450> and<00:03:18.630> maybe<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:18.930> PC

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
for other platforms and maybe the PC

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.960 
for other platforms and maybe the PC
version<00:03:19.590> might<00:03:19.739> not<00:03:19.920> be<00:03:20.100> too<00:03:20.280> far<00:03:20.310> off<00:03:20.549> I

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
version might not be too far off I

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.759 
version might not be too far off I
certainly<00:03:21.569> hope<00:03:21.810> so<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:22.079> think<00:03:22.470> in<00:03:22.560> order<00:03:22.650> to

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
certainly hope so I think in order to

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.990 
certainly hope so I think in order to
get<00:03:22.889> the<00:03:22.980> player<00:03:23.190> base<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.400> little<00:03:23.609> bit<00:03:23.760> bigger

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
get the player base a little bit bigger

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.479 
get the player base a little bit bigger
it<00:03:24.239> would<00:03:24.389> be<00:03:24.540> great<00:03:24.750> to<00:03:24.900> see<00:03:25.019> a<00:03:25.049> PC<00:03:25.440> port<00:03:25.620> of<00:03:25.829> ki

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
it would be great to see a PC port of ki

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:27.979 
it would be great to see a PC port of ki
but<00:03:26.819> we<00:03:26.940> don't<00:03:27.180> know<00:03:27.359> if<00:03:27.510> it<00:03:27.660> would<00:03:27.750> share

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
but we don't know if it would share
