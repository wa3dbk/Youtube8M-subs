the problems is with the Internet is

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.189 
the problems is with the Internet is
that<00:00:17.070> you<00:00:17.160> can<00:00:17.279> only<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.640> so<00:00:17.910> much<00:00:17.970> and<00:00:18.570> I

that you can only do so much and I

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.470 
that you can only do so much and I
thought<00:00:20.130> that<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> needed<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.029> take<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.270> a<00:00:21.420> step

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
thought that I needed to take it a step

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.599 
thought that I needed to take it a step
further<00:00:21.720> so<00:00:22.470> what<00:00:22.650> I<00:00:22.680> did<00:00:22.980> was<00:00:23.160> I<00:00:23.310> put<00:00:23.519> together

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
further so what I did was I put together

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.259 
further so what I did was I put together
an<00:00:23.939> app<00:00:24.350> for<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.500> iPhone<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.310> iPad<00:00:26.849> and

an app for the iPhone and the iPad and
basically<00:00:28.170> what<00:00:28.500> this<00:00:28.680> app<00:00:28.890> does<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.670> call

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
basically what this app does is you call

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.900

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
someone's cell phone and it basically

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.299
