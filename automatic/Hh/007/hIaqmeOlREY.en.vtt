00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
thrown in and the hand-drawn cutscenes

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.270 
thrown in and the hand-drawn cutscenes
I'm<00:00:37.350> not<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.500> big<00:00:37.649> fan<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:37.980> hand-drawn

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
I'm not a big fan of the hand-drawn

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.979 
I'm not a big fan of the hand-drawn
cutscenes<00:00:38.670> I<00:00:38.820> find<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.059> they<00:00:39.239> lose<00:00:39.960> some

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
cutscenes I find that they lose some

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.410 
cutscenes I find that they lose some
frames<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> animation<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:41.969> tends

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
frames in the animation and that tends

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.010 
frames in the animation and that tends
to<00:00:42.540> be<00:00:42.629> a<00:00:42.660> problem<00:00:43.250> just<00:00:44.250> because<00:00:44.719> why<00:00:45.719> throw

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
to be a problem just because why throw

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.450 
to be a problem just because why throw
in<00:00:46.200> hand<00:00:46.410> drawn<00:00:46.559> animation<00:00:46.590> if<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
in hand drawn animation if it's going to

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.299 
in hand drawn animation if it's going to
be<00:00:47.520> sloppy<00:00:47.760> looking<00:00:48.110> that's<00:00:49.110> just<00:00:49.379> kind<00:00:50.129> of<00:00:50.160> a

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
be sloppy looking that's just kind of a

be sloppy looking that's just kind of a
avoidable<00:00:50.820> i<00:00:51.000> have<00:00:51.180> any<00:00:51.329> way<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.629> animation

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.199 
I really enjoyed this just because it's
a<00:03:13.720> little<00:03:13.900> bit<00:03:13.989> innovative<00:03:14.409> and<00:03:15.209> definitely

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
a little bit innovative and definitely

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.360 
a little bit innovative and definitely
as<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:17.109> once<00:03:17.530> they<00:03:17.620> pushing<00:03:17.799> the<00:03:17.980> boundaries<00:03:18.250> of

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
as I once they pushing the boundaries of

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.610 
as I once they pushing the boundaries of
Android<00:03:19.030> but<00:03:19.180> it's<00:03:19.269> at<00:03:19.389> least<00:03:19.470> looking<00:03:20.470> at

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
Android but it's at least looking at

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.860 
Android but it's at least looking at
games<00:03:20.889> in<00:03:21.280> a<00:03:21.489> different<00:03:22.269> way<00:03:22.389> I<00:03:22.419> know<00:03:22.660> that

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
games in a different way I know that

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.190 
games in a different way I know that
cloud<00:03:23.079> saves<00:03:23.380> aren't<00:03:23.620> exactly<00:03:23.859> a<00:03:24.069> huge<00:03:24.819> deal

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
cloud saves aren't exactly a huge deal

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.990 
cloud saves aren't exactly a huge deal
but<00:03:26.200> putting<00:03:26.410> them<00:03:26.560> on<00:03:26.650> dropbox<00:03:27.160> on<00:03:27.639> kind<00:03:27.880> of<00:03:27.910> a

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
but putting them on dropbox on kind of a

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.559 
but putting them on dropbox on kind of a
public<00:03:28.620> cloud<00:03:29.620> is<00:03:30.040> definitely<00:03:30.730> a<00:03:30.760> step<00:03:30.879> up<00:03:30.940> so

00:03:31.559 --> 00:03:31.569 
public cloud is definitely a step up so

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:34.349 
public cloud is definitely a step up so
i<00:03:31.599> can<00:03:32.730> in<00:03:33.730> terms<00:03:33.940> of<00:03:34.060> whether<00:03:34.209> i<00:03:34.269> would

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:34.359 
i can in terms of whether i would

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:35.670 
i can in terms of whether i would
recommend<00:03:34.720> this<00:03:34.810> game<00:03:34.900> or<00:03:35.109> not<00:03:35.139> i'm<00:03:35.410> not<00:03:35.560> sure

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
recommend this game or not i'm not sure

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.619 
recommend this game or not i'm not sure
if<00:03:35.769> I<00:03:35.859> would<00:03:35.919> just<00:03:36.849> because<00:03:37.060> I'm<00:03:37.209> not<00:03:37.389> a<00:03:37.419> big

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
if I would just because I'm not a big
