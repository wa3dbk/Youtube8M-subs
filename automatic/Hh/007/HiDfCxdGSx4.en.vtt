00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:05.910

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.560
 with its equally elegant design 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.970
 that the original magic empa two 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.230
 utilities that we can do without 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.120
 the first is very simple but above all 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.559
 indispensable to enlighten you when you 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.759
 read before you sleep you are on a 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.139
 computer looking for the 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.940
 next product you are going to buy 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.320
 the light is white natural well 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 oriented to not burst the 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.410
 old and the life of the ampoulÃ© 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.640
 2.50 miller we are not going to get into 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.170
 the technical details that no one 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.490
 understands but know that the light is 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.810
 powerful enough to work or do 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.279
 all the tasks you want for 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.380
 interesting this lamp the brightness 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.149
 adjustable more or less precisely in 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.860
 pressing the touch button 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.180
 it will decrease or increase to a 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 relaxation it must of course be 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.570
 plugged into an electrical outlet or 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.670
 usb port to run his second 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.440
 utility that makes its particularity is 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.550
 induction charging so wireless 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.110
 it must of course that your phone 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.700
 be compatible with induction more 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.989
 precisely the chi norm for those who 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.309
 are not there is a solution that 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.570
 will see a little bit later I talk about 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.949
 phone because that's the use that 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.239
 I have but it will work of course 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.620
 with any device that is 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.270
 compatible with this standard then the 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.280
 standard if we have already talked about it during the 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.140
 video of the induction clock the magic loc 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.850
 here is a quick course on this standard 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.320
 many benefits it's a way to 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.049
 wireless charging that works through 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.010
 two actors the transmitter and the receiver 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:09.780
 the transmitter and in this case the lamp 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.860
 and the receiver your smartphone in 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.510
 each of these actors will find a 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.680
 copper coil that will transmit from 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.030
 energy when they will face 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.470
 face for smartphones that does not have 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 not this feature as in my 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.500
 case with the iphone litis of schools 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.210
 specialized or reels of 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.530
 Copper under your current rating 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.820
 to make it compatible 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.229
 if this is your case you will find your 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.520
 happiness in the description you will not have 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.470
 so that to put your device on the 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.000
 magic lamp update it's in charge it's 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.439
 as simple as that, the more I own two 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.180
 products of the range magic plus I 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.530
 hate cables it really offers a 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.610
 comfort of use to have only 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.900
 ask are three tons for the 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.200
 recharge and wait until the next day 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.579
 morning 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.259
 I've been using it for a few months 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.759
 and I have no desire to return to 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.110
 cable and when I'm home my 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.430
 iphone is constantly loaded because I 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.140
 has several induction products 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.940
 for the different rooms of the house 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.350
 but if you already buy one you 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:50.460
 will fall in love it's exactly 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.810
 the same principle as waking that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.880
 I had presented when your 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.960
 smartphone is 100% looking cutting 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.490
 until they leave the 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.810
 battery result in the early morning you 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.130
 have a charged battery but that is not 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.420
 not damaged by overload 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.680
 of course it's slower than if 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.420
 your device was plugged into a jack 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.460
 sector directly but the loss was 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.479
 quite light up to 30% more 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.130
 if you still want to connect 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.780
 your device or another a usb port 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.220
 hidden behind the base I do not have 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.090
 found of real inconvenience or 2d 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 times the magic lamp 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.489
 she does very well everything that is 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.510
 asks the only problem that some 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.069
 could have it's this light 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.450
 blue that activates when energy 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.070
 and transmitted it can be disturbing 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.390
 but used to be surrounded by 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.890
 all kinds of light there are others 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.580
 devices when I sleep it did not land me 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.840
