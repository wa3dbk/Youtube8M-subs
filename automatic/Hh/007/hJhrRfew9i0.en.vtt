quite a cool little tweaking some nice
functionality<00:02:03.869> to<00:02:04.229> it<00:02:04.259> but<00:02:04.920> I'm<00:02:05.610> kind<00:02:05.939> of

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
functionality to it but I'm kind of

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
functionality to it but I'm kind of
enjoying<00:02:06.149> just<00:02:06.659> having<00:02:06.990> no<00:02:07.350> labels<00:02:08.160> actually

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

enjoying just having no labels actually
I<00:02:08.459> haven't<00:02:08.729> done<00:02:08.789> that<00:02:08.849> for<00:02:08.970> a<00:02:09.119> while<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.420> I

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
I haven't done that for a while and I

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
I haven't done that for a while and I
forgot<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.840> good<00:02:09.989> that<00:02:10.110> was<00:02:10.259> so<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.679> quite<00:02:11.069> like

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
forgot how good that was so I quite like

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.160 
forgot how good that was so I quite like
this<00:02:11.370> whole<00:02:11.580> setup<00:02:11.819> but<00:02:12.390> anyway<00:02:12.690> we'll<00:02:12.900> just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
this whole setup but anyway we'll just

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.490 
this whole setup but anyway we'll just
jump<00:02:13.319> in

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
jump in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.170 
jump in
this<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:13.680> charge<00:02:14.160> label<00:02:14.340> tweaked<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:15.030> we'll

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
this I charge label tweaked and we'll

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.820 
this I charge label tweaked and we'll
show<00:02:15.330> you<00:02:15.360> what<00:02:15.630> happens<00:02:16.020> when<00:02:16.260> we<00:02:16.380> enable

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
show you what happens when we enable

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
show you what happens when we enable
this<00:02:16.980> so<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:18.180> will<00:02:18.330> need<00:02:18.540> to<00:02:18.660> enable<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.170> and

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
this so you will need to enable it and

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.100 
this so you will need to enable it and
every<00:02:19.530> spring<00:02:19.830> which<00:02:19.980> I've<00:02:20.100> just<00:02:20.250> done<00:02:21.110> jump

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
into this now I haven't looked at kind

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.080 
into this now I haven't looked at kind
of<00:02:25.470> many<00:02:25.770> of<00:02:25.950> the<00:02:26.100> features<00:02:26.520> of<00:02:26.700> this<00:02:26.910> i<00:02:27.060> just

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
of many of the features of this i just

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.020 
of many of the features of this i just
looked<00:02:27.420> at<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.750> main<00:02:27.960> one<00:02:28.200> which<00:02:28.320> is<00:02:28.350> this

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
looked at the main one which is this

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.360 
looked at the main one which is this
live<00:02:30.030> mode<00:02:30.360> so<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.020> if<00:02:31.470> we<00:02:31.590> go<00:02:31.800> ahead<00:02:32.010> click

and<00:02:35.459> you'll<00:02:35.550> see<00:02:35.760> that<00:02:35.970> this<00:02:36.690> happens

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and you'll see that this happens

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.560 
and you'll see that this happens
basically<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:39.090> then<00:02:39.209> if<00:02:39.270> you<00:02:39.330> can<00:02:39.450> see<00:02:39.540> that

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
basically and then if you can see that

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.720 
basically and then if you can see that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
quite so well on camera but basically

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.360 
quite so well on camera but basically
each<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.270> the<00:02:42.390> little<00:02:43.140> tiles<00:02:43.800> underneath<00:02:43.950> each

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
each of the little tiles underneath each

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.220 
each of the little tiles underneath each
apple<00:02:44.610> kind<00:02:44.940> of<00:02:45.090> obviously<00:02:45.600> switching<00:02:46.050> colors

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
apple kind of obviously switching colors

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.470 
apple kind of obviously switching colors
between<00:02:46.950> each<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.520> and<00:02:47.820> that's<00:02:48.239> quite<00:02:48.390> a

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
between each other and that's quite a

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.910 
between each other and that's quite a
cool<00:02:48.660> little<00:02:48.780> feature<00:02:48.900> probably<00:02:49.530> not<00:02:49.680> great

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
cool little feature probably not great

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.710

yeah<00:03:10.770> this<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.100> a<00:03:11.130> pate<00:03:11.550> week<00:03:11.820> I<00:03:11.970> think<00:03:12.180> and<00:03:12.770> I

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 
yeah this is a pate week I think and I

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:15.590 
yeah this is a pate week I think and I
think<00:03:14.190> it's<00:03:14.280> probably<00:03:14.370> worth<00:03:14.940> the<00:03:15.120> price<00:03:15.300> tag

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
think it's probably worth the price tag

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.710 
think it's probably worth the price tag
over<00:03:15.950> I<00:03:16.950> think<00:03:17.250> it's<00:03:17.400> 199<00:03:18.060> something<00:03:18.510> like

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
over I think it's 199 something like

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.250 
over I think it's 199 something like
that<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.950> just<00:03:20.130> do<00:03:20.280> this<00:03:20.340> home<00:03:20.730> screen<00:03:21.260> so

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:22.260 
that so just do this home screen so

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.050 
that so just do this home screen so
you'll<00:03:22.380> be<00:03:22.440> able<00:03:22.470> to<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.739> that<00:03:22.860> I<00:03:22.920> see<00:03:23.790> that<00:03:23.820> no

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
you'll be able to see that I see that no

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.900 
you'll be able to see that I see that no
better<00:03:24.360> now<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.690> this<00:03:25.170> functionality<00:03:25.980> makes

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
better now so this functionality makes

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.060 
better now so this functionality makes
it<00:03:27.090> all<00:03:27.180> sort<00:03:27.390> of<00:03:27.450> change<00:03:27.690> in<00:03:28.170> between<00:03:29.040> each

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
it all sort of change in between each

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.130 
it all sort of change in between each
other<00:03:29.340> there<00:03:29.519> we'll<00:03:29.790> go<00:03:29.940> ahead<00:03:30.060> into<00:03:30.570> back

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
other there we'll go ahead into back

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.910 
other there we'll go ahead into back
into<00:03:31.380> the<00:03:31.470> tweak<00:03:31.709> here<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:33.560> you<00:03:34.560> have<00:03:34.709> sort<00:03:34.890> of

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
into the tweak here and you have sort of

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.490 
into the tweak here and you have sort of
different<00:03:35.280> ones<00:03:35.430> so<00:03:35.519> if<00:03:35.700> we<00:03:35.850> go<00:03:36.290> changing<00:03:37.290> all

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
different ones so if we go changing all

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:39.860 
different ones so if we go changing all
the<00:03:37.739> new<00:03:38.130> sort<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:38.489> fades<00:03:38.790> between<00:03:39.330> them<00:03:39.630> so

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
the new sort of fades between them so

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.300 
the new sort of fades between them so
awesome<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.590> black<00:03:40.769> you<00:03:40.890> can't<00:03:41.100> really<00:03:41.190> see

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
awesome it's black you can't really see

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.850 
awesome it's black you can't really see
it<00:03:41.459> but<00:03:41.700> you<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.120> see<00:03:42.299> it's<00:03:42.510> off<00:03:42.720> not<00:03:43.650> so<00:03:43.799> much

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
it but you can see it's off not so much

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.080 
it but you can see it's off not so much
fades<00:03:44.190> that<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.430> can<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.730> it<00:03:44.850> sort<00:03:45.060> of

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
fades that you can see it sort of

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.640 
fades that you can see it sort of
jumping<00:03:45.570> in<00:03:45.690> between<00:03:45.959> colors<00:03:46.320> but<00:03:46.470> that's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
jumping in between colors but that's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
jumping in between colors but that's
kind<00:03:46.890> of<00:03:46.920> a<00:03:47.010> nice<00:03:47.190> one<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.540> have<00:03:48.690> sort

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
kind of a nice one so if you have sort

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.240 
kind of a nice one so if you have sort
of<00:03:48.930> a<00:03:49.049> plain<00:03:49.290> background<00:03:49.470> where<00:03:49.829> you<00:03:49.920> can<00:03:50.040> see

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
of a plain background where you can see

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.440 
of a plain background where you can see
all<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.489> different<00:03:50.579> colors<00:03:51.060> and<00:03:51.090> I

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
all the different colors and I

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.380 
all the different colors and I
definitely<00:03:51.959> recommend<00:03:52.260> that<00:03:52.709> but<00:03:53.340> last<00:03:54.180> not

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
definitely recommend that but last not

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.729 
definitely recommend that but last not
least<00:03:54.480> we'll<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.810> quickly<00:03:54.900> go<00:03:55.290> through<00:03:55.440> some

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
least we'll just quickly go through some

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.289 
least we'll just quickly go through some
of<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.890> other<00:03:56.010> one<00:03:56.130> so<00:03:56.310> or<00:03:56.700> so<00:03:56.850> there's<00:03:57.000> a<00:03:57.090> few

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
of the other one so or so there's a few

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.810 
of the other one so or so there's a few
different<00:03:57.450> life<00:03:58.320> modes<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.130> you<00:03:59.250> can<00:03:59.519> choose

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
different life modes that you can choose

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.140 
different life modes that you can choose
from<00:04:00.260> you<00:04:01.260> can<00:04:01.470> obviously<00:04:01.850> disable<00:04:02.850> the<00:04:02.940> live

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
from you can obviously disable the live

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.420 
from you can obviously disable the live
mode<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.750> then<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.110> choose<00:04:04.440> a<00:04:04.500> color<00:04:05.070> for

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
mode and then just choose a color for

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.449 
mode and then just choose a color for
what<00:04:05.820> you<00:04:05.970> want<00:04:06.060> the<00:04:06.239> icon<00:04:06.660> so<00:04:07.070> you<00:04:08.070> have<00:04:08.280> to

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
what you want the icon so you have to

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.970 
what you want the icon so you have to
have<00:04:08.579> these<00:04:08.700> rgba<00:04:09.590> sliders<00:04:10.590> here<00:04:10.769> where<00:04:10.920> you

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
have these rgba sliders here where you

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.199 
have these rgba sliders here where you
can<00:04:11.100> just<00:04:11.160> choose<00:04:11.489> whatever<00:04:11.700> color<00:04:11.850> you<00:04:12.180> want

and<00:04:12.540> nice<00:04:13.079> which<00:04:13.799> is<00:04:14.070> you<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.820> dock

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
and nice which is you have the dock

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:16.490 
and nice which is you have the dock
icons<00:04:15.450> which<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.720> separate<00:04:16.079> sources<00:04:16.410> you

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
icons which is separate sources you

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:17.900 
icons which is separate sources you
could<00:04:16.650> have<00:04:16.769> your<00:04:16.859> dock<00:04:17.070> icons<00:04:17.489> a<00:04:17.579> different

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
could have your dock icons a different

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.670 
could have your dock icons a different
colour<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.329> the<00:04:18.359> the<00:04:18.510> rest<00:04:19.169> of<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.440> spring

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:19.680 
colour to the the rest of the spring

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.500 
colour to the the rest of the spring
world<00:04:19.890> which<00:04:20.010> is<00:04:20.040> nice<00:04:20.340> and<00:04:20.579> then<00:04:21.060> also<00:04:21.329> you

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:21.510 
world which is nice and then also you

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:23.600 
world which is nice and then also you
can<00:04:21.870> go<00:04:22.020> ahead<00:04:22.140> and<00:04:22.289> choose<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.740> font<00:04:22.919> size<00:04:23.220> as

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
can go ahead and choose the font size as

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.660 
can go ahead and choose the font size as
well<00:04:23.640> so<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.570> can<00:04:24.810> make<00:04:25.080> it<00:04:25.260> slightly<00:04:25.440> bigger

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:26.670 
well so you can make it slightly bigger

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.400 
well so you can make it slightly bigger
and<00:04:26.760> i<00:04:27.150> need<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.540> actually<00:04:27.690> enable<00:04:28.350> this<00:04:28.710> first

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
and i need to actually enable this first

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:33.290 
and i need to actually enable this first
so<00:04:31.410> hopefully<00:04:31.680> this<00:04:31.890> will<00:04:32.070> make<00:04:32.430> the<00:04:32.580> text<00:04:32.910> see

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
so hopefully this will make the text see

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.270 
so hopefully this will make the text see
there<00:04:33.540> so<00:04:34.110> now<00:04:34.320> the<00:04:34.380> text<00:04:34.770> is<00:04:34.890> slightly<00:04:35.100> bigger

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
there so now the text is slightly bigger

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.680 
there so now the text is slightly bigger
and<00:04:35.430> we'll<00:04:35.520> just<00:04:35.580> wait<00:04:35.730> fat<00:04:35.970> to<00:04:36.120> come<00:04:36.420> for<00:04:36.600> you

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.870 
and we'll just wait fat to come for you
so<00:04:36.840> you<00:04:37.710> can<00:04:37.740> see<00:04:37.920> there<00:04:38.160> which<00:04:38.550> is<00:04:38.580> kind<00:04:38.850> of

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
so you can see there which is kind of

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.450 
so you can see there which is kind of
nice<00:04:39.000> if<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.390> have<00:04:39.570> short<00:04:39.990> named<00:04:40.740> icons<00:04:41.310> and
