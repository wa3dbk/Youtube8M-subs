 and you always knew that you are going to dedicate yourself to sport in this profession 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.050
 not really pd I had the luck of winning colombia gral sport is one of 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.500
 the 12 or 13 years that narrated imaginary parties there in my room with 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.630
 a tennis ball that says against a wall 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:00.180
 and if lanús and the eleventh in the past by murillo located narrate them 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.810
 but it really gives me the race I was about to finish cutting 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.399
 teletypes that you no longer know if what was exceeded in it the machinery from before 

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:08.880
 t 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.969
 in an economy property I stayed economically I do not know anything at all 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.219
 I know I had the luck of wind I fell sports that was what I wanted 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.990
 but reality that you never know with certainty 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.820
 bernotat wanted to do another type of journalism 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.650
 the not good 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.030
 ricky wants to make it appear that suddenly you see some you go out there 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.820
 James scored we're going to win some international stuff 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.140
 what do you synthesize 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.460
 what would I do if I were in that place 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.000
 I'd love to keep shooting crime and and discover trouble but 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.980
 max company mendoza come and go be much more 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:45.020
 focused interest in sport 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.020
 He said at that moment in your career that you remember with more emotion 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.600
 emotion 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.450
 that there are two types of woman reads gave me taste is judging at least for 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.010
 me one is the personal 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.770
 illia and without a doubt it is 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.920
 e when I got into the radio when they told me to go when I saw in the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.370
 lists that you have approved 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.040
 the examination of practices and of a thing Saturday in the terrarium of the commune pg 

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.919
 workshop 

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:11.409
 that meant came into being 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.219
 per hundred and then the collective programming that is to work well 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:18.549
 done because it has been passed many times exceeded for example in Barcelona 92 ​​and 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.769
 certainly the last eurocopa 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.009
 but not only morally your athletes other equipment but because 

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:28.009
 eel cimalsa health at work and ask what he sees rewarded 

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.689
 this argument a little unpleasant 

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:33.080
 always a few 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:37.110
 for place as I have a dinner the selective one I forget normally but 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.199
 yes 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.509
 Pressures from some president of a soccer team 

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:44.329
 even after the eye 

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:48.109
 e fails everything fails when I fado only two points you like to have in which 

00:02:48.109 --> 00:02:51.109
 less depends on one casilda of the microphone 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.249
 your trip passes 

00:02:53.249 --> 00:02:57.479
 and which party was remembered with more affection now but some the eurocopa 

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.939
 that I thought I was going to die without seeing Spain win anything 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.019
 nothing important, however, for men 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.879
 i do not know for me and him 

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:08.229
 the prater of vienna the outbreak of two of cossío for the eurocopa of 

00:03:09.179 --> 00:03:12.329
 As a garden of my house I had to go to rooms to semis 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.290
 and at the end although it touched I had the luck of anger for those three games in a row 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.769
 see how Spain earned a living 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:21.819
 of not believing less they managed to see map to enjoy the net profit of the final 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.419
 I had fun enjoying to relax from the line to throw we're 

00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.439
 doing it well araya relax and think it's okay one thing 

00:03:29.939 --> 00:03:31.639
 we want to live again 

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.349
 or maybe themselves 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:36.399
 although player of the current Spanish league would be left 

00:03:36.399 --> 00:03:38.700
 foreign percent 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:41.910
 I would have doubts between forlán ni and messi 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.180
 is that I really like everyone for one thing one to play soccer and 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.929
 another to make plays 

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:49.799
 i 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:55.409
 Spaniards between iniesta xavi and puyol casillas and a very particular stone 

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:58.149
 how good do people like to see my feet 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:04:00.539
 I think I like more of silva forests 

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:03.019
 I know that it is not up to the others 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.469
 enter history or irregularity 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:07.539
 or in palmares 

00:04:07.539 --> 00:04:09.719
 the missive of the córdoba cf 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.219
 the repera 

00:04:11.219 --> 00:04:14.509
 it is inevitable that colors come out in this profession 

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:20.769
 so for increases to the front me the day I go to 22 or 23 years in this 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.490
 when you start you're very from a team, that's why you like sports 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:29.360
 when you meet the dedes team terrace is not perfect is imbecile the 3d 

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.539
 the story is already working hard 

00:04:32.539 --> 00:04:35.940
 and in the end ends up being more friends than teams 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.550
 I want to say that if you get along very well with a player who was there in the 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.840
 lightning with another you started the player finished today 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:43.199
 said variable 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.729
 is nervous about doing well at Valladolid 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:49.419
 I'm nervous because a coach who is now directing is doing well 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.340
 keep sticking past sad Swedish 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.569
 as a commentator and worrying according to him 

00:04:53.569 --> 00:04:57.409
 for his pile of stories so in the end the most of team jedec of ate 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:04:59.199
 friends that colors 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.199
 and it's always because it's more of a profession an emotion 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.370
 I think it has to do 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:07.039
 with the two things is that 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.020
 a profession can not kill yourself physically 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.350
 at least be provided by pivot on radios bob company jet do something 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.629
 similar and with time on television it is also 

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:20.569
 therefore, before the microphone with the responsibility of speaking to the 

00:05:20.569 --> 00:05:23.409
 many or few teeth that come the station that in this case are many for 

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:24.930
 ahead because it's going to be 

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:28.130
 but if you will be happy consolidates knowing that I am in the chair and in front of the same micro 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:32.830
 in which before people have been quest history of the radio and by the 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.970
 deceleration as is martyred martyr for me has something manufactured him 

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.099
 The product is 

00:05:39.099 --> 00:05:40.370
 it's more trade 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.430
 what profession 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.250
 and therefore that emotion is not threatened
