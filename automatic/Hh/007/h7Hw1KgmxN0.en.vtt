00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
to a little bit of the audio and then

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.150 
to a little bit of the audio and then
I'm<00:00:29.340> going<00:00:29.519> to<00:00:29.580> play<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.470> how<00:00:31.470> I<00:00:31.500> think<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:32.009> goes

simple<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.789> check<00:00:45.390> this<00:00:45.510> out<00:00:45.660> here's<00:00:45.899> a<00:00:45.930> little

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
simple so check this out here's a little

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:59.170 
simple so check this out here's a little
bit<00:00:46.200> of<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.320> audio<00:00:46.620> go<00:00:47.190> something<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:47.579> this

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.180 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.349

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
now I'm going to play it how I think it

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.310 
now I'm going to play it how I think it
goes<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> check<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.629> out<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> play<00:01:04.170> a<00:01:04.199> little

slower<00:01:04.680> I<00:01:21.979> actually<00:01:22.979> left<00:01:23.340> out<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.580> couple<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
slower I actually left out a couple of

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.749 
slower I actually left out a couple of
the<00:01:24.090> hi-hat<00:01:24.479> chicks<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.740> let<00:01:26.040> me<00:01:26.130> add<00:01:26.280> those<00:01:26.549> in

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
the hi-hat chicks so let me add those in

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.070 
the hi-hat chicks so let me add those in
there<00:01:26.909> so<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.180> can<00:01:27.330> see<00:01:27.450> how<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
there so you can see how that that

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:47.179 
there so you can see how that that
sounds<00:01:42.680> now<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.030> take<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.420> beat<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:46.189> you

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
sounds now if you take that beat and you

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.120 
sounds now if you take that beat and you
break<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.490> down<00:01:47.790> in<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.450> linear<00:01:48.750> style<00:01:52.130> it's

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
break it down in a linear style it's

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.330 
break it down in a linear style it's
gonna<00:01:53.280> sound<00:01:53.549> something<00:01:53.939> like<00:01:53.970> this<00:01:55.340> well

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
gonna sound something like this well

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.870 
gonna sound something like this well
first<00:01:56.579> let<00:01:56.700> me<00:01:56.759> explain<00:01:57.060> linear<00:01:57.899> style<00:01:58.229> means

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
first let me explain linear style means

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.010 
first let me explain linear style means
on<00:01:59.880> every<00:02:00.259> sixteenth<00:02:01.259> note<00:02:01.530> or<00:02:02.009> eighth<00:02:02.430> note

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
on every sixteenth note or eighth note

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.069 
on every sixteenth note or eighth note
or<00:02:04.020> quarter<00:02:04.530> note<00:02:04.969> only<00:02:05.969> one<00:02:06.659> thing<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
or quarter note only one thing is

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.440 
or quarter note only one thing is
happening<00:02:07.320> on<00:02:07.970> every<00:02:08.970> beat<00:02:09.209> every<00:02:11.090> time<00:02:12.090> for

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
happening on every beat every time for

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.800 
happening on every beat every time for
example<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.170> you're<00:02:13.620> counting<00:02:13.830> one<00:02:14.790> E<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.150> two

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
example if you're counting one E and two

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.410 
example if you're counting one E and two
E<00:02:16.290> and<00:02:16.620> three<00:02:17.250> E<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.090> four<00:02:18.690> E<00:02:19.200> and<00:02:20.209> you<00:02:21.209> might

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
E and three E and four E and you might

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:33.090 
E and three E and four E and you might
play<00:02:21.690> something<00:02:22.110> like<00:02:22.290> this

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.210 

so<00:02:34.120> on<00:02:35.120> every<00:02:35.240> sixteenth<00:02:35.780> note<00:02:36.020> it's<00:02:36.860> either

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
so on every sixteenth note it's either

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.940 
so on every sixteenth note it's either
the<00:02:37.670> hi<00:02:37.820> hat<00:02:38.060> or<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.390> snare<00:02:38.690> or<00:02:38.930> the<00:02:39.440> bass<00:02:39.620> drum

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
the hi hat or the snare or the bass drum

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.970 
the hi hat or the snare or the bass drum
only<00:02:40.850> one<00:02:41.030> thing<00:02:41.270> at<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.480> time<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:42.650> if<00:02:42.740> you<00:02:42.800> take

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
only one thing at a time so if you take

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.300 
only one thing at a time so if you take
James<00:02:43.310> Brown's<00:02:43.580> funky<00:02:44.060> drummer<00:02:44.920> and<00:02:45.920> you<00:02:46.100> play

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
James Brown's funky drummer and you play

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.600 
James Brown's funky drummer and you play
it<00:02:46.400> in<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.610> linear<00:02:46.820> style<00:02:48.310> you're<00:02:49.310> going<00:02:49.340> to<00:02:49.490> get

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
it in a linear style you're going to get

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:08.080 
it in a linear style you're going to get
something<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:50.000> this<00:03:06.400> faster<00:03:07.400> it's<00:03:07.820> going<00:03:08.000> to

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
something like this faster it's going to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:24.310 
something like this faster it's going to
sound<00:03:08.270> like<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:22.360> so<00:03:23.360> let<00:03:23.630> me<00:03:23.720> count<00:03:23.959> that<00:03:24.140> for

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:24.320 
sound like this so let me count that for

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.740 
sound like this so let me count that for
you<00:03:24.470> one<00:03:24.620> last<00:03:24.830> time<00:03:24.980> so<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:25.459> can<00:03:25.750> maybe

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
you one last time so you can maybe

00:03:26.750 --> 00:04:13.610 
you one last time so you can maybe
figure<00:03:27.350> it<00:03:27.620> out

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:16.830 

good<00:04:14.620> luck
