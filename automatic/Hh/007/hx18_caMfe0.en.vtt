and<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.960> one<00:00:22.140> pattern<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.710> it<00:00:23.039> says<00:00:23.250> to

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
and the one pattern I have it says to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.410 
and the one pattern I have it says to
drop<00:00:23.820> six<00:00:24.240> rows<00:00:24.570> to<00:00:25.350> go<00:00:25.500> down<00:00:25.650> six<00:00:25.949> rows<00:00:26.420> so

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
drop six rows to go down six rows so

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.820 
drop six rows to go down six rows so
it'll<00:00:27.660> be<00:00:27.779> one<00:00:28.019> two<00:00:28.289> three<00:00:28.760> four<00:00:29.760> five<00:00:30.240> six<00:00:30.830> so

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
it'll be one two three four five six so

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.220

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
but if that I hope that explains it I

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:18.160 
but if that I hope that explains it I
know<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:17.120> took<00:03:17.450> me<00:03:17.510> a<00:03:17.660> while<00:03:17.750> to<00:03:17.810> kind<00:03:18.079> of

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
know it took me a while to kind of

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.440 
know it took me a while to kind of
figure<00:03:18.319> it<00:03:18.410> out<00:03:18.500> myself<00:03:18.680> but<00:03:19.220> I<00:03:19.459> like<00:03:20.090> the<00:03:20.239> Tuck
