00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:09.580
 good afternoon dear friends tomorrow 1 June 

00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:15.860
 I have a ticket to Moscow 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:18.380
 we return to our home-made distillery 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.470
 by the brewery for half a month I was not 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:29.560
 in Moscow, I want to grab 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:33.579
 here are the berries and fruits 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.970
 home garden 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:46.510
 but last year's warmths are right here with us 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:52.390
 saucers dried cherries are so soft 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:58.840
 last year's cherry here with us 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:01:02.180
 dried apples and dried pears 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.670
 fruits we have these berries grown in 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:11.139
 Buryatia 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:14.060
 they are grown Nizhny Novgorod region on 

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:17.569
 the shore of the Gorky reservoir in 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:21.770
 one of the settlements in the homeland 

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:24.069
 Chicago did relatives live too 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.289
 they sent 

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:28.420
 you can cook compote and add to compote 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.810
 and these dried fruits 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:39.829
 You can do something odd too, but I 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:42.049
 decided upon arrival in the city of Moscow to do 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.790
 the simplest thing that happens 

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:50.180
 do it alcohol and sugar 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:55.100
 then more from dilute it there degrees 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:56.440
 up to 40 to 45 and make alcohol 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.720
 hoods 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.720
 alcohol extracts from here 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.190
 fruits and berries 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:15.670
 That is the meaning of what is the easiest 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.740
 option for which he acts 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:22.640
 novice self-racers then getting 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.209
 moonshine and boats and sugar on the second 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.350
 by stage 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:30.100
 people start doing all sorts of 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:35.890
 cordials and liqueurs and cordials 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.890
 what are liqueurs and tinctures and liqueurs and 

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.660
 tinctures are slides without adding 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.020
 Sahara 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:49.090
 there are sweet and then we went 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.090
 ruler than more sugar topic 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.900
 the difference is unlike that there are just 30 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:05.540
 40 and 50 grams per 100 milliliters for us 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.040
 such a scale at home for distillers 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:17.989
 more affect 1 ie sugar free y 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:22.420
 Us this bitter tincture 2030 on 100 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:26.150
 milliliters it's sweet so much further 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:29.700
 100 grams it is a sweet liqueur 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:33.650
 understandably well, and there 35 tons 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:38.840
 40 50 g is already liquor 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:46.340
 sugar content per 100 milliliters 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:46.340
 in this case, here we have that and here 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:54.720
 raw materials will make alcohol extract and 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.120
 add sugar to taste depending on 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:03.870
 of how much sugar will we have 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.769
 work out or sweet so I think 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.810
 what is it going to be 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:13.140
 from pears and here or we will have sweet 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.470
 liqueur most likely but this external 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:18.810
 or so I suspect from apple 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.269
 let's see what I do what kind 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.510
 trading here can be sweet too 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:29.310
 tincture or liqueur look here I 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.570
 always want to say dear friends not 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.389

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.180
 there special recipes are actually all 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.639
 elementary just to do here 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:46.470
 such a good homemade drink sincere 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:50.669
 need water sugar yeast and that's what 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.460
 any terminator 1 and raw and everything all 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.139
 the rest is like a cook in the kitchen that's how 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.340
 good cook in a restaurant 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:58.340

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.430
 I listen to listen here 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:07.100
 some inner such taste 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:09.380
 in short no need to stick 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.190
 strict some recipes before this 

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:13.430
 sweeter 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:16.009
 make sweeter love the rank not 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:19.280
 add sugar like that 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.789
 then you will constantly have a taste 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.889
 It will turn out tasty here for one and a half 

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.570
 months here 

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:28.820

 home-brewed beer is homebrew home 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:54.020

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:04.220
 shopping if properly soak 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.770
 barrel and make the right look to separate 

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:09.349
