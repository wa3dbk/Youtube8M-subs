00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:08.740
 new video tutorial with wolf good in 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.710
 the support web page that I created 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.360
 I have seen that a user has entered 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.080
 a support message in which he tells me 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.189
 that has a problem in installed yes and 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.580
 Let's see if I can help you 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:23.349
 install it good here we have the homs and 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.410
 on Monday and let me in a video I 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:28.210
 it seems that is this then here we have 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.640
 three files that is a series about 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.080
 three installation instructions 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.290
 let's do with the iso is going to be riding 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.030
 the iso 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:39.840
 for this I use the power and so 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.840
 we ride 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:46.170
 like zac and it's already mounted let's open 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.710
 a new window and we're going to start the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.710
 installer 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:05.790
 and we check that it starts 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.790
 choose English as a language 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.450
 this is a pretty simple installer 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.700
 it's all next - here we accept 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.590
 next terms 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.560
 accept and here he asks us two things 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.510
 customer and it would be this comes in the 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.070
 binder 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:29.870
 in which we downloaded the WHO and the 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.180
 which in my case is this 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.670
 that I had you remember instructions and 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.150
 l &amp; m we opened the instructions and I was not 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.700
 says customer is this 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.220
 we copy 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.380
 we arrived 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.380
 the serial is this we copy 

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:51.009
 and we paste 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:55.390
 even next tells us that this 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.150
 registration has been satisfactory 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.240
 We said the installation path by 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.390
 defect I leave that next and we wait for 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.900
 I ended up installing 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.560
 we are seeing that it is already finishing 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:12.350
 install 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.030
 let's leave it like that 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.270
 next there will be no need to 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.290
 before starting anything install a 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.879
 upgrade 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.879
 finally copy the cart 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.750
 has already been installed 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:36.050
 let's finish now where 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:39.580
 we had open in the who and 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.580
 in my case it is this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 let's go date 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.090
 and we are going to install the update 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.219
 steps to install the data are the 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:58.960
 same as to install the program in 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:03:01.650
 yes we simply choose the language 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.650
 okay 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.959
 Here below we accept the conditions 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:12.120
 next asks us again the same 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.220
 data that I have already copied before 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.670
 serial here 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.300
 and we take the customer from the file 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.870
 OK 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.320
 we copy here we go to next tells us 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.700
 that the registration has been satisfactory 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:35.500
 next and we 'll wait again what 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:35.500
 to install the update 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.280
 seemingly journey to liz shares of 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:44.730
 map vehicles 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.730
 scenarios and so on 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:02.819
 at the end of installing we are going to finish 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.370
 and now what we have next 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:06.750
 what to do is in the game notice that 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.150
 is this 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:12.560
 we enter the skip draw folder and 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:15.680
 we copy this one 

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.139
 and the 11th point xxi 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.789
 we copy 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:21.789
 we go to program files 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.760
 on the other depends 

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.540
 ppt 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.010
 you have to find it 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.280
 I do not know if it is here or is in the other 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.400
 let's see here 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:52.639
 it's fine already seen here is 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:55.639
 is this a yes and here what we're going 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:55.639
 directly 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.610
 will ask us to leave one of these 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:01.610
 options we are going to replace the file 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.310
 in the destiny 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.560
 and with this we would have the who and ready 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.090
 to start we would simply have to 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.970
 give him here 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:13.070
 to the homsi here and it would be ready 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.090
 I hope it was help to the user and 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.129
 that has put the incidence in the 

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:18.969
 support 

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:18.969
 good greetings
