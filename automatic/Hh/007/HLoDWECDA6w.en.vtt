00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:45.079 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:48.220 

and<00:00:45.550> I've<00:00:46.550> always<00:00:46.730> been<00:00:47.089> interested<00:00:47.780> in<00:00:48.109> how

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 
and I've always been interested in how

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.979 
and I've always been interested in how
music<00:00:48.589> videos<00:00:48.890> are<00:00:48.980> made<00:00:49.159> so<00:00:49.909> and<00:00:50.390> there's<00:00:50.929> a

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
music videos are made so and there's a

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.419 
music videos are made so and there's a
technique<00:00:51.199> called<00:00:51.379> under<00:00:51.829> cranking<00:00:52.280> that

00:00:52.419 --> 00:00:52.429 
technique called under cranking that

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:54.910 
technique called under cranking that
they<00:00:52.579> use<00:00:52.760> in<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:52.999> lot<00:00:53.120> of<00:00:53.210> hip-hop<00:00:53.359> videos<00:00:53.920> for

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
they use in a lot of hip-hop videos for

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.639 
they use in a lot of hip-hop videos for
years<00:00:55.100> and<00:00:55.190> years<00:00:55.250> I<00:00:55.519> am<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.870> basically<00:00:57.260> you

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
years and years I am it's basically you

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.439 
years and years I am it's basically you
dance<00:00:57.890> to<00:00:58.070> something<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.460> a<00:00:58.489> slower<00:00:58.789> speed<00:00:58.909> and

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
dance to something at a slower speed and

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.000 
dance to something at a slower speed and
then<00:00:59.570> you<00:00:59.659> speed<00:00:59.929> it<00:01:00.019> up<00:01:00.109> so<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.559> looks<00:01:00.799> kind<00:01:00.979> of

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
then you speed it up so it looks kind of

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.829 
then you speed it up so it looks kind of
robotic<00:01:01.369> and<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:02.269> I<00:01:02.329> thought<00:01:02.539> it<00:01:02.629> would<00:01:02.719> be

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:02.839 
robotic and so I thought it would be

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:11.950 
robotic and so I thought it would be
cool<00:01:03.019> to<00:01:03.079> do<00:01:03.379> that<00:01:03.559> for<00:01:03.859> him<00:01:04.009> dancing<00:01:10.479> so<00:01:11.479> me

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
cool to do that for him dancing so me

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.050 
cool to do that for him dancing so me
and<00:01:12.080> my<00:01:12.140> friend<00:01:12.170> Billy<00:01:12.530> air<00:01:12.860> just<00:01:13.369> set<00:01:13.580> up<00:01:13.700> the

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:14.060 
and my friend Billy air just set up the

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.940 
and my friend Billy air just set up the
shoot<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:14.689> his<00:01:14.869> back<00:01:15.049> garden<00:01:15.080> one<00:01:15.530> day<00:01:15.710> and

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
shoot and his back garden one day and

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.969 
shoot and his back garden one day and
and<00:01:16.880> it<00:01:17.240> took<00:01:17.450> about<00:01:17.569> seven<00:01:18.110> minutes<00:01:18.470> issue

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
and it took about seven minutes issue

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.340 
and it took about seven minutes issue
because<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:20.420> because<00:01:20.509> that's<00:01:20.720> how<00:01:20.929> long<00:01:20.960> the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
because just because that's how long the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.840 
because just because that's how long the
