00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
that was a coincidence well I would say

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.140 
that was a coincidence well I would say
that<00:02:42.570> that's<00:02:42.750> a<00:02:42.870> meaningless<00:02:43.230> statement

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
kawin deserts in that's simply to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.810 
kawin deserts in that's simply to
observe<00:02:46.800> something<00:02:47.430> that's<00:02:47.580> patently

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
observe something that's patently

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.240

obvious<00:02:48.060> which<00:02:48.630> is<00:02:48.750> a<00:02:48.780> co<00:02:49.050> inside<00:02:49.650> that's<00:02:49.920> two

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
obvious which is a co inside that's two

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.370 
obvious which is a co inside that's two

things that happened together at the
same<00:02:52.530> time<00:02:52.970> it's<00:02:53.970> just<00:02:54.060> a<00:02:54.240> completely
