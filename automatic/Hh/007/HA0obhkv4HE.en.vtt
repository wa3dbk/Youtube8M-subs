00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:10.389
 hello to you my dear viewer you 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.789
 You look brik reviews designer and 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:15.460
 Today my designer is not firm brik 

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:17.050
 I decided to please you and myself to others 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.320
 Chinese or 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:24.059
 This is a Russian analogue of Lego and there is 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:28.239
 aspects of the firm play smart 

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:31.540
 super hero series the chinese can't 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.710
 Come without a word super so set two 

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.770
 in one collect 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.910
 collect a robot or fighter filled up 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.580
 his collection of heroes 

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.910
 use other models from this series 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.310
 so a set of 143 Circuits age 6 plus and 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:47.460
 here is shown another model which 

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:51.400
 you can collect on them but this 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.739
 transformer on the back we 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:57.280
 we can see other sets of the same series 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:01:00.250
 this is our military and military police car 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.130
 the fire department is ours now 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.280
 here we have robots and moving 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.799
 Minifigure elements presented in 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.389
 This set of fighter himself 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.200
 I usually do not like the transformer 

00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:16.479
 designers of other firms are not brik but in 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.460
 this time I thought why not take 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:21.909
 This designer has a good price and 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.389
 he looks so spectacular 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.639
 I know and I wanted to take it and buy it 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:29.770
 so now he's on my desk and me 

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:38.020
 can not wait to open it and collect 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:39.610
 let's open in the instruction set not 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:42.700
 may be 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.430
 but no 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:48.750
 can viewers meet this stickers 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.750
 stickers this viewer 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.580
 Wow 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.460
 this I have not seen guys you understand 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.430
 as they opened it opened with 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.920
 Here are these, here is a bunch of real in Chinese 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.200
 A set is rarely seen here so that the package 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:10.000
 opening is so simple and good 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:11.800
 Wuhuuuu four piles of cams and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.630
 put it all in detail and now we 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.310
 proceed to build 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.300
 I want to draw your attention to 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:23.080
 the instruction to me as a brik lover is very 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:25.510
 it's unusual to see such an instruction in 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.239
 principle plastic could have been better yes 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.280
 fastened somehow tight but as I already 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.470
 spoke in one of his videos better 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:38.530
 to fasten tugovato than filed 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:41.320
 agree to the full floor 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:44.290
 in general, to be honest, I'm with transformers 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:46.000
 first time i'm dealing with this i never 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.950
 did not buy designers 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.440
 Transformers for some reason I thought it was 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.660
 some kind of childish fun or something though i 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.100
 and now I think so, in principle, we are 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.280
 like this coloring of this 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:59.860
 transformer same orange-black colors 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:02.370
 look very stylish look what 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.489
 awesome rubberized robot head and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:08.769
 I thought that it could be attached to 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:13.120
 let's try a character like that 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:16.209
 unhook your head insert my name is 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.180
 Optimus Prime I came to protect the earth from 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:21.580
 decepticons 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.890
 oh guys I almost assembled me 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.590
 really like really fastens everything 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:31.709
 well firmly so know straight tight 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:34.900
 once hold everything together and then figs from 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.420
 unhooked in general assembly really such 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.220
 it turns out interesting 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:41.709
 which is very important for the designer to 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:44.799
 the assembly was an interesting one 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.780
 we got a robot in the set is not 

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:50.080
 This is used here but I think 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:52.570
 she for our fighter 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.330
 most likely the way it is the wire 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:57.370
 turned out more than awesome I somehow 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.320
 glued on the stickers of course there was not 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.590
 it is written where to glue but I guessed 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.960
 regards itself but the set I thought it would be 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.350
 worse much worse because for such 

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:09.490
 the price of a good robot to get it 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.500
 really 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.230
 worth it let's consider it 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.920
 take a closer look at him 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:18.040
 blasters 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.170
 of which he shoots and here are mobiles 

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:22.690
 parts here he has these too 

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:26.740
 here are blasters but they are more powerful themselves 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.940
 you know yes the length is steeper too the same 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.390
 moving parts 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:33.610
 stupid robot face cabin where 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:35.890
 to fight that man you 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:38.190
 I'll show you a little later here too 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.780
 legs are such mobile elements 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.120
 principle very good robot turned out 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:43.710
 I like him very much 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.960
 minus 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:49.780
 this is probably the only one here 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.330
 part she sort of goes just like that 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:54.430
 that's how I am now like this 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.800
 she goes but she periodically 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:58.720
 this part falls off know y 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:01.870
 robots usually medicinal go empty 

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:04.240
 here is the place that is the mouth just in front 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:06.150
 so effectively the back is empty i'm glad that 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.730
 the creators of this constructor 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.280
 I did this function here, I think 

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:14.320
 looks nice but a little ridiculous 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.510
 this is probably something like the rangers 

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.780
 because see little man climbs in 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:22.180
 robot and fights dude looks here 

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:24.610
 like something like real to the rangers 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.890
 but for those who watched the movie rangers 

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.620
 should understand what I'm talking to him 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:30.820
 such a print on the face if honestly briki not 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.830
 saw such a print 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.990
 maybe he is, but I don't know for sure 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:38.169
 I can not speak and personally I have not seen a 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.270
 here to the left very much even saw and probably they 

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:42.820
 did something like left cool 

00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:45.750
 I like it, let's get in already 

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:48.430
 guy in our robot transformation 

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:50.680
 All dared man now can be safely 

00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:53.760
 kill go fraternal monsters know 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:57.580
 who mutated such and here is our 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:06:00.610
 let's call him a ranger with his hefty 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:06.189
 come to kill in 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:06.759
 1 kla evil and really very robot 

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:09.400
 steep 

00:06:06.759 --> 00:06:12.879
 but here came our review end in this 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.409
 video i won't show you the second model you 

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.039
 do not be offended at me do not be offended 

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.349
 scream 

00:06:15.039 --> 00:06:18.310
 the model is sure to be and it will be in 

00:06:17.349 --> 00:06:21.250
 next video 

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:23.289
 don't just say i'm mean 

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.680
 all this could not show in one video 

00:06:23.289 --> 00:06:25.840
 everything 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:28.509

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.150
 interesting 

00:06:32.189 --> 00:06:39.310
 this is a robot firm brik and it is small and i 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.250
 I don't want to make a separate issue for him 

00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.039
 so I will make a release for the second 

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:48.639
 model of our robot supergirl and how 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:51.340
 written on the box and as in addition 

00:06:48.639 --> 00:06:53.889
 will go here is such a robot firm 

00:06:51.340 --> 00:06:56.289
 Brick I think you my dear viewers all 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.779
 arrange think with this we figured out 

00:06:56.289 --> 00:07:02.500
 so let's sum up this 

00:06:58.779 --> 00:07:05.919
 sets the limit of 160 rubles and I put him 

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:06.930
 9 points yes yes yes I did not expect that 

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:09.879
 some 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:11.770
 to the designer who I see for the first time I 

00:07:09.879 --> 00:07:14.949
 put 9 points 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.080
 I really liked this robot later 

00:07:14.949 --> 00:07:20.379
 I 'll look at the second model can 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.069
 also put another ball and generally give it 

00:07:20.379 --> 00:07:25.690
 robot is all over 10 points like this 

00:07:24.069 --> 00:07:27.759
