what we've got is a little rib cage
through<00:02:40.480> there<00:02:40.720> and<00:02:41.410> so<00:02:42.370> that<00:02:43.180> there<00:02:43.420> has<00:02:43.630> got

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
through there and so that there has got

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
the edge of the rib cage just cut along

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.110 
the edge of the rib cage just cut along
there<00:03:03.900> that<00:03:04.900> and<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:05.380> that's<00:03:05.560> all<00:03:06.070> rib<00:03:06.880> cage

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
there that and then that's all rib cage

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:16.199 
there that and then that's all rib cage
cuts<00:03:13.290> my<00:03:14.290> fat<00:03:14.920> and<00:03:15.220> now<00:03:15.400> all<00:03:15.640> about<00:03:15.910> that<00:03:16.060> is

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
cuts my fat and now all about that is

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.270 
cuts my fat and now all about that is
just<00:03:16.420> as<00:03:16.600> Philip<00:03:17.500> that's<00:03:17.620> a<00:03:17.769> perfect<00:03:18.190> little

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the water that's a rib cage that should

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.880 
the water that's a rib cage that should
live<00:03:49.239> a<00:03:49.269> little<00:03:49.540> bit<00:03:49.750> of<00:03:49.840> meat<00:03:50.019> there<00:03:50.230> enough

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:50.890

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
the skin let's make it already scaled a

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.800 
the skin let's make it already scaled a
lot<00:04:00.489> there<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:03.760> to<00:04:04.000> the<00:04:04.060> SEC<00:04:04.329> same<00:04:04.540> thing

straight down the back this may be a

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.520 
straight down the back this may be a
little<00:04:07.600> bit<00:04:07.870> harder<00:04:08.170> because<00:04:08.230> you<00:04:08.380> got

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
little bit harder because you got

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.680 
little bit harder because you got
nothing<00:04:08.799> to<00:04:08.890> balance<00:04:09.190> it<00:04:09.280> on<00:04:09.340> the<00:04:09.430> outside<00:04:09.690> but

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
nothing to balance it on the outside but

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.810 
nothing to balance it on the outside but
once<00:04:10.870> again<00:04:11.079> straight<00:04:11.590> down<00:04:11.829> the<00:04:11.980> backbone<00:04:12.700> as

once again straight down the backbone as

once again straight down the backbone as
a<00:04:12.850> guide

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:19.410 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.410 

you<00:04:20.410> probably<00:04:20.800> want<00:04:21.040> to<00:04:21.070> leave<00:04:21.280> about<00:04:21.580> maybe<00:04:22.330> a

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:22.420 
you probably want to leave about maybe a

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:25.610 
you probably want to leave about maybe a
thumb<00:04:22.720> link<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.680> in<00:04:23.920> case<00:04:24.160> you<00:04:24.340> can<00:04:24.550> use<00:04:24.820> much

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:25.620 
thumb link just in case you can use much

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.290 
thumb link just in case you can use much
flip<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.770> over<00:04:26.830> once<00:04:27.460> again<00:04:27.640> the<00:04:27.880> black<00:04:28.090> with

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
flip that over once again the black with

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:33.630 
flip that over once again the black with
the<00:04:28.330> ribcage<00:04:30.510> flip<00:04:31.510> over<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:33.190> only<00:04:33.370> want<00:04:33.520> to

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
the ribcage flip over you only want to

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.100 
the ribcage flip over you only want to
cut<00:04:33.820> down<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.030> couple<00:04:34.300> of<00:04:34.450> millimeters<00:04:34.900> just

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
cut down a couple of millimeters just

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.970 
cut down a couple of millimeters just
till<00:04:35.290> you<00:04:35.350> get<00:04:35.440> to<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> skin<00:04:35.980> and<00:04:37.770> rip<00:04:38.770> yet

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
till you get to the skin and rip yet

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:45.330 
till you get to the skin and rip yet
again<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:42.690> now<00:04:43.690> there<00:04:43.930> it's<00:04:44.770> got<00:04:44.980> no<00:04:45.130> meat

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340
