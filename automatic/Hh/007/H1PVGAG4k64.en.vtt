00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:06.270
 very good youtube people we are already 

00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:09.389
 here another video plus one more guide is 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:12.970
 we will go with the saints druid once 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:16.150
 pear as guardian 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:21.279
 an attack and let's see the changes that 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:23.920
 they've done all of life let's start 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:26.050
 the first new talent of the federal is 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.730
 called lunar inspiration which we 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.390
 grants the possibility of being able to launch 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.130
 lunar fire in feline form infringing 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.560
 the damage according to the attack power that 

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.780
 let's have the slopes of 30 points of 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.210
 energy and generates a point of how the 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.340
 objective therefore we would spend from month 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.400
 two skills that generate points of 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.830
 combos and they would be scratched and crushed 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.670
 have three with lunar fire 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.670
 if we merge 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.059
 in second place we have the event that 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.250
 it's called bloody wars that 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:58.629
 us of some passive skill in 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.520
 the one that after throwing touches of 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.579
 education these following faculties 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:06.430
 gulf bodies infinity 30 percent 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.150
 Extra free is consumed by doing both 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.619
 attacks or after past 30 seconds 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.720
 an ability that depends a lot on 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.820
 time or the probability since 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.550
 we will only use it when you touch 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.590
 in action clear central cent be 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.080
 instantaneous we would not lose the seconds 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.600
 physicists in punishing a skill that 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.470
 as much as it gives us that we had those 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.290
 seconds to do continuous tps 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.370
 our third talent is claws say 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.200
 go let's go the new blow which we 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.810
 change the destroyed form to a model 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.240
 similar to the were here but in kitty 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.660
 that gives us the same faculty of 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.000
 normal singing more we increase the 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.310
 versatility 5 percent and we 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.120
 allows to cast spells that are not 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.510
 harmful 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.850
 with more than gels without changing shape 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.920
 and so do not waste time just in case 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.229
 you know what versatility is a new 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.750
 improvement that the characters will have 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.570
 which increases both the damage and the 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.580
 healing done and reduces the damage 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:11.280
 received the talents of the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:14.400
 criminal now we are dealing with the tanks 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.440
 talents destroyed bordering the first 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.240
 lieutenant is called Monday's guardian the 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.370
 which does not modify the defense ability 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.430
 wild doing that instead of increasing 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.360
 our ability to dodge 45 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.430
 hundred 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.700
 we increase it one hundred percent but 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:33.069
 lowering its durability from 6 seconds to 3 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.650
 good to see also lowers us his 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:37.750
 reuse some percent of 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.000
 our probability of dodging 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.610
 the second talent is called pulverizar 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.650
 which is an instantaneous ability that 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.440
 hits the target causing a 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:49.360
 great damage and now you will see that 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:52.840
 consumes three accumulations of lar 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:55.030
 and it reduces the damage received by 20% 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.520
 for 20 seconds at the moment I do not know 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.350
 well how are the agro tanks going in a 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.450
 only objective but let's go with this 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.520
 life talent wait I do not think that 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.250
 have that good problem and finally 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.680
 we have fur bristling a skill 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.420
 snapshot with one minute resolution 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.600
 in which we reduce all the damage 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.110
 received either magical or physical is a 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.360
 50% for three seconds finally a 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.890
 thing else I've been looking for so much with 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.720
 the book of spells as in the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.120
 tank skills but we have in 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.920
 anywhere and it's an exclusive luxury to 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:29.770
 the spheres tank that is called eternal 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.370
 primitive city which the person once 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:36.040
 that we take damage from a physical attack 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:38.110
 we will obtain an absorption shield of the 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:40.760
 Physical damage equivalent to 23 per 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.909
 hundred of the damage received 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:47.090
 come on a free mini shield or be 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:49.760
 guardian of the people and that's all I keep 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.069
 working on the video of the 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.920
 transmissions came in a bit I guess that 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:57.590
 I will put it and in other classes I will go 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:01.900
 Seeing what requests you are making 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:01.900
 and very little greetings and thanks
