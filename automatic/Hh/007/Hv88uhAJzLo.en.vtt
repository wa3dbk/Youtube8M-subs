00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
all the instruments in front of us will

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:25.789 
all the instruments in front of us will
work<00:02:23.370> hopefully<00:02:24.500> obviously<00:02:25.500> temperature

00:02:25.789 --> 00:02:25.799 
work hopefully obviously temperature

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.229 
work hopefully obviously temperature
gauge<00:02:25.950> is<00:02:26.040> showing<00:02:26.370> next<00:02:26.519> nothing<00:02:26.909> the<00:02:27.030> minute

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
gauge is showing next nothing the minute

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.149 
gauge is showing next nothing the minute
because<00:02:27.420> we<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.629> just<00:02:27.870> started<00:02:28.200> from<00:02:28.379> stone

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
because we very just started from stone

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:34.190 
because we very just started from stone
cold<00:02:29.519> but<00:02:30.920> the<00:02:32.689> temperature<00:02:33.689> gauge<00:02:33.780> does<00:02:34.049> work

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
cold but the temperature gauge does work

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.360 
cold but the temperature gauge does work
properly<00:02:34.409> as<00:02:34.650> do<00:02:34.799> all<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:34.950> other<00:02:35.069> instruments
