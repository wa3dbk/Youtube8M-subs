00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
hey guys over the epic air with a

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.540 
hey guys over the epic air with a
tutorial<00:00:03.830> today<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:05.130> have<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.690> mechanism<00:00:06.690> not

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
tutorial today we have the mechanism not

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.690 
tutorial today we have the mechanism not
with<00:00:08.550> um<00:00:09.710> we're<00:00:10.710> making<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.160> hydrogen

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
with um we're making a hydrogen

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.330 
with um we're making a hydrogen
generator<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:13.049> this<00:00:13.139> mod<00:00:13.349> is<00:00:13.469> really<00:00:13.710> cool<00:00:13.920> so

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
generator and this mod is really cool so

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.140 
generator and this mod is really cool so
I<00:00:14.370> thought<00:00:14.639> I'd<00:00:14.759> do<00:00:14.910> to<00:00:15.120> talk<00:00:15.299> about<00:00:17.119> okay<00:00:18.119> so

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
I thought I'd do to talk about okay so

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.140 
I thought I'd do to talk about okay so
you're<00:00:18.810> gonna<00:00:18.960> want<00:00:19.199> to<00:00:19.289> do<00:00:19.609> you<00:00:20.609> might<00:00:20.789> you're

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
you're gonna want to do you might you're

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.759 
you're gonna want to do you might you're
gonna<00:00:21.500> come<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:23.600> let's<00:00:24.600> find<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.960> place<00:00:25.109> random

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
gonna come on let's find a place random

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:39.530 
gonna come on let's find a place random
place<00:00:29.599> can<00:00:30.599> make<00:00:30.630> like<00:00:31.050> a<00:00:31.080> pool<00:00:35.870> do<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:38.420> on<00:00:39.420> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
place can make like a pool do this on a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.750 
place can make like a pool do this on a
pump<00:00:40.340> electric<00:00:41.340> pump<00:00:42.980> some<00:00:43.980> water<00:00:44.070> underneath

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
pump electric pump some water underneath

pump electric pump some water underneath
it<00:00:48.680> and<00:00:50.539> what<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.690> wanna<00:00:51.899> hold<00:00:52.410> on<00:00:52.590> I<00:00:52.860> should

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
it and what you wanna hold on I should

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.130 
it and what you wanna hold on I should
do<00:00:53.670> first<00:00:56.510> but<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:58.460> you<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.850> get<00:01:00.030> a

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
do first but your you have to get a

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.759 
do first but your you have to get a
electronic<00:01:01.160> electronic<00:01:02.160> tick<00:01:02.789> that<00:01:03.769> let's

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
electronic electronic tick that let's

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.450 
electronic electronic tick that let's
try<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.100> tick<00:01:05.900> separator<00:01:06.900> twist<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> around<00:01:08.100> at

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
try a tick separator twist it around at

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.109 
try a tick separator twist it around at
the<00:01:08.549> wrench<00:01:08.760> by<00:01:09.000> right<00:01:09.810> clicking<00:01:10.850> turn<00:01:11.850> around

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
the wrench by right clicking turn around

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.710 
the wrench by right clicking turn around
so<00:01:12.240> it's<00:01:12.390> facing<00:01:13.640> then<00:01:14.640> right<00:01:15.060> behind<00:01:15.270> it

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so it's facing then right behind it

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.350 
so it's facing then right behind it
you're<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.110> put<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:16.710> hydrogen<00:01:17.130> this<00:01:18.090> will

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you're gonna put a hydrogen this will

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.130 
you're gonna put a hydrogen this will
generate<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:20.540> okay<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:22.189> I'm<00:01:23.189> gonna<00:01:23.310> do<00:01:24.140> get

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
generate the I okay so I'm gonna do get

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.330 
generate the I okay so I'm gonna do get
some<00:01:25.409> Universal<00:01:25.979> cables<00:01:26.400> oh<00:01:26.729> yeah<00:01:27.049> that's<00:01:28.049> a

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
you want into a solid and that will

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.859 
you want into a solid and that will
power<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> pump<00:01:48.540> so<00:01:49.520> yeah<00:01:52.700> okay<00:01:53.700> next<00:01:53.970> you're

gonna<00:01:55.049> wanna<00:01:55.380> get<00:01:55.740> some<00:01:56.070> chemical<00:01:56.640> pipes

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
gonna wanna get some chemical pipes

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.859 
gonna wanna get some chemical pipes
connected

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.359 

think<00:02:05.869> I'm<00:02:05.960> gonna<00:02:06.110> stay<00:02:06.740> here<00:02:07.220> oh<00:02:07.720> yeah<00:02:08.720> I<00:02:09.440> am

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
think I'm gonna stay here oh yeah I am

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.330 
think I'm gonna stay here oh yeah I am
set<00:02:11.290> day<00:02:13.120> cuz<00:02:14.120> the<00:02:14.450> solar<00:02:14.720> power<00:02:15.160> will<00:02:16.160> only

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
set day cuz the solar power will only

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.620 
set day cuz the solar power will only
generate<00:02:16.640> during<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.180> day

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
generate during the day

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.140 
generate during the day
oh<00:02:17.660> oh<00:02:19.690> come<00:02:20.690> here

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:22.150 
oh oh come here

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:30.010 
oh oh come here
spill<00:02:23.150> the<00:02:24.760> what's<00:02:25.760> happening<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:27.310> think<00:02:29.020> here

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
spill the what's happening I think here

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.890 
spill the what's happening I think here
we<00:02:30.110> go<00:02:30.230> there<00:02:30.470> we<00:02:30.560> go<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.209> you're<00:02:32.690> only

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
we go there we go so it's you're only

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.420 
we go there we go so it's you're only
gonna<00:02:33.140> generate<00:02:33.590> during<00:02:33.860> the<00:02:33.950> day<00:02:34.099> if<00:02:34.220> you<00:02:34.340> use

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
gonna generate during the day if you use

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.449 
gonna generate during the day if you use
a<00:02:34.459> solar<00:02:34.819> power<00:02:35.120> generator<00:02:35.900> because<00:02:36.769> doesn't

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:37.459 
a solar power generator because doesn't

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.220 
a solar power generator because doesn't
there's<00:02:37.880> no<00:02:37.940> solar<00:02:38.269> energy<00:02:38.720> during<00:02:38.900> the<00:02:38.989> night

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
there's no solar energy during the night

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.610 
there's no solar energy during the night
so<00:02:40.130> then<00:02:40.340> when<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:40.610> do<00:02:40.790> that<00:02:41.530> it's<00:02:42.530> a

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
so then when you do that it's a

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.770 
so then when you do that it's a
mechanical<00:02:42.769> plate<00:02:44.560> onto<00:02:45.560> here<00:02:45.980> and<00:02:46.660> then<00:02:47.660> it

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
mechanical plate onto here and then it

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.729 
mechanical plate onto here and then it
will<00:02:47.989> supply<00:02:48.590> that<00:02:50.140> whole<00:02:51.140> thing<00:02:51.440> I<00:02:51.530> want<00:02:51.680> to

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
will supply that whole thing I want to

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:00.870 
will supply that whole thing I want to
try<00:02:52.069> here<00:02:56.019> try<00:02:57.019> to<00:02:57.080> do<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:59.230> there<00:03:00.230> we<00:03:00.350> go

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
try here try to do this there we go

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:07.570 
try here try to do this there we go
alright<00:03:01.880> so<00:03:02.060> when<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.780> have<00:03:03.080> that<00:03:03.440> oh<00:03:06.580> yeah

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
alright so when you have that oh yeah

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.069 
alright so when you have that oh yeah
for<00:03:08.569> the<00:03:08.660> dumb<00:03:08.870> part<00:03:09.290> change<00:03:10.010> it<00:03:10.160> to<00:03:10.280> oxygen

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
for the dumb part change it to oxygen

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:14.110 
for the dumb part change it to oxygen
then<00:03:12.079> change<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.769> which<00:03:13.370> is<00:03:13.549> the<00:03:13.640> oh<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:14.030> they

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120 
then change the which is the oh and they

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.680 
then change the which is the oh and they
change<00:03:14.390> the<00:03:14.540> output<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:15.590> H<00:03:15.880> and<00:03:16.880> then<00:03:17.420> it<00:03:17.570> will

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
change the output to H and then it will

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.240 
change the output to H and then it will
start<00:03:18.019> creating<00:03:18.820> anything<00:03:19.820> harder<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:22.130> it

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
start creating anything harder and it

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.810 
start creating anything harder and it
can<00:03:22.370> power<00:03:22.549> many<00:03:22.910> things<00:03:23.230> by<00:03:24.230> the<00:03:24.290> way<00:03:24.820> it's

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
can power many things by the way it's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.370 
can power many things by the way it's
very<00:03:25.880> nice<00:03:26.239> generator<00:03:26.750> it's<00:03:26.930> one<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.140> the<00:03:27.200> best

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
very nice generator it's one of the best
