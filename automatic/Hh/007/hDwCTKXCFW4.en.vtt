00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
verbose but delicate verbose but that I

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.430 
verbose but delicate verbose but that I
am<00:01:11.520> no<00:01:12.300> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.690> it's<00:01:12.780> an<00:01:12.900> unanswerable

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
am no I think it's an unanswerable

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.200 
am no I think it's an unanswerable
question<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.100> don't<00:01:14.160> think<00:01:14.340> anyone<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> view<00:01:15.180> of

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
question I don't think anyone in view of

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.460 
question I don't think anyone in view of
the<00:01:15.360> things<00:01:15.540> that<00:01:15.660> go<00:01:15.810> on<00:01:15.900> in<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.080> last<00:01:16.290> few

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
the things that go on in the last few

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.810 
the things that go on in the last few
years<00:01:16.530> knows<00:01:16.890> what's<00:01:17.160> gonna<00:01:17.280> happen<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.700> that

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
years knows what's gonna happen in that

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.170 
years knows what's gonna happen in that
in<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.630> next<00:01:18.870> two<00:01:19.020> years<00:01:19.700> down<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.880> road<00:01:20.909> I

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
in the next two years down the road I

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
in the next two years down the road I
think<00:01:21.510> that<00:01:21.659> everyone<00:01:22.020> should<00:01:22.050> hope<00:01:22.440> and<00:01:22.650> pray

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
think that everyone should hope and pray

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.920 
think that everyone should hope and pray
that<00:01:22.890> people<00:01:23.730> to<00:01:23.820> they'll<00:01:23.970> do<00:01:24.270> the<00:01:24.420> job<00:01:24.450> so

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
that people to they'll do the job so

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.810 
that people to they'll do the job so
well<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.320> won't<00:01:25.380> be<00:01:25.500> any<00:01:25.730> question<00:01:26.730> about

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
well there won't be any question about

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.760 
well there won't be any question about
it<00:01:26.970> because<00:01:27.870> if<00:01:27.990> they<00:01:28.110> do<00:01:28.170> then<00:01:28.440> everything's

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
it because if they do then everything's

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
it because if they do then everything's
alright<00:01:29.100> with<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.280> rest<00:01:29.460> of<00:01:29.580> us<00:01:29.900> you<00:01:30.900> think

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
alright with the rest of us you think

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.470 
alright with the rest of us you think
they're<00:01:31.680> doing<00:01:31.920> their<00:01:32.040> job<00:01:32.070> well<00:01:32.460> well<00:01:33.450> I

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480

they're doing their job well well I
agree<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.960> some<00:01:34.140> things<00:01:34.170> and<00:01:34.560> disagree<00:01:34.950> with

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
agree with some things and disagree with

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.460 
agree with some things and disagree with
others<00:01:35.370> when<00:01:36.300> they<00:01:36.450> when<00:01:36.960> they<00:01:37.080> give<00:01:37.290> me<00:01:37.440> a

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
others when they when they give me a

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.020 
others when they when they give me a
when<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.040> give<00:01:38.190> me<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> choice<00:01:38.580> between<00:01:38.850> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
when they give me a choice between a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
when they give me a choice between a
fifty<00:01:39.420> three<00:01:39.540> billion<00:01:39.840> dollar<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.320> deficit<00:01:40.770> in

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
fifty three billion dollar of deficit in

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
fifty three billion dollar of deficit in
the<00:01:40.950> budget<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.400> an<00:01:41.550> eighty<00:01:41.760> billion<00:01:42.030> dollar

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
the budget and an eighty billion dollar

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.780 
the budget and an eighty billion dollar
deficit<00:01:42.930> when<00:01:43.530> budget<00:01:43.979> deficits<00:01:44.490> are<00:01:44.610> what's

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
deficit when budget deficits are what's

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.520 
deficit when budget deficits are what's
causing<00:01:45.090> inflation<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:46.020> don't<00:01:46.290> see<00:01:46.409> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
causing inflation I don't see that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.770 
causing inflation I don't see that
there's<00:01:46.710> any<00:01:46.830> room<00:01:47.010> to<00:01:47.340> be<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:47.940> either<00:01:48.299> side<00:01:48.750> of

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
there's any room to be on either side of

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.110 
there's any room to be on either side of
that<00:01:48.930> argument<00:01:49.100> yeah<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.310> think<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.760> answer<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
that argument yeah I think the answer to

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.860 
that argument yeah I think the answer to
curing<00:01:52.110> inflation<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:52.860> a<00:01:52.890> balanced<00:01:53.400> budget<00:01:53.870> no

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:54.870 
curing inflation is a balanced budget no

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.800 
curing inflation is a balanced budget no
how<00:01:55.740> do<00:01:55.830> you<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.610> mean<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.420> out<00:01:57.570> how

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
how do you do that I mean it's out how

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.000 
how do you do that I mean it's out how
do<00:01:57.870> you<00:01:58.110> balance<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.620> budget

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
do you balance the budget

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.800 
do you balance the budget
well<00:01:59.549> balancing<00:02:00.090> the<00:02:00.210> budget<00:02:00.330> is<00:02:00.659> like

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
well balancing the budget is like

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.060 
well balancing the budget is like
