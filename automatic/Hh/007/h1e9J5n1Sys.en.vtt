hi<00:00:16.840> sage<00:00:17.350> candidate<00:00:17.919> here<00:00:18.189> in<00:00:18.640> today's<00:00:18.970> video

00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:19.419 
hi sage candidate here in today's video

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:20.999 
hi sage candidate here in today's video
we're<00:00:19.750> going<00:00:19.839> to<00:00:19.929> talk<00:00:20.140> about<00:00:20.169> natural

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
we're going to talk about natural

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.980 
we're going to talk about natural
running<00:00:21.279> and<00:00:21.609> I'm<00:00:22.179> going<00:00:22.330> to<00:00:22.359> kind<00:00:22.660> of<00:00:22.720> outline

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:22.990 
running and I'm going to kind of outline

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.710 
running and I'm going to kind of outline
some<00:00:23.650> of<00:00:23.769> the<00:00:23.830> aspects<00:00:24.369> of<00:00:24.609> what<00:00:25.210> that<00:00:25.359> entails

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
some of the aspects of what that entails

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.749 
some of the aspects of what that entails
running<00:00:26.259> is<00:00:26.410> kind<00:00:26.650> of<00:00:26.740> a<00:00:26.859> paradox<00:00:27.070> because

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:27.759 
running is kind of a paradox because

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.409 
running is kind of a paradox because
it's<00:00:28.089> this<00:00:28.599> extremely<00:00:29.169> simple<00:00:29.820> activity<00:00:30.820> but

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
it's this extremely simple activity but

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.360 
it's this extremely simple activity but
at<00:00:31.539> the<00:00:31.630> same<00:00:31.839> time<00:00:32.169> it's<00:00:32.860> also<00:00:33.040> extremely

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
at the same time it's also extremely

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.290 
at the same time it's also extremely
complex<00:00:34.210> from<00:00:34.660> a<00:00:35.130> biomechanical<00:00:36.300> standpoint

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
complex from a biomechanical standpoint

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.910 
complex from a biomechanical standpoint
from<00:00:37.780> a<00:00:37.870> physiological<00:00:38.650> standpoint

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
from a physiological standpoint

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.100 
from a physiological standpoint
hopefully<00:00:39.550> through<00:00:39.790> this<00:00:39.910> video<00:00:40.270> I<00:00:40.570> could

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:41.110 
hopefully through this video I could

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.080 
hopefully through this video I could
outline<00:00:41.740> some<00:00:42.100> key<00:00:42.340> points<00:00:42.610> that<00:00:42.880> I

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:43.090 
outline some key points that I

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:45.360 
outline some key points that I
personally<00:00:43.690> believe<00:00:43.870> will<00:00:44.590> help<00:00:44.740> you<00:00:45.040> develop

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
personally believe will help you develop

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.720 
personally believe will help you develop
a<00:00:45.610> more<00:00:45.880> efficient<00:00:46.560> economical<00:00:47.560> stride<00:00:47.950> that

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
a more efficient economical stride that

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.460 
a more efficient economical stride that
will<00:00:48.910> not<00:00:49.060> only<00:00:49.210> reduce<00:00:49.450> your<00:00:49.840> injury<00:00:50.260> risk

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
will not only reduce your injury risk

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.880 
will not only reduce your injury risk
but<00:00:51.010> will<00:00:51.160> also<00:00:51.400> lead<00:00:51.580> to<00:00:51.610> a<00:00:51.820> faster<00:00:52.300> time<00:00:52.510> and

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
but will also lead to a faster time and

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.760 
but will also lead to a faster time and
more<00:00:53.890> enjoyable<00:00:54.010> running<00:00:58.500> so<00:00:59.500> one<00:00:59.620> of<00:00:59.680> the

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
more enjoyable running so one of the

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.410 
more enjoyable running so one of the
first<00:00:59.890> things<00:01:00.220> you<00:01:00.340> could<00:01:00.520> do<00:01:00.670> to<00:01:00.970> develop<00:01:01.210> a

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
first things you could do to develop a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.660 
first things you could do to develop a
more<00:01:01.540> natural<00:01:01.960> running<00:01:02.230> form<00:01:02.500> is<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:03.250> get<00:01:03.460> a

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
more natural running form is to get a

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.849 
more natural running form is to get a
pair<00:01:03.940> of<00:01:04.180> very<00:01:04.720> low<00:01:05.019> profile

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:05.859 
pair of very low profile

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:08.160 
pair of very low profile
training<00:01:06.280> shoes<00:01:06.549> and<00:01:06.850> what<00:01:07.539> I<00:01:07.570> have<00:01:07.780> here<00:01:08.049> is

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
training shoes and what I have here is

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.800 
training shoes and what I have here is
the<00:01:08.289> Brooks<00:01:08.590> pure<00:01:09.189> flow<00:01:09.520> it's<00:01:10.240> called<00:01:10.570> it's

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
the Brooks pure flow it's called it's

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.739 
the Brooks pure flow it's called it's
it's<00:01:11.200> only<00:01:11.409> one<00:01:11.710> of<00:01:11.950> four<00:01:12.249> in<00:01:12.579> a<00:01:13.030> new<00:01:13.210> line<00:01:13.479> by

it's only one of four in a new line by

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:16.200 
it's only one of four in a new line by
Brooks<00:01:14.380> running<00:01:14.770> called<00:01:15.399> a<00:01:15.520> pure<00:01:15.909> project

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
Brooks running called a pure project

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.999 
Brooks running called a pure project
collection<00:01:17.020> one<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.499> the<00:01:17.619> key<00:01:17.829> design

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
collection one of the key design

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:20.340 
collection one of the key design
features<00:01:18.670> of<00:01:18.969> the<00:01:19.149> Brooks<00:01:19.390> pure<00:01:19.689> project<00:01:19.960> line

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:20.350 
features of the Brooks pure project line

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.620 
features of the Brooks pure project line
is<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.039> fact<00:01:21.280> that<00:01:21.399> they<00:01:21.579> are<00:01:21.700> all<00:01:21.880> very<00:01:22.240> low

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
is the fact that they are all very low

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.260 
is the fact that they are all very low
profile<00:01:23.170> shoes<00:01:23.530> and<00:01:23.859> that<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.999> heel

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
profile shoes and that the heel

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.559 
profile shoes and that the heel
thickness<00:01:25.780> to<00:01:26.679> the<00:01:26.890> mid<00:01:27.340> foot<00:01:27.549> thickness<00:01:28.060> is<00:01:28.270> a

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
thickness to the mid foot thickness is a

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:32.039 
thickness to the mid foot thickness is a
very<00:01:29.079> low<00:01:29.439> drop<00:01:29.999> on<00:01:30.999> all<00:01:31.060> the<00:01:31.359> shoes<00:01:31.539> it's<00:01:31.749> four

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
very low drop on all the shoes it's four

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:33.660 
very low drop on all the shoes it's four
millimeters<00:01:32.649> which<00:01:32.859> is<00:01:33.009> basically<00:01:33.399> nothing

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
millimeters which is basically nothing

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.300 
millimeters which is basically nothing
so<00:01:34.600> the<00:01:34.689> idea<00:01:34.960> is<00:01:35.139> that<00:01:35.170> you<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.590> land<00:01:35.799> more<00:01:36.159> up

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
so the idea is that you can land more up

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.090 
so the idea is that you can land more up
on<00:01:36.490> the<00:01:36.789> midsole<00:01:37.469> front<00:01:38.469> part<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:38.770> the<00:01:38.859> shoe

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
on the midsole front part of the shoe

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.330 
on the midsole front part of the shoe
rather<00:01:39.789> than<00:01:40.149> the<00:01:40.749> thick<00:01:40.990> heel<00:01:41.350> like<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.069> some

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
rather than the thick heel like in some

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.489 
rather than the thick heel like in some
overly<00:01:42.850> cushioned<00:01:43.299> shoes<00:01:43.539> that<00:01:44.079> kind<00:01:44.350> of

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:44.499 
overly cushioned shoes that kind of

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:47.309 
overly cushioned shoes that kind of
reinforce<00:01:45.459> poor<00:01:45.789> form<00:01:46.179> a<00:01:46.420> poor<00:01:46.689> heel<00:01:46.959> strike

00:01:47.309 --> 00:01:47.319 
reinforce poor form a poor heel strike

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:48.929 
reinforce poor form a poor heel strike
which<00:01:47.770> I'll<00:01:47.920> show<00:01:48.130> you<00:01:48.159> later<00:01:48.249> in<00:01:48.670> this<00:01:48.759> video

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:48.939 
which I'll show you later in this video

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:51.539 
which I'll show you later in this video
so<00:01:49.840> the<00:01:49.990> Brooks<00:01:50.170> pure<00:01:50.590> project<00:01:50.859> line<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.520> a

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:51.549 
so the Brooks pure project line is a

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:53.459 
so the Brooks pure project line is a
really<00:01:52.060> good<00:01:52.209> example<00:01:52.329> because<00:01:52.840> it's<00:01:53.170> got<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
really good example because it's got the

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.319 
really good example because it's got the
low<00:01:53.590> profile<00:01:54.130> it's<00:01:54.759> a<00:01:54.880> relatively

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:55.329 
low profile it's a relatively

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:57.899 
low profile it's a relatively
lightweight<00:01:55.719> shoe<00:01:56.289> it's<00:01:56.859> real<00:01:57.159> flexible<00:01:57.759> it's

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
lightweight shoe it's real flexible it's

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.789 
lightweight shoe it's real flexible it's
going<00:01:58.060> to<00:01:58.119> allow<00:01:58.359> a<00:01:58.630> more<00:01:58.869> natural<00:01:59.350> movement

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 
going to allow a more natural movement

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:02.910 
going to allow a more natural movement
more<00:02:00.279> natural<00:02:00.749> toe<00:02:01.749> off<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.319> if<00:02:02.619> you<00:02:02.709> want<00:02:02.859> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
more natural toe off and if you want to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.489 
more natural toe off and if you want to
learn<00:02:03.039> more<00:02:03.219> about<00:02:03.520> this<00:02:03.909> shoe<00:02:04.119> in<00:02:04.270> particular

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
slightly bent it's not a heel strike so

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.530 
slightly bent it's not a heel strike so
Newton's<00:02:58.310> third<00:02:58.550> law<00:02:58.580> for<00:02:59.150> a<00:02:59.180> reaction

Newton's third law for a reaction

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.560 
Newton's third law for a reaction
there's<00:03:00.500> an<00:03:00.650> equal<00:03:01.040> and<00:03:01.190> opposite<00:03:01.730> reaction

there's an equal and opposite reaction

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.530 
there's an equal and opposite reaction
so<00:03:03.020> you're<00:03:03.620> coming<00:03:03.800> down<00:03:04.100> at<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:05.270> angle

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
so you're coming down at this angle

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.810 
so you're coming down at this angle
you're<00:03:06.290> going<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.620> braking<00:03:07.250> force<00:03:07.520> coming

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820 
you're going to get braking force coming

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:10.090 
you're going to get braking force coming
straight<00:03:08.120> back<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:09.050> way<00:03:09.260> you<00:03:09.770> want<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.010> go

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
straight back that way you want to go

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.210 
straight back that way you want to go
that<00:03:10.280> way<00:03:10.460> but<00:03:11.090> you're<00:03:11.360> coming<00:03:11.660> down<00:03:12.040> over<00:03:13.040> top

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:13.220 
that way but you're coming down over top

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.120 
that way but you're coming down over top
and<00:03:14.030> moving<00:03:14.300> over<00:03:14.710> your<00:03:15.710> body's<00:03:16.010> already

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
and moving over your body's already

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:18.340 
and moving over your body's already
moving<00:03:16.550> forward<00:03:17.180> there's<00:03:17.840> less<00:03:18.080> of<00:03:18.110> that

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
moving forward there's less of that

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.820 
moving forward there's less of that
jarring<00:03:19.150> reactionary<00:03:20.150> force<00:03:20.510> coming<00:03:21.320> back<00:03:21.500> so

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
jarring reactionary force coming back so

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:25.300 
jarring reactionary force coming back so
I<00:03:21.890> plant<00:03:22.780> pull<00:03:23.780> over<00:03:23.990> when<00:03:24.590> I'll<00:03:24.740> always<00:03:24.950> think

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:25.310 
I plant pull over when I'll always think

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.950 
I plant pull over when I'll always think
that<00:03:25.520> you're<00:03:25.700> lifting<00:03:25.910> your<00:03:26.300> leg<00:03:26.480> up<00:03:26.690> and

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:26.960 
that you're lifting your leg up and

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:31.060 
that you're lifting your leg up and
bringing<00:03:27.950> it<00:03:28.070> over<00:03:28.540> with<00:03:29.540> each<00:03:29.690> back<00:03:29.960> kick<00:03:30.290> but

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:31.070 
bringing it over with each back kick but

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:33.250 
bringing it over with each back kick but
it's<00:03:31.220> nice<00:03:31.460> and<00:03:31.700> light<00:03:31.880> action<00:03:32.120> so<00:03:32.600> you're

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:33.260 
it's nice and light action so you're

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.290 
it's nice and light action so you're
just<00:03:33.350> kind<00:03:33.530> of<00:03:33.620> kicking<00:03:33.890> it<00:03:34.040> up<00:03:34.190> pulling<00:03:35.120> it

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:35.300 
just kind of kicking it up pulling it

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:37.270 
just kind of kicking it up pulling it
over<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.900> then<00:03:36.410> you're<00:03:36.530> flying<00:03:36.830> across<00:03:37.160> the

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.280 
over and then you're flying across the

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.120 
over and then you're flying across the
ground<00:03:37.730> so<00:03:38.600> your<00:03:39.380> foots<00:03:39.620> are<00:03:39.710> already<00:03:40.010> moving

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
ground so your foots are already moving

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:56.570 
ground so your foots are already moving
back<00:03:40.630> as<00:03:41.630> it's<00:03:41.900> hitting<00:03:42.050> the<00:03:42.140> ground

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.930 

and<00:03:57.180> if<00:03:57.840> you're<00:03:57.990> taking<00:03:58.350> you<00:03:59.040> know<00:03:59.130> 180<00:03:59.700> steps

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
and if you're taking you know 180 steps

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.390 
and if you're taking you know 180 steps
a<00:04:00.120> minute<00:04:00.420> and<00:04:01.320> it's<00:04:01.470> nice<00:04:01.650> and<00:04:01.680> light<00:04:01.920> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
a minute and it's nice and light and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.550 
a minute and it's nice and light and
that's<00:04:02.940> what's<00:04:03.210> going<00:04:03.390> to<00:04:03.450> help<00:04:04.140> save<00:04:04.380> your

that's what's going to help save your

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:15.400 
that's what's going to help save your
joints<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.610> doing<00:04:14.880> drills<00:04:15.150> like<00:04:15.240> this

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
joints so just doing drills like this

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:17.930

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
cadence is going to help build that

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.310 
cadence is going to help build that
neuromuscular<00:04:20.430> connection<00:04:21.049> for<00:04:22.049> you<00:04:22.110> to<00:04:22.200> get

neuromuscular connection for you to get

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.270 
neuromuscular connection for you to get
that<00:04:22.410> kind<00:04:22.620> of<00:04:22.680> speed

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 
that kind of speed

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.040 
that kind of speed
furthermore<00:04:23.850> if<00:04:24.420> you're<00:04:24.720> if<00:04:24.990> you're

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.050 
furthermore if you're if you're

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.290 
furthermore if you're if you're
springing<00:04:25.590> up<00:04:25.680> into<00:04:25.860> there<00:04:26.040> too<00:04:26.340> high<00:04:26.550> you're

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
springing up into there too high you're

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.370 
springing up into there too high you're
getting<00:04:27.480> too<00:04:27.630> much<00:04:27.690> vertical<00:04:28.170> oscillation

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
getting too much vertical oscillation

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.520 
getting too much vertical oscillation
too<00:04:29.340> much<00:04:29.520> up<00:04:29.700> and<00:04:29.940> down<00:04:30.090> movement<00:04:30.380> you<00:04:31.380> want

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:31.530 
too much up and down movement you want

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.990 
too much up and down movement you want
to<00:04:31.590> keep<00:04:31.680> most<00:04:31.890> of<00:04:31.950> your<00:04:32.070> movement<00:04:32.400> heading

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
to keep most of your movement heading

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.940 
to keep most of your movement heading
forward<00:04:33.330> so<00:04:34.020> that<00:04:34.140> usually<00:04:34.320> is<00:04:34.560> gonna<00:04:34.680> require

forward so that usually is gonna require

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.940 
forward so that usually is gonna require
a<00:04:35.280> slight<00:04:35.790> forward<00:04:36.240> lean<00:04:36.680> kind<00:04:37.680> of<00:04:37.770> at<00:04:37.860> the

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
a slight forward lean kind of at the
