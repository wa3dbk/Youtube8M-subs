00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.510 
prefer the Navy now spring shoes always
come<00:02:39.360> with<00:02:39.510> three<00:02:39.780> laces<00:02:40.140> or<00:02:40.260> at<00:02:40.350> least<00:02:40.520> most

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
come with three laces or at least most

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.940 
come with three laces or at least most
of<00:02:41.580> them<00:02:41.760> do<00:02:41.880> so<00:02:42.720> I've<00:02:43.020> actually<00:02:43.350> had<00:02:43.740> one

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
of them do so I've actually had one

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:47.030 
of them do so I've actually had one
other<00:02:44.070> color<00:02:44.310> which<00:02:45.060> is<00:02:45.330> black<00:02:45.810> laces<00:02:46.290> but

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
other color which is black laces but

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.190 
other color which is black laces but
black<00:02:47.790> laces<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.480> personally<00:02:49.050> don't<00:02:49.170> think

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
black laces I personally don't think

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.510 
black laces I personally don't think
would<00:02:49.380> be<00:02:49.440> a<00:02:49.470> good<00:02:49.620> choice<00:02:49.800> because<00:02:50.100> there's

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
would be a good choice because there's

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.610 
would be a good choice because there's
no<00:02:51.090> other<00:02:51.210> black<00:02:51.420> in<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.660> shoe<00:02:51.840> so<00:02:52.410> that's<00:02:52.530> why

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
no other black in the shoe so that's why

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.350 
no other black in the shoe so that's why
I<00:02:52.650> didn't<00:02:52.800> put<00:02:52.920> these<00:02:53.010> on<00:02:53.190> there<00:02:53.370> but<00:02:53.940> you<00:02:54.240> know

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
I didn't put these on there but you know

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.030 
I didn't put these on there but you know
maybe<00:02:54.510> that's<00:02:54.720> your<00:02:54.810> thing

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
maybe that's your thing

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.980 
maybe that's your thing

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
think for me personally it's a very

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.050 
think for me personally it's a very
historic<00:04:46.380> shoe<00:04:47.070> because<00:04:47.280> it's<00:04:47.670> the<00:04:47.820> first

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
historic shoe because it's the first

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.780 
historic shoe because it's the first
shoe<00:04:48.330> ever<00:04:48.570> given<00:04:48.960> to<00:04:49.170> a<00:04:49.530> company<00:04:50.490> that<00:04:50.700> was

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:50.790 
shoe ever given to a company that was

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.980 
shoe ever given to a company that was
completely<00:04:51.300> designed<00:04:51.570> from<00:04:51.630> the<00:04:51.750> ground<00:04:51.780> up

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:51.990 
completely designed from the ground up

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.570 
completely designed from the ground up
just<00:04:52.230> for<00:04:52.350> them<00:04:52.470> so<00:04:52.920> I<00:04:52.980> thought<00:04:53.130> that<00:04:53.280> was<00:04:53.340> sick

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
just for them so I thought that was sick

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.530 
just for them so I thought that was sick
I<00:04:53.700> hope<00:04:53.880> they<00:04:54.000> come<00:04:54.090> out<00:04:54.180> with<00:04:54.270> some<00:04:54.330> other

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:54.540 
I hope they come out with some other

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:55.940 
I hope they come out with some other
colors<00:04:54.780> of<00:04:54.930> this<00:04:55.050> shoe<00:04:55.200> because<00:04:55.590> I<00:04:55.770> really

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:55.950 
colors of this shoe because I really

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:57.200 
colors of this shoe because I really
like<00:04:56.040> the<00:04:56.160> overall<00:04:56.250> makeup<00:04:56.640> of<00:04:56.910> it<00:04:57.060> and<00:04:57.180> I

00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:57.210 
like the overall makeup of it and I

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:59.270 
like the overall makeup of it and I
