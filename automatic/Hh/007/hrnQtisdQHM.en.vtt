00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.840
 so now we look at each other 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.690
 quest here is about it 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.920
 fire bowls in the right color too 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
 Ignite before all things in the 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.070
 correct order and therefore must 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.000
 we look at a memory i 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.000
 have us on 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:32.520
 so red orange green blue or whatever 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:37.440
 always seems to seem that way 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:39.830
 the memory looks like that 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.340
 to be the mother that a warrior 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:45.989
 and 42 others 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.750
 the mother was protect he has her well 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.930
 They were killed , they wanted the son 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.900
 pick up and the son then beats well 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.180
 and so we ignite the bowls 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:00.239
 I'll show you that here and so on 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.489
 we are in a room and you see by 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
 there is a woman standing there to the north 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.380
 So the woman there as the first 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.380
 shows and has the bottom of the 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:15.600
 Reminder stood here 

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:18.680
 So now we light the times of the 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:24.260
 moment here was the lining red exactly 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:27.730
 and here was the mother 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:31.520
 which were namely the 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:34.190
 So the red guy gets it 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.620
 mother killed here was the son of 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:41.150
 the knees lay and there was the woman the 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:42.920
 with outstretched arm with people 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.790
 here still on his knees are the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.790
 turn on 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.930
 Thank you for reminding me 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.890
 Dear sir, you have mine 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.300
 blessing 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:01.570
 Now you have to go to aliki 

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.310
 so yes he has understood the north 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:07.550
 and you have to stand down there 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.560
 turn everything on okay and that too 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.560
 was already the second puzzle solution
