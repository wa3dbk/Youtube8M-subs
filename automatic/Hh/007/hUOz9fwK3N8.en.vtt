end<00:00:46.039> up<00:00:46.309> I've<00:00:46.789> noticed<00:00:47.210> though<00:00:47.420> the<00:00:48.050> longer

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:48.229 
end up I've noticed though the longer

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:52.270 
end up I've noticed though the longer
things<00:00:48.559> stay<00:00:48.979> in<00:00:49.129> the<00:00:49.249> refrigerator<00:00:51.280> these

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:52.280 
things stay in the refrigerator these

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.360 
things stay in the refrigerator these
spices<00:00:52.609> break<00:00:53.210> down<00:00:53.389> over<00:00:53.569> time<00:00:53.659> so<00:00:54.370> hopefully

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
spices break down over time so hopefully

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.889 
spices break down over time so hopefully
it<00:00:55.639> won't<00:00:55.699> be<00:00:55.819> too<00:00:55.879> sickening<00:00:56.269> hot<00:00:56.629> but

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
it won't be too sickening hot but

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.509 
it won't be too sickening hot but

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
up I'm not gonna be dehydrating and how

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.380 
up I'm not gonna be dehydrating and how
it's<00:01:25.130> just<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:25.430> case<00:01:25.610> it's<00:01:25.820> got<00:01:25.970> that<00:01:26.180> crazy

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
it's just in case it's got that crazy

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.310 
it's just in case it's got that crazy
spicy<00:01:26.780> factor<00:01:27.700> a<00:01:28.700> lot<00:01:29.420> of<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:29.630> fumes<00:01:29.990> and

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
spicy factor a lot of the fumes and

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.010 
spicy factor a lot of the fumes and
vapors<00:01:30.410> that<00:01:31.040> come<00:01:31.220> off<00:01:31.370> of<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:31.640> stuff

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
vapors that come off of this stuff

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.140 
vapors that come off of this stuff
actually<00:01:33.020> will<00:01:33.230> burn<00:01:33.560> your<00:01:33.800> eyes<00:01:34.150> eventually

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
actually will burn your eyes eventually

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.270 
actually will burn your eyes eventually
if<00:01:35.300> they<00:01:35.420> build<00:01:35.660> up<00:01:35.840> long<00:01:36.620> enough<00:01:36.740> in<00:01:37.100> a

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
if they build up long enough in a

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.610 
if they build up long enough in a
contained<00:01:38.030> space<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:38.630> I'm<00:01:39.230> gonna<00:01:39.350> do<00:01:39.470> it<00:01:39.530> down

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:39.620 
contained space so I'm gonna do it down

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.940 
contained space so I'm gonna do it down
garage<00:01:40.330> so<00:01:41.330> anyway<00:01:41.540> get<00:01:42.500> this<00:01:42.680> stuff<00:01:42.860> loaded

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950

garage and we'll take it from there okay

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.550 
garage and we'll take it from there okay
so<00:01:48.350> we<00:01:48.800> got<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.250> trays<00:01:49.730> loaded<00:01:50.300> back<00:01:50.540> up<00:01:50.780> and

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:51.560 
so we got the trays loaded back up and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.500 
so we got the trays loaded back up and
I'm<00:01:51.740> pretty<00:01:52.130> big<00:01:52.280> pieces<00:01:52.490> it's<00:01:53.180> kind<00:01:53.300> of<00:01:53.330> hard

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:53.510 
I'm pretty big pieces it's kind of hard

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.860 
I'm pretty big pieces it's kind of hard
to<00:01:53.540> tell<00:01:54.610> but<00:01:55.610> like<00:01:56.030> this<00:01:56.210> piece<00:01:56.450> here<00:01:56.720> is

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:56.870 
to tell but like this piece here is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.600 
to tell but like this piece here is
probably

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.330 

four<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.900> a<00:02:00.960> half<00:02:01.020> five<00:02:01.290> inches<00:02:01.590> long<00:02:01.800> so

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
four and a half five inches long so

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.930 
four and a half five inches long so
they're<00:02:02.670> pretty<00:02:02.820> large<00:02:03.090> pieces<00:02:03.480> of<00:02:04.670> not<00:02:05.670> use

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:05.940 
they're pretty large pieces of not use

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.820 
they're pretty large pieces of not use
this<00:02:06.180> particular<00:02:06.480> cut<00:02:06.990> of<00:02:07.110> meat<00:02:07.380> before

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
this particular cut of meat before

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.240 
this particular cut of meat before
usually<00:02:08.010> I'll<00:02:08.400> use<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:08.970> London<00:02:09.300> broil<00:02:09.570> or

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
usually I'll use like a London broil or

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.340 
usually I'll use like a London broil or
something<00:02:11.250> like<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.640> but<00:02:12.120> does<00:02:12.660> the<00:02:13.020> top

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
something like that but does the top

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.280 
something like that but does the top
round<00:02:13.640> roast<00:02:14.640> so<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.510> pieces<00:02:15.720> are<00:02:15.870> much<00:02:16.080> more

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
round roast so the pieces are much more

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.520 
round roast so the pieces are much more
round<00:02:16.730> top<00:02:17.730> round<00:02:17.940> there<00:02:18.300> you<00:02:18.420> go

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
round top round there you go

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:24.080 
round top round there you go
but<00:02:20.280> anyway<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:23.400> gonna<00:02:23.520> take<00:02:23.700> it<00:02:23.730> out<00:02:23.880> to<00:02:24.030> the

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
but anyway I'm gonna take it out to the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.480 
but anyway I'm gonna take it out to the
garage<00:02:24.560> get<00:02:25.560> her<00:02:25.650> started<00:02:26.450> probably<00:02:27.450> run<00:02:27.660> it

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
garage get her started probably run it

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:44.930 
big tono jerky I had to run out of the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:48.070 
big tono jerky I had to run out of the
house<00:04:45.139> and<00:04:45.590> do<00:04:46.159> a<00:04:46.190> bunch<00:04:46.400> of<00:04:46.520> stuff<00:04:47.080> family

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
house and do a bunch of stuff family

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:54.969 
house and do a bunch of stuff family
kind<00:04:48.349> of<00:04:48.409> things<00:04:50.770> but<00:04:53.440> timer<00:04:54.440> turned<00:04:54.770> off

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
kind of things but timer turned off

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:58.719 
kind of things but timer turned off
after<00:04:55.520> five<00:04:55.970> and<00:04:56.570> a<00:04:56.630> half<00:04:57.320> hours<00:04:58.190> I<00:04:58.400> think<00:04:58.460> it

00:04:58.719 --> 00:04:58.729 
after five and a half hours I think it

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:02.409 
after five and a half hours I think it
was<00:04:58.909> total<00:04:59.449> and<00:05:00.789> right<00:05:01.789> before<00:05:02.060> I<00:05:02.090> left<00:05:02.270> the

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
was total and right before I left the

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.180 
was total and right before I left the
house<00:05:02.599> I<00:05:03.280> turned<00:05:04.280> the<00:05:04.940> heat<00:05:05.240> down<00:05:05.270> from<00:05:06.190> about

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:07.190 
house I turned the heat down from about

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.370 
house I turned the heat down from about
150<00:05:07.580> down<00:05:08.060> to<00:05:08.300> I<00:05:08.810> think<00:05:09.139> it<00:05:09.199> was<00:05:09.289> probably

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
150 down to I think it was probably

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.720 
150 down to I think it was probably
about<00:05:09.620> 135<00:05:10.340> and<00:05:10.849> it's<00:05:11.690> probably<00:05:11.900> one<00:05:12.110> another

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
about 135 and it's probably one another

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:19.380 
about 135 and it's probably one another
and<00:05:13.030> a<00:05:13.180> half<00:05:13.480> on<00:05:14.170> what<00:05:14.380> I<00:05:14.410> recall<00:05:18.120> you<00:05:19.120> couldn't

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:19.390 
and a half on what I recall you couldn't

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:29.160 
and a half on what I recall you couldn't
get<00:05:19.510> into<00:05:19.750> this<00:05:19.870> one-handed<00:05:23.400> bag<00:05:26.040> yeah<00:05:27.040> a<00:05:28.170> guy

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:29.170 
get into this one-handed bag yeah a guy

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:31.560
