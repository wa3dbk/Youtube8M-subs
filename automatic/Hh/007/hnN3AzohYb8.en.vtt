00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
they looked or how different they look

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.430 
they looked or how different they look

I've played modern warfare 2 and it was

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.590 
I've played modern warfare 2 and it was
just<00:01:03.750> so<00:01:04.080> different<00:01:04.559> from<00:01:05.100> any<00:01:05.939> call<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.330> duty

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
just so different from any call of duty

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.990 
just so different from any call of duty

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it's called duty 4 but they really

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.740 
it's called duty 4 but they really
stepped<00:01:11.250> up<00:01:11.490> the<00:01:11.700> game<00:01:11.729> and<00:01:12.150> added<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.540> lot<00:01:12.689> of

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.120 
similar you know you move and just how
somewhere<00:01:28.049> the<00:01:28.170> screen<00:01:28.470> looks<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.770> know<00:01:28.829> a<00:01:28.920> lot

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
somewhere the screen looks I know a lot

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.399 
somewhere the screen looks I know a lot
of<00:01:29.159> its<00:01:29.340> cut<00:01:29.549> off<00:01:29.729> but<00:01:30.030> that's<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.049> only<00:01:31.229> way<00:01:31.350> I

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
of its cut off but that's the only way I

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
of its cut off but that's the only way I
can<00:01:31.530> do<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:31.770> in<00:01:31.920> iMovie<00:01:32.430> I<00:01:32.460> can't<00:01:33.180> put<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> full

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
can do it in iMovie I can't put the full

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.819 
can do it in iMovie I can't put the full
screen<00:01:34.710> of<00:01:34.829> both<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.340> would<00:01:35.579> be<00:01:35.729> nice<00:01:35.909> but

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
screen of both which would be nice but

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:39.440 
screen of both which would be nice but
unfortunately<00:01:37.829> can't<00:01:38.100> but<00:01:38.369> you<00:01:38.759> know<00:01:39.299> they

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
unfortunately can't but you know they

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.350 
unfortunately can't but you know they
use<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> same<00:01:39.990> text<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.000> you<00:01:42.000> know<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.119> guess

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
use the same text and you know I guess

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.330 
use the same text and you know I guess
so<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.600> movements<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.200> same<00:01:43.470> the<00:01:43.770> gun<00:01:44.040> is

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
so the movements the same the gun is

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.520 
so the movements the same the gun is
exactly<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> same<00:01:45.450> pretty<00:01:45.720> much<00:01:45.899> sounds<00:01:46.380> the

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
exactly the same pretty much sounds the

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
exactly the same pretty much sounds the
same<00:01:47.659> graphics<00:01:48.659> really<00:01:50.180> honestly<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.450> me<00:01:51.479> the

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
same graphics really honestly to me the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.260 
same graphics really honestly to me the

thoughts play the game some more today
it's<00:02:10.600> to<00:02:11.530> me<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:11.680> pretty<00:02:11.950> disappointing

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:12.190 
it's to me it's pretty disappointing

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
it's to me it's pretty disappointing
it's<00:02:12.970> just<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:14.620> me<00:02:14.770> it's<00:02:15.730> all<00:02:15.910> about<00:02:15.940> the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:16.210 
it's just to me it's all about the

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.260 
it's just to me it's all about the
killstreaks<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.110> and<00:02:18.060> really<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.210> only

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.270 
killstreaks again and really the only

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.180 
killstreaks again and really the only
thing<00:02:19.570> that's<00:02:19.750> changes<00:02:20.290> is<00:02:20.470> the<00:02:20.500> maps<00:02:20.890> are<00:02:21.130> a

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:21.190 
thing that's changes is the maps are a

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.640 
thing that's changes is the maps are a
lot<00:02:21.400> smaller<00:02:21.730> now<00:02:22.090> and<00:02:22.390> there's<00:02:23.320> a<00:02:23.410> lot<00:02:23.590> of

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
lot smaller now and there's a lot of

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.340 
lot smaller now and there's a lot of
buildings<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:25.420> can't<00:02:25.630> really<00:02:25.780> go<00:02:25.990> into<00:02:26.020> the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
buildings you can't really go into the

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:28.830 
buildings you can't really go into the
buildings<00:02:26.710> but<00:02:27.040> at<00:02:27.520> the<00:02:27.640> same<00:02:27.850> time<00:02:28.120> if

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
buildings but at the same time if

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.800 
buildings but at the same time if
there's<00:02:29.050> a<00:02:29.140> lot<00:02:29.350> of<00:02:29.380> it's<00:02:29.860> very<00:02:30.190> tight<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.810> you

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
there's a lot of it's very tight and you

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.920 
there's a lot of it's very tight and you
know<00:02:31.930> you<00:02:31.990> killed<00:02:32.440> around<00:02:32.710> corners<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> lot<00:02:33.520> and

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
know you killed around corners a lot and

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.620 
know you killed around corners a lot and
you<00:02:34.930> seem<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.170> die<00:02:35.640> maybe<00:02:36.640> not<00:02:36.820> a<00:02:36.880> lot<00:02:36.970> faster

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
you seem to die maybe not a lot faster

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.180 
you seem to die maybe not a lot faster
but<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.960> definitely<00:02:38.140> die<00:02:38.380> faster<00:02:38.860> and<00:02:38.980> modern

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190 
but you definitely die faster and modern

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.740 
but you definitely die faster and modern
warfare<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.670> read<00:02:40.710> so<00:02:41.710> it<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:43.180> makes<00:02:43.480> for<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
warfare to read so it it makes for a

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.990 
warfare to read so it it makes for a
very<00:02:43.780> fast<00:02:44.260> pace<00:02:44.380> game<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:45.250> at<00:02:45.370> the<00:02:45.490> same<00:02:45.700> time

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
very fast pace game but at the same time

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.060 
very fast pace game but at the same time
it's<00:02:46.540> there's<00:02:47.080> just<00:02:47.170> not<00:02:47.410> too<00:02:47.680> many<00:02:47.890> open
