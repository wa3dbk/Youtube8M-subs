00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
time a bit of biosphere is ready I took

demands<00:01:23.770> we've<00:01:24.770> been<00:01:24.950> studying<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:25.459> pond<00:01:25.700> for

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
demands we've been studying the pond for

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.410 
demands we've been studying the pond for
two<00:01:26.060> weeks

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
two weeks

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.859 
two weeks
and<00:01:26.920> we<00:01:27.920> learned<00:01:28.190> that<00:01:28.310> the<00:01:28.940> frogs<00:01:29.240> are<00:01:29.599> dying

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
and we learned that the frogs are dying

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.930 
and we learned that the frogs are dying
in<00:01:30.110> here<00:01:30.349> because<00:01:30.649> there's<00:01:31.009> no<00:01:31.190> escape<00:01:31.580> routes

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.390 

this<00:01:34.660> grumble<00:01:35.140> will<00:01:35.380> allow<00:01:35.620> the<00:01:35.680> frogs<00:01:36.130> to

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
this grumble will allow the frogs to

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:44.550 
this grumble will allow the frogs to
reach<00:01:36.580> land<00:01:41.040> right<00:01:42.420> next<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.570> nature<00:01:43.990> and<00:01:44.290> so

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
reach land right next to nature and so

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.010 
reach land right next to nature and so
you<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.370> just<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:45.640> look<00:01:46.060> out<00:01:46.210> your<00:01:46.720> wall

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
you can just like look out your wall

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.620 
you can just like look out your wall
nice<00:01:47.470> nature<00:01:47.710> right<00:01:48.220> there<00:01:51.090> solar<00:01:52.090> panels

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630
