00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello everyone in today's video I 'm going 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.140
 to show three ways to light a fire 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.140
 easier 

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.990
 and in the first form it is quite 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.880
 simple surely you have a 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.590
 dryer in your house and the fluff that 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.940
 remains of the washing machine is perfect for 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.130
 start a game so they can 

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:27.690
 save it in your survival kit and 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.690
 use it to light the fire easier 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.320
 it is quite flammable the other way of 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.450
 start a super easy game is 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
 using fine metal fiber like this 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:38.450
 which are used to wash generally 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.860
 we are also going to need a battery 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.170
 square I say that you have to do is 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.270
 open up our metal fiber and 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.840
 stick the battery for a few seconds 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:47.840
 and so 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.640
 we can turn on any game we have 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.440
 fire in the following way to start 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.150
 fire surely many of you in 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.980
 house they will be able to find cotton and 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.790
 hand sanitizer the only thing 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.410
 you have to do is lend a little 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.120
 only with our cotton 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:07.110
 and it will light up and it will last 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.110
 on more time 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.180
 also if you wish you can use 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.010
 Vaseline well these are the three forms 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.720
 to light fire easier you know if 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.460

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.490
 done and see you in the next and 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.840
 share this video with all your 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.840
 friends that would help me a lot 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.090
 this method of setting fire I learned it 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:35.159
 when I was in the war of vietnam and 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
 there were many batteries 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.110
 square and the love for kilos we are going to 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.670
 put some metal and unripe 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.590
 the help of a square stack that 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.860
 abounded in the war in which I 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.860
 I was 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:53.690
 let's light the fire that concerns us 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.690
 At this precise moment 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:12.800
 but all dark and white
