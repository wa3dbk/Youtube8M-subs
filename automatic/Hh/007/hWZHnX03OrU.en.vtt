like<00:01:07.080> playing<00:01:07.320> Minecraft<00:01:07.500> and<00:01:08.040> stuff<00:01:08.479> try<00:01:09.479> try

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
like playing Minecraft and stuff try try

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.289 
like playing Minecraft and stuff try try
not<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.220> have<00:01:11.310> any<00:01:11.430> black<00:01:11.729> bars<00:01:11.939> but<00:01:12.210> they

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
not to have any black bars but they

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:13.490 
not to have any black bars but they
don't<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:12.570> make<00:01:12.659> much<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:12.990> a<00:01:13.170> difference

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
don't really make much of a difference

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.289 
don't really make much of a difference
it<00:01:13.770> just<00:01:13.979> I<00:01:14.159> think<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.490> video<00:01:14.760> looks<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.150> lot

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
it just I think the video looks a lot

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.810 
it just I think the video looks a lot
better<00:01:15.540> if<00:01:16.110> you<00:01:16.320> don't<00:01:16.409> flop<00:01:16.680> bars<00:01:16.860> and<00:01:17.100> try

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
better if you don't flop bars and try

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.390 
better if you don't flop bars and try
and<00:01:17.880> try<00:01:18.420> not<00:01:18.659> to<00:01:18.780> make<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.020> quality<00:01:19.409> bud<00:01:19.830> we
