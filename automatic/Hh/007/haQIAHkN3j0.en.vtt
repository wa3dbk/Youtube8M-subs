notes the room so from there let's think

notes the room so from there let's think
of<00:00:51.930> all<00:00:52.260> of<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:53.010> just<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.940> idea<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.870> I<00:00:55.079> have

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
of all of this just the idea that I have

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.799 
of all of this just the idea that I have
my<00:00:55.649> Center<00:00:56.129> I'm<00:00:56.280> sinner<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.270> could<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.600> right

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
my Center I'm sinner I could be right

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.950 
my Center I'm sinner I could be right
now<00:00:57.960> I'm<00:00:58.020> sitting<00:00:58.320> on<00:00:58.530> both<00:00:58.770> my<00:00:59.010> feet<00:00:59.219> so<00:01:00.120> even

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
now I'm sitting on both my feet so even

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.900 
now I'm sitting on both my feet so even
though<00:01:01.079> I'm<00:01:01.379> moving<00:01:01.620> all<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> this<00:01:02.430> is<00:01:02.640> still

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
though I'm moving all of this is still

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.230 
though I'm moving all of this is still
on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.390> idea<00:01:03.870> of<00:01:04.170> around<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.369> world<00:01:05.640> like

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
on the idea of around the world like

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.380 
on the idea of around the world like
just<00:01:06.510> learning<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> move<00:01:07.409> yourself<00:01:08.130> around

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:08.390 
just learning to move yourself around

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.390 
just learning to move yourself around
yourself<00:01:09.390> but<00:01:10.200> do<00:01:10.350> we<00:01:10.470> want<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.740> get<00:01:10.860> into<00:01:11.010> more

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
yourself but do we want to get into more

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.210 
yourself but do we want to get into more
specifically<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.630> L<00:01:12.900> still<00:01:13.409> so<00:01:13.860> let's<00:01:14.040> talk

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
specifically the L still so let's talk

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.420 
specifically the L still so let's talk
about<00:01:14.280> there<00:01:14.850> you<00:01:15.659> have<00:01:16.280> stepping<00:01:17.280> directly

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
about there you have stepping directly

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.899 
about there you have stepping directly
in<00:01:18.060> front<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.960> ideal<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.590> clock<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:20.759> would

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
in front the ideal of a clock this would

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.320 
in front the ideal of a clock this would
be<00:01:21.030> the<00:01:21.119> twelve<00:01:21.420> stepping<00:01:22.229> out<00:01:22.350> some<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.680> three

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
be the twelve stepping out some to three

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.480 
be the twelve stepping out some to three
stepping<00:01:24.330> back<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.720> six<00:01:25.400> stepping<00:01:26.400> over

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
stepping back to the six stepping over

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.109 
stepping back to the six stepping over
to<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.909> ninth<00:01:27.409> offset<00:01:28.409> over<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:29.430> again<00:01:29.490> other

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
to the ninth offset over you again other

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:38.030 
to the ninth offset over you again other
foot<00:01:30.540> 12<00:01:31.939> 9<00:01:32.939> 6<00:01:33.890> 3<00:01:35.479> and<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:37.380> can<00:01:37.560> cross<00:01:37.740> one<00:01:38.009> foot

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
foot 12 9 6 3 and you can cross one foot

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.130 
foot 12 9 6 3 and you can cross one foot
in<00:01:38.310> front<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:39.000> we're<00:01:39.210> still<00:01:39.450> standing<00:01:39.780> right

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
in front so we're still standing right

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.929 
in front so we're still standing right
here<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.799> haven't<00:01:41.100> got<00:01:41.220> into<00:01:41.340> an<00:01:41.579> actual

here we haven't got into an actual

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.910 
here we haven't got into an actual

devote<00:01:44.369> we're<00:01:44.880> still<00:01:45.090> standing<00:01:45.390> right<00:01:45.630> now

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
devote we're still standing right now

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.230 
devote we're still standing right now
the<00:01:46.259> idea<00:01:46.619> of<00:01:46.770> taking<00:01:46.950> it<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.610> did<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.820> quarter

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
the idea of taking it we did a quarter

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.420 
the idea of taking it we did a quarter
balance<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.960> simple<00:01:49.549> one<00:01:50.549> three<00:01:51.450> five<00:01:52.320> seven

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
started winning to move on every belt

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.590 
started winning to move on every belt
right<00:02:07.010> now<00:02:07.190> this<00:02:07.460> is<00:02:07.640> how<00:02:07.820> you're<00:02:08.000> trying<00:02:08.270> to

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
right now this is how you're trying to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.140 
right now this is how you're trying to
actually<00:02:08.780> get<00:02:09.530> clean<00:02:09.979> instep<00:02:10.550> in<00:02:10.729> a<00:02:10.790> different

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
actually get clean instep in a different

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:22.210 
actually get clean instep in a different
direction<00:02:11.240> so<00:02:20.200> I<00:02:21.200> just<00:02:21.500> want<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.830> show<00:02:22.160> you

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
direction so I just want to show you

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.420 
direction so I just want to show you
what<00:02:22.970> still<00:02:23.690> the<00:02:24.020> concept<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.650> all<00:02:24.920> of<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:25.220> is

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
what still the concept is all of this is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:28.450 
what still the concept is all of this is
around<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.970> world<00:02:26.030> the<00:02:26.870> most<00:02:27.200> basic<00:02:27.890> unfilled

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460 
around the world the most basic unfilled

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.220 
around the world the most basic unfilled
so<00:02:28.850> I'm<00:02:29.000> not<00:02:29.120> going<00:02:29.300> to<00:02:29.390> keep<00:02:29.540> saying<00:02:29.840> around

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
so I'm not going to keep saying around

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.110 
so I'm not going to keep saying around
the<00:02:30.560> world<00:02:30.830> anymore<00:02:31.490> because<00:02:31.670> we<00:02:31.970> know

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
the world anymore because we know

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.480 
the world anymore because we know
everything<00:02:32.990> is<00:02:33.350> going<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.590> happen<00:02:33.770> around<00:02:34.070> the

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
everything is going to happen around the

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.090 
everything is going to happen around the
world<00:02:34.700> but<00:02:35.330> the<00:02:35.510> importance<00:02:36.410> of<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.980> is

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:37.100 
world but the importance of it is

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.610 
world but the importance of it is
knowing<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.850> I'm<00:02:38.180> learning<00:02:38.510> too<00:02:38.930> stiff<00:02:39.410> or

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
knowing that I'm learning too stiff or

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.600 
knowing that I'm learning too stiff or
move<00:02:40.070> my<00:02:40.100> body<00:02:40.760> around<00:02:41.540> myself<00:02:41.810> and<00:02:42.440> then<00:02:43.430> we

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
move my body around myself and then we

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.699 
move my body around myself and then we
talked<00:02:43.880> about<00:02:44.030> from<00:02:44.450> nerve<00:02:44.720> gradually<00:02:45.410> we<00:02:45.530> get

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
talked about from nerve gradually we get

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.010 
talked about from nerve gradually we get
into<00:02:45.980> what's<00:02:46.250> naturally<00:02:46.820> happening<00:02:47.300> stepping

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:48.020 
into what's naturally happening stepping

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.260 
into what's naturally happening stepping
in<00:02:48.140> direction<00:02:48.860> and<00:02:49.010> angles<00:02:49.490> which<00:02:49.910> is<00:02:50.090> what

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
in direction and angles which is what

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.420 
in direction and angles which is what
the<00:02:50.450> system<00:02:51.170> of<00:02:51.350> else<00:02:51.590> tipping<00:02:52.010> is<00:02:52.130> about

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:52.430 
the system of else tipping is about

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.000 
the system of else tipping is about
there's<00:02:53.000> a<00:02:53.060> lot<00:02:53.209> more<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> L<00:02:54.440> step<00:02:54.830> I

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
there's a lot more to the L step I

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.670 
there's a lot more to the L step I
showed<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.760> most<00:02:56.030> basic<00:02:56.540> L<00:02:57.020> stuff

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
showed you a most basic L stuff

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.820 
showed you a most basic L stuff
learning<00:02:58.190> how<00:02:58.370> to<00:02:58.400> step<00:02:58.970> in<00:02:59.330> aids<00:02:59.959> in<00:03:00.230> simple

learning how to step in aids in simple
directions<00:03:01.400> I<00:03:01.790> want<00:03:02.360> you<00:03:02.540> to<00:03:02.690> also<00:03:02.989> add<00:03:03.440> this

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:03.830 
directions I want you to also add this

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:06.070 
directions I want you to also add this
in<00:03:04.130> right<00:03:04.790> now<00:03:05.030> we're<00:03:05.330> stepping<00:03:05.570> what<00:03:05.959> we

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
in right now we're stepping what we

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.130 
in right now we're stepping what we
called<00:03:06.380> zero<00:03:06.920> degrees<00:03:07.400> because<00:03:08.180> simply<00:03:08.780> place

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
called zero degrees because simply place

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.979 
called zero degrees because simply place
aren't<00:03:09.680> we're<00:03:10.040> not<00:03:10.280> stepping<00:03:10.640> past<00:03:11.330> the<00:03:11.690> foot

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
aren't we're not stepping past the foot

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.710 
aren't we're not stepping past the foot
I'm<00:03:12.800> stepping<00:03:13.220> at<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.459> distance<00:03:14.000> of<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.360> foot

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
I'm stepping at the distance of my foot

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.500 
I'm stepping at the distance of my foot
alright<00:03:15.590> so<00:03:16.070> that<00:03:16.100> is<00:03:16.400> thinking<00:03:16.940> I'm<00:03:17.060> still<00:03:17.209> at

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510 
alright so that is thinking I'm still at

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.979 
alright so that is thinking I'm still at
zero<00:03:17.870> degrees<00:03:18.320> or<00:03:18.530> you<00:03:19.489> can<00:03:19.640> think<00:03:19.850> level<00:03:20.660> one

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989 
zero degrees or you can think level one

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.500 
zero degrees or you can think level one
I<00:03:21.260> mean<00:03:21.590> love<00:03:21.769> your<00:03:21.920> zero<00:03:22.310> so<00:03:22.760> the<00:03:22.970> next<00:03:23.239> thing

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
I mean love your zero so the next thing

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.289 
I mean love your zero so the next thing
will<00:03:23.660> be<00:03:23.780> stepping<00:03:24.110> out<00:03:24.410> past<00:03:25.160> the<00:03:25.489> foot<00:03:25.730> just

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
will be stepping out past the foot just

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.150 
will be stepping out past the foot just
the<00:03:26.420> dissed<00:03:26.750> words<00:03:27.019> like<00:03:27.320> shoulder-width

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.160 
the dissed words like shoulder-width

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:31.870 
the dissed words like shoulder-width
apart<00:03:28.390> this<00:03:29.390> is<00:03:29.720> literally<00:03:30.170> number<00:03:30.890> one<00:03:31.130> from

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
apart this is literally number one from

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.970 
apart this is literally number one from
there<00:03:32.120> we<00:03:32.330> will<00:03:32.420> go<00:03:32.600> move<00:03:32.959> it<00:03:33.110> outside<00:03:33.320> of

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
there we will go move it outside of

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.699 
there we will go move it outside of
shoulder<00:03:34.160> width<00:03:34.489> which<00:03:34.700> is<00:03:34.730> level<00:03:35.090> two

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:35.709 
shoulder width which is level two

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.090 
shoulder width which is level two
important<00:03:36.709> thing

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
important thing

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.190 
important thing
level<00:03:37.430> two<00:03:37.640> is<00:03:37.670> outside<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.660> shoulder<00:03:38.840> width

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
level two is outside of shoulder width

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.580 
level two is outside of shoulder width
but<00:03:39.680> level<00:03:40.010> two<00:03:40.459> does<00:03:41.390> not<00:03:41.660> end<00:03:42.080> until<00:03:42.230> we

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
but level two does not end until we

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.190 
but level two does not end until we
begin<00:03:43.010> to<00:03:43.070> have<00:03:43.430> to<00:03:43.640> counterbalance<00:03:44.269> the<00:03:44.900> body

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:45.200 
begin to have to counterbalance the body

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:47.890 
begin to have to counterbalance the body
for<00:03:45.890> sniffing<00:03:46.310> did<00:03:46.880> everything<00:03:47.420> after<00:03:47.870> that

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
for sniffing did everything after that

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:50.009 
for sniffing did everything after that
is<00:03:48.170> level<00:03:48.410> three<00:03:48.830> so<00:03:49.280> again<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.790> have

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
is level three so again you have

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.539 
is level three so again you have
stepping<00:03:51.019> in<00:03:51.170> level<00:03:51.500> zero<00:03:51.920> which<00:03:52.370> is

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:52.549 
stepping in level zero which is

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:54.910 
stepping in level zero which is
literally<00:03:53.120> just<00:03:53.239> dipping<00:03:53.810> right<00:03:54.019> inside<00:03:54.680> them

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
literally just dipping right inside them

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.670 
literally just dipping right inside them
think<00:03:55.489> of<00:03:55.610> like<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.209> fleet<00:03:56.600> no<00:03:57.200> farther<00:03:57.560> than

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
think of like the fleet no farther than

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.970 
think of like the fleet no farther than
what<00:03:57.950> your<00:03:58.130> foot<00:03:58.370> naturally<00:03:58.580> were<00:03:59.000> go<00:03:59.680> as<00:04:00.680> far

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:00.980 
what your foot naturally were go as far

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.590 
what your foot naturally were go as far
as<00:04:01.100> naturally<00:04:01.519> being<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.820> size<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.299> your<00:04:02.390> foot

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
as naturally being the size of your foot

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.300 
as naturally being the size of your foot
some<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.870> you<00:04:02.959> guys<00:04:03.080> have<00:04:03.320> bigger<00:04:03.530> feet<00:04:03.799> on

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
some of you guys have bigger feet on

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:07.659 
some of you guys have bigger feet on
size<00:04:04.730> 14<00:04:05.360> and<00:04:05.450> 15<00:04:05.810> my<00:04:06.110> house<00:04:06.320> a<00:04:06.620> larger<00:04:07.220> 0.o

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:07.669 
size 14 and 15 my house a larger 0.o

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:10.530 
size 14 and 15 my house a larger 0.o
expanding<00:04:08.389> but<00:04:08.900> then<00:04:09.049> one<00:04:09.380> is<00:04:09.590> when<00:04:09.769> I<00:04:09.799> begin

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:10.540 
expanding but then one is when I begin

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.559 
expanding but then one is when I begin
outside<00:04:11.280> still<00:04:12.280> with<00:04:12.459> your<00:04:12.580> shoulder<00:04:13.120> work<00:04:13.269> so

00:04:13.559 --> 00:04:13.569 
outside still with your shoulder work so

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:15.750 
outside still with your shoulder work so
right<00:04:13.810> here<00:04:14.049> you<00:04:14.560> know<00:04:14.709> this<00:04:15.099> your<00:04:15.459> feet<00:04:15.730> are

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:15.760 
right here you know this your feet are

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.449 
right here you know this your feet are
naturally<00:04:16.389> semestre<00:04:16.989> symmetrically<00:04:17.919> inside

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
naturally semestre symmetrically inside

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.370 
naturally semestre symmetrically inside
of<00:04:18.639> your<00:04:18.760> shoulder<00:04:19.209> okay<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.989> I'm<00:04:20.079> stepping

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
of your shoulder okay so I'm stepping

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.650 
of your shoulder okay so I'm stepping
right<00:04:20.829> there<00:04:21.100> stepping<00:04:21.820> inside<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.540> my

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
right there stepping inside of my

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.740 
right there stepping inside of my
shoulder<00:04:23.139> room<00:04:23.490> level<00:04:24.490> two<00:04:24.880> when<00:04:25.300> I<00:04:25.330> begin<00:04:25.690> to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
shoulder room level two when I begin to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.400 
shoulder room level two when I begin to
step<00:04:26.139> outside<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.979> shoulder<00:04:27.340> there<00:04:27.520> and<00:04:28.410> the

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:29.410 
step outside and shoulder there and the

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:30.960 
step outside and shoulder there and the
reason<00:04:29.770> why<00:04:29.889> these<00:04:29.949> are<00:04:30.100> gradually<00:04:30.669> levels

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
reason why these are gradually levels

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:33.120 
reason why these are gradually levels
because<00:04:31.270> they<00:04:31.389> require<00:04:31.780> a<00:04:31.810> gradual<00:04:32.650> amount<00:04:32.919> of

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
because they require a gradual amount of

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.610 
because they require a gradual amount of
a<00:04:33.340> little<00:04:33.850> more<00:04:34.000> control<00:04:34.479> of<00:04:34.539> your<00:04:34.810> Center<00:04:35.289> as

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
a little more control of your Center as

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.860 
a little more control of your Center as
you<00:04:35.830> begin<00:04:36.070> to<00:04:36.280> move<00:04:36.430> your<00:04:36.970> body<00:04:37.150> farther<00:04:37.630> out

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
you begin to move your body farther out

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.590 
you begin to move your body farther out
from<00:04:37.900> your<00:04:38.380> Center<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.400> left<00:04:39.699> final<00:04:40.000> deep<00:04:40.449> I

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
from your Center then left final deep I

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.120 
from your Center then left final deep I
was<00:04:40.780> number<00:04:40.960> three<00:04:41.260> is<00:04:41.320> when<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.530> begin<00:04:41.830> to<00:04:41.889> have

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
was number three is when I begin to have

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:45.450 
was number three is when I begin to have
to<00:04:42.250> counterbalance<00:04:42.639> my<00:04:43.090> body<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.840> still<00:04:44.460> that

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
to counterbalance my body to still that

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.189 
to counterbalance my body to still that
is<00:04:45.610> what<00:04:45.760> I'm<00:04:45.970> doing<00:04:46.210> even<00:04:46.510> when<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.930> find

00:04:47.189 --> 00:04:47.199 
is what I'm doing even when you find

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:48.930 
is what I'm doing even when you find
yourself<00:04:47.440> having<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.430> counterbalance

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:48.940 
yourself having to counterbalance

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:52.110 
yourself having to counterbalance
against<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:49.870> stuff<00:04:50.110> alright<00:04:50.979> so<00:04:51.580> you<00:04:52.090> can

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
against the stuff alright so you can

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.930 
against the stuff alright so you can
practice<00:04:52.630> that<00:04:53.350> basic<00:04:54.010> bounce<00:04:54.280> on<00:04:54.610> our<00:04:54.760> gave

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
practice that basic bounce on our gave

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:55.379 
practice that basic bounce on our gave
you

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389 
you

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:57.990 
you
you<00:04:55.690> can<00:04:55.870> practice<00:04:56.350> simply<00:04:57.190> doing<00:04:57.460> it<00:04:57.850> and

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 
you can practice simply doing it and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.840 
you can practice simply doing it and
using<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.900> around<00:04:59.350> the<00:04:59.560> world<00:04:59.699> which<00:05:00.699> is
