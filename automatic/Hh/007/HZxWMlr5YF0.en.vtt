00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
controller that's a mini computer when I

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.400 
controller that's a mini computer when I
turn<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.430> crown<00:00:35.760> pushed<00:00:36.690> across<00:00:36.840> four

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
turn the crown pushed across four

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
turn the crown pushed across four
seconds<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.040> going<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.250> turn<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.550> watch<00:00:38.969> off

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
seconds it's going to turn the watch off

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.510 
seconds it's going to turn the watch off
and<00:00:40.170> it's<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.440> gonna<00:00:40.620> be<00:00:40.739> telling<00:00:41.070> time<00:00:41.250> but

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
and it's so gonna be telling time but

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.979 
and it's so gonna be telling time but
it's<00:00:41.610> no<00:00:41.760> longer<00:00:41.850> gonna<00:00:42.120> indicate<00:00:42.450> the<00:00:42.719> time

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
it's no longer gonna indicate the time

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.170 
it's no longer gonna indicate the time
and<00:00:43.379> what<00:00:44.160> it's<00:00:44.280> doing<00:00:44.399> right<00:00:44.640> now<00:00:44.700> is<00:00:45.030> its

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
and what it's doing right now is its

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.360 
and what it's doing right now is its
setting<00:00:45.510> all<00:00:45.629> those<00:00:45.750> belts<00:00:46.140> around<00:00:46.370> finding

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
setting all those belts around finding

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.610 
setting all those belts around finding
out<00:00:47.460> where<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:47.820> are<00:00:47.850> sending<00:00:48.809> them<00:00:48.960> home<00:00:49.230> to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
out where they are sending them home to

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.540 
out where they are sending them home to
1200<00:00:50.360> and<00:00:51.360> it's<00:00:52.140> timekeeping<00:00:52.710> function<00:00:53.190> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
1200 and it's timekeeping function and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.610 
1200 and it's timekeeping function and
then<00:00:53.789> right<00:00:54.090> here<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.629> second<00:00:55.050> belt<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.590> a

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
then right here the second belt is a

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.220 
then right here the second belt is a
hidden<00:00:55.920> power<00:00:56.190> reserve<00:00:56.579> meter<00:00:56.850> it<00:00:57.300> stops<00:00:57.750> at

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
hidden power reserve meter it stops at

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
hidden power reserve meter it stops at
five<00:00:58.590> which<00:00:58.920> indicates<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.460> have<00:00:59.579> 50%<00:00:59.879> power

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
five which indicates you have 50% power

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.270 
five which indicates you have 50% power
reserve<00:01:00.780> left<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.469> everything<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.070> see

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
reserve left and everything that you see

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.910 
reserve left and everything that you see
here<00:01:02.520> is<00:01:02.609> mechanical<00:01:03.439> but<00:01:04.439> instead<00:01:04.799> of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
here is mechanical but instead of

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.770 
here is mechanical but instead of
storing<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.400> energy<00:01:05.820> in<00:01:05.970> a<00:01:06.030> mainspring<00:01:06.570> we

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
storing the energy in a mainspring we

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.289 
storing the energy in a mainspring we
store<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.680> battery<00:01:07.740> and<00:01:08.460> the<00:01:08.880> reason<00:01:09.180> is

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
store it in a battery and the reason is

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.940 
store it in a battery and the reason is
if<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:09.720> had<00:01:09.869> made<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.350> purely<00:01:10.799> mechanical

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
if we had made it a purely mechanical

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.399 
if we had made it a purely mechanical
watch<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:12.180> would<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> been<00:01:12.659> probably<00:01:13.140> three

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
watch it would have been probably three

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.359 
watch it would have been probably three
to<00:01:13.500> four<00:01:13.650> hundred<00:01:13.770> thousand<00:01:14.310> dollars<00:01:14.610> and<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:16.359 --> 00:01:16.369 
to four hundred thousand dollars and the

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.770 
to four hundred thousand dollars and the
power<00:01:17.369> reserve<00:01:17.790> would<00:01:18.000> be<00:01:18.119> very<00:01:18.390> very<00:01:18.689> small

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
power reserve would be very very small

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.289 
power reserve would be very very small
so<00:01:19.619> we<00:01:19.650> used<00:01:20.460> a<00:01:20.580> battery<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.210> the<00:01:21.240> power

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
so we used a battery and the power

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.810 
so we used a battery and the power
reserve<00:01:21.840> is<00:01:22.140> actually<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.530> to<00:01:22.650> 14<00:01:23.070> days<00:01:23.100> when

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
reserve is actually up to 14 days when

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.910 
reserve is actually up to 14 days when
we<00:01:23.939> first<00:01:24.240> developed<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.810> watch<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.409> came<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
we first developed this watch we came to

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.920 
we first developed this watch we came to
Switzerland<00:01:26.280> and<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:27.000> tried<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.299> develop<00:01:27.630> it

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
Switzerland and we tried to develop it

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.649 
Switzerland and we tried to develop it
with<00:01:28.110> Swiss<00:01:28.470> suppliers<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.850> those<00:01:30.450> same

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
with Swiss suppliers and those same

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.450 
with Swiss suppliers and those same
suppliers<00:01:31.079> all<00:01:31.409> they<00:01:31.530> saw<00:01:31.770> was<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.009> rendering

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
suppliers all they saw was a rendering

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.370 
suppliers all they saw was a rendering
that<00:01:32.640> looked<00:01:32.790> like<00:01:32.880> this<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.720> they<00:01:34.020> said<00:01:34.229> no

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
that looked like this and they said no

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.380 
that looked like this and they said no
that's<00:01:34.530> impossible<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.310> can't<00:01:35.670> do<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
that's impossible you can't do that it

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.539 
that's impossible you can't do that it
will<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.750> fit<00:01:37.229> in<00:01:37.409> a<00:01:37.560> case<00:01:37.799> that<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.159> on<00:01:38.400> your

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
will not fit in a case that will on your

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.490 
will not fit in a case that will on your
wrist<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:39.000> that's<00:01:39.479> why<00:01:39.750> we've<00:01:39.930> developed<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
wrist and that's why we've developed and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.649 
wrist and that's why we've developed and
designed<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.920> watch<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.460> are<00:01:41.909> manufacturing

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
designed the watch and are manufacturing

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.569 
designed the watch and are manufacturing
it<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.899> California<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.619> we<00:01:43.829> have

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
it to California because we have

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:47.120 
it to California because we have
suppliers<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.840> partners<00:01:45.899> in<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.860> aerospace
