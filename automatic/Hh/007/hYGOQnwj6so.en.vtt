general<00:00:13.110> efficiency<00:00:13.710> with<00:00:13.860> space<00:00:14.269> but<00:00:15.269> as<00:00:15.450> a

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
general efficiency with space but as a

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.660 
general efficiency with space but as a
Windows<00:00:15.870> 7<00:00:16.320> user<00:00:16.560> if<00:00:16.890> there's<00:00:17.100> one<00:00:17.340> thing<00:00:17.609> that

in<00:00:26.910> Photoshop<00:00:27.720> cs5<00:00:28.730> it<00:00:29.730> looks<00:00:30.029> something<00:00:30.269> like

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
in Photoshop cs5 it looks something like

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.630 
in Photoshop cs5 it looks something like
this

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:41.569 

if<00:00:36.050> you<00:00:37.050> selected<00:00:37.710> a<00:00:37.829> raw<00:00:38.040> image<00:00:39.800> then<00:00:40.800> you'd

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
if you selected a raw image then you'd

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.610 
if you selected a raw image then you'd
get<00:00:41.760> a<00:00:41.820> nice<00:00:42.059> little<00:00:42.360> preview<00:00:42.899> down<00:00:43.350> at<00:00:43.500> the

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
get a nice little preview down at the

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.799 
get a nice little preview down at the
bottom<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.100> window<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.760> course<00:00:44.850> the

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
bottom of the window and of course the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.840 
bottom of the window and of course the
same<00:00:45.989> thing<00:00:46.020> would<00:00:46.469> happen<00:00:46.649> if<00:00:47.070> you<00:00:47.309> selected

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
same thing would happen if you selected

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.229 
same thing would happen if you selected
a<00:00:48.120> PSD<00:00:48.570> file<00:00:49.070> you<00:00:50.070> get<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> little<00:00:50.579> image

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
a PSD file you get a little image

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.700 
a PSD file you get a little image
preview<00:00:52.160> but<00:00:53.160> take<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> look<00:00:53.640> at<00:00:53.789> cs6<00:00:54.680> when<00:00:55.680> I

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
preview but take a look at cs6 when I

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.729 
preview but take a look at cs6 when I
open<00:00:56.280> a<00:00:56.340> folder<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.879> RAW<00:00:57.120> images<00:00:57.350> from<00:00:58.350> the

file open menu this is when I get a

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.039 
file open menu this is when I get a
bunch<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.899> generic<00:01:04.650> icons<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:06.270> if<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.600> click<00:01:06.900> on

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
bunch of generic icons and if I click on

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.359 
bunch of generic icons and if I click on
one<00:01:07.850> the<00:01:08.850> preview<00:01:09.420> window<00:01:09.659> is<00:01:10.140> gone<00:01:10.439> if<00:01:11.130> I

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
one the preview window is gone if I

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.940 
one the preview window is gone if I
wanted<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.700> select<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.479> particular<00:01:13.290> image<00:01:13.710> out

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
wanted to select a particular image out

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.700 
wanted to select a particular image out
of<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:14.250> folder<00:01:14.729> I'd<00:01:15.720> pretty<00:01:16.020> much<00:01:16.110> have<00:01:16.530> to

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
of this folder I'd pretty much have to

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.280 
of this folder I'd pretty much have to
have<00:01:16.830> memorized<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:18.030> file<00:01:18.570> numbers<00:01:18.990> and

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
have memorized the file numbers and

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.700 
have memorized the file numbers and
that's<00:01:19.640> not<00:01:20.640> very<00:01:20.909> helpful<00:01:21.180> now<00:01:21.990> I'm<00:01:22.229> sure

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
that's not very helpful now I'm sure

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
that's not very helpful now I'm sure
that<00:01:22.740> our<00:01:23.310> friends<00:01:23.759> at<00:01:23.850> Adobe<00:01:24.299> did<00:01:24.570> this<00:01:24.840> with

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
that our friends at Adobe did this with

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.810 
that our friends at Adobe did this with
the<00:01:25.409> assumption<00:01:25.920> that<00:01:25.950> if<00:01:26.280> we<00:01:26.460> needed<00:01:26.700> to

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
the assumption that if we needed to

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.149 
the assumption that if we needed to
browse<00:01:27.180> through<00:01:27.210> images<00:01:29.570> we'd<00:01:30.570> use<00:01:30.930> bridge<00:01:31.710> or

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
browse through images we'd use bridge or

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.510 
browse through images we'd use bridge or
mini<00:01:32.820> bridge<00:01:33.180> but<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.960> fact<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.490> there<00:01:35.490> are

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
mini bridge but the fact is there are

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.030 
mini bridge but the fact is there are
some<00:01:36.180> times<00:01:36.479> when<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.079> faster<00:01:37.799> and<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
some times when it's just faster and it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:41.149 
some times when it's just faster and it
makes<00:01:38.220> more<00:01:38.400> sense<00:01:38.460> to<00:01:39.060> quickly<00:01:39.869> use<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.290> open

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
makes more sense to quickly use the open

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.469 
makes more sense to quickly use the open
dialog<00:01:42.799> for<00:01:43.799> Mac<00:01:43.979> users<00:01:44.490> this<00:01:45.119> isn't<00:01:45.420> a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
dialog for Mac users this isn't a

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.420 
dialog for Mac users this isn't a
problem<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:46.259> operating<00:01:46.740> system<00:01:47.130> can

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
problem the operating system can

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
problem the operating system can
generate<00:01:47.850> thumbnail<00:01:48.390> images<00:01:48.840> from<00:01:49.020> RAW<00:01:49.200> files

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
generate thumbnail images from RAW files

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.330 
generate thumbnail images from RAW files
so<00:01:50.430> they<00:01:50.640> don't<00:01:50.820> need<00:01:51.180> a<00:01:51.240> preview<00:01:51.720> window<00:01:52.340> so

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
so they don't need a preview window so

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.929 
so they don't need a preview window so
what<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.210> Windows<00:01:54.659> users<00:01:55.049> do<00:01:55.369> well<00:01:56.369> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
what can Windows users do well the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.390 
what can Windows users do well the
solution<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.450> actually<00:01:57.600> pretty<00:01:58.020> simple

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
solution is actually pretty simple

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.180 
solution is actually pretty simple

Photoshop just a little bit easier and
of<00:04:53.570> course<00:04:54.099> it<00:04:55.099> will<00:04:55.280> do<00:04:55.460> the<00:04:55.639> same<00:04:55.849> thing

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
of course it will do the same thing
