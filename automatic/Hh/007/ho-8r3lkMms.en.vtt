00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.720
 hello everyone good as I said he 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.370
 follows the evaluation criteria of 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.980
 the courts for the oppositions of 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.780
 English, good to tell you that the subject is 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.119
 to take into account style to the primary 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.849
 the organization is worth the structure 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.800
 clarity the aquitaine introduction that 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.029
 have conclusion that the 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.829
 complete topic and that you have a 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.070
 grammatical and orthographic correction 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:30.750
 In addition to the coherence between the theme 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.690
 also establish coherence and 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.860
 establish a let's say with links between a 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:39.690
 and another and interrelate section of 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.790
 interrelation of concepts of form 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.590
 coherent then put into practice the 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.420
 imagined practice of practical assumption 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.180
 so that there is a bibliography 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.320
 that there is legislation that is 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.110
 sahagÃºn didactic development and 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.530
 curricular that has aspects 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:57.630
 organizational and applied to your position 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.720
 that is offered and especially a 

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.910
 educational structure very similar to 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.470
 of primary programming puts that is 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.360
 what is included in the call does not 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.640
 they put to the sea so I do not say the same 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.009
 the good didactic unit that has a 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.590
 contextualization the type of center the 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.240
 type of students we have and so on 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.460
 formulate a correct formulation and 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.070
 relation of the objectives in relation to 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.340
 the contents and the criteria of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:26.040
 valuation also that they have to be formed 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.450
 also the basic skills and a 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.160
 methodology say that we talk about 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.710
 methodological judgments that we consider 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.510
 our five 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.210
 cater to different styles of 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.170
 learning and above all that to those 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.280
 motivating and active activities 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.810
 after the activities also good 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.869
 because they are meant to arrive 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.110
 to the objectives that are all adapted 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.750
 to the students and to the level they have and 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.250
 use of varied resources worth 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.960
 and finally the demographic criteria 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:56.450
 as I said that they be consistent 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.770
 with the objectives with the contents with 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:00.080
 the activities and with the competences 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.000
 basic that are varied that are 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:06.830
 flexible and adapted to the 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.600
 students that of English and nothing more than 20 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:12.110
 is recording another video if it can be 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:15.040
 at least it depends or music is worth and 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:18.040
 If I have light, I'm still staying in 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.040
 castropol
