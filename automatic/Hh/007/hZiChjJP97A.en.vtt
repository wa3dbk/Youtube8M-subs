actually a relatively new addition to
Android<00:04:59.640> and<00:04:59.910> basically<00:05:00.300> the<00:05:00.510> two<00:05:00.690> users<00:05:01.110> with

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
Android and basically the two users with

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.590

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
Android phones that have near field

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.200 
Android phones that have near field

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
communication or NFC would hold them up

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.150 
communication or NFC would hold them up
to<00:05:06.360> each<00:05:06.510> other<00:05:06.720> and<00:05:06.930> they<00:05:07.440> could<00:05:07.620> transfer

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160

a car but it's the pinnacle of car
technology<00:05:24.450> so<00:05:25.050> it's<00:05:25.169> practically<00:05:25.530> the<00:05:25.710> only

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
technology so it's practically the only

for<00:05:41.130> a<00:05:41.160> fully<00:05:41.520> electric<00:05:42.060> car<00:05:42.270> like<00:05:42.660> I<00:05:42.690> said

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
for a fully electric car like I said

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:44.810 
for a fully electric car like I said
it's<00:05:43.110> basically<00:05:43.410> the<00:05:43.590> only<00:05:43.770> fully<00:05:44.250> electric

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:44.820 
it's basically the only fully electric

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.060 
it's basically the only fully electric
sports<00:05:45.120> car<00:05:45.330> and<00:05:45.600> it<00:05:46.080> comes<00:05:46.410> equipped<00:05:46.710> with<00:05:46.950> a

console<00:05:50.010> that<00:05:50.310> can<00:05:50.490> do<00:05:50.580> basically<00:05:50.850> everything

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
console that can do basically everything

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:52.790 
console that can do basically everything
from<00:05:51.479> controlling<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:52.020> headlights<00:05:52.440> to<00:05:52.710> the

out they plan on releasing an iphone
application<00:05:56.970> and<00:05:57.210> I'm<00:05:57.360> assuming<00:05:57.780> an

00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:57.900 
application and I'm assuming an

00:05:57.900 --> 00:05:59.900 
application and I'm assuming an
application<00:05:58.440> for<00:05:58.590> Android<00:05:59.040> as<00:05:59.220> well<00:05:59.250> that

00:05:59.900 --> 00:05:59.910 
application for Android as well that

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:01.880 
application for Android as well that
will<00:06:00.060> allow<00:06:00.270> users<00:06:00.660> to<00:06:00.870> track<00:06:01.410> their<00:06:01.680> car

will allow users to track their car

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:03.469 
will allow users to track their car
wherever<00:06:02.130> it<00:06:02.460> is<00:06:02.580> so<00:06:03.000> you<00:06:03.090> can<00:06:03.300> always

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
wherever it is so you can always

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:05.510 
wherever it is so you can always
remember<00:06:03.870> where<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.410> park<00:06:04.710> and<00:06:04.860> actually

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:05.520 
remember where you park and actually

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:07.940 
remember where you park and actually
change<00:06:05.970> the<00:06:06.090> climate<00:06:06.540> inside<00:06:07.410> of<00:06:07.620> the<00:06:07.710> car

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
change the climate inside of the car

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:10.340 
change the climate inside of the car
before<00:06:08.460> you<00:06:08.940> get<00:06:09.210> to<00:06:09.390> it<00:06:09.540> so<00:06:09.810> it's<00:06:09.990> set<00:06:10.140> to<00:06:10.169> the

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
before you get to it so it's set to the

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:11.900 
before you get to it so it's set to the
temperature<00:06:10.740> you<00:06:10.890> want<00:06:11.070> before<00:06:11.280> you<00:06:11.640> start

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
temperature you want before you start

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.840 
temperature you want before you start
driving<00:06:12.210> and<00:06:12.650> finally<00:06:13.650> we<00:06:13.919> have<00:06:14.100> the<00:06:14.130> lytro

00:06:14.840 --> 00:06:14.850 
driving and finally we have the lytro

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:16.580 
driving and finally we have the lytro
camera<00:06:15.360> which<00:06:15.720> is<00:06:15.900> a<00:06:15.930> super<00:06:16.350> small

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:16.590 
camera which is a super small

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:19.070 
camera which is a super small
odd-looking<00:06:17.060> camera<00:06:18.060> that<00:06:18.419> offers<00:06:18.750> a<00:06:18.780> new

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:19.080 
odd-looking camera that offers a new

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:20.930 
odd-looking camera that offers a new
type<00:06:19.320> of<00:06:19.350> technology<00:06:20.130> that<00:06:20.160> allows<00:06:20.610> you<00:06:20.850> to

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:20.940 
type of technology that allows you to

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.630 
type of technology that allows you to
actually<00:06:21.120> take<00:06:21.690> pictures<00:06:22.229> and<00:06:22.400> refocus<00:06:23.400> them

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:23.640 
actually take pictures and refocus them

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:25.400 
actually take pictures and refocus them
at<00:06:23.820> a<00:06:23.850> later<00:06:23.970> point<00:06:24.510> in<00:06:24.660> time<00:06:24.720> and<00:06:25.290> they're

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:25.410 
at a later point in time and they're

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:26.480 
at a later point in time and they're
actually<00:06:25.500> calling<00:06:25.860> them<00:06:26.010> living<00:06:26.190> pictures

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:26.490 
actually calling them living pictures

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:28.280 
actually calling them living pictures
because<00:06:26.880> you<00:06:27.090> can<00:06:27.270> change<00:06:27.510> the<00:06:27.720> focus<00:06:28.020> of<00:06:28.140> them

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
because you can change the focus of them

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.170 
because you can change the focus of them
anytime<00:06:28.680> you<00:06:29.040> want<00:06:29.280> so<00:06:29.640> that's<00:06:29.790> it<00:06:29.910> for<00:06:29.940> this

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
anytime you want so that's it for this

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:31.940 
anytime you want so that's it for this
video<00:06:30.390> and<00:06:30.570> I<00:06:30.780> hope<00:06:30.810> I<00:06:31.020> did<00:06:31.169> cover<00:06:31.380> most<00:06:31.680> of<00:06:31.830> the
