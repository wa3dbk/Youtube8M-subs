too<00:01:49.870> early<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.100> told<00:01:51.370> him<00:01:51.550> okay<00:01:52.060> try<00:01:52.270> to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:52.300 
too early so I told him okay try to

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.810 
too early so I told him okay try to
avoid<00:01:52.710> after<00:01:53.710> you<00:01:53.800> hear<00:01:53.980> that<00:01:54.100> warning<00:01:54.490> and<00:01:54.700> he

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:54.820 
avoid after you hear that warning and he

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.640 
avoid after you hear that warning and he
did<00:01:55.150> excellent<00:01:55.930> steering<00:01:56.110> maneuver<00:01:56.350> very
