00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
alright guys it's Friday Friday I got up

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.280 
alright guys it's Friday Friday I got up
I<00:00:06.629> did<00:00:06.779> my<00:00:06.870> little<00:00:07.049> test<00:00:07.259> drive<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:09.139> lot<00:00:10.139> an

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
I did my little test drive this a lot an

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.589 
I did my little test drive this a lot an
hour<00:00:10.410> ago<00:00:10.830> let's<00:00:11.130> put<00:00:11.280> it<00:00:11.340> that<00:00:11.400> way<00:00:11.519> time<00:00:12.450> is

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
hour ago let's put it that way time is

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.580 
hour ago let's put it that way time is
it<00:00:12.690> right<00:00:12.870> now<00:00:13.049> I<00:00:14.420> can<00:00:15.420> only<00:00:15.480> guess<00:00:15.870> 11<00:00:16.440> o'clock

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
it right now I can only guess 11 o'clock

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.370 
it right now I can only guess 11 o'clock
maybe<00:00:17.869> anyway<00:00:20.300> here's<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.510> results<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.230> on

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
maybe anyway here's the results I got on

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
maybe anyway here's the results I got on
my<00:00:22.500> 12<00:00:23.100> mile<00:00:23.430> loop<00:00:24.470> yesterday<00:00:25.470> I<00:00:25.500> got<00:00:25.880> 8.3

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
my 12 mile loop yesterday I got 8.3

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.040 
my 12 mile loop yesterday I got 8.3
miles<00:00:27.359> per<00:00:27.689> gallon<00:00:28.109> with<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.300> jet<00:00:30.300> throttle

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
miles per gallon with the jet throttle

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.670 
miles per gallon with the jet throttle
body<00:00:31.230> spacer<00:00:34.520> this<00:00:35.520> morning<00:00:36.320> with<00:00:37.320> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
body spacer this morning with the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.930 
body spacer this morning with the
throttle<00:00:38.100> body<00:00:38.250> removed<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.200> same<00:00:40.739> 12<00:00:41.370> and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
throttle body removed on the same 12 and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.580 
throttle body removed on the same 12 and
12<00:00:42.570> 27<00:00:43.230> mile<00:00:43.530> loop<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:44.329> only<00:00:45.329> got<00:00:45.570> eight<00:00:45.930> point

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
12 27 mile loop I only got eight point

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.630 
12 27 mile loop I only got eight point
nine<00:00:47.300> miles<00:00:48.300> per<00:00:48.450> gallon<00:00:48.960> so<00:00:49.430> that's<00:00:50.430> not<00:00:50.610> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
nine miles per gallon so that's not a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.459 
nine miles per gallon so that's not a
big<00:00:50.879> difference

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.900 

traffic<00:00:55.469> was<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> little<00:00:55.980> lighter<00:00:56.219> that<00:00:56.579> could

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
traffic was a little lighter that could

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.510 
traffic was a little lighter that could
probably<00:00:57.239> contribute<00:00:57.870> to<00:00:58.050> my<00:00:58.199> mileage<00:00:58.770> gain

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
probably contribute to my mileage gain

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.349 
probably contribute to my mileage gain
actually<00:00:59.969> gain<00:01:00.510> mileage<00:01:01.430> not<00:01:02.430> not<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> big<00:01:03.120> gain

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
actually gain mileage not not a big gain

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.190 
actually gain mileage not not a big gain
the<00:01:03.600> only<00:01:04.220> point<00:01:05.220> six<00:01:05.939> miles<00:01:06.510> per<00:01:06.720> gallon

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the only point six miles per gallon

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.520 
the only point six miles per gallon
better<00:01:10.070> anyways<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.479> did<00:01:12.479> get<00:01:12.720> a<00:01:13.020> mileage

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
better anyways I did get a mileage

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.780 
better anyways I did get a mileage
increase<00:01:15.770> without<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.220> throttle<00:01:17.580> body

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
increase without the throttle body

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.450 
increase without the throttle body
spacer<00:01:17.970> so<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.740> do<00:01:19.799> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:19.920> about<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
spacer so what do I think about the

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.480 
spacer so what do I think about the
throttle<00:01:20.790> body<00:01:20.939> spacer<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.570> far<00:01:22.250> well<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.369> I

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
throttle body spacer so far well like I

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:24.710 
throttle body spacer so far well like I
said<00:01:23.549> yesterday<00:01:23.880> it<00:01:24.240> makes<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.570> good

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
said yesterday it makes a good

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.030 
said yesterday it makes a good
paperweight<00:01:25.759> so<00:01:26.930> I'll<00:01:27.930> give<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.829> going<00:01:28.950> to

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
paperweight so I'll give a I'm going to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.670 
paperweight so I'll give a I'm going to
give<00:01:29.159> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.340> theory<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.909> throttles<00:01:30.680> I'm

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
give a little theory on throttles I'm

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.300 
give a little theory on throttles I'm
going<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.070> give<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.310> a<00:01:32.340> little<00:01:32.490> throttle<00:01:32.880> body

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
going to give you a little throttle body

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.350 
going to give you a little throttle body
theory<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.350> my<00:01:37.590> theory

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:40.360 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.030 

I'll<00:01:41.360> have<00:01:41.540> to<00:01:41.630> get<00:01:41.720> my<00:01:41.869> little<00:01:42.020> markers<00:01:42.860> out

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 
I'll have to get my little markers out

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.730 
I'll have to get my little markers out
and<00:01:43.869> demonstrate<00:01:45.430> all<00:01:46.430> right<00:01:47.350> I'm<00:01:48.350> going<00:01:48.680> to

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
and demonstrate all right I'm going to

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.070 
and demonstrate all right I'm going to
show<00:01:48.920> you<00:01:48.950> right<00:01:49.280> now<00:01:49.460> where<00:01:49.970> a<00:01:50.420> throttle<00:01:50.869> body

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
show you right now where a throttle body

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.429 
show you right now where a throttle body
spacer<00:01:51.170> would<00:01:51.860> work<00:01:53.140> theoretically<00:01:54.140> where

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
spacer would work theoretically where

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.719 
spacer would work theoretically where
hey<00:01:54.710> here's<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.979> draught<00:01:55.190> of<00:01:55.220> eyespace<00:01:57.580> this<00:01:58.580> is

00:01:58.719 --> 00:01:58.729 
hey here's a draught of eyespace this is

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.070 
hey here's a draught of eyespace this is
not<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.909> throttle<00:01:59.360> body<00:01:59.539> this<00:01:59.780> is<00:01:59.810> not<00:01:59.930> a

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
not a throttle body this is not a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.520 
not a throttle body this is not a
fuel-injected<00:02:00.680> engine<00:02:01.840> let's<00:02:02.840> just<00:02:03.110> say<00:02:03.320> this

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 
fuel-injected engine let's just say this

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.690 
fuel-injected engine let's just say this
is<00:02:03.740> an<00:02:03.890> engine<00:02:04.220> this<00:02:04.340> is<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.580> intake<00:02:05.390> carburetor

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
is an engine this is a intake carburetor

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.309 
is an engine this is a intake carburetor
and<00:02:07.700> take<00:02:10.150> all<00:02:11.150> right<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.480> hope<00:02:11.630> this<00:02:11.870> comes<00:02:12.050> out

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
and take all right I hope this comes out

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.420 
and take all right I hope this comes out
ok<00:02:12.680> see<00:02:13.370> me<00:02:13.519> in<00:02:13.610> there<00:02:14.890> you<00:02:15.890> in<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.130> back<00:02:16.280> of

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
ok see me in there you in the back of

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.050 
ok see me in there you in the back of
the<00:02:16.489> class<00:02:16.730> you<00:02:16.970> can't<00:02:17.209> see<00:02:17.420> too<00:02:17.660> good<00:02:19.060> all

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060

the class you can't see too good all
right<00:02:20.209> this<00:02:20.480> is<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.660> way<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:20.750> regular

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
right this is the way a regular

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.039 
right this is the way a regular
aspirated<00:02:22.549> engine<00:02:22.819> works<00:02:23.000> is<00:02:23.900> your

pitcher air goes in through the top of
the<00:02:30.560> carburetor<00:02:32.140> it<00:02:33.220> mixes<00:02:34.220> ours<00:02:34.730> at<00:02:35.480> an

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 
the carburetor it mixes ours at an

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.390 
the carburetor it mixes ours at an
atomized<00:02:36.580> atomized<00:02:38.680> with<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.830> fuel<00:02:40.100> who's

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
atomized atomized with the fuel who's

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.990 
atomized atomized with the fuel who's
your<00:02:40.580> few<00:02:40.819> here's<00:02:41.540> your<00:02:41.690> air<00:02:41.870> it<00:02:42.440> mix<00:02:42.830> is<00:02:43.190> comes

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
your few here's your air it mix is comes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.710 
your few here's your air it mix is comes
out<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> bottom<00:02:44.540> the<00:02:44.630> carburetor<00:02:45.430> ok<00:02:46.720> and

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
out the bottom the carburetor ok and

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.259 
out the bottom the carburetor ok and
then<00:02:48.910> goes<00:02:49.910> to<00:02:49.940> your<00:02:50.209> cylinders<00:02:52.269> actually

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
then goes to your cylinders actually

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.420 
then goes to your cylinders actually
goes<00:02:53.480> to<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.900> valve<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.590> cylinder<00:02:54.980> heads<00:02:55.250> and

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
goes to the valve the cylinder heads and

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.069 
goes to the valve the cylinder heads and
all<00:02:55.519> that<00:02:55.640> kind<00:02:55.880> of<00:02:55.970> stuff<00:02:56.239> this<00:02:56.690> is<00:02:56.810> all<00:02:56.930> we're

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
all that kind of stuff this is all we're

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.069 
all that kind of stuff this is all we're
concerned<00:02:57.410> about<00:02:57.530> right<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:58.100> so<00:02:58.900> I've<00:02:59.900> heard

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
concerned about right here so I've heard

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.720 
concerned about right here so I've heard
of<00:03:00.260> throttle<00:03:00.530> body<00:03:00.709> spacer<00:03:00.799> is<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.310> long<00:03:01.489> time

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730

mixing<00:03:18.049> together<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:19.370> want<00:03:19.579> to<00:03:19.760> mix<00:03:19.910> really

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:20.329 
mixing together you want to mix really

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:23.770 
mixing together you want to mix really
good<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.170> have<00:03:21.290> a<00:03:21.320> problem<00:03:21.650> body<00:03:21.950> spacer<00:03:22.780> ok

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
good you have a problem body spacer ok

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.920 
good you have a problem body spacer ok
ah<00:03:27.730> that's<00:03:28.730> pretty<00:03:29.150> much<00:03:29.299> where<00:03:29.510> throttle

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
ah that's pretty much where throttle

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.400 
ah that's pretty much where throttle
bodies<00:03:30.319> would<00:03:30.680> be<00:03:30.739> a<00:03:30.890> benefit<00:03:31.400> right<00:03:31.549> there

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
bodies would be a benefit right there

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:35.259 
bodies would be a benefit right there
dog<00:03:33.410> body<00:03:33.680> spacer<00:03:34.250> just<00:03:34.489> like<00:03:34.700> this<00:03:34.910> and<00:03:35.090> right

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
dog body spacer just like this and right

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.760 
dog body spacer just like this and right
here<00:03:36.310> yeah

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:42.770 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:45.980 

okay<00:03:43.770> this<00:03:44.010> is<00:03:44.130> just<00:03:44.310> another<00:03:44.670> example<00:03:44.990> this

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:45.990 
okay this is just another example this

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.720 
okay this is just another example this
is<00:03:46.050> on<00:03:46.350> a<00:03:46.380> fuel-injected<00:03:47.100> engine<00:03:47.520> okay

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
is on a fuel-injected engine okay

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.160 
is on a fuel-injected engine okay
there's<00:03:47.940> two<00:03:48.090> types<00:03:48.330> of<00:03:48.510> fuel<00:03:48.720> injection

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
there's two types of fuel injection

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.820 
there's two types of fuel injection
there's<00:03:49.440> throttle<00:03:49.860> body<00:03:50.070> injection<00:03:51.830> would

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:52.830 
there's throttle body injection would

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:54.350 
there's throttle body injection would
probably<00:03:53.190> work<00:03:53.340> right<00:03:53.640> here<00:03:53.880> on<00:03:54.060> throttle

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
probably work right here on throttle

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.260 
probably work right here on throttle
body<00:03:54.720> injection<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:56.280> most<00:03:56.520> engines<00:03:57.000> don't

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
body injection but most engines don't

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:58.880 
body injection but most engines don't
have<00:03:57.510> frontal<00:03:57.870> body<00:03:58.050> injuries<00:03:58.530> may<00:03:58.710> have

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
have frontal body injuries may have

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.150 
have frontal body injuries may have
injection<00:03:59.490> way<00:03:59.640> down<00:03:59.820> at<00:04:00.000> silvers<00:04:01.160> fuel

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
injection way down at silvers fuel

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.880 
injection way down at silvers fuel
injection<00:04:02.880> this<00:04:03.780> is<00:04:03.900> just<00:04:04.050> an<00:04:04.170> example<00:04:04.290> this

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
injection this is just an example this

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:19.390 
injection this is just an example this
isn't<00:04:07.100> exactly<00:04:09.140> this<00:04:10.140> is<00:04:10.350> not<00:04:10.770> perfect<00:04:11.580> but

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:23.320 

all<00:04:19.940> right<00:04:20.090> get<00:04:20.449> that<00:04:20.630> point<00:04:21.580> fueled<00:04:22.580> is

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
all right get that point fueled is

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:28.050 
all right get that point fueled is
delivered<00:04:23.870> way<00:04:23.990> down<00:04:24.290> at<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.860> cylinder<00:04:25.310> head

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.760 

this<00:04:29.060> air<00:04:31.900> comes<00:04:32.900> through<00:04:33.169> your<00:04:33.320> throttle

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
this air comes through your throttle

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:44.320 
this air comes through your throttle
body<00:04:34.600> this<00:04:35.600> is<00:04:35.810> your<00:04:35.960> throttle<00:04:36.199> body

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:49.119 

okay<00:04:44.960> so<00:04:46.120> look<00:04:47.120> at<00:04:47.240> this<00:04:47.389> one<00:04:47.629> thing<00:04:47.840> the<00:04:48.710> air

00:04:49.119 --> 00:04:49.129 
okay so look at this one thing the air

00:04:49.129 --> 00:04:51.550 
okay so look at this one thing the air
comes<00:04:49.460> in<00:04:49.780> passes<00:04:50.780> through<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:51.289> this<00:04:51.409> is

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
comes in passes through here this is

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.290 
comes in passes through here this is
actually<00:04:51.740> called<00:04:51.979> a<00:04:52.310> plenum<00:04:52.729> right<00:04:52.909> here<00:04:53.150> this

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
actually called a plenum right here this

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.890 
actually called a plenum right here this
is<00:04:53.449> a<00:04:53.539> plenum<00:04:54.039> go<00:04:55.039> through<00:04:55.490> and<00:04:56.449> it's<00:04:56.629> got<00:04:56.780> to

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
is a plenum go through and it's got to

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.809 
is a plenum go through and it's got to
go<00:04:57.050> to<00:04:57.110> each<00:04:57.740> individual<00:04:58.639> cylinder<00:05:00.430> so<00:05:01.430> as<00:05:01.610> in

00:05:01.809 --> 00:05:01.819 
go to each individual cylinder so as in

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:04.809 
go to each individual cylinder so as in
my<00:05:02.030> vehicle<00:05:02.750> I've<00:05:03.289> got<00:05:03.620> ten<00:05:03.949> cylinders<00:05:04.430> it's

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
there's air in the cylinder head there's

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.730 
there's air in the cylinder head there's
fuel

00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:50.740 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:57.089 

see<00:05:51.669> ya<00:05:52.139> so<00:05:55.050> explain<00:05:56.050> to<00:05:56.080> me<00:05:56.199> how<00:05:56.619> this

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
see ya so explain to me how this

00:05:57.099 --> 00:06:01.170 
see ya so explain to me how this
throttle<00:05:57.580> body<00:05:58.029> spacer<00:05:59.309> is<00:06:00.309> going<00:06:00.610> to<00:06:00.669> work<00:06:00.909> in

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 
throttle body spacer is going to work in

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.589 
throttle body spacer is going to work in
this<00:06:01.360> type<00:06:01.629> of<00:06:01.689> setup<00:06:04.619> so<00:06:05.619> it's<00:06:05.800> so<00:06:06.669> it's<00:06:07.059> been

00:06:07.589 --> 00:06:07.599 
this type of setup so it's so it's been

00:06:07.599 --> 00:06:09.719 
this type of setup so it's so it's been
in<00:06:07.719> the<00:06:07.839> air<00:06:07.869> or<00:06:08.499> doing<00:06:08.830> whatever<00:06:09.039> it<00:06:09.309> is<00:06:09.369> up

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
in the air or doing whatever it is up

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:13.350 
in the air or doing whatever it is up
here<00:06:10.119> but<00:06:10.899> it's<00:06:11.020> not<00:06:11.110> mixing<00:06:11.529> the<00:06:11.589> fuel<00:06:12.360> feels

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
here but it's not mixing the fuel feels

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:20.399

delivered<00:06:13.899> way<00:06:14.050> down<00:06:14.289> here<00:06:14.860> I<00:06:19.289> think<00:06:20.289> this

00:06:20.399 --> 00:06:20.409 
delivered way down here I think this

00:06:20.409 --> 00:06:23.519 
delivered way down here I think this
thing's<00:06:20.649> useless<00:06:21.719> on<00:06:22.719> a<00:06:22.779> fuel-injected

00:06:23.519 --> 00:06:23.529

see<00:06:52.569> some<00:06:52.779> real<00:06:53.020> interesting<00:06:53.949> designs<00:06:54.399> I

00:06:54.629 --> 00:06:54.639 
see some real interesting designs I

00:06:54.639 --> 00:06:57.149 
see some real interesting designs I
think<00:06:54.879> BMW<00:06:55.749> somebody<00:06:56.139> hi<00:06:56.349> use<00:06:56.649> audit<00:06:56.949> cars

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:57.159 
think BMW somebody hi use audit cars

00:06:57.159 --> 00:07:00.389 
think BMW somebody hi use audit cars
have<00:06:57.849> a<00:06:57.879> throttle<00:06:58.689> body<00:06:58.899> for<00:06:59.349> each<00:06:59.499> individual

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:00.399 
have a throttle body for each individual

00:07:00.399 --> 00:07:03.449 
have a throttle body for each individual
cylinder<00:07:01.589> and<00:07:02.589> you<00:07:02.709> wonder<00:07:02.889> why<00:07:03.039> those<00:07:03.219> cars

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:03.459 
cylinder and you wonder why those cars

00:07:03.459 --> 00:07:06.029 
cylinder and you wonder why those cars
are<00:07:03.610> so<00:07:03.789> expensive<00:07:04.499> well<00:07:05.499> you<00:07:05.620> might<00:07:05.769> want<00:07:05.979> to

00:07:06.029 --> 00:07:06.039 
are so expensive well you might want to

00:07:06.039 --> 00:07:09.119 
are so expensive well you might want to
looking<00:07:06.309> at<00:07:06.490> BMW<00:07:07.180> I<00:07:07.539> think<00:07:07.719> it's<00:07:07.809> m1<00:07:08.409> and<00:07:09.009> then

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:09.129 
looking at BMW I think it's m1 and then

00:07:09.129 --> 00:07:13.559 
looking at BMW I think it's m1 and then
one<00:07:09.370> engine<00:07:10.050> yeah<00:07:11.459> one<00:07:12.459> throttle<00:07:12.909> body<00:07:13.089> for

00:07:13.559 --> 00:07:13.569 
one engine yeah one throttle body for

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:19.799 
one engine yeah one throttle body for
each<00:07:14.159> cylinder<00:07:15.159> later<00:07:15.879> that<00:07:16.089> one<00:07:16.240> v12<00:07:18.689> it's<00:07:19.689> an

00:07:19.799 --> 00:07:19.809 
each cylinder later that one v12 it's an

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:22.379 
each cylinder later that one v12 it's an
interesting<00:07:20.259> setup<00:07:20.740> and<00:07:21.669> I<00:07:21.999> don't<00:07:22.180> think

00:07:22.379 --> 00:07:22.389 
interesting setup and I don't think

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:24.959 
interesting setup and I don't think
they're<00:07:22.509> using<00:07:22.959> I<00:07:23.430> don't<00:07:24.430> think<00:07:24.669> any<00:07:24.789> of<00:07:24.879> those

00:07:24.959 --> 00:07:24.969 
they're using I don't think any of those

00:07:24.969 --> 00:07:29.179 
they're using I don't think any of those
expensive<00:07:25.509> cars<00:07:25.749> use<00:07:26.050> throttle<00:07:26.439> body<00:07:26.589> spacers
