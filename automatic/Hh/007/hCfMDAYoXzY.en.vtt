00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:10.030
 an armada bringing death on the way to 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.829
 alternate universe the warrior falls from 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:18.630
 blow which does not see but why I 

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:23.230
 did not see of course they tried to kill me 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:28.870
 kill it their job for such a question not 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.230
 about what happened in what happened 

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.230
 with me 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:43.170
 yes km carrying death and she alone wanted 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.900
 crown me others cut myself 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.970
 I have a throat 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.970
 until they decided to crown him 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.570
 each lot marshal receives privileges then 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:08.090
 which i have never had 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:08.090
 I was too relaxed I had to leave 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.360
 anywhere or just come back 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.930
 sometimes I think that you never sleep 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:29.910
 lord marshal no one can enter 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:34.320
 here and not meet you facing 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:37.380
 face that's why they want to kill you 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:44.060
 they consider you unnatural 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.060
 center damned something ugly 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.399
 and what to do if so born 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.780
 you think the guard is still there 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.570
 what is the shortest way to a man's heart 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:19.860
 between the fourth and fifth edge 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.940
 and if you do not make a mistake your enemy will be in time 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.940
 just wonder 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:43.689
 and easier 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.650
 gyumri 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.050
 time is over 

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.849
 how could they get as close as 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.849
 i could be so blind 

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:59.489
 the judge said between the fourth and fifth is 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:06.739
 fifth and sixth 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:06.739
 knowledge of the body like this 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:20.220
 but who directed her such a commander 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:20.220
 could be anyone and I still doubted 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:29.490
 lacquer commander 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.490
 word marshal you can make friends 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.400
 What do you want 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:50.780
 in the crown silver transition seems to me more 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.780
 long not get rid of this 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:08.980
 will be able to buy something and never somewhere am I lost 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:12.630
 from my path I decided that I was invulnerable 

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:12.630
 committed the worst of crimes 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:23.160
 became civilized now the countdown went to 

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:24.630
 I have to find my animal again 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:27.590
 essence 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:27.590
 riddick
