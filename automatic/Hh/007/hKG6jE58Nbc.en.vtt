00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
more spacious and I really like that is

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.340 
more spacious and I really like that is
laid<00:01:47.909> out<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.240> way<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.750> just<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.200> much

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
laid out this way it's just so much

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.870 
laid out this way it's just so much
better<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.770> type<00:01:50.009> on<00:01:50.220> as<00:01:50.399> you<00:01:50.520> can<00:01:50.670> see

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
better to type on as you can see

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.580 
better to type on as you can see
everything<00:01:51.720> works<00:01:51.869> really<00:01:52.079> well<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.409> if<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
everything works really well and if you

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.200 
everything works really well and if you
can't<00:01:52.799> see<00:01:52.979> that<00:01:53.009> then<00:01:53.189> sorry<00:01:53.880> I'm<00:01:54.060> not

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
can't see that then sorry I'm not

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.139 
can't see that then sorry I'm not
zooming<00:01:54.659> in<00:01:54.750> but<00:01:55.079> yeah<00:01:55.439> hey<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:56.460> works<00:01:56.729> much

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
zooming in but yeah hey it works much

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.330 
zooming in but yeah hey it works much
better<00:01:57.210> and<00:01:58.049> if<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.350> again<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:58.979> look<00:01:59.189> at

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
better and if you know again you look at

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
better and if you know again you look at
the<00:01:59.460> difference<00:01:59.939> between<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.450> one<00:02:00.689> it's

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
the difference between this one it's

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.469 
the difference between this one it's
just<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.350> much<00:02:01.619> bigger<00:02:02.070> keyboard<00:02:02.430> if<00:02:03.180> there's

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
just so much bigger keyboard if there's

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.749 
just so much bigger keyboard if there's
spaces<00:02:03.990> in<00:02:04.110> between<00:02:04.140> and<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.979> really<00:02:05.310> like<00:02:05.490> it

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
spaces in between and I really like it

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.540 
spaces in between and I really like it
and<00:02:05.969> yeah<00:02:06.810> it's<00:02:07.290> great<00:02:07.860> there's<00:02:08.190> a<00:02:08.280> much

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
and yeah it's great there's a much

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.219 
and yeah it's great there's a much
better<00:02:08.849> than<00:02:09.209> that<00:02:09.360> but<00:02:09.569> this<00:02:09.720> one<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.020> cool

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
better than that but this one is cool

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.110 
better than that but this one is cool
too<00:02:10.500> but<00:02:10.709> I<00:02:10.770> really<00:02:11.069> like<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.400> so<00:02:11.610> although<00:02:11.879> I

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
too but I really like this so although I

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.020 
too but I really like this so although I
think<00:02:12.360> this<00:02:12.599> is<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.720> kill

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
think this is a kill

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.510 
think this is a kill
device<00:02:13.360> is<00:02:13.569> gonna<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:13.990> probably<00:02:14.440> for<00:02:14.530> $99<00:02:15.400> like

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
device is gonna so probably for $99 like

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.070 
device is gonna so probably for $99 like
the<00:02:15.640> old<00:02:15.880> one<00:02:16.120> did<00:02:16.360> they<00:02:16.540> dropped<00:02:16.750> the<00:02:16.870> price

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
the old one did they dropped the price

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.320 
the old one did they dropped the price
of<00:02:17.260> the<00:02:17.350> diner<00:02:17.590> rider<00:02:17.890> to<00:02:18.250> the<00:02:18.490> 89<00:02:18.970> they<00:02:19.180> have

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
of the diner rider to the 89 they have

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.820 
of the diner rider to the 89 they have
not<00:02:19.480> listed<00:02:19.750> a<00:02:19.810> price<00:02:19.990> for<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.290> one<00:02:20.470> because

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
not listed a price for this one because

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.170 
not listed a price for this one because
it's<00:02:20.980> so<00:02:21.220> new<00:02:21.459> but<00:02:21.670> I<00:02:21.700> think<00:02:21.850> it's<00:02:21.940> gonna<00:02:22.030> be

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:22.180 
it's so new but I think it's gonna be

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.480 
it's so new but I think it's gonna be
around<00:02:22.270> $99<00:02:23.110> and<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.380> might<00:02:23.620> seem<00:02:23.860> high<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.160> some

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
around $99 and I might seem high to some

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.880 
around $99 and I might seem high to some
of<00:02:24.610> you<00:02:24.730> about<00:02:24.940> remember<00:02:25.270> it's<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:25.959> folio<00:02:26.470> which

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
of you about remember it's a folio which

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:28.590 
of you about remember it's a folio which
is<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:27.310> know<00:02:27.430> can<00:02:27.610> be<00:02:27.760> worth<00:02:27.940> 40<00:02:28.330> or<00:02:28.390> 50

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
is you know can be worth 40 or 50

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.270 
is you know can be worth 40 or 50
dollars<00:02:28.720> by<00:02:29.020> itself<00:02:29.050> and<00:02:29.680> it<00:02:29.980> has<00:02:30.010> the

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
dollars by itself and it has the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:31.620 
dollars by itself and it has the
keyboard<00:02:30.760> which<00:02:30.910> they<00:02:31.180> are<00:02:31.330> kind<00:02:31.569> of

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
keyboard which they are kind of

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.630 
keyboard which they are kind of
expensive<00:02:31.930> so<00:02:32.260> altogether<00:02:32.950> I<00:02:33.250> think<00:02:33.489> it's<00:02:33.610> a

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
expensive so altogether I think it's a

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.979 
expensive so altogether I think it's a
good<00:02:33.760> value<00:02:33.970> for<00:02:34.270> that<00:02:34.330> price<00:02:34.540> but<00:02:34.720> that's

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
good value for that price but that's

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.240 
good value for that price but that's
something<00:02:35.260> for<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.680> decide<00:02:35.920> oh<00:02:36.100> by<00:02:36.220> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
something for you to decide oh by the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.890 
something for you to decide oh by the
way<00:02:36.340> as<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.610> mentioned<00:02:36.940> in<00:02:37.030> Monday's<00:02:37.390> video<00:02:37.569> I'm

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
way as I mentioned in Monday's video I'm

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.780 
way as I mentioned in Monday's video I'm
