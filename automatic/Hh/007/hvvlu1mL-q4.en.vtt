students<00:01:34.520> put<00:01:34.759> into<00:01:34.970> practice<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:35.479> they've

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
students put into practice what they've

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.830 
students put into practice what they've

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.139 
learned in the classroom into real-world
situations<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:40.130> interesting<00:01:40.549> thing<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.880> that

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
situations the interesting thing is that

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.920 
situations the interesting thing is that
we<00:01:41.990> normally<00:01:42.560> think<00:01:42.590> of<00:01:42.979> smaller<00:01:43.399> private

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
we normally think of smaller private

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.420 
we normally think of smaller private
institutions<00:01:44.930> as<00:01:45.170> being<00:01:45.799> the<00:01:45.920> ones<00:01:46.130> that<00:01:46.340> are

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:46.430 
institutions as being the ones that are

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.700 
institutions as being the ones that are
likely<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.850> excel<00:01:47.450> in<00:01:47.479> that<00:01:47.719> kind<00:01:48.170> of<00:01:48.259> teaching

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 
likely to excel in that kind of teaching

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.499 
likely to excel in that kind of teaching
and<00:01:48.799> learning<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.759> it's<00:01:49.909> a<00:01:50.000> tradition<00:01:50.479> here

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
and learning but it's a tradition here

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.859 
and learning but it's a tradition here
at<00:01:50.750> UNCW<00:01:51.350> and<00:01:51.920> we're<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> middle-sized<00:01:53.149> state

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
at UNCW and we're a middle-sized state

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.569 
at UNCW and we're a middle-sized state
institutions<00:01:54.710> so<00:01:54.950> that's<00:01:55.159> something<00:01:55.399> that

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
institutions so that's something that

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.060 
institutions so that's something that
we're<00:01:55.939> very<00:01:56.180> proud<00:01:56.930> of<00:01:57.200> and<00:01:57.469> we<00:01:57.619> think<00:01:57.829> it's<00:01:57.979> a

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:58.070 
we're very proud of and we think it's a

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.389 
we're very proud of and we think it's a
distinctive<00:01:58.700> feature<00:01:58.969> of<00:01:59.229> UNCW<00:02:00.229> in<00:02:01.159> the

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:01.399 
distinctive feature of UNCW in the

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:03.700 
distinctive feature of UNCW in the

Department of Environmental Studies the
environment<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.549> the<00:02:04.579> classroom<00:02:05.240> through

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
environment is the classroom through

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.460 
environment is the classroom through
internships<00:02:06.670> my<00:02:07.670> internship<00:02:08.329> is<00:02:08.600> working<00:02:09.380> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
internships my internship is working a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.170 
internships my internship is working a
regulatory<00:02:09.859> at<00:02:10.340> the<00:02:10.579> Army<00:02:10.970> Corps<00:02:11.000> of

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
regulatory at the Army Corps of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.840 
regulatory at the Army Corps of
Engineers<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.470> I<00:02:12.500> work<00:02:12.950> with<00:02:13.070> wetlands<00:02:13.430> a<00:02:13.670> lot

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:13.850 
Engineers so I work with wetlands a lot

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.330 
Engineers so I work with wetlands a lot
so<00:02:14.209> I<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.690> in<00:02:14.780> the<00:02:14.870> field<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.470> do<00:02:15.950> hands-on

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
so I get in the field and do hands-on

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.040 
so I get in the field and do hands-on
activities<00:02:16.880> with<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.090> wetlands

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
activities with the wetlands

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.380 
activities with the wetlands
I<00:02:18.110> think<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.070> applied<00:02:19.370> learning<00:02:19.640> initiative

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
I think the applied learning initiative

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.930 
I think the applied learning initiative
helps<00:02:20.930> in<00:02:21.470> the<00:02:21.560> future<00:02:21.890> with<00:02:22.160> jobs<00:02:22.490> just

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
helps in the future with jobs just

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.250 
helps in the future with jobs just
because<00:02:23.060> you<00:02:23.390> meet<00:02:23.570> people<00:02:23.750> you<00:02:23.960> learn<00:02:24.140> how<00:02:24.230> to

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
because you meet people you learn how to

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.590 
because you meet people you learn how to
network<00:02:24.500> how<00:02:25.280> to<00:02:25.340> interact<00:02:25.730> with<00:02:26.060> them<00:02:26.240> it's

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:26.600 
network how to interact with them it's

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.380 
network how to interact with them it's
basically<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.320> job<00:02:27.880> so<00:02:28.880> you<00:02:28.910> get<00:02:29.120> a<00:02:29.150> little

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
basically a job so you get a little

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.180 
basically a job so you get a little
first-hand<00:02:30.050> look<00:02:30.470> at<00:02:30.650> it<00:02:30.800> before<00:02:30.950> you

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
first-hand look at it before you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:33.430 
first-hand look at it before you
actually<00:02:31.370> get<00:02:31.580> out<00:02:31.670> into<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:31.880> field<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.440> you

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
actually get out into the field and you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.900 
actually get out into the field and you
start<00:02:33.680> doing<00:02:33.890> it<00:02:33.920> for<00:02:34.160> real<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.640> it's<00:02:34.730> kind<00:02:34.880> of

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
start doing it for real so it's kind of

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.120 
start doing it for real so it's kind of
like<00:02:35.030> a<00:02:35.090> test<00:02:35.630> run<00:02:35.840> if<00:02:36.290> you<00:02:36.410> get<00:02:36.590> out<00:02:36.680> there<00:02:36.920> and

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
like a test run if you get out there and

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.980 
like a test run if you get out there and
interact<00:02:37.490> with<00:02:37.640> people<00:02:37.970> that<00:02:38.240> do<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.810> every

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:38.990 
interact with people that do it every

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:41.260 
interact with people that do it every
day<00:02:39.160> really<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.190> think<00:02:40.280> it's<00:02:40.580> important<00:02:41.240> for

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:41.270 
day really I think it's important for

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:43.750 
day really I think it's important for
all<00:02:41.480> University<00:02:42.200> students<00:02:42.620> to<00:02:42.980> be<00:02:43.160> working<00:02:43.640> in

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
all University students to be working in

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.810 
all University students to be working in
some<00:02:43.940> sort<00:02:44.150> of<00:02:44.270> service<00:02:45.050> capacity<00:02:45.460> this<00:02:46.460> is<00:02:46.640> a

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
some sort of service capacity this is a

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.390 
some sort of service capacity this is a
really<00:02:47.150> good<00:02:47.300> way<00:02:47.450> to<00:02:47.990> connect<00:02:48.830> with<00:02:49.070> the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
really good way to connect with the

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.890 
really good way to connect with the
community<00:02:49.520> outside<00:02:49.940> that's<00:02:50.570> the<00:02:50.720> critical

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
community outside that's the critical

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.890 
community outside that's the critical
part<00:02:51.380> that<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.620> become<00:02:51.980> stewards<00:02:52.760> of<00:02:53.210> the

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
part that you become stewards of the

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.280 
part that you become stewards of the
community<00:02:54.320> you<00:02:54.470> work<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.920> and<00:02:55.190> so<00:02:56.200> so<00:02:57.200> you

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.290 
community you work in and so so you

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:59.200 
community you work in and so so you
don't<00:02:57.320> it's<00:02:57.800> not<00:02:57.950> just<00:02:58.160> the<00:02:58.250> skills<00:02:58.550> that<00:02:58.940> you
