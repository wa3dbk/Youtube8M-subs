00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:05.940

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.080
 if you have seen my we are very late 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.040
 there we have to go there, but that's 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.780
 what is this watch there 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.759
 how was it a lot what is it 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.929
 it is the age and watch it is the lg g here 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.179
 the first watch under android open 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.490
 my buddy away android were this is the 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 new google special android for 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.390
 the known objects that a little jealous 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.189
 yeah this shows just released 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.470
 this is the first android watch were 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.670
 it is lg who makes it while at this 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.330
 that it's worth this climb what are 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.460
 his limits 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.240
 our friend christopher these mini attested 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.240
 here we go 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.480
 as you see it's lg is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.649
 totally devoid of button 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.120
 unlike a traditional watch 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.800
 why because she obviously has a 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.840
 touch screen and control it as 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.730
 by voice to function so 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.710
 optimal and an android watch were 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.809
 must have brought a phone under 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.939
 android obligatorily and for good reason 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.530
 on the screen of the watch one is displayed and 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.670
 the set of notifications that you 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.140
 find in a fairly classic way 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.619
 usually on your screen 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.439
 phone 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.030
 so that's the sms the mails and 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.369
 push your news applications 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.020
 prefer the push of your games on 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.750
 android and so that's all 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.009
 notifications that go into the pane of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.869
 your phone end up on 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.070
 the watch screen love can 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:27.689
 also display all of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.210
 information that comes from google 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 nawal intelligent assistant from google 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.829
 that is the weather of where 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.390
 locate information about 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.479
 your agenda your next appointments 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.829
 but also the route according to 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.270
 time of day the trip to the 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.270
 house where the trip to the office 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.460
 if you use your smartphone as gps 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.150
 we can use the watch to dictate to 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.500
 his smartphone 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:14.880
 an address route to 12 rue 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:17.940
 oradour on glane paris the itinerary 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.490
 then appears on the phone but the 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.440
 problem if like 95% of users 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.310
 of android you use a code for 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.970
 unlock the screen 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:29.340
 after a while the screen crashes and 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.750
 requires action on the phone the 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.820
 blow the voice recognition loses a 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.320
 little of his meaning and his interest so 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.000
 you use another application that 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.650
 google maps for navigation in 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.750
 your car the situation gets complicated 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:46.190
 a little bit you can actually launched 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:46.190
 the app launched wise 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:51.270
 but if the screen is locked by code 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.190
 nothing will happen before 

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.320
 that you intervene on the phone 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.580
 again what is the interest of the 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.110
 speech Recognition 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.660
 if you have a manipulation to do 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:02.660
 on your phone launched waze 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.990
 the other interest of recognition 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.610
 voice when you're in your car 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.250
 it is to be able to send an SMS 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:23.010
 directly since the watch sent a 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.480
 sms to jean-david ok for lunch this 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.770
 noon to send a message with 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:28.230
 android were we must do everything from a 

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:29.730
 treats unlike siri on ios who 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.670
 first allows you to select your 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:34.260
 recipient then then to say 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:35.970
 different phrases so to make some 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 messages long enough there if you 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:39.660
 mislead to the second sentence of an SMS 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.620
 which has 5 you are obliged to 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.510
 to start all over 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.890
 android ware is a system for 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.480
 connected watches that is still very 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.070
 young there is a lot of use still to 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.980
 develop and we do not see 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.270
 today enormously the utility charge 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.170
 developers to develop 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.150
 new uses of news 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:56.130
 applications to make this news 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.700
 much more interesting object than he does 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.590
 is today 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.940
 the last question that remains is 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:02.250
 also the autonomy of these devices 

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:03.930
 left lg ladji that we use 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.120
 for a few days already we had to 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.950
 recharge it about every 1 day and 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.630
 half which is still huge for 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.600
 a watch has no stop on you 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.330
 especially since to recharge it 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:17.060
 must pass through this base 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:19.320
 and not by a traditional catch 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.670
 as it is on smartphones 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:22.320
 so you must always have this base 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.620
 carefully what is a real 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.620
 constraint
