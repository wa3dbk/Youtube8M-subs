pack<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:54.119> dry<00:01:54.509> mix<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:56.100> have<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> cut<00:01:56.880> and<00:01:57.030> ready

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
pack of dry mix we have a cut and ready

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.679 
pack of dry mix we have a cut and ready
into<00:01:57.570> them<00:01:57.689> into<00:01:58.079> the<00:01:58.490> extruder<00:01:59.490> and<00:01:59.820> you're

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
into them into the extruder and you're

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.850 
into them into the extruder and you're
gonna<00:02:00.780> add<00:02:01.079> fill<00:02:02.009> one<00:02:02.430> tablespoon<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:04.500> the<00:02:04.619> top

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
smooth not to exceed 30 seconds so let's

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:31.229 
smooth not to exceed 30 seconds so let's
count<00:02:18.110> 1<00:02:18.470> 2<00:02:19.280> 3<00:02:20.140> 4<00:02:21.140> 5<00:02:22.240> 6<00:02:23.240> 7<00:02:24.200> 8<00:02:25.060> 9<00:02:26.080> 10<00:02:27.080> 11<00:02:27.970> 12<00:02:28.970> 13<00:02:30.069> 14

this set to go let's pull the camera
down<00:03:48.650> just<00:03:49.100> a<00:03:49.400> little<00:03:50.140> okay<00:03:51.140> so<00:03:51.200> now<00:03:51.590> the

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
down just a little okay so now the

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.949 
down just a little okay so now the
extruder<00:03:52.519> is<00:03:52.609> ready<00:03:52.880> we're<00:03:53.480> gonna<00:03:53.570> switch

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:53.959 
extruder is ready we're gonna switch

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:56.259 
extruder is ready we're gonna switch
this<00:03:54.200> into<00:03:54.560> the<00:03:54.680> extrude<00:03:55.310> position<00:03:56.090> it's

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
this into the extrude position it's

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.849 
this into the extrude position it's
locked<00:03:56.570> in<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:57.260> here<00:03:57.890> we<00:03:58.040> go

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
locked in and here we go

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:07.130 
locked in and here we go
it<00:04:00.859> looks<00:04:01.100> like<00:04:01.250> marshmallow

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:17.620 

it<00:04:07.710> is<00:04:07.920> marshmallow<00:04:09.380> let's<00:04:10.380> make<00:04:10.560> a<00:04:10.590> ball<00:04:14.840> okay

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:17.630 
it is marshmallow let's make a ball okay

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:20.000 
it is marshmallow let's make a ball okay
so<00:04:18.630> it<00:04:18.720> just<00:04:18.930> says<00:04:19.049> extrude<00:04:19.530> them<00:04:19.650> into<00:04:19.890> your

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
so it just says extrude them into your

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:26.120 
so it just says extrude them into your
mold<00:04:21.770> there<00:04:22.770> you<00:04:22.890> go<00:04:24.080> so<00:04:25.080> set<00:04:25.350> aside<00:04:25.650> for<00:04:25.860> five

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 
mold there you go so set aside for five

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.380 
mold there you go so set aside for five
minutes<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.640> we're<00:04:26.730> gonna<00:04:26.850> have<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.210> make

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
minutes so we're gonna have to make

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:36.670 
minutes so we're gonna have to make
these<00:04:32.480> I'm<00:04:33.480> making<00:04:33.750> them<00:04:33.840> a<00:04:33.900> little<00:04:34.169> fluffier

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.070 

so<00:04:37.680> let's<00:04:37.800> feel<00:04:38.040> quickly<00:04:38.460> before<00:04:38.850> mold<00:04:39.690> sets

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
so let's feel quickly before mold sets
