00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.710
 to avoid a superinfection they exist they have brought back a place the 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.450
 people under treatment before the intervention it is usually 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.160
 antibiotic coverage for me I'm used to pressure of 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.099
 corticosteroids also because it allows 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.369
 to drink one of the following postoperative easier 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.560
 like them for all 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.510
 two prostheses posed by fitting for them the beginning of a good health the 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.730
 it is important to have good hygiene 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.940
 but his pass to afellay by the preliminary examinations and passion that come 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.649
 to see us to receive the children with a deplorable oral hygiene 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.329
 it would make him understand that it is necessary first of all to be able to 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:52.559
 check your oral hygiene before considering implant placement 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.970
 global studies 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.359
 all sectors combined we have a failure rate 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:03.949
 of 3 5% 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.890
 that means that in 3 5% of cases we will see the losc which does not rebuild itself 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.470
 properly around the plant and therefore poor fixation of this magnitude 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.510
 it is usually determined at the end of the face to the spirou integration 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:23.500
 who I remind you and it's basically between 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:24.820
 mosque 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.650
 four to six months depending on the local conditions of the cooperating sector 

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.030
 if the implant is not reintegrated, simply remove it 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.600
 they proposed again 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.900
 the program that tried to dig it when laying the first rail 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.530
 plan will create local conditions 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.000
 which usually between them allow for a near systematic zero success 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.130
 finally 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.530
 the eyes one can have complications for a treatment was done a little 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.149
 afraid because we have to come up with a plan 

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.409
 but to better end up almost never in the impossibility finally with 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.200
 a complete failure helen passion they said but ultimately we can nothing 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.739
 to do for you
