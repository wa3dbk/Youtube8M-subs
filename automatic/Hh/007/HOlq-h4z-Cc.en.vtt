00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
mean it'll help the sound more of the

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:24.169 
mean it'll help the sound more of the
sound<00:00:09.450> will<00:00:09.599> coming

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:24.179 

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:27.630 

what<00:00:25.179> I<00:00:25.210> find<00:00:25.660> very<00:00:25.750> interesting<00:00:26.019> here<00:00:26.919> is<00:00:27.250> on

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
what I find very interesting here is on

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.049 
what I find very interesting here is on
any<00:00:28.599> other<00:00:28.899> piano<00:00:29.410> including<00:00:30.369> a<00:00:30.460> modern<00:00:30.609> piano

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:31.059 
any other piano including a modern piano

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:33.150 
any other piano including a modern piano
or<00:00:31.210> any<00:00:31.300> of<00:00:31.480> these<00:00:31.599> I<00:00:31.660> would<00:00:32.050> it's<00:00:32.590> not<00:00:32.619> easy<00:00:32.949> to

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
or any of these I would it's not easy to

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.060 
or any of these I would it's not easy to
do<00:00:33.340> here<00:00:33.579> one<00:00:34.269> would<00:00:34.449> play<00:00:34.660> more<00:00:34.930> like<00:00:35.079> this

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.250 

with<00:00:39.070> less<00:00:39.370> left<00:00:39.610> hand<00:00:39.879> yes<00:00:40.059> but<00:00:40.540> I<00:00:40.570> find<00:00:40.989> not

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
with less left hand yes but I find not

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.869 
with less left hand yes but I find not
only<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.649> that<00:00:41.800> hard<00:00:42.040> to<00:00:42.100> do<00:00:42.370> here<00:00:42.610> but<00:00:42.730> it

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
only is that hard to do here but it

00:00:42.879 --> 00:01:01.819 
only is that hard to do here but it
seems<00:00:47.729> makes<00:00:48.729> the<00:00:48.970> treble<00:00:49.420> sound

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829
