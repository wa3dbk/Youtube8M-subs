 it is a spring day in 1910, a town waiting for you a few kilometers from 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:10.999
 vienna near the banks of the danube a 6-year-old child plays with a 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.149
 a few days old duckling notices that there is no one who does not follow anywhere 

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:19.369
 that child whose name ecocard lorenzetti will discover the phenomenon 

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:23.349
 of imprinting and will become one of the founders of modern ethology 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:27.499
 for child will continue to follow their geese and ducks all their lives

 that man there is obvious they will tell each other 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.899
 I am here 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:36.480

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.180
 profile roberto michele himself asked why I dedicate so much work 70 research 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.060
 with wild geese 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.660
 I can also answer this question simply with motivations 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.470
 strongly rational 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.830
 I don't know of any other bird that has such a complex family life 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.830
 and lasting 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:22.180
 no bird for which the social structure is determined in 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.230
 so complex way reality from the superstructure of various families e 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.390
 no animal that can be kept in such large quantities together with 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.390
 such a low cost and even in absolute freedom 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.979
 and this is also based on a precise process for now the so-called intrigue 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.359
 anti-google meebo belong tonight 

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:46.359
 preferred for 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.880
 to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.479
 and if I tell you that this is the reason behind geese research 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.560
 wild 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.130
 I tell you the truth, but not the whole truth 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.370
 life is complete when I was 5 years old 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:07.969
 the ducks have left their imprinting in me 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.090
 transfermarkt I passionately wanted to have a 3 and this 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.120
 because through the travels of the little sleepy nils olga told me to 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.369
 malaga corso 

00:02:18.369 --> 00:02:23.459
 I have suffered for ever the influence of the ryanair wild geese the geese I do not 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.539
 I could have them because in the garden they create too much confusion too much damage 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:33.639
 omg and so I settled for a courtyard duck and with the occasion I discovered 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:36.079
 imprinting 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.329
 in fact I noticed that a duck backyard chick that my mother had 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:44.029
 bought for a crown from close fortune teller bauer 

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:45.850
 but I still don't remember perfectly 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.429
 he followed me 

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:52.519
 I still remember perfectly every single expressive gesture itod sound 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.549
 of this small courtyard duck mark 

00:02:55.549 --> 00:02:59.510
 and since my wife already was then my closest collaborator 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.510
 you must also have a note 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.899
 this is the demo bag 2 days later and then I realized that 

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:13.089
 my wife's duck called hp-ux r while my piaxe was 

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:17.469
 in short, I realized that pleasure had the imprint of following the man while 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:18.159
 tu sert 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.629
 no internet my wife still does not want to admit what a pleasure it was 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.749
 behind much better than cox text and from this nature I started ethology 

00:03:27.749 --> 00:03:30.209
 enter and what the years ago 

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.259
 4 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:35.259

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:39.229
 conad lorenzo 

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:42.709
 was born to others November 27, 1903 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.689
 the lorenza family had built a large house with a silk garden 

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:51.209
 the greatest passion of the hill was that of penetrating liquid birds 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:53.199
 there is a big star 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:55.019
 he recognized every species 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.229
 and kept a diary in which he noted the behavior of the birds 

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.019
 in the skies a function to which lorenzo e rossi, very young 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.249
 go well you have street an intense friendship with a child daughter of the 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:08.829
 neighbors 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:13.530
 it was called margherita in the dark it became a companion of konrad games e 

00:04:13.529 --> 00:04:17.519
 then life companion like the accounts of some kinds of works 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:21.829
 conrad I would send you that they would have remained side by side inseparable 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:22.979
 For all life 

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.979
 the adolescent lorenzo was also a passionate reader 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:31.460
 he devoured books on botanical zoology, ornithology but also on history philosophy 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.749
 and literature 

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:33.979
 discover darwin 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:37.049
 and became a fervent supporter of the theory of evolution 

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:40.960
 he decided to be a zoologist or paleontologist 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.980
 in 1900 33 he graduated in zoology 

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:49.979
 lost October 8 of behavior choices 9 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.009
 but I believe that having to close street closes the eyes and little more than that period 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.090
 as far as Europe is concerned, especially in the north of Europe 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.180
 driver's corollas 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:07.670
 full-speed downloads even outside the behavior of the new course 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.189
 peacemaker 

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:12.610
 this area that fades psychology work 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:18.169
 I am very often of animals as a perfect paradigm for television 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:22.089
 no man on his behavior on the cumana conforms deep 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:27.409
 in the early 1900s the Russian scientist Ivan Pavlov won the Nobel Prize 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:31.240
 you also study the animals to me as you would study a map 

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:35.619
 paolo had discovered working primarily with dogs that he is a 

00:05:35.619 --> 00:05:39.859
 spontaneous reflex like that of salivation when a food is savored 

00:05:39.859 --> 00:05:43.589
 if another external stimulus is often associated, such as the sound of one 

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:46.669
 bell can become a conditioned reflex 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:50.949
 meanwhile in the united states the already bitten psychologist had founded the 

00:05:50.949 --> 00:05:55.939
 school of behaviors doing experiments on mice dogs pishing panze 

00:05:55.939 --> 00:06:00.809
 baron's skinner following behaviorist theories argued that instinct 

00:06:00.809 --> 00:06:05.419
 counted little or nothing and that any behavior resulted from 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:08.859
 automatic reflexes resulting from learning processes 

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:12.999
 for the scientific world used to seeing animals as robots 

00:06:12.999 --> 00:06:15.660
 programmed by rewards from punishments 

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.380
 lorenzo's imprinting experiments to present a real one 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:23.390
 upset when I started with the works and it is not yet clear to me that 

00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:25.360
 the imprinting is not relative 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.150
 who is an indelible phenomenon 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.889
 however, I didn't want my first wild goose to have an imprint 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.960
 hand to the Pope had been hatched by a white barnyard goose 

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:39.220
 and was therefore the first wild goose chick I had ever seen 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.409
 understandably I was curious 

00:06:41.409 --> 00:06:45.800
 I played a couple of hours with this chick the penis after which I wanted 

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.279
 push it immediately from the courtyard 

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:50.869
 I did it but the trauma was accomplished 

00:06:50.869 --> 00:06:55.929
 this little wild goose didn't even want to die to have anything to do 

00:06:55.929 --> 00:07:00.389
 with the farmyard goose helmet ok he came after me crying loudly 

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.839
 that is doing for 

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:05.839
 router ie 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:11.360
 and this term do not always miss it 

00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.399
 consider the English terminology a little because imprinting 

00:07:15.399 --> 00:07:19.210
 comments to this sense the gerund fb to come 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:23.399
 you saw doctor reality is not something to which animal comments 

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:28.649
 he remains crucified for ever but unfortunately it is not a phenomenon 

00:07:28.649 --> 00:07:31.649
 this animal mind with its experiences can also change 

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.069
 so usually 

00:07:34.069 --> 00:07:35.970
 yes provision to be seen 

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:40.850
 example the minced since small here is to what really very different the 

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:45.490
 own natural mother what one would expect just this is useful then 

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:47.869
 if this is in contact with 

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:52.249
 subjects autodesk cmq solemare completely lose their identity 

00:07:52.779 --> 00:07:58.379
 temporary - thank you forever translation despite big posters 

00:07:58.379 --> 00:08:03.759
 be careful as a human being if you will find long periods of time for 

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:07.419
 besides erice true deviant behavior more porn
