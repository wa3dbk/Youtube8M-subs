as doing the white painting let's get

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:12.919 
as doing the white painting let's get
into<00:00:11.460> the<00:00:11.580> stage<00:00:11.790> now<00:00:12.059> where<00:00:12.090> it's<00:00:12.420> not<00:00:12.719> nearly

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
into the stage now where it's not nearly

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:15.860 
into the stage now where it's not nearly
covered<00:00:13.200> all<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:14.030> separate<00:00:15.030> sections<00:00:15.809> of

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
covered all of the separate sections of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.010 
covered all of the separate sections of
the<00:00:15.960> caterpillar<00:00:20.119> oops<00:00:21.119> there's<00:00:21.539> a<00:00:21.600> bit<00:00:21.779> there

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
the caterpillar oops there's a bit there

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.820 
the caterpillar oops there's a bit there
where<00:00:22.199> I've<00:00:22.640> got<00:00:23.640> red<00:00:23.910> paint<00:00:24.180> on<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> wrong

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:24.830 
where I've got red paint on the wrong

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.390 
where I've got red paint on the wrong
full<00:00:25.830> influence<00:00:26.220> on<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.460> wrong<00:00:26.810> segment<00:00:28.400> so

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
full influence on the wrong segment so

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.429 
full influence on the wrong segment so
we're<00:00:29.580> not<00:00:29.609> to<00:00:29.789> do<00:00:29.880> about<00:00:30.029> that<00:00:30.090> change<00:00:30.570> on

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
we're not to do about that change on

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.350 
we're not to do about that change on
there's<00:00:31.890> a<00:00:31.949> bit<00:00:32.130> there<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.489> needs<00:00:32.700> sorting

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
there's a bit there that needs sorting

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:43.069 
there's a bit there that needs sorting
out<00:00:40.940> just<00:00:41.940> key<00:00:42.120> into<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.300> right<00:00:42.480> position<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
out just key into the right position and

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.000 
out just key into the right position and
just<00:00:43.440> blow<00:00:43.649> off<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:44.420> ring<00:00:45.420> on<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.750> do<00:00:46.620> that<00:00:46.649> bit

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
just blow off the ring on it do that bit

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.970 
just blow off the ring on it do that bit
there<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> quite<00:00:47.789> ripe<00:00:48.090> we<00:00:48.360> can<00:00:48.920> make<00:00:49.920> sure

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
there is not quite ripe we can make sure

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.680 
there is not quite ripe we can make sure
it's<00:00:50.250> got<00:00:50.370> more<00:00:50.520> red<00:00:50.760> painted<00:00:51.149> onto<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:53.510> g<00:00:54.510> to

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
it's got more red painted onto it g to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
it's got more red painted onto it g to
grab<00:00:54.930> over<00:00:55.469> here<00:00:55.829> see<00:00:56.250> where<00:00:56.430> their<00:00:56.579> things

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
grab over here see where their things

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.270 
grab over here see where their things
and<00:00:57.000> i<00:00:57.239> still<00:00:57.420> not<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.750> right<00:00:58.050> click<00:01:01.280> these

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and i still not I right click these

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:11.420 
and i still not I right click these
touch<00:01:02.850> up<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.180> that<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:05.390> on<00:01:06.619> there

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:41.560 

obviously<00:01:12.360> on<00:01:12.450> this<00:01:12.600> one<00:01:12.780> here

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.440 

now<00:01:42.230> you'll<00:01:42.380> see<00:01:42.470> I've<00:01:42.740> actually<00:01:42.890> got<00:01:43.220> the<00:01:43.580> the

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
now you'll see I've actually got the the

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.719 
now you'll see I've actually got the the
head<00:01:44.659> there<00:01:44.930> is<00:01:45.110> looking<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.710> bit<00:01:45.740> wrong<00:01:46.159> so<00:01:46.580> I'm

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:46.729 
head there is looking a bit wrong so I'm

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.840 
head there is looking a bit wrong so I'm
going<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:46.880> sort<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.390> out<00:01:51.370> so<00:01:52.370> by<00:01:52.490> turning<00:01:52.700> the

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
going to sort that out so by turning the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.969 
going to sort that out so by turning the
weight<00:01:53.030> down<00:01:53.240> to<00:01:53.450> zero<00:01:53.690> I<00:01:55.300> can<00:01:56.300> now<00:01:56.530> paint<00:01:57.530> lack

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
weight down to zero I can now paint lack

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.190 
weight down to zero I can now paint lack
of<00:01:58.130> influence<00:01:58.550> rather<00:01:59.330> than<00:01:59.540> the<00:01:59.780> influence

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
of influence rather than the influence

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.880 
of influence rather than the influence
on<00:02:00.470> two<00:02:01.509> parts<00:02:02.509> of<00:02:02.630> the<00:02:02.720> mesh<00:02:02.930> same<00:02:03.590> as<00:02:03.710> we<00:02:03.770> did

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
on two parts of the mesh same as we did

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:13.000 
on two parts of the mesh same as we did
before<00:02:04.300> there<00:02:05.300> we<00:02:05.420> are<00:02:10.990> but<00:02:11.990> deforming<00:02:12.770> your

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 
before there we are but deforming your

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.330 
before there we are but deforming your
object<00:02:13.820> or<00:02:14.000> character<00:02:14.540> while<00:02:15.500> you<00:02:15.709> while

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
object or character while you while

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.880 
object or character while you while
you're<00:02:16.489> actually<00:02:16.640> doing<00:02:16.910> the<00:02:17.530> painting<00:02:18.530> like

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:18.890 
you're actually doing the painting like

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.760 
you're actually doing the painting like
this<00:02:18.920> the<00:02:19.250> white<00:02:19.400> painting<00:02:20.350> it's<00:02:21.350> definitely

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
this the white painting it's definitely

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:47.310 
this the white painting it's definitely
the<00:02:21.860> best<00:02:22.010> way<00:02:22.160> to<00:02:22.220> do<00:02:22.459> it

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:49.030 

sometimes<00:02:48.320> get<00:02:48.500> into<00:02:48.710> the<00:02:48.770> right<00:02:48.920> position

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
sometimes get into the right position

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.460 
sometimes get into the right position
can<00:02:49.580> be<00:02:49.610> a<00:02:49.730> bit<00:02:49.910> tricky<00:02:49.990> just<00:02:50.990> keep<00:02:51.230> scrolling

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
can be a bit tricky just keep scrolling

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.030 
can be a bit tricky just keep scrolling
it<00:02:51.830> around<00:02:52.130> so<00:02:52.400> you<00:02:52.430> can<00:02:52.580> manage<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.090> get<00:02:53.420> to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
it around so you can manage to get to

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.530 
it around so you can manage to get to
hope<00:02:55.040> now<00:02:55.610> as<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:55.850> spot<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.270> deliberate

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
hope now as you spot the deliberate

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.180 
hope now as you spot the deliberate
mistake<00:02:56.890> I've<00:02:57.890> got<00:02:58.340> it<00:02:58.430> still<00:02:58.640> set<00:02:58.910> on<00:03:00.190> minimum

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
mistake I've got it still set on minimum

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.680 
mistake I've got it still set on minimum
done<00:03:01.760> 0<00:03:02.060> influence<00:03:02.450> so<00:03:02.980> instead<00:03:03.980> of<00:03:04.040> applying

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
done 0 influence so instead of applying

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:08.020 
done 0 influence so instead of applying
influence<00:03:05.690> i've<00:03:05.900> removed<00:03:06.320> influence<00:03:06.910> need<00:03:07.910> to

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
influence i've removed influence need to

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.600 
influence i've removed influence need to
move<00:03:08.180> that<00:03:08.390> weight<00:03:08.600> slider<00:03:09.170> back<00:03:09.530> up<00:03:09.740> back<00:03:10.459> up

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:10.610 
move that weight slider back up back up

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:16.990 
move that weight slider back up back up
to<00:03:10.790> maximum<00:03:14.830> once<00:03:15.830> I've<00:03:15.980> got<00:03:16.040> that<00:03:16.190> back<00:03:16.640> up<00:03:16.820> to

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
to maximum once I've got that back up to

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.440 
to maximum once I've got that back up to
maximum<00:03:17.410> then<00:03:18.410> once<00:03:18.860> again<00:03:19.160> go<00:03:19.340> in<00:03:19.520> and<00:03:19.700> paint

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
maximum then once again go in and paint

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.110 
maximum then once again go in and paint
that<00:03:20.660> particular<00:03:21.050> bones<00:03:22.570> area<00:03:23.570> there<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:25.120> it

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
that particular bones area there and it

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:39.870 
that particular bones area there and it
starts<00:03:26.510> to<00:03:26.570> go<00:03:26.690> back<00:03:26.900> how<00:03:27.080> I<00:03:27.110> should<00:03:27.380> do

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:39.880 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.820 

now<00:03:40.780> we<00:03:40.840> should<00:03:41.050> be<00:03:41.140> getting<00:03:41.260> there<00:03:41.560> super

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:41.830 
now we should be getting there super

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.870 
now we should be getting there super
position<00:03:42.010> where<00:03:42.280> we<00:03:42.340> can<00:03:42.460> start<00:03:42.670> testing

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
position where we can start testing

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.150 
position where we can start testing
again<00:03:44.100> see<00:03:45.100> what<00:03:45.220> we've<00:03:45.370> got<00:03:46.770> it<00:03:47.770> starting<00:03:48.130> to

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:48.160 
again see what we've got it starting to

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.400 
again see what we've got it starting to
deform<00:03:48.610> bit<00:03:48.790> better<00:03:48.970> still<00:03:49.840> some<00:03:50.200> little

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
deform bit better still some little

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:53.400 
deform bit better still some little
areas<00:03:50.740> that<00:03:50.860> need<00:03:51.010> touching<00:03:51.400> up<00:03:52.410> but

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
areas that need touching up but

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.140 
areas that need touching up but
hopefully<00:03:53.860> by<00:03:53.980> now<00:03:54.130> if<00:03:54.550> you've<00:03:54.760> been<00:03:54.940> trying

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
hopefully by now if you've been trying

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:57.210 
hopefully by now if you've been trying
this<00:03:55.390> with<00:03:55.450> your<00:03:55.690> model<00:03:56.110> you<00:03:56.890> look<00:03:57.040> like<00:03:57.160> a

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:57.220 
this with your model you look like a

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.670 
this with your model you look like a
good<00:03:57.310> idea<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.790> how<00:03:57.910> to<00:03:58.080> weight<00:03:59.080> paint<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.440> model

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
good idea of how to weight paint a model

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.110 
good idea of how to weight paint a model
and<00:03:59.770> it<00:03:59.860> is<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.430> can<00:04:00.520> use<00:04:00.580> envelopes

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.120 
and it is you can use envelopes

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.130 
and it is you can use envelopes
certainly<00:04:01.690> for<00:04:01.780> something<00:04:01.990> like<00:04:02.050> the

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
certainly for something like the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.040 
certainly for something like the
caterpillar<00:04:02.350> you<00:04:02.680> could<00:04:02.800> use<00:04:02.950> it<00:04:02.980> envelopes

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
caterpillar you could use it envelopes

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.680 
caterpillar you could use it envelopes
and<00:04:05.050> you<00:04:05.710> can<00:04:05.860> read<00:04:06.010> about<00:04:06.040> them<00:04:06.430> on<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
and you can read about them on the

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.020 
and you can read about them on the
blender<00:04:07.960> wiki<00:04:08.440> or<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:09.040> the<00:04:09.250> look<00:04:10.000> for

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
blender wiki or on the look for

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:12.060 
blender wiki or on the look for
tutorials<00:04:10.870> there<00:04:11.260> are<00:04:11.410> some<00:04:11.530> tutorials<00:04:11.980> on

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.070 
tutorials there are some tutorials on

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.210 
tutorials there are some tutorials on
the<00:04:12.160> net<00:04:12.340> which<00:04:13.000> you<00:04:13.120> can<00:04:13.240> read<00:04:13.480> but<00:04:14.290> the

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
the net which you can read but the

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:17.240 
the net which you can read but the
envelopes<00:04:15.610> are<00:04:15.760> quite<00:04:15.970> simple<00:04:16.750> to<00:04:16.780> use<00:04:16.840> but

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
envelopes are quite simple to use but

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.199 
envelopes are quite simple to use but
they<00:04:18.250> don't<00:04:18.430> have<00:04:18.580> the<00:04:18.700> same<00:04:18.730> degree<00:04:19.060> of

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
they don't have the same degree of

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.750 
they don't have the same degree of
control<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.840> my<00:04:19.989> opinion<00:04:20.520> certainly<00:04:21.520> when<00:04:21.670> you

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
control in my opinion certainly when you

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.290 
control in my opinion certainly when you
get<00:04:21.940> to<00:04:22.120> more<00:04:22.270> more<00:04:22.870> complex<00:04:23.320> meshes<00:04:23.710> and<00:04:24.300> more

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
get to more more complex meshes and more

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.480 
get to more more complex meshes and more
complex<00:04:25.540> characters<00:04:26.230> you'll<00:04:26.860> you'll<00:04:27.220> need<00:04:27.400> to

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
complex characters you'll you'll need to

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.220 
complex characters you'll you'll need to
have<00:04:27.610> more<00:04:27.760> out<00:04:27.910> of<00:04:27.940> control<00:04:28.060> like<00:04:28.540> doing<00:04:29.140> a

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.230 
have more out of control like doing a

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:31.440 
have more out of control like doing a
hand<00:04:29.470> for<00:04:29.740> example<00:04:30.250> you<00:04:30.640> need<00:04:30.790> to<00:04:30.910> have<00:04:31.030> quite

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
hand for example you need to have quite

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.260 
hand for example you need to have quite
close<00:04:31.720> control<00:04:32.020> over<00:04:32.350> each<00:04:32.470> finger<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.270> you

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
close control over each finger and you

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:36.180 
close control over each finger and you
can't<00:04:34.540> really<00:04:34.690> do<00:04:34.990> that<00:04:35.020> if<00:04:35.500> you're<00:04:35.710> using

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
can't really do that if you're using

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:41.550 
can't really do that if you're using
envelopes<00:04:36.700> I<00:04:36.880> don't<00:04:37.120> think<00:04:39.630> however<00:04:40.630> you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
envelopes I don't think however you

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.750 
envelopes I don't think however you
never<00:04:41.770> know<00:04:41.920> how<00:04:42.100> the<00:04:42.160> program<00:04:42.400> is<00:04:42.520> going<00:04:42.700> to

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
never know how the program is going to

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.850 
never know how the program is going to
change<00:04:42.940> in<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.150> future<00:04:43.200> but<00:04:44.200> this<00:04:44.440> way<00:04:44.620> way

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:44.860 
change in the future but this way way

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:47.580 
change in the future but this way way
works<00:04:45.160> really<00:04:45.400> very<00:04:45.670> very<00:04:45.730> well<00:04:46.470> and<00:04:47.470> it

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
works really very very well and it

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:48.690 
works really very very well and it
doesn't<00:04:47.830> take<00:04:47.920> very<00:04:47.950> long<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.430> once<00:04:48.580> you've

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
doesn't take very long and once you've

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:50.910 
doesn't take very long and once you've
built<00:04:48.940> it<00:04:49.150> it's<00:04:49.450> built<00:04:49.720> you<00:04:50.530> know<00:04:50.590> and<00:04:50.830> you've

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:50.920 
built it it's built you know and you've

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.260 
built it it's built you know and you've
got<00:04:51.070> that<00:04:51.190> character<00:04:51.640> forever<00:04:51.910> and<00:04:52.030> a<00:04:52.060> day<00:04:52.090> to

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
got that character forever and a day to

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.570 
got that character forever and a day to
anime<00:04:52.690> as<00:04:52.810> much<00:04:52.960> as<00:04:53.110> you<00:04:53.200> like<00:04:53.380> and<00:04:54.010> which<00:04:54.370> will

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
anime as much as you like and which will

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:05.770 
anime as much as you like and which will
be<00:04:54.700> covering<00:04:55.000> later

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:10.940 

okay<00:05:06.780> let's<00:05:07.230> just<00:05:08.750> change<00:05:09.750> change<00:05:10.620> back<00:05:10.800> to

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:10.950 
okay let's just change change back to

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:13.670 
okay let's just change change back to
object<00:05:11.040> mode<00:05:11.370> and<00:05:11.790> just<00:05:12.360> try<00:05:12.750> deforming<00:05:13.530> arm

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
object mode and just try deforming arm

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.190 
object mode and just try deforming arm
and<00:05:14.220> so<00:05:14.430> I'm<00:05:14.520> moving<00:05:14.670> grabbing<00:05:15.240> and<00:05:15.930> having<00:05:16.140> a

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
and so I'm moving grabbing and having a

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.570 
and so I'm moving grabbing and having a
look<00:05:16.350> at<00:05:16.440> how<00:05:16.560> it<00:05:16.710> looks<00:05:16.920> obviously<00:05:17.430> haven't

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
look at how it looks obviously haven't

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.130 
look at how it looks obviously haven't
got<00:05:17.730> the<00:05:17.820> eyes<00:05:17.940> on<00:05:18.180> the<00:05:18.330> caterpillar<00:05:18.810> yet<00:05:18.960> so

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:19.140 
got the eyes on the caterpillar yet so

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.000 
got the eyes on the caterpillar yet so
he<00:05:19.230> doesn't<00:05:19.470> look<00:05:19.590> quite<00:05:20.430> right<00:05:20.730> but<00:05:22.010> you

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:23.010 
he doesn't look quite right but you

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:24.920 
he doesn't look quite right but you
started<00:05:23.340> to<00:05:23.400> see<00:05:23.580> now<00:05:23.790> that<00:05:24.060> it's<00:05:24.210> deforming

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
started to see now that it's deforming

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:29.030 
started to see now that it's deforming
pretty<00:05:25.140> well<00:05:26.750> so<00:05:27.750> remember<00:05:27.930> it's<00:05:28.200> old<00:05:28.680> art

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:29.040 
pretty well so remember it's old art

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.940 
pretty well so remember it's old art
clear<00:05:29.460> rotation<00:05:30.150> old<00:05:30.780> G<00:05:31.170> to<00:05:31.230> clear<00:05:31.560> locate

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:31.950 
clear rotation old G to clear locate

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:36.920 
clear rotation old G to clear locate
location<00:05:32.700> then<00:05:33.390> a<00:05:33.740> key<00:05:34.740> selects<00:05:35.370> all<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:36.390> the

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
location then a key selects all of the

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:41.420 
location then a key selects all of the
bones<00:05:37.830> you<00:05:38.780> can<00:05:39.780> do<00:05:40.260> rotate<00:05:40.740> with<00:05:40.950> the<00:05:41.040> rotate

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:41.430 
bones you can do rotate with the rotate

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:43.130 
bones you can do rotate with the rotate
widget<00:05:41.790> the<00:05:41.940> way<00:05:42.120> I've<00:05:42.330> done<00:05:42.510> there<00:05:42.750> just<00:05:43.020> to

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:43.140 
widget the way I've done there just to

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.150 
widget the way I've done there just to
see<00:05:43.290> how<00:05:43.440> things<00:05:43.650> look<00:05:45.770> so<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.860> can<00:05:47.010> rotate

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
see how things look so you can rotate

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.810 
see how things look so you can rotate
the<00:05:48.060> head<00:05:48.240> as<00:05:48.390> well<00:05:48.510> as<00:05:48.630> great
