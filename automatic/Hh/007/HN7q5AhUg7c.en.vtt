I<00:01:44.640> barely<00:01:45.210> got<00:01:45.600> at<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.350> mock<00:01:46.530> meat<00:01:46.799> and<00:01:47.149> it

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
I barely got at the mock meat and it

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.880 
I barely got at the mock meat and it
went<00:01:48.299> up<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.600> easy<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.990> time<00:01:49.049> tried<00:01:49.680> for

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
went up pretty easy this time tried for

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.580 
went up pretty easy this time tried for
a<00:01:49.920> second<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:51.170> unnecessary<00:01:52.170> float<00:01:52.409> about

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
a second and unnecessary float about

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.760 
a second and unnecessary float about

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
syndrome I don't know I think I was just

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.370 
syndrome I don't know I think I was just
psyching<00:01:56.070> myself<00:01:56.159> out<00:01:56.520> again<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.659> ended<00:01:58.290> up

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
psyching myself out again I ended up

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.719 
psyching myself out again I ended up
instead<00:01:58.799> of<00:01:58.860> just<00:01:58.979> doing<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.340> for<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.520> ones

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
instead of just doing it for the ones

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.179 
instead of just doing it for the ones
that<00:01:59.969> I<00:02:00.000> did<00:02:00.180> three<00:02:00.570> sets<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> all<00:02:01.649> three<00:02:02.159> of

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
them pretty much had the same story the

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.810 
them pretty much had the same story the
first<00:02:04.020> rep<00:02:04.229> was<00:02:04.380> solid<00:02:04.860> felt<00:02:05.399> good<00:02:05.549> about<00:02:05.670> it

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
decided to throw in a belt for this

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.809 
decided to throw in a belt for this
third<00:02:12.819> one<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.860> I<00:02:14.860> forgot<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.400> move<00:02:15.519> my<00:02:15.670> feet

out<00:02:16.000> as<00:02:16.180> wide<00:02:16.330> as<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:16.540> wanted<00:02:16.780> them<00:02:16.900> to<00:02:17.080> and<00:02:17.110> so

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
out as wide as I wanted them to and so

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.350 
out as wide as I wanted them to and so
on<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:17.769> one<00:02:17.980> all<00:02:18.400> I'm<00:02:18.790> thinking<00:02:18.819> about<00:02:19.209> is

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
on this one all I'm thinking about is

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.600 
on this one all I'm thinking about is
trying<00:02:19.900> to<00:02:20.049> push<00:02:20.260> my<00:02:20.440> butt<00:02:20.590> back<00:02:20.830> down<00:02:20.890> trying

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
trying to push my butt back down trying

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.570 
trying to push my butt back down trying
not<00:02:21.790> to<00:02:21.970> let<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.150> lifts<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.040> just<00:02:24.040> it<00:02:24.310> seems

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:24.580 
not to let it lifts and just it seems

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.949 
not to let it lifts and just it seems
like<00:02:24.760> every<00:02:24.790> attempt<00:02:25.330> was<00:02:25.450> in<00:02:25.569> vain<00:02:25.780> because

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
like every attempt was in vain because

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:28.369 
like every attempt was in vain because
that<00:02:26.110> second<00:02:26.440> rep<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.680> but<00:02:26.860> always<00:02:27.069> came<00:02:27.400> up

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
that second rep the but always came up

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.740 
that second rep the but always came up
now<00:02:29.379> this<00:02:29.709> i<00:02:30.220> had<00:02:30.610> my<00:02:30.909> foot<00:02:31.180> my<00:02:31.390> camera

actually broke and I had to get out my
phone<00:02:33.579> and<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.120> took<00:02:34.299> me<00:02:34.329> three<00:02:34.810> hours<00:02:34.840> to<00:02:35.230> be

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530

speed pause squats and I ended up

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:49.979 
speed pause squats and I ended up
working<00:02:45.250> up<00:02:45.549> to<00:02:45.730> 495<00:02:47.010> no<00:02:48.010> belt<00:02:48.280> just<00:02:49.269> kind<00:02:49.930> of

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
working up to 495 no belt just kind of

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.809 
working up to 495 no belt just kind of
dropping<00:02:50.290> back<00:02:50.620> squats<00:02:51.010> felt<00:02:51.250> really<00:02:51.579> good

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
dropping back squats felt really good

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:53.940 
dropping back squats felt really good
after<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.599> 605<00:02:53.049> I<00:02:53.349> don't<00:02:53.680> know<00:02:53.769> I<00:02:53.799> don't

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
after the 605 I don't know I don't

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.440 
after the 605 I don't know I don't
usually<00:02:54.129> feel<00:02:54.519> this<00:02:54.670> good<00:02:54.849> afterwards<00:02:55.359> even

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
usually feel this good afterwards even

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.170 
usually feel this good afterwards even
pause<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.959> third<00:02:56.140> one<00:02:56.349> and<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:57.489> see<00:02:57.700> that<00:02:57.909> I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180 
pause the third one and you see that I

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.500 
pause the third one and you see that I
had<00:02:59.140> a<00:02:59.170> tendency<00:02:59.440> on<00:02:59.680> those<00:02:59.950> reps<00:03:00.359> because<00:03:01.359> i

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
had a tendency on those reps because i

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.789 
had a tendency on those reps because i
was<00:03:01.629> just<00:03:01.659> kind<00:03:01.840> of<00:03:01.930> relaxing<00:03:02.379> at<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.560> bottom

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
was just kind of relaxing at the bottom

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.259 
was just kind of relaxing at the bottom
to<00:03:02.920> let<00:03:03.069> my<00:03:03.190> head<00:03:03.370> come<00:03:03.579> forward<00:03:03.970> and<00:03:04.060> start

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
to let my head come forward and start

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:06.680 
to let my head come forward and start
pushing<00:03:04.450> i<00:03:04.780> wouldn't<00:03:05.319> recommend<00:03:05.379> that<00:03:05.829> but<00:03:06.250> i

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
pushing i wouldn't recommend that but i

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.910 
pushing i wouldn't recommend that but i
don't<00:03:07.690> know<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.959> wasn't<00:03:08.409> like<00:03:08.500> the<00:03:08.620> weight<00:03:08.769> was

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.130 
don't know it wasn't like the weight was
really<00:03:09.340> crushing<00:03:09.670> me<00:03:09.760> or<00:03:09.879> anything<00:03:10.060> so<00:03:10.239> I<00:03:10.690> felt

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
really crushing me or anything so I felt

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.720
