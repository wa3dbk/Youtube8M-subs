important I think everyone needs to be
introspective<00:02:02.100> innocent<00:02:02.820> realize<00:02:03.119> when<00:02:03.360> it

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
female celebrating her sexuality her

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.780 
female celebrating her sexuality her
sensuality<00:02:08.940> her<00:02:09.450> independence<00:02:10.020> or<00:02:10.320> when<00:02:11.280> when

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
does the male gaze take over you know I

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.900 
does the male gaze take over you know I
think<00:02:13.709> that's<00:02:13.920> very<00:02:14.040> very<00:02:14.190> crucial<00:02:14.489> so<00:02:14.820> I

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
think that's very very crucial so I

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.400 
think that's very very crucial so I
think<00:02:14.970> everyone<00:02:15.630> needs<00:02:15.780> to<00:02:15.930> think<00:02:16.080> about<00:02:16.320> this

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
think everyone needs to think about this

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.310 
think everyone needs to think about this
themselves<00:02:17.150> and<00:02:18.150> again<00:02:18.510> like<00:02:18.690> I<00:02:18.780> said<00:02:18.840> like

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
themselves and again like I said like

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.470 
themselves and again like I said like

what we are talking about earlier

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.400 
what we are talking about earlier
like-minded<00:02:21.480> people<00:02:21.630> can<00:02:21.870> sit<00:02:22.020> and<00:02:22.050> have<00:02:22.260> this

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
like-minded people can sit and have this

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.990 
like-minded people can sit and have this
conversation<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.130> behave<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.610> be<00:02:23.820> made

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
conversation and behave and be made

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.430 
conversation and behave and be made
aware<00:02:24.120> you<00:02:24.750> know<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.050> these<00:02:25.140> are<00:02:25.200> things

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
aware you know that these are things

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.720 
aware you know that these are things
that<00:02:25.590> we<00:02:25.800> should<00:02:25.830> should<00:02:26.250> be<00:02:26.280> careful<00:02:26.640> of

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
that we should should be careful of

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.390 
that we should should be careful of
because<00:02:26.880> I<00:02:27.209> I<00:02:27.360> do<00:02:27.630> believe<00:02:28.230> that<00:02:28.500> film<00:02:29.190> does

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
because I I do believe that film does

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.620 
because I I do believe that film does
have<00:02:29.550> an<00:02:29.640> influence<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.239> not<00:02:30.390> that<00:02:30.540> it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
have an influence it's not that it

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.449 
have an influence it's not that it
doesn't<00:02:30.750> you<00:02:31.380> know<00:02:31.500> especially<00:02:31.890> in<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.340> way

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.040 
doesn't you know especially in the way
more<00:02:32.730> than<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.000> item<00:02:33.300> song<00:02:33.480> phenomenon<00:02:33.959> I

more than the item song phenomenon I

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.229 
more than the item song phenomenon I
think<00:02:34.080> in<00:02:34.380> the<00:02:34.470> way<00:02:34.590> our<00:02:35.250> heroes<00:02:35.700> romance

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:36.239 
think in the way our heroes romance

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:38.300 
think in the way our heroes romance
harmony<00:02:37.020> I<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.860> that's<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.100> very<00:02:38.220> big

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
harmony I think that's a very big

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.710 
harmony I think that's a very big
recently<00:02:38.820> which<00:02:38.940> has<00:02:38.970> changed<00:02:39.510> over<00:02:39.630> the

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
recently which has changed over the

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.570 
recently which has changed over the
years<00:02:40.020> you<00:02:40.590> know<00:02:40.680> there<00:02:40.830> was<00:02:40.950> a<00:02:40.980> time<00:02:41.220> where<00:02:41.489> it

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
years you know there was a time where it

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.750 
years you know there was a time where it
was<00:02:41.790> very<00:02:42.860> hidden<00:02:43.860> then<00:02:44.310> it<00:02:44.430> became<00:02:44.700> very

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
was very hidden then it became very

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.940 
was very hidden then it became very
sincere<00:02:45.630> and<00:02:45.660> romantic<00:02:46.290> and<00:02:46.410> then<00:02:46.590> moving<00:02:46.769> and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
sincere and romantic and then moving and

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.130 
sincere and romantic and then moving and
now<00:02:47.010> it's<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.370> gone<00:02:47.610> into<00:02:47.910> a<00:02:47.940> phase<00:02:48.570> I<00:02:48.840> feel

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
now it's it's gone into a phase I feel

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.870 
now it's it's gone into a phase I feel
for<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:49.950> most<00:02:50.130> of<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.489> course<00:02:50.519> they<00:02:50.790> know
