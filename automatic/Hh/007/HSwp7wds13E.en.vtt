will this guitar came with EMGs think 81
+<00:01:11.939> 60<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> believe<00:01:12.750> MGS<00:01:13.500> it<00:01:14.250> had<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.549> nickel

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
+ 60 I believe MGS it had the nickel

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.859 
+ 60 I believe MGS it had the nickel
knobs<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.549> had<00:01:17.759> the<00:01:19.610> canonized<00:01:20.869> tuner

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
knobs and it had the canonized tuner

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.990 
knobs and it had the canonized tuner
buttons<00:01:22.200> up<00:01:22.619> here<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.549> kind<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.820> hard<00:01:23.970> to

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
buttons up here it's kind of hard to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.480 
buttons up here it's kind of hard to
tell<00:01:24.150> they<00:01:24.299> almost<00:01:24.420> look<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> same<00:01:25.020> but<00:01:26.009> I<00:01:26.220> had

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
tell they almost look the same but I had

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.149

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
modifications as you can see the knobs I

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.390 
modifications as you can see the knobs I
went<00:02:20.670> with<00:02:20.819> the<00:02:20.970> Gibson<00:02:21.480> Bell<00:02:21.959> style<00:02:22.470> knobs

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
these are amber kind of hard to tell but

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.710 
these are amber kind of hard to tell but
to<00:02:26.069> match<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.519> body<00:02:28.280> I<00:02:29.280> also<00:02:29.700> switched<00:02:30.330> out

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
to match the body I also switched out

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.460 
to match the body I also switched out
the<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:31.260> pots<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:32.000> potentiometers<00:02:33.000> there

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
the the pots the potentiometers there

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.300 
the the pots the potentiometers there
inside<00:02:34.470> the<00:02:34.680> guitar<00:02:34.830> itself<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.700> put<00:02:36.420> in<00:02:36.569> cts

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 
inside the guitar itself I put in cts

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:40.850 
inside the guitar itself I put in cts
500k<00:02:38.310> pots<00:02:38.959> as<00:02:39.959> opposed<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.590> was<00:02:40.709> in

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
500k pots as opposed to what was in

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.059 
500k pots as opposed to what was in
there<00:02:41.040> before<00:02:41.459> which<00:02:41.819> I<00:02:42.090> guess<00:02:42.269> weren't<00:02:42.630> bad

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
there before which I guess weren't bad

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.339 
there before which I guess weren't bad
but<00:02:44.069> these<00:02:44.250> you<00:02:44.640> know<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:45.450> an<00:02:45.660> upgrade

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
but these you know it's an upgrade

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:51.229 
but these you know it's an upgrade
I<00:02:46.380> also<00:02:47.190> changed<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.329> switch<00:02:49.170> tip<00:02:50.040> here<00:02:50.579> the

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
I also changed the switch tip here the

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.710 
I also changed the switch tip here the
3-way<00:02:51.630> switch<00:02:52.049> selector<00:02:52.560> tip<00:02:53.030> before<00:02:54.030> it<00:02:54.569> was

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
3-way switch selector tip before it was

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.069 
3-way switch selector tip before it was
I<00:02:54.870> guess<00:02:55.049> an<00:02:55.200> amber<00:02:55.680> tip<00:02:56.269> but<00:02:57.269> it<00:02:57.569> looked<00:02:57.840> like

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
I guess an amber tip but it looked like

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:01.100 
I guess an amber tip but it looked like
some<00:02:58.560> orange<00:02:58.890> crap<00:02:59.700> to<00:02:59.970> me<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.150> didn't<00:03:00.720> like<00:03:00.900> it

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
some orange crap to me I didn't like it

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:03.470 
some orange crap to me I didn't like it
the<00:03:01.650> whole<00:03:01.829> guitar<00:03:02.069> initially<00:03:03.060> when<00:03:03.209> you<00:03:03.299> buy

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480

the whole guitar initially when you buy
it<00:03:03.540> to<00:03:03.870> me<00:03:04.019> it<00:03:04.140> looks<00:03:04.349> like<00:03:04.440> a<00:03:04.709> mongrel<00:03:05.280> because

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:06.150 
it to me it looks like a mongrel because

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.539 
it to me it looks like a mongrel because
you<00:03:06.269> have<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.079> EMG<00:03:07.590> s<00:03:07.890> which<00:03:08.190> are<00:03:08.340> kind<00:03:08.489> of

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
you have the EMG s which are kind of

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:12.680 
you have the EMG s which are kind of
like<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.730> matte<00:03:09.560> black<00:03:10.560> and<00:03:11.299> then<00:03:12.299> you<00:03:12.450> have<00:03:12.660> a

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
like a matte black and then you have a

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.099 
like a matte black and then you have a
orange<00:03:13.410> tip<00:03:14.160> then<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:15.180> nickel<00:03:15.690> knobs
