00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
I'm a little went a later video how this

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.660 
I'm a little went a later video how this
actually<00:00:13.769> works<00:00:14.179> so<00:00:16.039> it's<00:00:17.039> actually<00:00:17.369> really

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
actually works so it's actually really

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.050 
actually works so it's actually really
simple<00:00:18.949> react<00:00:19.949> i<00:00:20.160> said<00:00:20.490> something<00:00:20.699> like

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:23.060 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.769 

lasers<00:00:24.170> and<00:00:25.880> reflectors<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:26.910> stuff<00:00:27.570> like

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
lasers and reflectors and stuff like

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.650 
lasers and reflectors and stuff like
that<00:00:29.090> but<00:00:30.090> no<00:00:30.269> it's<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.900> darn<00:00:31.170> simple<00:00:32.660> you

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
that but no it's really darn simple you

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.790 
that but no it's really darn simple you
got<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> envy<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.350> guy<00:00:34.559> who<00:00:34.620> who<00:00:35.579> made<00:00:35.790> this<00:00:36.800> so

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
got to envy the guy who who made this so

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.810 
got to envy the guy who who made this so
you<00:00:37.890> got<00:00:38.160> the<00:00:39.800> little<00:00:40.800> propeller<00:00:41.250> which<00:00:41.610> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
you got the little propeller which is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.900 
you got the little propeller which is
nothing<00:00:42.000> but<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:43.710> same<00:00:43.890> material<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.700> use

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
nothing but the same material you use

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.069 
nothing but the same material you use
for<00:00:45.120> book<00:00:45.329> covers<00:00:45.719> once<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> other<00:00:47.309> side

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:48.079 
for book covers once I on the other side

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.930 
for book covers once I on the other side
embedded<00:00:49.079> inside<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.829> little<00:00:50.719> LED<00:00:51.719> chip<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.430> I

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
embedded inside is little LED chip and I

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.639 
embedded inside is little LED chip and I
don't<00:00:54.120> know<00:00:54.180> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.390> can<00:00:54.539> see<00:00:54.780> this<00:00:54.960> but<00:00:55.320> there

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
don't know if you can see this but there

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.709 
don't know if you can see this but there
are<00:00:56.010> one<00:00:56.430> two<00:00:56.460> three<00:00:56.879> four<00:00:57.149> five<00:00:57.329> six<00:00:57.510> seven

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
are one two three four five six seven

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.700 
are one two three four five six seven
eight<00:00:57.930> leds<00:00:58.199> are<00:00:58.800> nine<00:00:59.010> LEDs<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.030> and

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:00.710 
eight leds are nine LEDs on here and

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.250 
eight leds are nine LEDs on here and
each<00:01:01.710> one<00:01:02.070> is<00:01:02.309> shorter<00:01:03.149> than<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.480> other<00:01:03.510> and

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.260 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.899 

that's<00:01:07.260> really<00:01:07.500> all<00:01:07.650> it's<00:01:08.100> the<00:01:08.189> same<00:01:08.490> effect

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
that's really all it's the same effect

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.700 
that's really all it's the same effect
if<00:01:09.060> you<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.360> like<00:01:09.540> a<00:01:09.570> flashlight<00:01:09.960> and<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
if you have like a flashlight and you

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.190 
if you have like a flashlight and you
squirrel<00:01:11.220> it<00:01:11.340> around<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:12.720> looks<00:01:12.960> like<00:01:13.170> a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
squirrel it around it looks like a

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.859 
squirrel it around it looks like a
stream<00:01:15.320> stream<00:01:16.320> of<00:01:16.470> light<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:17.570> it's<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> same

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
stream stream of light and it's the same

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.679 
stream stream of light and it's the same
effect<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:20.070> have<00:01:20.220> little<00:01:20.640> lines<00:01:20.909> of<00:01:21.240> light<00:01:21.420> in

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
effect you have little lines of light in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.140 
effect you have little lines of light in
this<00:01:21.869> case

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
this case

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.930 

and<00:01:25.220> the<00:01:26.220> little<00:01:26.400> chip<00:01:26.730> inside<00:01:28.310> blinks<00:01:29.310> and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
and the little chip inside blinks and

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.990 
and the little chip inside blinks and
exactly<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.540> right<00:01:30.720> moment<00:01:31.310> so<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.580> looks

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
exactly the right moment so that looks

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.790 
exactly the right moment so that looks
like<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.270> statie<00:01:33.630> letter<00:01:36.440> it's<00:01:37.440> synchronized

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:37.800 
like a statie letter it's synchronized

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:43.370 
like a statie letter it's synchronized
with<00:01:38.250> the<00:01:38.700> turning<00:01:39.270> so<00:01:41.450> it<00:01:42.450> will<00:01:42.600> just<00:01:42.630> go<00:01:43.140> on

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
with the turning so it will just go on

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.290 
with the turning so it will just go on
when<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.740> propeller<00:01:44.070> is<00:01:44.250> exactly<00:01:44.850> like<00:01:44.940> right

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:45.300 
when the propeller is exactly like right

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:50.630 
when the propeller is exactly like right
here<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:46.670> I<00:01:48.710> think<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:49.830> can<00:01:49.980> turn<00:01:50.190> off<00:01:50.400> when

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
here and I think you can turn off when

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.480 
here and I think you can turn off when
it<00:01:50.790> goes<00:01:50.940> around<00:01:51.090> again<00:01:51.600> and<00:01:51.980> that's<00:01:52.980> so<00:01:53.160> fast

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
it goes around again and that's so fast

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.270 
it goes around again and that's so fast
that<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.760> think<00:01:54.090> it's<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.360> static<00:01:55.280> mystery

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
that you think it's a static mystery

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.430 
that you think it's a static mystery
white<00:01:56.610> what's<00:01:57.420> really<00:01:57.690> that's<00:01:57.869> all<00:01:58.050> to<00:01:58.290> it

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.130 

so<00:02:02.650> yeah<00:02:03.700> so<00:02:04.700> much<00:02:04.880> to<00:02:05.180> the<00:02:05.330> explanation<00:02:05.930> on

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
so yeah so much to the explanation on

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.540 
so yeah so much to the explanation on
this<00:02:06.950> wonder<00:02:07.430> of<00:02:07.660> gimmicks<00:02:11.170> and<00:02:12.170> now<00:02:12.650> to<00:02:12.710> other

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
this wonder of gimmicks and now to other

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:20.440 
this wonder of gimmicks and now to other
topics<00:02:16.180> so<00:02:18.130> what<00:02:19.130> did<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.460> want<00:02:19.670> to<00:02:19.790> say<00:02:20.120> I

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
topics so what did that want to say I

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.890 
topics so what did that want to say I
don't<00:02:21.350> like<00:02:21.830> the<00:02:22.130> distortion<00:02:22.880> in<00:02:23.060> this<00:02:23.300> 16<00:02:23.780> to

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
don't like the distortion in this 16 to

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.310 
don't like the distortion in this 16 to
19<00:02:24.110> yeah<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> don't<00:02:24.950> know<00:02:25.100> what<00:02:25.280> this<00:02:25.430> for<00:02:26.060> you
