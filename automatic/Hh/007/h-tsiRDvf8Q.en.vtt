it is called Lil Fishys and I got it at Toys R Us toys

00:00:18.139 --> 00:00:23.579
it was 8 or 10 dollars  there are 10 different varieties of Lil Fishys

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.320
tiger shark whale  one that looks like Nemo  all kinds of different fish

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.720
this one is a hammer head shark

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:38.580
you twist off the head and you need a tiny Phillips head

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:47.000
screwdriver available before you try to assemble this and insert the batteries 
or you can't get the batteries in it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
put the head on and when you turn it

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
there is a little  tiny motor

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
that goes in his tail

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
there are three different settings or positions

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
to put his tail

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
so you can make

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it do different swimming tricks

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Lil Fishys are just adorable

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I am going to put it in the water

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
let you see some of the tricks the Lil Fishys can do

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
it is entertaining

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
everyone around here

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
when the tail is completely up

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.619
these are some of the tricks he does

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.019
when the tail is pointed completely upwards

00:01:32.019 --> 00:01:38.139
here he is with his tail  in
the middle position

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.520
you can see compared to the way his tail is

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520
he does different tricks

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.160
the tail is in the  flat position now and he's zooming  everywhere

00:01:52.160 --> 00:02:05.220
sometimes being prepared is finding a
way to keep your little grandchildren

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:12.830
entertained on a rainy afternoon or
when they need a bath so this Lil Fishys toy is the greatest

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.590
look for these little motorized water
robot fish at Toys R Us they probably have them other

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.680
places but that's where I found it and you
can see all the different varieties they have

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.960
I think Lil Fishys is  a fabulous robot fish battery toy and 
 we've enjoyed it a lot one  thing

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:34.340
we do though is we take it open and dry
it out make sure that it's dried after

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.870
we're done using it to make sure that the
batteries do not corrode set them out to dry and you can have

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.090
hours of fun with
Lil Fishys  he's a lot of fun let me know what

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.170
you think about the Lil Fishys

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.170
