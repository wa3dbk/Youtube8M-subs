I've<00:02:01.380> been<00:02:01.410> on<00:02:01.620> many<00:02:02.070> teams<00:02:02.370> in<00:02:02.520> this<00:02:02.640> league

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
I've been on many teams in this league

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
I've been on many teams in this league
and<00:02:03.180> it's<00:02:04.020> just<00:02:04.220> nothing's<00:02:05.220> been<00:02:05.370> better<00:02:05.520> than

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
and it's just nothing's been better than

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.289 
and it's just nothing's been better than
this

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:07.299 
this

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.749 
this
and<00:02:07.600> hopefully<00:02:08.080> hopefully<00:02:09.069> we<00:02:09.399> can<00:02:09.490> keep<00:02:09.640> it

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
and hopefully hopefully we can keep it

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.100 
and hopefully hopefully we can keep it
together<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.209> they<00:02:10.330> can<00:02:10.509> make<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.660> nice<00:02:10.869> long

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
together and they can make a nice long

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:19.030 
together and they can make a nice long
run<00:02:11.260> out<00:02:11.440> of<00:02:11.500> this

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.179 

I<00:02:20.140> think<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.230> best<00:02:21.409> thing<00:02:21.650> will<00:02:21.799> be<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.040> win<00:02:22.159> a

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:22.189 
I think the best thing will be to win a

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:23.709 
I think the best thing will be to win a
championship<00:02:22.430> there<00:02:23.120> and<00:02:23.269> the<00:02:23.359> hang<00:02:23.510> those
