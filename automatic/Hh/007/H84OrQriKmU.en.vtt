00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:05.810
 again with a video tutorial for 

00:00:04.189 --> 00:00:07.840
 help them in the use of yours 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.860
 electrical installation 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.960
 As you can see in the picture that we show today 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.880
 you have the differential switch that is 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.230
 this one of the lever which in turn has a 

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:22.550
 little yellow button in this case 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.099
 a thermal magnet for a circuit 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:27.599
 enemy and magnetothermic these are for 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.060
 different circuits of our 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.309
 installation in this case are about 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.000
 different heating circuits 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.710
 electric 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:42.520
 but well what we are going to today is to use 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.309
 of the differential the differential all that 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.820
 have you ever heard that it is good 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:53.040
 than wait for him to make him jump once to 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.829
 Month we do this by pressing the button 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.769
 what do we think 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.739
 simulate a fault and check the 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:06.320
 differential is in good use and we are 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.930
 really protecting against a threat 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:13.770
 we must as we should act as good 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:16.969
 we simply press the button we see 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.969
 the light is fired 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.789
 we raise and we recover again with 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:27.850
 we have simulated a breakdown before the 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:30.850
 which protects said differential and 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:34.719
 we check that it is in good condition that 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.569
 by acting in this way he does not shoot 

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.819
 we see that it is in poor condition and what 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:40.770
 we have then as an ornament with which 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:42.689
 we have 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.650
 and call our installer and 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.690
 replace it 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:50.160
 if we are going to be safe and having 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.160
 a correct installation 

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.660
 do not forget once a month we press the 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.320
 differential button and we check your 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.010
 functioning 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.010
 until next time
