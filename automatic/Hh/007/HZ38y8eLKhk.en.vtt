00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
you play if you pick it up maybe once or

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.530 
you play if you pick it up maybe once or
twice<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:41.010> week<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.430> so<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.670> could<00:00:42.030> probably<00:00:42.180> go

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
twice a week or so you could probably go

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.180 
twice a week or so you could probably go
a<00:00:42.570> little<00:00:42.870> bit<00:00:42.989> longer<00:00:43.200> maybe<00:00:43.530> even<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.160> a

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
a little bit longer maybe even up to a

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.160 
a little bit longer maybe even up to a
month<00:00:44.460> but<00:00:44.820> I'd<00:00:45.270> say<00:00:45.480> after<00:00:45.600> a<00:00:45.750> month<00:00:45.989> you

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
month but I'd say after a month you

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.299 
month but I'd say after a month you
should<00:00:46.350> definitely<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.829> your<00:00:47.039> strings

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309

there and we've got quite a bit of
excess<00:04:06.690> string<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.500> I'm<00:04:07.890> gonna<00:04:08.070> go<00:04:08.310> ahead<00:04:08.340> and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
excess string so I'm gonna go ahead and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.640 
excess string so I'm gonna go ahead and
I'm<00:04:09.000> gonna<00:04:09.210> clip<00:04:09.540> that<00:04:09.720> excess<00:04:10.170> off

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.360 
there's no need to have that in the way

00:05:34.010 --> 00:05:34.020 
then my thumb is actually pulling on the

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.630 
then my thumb is actually pulling on the
rest<00:05:34.260> of<00:05:34.380> the<00:05:34.500> string<00:05:34.800> to<00:05:35.040> allow<00:05:35.250> the<00:05:35.310> bridge

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:35.640 
rest of the string to allow the bridge

00:05:35.640 --> 00:06:01.170 
rest of the string to allow the bridge
to<00:05:35.910> stay<00:05:36.120> in<00:05:36.270> place

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:01.180 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.790 

all<00:06:02.180> right<00:06:02.389> well<00:06:02.780> the<00:06:02.930> strings<00:06:03.199> are<00:06:03.380> on<00:06:03.500> it<00:06:03.680> and

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:03.800 
all right well the strings are on it and

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.730 
all right well the strings are on it and
now<00:06:04.070> we're<00:06:04.250> ready<00:06:04.460> to<00:06:04.550> tune<00:06:05.060> it<00:06:05.210> to<00:06:05.330> pitch<00:06:05.740> the

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
now we're ready to tune it to pitch the

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.250 
now we're ready to tune it to pitch the
first<00:06:06.979> thing<00:06:07.190> I<00:06:07.340> do<00:06:07.400> is<00:06:07.910> I<00:06:08.419> tune<00:06:08.750> the<00:06:08.930> lowest

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:09.260 
first thing I do is I tune the lowest

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.740 
first thing I do is I tune the lowest
string<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.860> low<00:06:10.010> E<00:06:10.250> all<00:06:10.550> the<00:06:10.790> way<00:06:10.910> up<00:06:11.090> to<00:06:11.240> pitch

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:11.750 
string the low E all the way up to pitch

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:13.270 
string the low E all the way up to pitch
and<00:06:11.930> I<00:06:12.020> just<00:06:12.139> then<00:06:12.410> I<00:06:12.440> continue<00:06:13.010> with<00:06:13.130> the<00:06:13.250> a

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
and I just then I continue with the a

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.980 
and I just then I continue with the a
and<00:06:13.820> then<00:06:14.210> the<00:06:14.330> D<00:06:14.510> the<00:06:14.780> G<00:06:14.990> the<00:06:15.380> B<00:06:15.410> in<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:15.800> E<00:06:15.830> and

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
and then the D the G the B in the E and

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.330 
and then the D the G the B in the E and
after<00:06:17.990> those<00:06:18.139> have<00:06:18.350> been<00:06:18.440> tuned<00:06:18.740> then<00:06:19.010> we<00:06:19.160> go

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:19.340 
after those have been tuned then we go

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.670 
after those have been tuned then we go
back<00:06:19.639> to<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.030> low<00:06:20.180> E<00:06:20.419> and<00:06:20.780> then<00:06:21.110> we<00:06:21.229> start<00:06:21.560> to

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:21.680 
back to the low E and then we start to

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.129 
back to the low E and then we start to
stretch<00:06:21.979> out<00:06:22.250> the<00:06:22.280> string<00:06:22.760> and<00:06:23.000> that's<00:06:23.870> going

00:06:24.129 --> 00:06:24.139 
stretch out the string and that's going

00:06:24.139 --> 00:06:26.740 
stretch out the string and that's going
to<00:06:24.290> allow<00:06:24.410> the<00:06:24.470> string<00:06:24.919> to<00:06:25.430> wrap<00:06:25.460> more<00:06:26.389> tightly

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:26.750 
to allow the string to wrap more tightly

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.920 
to allow the string to wrap more tightly
around<00:06:27.229> the<00:06:27.880> tuning<00:06:28.880> head<00:06:29.090> and<00:06:29.330> it's<00:06:29.750> also

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:29.930 
around the tuning head and it's also

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:31.990 
around the tuning head and it's also
going<00:06:30.110> to<00:06:30.169> allow<00:06:30.290> the<00:06:30.470> string<00:06:30.979> to<00:06:31.340> sit<00:06:31.580> much

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.000 
going to allow the string to sit much

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.629 
going to allow the string to sit much
better<00:06:32.360> into<00:06:32.720> the<00:06:32.840> bridge<00:06:33.310> so<00:06:34.310> I'm<00:06:34.460> going<00:06:34.610> to

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
better into the bridge so I'm going to

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.270 
better into the bridge so I'm going to
do<00:06:34.820> that<00:06:35.000> again<00:06:35.150> and<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:36.290> may<00:06:36.500> even<00:06:36.650> repeat<00:06:37.160> it

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.280 
do that again and I may even repeat it

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.770 
do that again and I may even repeat it
two<00:06:37.490> or<00:06:37.639> three<00:06:37.820> more<00:06:37.970> times<00:06:38.210> just<00:06:38.450> to<00:06:38.750> make

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:38.780 
two or three more times just to make

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.200 
two or three more times just to make
sure<00:06:39.080> I<00:06:39.110> get<00:06:39.290> perfectly<00:06:40.220> stable<00:06:40.490> tuning<00:06:41.000> and

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210
