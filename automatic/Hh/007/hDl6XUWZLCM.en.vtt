I<00:00:19.050> was<00:00:19.230> really<00:00:19.439> surprised<00:00:19.830> because<00:00:19.980> I

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
I was really surprised because I

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.820 
I was really surprised because I
expected<00:00:20.789> like<00:00:21.000> hordes<00:00:21.689> of<00:00:21.810> people<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.500> be<00:00:22.650> at

expected like hordes of people to be at

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.710 
expected like hordes of people to be at
Goodwill<00:00:23.310> because<00:00:23.699> normally<00:00:24.150> under<00:00:24.390> fifty

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
Goodwill because normally under fifty

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.480 
Goodwill because normally under fifty
percent<00:00:24.990> off<00:00:25.170> days<00:00:25.380> there's<00:00:25.680> just<00:00:25.949> so<00:00:26.369> many

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
percent off days there's just so many

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.060

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
or winter and I mean I think it's just

weird<00:04:08.390> that<00:04:08.540> I<00:04:08.840> found<00:04:09.200> the<00:04:09.319> exact<00:04:09.680> same<00:04:09.920> shirt

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
weird that I found the exact same shirt

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:12.820 
weird that I found the exact same shirt
in<00:04:10.489> two<00:04:11.239> different<00:04:11.420> colors<00:04:11.930> so<00:04:11.959> I<00:04:12.290> guess<00:04:12.650> the

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 
in two different colors so I guess the

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.979 
in two different colors so I guess the
person<00:04:13.010> who<00:04:13.280> donated<00:04:13.700> them<00:04:14.000> had<00:04:14.629> them<00:04:14.840> in<00:04:14.959> the

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:14.989 
person who donated them had them in the

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:16.420 
person who donated them had them in the
same<00:04:15.230> colors<00:04:15.560> or<00:04:15.739> maybe<00:04:15.920> it's<00:04:16.040> just<00:04:16.070> a<00:04:16.250> like<00:04:16.400> a
