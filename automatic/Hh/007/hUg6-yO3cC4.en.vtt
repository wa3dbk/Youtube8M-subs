00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.440
 Yes 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:12.900
 One feels bad 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.900
 Today is January 2 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.990
 I have also drunk considerably 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.980
 Because it is a character 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.980
 I will bake it 

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.570

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.680
 Two eyes 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.680
 Yes good 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:36.930
 Everyone is as drunk as anyone but this is a barbecue alone 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.930
 Whoever Ever's Sakura 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:42.550
 This room 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.550
 Already almost empty 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.620
 American beef rose meat 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:56.020
 580250 yen 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.020
 Lettuce in had torn this ahead 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.360
 There is a lot of smoke 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.649
 Because not get Kama' to family 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:10.649
 Barbeki in the street 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.860
 I want to talk about something 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.860
 I want to get angry but 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:25.740
 You have me to hear people 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.740
 The whole monologue say dancing blue 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 Try to eat or jar 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.929
 It is too Muraki 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.929
 this 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.640
 It is very difficult to use chopsticks while taking a camera 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.640
 Good 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.740
 I 'll put it on ... I 'm I 'm I 'm I 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.070
 Great memory 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.090
 Some old establishment 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.539
 I I I I we 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.539
 I will eat 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.620
 It was a song 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:03.360
 Hey 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.360
 I can't make it 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.010
 Put in 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.470
 Maybe this person from now 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.890
 Put it on youtube 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.100
 put on mixi 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.090
 I just wonder who was watching me 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.760
 Take a look at this coffee acceleration one this 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.720
 This is this one 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:32.060
 This charcoal 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.060
 Say and wanted to put between the driver and this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.180
 This was the next one 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.940
 What 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.750
 The to wave 108 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 So I think that this seven wheel is something but it will actually be 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.840
 It attacks the whole of this Ueki-cho Saki method 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.960
 This rainproof 50 9 volume flower pot 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.720
 Under the Ueki pot 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:03:00.860
 And just in case within the Oh over this 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.820
 I 'm kind of open to Akoko, but I ca n't get water out of the Takamizu wiki. 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.820
 Hey down from the hole 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.590
 If the charcoal falls 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.980
 There is also a newspaper. 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:13.470
 I will do this 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.700
 Bread plate This is Mr. Ren, please ask for this line 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.960

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.069
 The guy I just baked before 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.490
 I will eat 

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:26.200
 I'm going to order a little pepper over a long time before eating 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:30.180
 It can not be written as sexual activity while taking this camera 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.180
 If worth before 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.600
 This is another dinner 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:39.819
 I eat as I thought to say that I 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.460
 But this 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.600
 See this 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.850
 Wow 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.210
 Now 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.210

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:56.020
 I still 

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.290
 I'm going to go if it gets awful and lonely 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:00.099
 Then 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:00.099
 Finish drinking beer 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.220
