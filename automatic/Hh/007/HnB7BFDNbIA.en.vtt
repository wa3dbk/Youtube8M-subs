00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
the real-life couple and Lorraine Warren

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.380 
the real-life couple and Lorraine Warren
who<00:02:43.840> investigated<00:02:44.530> paranormal<00:02:45.390> activities

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
who investigated paranormal activities

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.690 
who investigated paranormal activities
and<00:02:46.690> most<00:02:47.500> famously<00:02:47.830> did<00:02:48.040> the<00:02:48.160> amityville

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and most famously did the amityville

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.580 
and most famously did the amityville
case<00:02:49.090> but<00:02:49.540> I<00:02:49.569> don't<00:02:50.110> think<00:02:50.260> that's<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.440> one

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
case but I don't think that's the one

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.699 
case but I don't think that's the one
they're<00:02:50.709> exploring<00:02:50.980> here<00:02:51.370> but<00:02:51.970> uh<00:02:52.380> on<00:02:53.380> that

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:53.709 
they're exploring here but uh on that

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:55.080 
they're exploring here but uh on that
note<00:02:53.860> though<00:02:54.040> I<00:02:54.069> think<00:02:54.190> it<00:02:54.400> hurts<00:02:54.610> the<00:02:54.730> trailer

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
note though I think it hurts the trailer

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.070 
note though I think it hurts the trailer
a<00:02:55.120> little<00:02:55.390> bit<00:02:55.510> because<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:55.810> think<00:02:55.870> that

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
a little bit because I think that

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.530 
a little bit because I think that
Patrick<00:02:56.830> Wilson<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.430> vera<00:02:57.760> for<00:02:57.940> Mia<00:02:58.120> are<00:02:58.299> so

00:02:58.530 --> 00:02:58.540 
Patrick Wilson and vera for Mia are so

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:00.630 
Patrick Wilson and vera for Mia are so
miscast<00:02:59.080> first<00:03:00.040> of<00:03:00.130> all<00:03:00.190> they<00:03:00.280> looked<00:03:00.459> nothing

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
miscast first of all they looked nothing

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.180 
miscast first of all they looked nothing
like<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.540> Lorraine<00:03:01.810> Warren<00:03:02.110> did<00:03:02.950> in<00:03:03.010> real

the<00:04:27.310> Warrens<00:04:27.610> are<00:04:27.729> miscast<00:04:28.120> but<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.750> really<00:04:29.260> a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
the Warrens are miscast but I really a

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.409 
the Warrens are miscast but I really a
kind<00:04:29.950> like<00:04:30.340> I<00:04:30.520> like<00:04:30.729> everything<00:04:31.000> else<00:04:31.270> around

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
kind like I like everything else around

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:33.000 
kind like I like everything else around

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
them and I you know and I think that

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.710 
them and I you know and I think that
looks<00:04:33.190> like<00:04:33.310> the<00:04:33.430> actors<00:04:33.700> are<00:04:33.789> both<00:04:33.940> game<00:04:34.210> so

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:34.720 
looks like the actors are both game so

cullen and that's that's really a very

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:48.900 
cullen and that's that's really a very
clever<00:04:47.650> bit<00:04:47.919> of<00:04:48.010> casting<00:04:48.190> it's<00:04:48.550> hard<00:04:48.700> to<00:04:48.790> do

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
clever bit of casting it's hard to do

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.060 
clever bit of casting it's hard to do
stuff<00:04:49.180> stuff<00:04:49.840> with<00:04:49.990> child<00:04:50.260> roles<00:04:50.590> because

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
stuff stuff with child roles because

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:52.620 
stuff stuff with child roles because
there<00:04:51.550> aren't<00:04:51.669> a<00:04:51.730> lot<00:04:51.760> of<00:04:51.880> well-known<00:04:52.180> child

there aren't a lot of well-known child

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:54.990 
there aren't a lot of well-known child
actors<00:04:53.050> but<00:04:53.560> I<00:04:53.620> think<00:04:53.950> it<00:04:54.040> was<00:04:54.130> very<00:04:54.250> clever<00:04:54.669> to

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
actors but I think it was very clever to

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.820 
actors but I think it was very clever to
cast<00:04:55.360> these<00:04:55.570> daughters<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.260> way<00:04:56.440> and<00:04:56.650> you

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:56.830 
cast these daughters that way and you

00:04:56.830 --> 00:04:59.250 
cast these daughters that way and you
know<00:04:57.010> that<00:04:57.160> every<00:04:57.700> every<00:04:58.480> extra<00:04:58.780> person<00:04:59.169> you

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
know that every every extra person you

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.690 
know that every every extra person you
might<00:04:59.350> bring<00:04:59.560> into<00:04:59.740> the<00:04:59.830> theater<00:05:00.100> helps<00:05:00.400> so

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
might bring into the theater helps so

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.510 
might bring into the theater helps so
again<00:05:01.240> very<00:05:01.450> smart<00:05:02.350> very<00:05:02.380> shrewdly<00:05:02.889> made<00:05:03.220> film

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
again very smart very shrewdly made film

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.300 
again very smart very shrewdly made film
and<00:05:04.200> when<00:05:05.200> some<00:05:05.380> people<00:05:05.800> are<00:05:05.889> this<00:05:06.040> on<00:05:06.220> the

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
and when some people are this on the

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.129 
and when some people are this on the
ball<00:05:06.460> business-wise<00:05:07.000> I<00:05:07.300> think<00:05:07.810> it's<00:05:07.960> a<00:05:08.020> good

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
ball business-wise I think it's a good

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.930 
ball business-wise I think it's a good
bet<00:05:08.320> they're<00:05:08.500> on<00:05:08.590> the<00:05:08.680> ball<00:05:08.830> creative<00:05:09.400> wise<00:05:09.550> so

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
bet they're on the ball creative wise so

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.890 
bet they're on the ball creative wise so
