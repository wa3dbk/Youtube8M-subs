00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
into Sagittarius which adds enthusiasm

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.480 
into Sagittarius which adds enthusiasm
to<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.689> mind<00:01:40.020> but<00:01:40.259> traditional<00:01:40.829> astrology

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to the mind but traditional astrology

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.429 
to the mind but traditional astrology
didn't<00:01:41.790> like<00:01:41.970> mercury<00:01:42.299> and<00:01:42.630> Sagittarius

didn't like mercury and Sagittarius

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.520 
didn't like mercury and Sagittarius
because<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.369> detail<00:01:45.090> oriented<00:01:45.570> planet<00:01:46.380> is

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
because this detail oriented planet is

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.460 
because this detail oriented planet is
too<00:01:46.799> busy<00:01:47.280> looking<00:01:47.880> over<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.479> horizon<00:01:49.140> to

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
too busy looking over the horizon to

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.260 
too busy looking over the horizon to
take<00:01:49.680> care<00:01:49.860> of<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> business<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.759> what's

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
take care of the business of what's

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.569 
take care of the business of what's
going<00:01:51.479> on<00:01:51.750> right<00:01:51.899> here<00:01:52.079> and<00:01:52.560> now<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.979> I<00:01:53.310> think

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
going on right here and now and I think

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.609 
going on right here and now and I think
part<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.240> problem<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.020> month<00:01:55.229> can<00:01:55.590> be

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
part of the problem of the month can be

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.580 
part of the problem of the month can be
this<00:01:56.369> upbeat<00:01:56.899> Sagittarian<00:01:57.899> energy<00:01:58.320> and<00:01:58.500> the

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
this upbeat Sagittarian energy and the

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.590 
this upbeat Sagittarian energy and the
mercury<00:01:59.040> looking<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.579> all<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.880> good<00:02:00.090> news<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
mercury looking at all the good news and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.810 
mercury looking at all the good news and
meanwhile<00:02:01.380> I<00:02:01.680> think<00:02:01.979> one<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.399> key<00:02:02.610> players

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
meanwhile I think one of the key players

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.260 
meanwhile I think one of the key players
this<00:02:03.360> month<00:02:03.689> is<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.380> planet<00:02:04.770> Venus<00:02:04.969> which<00:02:05.969> all

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
this month is the planet Venus which all

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
this month is the planet Venus which all
month<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.869> slowing<00:02:07.500> down<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.759> begins<00:02:09.179> its

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
month is slowing down then it begins its

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.380 
month is slowing down then it begins its
retrograde<00:02:10.200> phase<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.220> December<00:02:12.209> 21st

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
retrograde phase on December 21st

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
retrograde phase on December 21st
first<00:02:13.540> and<00:02:14.140> what<00:02:14.380> that<00:02:14.410> means<00:02:14.860> is<00:02:15.160> that

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
first and what that means is that

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:17.640 
first and what that means is that
because<00:02:15.819> Venus<00:02:16.390> is<00:02:16.750> moving<00:02:17.170> from<00:02:17.319> Earth's

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
because Venus is moving from Earth's

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.440 
because Venus is moving from Earth's
point<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.160> view<00:02:18.310> slower<00:02:18.760> than<00:02:19.090> it<00:02:19.150> normally

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
point of view slower than it normally

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.440 
point of view slower than it normally
moves<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.560> has<00:02:20.980> more<00:02:21.190> gravity<00:02:21.880> more<00:02:22.150> weight

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
moves it has more gravity more weight

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.350 
moves it has more gravity more weight
and<00:02:22.750> on<00:02:23.170> top<00:02:23.440> of<00:02:23.500> that<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:24.340> in<00:02:24.640> it's<00:02:25.150> in

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
and on top of that it's in it's in

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.930 
and on top of that it's in it's in
Capricorn<00:02:26.020> and<00:02:26.140> Venus<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:26.980> Capricorn<00:02:27.010> has

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:27.940 
Capricorn and Venus in Capricorn has

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.270 
Capricorn and Venus in Capricorn has
weight<00:02:28.330> unto<00:02:28.750> herself<00:02:28.930> already<00:02:29.620> she<00:02:29.890> wants<00:02:30.160> to

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:30.280 
weight unto herself already she wants to

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.110 
weight unto herself already she wants to
follow<00:02:30.490> rules<00:02:30.880> she<00:02:31.600> has<00:02:31.720> strong<00:02:32.230> needs<00:02:32.709> in

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
follow rules she has strong needs in

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.000 
follow rules she has strong needs in
Capricorn<00:02:34.120> but<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:35.260> there's<00:02:35.590> a<00:02:35.680> certain

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
Capricorn but that there's a certain

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.460 
Capricorn but that there's a certain
seriousness<00:02:36.940> that<00:02:37.240> that<00:02:37.930> goes<00:02:38.140> along<00:02:38.320> with

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
seriousness that that goes along with

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.050 
seriousness that that goes along with
the<00:02:38.740> picture<00:02:39.070> and<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.430> think<00:02:39.640> that<00:02:39.760> becomes

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
the picture and I think that becomes

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.610 
the picture and I think that becomes
more<00:02:40.300> and<00:02:40.420> more<00:02:40.510> of<00:02:40.720> an<00:02:40.810> issue<00:02:40.930> as<00:02:41.230> the<00:02:41.440> month

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
more and more of an issue as the month

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.410 
more and more of an issue as the month
progresses<00:02:42.160> yeah<00:02:42.400> I<00:02:42.430> think<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.880> month<00:02:43.150> is

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
progresses yeah I think this month is

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.840 
progresses yeah I think this month is
complex<00:02:44.140> with<00:02:44.470> respect<00:02:44.950> to<00:02:45.100> relationships

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
complex with respect to relationships

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:47.490 
complex with respect to relationships
because<00:02:46.510> Venus<00:02:46.780> is<00:02:47.140> not<00:02:47.320> all<00:02:47.470> that

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
because Venus is not all that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.680 
because Venus is not all that
comfortable<00:02:47.920> in<00:02:48.310> Capricorn<00:02:48.880> venus<00:02:49.270> is<00:02:49.420> about

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
comfortable in Capricorn venus is about

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:52.440 
comfortable in Capricorn venus is about
sharing<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:51.000> Capricorn<00:02:52.000> is<00:02:52.180> about

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
sharing and Capricorn is about

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.160 
sharing and Capricorn is about
domination<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.830> yet<00:02:54.070> ironically<00:02:54.750> Mars<00:02:55.750> which

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
domination and yet ironically Mars which

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.050 
domination and yet ironically Mars which
is<00:02:56.320> a<00:02:56.350> planet<00:02:56.769> of<00:02:56.980> acting<00:02:57.430> in<00:02:57.610> one's<00:02:57.850> own

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
is a planet of acting in one's own

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.360 
is a planet of acting in one's own

planets move into Capricorn starting
with<00:03:37.600> with<00:03:38.260> the<00:03:38.440> Sun<00:03:38.709> what<00:03:39.489> happens<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.180> that

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
with with the Sun what happens is that

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.150 
with with the Sun what happens is that
these<00:03:40.630> planets<00:03:41.140> will<00:03:41.350> by<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.590> end<00:03:41.709> of<00:03:42.010> the

year beginning of the next of 2014 they

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.039 
year beginning of the next of 2014 they
will<00:03:45.459> come<00:03:45.670> into<00:03:45.970> contact<00:03:46.209> with<00:03:46.570> this<00:03:46.840> ongoing

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
will come into contact with this ongoing

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.949 
will come into contact with this ongoing
square<00:03:48.010> between<00:03:48.519> uranus<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.329> pluto<00:03:49.420> which

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:49.959 
square between uranus and pluto which

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.110 
square between uranus and pluto which
has<00:03:50.140> been<00:03:50.350> the<00:03:50.500> game<00:03:50.680> changer<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:51.910> last

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
has been the game changer for the last

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.270 
has been the game changer for the last
year<00:03:52.480> or<00:03:52.660> two<00:03:52.959> and<00:03:53.230> will<00:03:53.769> be<00:03:53.920> for<00:03:54.160> the<00:03:54.190> next

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
year or two and that kind of puts a

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:58.830 
year or two and that kind of puts a
different<00:03:56.950> tilt<00:03:57.280> on<00:03:57.549> the<00:03:57.850> energy<00:03:58.000> yeah<00:03:58.630> the

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
different tilt on the energy yeah the

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.690 
different tilt on the energy yeah the
end<00:03:58.989> of<00:03:59.140> this<00:03:59.260> month<00:03:59.470> is<00:03:59.739> a<00:03:59.769> bit<00:04:00.070> like<00:04:00.250> a<00:04:00.310> meat

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
grinder I mean the Sun goes into

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.920 
grinder I mean the Sun goes into
Capricorn<00:04:02.950> every<00:04:03.250> year<00:04:03.640> around<00:04:03.790> the<00:04:04.329> 21st

with aggressive Mars controlling Pluto

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.690 
with aggressive Mars controlling Pluto
and<00:04:18.820> complex<00:04:19.479> aspects<00:04:20.140> and<00:04:20.350> these<00:04:21.070> really

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
and complex aspects and these really

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.300 
and complex aspects and these really
turn<00:04:22.210> some<00:04:22.660> very<00:04:22.990> very<00:04:23.320> deep<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:24.010> not

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
turn some very very deep and not

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.540 
turn some very very deep and not
necessarily<00:04:24.550> comfortable

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
necessarily comfortable

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.140 
necessarily comfortable
right<00:04:26.940> and<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.300> I<00:04:27.330> think<00:04:27.449> part<00:04:28.080> of<00:04:28.319> the<00:04:28.729> goal<00:04:29.729> of

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
right and so I think part of the goal of

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.180 
right and so I think part of the goal of
the<00:04:30.419> month<00:04:30.659> is<00:04:30.900> to<00:04:31.379> look<00:04:31.620> ahead<00:04:31.800> and

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:32.190 
the month is to look ahead and

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:33.770 
the month is to look ahead and
understand<00:04:32.789> that<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> lot<00:04:33.120> of<00:04:33.360> what<00:04:33.629> we're

understand that a lot of what we're
doing<00:04:34.139> throughout<00:04:34.740> the<00:04:35.400> entire<00:04:35.729> month<00:04:36.150> is<00:04:36.569> in
