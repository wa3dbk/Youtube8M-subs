00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.319
 and we have to do the following about him 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.430
 catch 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:08.519
 I speak now because I'm scared 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:12.769
 that I could make mistakes so we 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.769
 put us here right here 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:22.740
 here go down a piece and press 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.140
 thereby directly state now so now have 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.789
 I just managed I have that now 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.060
 menu is activated and he sees us okay 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.000
 now we have to teleport ourselves completely 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.010
 important last pokémon center 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.899
 return yes and now we got caught 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.960
 warmly welcomed but we flee h 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.190
 very important that we escape and indeed 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.690
 We also have to work with this trainer 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.090
 then we just go here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:55.100
 high there not surprised the start button 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.100
 now no longer works only once 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:01.859
 now we have to go to this one 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 Trainers go here and their livestock win 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.909
 but not very close but a 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:09.990
 away please run him here 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:12.090
 so that he comes to us and the bite 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.740
 which is not a big defeat 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.740
 problem should be like that 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:27.479
 and now we have to go back 

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.479
 teleport to the poker center 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:31.659
 instead of taste should still not 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:33.250
 work properly, however, has a lot 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:35.049
 just a com always works 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.640
 but again we have one more 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.219
 make a very important step and indeed 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.149
 we have to go up here and then 

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:47.439
 the bridge will meet us all 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:48.789
 worked out the menu opens why 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:52.689
 we always close that 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:59.729
 again and bang who one is waiting for us there 

00:01:52.689 --> 00:02:01.599
 it is miu miu crass level 11 7 11 idiot 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.119
 of course we should not have any now 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:07.750
 attacke make no strong at least 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.970
 when are we making the same over 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.910
 If you have something to pokemon 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:16.209
 I can somehow sleep 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:19.420
 paralyzing it with pikachu that would be 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:22.329
 ever a little alternative to it 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.639
 somehow start to get ready and that 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:30.010
 with donna peele we can do it all 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:32.639
 just having to paralyze said that 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.639
 just catch 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.710
 I weaken a weak pokémon 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.600
 I should help with this 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.330
 use here medium if I still 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:53.210
 can because that reduces the accuracy 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:55.630
 over a few times sand invertebrates such 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.110
 that's just so inaccurate and so 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:03.080
 has no idea what's going on at all 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.570
 comes says sack now we switch times 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.830
 returns to pique away we are on 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:12.340
 our strongest pokemon and then put 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.340
 per a source 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:21.020
 maybe it will work on any 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:23.270
 caught a wondrous way 

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.250
 wonderful and so we would have mio 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.430
 a pokemon of the new kind resists 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.130
 four kilo 40 centimeters tall and flix 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.020
 perten doubt the existence of this 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.400
 pokémon only a few people have it 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.420
 seen and we own it now i 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.630
 I hope I could give you a little bit of that 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.630
 hang
