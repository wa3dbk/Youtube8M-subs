 there is enough instruction for us 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.850
 the instruction is necessary to think at all where 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:45.059

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:59.129

 I did not see any suitcase here and 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 only this is something very very very 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:32.670
