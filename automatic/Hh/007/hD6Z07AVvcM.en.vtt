other type of chemical it normally tends
to<00:00:34.680> compromise<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.850> protein<00:00:36.680> structure<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
to compromise the protein structure of

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.569

find the best way to distribute the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.969 
find the best way to distribute the
products<00:01:23.460> is<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> use<00:01:24.119> a<00:01:24.360> water<00:01:24.720> bottle<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:25.259> just

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
products is to use a water bottle I just

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.130 
products is to use a water bottle I just
poured<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.310> into<00:01:26.640> one<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.210> my<00:01:27.330> water<00:01:27.780> bottle

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
all over my hair and that pretty much

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:28.090 
all over my hair and that pretty much
completed<00:03:24.079> the<00:03:24.200> process<00:03:24.380> I<00:03:25.840> probably<00:03:26.980> like<00:03:27.980> I

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:28.100 
completed the process I probably like I

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.370 
completed the process I probably like I
said<00:03:28.310> won't<00:03:28.519> use<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:29.150> that<00:03:29.480> often<00:03:29.989> because<00:03:30.109> I

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
said won't use this that often because I

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.229 
said won't use this that often because I
think<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:30.920> is<00:03:31.040> a<00:03:31.069> very<00:03:31.340> strong<00:03:31.730> protein

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
think it is a very strong protein

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.069 
think it is a very strong protein
treatment<00:03:32.660> I<00:03:32.780> could<00:03:32.959> definitely<00:03:33.200> tell<00:03:35.019> by<00:03:36.019> the

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
treatment I could definitely tell by the

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.500 
treatment I could definitely tell by the
texture<00:03:36.530> of<00:03:36.650> my<00:03:36.769> hair<00:03:36.980> after<00:03:37.160> I<00:03:37.370> used<00:03:37.760> it<00:03:38.000> it

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
texture of my hair after I used it it

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.089 
texture of my hair after I used it it
was<00:03:38.680> a<00:03:39.680> little<00:03:40.040> I<00:03:40.790> don't<00:03:41.120> want<00:03:41.359> to<00:03:41.450> say<00:03:41.599> dry<00:03:42.099> but

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
was a little I don't want to say dry but

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:46.809 
was a little I don't want to say dry but
maybe<00:03:43.630> crispy<00:03:44.630> like<00:03:45.380> in<00:03:45.709> not<00:03:45.950> too<00:03:46.220> crispy<00:03:46.669> I

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
maybe crispy like in not too crispy I

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:49.539 
maybe crispy like in not too crispy I
didn't<00:03:47.180> experience<00:03:47.569> any<00:03:47.930> breakage<00:03:48.549> or

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
didn't experience any breakage or

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.030 
didn't experience any breakage or
anything<00:03:50.450> of<00:03:50.690> that<00:03:50.720> nature<00:03:50.870> but<00:03:51.319> I<00:03:51.349> did<00:03:51.680> notice

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
anything of that nature but I did notice

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.740 
anything of that nature but I did notice
that<00:03:52.069> my<00:03:52.190> hair<00:03:52.430> was<00:03:52.579> not<00:03:52.730> as<00:03:52.880> soft<00:03:53.239> as<00:03:53.569> it

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
that my hair was not as soft as it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.409 
that my hair was not as soft as it
normally<00:03:54.680> is<00:03:54.889> and<00:03:55.220> I<00:03:55.639> believe<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.120> was<00:03:56.269> due

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:56.419 
normally is and I believe that was due

00:03:56.419 --> 00:03:58.240 
normally is and I believe that was due
to<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.660> protein<00:03:57.019> what<00:03:57.650> I'll<00:03:57.769> probably<00:03:57.919> do

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
to the protein what I'll probably do

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.400 
to the protein what I'll probably do
next<00:03:58.549> week<00:03:58.700> is<00:03:58.910> come<00:03:59.180> back<00:03:59.389> and<00:03:59.660> do<00:04:00.200> like<00:04:00.380> a

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
next week is come back and do like a

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.069 
next week is come back and do like a
really<00:04:00.709> deep<00:04:01.040> moisture<00:04:01.900> treatment<00:04:02.900> on<00:04:02.959> my

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:03.079 
really deep moisture treatment on my

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:05.710 
really deep moisture treatment on my
hair<00:04:03.319> just<00:04:03.889> to<00:04:03.950> kind<00:04:04.130> of<00:04:04.160> balance<00:04:04.340> it<00:04:04.669> out<00:04:04.760> I<00:04:05.480> do

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
hair just to kind of balance it out I do

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.879 
hair just to kind of balance it out I do
know<00:04:06.109> that<00:04:06.139> some<00:04:06.410> people<00:04:06.470> said<00:04:06.739> they

of the products out of your hair do a

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.100 
of the products out of your hair do a
heavy<00:04:24.400> rinse<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:25.030> spent<00:04:25.690> a<00:04:25.750> lot<00:04:25.840> of<00:04:25.900> time

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110 
heavy rinse I spent a lot of time

heavy rinse I spent a lot of time
rinsing<00:04:26.680> my<00:04:26.980> hair<00:04:27.220> after<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.610> did<00:04:27.880> the<00:04:28.030> two

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:28.210 
rinsing my hair after I did the two

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.240 
rinsing my hair after I did the two
steps<00:04:28.510> protein<00:04:28.960> treatment<00:04:29.380> just<00:04:30.040> to<00:04:30.100> make

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
steps protein treatment just to make

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.500 
steps protein treatment just to make
sure<00:04:30.340> that<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.490> got<00:04:30.670> it<00:04:30.790> all<00:04:30.910> out<00:04:30.940> of<00:04:31.090> my<00:04:31.210> hair<00:04:31.390> my

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:31.510 
sure that I got it all out of my hair my

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:33.330 
sure that I got it all out of my hair my
hair<00:04:31.540> is<00:04:31.690> really<00:04:31.900> really<00:04:32.140> thick<00:04:32.410> and<00:04:32.680> it<00:04:33.130> tends

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
hair is really really thick and it tends

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:35.130 
hair is really really thick and it tends
to<00:04:33.490> hold<00:04:33.580> on<00:04:33.730> to<00:04:33.880> products<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.420> lot<00:04:34.660> and<00:04:34.930> so<00:04:35.110> I

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:35.140 
to hold on to products a lot and so I

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:37.410 
to hold on to products a lot and so I
have<00:04:35.320> to<00:04:35.440> do<00:04:35.530> the<00:04:35.620> high<00:04:35.740> pressure<00:04:36.100> nozzle<00:04:36.820> and

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:37.420 
have to do the high pressure nozzle and

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.400 
have to do the high pressure nozzle and
make<00:04:38.410> sure<00:04:38.560> that<00:04:38.680> I<00:04:38.740> really<00:04:39.190> get<00:04:39.790> that<00:04:40.180> can<00:04:40.780> the

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
make sure that I really get that can the

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.870 
make sure that I really get that can the
product<00:04:42.010> out<00:04:42.310> of<00:04:42.340> my<00:04:42.550> hair

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:42.880 
product out of my hair

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.570 
product out of my hair
I<00:04:42.910> do<00:04:43.000> recommend<00:04:43.360> using<00:04:44.020> a<00:04:44.470> conditioner<00:04:45.370> deep

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
I do recommend using a conditioner deep

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.430 
I do recommend using a conditioner deep
conditioner<00:04:46.060> after<00:04:46.300> you<00:04:46.990> do<00:04:47.140> the<00:04:47.260> treatment

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
conditioner after you do the treatment

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:50.940 
conditioner after you do the treatment
but<00:04:48.430> I<00:04:48.460> would<00:04:48.940> advise<00:04:49.240> people<00:04:49.930> to<00:04:50.110> make<00:04:50.920> sure

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
but I would advise people to make sure

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:53.430 
but I would advise people to make sure
they<00:04:51.280> check<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:51.970> ingredients<00:04:52.660> in<00:04:52.840> your

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
they check the ingredients in your

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.110 
they check the ingredients in your
conditioner<00:04:54.100> because<00:04:54.280> some<00:04:54.640> conditioners

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.120 
conditioner because some conditioners

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.600 
conditioner because some conditioners
actually<00:04:55.720> have<00:04:55.870> protein<00:04:56.320> in<00:04:56.530> them<00:04:56.830> it<00:04:57.310> may<00:04:57.430> not

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
actually have protein in them it may not

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.850 
actually have protein in them it may not
say<00:04:57.820> protein<00:04:58.420> but<00:04:58.600> if<00:04:58.720> you<00:04:58.840> google<00:04:59.110> googles<00:04:59.740> my

say protein but if you google googles my

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.040 
say protein but if you google googles my
best<00:05:00.070> friend<00:05:00.310> if<00:05:00.640> you<00:05:00.850> google<00:05:01.300> how<00:05:01.990> to

best friend if you google how to

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.440 
best friend if you google how to
identify<00:05:02.320> protein<00:05:03.130> in<00:05:03.370> hair<00:05:03.580> products<00:05:04.060> it

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:04.450 
identify protein in hair products it

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:06.120 
identify protein in hair products it
will<00:05:04.690> show<00:05:04.930> you<00:05:04.990> now<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.320> come<00:05:05.500> up<00:05:05.650> with<00:05:05.800> a<00:05:05.830> list

will show you now to come up with a list

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:09.030 
will show you now to come up with a list
you<00:05:06.280> can<00:05:06.400> find<00:05:06.610> it<00:05:06.970> on<00:05:07.180> different<00:05:07.390> websites<00:05:08.050> a

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:09.040 
you can find it on different websites a

you can find it on different websites a
list<00:05:09.700> of<00:05:09.970> like<00:05:10.150> the<00:05:10.300> scientific<00:05:10.840> name<00:05:11.020> for

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
list of like the scientific name for

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.440 
list of like the scientific name for
some<00:05:11.830> of<00:05:11.920> the<00:05:11.980> proteins<00:05:12.400> that<00:05:12.550> companies<00:05:13.420> put

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
some of the proteins that companies put

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:15.960 
some of the proteins that companies put
in<00:05:13.900> their<00:05:14.110> products<00:05:14.590> so<00:05:15.100> what<00:05:15.550> you<00:05:15.640> don't<00:05:15.820> want

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
in their products so what you don't want

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.510 
in their products so what you don't want
to<00:05:16.030> do<00:05:16.150> is<00:05:16.420> go<00:05:16.840> back<00:05:17.050> in<00:05:17.320> and<00:05:17.920> call<00:05:18.400> yourself

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
to do is go back in and call yourself

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:20.730 
to do is go back in and call yourself

of it that may not be too good because

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.570 
of it that may not be too good because
you<00:05:25.120> can<00:05:25.390> overdo<00:05:26.230> it<00:05:26.380> you<00:05:26.680> can<00:05:26.890> add<00:05:27.160> too<00:05:27.430> much

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
you can overdo it you can add too much

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:29.550 
you can overdo it you can add too much
protein<00:05:27.970> to<00:05:28.180> your<00:05:28.330> hair<00:05:28.570> and<00:05:28.780> that<00:05:28.810> can<00:05:29.350> cause

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
protein to your hair and that can cause

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.340 
protein to your hair and that can cause
breakage<00:05:30.160> so<00:05:31.030> it's<00:05:31.270> a<00:05:31.390> fine<00:05:31.600> balance<00:05:32.260> between

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
breakage so it's a fine balance between

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.820 
breakage so it's a fine balance between
protein<00:05:33.310> and<00:05:33.720> moisturizing<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:35.290> that's

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:35.830 
protein and moisturizing so that's

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:36.870 
protein and moisturizing so that's
something<00:05:36.070> that<00:05:36.220> you<00:05:36.430> want<00:05:36.490> to<00:05:36.610> be<00:05:36.670> careful

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
something that you want to be careful

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.980 
something that you want to be careful
with<00:05:37.270> but<00:05:37.810> overall<00:05:38.140> my<00:05:38.440> experience<00:05:38.470> with<00:05:39.460> the

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:39.990 
with but overall my experience with the

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.610 
with but overall my experience with the
two-step<00:05:40.990> protein<00:05:41.560> treatment<00:05:41.980> was<00:05:42.520> a<00:05:42.550> decent

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:43.620 
two-step protein treatment was a decent

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:45.990 
two-step protein treatment was a decent
experience<00:05:44.620> it<00:05:44.800> wasn't<00:05:45.070> too<00:05:45.190> bad<00:05:45.340> like<00:05:45.730> I<00:05:45.820> said

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
experience it wasn't too bad like I said

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.150 
experience it wasn't too bad like I said
I<00:05:46.030> probably<00:05:46.330> won't<00:05:46.720> do<00:05:47.050> it<00:05:47.260> I<00:05:47.440> don't<00:05:47.620> think<00:05:47.800> my

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:48.160 
I probably won't do it I don't think my

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.310 
I probably won't do it I don't think my
hair<00:05:48.370> needs<00:05:48.610> it<00:05:48.880> that<00:05:48.910> often<00:05:49.570> I<00:05:49.780> probably

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:50.320 
hair needs it that often I probably

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:53.910 
hair needs it that often I probably
might<00:05:50.680> do<00:05:50.890> it<00:05:51.010> maybe<00:05:51.750> twice<00:05:52.750> or<00:05:53.230> three<00:05:53.530> times<00:05:53.560> a

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:53.920 
might do it maybe twice or three times a

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:55.680 
might do it maybe twice or three times a
year<00:05:53.950> and<00:05:54.340> that<00:05:54.400> might<00:05:55.150> be<00:05:55.180> good<00:05:55.480> enough

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
year and that might be good enough

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.590 
year and that might be good enough
especially<00:05:55.960> something<00:05:56.590> as<00:05:56.860> strong<00:05:57.190> as<00:05:57.600> the

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:58.600 
especially something as strong as the

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:00.900 
especially something as strong as the
Appaji<00:05:59.470> protein<00:06:00.250> treatment<00:06:00.610> because<00:06:00.820> I<00:06:00.850> think

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
Appaji protein treatment because I think

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:02.460 
Appaji protein treatment because I think
it<00:06:01.150> is<00:06:01.240> one<00:06:01.360> of<00:06:01.390> the<00:06:01.540> stronger<00:06:01.900> protein

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:02.470 
it is one of the stronger protein

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.820 
it is one of the stronger protein
treatments<00:06:03.460> there<00:06:03.640> are<00:06:03.790> other<00:06:04.680> products<00:06:05.680> out

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:05.830 
treatments there are other products out

00:06:05.830 --> 00:06:07.700 
treatments there are other products out
there<00:06:05.920> that<00:06:06.160> will<00:06:06.550> kind<00:06:06.820> of<00:06:06.880> give<00:06:07.090> you<00:06:07.240> a<00:06:07.270> mild

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710 
there that will kind of give you a mild

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.750 
there that will kind of give you a mild
protein<00:06:08.710> treatment<00:06:09.130> that<00:06:09.280> are<00:06:09.370> a<00:06:09.400> little<00:06:09.550> more

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:09.760 
protein treatment that are a little more

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:11.880 
protein treatment that are a little more
gentle<00:06:10.120> I<00:06:10.270> think<00:06:10.540> you<00:06:11.290> just<00:06:11.440> have<00:06:11.560> to<00:06:11.650> look<00:06:11.800> it

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:11.890 
gentle I think you just have to look it

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:13.500 
gentle I think you just have to look it
up<00:06:11.950> and<00:06:12.130> do<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.280> research<00:06:12.430> or<00:06:12.880> I<00:06:12.910> might

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:13.510 
up and do the research or I might

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:15.960 
up and do the research or I might
probably<00:06:14.170> do<00:06:14.350> like<00:06:14.650> a<00:06:14.920> natural<00:06:15.670> protein

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
probably do like a natural protein

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:18.900 
probably do like a natural protein
treatment<00:06:16.810> maybe<00:06:17.680> adding<00:06:18.100> an<00:06:18.190> egg

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
treatment maybe adding an egg

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.850 
treatment maybe adding an egg
or<00:06:19.000> something<00:06:19.360> to<00:06:19.480> my<00:06:19.600> conditioner<00:06:20.320> something

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
or something to my conditioner something

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.730 
or something to my conditioner something
that<00:06:20.980> may<00:06:21.100> not<00:06:21.190> be<00:06:21.250> as<00:06:21.550> harsh<00:06:22.060> as<00:06:22.330> the<00:06:22.870> Apogee

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
that may not be as harsh as the Apogee

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.470 
that may not be as harsh as the Apogee
protein<00:06:24.250> treatment<00:06:24.610> I<00:06:24.880> want<00:06:25.210> to<00:06:25.270> thank<00:06:25.390> you

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:25.480 
protein treatment I want to thank you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.060 
protein treatment I want to thank you

treatment<00:06:34.290> and<00:06:35.290> like<00:06:35.500> I<00:06:35.650> said<00:06:35.860> I<00:06:35.890> wouldn't

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
treatment and like I said I wouldn't

treatments but I do want to say you know
make<00:06:55.450> sure<00:06:55.600> you<00:06:55.690> do<00:06:55.780> your<00:06:55.930> homework<00:06:55.960> and<00:06:56.940> make

00:06:59.940 --> 00:06:59.950 
sure you do your research regarding

00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.920 
sure you do your research regarding
protein<00:07:00.730> treatments<00:07:01.210> because<00:07:01.510> you<00:07:01.750> don't

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
protein treatments because you don't

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.990 
protein treatments because you don't
want<00:07:02.140> to<00:07:02.230> overdo<00:07:03.130> it<00:07:03.160> and<00:07:03.430> some<00:07:03.760> of<00:07:03.850> you<00:07:03.940> guys

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:04.000 
want to overdo it and some of you guys

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.090 
want to overdo it and some of you guys
may<00:07:04.300> not<00:07:04.420> even<00:07:04.570> need<00:07:04.900> a<00:07:05.230> strong<00:07:05.620> protein

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.100 
may not even need a strong protein

00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.250 
may not even need a strong protein
treatment<00:07:06.520> it<00:07:06.850> just<00:07:07.120> depends<00:07:07.570> but<00:07:07.690> overall<00:07:07.990> my

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:08.260 
treatment it just depends but overall my

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:12.270 
treatment it just depends but overall my
hair<00:07:08.530> still<00:07:09.070> feels<00:07:09.660> decent<00:07:10.660> it's<00:07:11.140> not<00:07:11.350> the

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:12.280 
hair still feels decent it's not the

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:13.860 
hair still feels decent it's not the
same<00:07:12.700> I<00:07:13.120> can<00:07:13.180> definitely<00:07:13.450> tell<00:07:13.780> the

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:13.870 
same I can definitely tell the

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:17.400 
same I can definitely tell the
difference<00:07:13.900> but<00:07:14.590> overall<00:07:16.050> you<00:07:17.050> know<00:07:17.170> I<00:07:17.200> got
