00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.590 
series baseball games I liked I like 97
and<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:15.010> and<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.820> first<00:02:16.060> one<00:02:16.209> on<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.330> sound

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
and and and the first one on the sound

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:17.850 
and and and the first one on the sound
and<00:02:16.720> they<00:02:16.780> were<00:02:16.870> both<00:02:16.989> really<00:02:17.170> cool<00:02:17.440> I<00:02:17.650> love

the<00:02:18.040> the<00:02:18.550> new<00:02:18.700> one<00:02:18.880> too<00:02:19.090> but<00:02:19.450> i<00:02:19.630> think<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.020> the

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
the the new one too but i think the the

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.740 
the the new one too but i think the the
polygon<00:02:21.250> stuff<00:02:21.520> was<00:02:21.700> kind<00:02:21.970> of<00:02:22.030> unnecessary<00:02:22.239> it

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
polygon stuff was kind of unnecessary it

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:25.199 
polygon stuff was kind of unnecessary it
looks<00:02:22.959> slick<00:02:23.290> I<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.520> new<00:02:24.790> camera

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.550 
looks slick I like the the new camera
options<00:02:25.600> that<00:02:25.720> they<00:02:25.750> have<00:02:25.989> and<00:02:26.230> it's<00:02:26.380> got

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
options that they have and it's got

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.560 
options that they have and it's got
these<00:02:26.709> little<00:02:26.890> cool<00:02:27.190> little<00:02:27.430> cinema<00:02:28.120> intros

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
these little cool little cinema intros

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.539 
these little cool little cinema intros
right<00:02:28.989> i<00:02:29.230> think<00:02:29.620> i<00:02:29.860> agree<00:02:30.070> with<00:02:30.100> you<00:02:30.220> with<00:02:30.430> the

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
right i think i agree with you with the

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.630 
right i think i agree with you with the
two-by-four<00:02:31.420> I<00:02:31.630> like<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.320> new<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:32.709> like<00:02:33.489> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
two-by-four I like the new I like the

new<00:02:33.760> pitching<00:02:34.000> options<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.630> think<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.930> gives

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
new pitching options I think that gives

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.229 
new pitching options I think that gives
a<00:02:35.140> little<00:02:35.290> more<00:02:35.410> simulation<00:02:36.100> feel<00:02:36.370> but<00:02:37.000> I

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:37.239 
a little more simulation feel but I

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.390 
a little more simulation feel but I
still<00:02:38.200> prefer<00:02:38.350> the<00:02:38.620> old<00:02:38.769> world<00:02:38.950> series<00:02:39.280> i'd
