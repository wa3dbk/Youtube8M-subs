00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
everybody what I got here is a little

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.379 
everybody what I got here is a little
tent<00:00:06.210> heater<00:00:06.450> I've<00:00:06.660> been<00:00:06.810> working<00:00:07.170> on<00:00:08.389> where

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
tent heater I've been working on where

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.060 
tent heater I've been working on where
it<00:00:09.480> is<00:00:09.599> basically<00:00:09.990> as<00:00:10.170> a<00:00:10.200> wood<00:00:10.440> stove<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.980> you

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
it is basically as a wood stove that you

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:23.950 
it is basically as a wood stove that you
put<00:00:11.280> outside<00:00:11.639> your<00:00:11.849> tent<00:00:21.949> it's<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.279> good

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:23.960 
put outside your tent it's going good

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.570 
put outside your tent it's going good
and<00:00:25.490> the<00:00:26.490> chimney<00:00:26.789> I<00:00:28.010> put<00:00:29.010> a<00:00:29.039> little<00:00:29.369> heat

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
and the chimney I put a little heat

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.240 
and the chimney I put a little heat
exchanger<00:00:30.179> on<00:00:30.330> top<00:00:31.489> and<00:00:32.489> that's<00:00:32.640> just<00:00:34.250> there's

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
exchanger on top and that's just there's

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.510 
exchanger on top and that's just there's
some<00:00:35.370> thick<00:00:36.469> h8<00:00:37.530> inch<00:00:39.530> three<00:00:40.530> inch<00:00:40.559> steel

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
some thick h8 inch three inch steel

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.850 
some thick h8 inch three inch steel
pipes<00:00:41.850> running<00:00:42.270> through<00:00:42.540> here<00:00:42.870> and<00:00:43.680> that's

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
pipes running through here and that's

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.400 
pipes running through here and that's
connected<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.420> air<00:00:45.539> flows<00:00:45.899> around<00:00:45.930> like

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
connected and the air flows around like

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.799 
connected and the air flows around like
that<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:46.950> it<00:00:47.070> gets<00:00:47.280> heated<00:00:48.469> in<00:00:49.469> the<00:00:49.590> chimney

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
that so it gets heated in the chimney

00:00:50.809 --> 00:01:00.560 
that so it gets heated in the chimney
and<00:00:51.920> here<00:00:56.000> we<00:00:57.000> got<00:00:57.210> so<00:00:57.920> it's<00:00:58.920> hard<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.190> see<00:00:59.570> two

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
and here we got so it's hard to see two

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.100 
and here we got so it's hard to see two
computer<00:01:01.079> fans<00:01:02.000> and<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.120> top<00:01:03.329> one<00:01:03.629> sucking

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
computer fans and the top one sucking

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.859 
computer fans and the top one sucking
the<00:01:04.710> cold<00:01:04.920> air<00:01:05.129> in<00:01:05.309> from<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.610> tent<00:01:05.850> going<00:01:06.659> back

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
the cold air in from the tent going back

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.320 
the cold air in from the tent going back
and<00:01:07.140> then<00:01:07.430> blowing<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> out<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.850> bottom<00:01:09.030> one

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
and then blowing it out the bottom one

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.399 
and then blowing it out the bottom one
here<00:01:11.150> and<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.299> actually<00:01:12.689> really<00:01:12.930> warm<00:01:13.110> air

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
here and it's actually really warm air

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.039 
here and it's actually really warm air
that's<00:01:13.439> that's<00:01:14.250> getting<00:01:14.520> pumped<00:01:14.729> out<00:01:14.909> and<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's that's getting pumped out and the

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:18.200 
that's that's getting pumped out and the
vents<00:01:16.890> are<00:01:17.009> pretty<00:01:17.250> cool<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.700> bottom<00:01:18.090> ones

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
vents are pretty cool the bottom ones

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.570 
vents are pretty cool the bottom ones
kind<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.479> warm<00:01:18.689> but<00:01:19.170> top<00:01:19.740> ones<00:01:19.950> really<00:01:20.130> cool<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
kind of warm but top ones really cool to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.469 
kind of warm but top ones really cool to
the<00:01:20.670> touch<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.590> I<00:01:22.590> just<00:01:23.580> got<00:01:23.729> these<00:01:23.880> plugged

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479

into the wall right now just hooked up

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.630 
into the wall right now just hooked up
on<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.570> 12-volt<00:01:28.130> converter<00:01:30.290> wired<00:01:31.290> up<00:01:31.640> really

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
on a 12-volt converter wired up really

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.490 
on a 12-volt converter wired up really
expertly<00:01:33.090> right<00:01:33.390> there<00:01:33.600> see<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.170> electrical

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
expertly right there see the electrical

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.899 
expertly right there see the electrical
tape<00:01:34.680> sticking<00:01:35.009> up<00:01:35.100> um<00:01:35.689> but<00:01:36.689> I<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.990> this<00:01:37.909> this

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
tape sticking up um but I got this this

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.789 
tape sticking up um but I got this this
battery<00:01:40.700> or<00:01:43.700> when<00:01:44.700> I'm<00:01:44.820> camping<00:01:45.560> so<00:01:46.560> I'll<00:01:46.619> just

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
hook that up there's 22 amps so it's

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.749 
hook that up there's 22 amps so it's
supposed<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> last<00:01:49.350> about<00:01:49.610> probably<00:01:50.610> last
