00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
controls except as a one-off gimmick but

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.970 
controls except as a one-off gimmick but
I<00:03:37.239> did<00:03:37.629> that<00:03:37.840> with<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.079> playstation<00:03:38.590> 2<00:03:38.709> is<00:03:38.769> I

the<00:03:41.650> Xbox<00:03:41.890> one<00:03:42.220> the<00:03:42.430> playstation<00:03:42.849> 4<00:03:43.000> doesn't

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
the Xbox one the playstation 4 doesn't

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.210 
the Xbox one the playstation 4 doesn't
include<00:03:43.510> a<00:03:43.659> camera<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.170> let's<00:03:44.799> reduce<00:03:44.980> the

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
include a camera and let's reduce the

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.160 
include a camera and let's reduce the
price<00:03:45.430> by<00:03:45.459> that<00:03:45.760> one<00:03:45.879> hundred<00:03:46.030> dollars<00:03:46.450> it

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:47.170 
price by that one hundred dollars it

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:53.000 
price by that one hundred dollars it
wins<00:03:47.470> this<00:03:47.620> round

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.220 

obviously<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.150> price<00:03:54.360> of<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.659> systems<00:03:55.019> will

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
obviously the price of the systems will

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:56.690 
obviously the price of the systems will
be<00:03:55.349> a<00:03:55.379> major<00:03:55.590> point<00:03:55.920> for<00:03:56.129> a<00:03:56.189> lot<00:03:56.220> of<00:03:56.310> people<00:03:56.430> out

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
be a major point for a lot of people out

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.580 
be a major point for a lot of people out
there<00:03:56.730> I'm<00:03:57.239> with<00:03:57.420> the<00:03:57.510> ps4<00:03:57.810> being<00:03:58.290> cheaper

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
there I'm with the ps4 being cheaper

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.380 
there I'm with the ps4 being cheaper
everywhere<00:03:58.950> it's<00:03:59.400> pretty<00:03:59.760> clear-cut<00:04:00.060> winner

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
everywhere it's pretty clear-cut winner

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.330 
everywhere it's pretty clear-cut winner
for<00:04:00.659> this<00:04:00.750> round<00:04:00.989> so<00:04:01.590> there<00:04:01.799> we<00:04:01.950> have<00:04:01.980> the

for this round so there we have the

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:03.830 
for this round so there we have the
playstation<00:04:02.549> 4<00:04:02.970> seems<00:04:03.299> to<00:04:03.510> be<00:04:03.629> the<00:04:03.720> more

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
playstation 4 seems to be the more

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.380 
playstation 4 seems to be the more
sensible<00:04:04.290> choice<00:04:04.530> if<00:04:04.709> you<00:04:04.739> want<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:05.129> play<00:04:05.280> a
