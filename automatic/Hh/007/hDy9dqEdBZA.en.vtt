00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.990
 I've never really realized that 

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.860
 every day there are more than 100,000 people 

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.570
 waiting for a new video on the channel 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:12.290
 and everything we do when we enter 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.139
 watch a new video and what we want to see 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:19.680
 are tits we do not want to see a video 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:22.470
 central have fun 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.960
 have a good time were the videos of 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.180
 leaving us things and so on so that 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.830
 are the channels my channel is for 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.300
 fun and after playing 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.910
 during yesterday a long time 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.520
 as I did a lot that I did not play 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.380
 since the end of the year he did not play between 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.250
 three or four games in a row and yesterday 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.040
 well I said I will give one last 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.720
 opportunity and really what had to be 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.940
 to do is rest if you touch me 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.080
 game there are thousands of games over tells me 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.960
 is forcing you to play no game 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:55.140
 you have incredible you like skyring 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.230
 battlefield the minecraft pc games in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:01.110
 my case there are thousands of games so 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.120
 they will give forward be happy not with the 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.700
 game I think you never have to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.390
 transmit on a channel bad feelings 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.390
 neither 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:13.560
 in a video say how disgusting this helmet 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.810
 the other because in the end there is any 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 that go to see your video or the 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.260
 channel is not going to go with a smile that 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.000
 is what I personally like 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:24.150
 that anyone who enters the channel 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.940
 Go encouraged not say that 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:29.280
 example go away wanting not to be 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.510
 come forward to practically throw it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.270
 all overboard to himself towards him 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.670
 then it's a channel we're going to pass it on 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.200
 well and that's what I did I took a 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.150
 yesterday's game was when pretty 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.700
 I took out quite a few good games 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.190
 practically not present pretend it 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.440
 so as you are seeing now it is 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:48.060
 using the upv with a fast fire 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.210
 as you are seeing at the level of others 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.760
 times from one place to another 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.690
 and that weapon I took yesterday for peace 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.340
 that the map is a weapon as well as 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.659
 any other let's say it's good bad 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.430
 depending if to take soil is 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.090
 great if you put it on you do not kill 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.700
 no one 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.490
 that's as usual 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.580
 with the web that looks will be that look look 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.500
 look at other chargers outside it will be by 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.780
 bullets these bullets everywhere with a 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:15.760
 fast game any your rifle with 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.040
 fast fire is to say the whole game 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.459
 it's a frenzy does not last more than four 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.620
 minutes and the truth is that it is constant 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.890
 constant the movement of side to 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.810
 other 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.370
 simply enjoy enjoying if 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.040
 yesterday I really did not know how to see the 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.129
 I already go on for a long time and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.260
 enjoying to the fullest and I say if you could 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.440
 see good if you could do some live 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.480
 streaming that I have enough problems 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.370
 I've had a great time because I'm 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.769
 playing was playing in fact alone and 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.480
 there with my music can be pim pam 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:48.819
 could kill and good as you see now 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.840
 example I knew I had people from 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.489
 crossing you have seen how he gave me 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.230
 moving having the tank just at 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.480
 side at the same time that I'm going to stop before 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.030
 the tank covered me from behind and not here 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:01.060
 once again as you already know I play more 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:02.200
 times looking at the map ie radar 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.280
 because I knew that for example here there was 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.200
 one 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.480
 a lot more game watching the radar of 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.069
 up that looking at me and did not see 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.620
 the red dots but look at the dots 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.300
 green the green arrows that I see above 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:15.550
 are the ones that tell me where the 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.010
 enemies if you see a green arrow there is no 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:20.650
 a red dot next to never so 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:23.140
 It tells you practically be a radar 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.239
 not if you are very high all the radar and 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.470
 you are fixed between the red points more 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.870
 bad because many people carrying 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.910
 bring killer because you do not have a radar 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.680
 and they do not shoot and you do not see him so 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.450
 you have to really realize what 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.310
 is what you are looking for in the best 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.260
 way that leaves where the arrows 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.080
 yellow sorry green and of not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.230
 My mother mate has been really 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.050
 I cut a great game of 37-1 in little 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.400
 more than three and a half minutes so nothing 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.840
 I hope you like it I hope it is 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.910
 we said kings with a smile but 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.800
 have a look at the bid yesterday and know how to be 

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:56.470
