so<00:02:15.760> they<00:02:15.910> argue<00:02:16.300> that<00:02:16.330> if<00:02:16.690> 13%<00:02:17.590> of<00:02:17.710> say<00:02:17.920> the<00:02:18.070> UK

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
so they argue that if 13% of say the UK

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.980 
so they argue that if 13% of say the UK
population<00:02:18.580> that's<00:02:19.180> roughly<00:02:19.510> equivalent<00:02:19.720> to

the population of London were at risk

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.730 
the population of London were at risk
there<00:02:22.510> would<00:02:22.660> be<00:02:22.690> a<00:02:22.840> call<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.350> course<00:02:23.560> for

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
there would be a call of course for

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.320 
there would be a call of course for
urgent<00:02:24.070> action<00:02:24.160> in<00:02:24.460> order<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.760> protect<00:02:24.940> them

urgent action in order to protect them

and that's what Israelis are claiming

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.230 
and that's what Israelis are claiming
they're<00:02:27.190> doing<00:02:27.430> at<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.760> moment

the Palestinians absolutely well I've

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:53.760 
the Palestinians absolutely well I've
heard<00:02:51.910> that<00:02:51.970> suggestion<00:02:52.720> coming<00:02:53.230> from<00:02:53.410> Jeremy

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
heard that suggestion coming from Jeremy

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:55.380 
heard that suggestion coming from Jeremy

Bowen in particular on the BBC and

Bowen in particular on the BBC and

others but I personally don't think that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:59.550 
others but I personally don't think that
it<00:02:57.700> holds<00:02:57.850> much<00:02:58.120> water<00:02:58.390> I<00:02:58.690> think<00:02:58.930> that<00:02:59.230> Israel

00:02:59.550 --> 00:02:59.560 
it holds much water I think that Israel

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.530 
it holds much water I think that Israel

those security needs of the population
