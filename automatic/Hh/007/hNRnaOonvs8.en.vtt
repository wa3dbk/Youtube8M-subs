00:00:50.689 --> 00:00:50.699 
supposed to do so that's when I started

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.799 
supposed to do so that's when I started
realized<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.710> there<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.830> just<00:00:53.010> some<00:00:53.190> sort<00:00:53.400> of

00:00:53.799 --> 00:00:53.809 
realized it there was just some sort of

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.119 
realized it there was just some sort of
yeah<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.019> in<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.229> ether<00:00:55.409> rule<00:00:55.769> about

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
yeah it's in the ether rule about

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.180 
yeah it's in the ether rule about
Arizona<00:00:56.790> yeah<00:00:57.420> I<00:00:57.720> think<00:00:58.080> that<00:00:58.530> it's<00:00:58.680> a<00:00:58.830> notion

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
Arizona yeah I think that it's a notion

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.570 
Arizona yeah I think that it's a notion
that<00:00:59.519> has<00:01:00.030> grown<00:01:00.900> out<00:01:01.290> of<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:02.129> way<00:01:02.280> he's<00:01:02.460> been

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:02.580 
that has grown out of the way he's been

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.260 
that has grown out of the way he's been
popularized<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.769> TV<00:01:04.769> and<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.129> movies<00:01:05.270> more

popularized on TV and in the movies more

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.270 
popularized on TV and in the movies more
than<00:01:06.570> the<00:01:06.810> sort<00:01:07.110> of<00:01:07.170> comic<00:01:07.530> book<00:01:07.680> mythology<00:01:08.250> of

practical hero killing General Zod is a
practical<00:01:15.330> solution<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.320> problem<00:01:16.710> he

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
practical solution to the problem he

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.469 
practical solution to the problem he
wouldn't<00:01:17.220> let<00:01:17.340> his<00:01:17.490> personal<00:01:17.700> sort<00:01:18.360> of

wouldn't let his personal sort of
aversion<00:01:19.289> to<00:01:19.619> killing<00:01:20.100> cost<00:01:21.000> hit<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.659> lives

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
aversion to killing cost hit the lives

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.529 
aversion to killing cost hit the lives
of<00:01:22.409> an<00:01:22.619> entire<00:01:22.649> planet<00:01:23.189> or<00:01:23.850> even<00:01:23.880> that<00:01:24.390> little

00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
of an entire planet or even that little

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:26.719 
of an entire planet or even that little
kid<00:01:24.930> did<00:01:25.140> also<00:01:25.439> kids<00:01:25.829> yeah<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.490> little

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.789 
kid did also kids yeah that little
family<00:01:27.149> so<00:01:27.719> like<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:27.990> he<00:01:28.140> had<00:01:28.259> said<00:01:28.469> like<00:01:28.619> well

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
family so like if he had said like well

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.620 
family so like if he had said like well
I<00:01:28.829> just<00:01:29.130> am<00:01:29.250> morally<00:01:29.640> opposed<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> killing<00:01:30.270> so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
I just am morally opposed to killing so

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.330 
I just am morally opposed to killing so
I<00:01:30.659> guess<00:01:30.840> I<00:01:30.930> have<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.170> let<00:01:31.320> him<00:01:31.469> kill<00:01:32.070> those

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
I guess I have to let him kill those

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.870 
I guess I have to let him kill those
people

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
people

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.270 
people
yeah<00:01:33.600> that's<00:01:33.840> those<00:01:34.289> those<00:01:34.649> are<00:01:34.680> the<00:01:34.829> dilemmas

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
yeah that's those those are the dilemmas

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.490 
yeah that's those those are the dilemmas
and<00:01:35.399> we<00:01:35.579> set<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.060> directly<00:01:36.899> so<00:01:37.259> that

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
and we set that up directly so that

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.709 
and we set that up directly so that
there<00:01:38.219> would<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.399> no<00:01:38.759> solution<00:01:39.000> other<00:01:39.600> than

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:39.719 
there would be no solution other than

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:42.440 
there would be no solution other than
that<00:01:40.680> solution<00:01:41.399> yeah<00:01:41.789> I<00:01:41.820> mean<00:01:42.000> for<00:01:42.180> me<00:01:42.299> it's

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
that solution yeah I mean for me it's

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.520 
that solution yeah I mean for me it's
like<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.780> could<00:01:42.899> turn<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.200> question<00:01:43.500> back

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
like you could turn the question back

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:44.959 
like you could turn the question back
around<00:01:43.859> and<00:01:44.039> say<00:01:44.130> why<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.399> this<00:01:44.549> something

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:44.969 
around and say why is this something

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:47.510 
around and say why is this something
that<00:01:45.149> really<00:01:45.659> people<00:01:46.500> seem<00:01:46.859> to<00:01:46.890> have<00:01:47.009> take

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
that really people seem to have take

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.580 
that really people seem to have take
issue<00:01:47.729> with<00:01:47.909> because<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:48.630> like<00:01:48.869> there's<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
issue with because it's like there's a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.340 
issue with because it's like there's a
comforting<00:01:50.399> idea<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:51.210> Superman<00:01:51.869> wouldn't<00:01:52.170> I

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
comforting idea that Superman wouldn't I

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
comforting idea that Superman wouldn't I
mean<00:01:52.679> it's<00:01:53.159> not<00:01:53.280> like<00:01:53.429> something<00:01:53.850> that

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
mean it's not like something that

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.819 
mean it's not like something that
doesn't<00:01:54.000> exist<00:01:54.630> in<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> real<00:01:55.020> world<00:01:55.439> no<00:01:55.619> and

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
doesn't exist in the real world no and

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.499 
doesn't exist in the real world no and
it's<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.009> real-world<00:01:56.219> problem<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.149> by<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.390> way

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it's a real-world problem and by the way

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.840 
it's a real-world problem and by the way
I<00:01:57.539> think<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.840> effect<00:01:58.109> on<00:01:58.380> Superman<00:01:58.619> he's<00:01:59.549> not

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
I think the effect on Superman he's not

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.889 
I think the effect on Superman he's not
it<00:02:00.299> is<00:02:00.950> deeply<00:02:01.950> difficult<00:02:02.579> decision<00:02:03.509> for<00:02:03.780> him

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
it is deeply difficult decision for him

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.660 
it is deeply difficult decision for him
to<00:02:03.929> make<00:02:04.140> you<00:02:04.619> know<00:02:04.740> he's<00:02:04.859> not<00:02:05.130> a<00:02:05.189> thing<00:02:05.520> that

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
to make you know he's not a thing that

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.889 
to make you know he's not a thing that
he<00:02:05.759> takes<00:02:05.999> lightly<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.450> you<00:02:06.539> could<00:02:06.659> see<00:02:06.810> it

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
he takes lightly and you could see it

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.889 
he takes lightly and you could see it
affects<00:02:07.259> him<00:02:07.469> pretty<00:02:08.130> profoundly<00:02:08.700> right<00:02:09.119> and

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
affects him pretty profoundly right and

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.559 
affects him pretty profoundly right and
maybe<00:02:10.200> we'll<00:02:10.470> see<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.120> repercussions<00:02:12.120> of

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
maybe we'll see the repercussions of

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.510 
maybe we'll see the repercussions of
that<00:02:12.750> in<00:02:12.930> the<00:02:13.020> next<00:02:13.260> film<00:02:13.440> like<00:02:13.800> how<00:02:14.340> that's

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
that in the next film like how that's

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.200 
that in the next film like how that's
affected<00:02:15.030> him<00:02:15.150> making<00:02:16.050> that<00:02:16.170> decision<00:02:16.440> right

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
affected him making that decision right

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.309 
affected him making that decision right
maybe<00:02:18.210> baby

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:19.319 
maybe baby

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.660 
maybe baby
you<00:02:19.770> who<00:02:20.069> wouldn't<00:02:20.250> know<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.610> don't<00:02:21.090> know

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
you who wouldn't know I don't know

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:23.700 
you who wouldn't know I don't know
ah
