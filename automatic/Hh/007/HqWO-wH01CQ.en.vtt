um i don't know if any of you guys have
heard<00:00:23.099> of<00:00:23.310> this<00:00:23.519> but<00:00:23.820> like<00:00:24.029> i<00:00:24.150> watch<00:00:24.359> dr.<00:00:24.720> oz<00:00:25.109> a

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
heard of this but like i watch dr. oz a

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:28.130 
heard of this but like i watch dr. oz a
lot<00:00:25.679> and<00:00:25.919> he<00:00:26.699> talks<00:00:26.909> about<00:00:27.029> how<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.480> is

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
lot and he talks about how this is

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.229 
lot and he talks about how this is
better<00:00:28.619> for<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> than<00:00:29.009> pasta<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.679> i<00:00:32.180> think<00:00:33.180> it

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
better for you than pasta and i think it

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
better for you than pasta and i think it
looks<00:00:33.390> pretty<00:00:33.480> cool<00:00:33.719> i<00:00:34.140> think<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:35.039> makes<00:00:35.219> it

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
looks pretty cool i think what makes it

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.349 
looks pretty cool i think what makes it
healthier<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.090> it<00:00:36.300> just<00:00:36.629> like<00:00:36.719> a<00:00:36.840> whole<00:00:37.199> green

00:00:38.349 --> 00:00:38.359 
healthier is it just like a whole green

00:00:38.359 --> 00:00:41.000 
healthier is it just like a whole green
right<00:00:39.359> there<00:00:39.600> it's<00:00:39.780> just<00:00:39.899> like<00:00:40.109> it's<00:00:40.890> an

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
right there it's just like it's an

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.330 
right there it's just like it's an
actual<00:00:41.219> grain<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.600> that's<00:00:42.840> pure<00:00:43.199> grain<00:00:43.530> so<00:00:44.309> i

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
actual grain like that's pure grain so i

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.400 
actual grain like that's pure grain so i
think<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.210> why<00:00:45.780> it's<00:00:45.960> healthier<00:00:46.260> it's

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
think that is why it's healthier it's

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.950 
think that is why it's healthier it's
not<00:00:46.530> processed<00:00:46.769> into<00:00:47.340> like<00:00:47.879> some<00:00:48.120> pasta<00:00:48.690> shape

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
not processed into like some pasta shape

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.200 
not processed into like some pasta shape
