game<00:00:22.199> why<00:00:23.070> not<00:00:23.220> enough<00:00:23.460> strategy<00:00:23.970> but<00:00:24.150> sort<00:00:24.539> of

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
game why not enough strategy but sort of

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.109 
game why not enough strategy but sort of
like<00:00:24.779> an<00:00:24.869> arcade<00:00:25.320> game<00:00:25.609> this<00:00:26.609> is<00:00:26.699> very<00:00:26.880> similar

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
like an arcade game this is very similar

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.250 
like an arcade game this is very similar
to<00:00:27.269> Tetris<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.680> okay<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:30.390> objective<00:00:30.990> is<00:00:31.080> you

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
to Tetris so okay the objective is you

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
to Tetris so okay the objective is you
basically<00:00:31.669> when<00:00:32.669> you<00:00:32.700> get<00:00:32.910> three<00:00:33.180> balls<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
basically when you get three balls the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.299 
basically when you get three balls the
same<00:00:33.750> color<00:00:33.989> you<00:00:34.290> click<00:00:34.500> on<00:00:34.590> it<00:00:34.739> and<00:00:34.829> they

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
same color you click on it and they

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.639 
same color you click on it and they
explode<00:00:35.640> so<00:00:36.390> let<00:00:36.570> me<00:00:36.630> just<00:00:36.750> even<00:00:37.020> find<00:00:37.350> some

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
explode so let me just even find some

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:38.930 
explode so let me just even find some
and<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.920> can<00:00:38.070> actually<00:00:38.190> move<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.610> balls

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
and you can actually move the balls

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.330 
and you can actually move the balls
around<00:00:39.379> you<00:00:40.379> know<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.680> that'll<00:00:41.010> help<00:00:41.100> you<00:00:41.219> out

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
around you know so that'll help you out

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.729 
around you know so that'll help you out
a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.640> and<00:00:42.110> just<00:00:43.110> like<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> you

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
a little bit and just like that you

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:46.279 
a little bit and just like that you
explode<00:00:44.309> the<00:00:44.700> pause<00:00:45.360> when<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.719> see<00:00:45.899> more<00:00:46.170> than

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
explode the pause when you see more than

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.630 
explode the pause when you see more than
three<00:00:46.559> 3<00:00:47.100> or<00:00:47.280> more<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:48.649> if<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.950> click<00:00:50.219> if

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
three 3 or more actually if you click if

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.970 
three 3 or more actually if you click if
you<00:00:51.270> like<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.289> that<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.680> three

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
you like this so you think that is three

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.369 
you like this so you think that is three
but<00:00:53.550> it's<00:00:53.640> really<00:00:53.760> not<00:00:53.969> you<00:00:54.960> see<00:00:55.110> you<00:00:55.230> get

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
but it's really not you see you get

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.189 
but it's really not you see you get
negative<00:00:55.500> point<00:00:56.149> so<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.539> game<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.690> pretty<00:00:57.870> fun

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
negative point so the game is pretty fun

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.349 
negative point so the game is pretty fun
