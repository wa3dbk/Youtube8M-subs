00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.069 
obviously you can fold up and down round
sell<00:03:31.760> and<00:03:32.269> that's<00:03:32.480> my<00:03:32.629> new<00:03:32.750> only<00:03:32.870> driven

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:33.079 
sell and that's my new only driven

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:35.619 
sell and that's my new only driven
mmm-hmm<00:03:33.980> it<00:03:34.670> just<00:03:34.879> gives<00:03:35.060> up<00:03:35.239> a<00:03:35.269> bit<00:03:35.390> more<00:03:35.540> of

00:03:35.619 --> 00:03:35.629 
mmm-hmm it just gives up a bit more of

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:36.520 
mmm-hmm it just gives up a bit more of
an<00:03:35.720> edge<00:03:35.810> to<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.109> car

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:36.530 
an edge to the car

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:39.009 
an edge to the car
I<00:03:37.430> like<00:03:37.670> that<00:03:37.819> so<00:03:38.000> it<00:03:38.150> will<00:03:38.269> go<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.569> and<00:03:38.750> down<00:03:38.870> on

00:03:39.009 --> 00:03:39.019 
I like that so it will go up and down on

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:40.960 
I like that so it will go up and down on
its<00:03:39.140> own<00:03:39.319> at<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.069> various<00:03:40.459> speed<00:03:40.700> that's

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
its own at the various speed that's

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.360 
its own at the various speed that's
right<00:03:41.239> yeah<00:03:41.510> but<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:41.930> can<00:03:42.200> actually<00:03:42.370> override

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
right yeah but I can actually override

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.210 
right yeah but I can actually override
it<00:03:43.760> press<00:03:44.209> it<00:03:44.390> you<00:03:44.599> can<00:03:45.049> look<00:03:45.170> Vince<00:03:45.680> downtown

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
it press it you can look Vince downtown

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.539 
it press it you can look Vince downtown
or<00:03:46.730> you<00:03:46.879> can<00:03:47.030> just<00:03:47.209> lay<00:03:48.019> it<00:03:48.170> low<00:03:48.349> maybe<00:03:48.859> bit

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
or you can just lay it low maybe bit

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.099 
or you can just lay it low maybe bit
sleeker<00:03:49.790> looking<00:03:50.090> you<00:03:50.359> can<00:03:50.390> just<00:03:50.659> go<00:03:50.780> steady

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
sleeker looking you can just go steady

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.410 
sleeker looking you can just go steady
