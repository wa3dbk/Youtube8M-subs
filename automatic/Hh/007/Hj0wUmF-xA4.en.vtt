to<00:03:24.680> find<00:03:24.860> out<00:03:25.130> that<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.370> wasn't<00:03:25.550> actually<00:03:26.270> has

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
to find out that it wasn't actually has

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.540 
to find out that it wasn't actually has
something<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.410> do<00:03:27.470> with<00:03:27.590> Lone<00:03:27.800> Ranger<00:03:28.040> and<00:03:28.340> the

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
something to do with Lone Ranger and the

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:29.949 
something to do with Lone Ranger and the
moving<00:03:28.850> of<00:03:28.940> pirates<00:03:29.360> and<00:03:29.510> things<00:03:29.660> like<00:03:29.780> and

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
moving of pirates and things like and

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.540 
moving of pirates and things like and
the<00:03:30.050> way<00:03:30.140> things<00:03:30.200> have<00:03:30.470> gone<00:03:30.500> lately<00:03:30.890> so

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
the way things have gone lately so

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.040 
the way things have gone lately so
that's<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:31.940> me<00:03:32.150> Erin<00:03:32.450> you<00:03:32.720> look<00:03:32.900> at<00:03:33.020> a

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050 
that's just me Erin you look at a

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.110 
that's just me Erin you look at a
situation<00:03:33.290> like<00:03:33.800> this<00:03:34.100> what<00:03:34.790> do<00:03:34.850> you<00:03:34.910> think<00:03:34.970> is

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
situation like this what do you think is

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.400 
situation like this what do you think is
really<00:03:35.300> going<00:03:35.330> on<00:03:35.510> behind<00:03:35.810> the<00:03:35.870> scenes<00:03:36.110> I

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:36.410 
really going on behind the scenes I

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.870 
really going on behind the scenes I
thought<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:36.860> exact<00:03:37.160> same<00:03:37.310> thing<00:03:37.580> that<00:03:37.610> you

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
thought the exact same thing that you

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.870 
thought the exact same thing that you
just<00:03:38.540> iterated<00:03:39.080> I<00:03:39.200> believe<00:03:39.620> that<00:03:39.650> it's<00:03:40.580> no

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:40.880 
just iterated I believe that it's no

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:42.880 
just iterated I believe that it's no
coincidence<00:03:41.120> that<00:03:41.630> this<00:03:41.840> is<00:03:41.989> happening<00:03:42.140> after

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:42.890 
coincidence that this is happening after

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.250 
coincidence that this is happening after
the<00:03:43.130> Lone<00:03:43.310> Ranger<00:03:43.550> which<00:03:44.030> was<00:03:44.270> a<00:03:44.510> box<00:03:45.050> office

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260 
the Lone Ranger which was a box office

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.120 
the Lone Ranger which was a box office
bomb<00:03:45.500> so<00:03:46.370> expensive<00:03:47.330> lost<00:03:48.020> the<00:03:48.170> studio<00:03:48.530> tons

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
bomb so expensive lost the studio tons

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:51.490 
bomb so expensive lost the studio tons
of<00:03:49.400> money<00:03:49.640> and<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:50.239> think<00:03:50.450> pretty<00:03:50.780> embarrassing

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
of money and I think pretty embarrassing

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.960 
of money and I think pretty embarrassing
for<00:03:51.770> most<00:03:51.920> of<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.070> people<00:03:52.340> involved<00:03:52.610> just

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
for most of the people involved just

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:54.550 
for most of the people involved just
based<00:03:53.480> on<00:03:53.600> the<00:03:53.720> way<00:03:53.810> they've<00:03:54.080> handled<00:03:54.110> this

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
based on the way they've handled this

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.530 
based on the way they've handled this
whole<00:03:54.739> situation<00:03:55.280> how<00:03:55.550> terrible<00:03:56.030> it<00:03:56.150> ended<00:03:56.420> up

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
whole situation how terrible it ended up

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.380 
whole situation how terrible it ended up
coming<00:03:56.930> out<00:03:57.310> and<00:03:58.310> for<00:03:58.700> the<00:03:59.090> one<00:03:59.239> of<00:03:59.330> the

00:03:59.380 --> 00:03:59.390 
coming out and for the one of the

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.580 
coming out and for the one of the
reasons<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.870> be<00:03:59.959> that<00:04:00.110> he<00:04:00.200> wants<00:04:00.380> to<00:04:00.410> produce

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590 
reasons to be that he wants to produce

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:02.440 
reasons to be that he wants to produce
more<00:04:00.709> adult<00:04:01.190> films<00:04:01.610> I<00:04:01.760> can<00:04:01.910> understand<00:04:02.360> that

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:02.450 
more adult films I can understand that

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.780 
more adult films I can understand that
but<00:04:02.570> I<00:04:02.750> also<00:04:02.989> feel<00:04:03.290> like<00:04:03.430> conair<00:04:04.430> and<00:04:04.580> the<00:04:04.640> rock

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
but I also feel like conair and the rock

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.660 
but I also feel like conair and the rock
were<00:04:04.970> pretty<00:04:05.180> adult<00:04:05.540> in<00:04:05.840> my<00:04:05.989> opinion<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:06.860> I

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
were pretty adult in my opinion and I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.540 
were pretty adult in my opinion and I
don't<00:04:08.300> know<00:04:08.690> how<00:04:08.930> edgy<00:04:09.709> Bruckheimer<00:04:10.160> wants<00:04:10.459> to

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
don't know how edgy Bruckheimer wants to

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.699 
don't know how edgy Bruckheimer wants to
get<00:04:10.700> so<00:04:10.880> I<00:04:10.940> don't<00:04:11.150> buy<00:04:11.360> that<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.840> one<00:04:12.410> of<00:04:12.560> the

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:12.709 
get so I don't buy that is one of the

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:15.040 
get so I don't buy that is one of the
most<00:04:12.980> legitimate<00:04:13.400> reasons<00:04:13.940> behind<00:04:14.180> making

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
most legitimate reasons behind making

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:16.390 
most legitimate reasons behind making
this<00:04:15.320> split<00:04:15.650> and<00:04:15.769> not<00:04:15.890> renewing<00:04:16.310> this

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
this split and not renewing this

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.699 
this split and not renewing this
contract<00:04:16.459> so<00:04:17.269> I<00:04:17.480> think<00:04:17.959> they'll<00:04:18.109> both<00:04:18.260> be<00:04:18.290> fine

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:18.709 
contract so I think they'll both be fine

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.039 
contract so I think they'll both be fine
I<00:04:19.040> think<00:04:19.640> though<00:04:19.790> Disney's<00:04:20.570> gonna<00:04:20.780> be<00:04:20.870> fine

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
I think though Disney's gonna be fine

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.480 
I think though Disney's gonna be fine
Bruckheimer's<00:04:21.799> going<00:04:21.950> to<00:04:22.010> be<00:04:22.070> fine<00:04:22.250> they're

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
Bruckheimer's going to be fine they're

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:25.050 
Bruckheimer's going to be fine they're
both<00:04:22.700> super<00:04:23.330> great<00:04:23.690> but<00:04:23.960> at<00:04:24.020> the<00:04:24.140> same<00:04:24.320> time

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
both super great but at the same time

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.879 
both super great but at the same time
I<00:04:25.120> think<00:04:25.480> this<00:04:25.600> has<00:04:25.780> a<00:04:25.810> lot<00:04:25.990> to<00:04:26.230> do<00:04:26.380> with<00:04:26.410> Lone

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889 
I think this has a lot to do with Lone

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:29.460 
I think this has a lot to do with Lone
Ranger<00:04:27.130> yeah<00:04:27.700> and<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.210> don't<00:04:28.389> want<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.630> I<00:04:28.810> think

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
Ranger yeah and I don't want to I think

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.020 
Ranger yeah and I don't want to I think
I'm<00:04:29.560> being<00:04:29.710> guilty<00:04:30.100> here<00:04:30.310> of<00:04:30.430> glossing<00:04:31.030> over

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
I'm being guilty here of glossing over

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.240 
I'm being guilty here of glossing over
what<00:04:31.660> their<00:04:31.810> official<00:04:32.500> reason<00:04:32.740> being<00:04:33.040> given

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
what their official reason being given

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.490 
what their official reason being given
is<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.760> touched<00:04:34.360> on<00:04:34.510> it<00:04:34.660> right<00:04:34.810> the<00:04:35.260> idea

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
is you touched on it right the idea

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.690 
is you touched on it right the idea
about<00:04:35.650> Bruckheimer<00:04:36.130> wants<00:04:36.280> to<00:04:36.370> do<00:04:36.460> some<00:04:36.610> more
