00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.350
 Hello and welcome to the Friday edition of GameStar TV 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.180
 unbelievable but true that actually since 1998 namely the Emergency 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.300
 Row and Stefan Vortag the greatest joy are now my studio he Alba 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.560
 have you the latest part of the survey Samoa Location 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.960
 and 5 but what if it is the church 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.160
 what you look at the thing is called in Germany sees 20 12 or 2012 has 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.910
 that in some reason now for the first time press question why 20 12 because then the 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:35.720
 World goes down 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.850
 that means no matter that can be explained there is a sensation Emmerich 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.320
 For example, years after the unit remains declared Gameiro feverishly 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.079
 Game but it is not so official is the world goes down 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.850
 whether detail catastrophes let keyword be delivered 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.850
 it's not like they're in front anymore 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.900
 With Roger coming home keeper on the tooth index GI percent falls out of the 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.500
 Bed or sale-and-lease-back this year is really about disaster areas 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.699
 in these scenarios, it hurts in the preliminary talk 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:06.910
 around that cities 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.469
 So you have Brands Narayen 

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:13.439
 what the landslide intel macs so the Matterhorn comes down in Berlin 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.200
 turned 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.149
 there would be no more fire the fire brigade as ruling 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.639
 burning through under the linden trees from level domains to civil wars that is 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:24.909
 all at a very high level so in fact it really is the son one 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:29.340
 Designer I Story Ajar 2005 Great Power Book which or by itself 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.480
 think 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.130
 it is a kind of rescue team relation or 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.509
 yes, so you are playing 

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:40.899
 Erwin s had i had to say thank you then hear from then 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.590
 above almost typical types of troops 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.999
 Police and paramedics 

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:49.179
 Tennis Relief and Percent Fire Brigades artists like that they blue that he 

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.420
 blue Renault to send the assistants animals to the engineer 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 under then must just depending on what is currently incurred just the people 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.590
 saving different ways that means you have to have one you have 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.240
 this percent of major accident he so to speak last year must first 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.320
 I now need to analyze this and where I need it 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.729
 People know them now 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.820
 it is OK so if for example only protect injuries Italy yes 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:14.520
 In addition to that count an emergency doctor who will finish the transport 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.560
 Transportation more important then the paramedics come to our customers okay but 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.270
 that her child is a simple one he worked all at the same time 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:25.120
 Most of the time, these paramedics customers will culminate their episode police 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.670
 culminate and must also be careful that the paramedics Japan come in two 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.770
 other songs that have to be said injured and injured by two hits 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.480
 that he himself gives the way, but that is what he is 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.010
 Opinion if he is powerless 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.010
 so it is 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.900
 Markham parents have left and therefore time pressure because especially if the 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.510
 Fire roller rolls up Muezzin customer so a goal is just getting out and 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.590
 At the same time, the Kurhaus will replace such winterly ones if you then 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.400
 Hands for those who do not want to know then widen in the meantime 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.029
 pretty fierce okay 

00:02:56.029 --> 00:02:57.269
 Percent e 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:01.049
 how should I imagine this is now there and then have sun and Festes 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.590
 Contingent or + technology gradually recovering from my groups Sch am I 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.990
 for example, because it's up 

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:09.700
 that means you will as always think 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.340
 that was i have more vehicles or anything else so in the hottest of all 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.309
 of the twelve there 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:19.019
 did you think I use bird flu finished in the middle of the mountains finished grandma 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.969
 other units that are not enlarged 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.200
 In the free game is different because you get to apply but good for his rescue 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.789
 several 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:30.689
 working has to make money the culprit still could not pass and size 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.619
 Vehicles and so on m Jan Voigt you have free play that is so percent 

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.009
 this is perfect for the whole city of Frankfurt and it's just more and more 

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:39.019
 Google gives 

00:03:39.019 --> 00:03:43.000
 that is, the potential yes exactly Sep in the beginning, he must get brawl 

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.180
 the police then go elsewhere is the police Turkey roundabout Pepe El 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.519
 Gallo one for trouble 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:50.500
 then it should get on then so on 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.790
 the tone of voice 

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:53.900
 Schoolgirl an hour through fur coat 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.770
 then be pretty lumbering that are a thousand things Euphoria sausage and 

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:01.550
 im deciding what i do warm so thats not especially applicants 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:06.090
 really look which uniform where and when okay that Xing after one 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.159
 but she is no longer my readers 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:10.829
 Strengthening slalom runners 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.900
 such as the Wiener Neustadt January so clearly counted at StarCraft 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.889
 Human life and say 2 2 or where this explained Rhine 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.099
 some people are also human content Herthaner in the rest that 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:25.730
 not good if I may say so 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.770
 So thought that's actually one 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:31.999
 the iron will is not so much attention from now 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.990
 Golf the state elections 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.910
 the earth on »says Husterer game it is probably going to 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:41.620
 be amazed when you see the backpressure looks like 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:45.560
 that's it for people around them do not want to name as development is one 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:46.759
 Complete revision 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.259
 that really has pretty much all the effects you know so patience 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:49.910
 to practice 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:51.280
 Banks had and so on 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:54.650
 All of that can be found quite nicely on both sides is so stuck with 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:56.150
 Players 5 1-win Opel 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.090
 from what you want to get from a catchy one 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.349
 Reach control 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:04.610
 accordingly the normal exotic things responds had accordingly the percent 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:10.059
 as he succeeds again at no other than the small car in 

00:05:10.059 --> 00:05:12.119
 Projects of the community apply 

00:05:12.119 --> 00:05:15.029
 and it could indeed be an act of getting into a big one 

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:18.289
 Paramedic will be career for years as Arnie as we all do 

00:05:18.289 --> 00:05:21.960
 know the entry into the pension while the done made done 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.270
 each partner 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.089
 m 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:26.000
 how long have you been at that? 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.970
 I do not know how long they have developed but we are still about 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:31.870
 could be imprisoned for three months that would be the next question 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.760
 being 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.870
 Dr 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:36.760
 who is not the perfect Christmas present so i believe that 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.160
 is such a thing where now a small circle of Breitenbach not on 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.990
 and always 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.120
 and around 1 80 percent 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.710
 here Treasure Emergency 20 12 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.030
 and now this country will certainly not win any good looking at it 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:50.400
 is a live rabbit 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.160
 Uder specific there are so within the general I have not 

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:54.639
 noticed 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:58.450
 It could be that banks in times of crisis, of course, not so 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:05:59.030
 too early 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.930
 but one of the not laid out by the game mechanics he 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:07.150
 these were Makarenko play or play in other social group and then 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:09.990
 and again something constant points 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:14.160
 and around Vettel though to work together with other people in the city center 

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.590
 are the paper but you can change it I am hurt had Steiner 

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.410
 then percent Daimler Chrysler 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:20.639
 has been common 

00:06:20.639 --> 00:06:23.219
 Morning will therefore appeal to everyone 

00:06:23.219 --> 00:06:27.159
 yes okay cool but that's a German production "Maybe you would have 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:29.929
 Also to say that it is not from Quadriga Games if they are from Berlin 

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:34.759
 Tegel are in Potsdam the Babelsberger blessed city therefore facts GEA 

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:39.219
 yes exactly in the case is then as before with at least 20 12 who 

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:42.750
 Champions together percent of the next week's raffle by Minister 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:46.650
 Penultimate week and percent ask the question for next week the latter 

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:50.290
 wanted DAX is Jan Schneider and I know how much more will the Shanghai 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:51.759
 World Financial Center 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:55.689
 as the one who goes right next to it in Mauro mourning is all that is exactly one 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:06:59.310
 make clear methane knew that among others is the Philipp Preuss 

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.030
 live from big Eifel life and you come as brings taxes 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.550
 and the fantastic implicitly coined 

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.279
 what depresses him 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:11.989
 Well, all the new question for the coming week is the doer as follows 

00:07:11.989 --> 00:07:15.619
 from Emergency 20 12 this is the stimulus floor 

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:19.549
 is this a completely different game known that is relatively soon that 

00:07:19.549 --> 00:07:23.410
 not from 1991 I can do that as a toddler by itself 

00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:26.910
 The safety vests game is called "If you have the right solution to the game 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:29.950
 then send in full-name and full-address addresses 

00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:33.930
 you can do that all the camera without work m so let's do it all the time 

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:38.000
 open one year that's not right bothered Bon's love long sleeve 

00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.050
 percent 

00:07:39.050 --> 00:07:40.389
 yes we have once 

00:07:40.389 --> 00:07:43.199
 which books may the city council have 

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:45.310
 Then we have one typical 

00:07:45.310 --> 00:07:49.429
 Seeger state television Fachwart with percent grow TEG 

00:07:49.429 --> 00:07:50.880
 obviously exactly 

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.350
 and then also Otten Korte have the Modern Warfare 2 Switzerland giving away that 

00:07:55.350 --> 00:07:59.450
 There is not a single person for this totally hot summer 

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.330
 so well dressed 

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:04.659
 the wars for this week as I said that he was not at me here so far 

00:08:04.659 --> 00:08:07.870
 See you again next week that we were always »enjoyable 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:08.160
 play
