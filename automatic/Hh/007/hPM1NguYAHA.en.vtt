00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
detail now this is kind of hard because

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.540 
detail now this is kind of hard because
the<00:00:55.140> two<00:00:55.320> phones<00:00:55.590> serve<00:00:56.219> different<00:00:56.399> purposes

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
and do different things but if we kick

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.540 
and do different things but if we kick
off<00:00:59.579> with<00:00:59.760> design<00:01:00.239> then<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:01.109> s5<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.100> premium

generally speaking on the s5 this is

s5<00:04:51.870> you<00:04:52.080> look<00:04:52.200> at<00:04:52.289> about<00:04:52.440> sixty<00:04:52.800> seven<00:04:53.100> hours

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
s5 you look at about sixty seven hours

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.820 
s5 you look at about sixty seven hours
but<00:04:53.640> you<00:04:53.729> get<00:04:53.880> about<00:04:54.060> six<00:04:54.450> hours<00:04:54.720> more<00:04:55.440> talk

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.690 

so<00:05:07.150> overall<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.870> galaxy<00:05:08.380> s5<00:05:09.040> is<00:05:09.310> a<00:05:09.400> better

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700 
so overall the galaxy s5 is a better

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.760 
so overall the galaxy s5 is a better
phone<00:05:09.970> from<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.360> software<00:05:10.810> and<00:05:10.990> a<00:05:11.320> hardware

phone from a software and a hardware

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.130 
phone from a software and a hardware
perspective<00:05:11.950> you'd<00:05:12.850> expect<00:05:12.940> that<00:05:13.420> given<00:05:13.930> the

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.140 
perspective you'd expect that given the

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:16.290 
perspective you'd expect that given the
high<00:05:14.320> price<00:05:14.710> point<00:05:15.100> it's<00:05:15.550> also<00:05:15.700> extremely

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
high price point it's also extremely

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.420 
high price point it's also extremely
robust<00:05:17.290> but<00:05:18.480> the<00:05:19.480> a5<00:05:20.020> is<00:05:20.320> a<00:05:20.500> mid-range<00:05:21.040> phone

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:21.430 
robust but the a5 is a mid-range phone

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:24.270 
robust but the a5 is a mid-range phone
and<00:05:21.730> therefore<00:05:22.120> quite<00:05:22.420> a<00:05:22.480> lot<00:05:22.930> cheaper<00:05:23.740> and<00:05:24.010> it

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
and therefore quite a lot cheaper and it

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.760 
and therefore quite a lot cheaper and it
looks<00:05:24.580> great<00:05:24.910> and<00:05:25.120> feels<00:05:25.660> great<00:05:26.110> in<00:05:26.320> your<00:05:26.500> hand

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770 
looks great and feels great in your hand

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.120 
looks great and feels great in your hand
it's<00:05:27.190> also<00:05:27.400> going<00:05:27.910> to<00:05:28.000> let<00:05:28.180> you<00:05:28.330> nail<00:05:28.720> that

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
it's also going to let you nail that

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.620 
it's also going to let you nail that
all-important<00:05:30.130> selfie<00:05:30.610> and<00:05:30.760> then<00:05:31.180> look<00:05:31.390> at<00:05:31.480> it

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:31.630 
all-important selfie and then look at it

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.070 
all-important selfie and then look at it
back<00:05:31.840> on<00:05:32.110> a<00:05:32.170> fantastic<00:05:33.070> screen<00:05:33.880> so<00:05:34.630> I<00:05:34.660> suppose

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
back on a fantastic screen so I suppose

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.380 
back on a fantastic screen so I suppose
it<00:05:35.350> really<00:05:35.530> depends<00:05:36.160> what<00:05:36.400> you<00:05:36.520> want<00:05:36.760> if<00:05:37.270> you

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.390 
it really depends what you want if you

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:39.960 
it really depends what you want if you
want<00:05:37.540> an<00:05:37.630> absolutely<00:05:38.260> top<00:05:38.650> end<00:05:38.920> handset<00:05:39.490> with

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
all that that entails that can also

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.590 
all that that entails that can also
stand<00:05:42.310> up<00:05:42.490> to<00:05:42.610> a<00:05:42.640> bit<00:05:42.820> of<00:05:42.850> rough<00:05:43.120> and<00:05:43.270> tumble
