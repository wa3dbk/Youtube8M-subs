00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:02.188
 Huh? What is it? 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:06.108
 Enter. 

00:00:14.917 --> 00:00:18.087
 What is this complaint from the housekeeping department? 

00:00:21.958 --> 00:00:24.127
 It's a complaint about a guest who has lost something. 

00:00:24.127 --> 00:00:26.796
 Is not this the VIP guest of our hotel? 

00:00:26.796 --> 00:00:29.799
 How can this kind of thing happen in our VIP room? 

00:00:29.799 --> 00:00:31.567
 What does the housekeeping department say? 

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.903
 They seek the object themselves. 

00:00:33.903 --> 00:00:36.472
 There are no strangers coming in and going out? 

00:00:36.472 --> 00:00:38.341
 Was not an employee on duty taking it? 

00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.876
 Team leader Yang thought so too. 

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:42.511
 She wants to punish this employee. 

00:00:42.678 --> 00:00:44.113
 But... 

00:00:44.113 --> 00:00:45.982
 What's the matter? 

00:00:45.982 --> 00:00:48.084
 The top said that because we are not sure. 

00:00:48.084 --> 00:00:51.387
 If the employee is responsible So it's up to the police to punish him. 

00:00:51.387 --> 00:00:53.756
 He wants to investigate himself. 

00:00:53.756 --> 00:00:54.991
 And then punish him accordingly. 

00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:56.492
 The Top? 

00:00:56.492 --> 00:00:58.327
 Who is it? 

00:00:58.628 --> 00:00:59.762
 It is... 

00:00:59.762 --> 00:01:00.930
 The manager of the responsible person? 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.964
 No. 

00:01:01.964 --> 00:01:04.266
 Said most clearly! 

00:01:04.567 --> 00:01:05.701
 Who is it? 

00:01:05.701 --> 00:01:07.603
 It's the Park manager. 

00:01:08.104 --> 00:01:09.338
 What? 

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:10.773
 Manager Park? 

00:01:10.773 --> 00:01:12.608
 That's it. 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.879
 Who was the good in service? 

00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:20.316
 It was Miss Jang Sa Ya. 

00:01:20.316 --> 00:01:22.618
 Jang Sa Ya? 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.924
 Enough. Outside. 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.668
 Manager Lee. 

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:40.336
 Oh ! Why did you come here? 

00:01:40.336 --> 00:01:42.338
 I go to the spa with mom. 

00:01:42.338 --> 00:01:43.339
 Oh okay. 

00:01:43.339 --> 00:01:45.041
 But I do not know if she's free. 

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.575
 What? 

00:01:47.243 --> 00:01:50.479
 I ask you because I think I have already heard that name. 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:52.248
 Did you hear that name: Jang Sa Ya? 

00:01:52.248 --> 00:01:53.816
 Jang Sa Ya? 

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:56.285
 I heard it before. 

00:01:56.285 --> 00:01:57.853
 Where did I hear it before? 

00:01:57.853 --> 00:01:59.689
 I think it has something to do with brother-in-law. 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.323
 Jae Woo? 

00:02:01.924 --> 00:02:03.226
 Oh I see. 

00:02:03.226 --> 00:02:05.361
 Was not it the child who wanted to find his father? 

00:02:05.361 --> 00:02:07.496
 I even asked for help from your sister-in-law. 

00:02:07.496 --> 00:02:10.599
 Ah, that's why this name seemed familiar to me. 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.367
 Why? 

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:12.802
 What about Jang Sa Ya? 

00:02:12.802 --> 00:02:15.204
 Nice brother said there is a girl he loves, is not it? 

00:02:15.604 --> 00:02:17.673
 I think it's her. 

00:02:17.673 --> 00:02:19.374
 what did you say? 

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:24.380
 No way. Not lost at this point! 

00:02:24.714 --> 00:02:27.617
 Jae Woo has principles. Not possible. 

00:02:27.617 --> 00:02:30.253

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:32.521
 Educated in a boarding school. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.769
 Yes, aunt. It's me. 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.605
 I was just wondering what you were doing recently. 

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.907
 Where did you sleep yesterday? 

00:02:52.642 --> 00:02:54.443
 In a hotel room. 

00:02:54.443 --> 00:02:56.679
 Can you sleep there? 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.349
 Ahjusshi says I can use an unoccupied room. 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.018
 No need to worry about where I live at the moment. 

00:03:03.018 --> 00:03:05.554
 Do not let your guard down just because someone is kind to you. 

00:03:05.554 --> 00:03:08.524
 Women need to be more cautious 

00:03:08.524 --> 00:03:10.592
 I can believe in ahjusshi. 

00:03:11.494 --> 00:03:15.931
 Honestly, something bad happened yesterday. 

00:03:16.232 --> 00:03:18.567
 What? What was it? 

00:03:20.636 --> 00:03:23.672
 I'll tell you next time we meet. 

00:03:23.672 --> 00:03:27.743
 Okay. If it becomes more difficult, you have to endure it a little. 

00:03:27.743 --> 00:03:32.081
 Thinking of your father, you must continue to live a good and clean life. 

00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:35.884
 Ok. Ok. I hang up. 

00:03:38.154 --> 00:03:38.888
 Ahjumma!

 I have to give you your change. 

00:03:39.955 --> 00:03:41.423
 Oh.

 Thank you. 

00:03:42.357 --> 00:03:43.057
 Goodbye. 

00:03:43.057 --> 00:03:44.093
 Yes! 

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.730
