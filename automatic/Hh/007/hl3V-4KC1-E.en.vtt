marks<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.360> how<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:45.540> film<00:01:45.810> would<00:01:45.960> perform<00:01:46.350> with

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
marks to how the film would perform with

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.889 
marks to how the film would perform with
them<00:01:46.590> starring<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.430> then<00:01:47.850> stop<00:01:48.360> off<00:01:48.570> sorry

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
them starring and then stop off sorry

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.530 
them starring and then stop off sorry
Battlestar<00:01:49.740> Galactica<00:01:50.340> fans<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.390> just

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
Battlestar Galactica fans but it's just

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.569 
Battlestar Galactica fans but it's just
taken<00:01:51.899> her<00:01:51.990> too<00:01:52.200> long<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.740> legitimately<00:01:53.340> make

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
taken her too long to legitimately make

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.249 
taken her too long to legitimately make
the<00:01:53.729> leap<00:01:53.909> from<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.450> small<00:01:54.689> screen<00:01:54.720> to<00:01:55.110> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
the leap from the small screen to the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.600 
the leap from the small screen to the
big<00:01:55.439> screen<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.799> mean<00:01:55.920> she's<00:01:56.100> been<00:01:56.250> like<00:01:56.490> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
big screen I mean she's been like in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.569 
big screen I mean she's been like in
that<00:01:56.729> most<00:01:57.570> recent<00:01:57.899> Riddick<00:01:58.200> film<00:01:58.469> and<00:01:58.740> little

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
that most recent Riddick film and little

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
that most recent Riddick film and little
things<00:01:59.729> like<00:01:59.850> that<00:02:00.240> but<00:02:00.509> I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:00.960> she's<00:02:01.290> still

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
things like that but I think she's still

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.440 
things like that but I think she's still
overall<00:02:01.829> a<00:02:02.159> small<00:02:02.460> screen<00:02:02.759> Talent

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
overall a small screen Talent

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.380 
overall a small screen Talent
so<00:02:04.170> here<00:02:04.350> comes<00:02:04.560> Ferguson<00:02:05.280> who<00:02:06.030> would<00:02:06.210> perhaps

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
so here comes Ferguson who would perhaps

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.169 
so here comes Ferguson who would perhaps
be<00:02:06.780> just<00:02:07.350> fresh<00:02:07.680> enough<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.220> new<00:02:08.340> enough<00:02:08.670> to

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
be just fresh enough and new enough to

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.880 
be just fresh enough and new enough to
give<00:02:09.330> Captain<00:02:09.869> Marvel<00:02:10.140> a<00:02:10.289> fighting<00:02:10.619> chance

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
give Captain Marvel a fighting chance

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
give Captain Marvel a fighting chance
and<00:02:11.580> now<00:02:11.849> she's<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.150> little<00:02:12.360> bit<00:02:12.599> different

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
and now she's a little bit different

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.089 
and now she's a little bit different
little<00:02:13.239> quieter<00:02:13.840> than<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.500> spunky

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
little quieter than the spunky

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:17.369 
little quieter than the spunky

also in Mission Impossible rogue nation
she<00:02:56.110> plays<00:02:56.349> a<00:02:56.620> good<00:02:56.829> spy<00:02:57.160> spy<00:02:57.700> who<00:02:57.760> is<00:02:58.629> very

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
she plays a good spy spy who is very

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:00.539 
she plays a good spy spy who is very
competent<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.650> able<00:02:59.709> to<00:02:59.950> do<00:03:00.129> what<00:03:00.250> she<00:03:00.400> needs

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
good member of a team which I think are

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.780 
good member of a team which I think are
not<00:03:04.810> only<00:03:05.079> good<00:03:05.500> assets<00:03:06.220> for<00:03:06.430> anyone<00:03:06.670> who's

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:06.790 
not only good assets for anyone who's

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.850 
not only good assets for anyone who's
gonna<00:03:06.910> be<00:03:07.180> part<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.510> like<00:03:07.720> the<00:03:07.870> Avengers<00:03:08.170> but

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
gonna be part of like the Avengers but

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:10.979 
gonna be part of like the Avengers but
also<00:03:09.010> someone<00:03:09.400> who's<00:03:09.519> a<00:03:09.549> military<00:03:10.269> person

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
also someone who's a military person

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:13.170 
also someone who's a military person
such<00:03:11.620> as<00:03:11.650> Carol<00:03:12.310> Danvers<00:03:12.700> who<00:03:12.849> of<00:03:12.940> course<00:03:12.970> is

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
such as Carol Danvers who of course is

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.330 
such as Carol Danvers who of course is
an<00:03:13.390> Air<00:03:13.510> Force<00:03:13.690> pilot<00:03:14.019> so<00:03:14.709> I<00:03:14.739> think<00:03:14.890> that<00:03:15.190> even

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
an Air Force pilot so I think that even

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.009 
an Air Force pilot so I think that even
though<00:03:15.549> she<00:03:15.610> again<00:03:16.060> is<00:03:16.269> different<00:03:16.810> than<00:03:16.930> the

00:03:17.009 --> 00:03:17.019 
though she again is different than the

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:18.449 
though she again is different than the
way<00:03:17.109> the<00:03:17.230> characters<00:03:17.620> was<00:03:17.799> recently<00:03:18.340> been

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
way the characters was recently been

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.940 
way the characters was recently been
depicted<00:03:18.730> in<00:03:18.940> the<00:03:19.030> comics<00:03:19.480> I<00:03:19.690> think<00:03:20.200> she<00:03:20.440> is<00:03:20.650> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
depicted in the comics I think she is a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.890 
depicted in the comics I think she is a
good<00:03:21.250> direction<00:03:21.579> for<00:03:21.730> the<00:03:21.940> film<00:03:22.269> version<00:03:22.359> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
good direction for the film version of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.500 
good direction for the film version of
Carol<00:03:23.139> Danvers<00:03:23.650> aka<00:03:23.829> Captain<00:03:24.340> Marvel<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:25.329> go

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel to go

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.349 
Carol Danvers aka Captain Marvel to go
it<00:03:25.690> so<00:03:26.290> that's<00:03:26.650> one<00:03:27.040> wrap<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.549> other<00:03:27.730> route<00:03:28.150> of

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
it so that's one wrap the other route of

and<00:04:24.120> for<00:04:24.420> instance<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.200> catch<00:04:25.410> a<00:04:25.590> thief<00:04:25.620> and<00:04:26.130> I

and for instance to catch a thief and I

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.129 
and for instance to catch a thief and I
think<00:04:26.820> that<00:04:26.970> if<00:04:27.150> you<00:04:27.270> look<00:04:27.450> back<00:04:27.630> to<00:04:27.810> Batman

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:28.139 
think that if you look back to Batman

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:29.600 
think that if you look back to Batman
the<00:04:28.290> Animated<00:04:28.320> Series<00:04:28.710> that's<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.430> version

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
the Animated Series that's the version

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:31.370 
the Animated Series that's the version
of<00:04:29.790> Selina<00:04:30.060> Kyle<00:04:30.300> they<00:04:30.480> went<00:04:30.660> with<00:04:30.750> their<00:04:30.960> and

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
of Selina Kyle they went with their and

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.110 
of Selina Kyle they went with their and
I<00:04:31.440> think<00:04:31.650> it<00:04:31.740> was<00:04:31.860> very<00:04:32.190> effective<00:04:32.669> it<00:04:33.030> would

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:33.120 
I think it was very effective it would

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.280 
I think it was very effective it would
be<00:04:33.210> a<00:04:33.240> little<00:04:33.510> bit<00:04:33.600> of<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.750> different<00:04:34.050> route<00:04:34.169> to

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:34.290 
be a little bit of a different route to

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.020 
be a little bit of a different route to
go<00:04:34.410> with<00:04:34.500> the<00:04:34.620> character<00:04:35.010> but<00:04:35.430> again<00:04:35.669> I<00:04:35.910> think

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
go with the character but again I think

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.580 
go with the character but again I think
it<00:04:36.270> would<00:04:36.330> be<00:04:36.450> very<00:04:36.660> successful<00:04:36.960> and<00:04:37.500> I<00:04:37.560> think

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
it would be very successful and I think

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.340 
it would be very successful and I think
the<00:04:37.860> Ben<00:04:38.010> Affleck<00:04:38.370> would<00:04:39.330> play<00:04:39.510> very<00:04:39.960> well<00:04:40.080> off

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
the Ben Affleck would play very well off

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.810 
the Ben Affleck would play very well off
of<00:04:40.530> Rebecca<00:04:40.830> Ferguson<00:04:41.070> and<00:04:41.430> he<00:04:41.490> does<00:04:41.669> of

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:46.710 
that he's working on with Geoff Johns so

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:48.110 
that he's working on with Geoff Johns so
those<00:04:46.889> are<00:04:47.070> the<00:04:47.130> two<00:04:47.310> directions<00:04:47.790> right<00:04:47.970> now

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.610 
those are the two directions right now
that<00:04:48.330> she<00:04:48.480> could<00:04:48.630> go<00:04:48.750> and<00:04:48.900> Fox<00:04:49.200> could<00:04:49.470> always

that she could go and Fox could always

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.140 
that she could go and Fox could always
jump<00:04:50.010> in<00:04:50.130> there<00:04:50.310> and<00:04:50.340> snap<00:04:50.730> her<00:04:50.880> up<00:04:50.970> for

jump in there and snap her up for

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.330 
jump in there and snap her up for
something<00:04:51.419> else<00:04:51.600> so<00:04:52.200> I'm<00:04:52.320> curious<00:04:52.560> who<00:04:53.190> are

Ferguson<00:05:20.760> and<00:05:21.210> I<00:05:21.300> I<00:05:21.330> think<00:05:21.570> that<00:05:21.870> she's<00:05:22.020> one<00:05:22.139> of

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:22.200 
Ferguson and I I think that she's one of

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.260 
Ferguson and I I think that she's one of
the<00:05:22.290> most<00:05:22.440> likable<00:05:22.680> female<00:05:23.250> action<00:05:23.910> starts<00:05:24.180> to

the most likable female action starts to

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.600 
the most likable female action starts to
come<00:05:24.389> along<00:05:24.600> a<00:05:24.630> long<00:05:24.900> time<00:05:25.229> and<00:05:25.610> potentially

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:26.610 
come along a long time and potentially

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:28.580 
come along a long time and potentially
at<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.940> level<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.330> maybe<00:05:27.570> like<00:05:27.870> an<00:05:28.260> alan

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
at the level of maybe like an alan

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:31.250 
at the level of maybe like an alan
ripley<00:05:28.950> because<00:05:29.520> you<00:05:29.760> know<00:05:29.880> not<00:05:30.210> sassy<00:05:30.840> not
