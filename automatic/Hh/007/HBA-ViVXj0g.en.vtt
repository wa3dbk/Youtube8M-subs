00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
the tournaments but most naturally most

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.529 
the tournaments but most naturally most
beginners<00:00:26.160> they<00:00:26.430> like<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.699> try<00:00:26.849> tournament<00:00:27.330> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
beginners they like to try tournament so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.910 
beginners they like to try tournament so
I<00:00:27.810> know<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:28.019> entered<00:00:28.380> some<00:00:28.529> tournaments<00:00:28.859> like

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
I know I entered some tournaments like

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.189 
I know I entered some tournaments like
five<00:00:29.130> dollar<00:00:29.310> tree<00:00:29.490> mats<00:00:29.670> whatever<00:00:30.019> loss<00:00:31.019> of

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
five dollar tree mats whatever loss of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.440 
five dollar tree mats whatever loss of
all<00:00:31.320> those<00:00:31.560> but<00:00:32.099> eventually<00:00:32.279> i<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.390> was

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
all those but eventually i think it was

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.030 
all those but eventually i think it was
like<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.600> fifty-dollar<00:00:34.110> tournament<00:00:34.590> i<00:00:34.649> decide

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
like a fifty-dollar tournament i decide

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.000 
like a fifty-dollar tournament i decide
to<00:00:35.219> enter<00:00:35.309> take<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> big<00:00:36.059> shot<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.960> i<00:00:37.680> got<00:00:37.860> like

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
to enter take a big shot and i got like

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.100 
to enter take a big shot and i got like
second<00:00:38.460> place<00:00:38.640> one<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> few<00:00:39.450> thousand<00:00:39.989> and

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
second place one a few thousand and

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.319 
second place one a few thousand and
that's<00:00:40.230> kind<00:00:40.410> of<00:00:40.440> when<00:00:40.649> my<00:00:40.950> bankroll<00:00:41.790> started

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
that's kind of when my bankroll started

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.080 
that's kind of when my bankroll started
so<00:00:42.870> i<00:00:42.899> had<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> role<00:00:43.320> to<00:00:43.350> like<00:00:43.739> play<00:00:44.040> low<00:00:44.579> stakes

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
so i had a role to like play low stakes

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.119 
so i had a role to like play low stakes
cash<00:00:45.329> games<00:00:45.660> like<00:00:45.960> fifty<00:00:46.440> dollar<00:00:46.559> bonds<00:00:46.860> or

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
cash games like fifty dollar bonds or

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.819 
cash games like fifty dollar bonds or
