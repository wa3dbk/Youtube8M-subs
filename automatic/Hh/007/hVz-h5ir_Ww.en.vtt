00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
wrap it around itself like that but make

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.530 
wrap it around itself like that but make
sure<00:02:19.000> it's<00:02:19.390> still<00:02:19.720> nice<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.410> twisted<00:02:21.540> you

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
sure it's still nice and twisted you

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:26.010 
sure it's still nice and twisted you
always<00:02:23.140> add<00:02:23.530> more<00:02:24.040> twists<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.700> when<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.810> go

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:26.020

around<00:02:26.170> your<00:02:26.680> little<00:02:27.010> bomb<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.610> guess<00:02:28.290> so<00:02:29.290> it's

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
around your little bomb I guess so it's

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.930 
around your little bomb I guess so it's
like<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:29.800> and<00:02:30.540> then<00:02:31.540> you<00:02:31.660> hold<00:02:31.960> it<00:02:32.760> take<00:02:33.760> your

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
like that and then you hold it take your

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.640 
like that and then you hold it take your
hair<00:02:34.210> tie<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:36.010> tie<00:02:36.910> it<00:02:36.970> off<00:02:37.200> you're<00:02:38.200> gonna<00:02:38.440> be

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
hair tie and tie it off you're gonna be

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.680 
hair tie and tie it off you're gonna be
able<00:02:38.800> to<00:02:39.010> sleep<00:02:39.250> on<00:02:39.520> this<00:02:39.640> I<00:02:39.820> think<00:02:39.940> it's<00:02:40.450> not

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
able to sleep on this I think it's not

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.480 
able to sleep on this I think it's not
that<00:02:40.930> hard<00:02:41.200> it's<00:02:41.440> just<00:02:41.620> a<00:02:41.830> lot<00:02:42.130> of<00:02:42.220> hair<00:02:42.460> I

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
that hard it's just a lot of hair I

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.030 
that hard it's just a lot of hair I
guess<00:02:42.790> important<00:02:43.690> thing<00:02:44.110> is<00:02:44.350> that<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.800> don't

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
guess important thing is that you don't

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.220 
guess important thing is that you don't
have<00:02:45.250> your<00:02:45.430> hair<00:02:45.670> too<00:02:46.210> wet<00:02:46.450> because<00:02:46.780> if<00:02:47.080> it's

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
have your hair too wet because if it's

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.160 
have your hair too wet because if it's
really<00:02:47.680> soaking<00:02:48.070> what<00:02:48.600> it's<00:02:49.600> not<00:02:49.750> gonna<00:02:49.900> dry

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
really soaking what it's not gonna dry
