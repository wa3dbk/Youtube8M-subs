00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.570
 if we select the movie in the list of several 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.910
 we'll see

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.319
 something that we think 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.319
 it is very useful is the search 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:35.819
 searches by schedule 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.819
 by itself by classification and by gender 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.690
 By area you can select movies based on the time at which 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:44.579
 they start 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:47.699
