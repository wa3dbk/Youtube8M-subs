block table bring it home and I realize

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.520 
block table bring it home and I realize
that<00:00:07.609> the<00:00:07.970> legs<00:00:08.510> are<00:00:08.690> pretty<00:00:08.960> messed<00:00:09.200> up

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.530 
that the legs are pretty messed up

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.740 
that the legs are pretty messed up
they're<00:00:10.039> all<00:00:10.129> uneven<00:00:10.750> chewed<00:00:11.750> up<00:00:13.000> so<00:00:14.000> thinking

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
they're all uneven chewed up so thinking

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.050 
they're all uneven chewed up so thinking
on<00:00:15.139> how<00:00:15.379> I<00:00:15.410> could<00:00:15.830> not<00:00:16.190> only<00:00:16.460> give<00:00:16.730> it<00:00:16.850> a<00:00:16.910> few

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:17.060 
on how I could not only give it a few

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.499 
on how I could not only give it a few
inches<00:00:17.119> lifts<00:00:18.039> but<00:00:19.039> also<00:00:19.250> even<00:00:20.240> them<00:00:20.390> out

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
inches lifts but also even them out

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.769 
inches lifts but also even them out
because<00:00:21.080> there<00:00:21.439> some<00:00:22.099> are<00:00:22.250> shorter<00:00:22.640> than<00:00:22.849> the

because there some are shorter than the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.650

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
makes it even but it also gives me with

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.939 
makes it even but it also gives me with
three<00:00:56.539> or<00:00:56.690> four<00:00:56.870> inches<00:00:57.170> more<00:00:57.440> that<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.679> needed

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949 
three or four inches more that I needed

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:00.220

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
because I don't know why it was so short

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.810 
because I don't know why it was so short
maybe<00:01:02.809> because<00:01:03.620> it<00:01:03.739> was<00:01:03.769> so<00:01:04.040> old<00:01:04.280> it's<00:01:04.610> been
