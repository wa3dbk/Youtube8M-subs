it's like they they try to reach
perfection<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.989> they<00:02:13.140> never<00:02:13.349> get<00:02:13.590> there<00:02:13.920> and

00:02:14.089 --> 00:02:14.099 
perfection and they never get there and

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.750 
perfection and they never get there and
then<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:15.209> body<00:02:15.480> gets<00:02:15.840> old<00:02:16.319> and<00:02:16.739> tired<00:02:17.129> and

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.119 
the movement has so much experience to
tell<00:02:35.430> about<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.730> it's<00:02:36.120> this<00:02:36.810> movement<00:02:37.140> 1000

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
tell about that it's this movement 1000

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.180 
tell about that it's this movement 1000
times<00:02:38.370> so<00:02:38.750> 2,000<00:02:39.750> times<00:02:39.959> 3,000<00:02:40.680> times<00:02:40.829> so<00:02:41.069> it

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
times so 2,000 times 3,000 times so it

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.940 
times so 2,000 times 3,000 times so it
gets<00:02:41.430> richer<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.209> richer<00:02:42.709> although<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
gets richer and richer although the

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.819 
gets richer and richer although the
movement<00:02:44.160> in<00:02:44.610> size<00:02:45.090> maybe<00:02:45.629> gets<00:02:45.959> smaller<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
movement in size maybe gets smaller the

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.520 
movement in size maybe gets smaller the
arm<00:02:47.489> doesn't<00:02:47.760> stretch<00:02:48.209> so<00:02:48.480> much<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.959> the

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
arm doesn't stretch so much that the

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.890 
arm doesn't stretch so much that the
light<00:02:49.709> doesn't<00:02:49.950> stretch<00:02:50.400> so<00:02:50.670> much<00:02:50.879> but<00:02:51.150> the

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
light doesn't stretch so much but the

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.990 
light doesn't stretch so much but the
intensity<00:02:52.739> of<00:02:52.859> the<00:02:53.040> movement<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.670> growing

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
intensity of the movement it's growing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.160 
intensity of the movement it's growing
and<00:02:54.450> I<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.900> I<00:02:55.250> compare<00:02:56.250> that<00:02:56.579> with<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:57.170> message

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
and I see I compare that with a message

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.849 
and I see I compare that with a message
that<00:02:58.200> is<00:02:58.620> trying<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.129> arrive<00:02:59.370> home<00:02:59.700> and<00:03:00.859> he

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
that is trying to arrive home and he

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:05.720 
that is trying to arrive home and he
gets<00:03:02.069> tired<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.239> tired<00:03:04.069> every<00:03:05.069> time<00:03:05.310> he<00:03:05.430> tries

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:05.730 
gets tired and tired every time he tries

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.780 
gets tired and tired every time he tries
in<00:03:05.970> the<00:03:06.629> boat<00:03:07.109> goes<00:03:07.379> back<00:03:07.620> or<00:03:07.859> is<00:03:08.010> destroyed<00:03:08.459> we

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
in the boat goes back or is destroyed we

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.650 
in the boat goes back or is destroyed we
gets<00:03:09.120> lost<00:03:09.420> and<00:03:10.349> it's<00:03:10.560> in<00:03:10.799> some<00:03:11.069> Island<00:03:11.660> that

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
gets lost and it's in some Island that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.780 
gets lost and it's in some Island that
it<00:03:12.810> keeps<00:03:13.019> trying<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:14.160> more<00:03:14.370> he<00:03:14.400> tries

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
it keeps trying and the more he tries

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.140 
it keeps trying and the more he tries
the<00:03:15.090> more<00:03:15.120> he<00:03:15.510> gets<00:03:15.780> tired<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.500> because<00:03:17.150> of

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the more he gets tired and because of

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.990 
the more he gets tired and because of
that<00:03:18.389> the<00:03:18.660> wish<00:03:18.870> of<00:03:19.109> arriving<00:03:19.889> home<00:03:20.040> it's

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
that the wish of arriving home it's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.349 
that the wish of arriving home it's
stronger<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.260> when<00:03:23.130> he's<00:03:23.370> really<00:03:23.609> tired<00:03:23.970> and

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:24.359 
stronger and when he's really tired and

00:03:24.359 --> 00:03:26.979 
stronger and when he's really tired and
he<00:03:25.019> only<00:03:25.260> arrives<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.829> the<00:03:25.859> island<00:03:26.310> when<00:03:26.639> he's

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
he only arrives to the island when he's

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.900 
he only arrives to the island when he's
sleeping<00:03:27.989> it<00:03:28.079> doesn't<00:03:28.290> even<00:03:28.410> see<00:03:28.889> when<00:03:29.700> he

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
sleeping it doesn't even see when he

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.420 
sleeping it doesn't even see when he
arrives<00:03:30.239> so<00:03:30.569> it's<00:03:31.160> like<00:03:32.160> civic<00:03:33.030> I<00:03:33.919> think<00:03:34.919> that

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
arrives so it's like civic I think that

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.870 
arrives so it's like civic I think that
makes<00:03:35.730> me<00:03:35.910> think<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.450> lot<00:03:36.720> about<00:03:37.370> the<00:03:38.370> emotional

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
makes me think a lot about the emotional

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.479 
makes me think a lot about the emotional
side<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.569> Athens<00:03:41.150> yeah<00:03:42.650> it's<00:03:43.650> not<00:03:43.799> so<00:03:44.010> easy<00:03:44.040> to

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
side of Athens yeah it's not so easy to

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.270 
side of Athens yeah it's not so easy to
understand<00:03:45.030> how<00:03:45.299> I<00:03:45.329> built<00:03:45.750> the<00:03:45.989> base<00:03:46.280> because

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
understand how I built the base because

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.379 
understand how I built the base because
it's<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.970> big<00:03:48.209> confusing<00:03:49.700> but<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:50.760> think<00:03:51.150> it's

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:51.389 
it's a big confusing but I think it's

00:03:51.389 --> 00:03:55.069 
it's a big confusing but I think it's
easy<00:03:51.720> to<00:03:52.190> receive<00:03:53.190> it<00:03:53.370> this<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.389> what<00:03:54.599> I<00:03:54.780> want

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
easy to receive it this is what I want

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:58.640 
easy to receive it this is what I want
because<00:03:55.560> I<00:03:55.590> put<00:03:56.280> more<00:03:56.840> importance<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:58.379> the

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
because I put more importance in the

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.089 
because I put more importance in the
emotional<00:03:59.220> side<00:03:59.519> of<00:03:59.819> the<00:04:00.660> story<00:04:01.500> than<00:04:01.829> the

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:02.099 
emotional side of the story than the

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.610 
emotional side of the story than the
story<00:04:02.280> itself<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:04.049> narrative<00:04:04.620> so<00:04:04.919> I<00:04:04.950> think

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:06.620 
story itself the narrative so I think

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.990 
story itself the narrative so I think
maybe<00:04:07.620> it's<00:04:07.949> not<00:04:08.069> easy<00:04:08.370> to<00:04:08.579> see<00:04:08.790> how<00:04:08.940> I

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
maybe it's not easy to see how I

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.599 
maybe it's not easy to see how I
constructed<00:04:09.840> but<00:04:10.079> it's<00:04:10.349> easy<00:04:10.769> to<00:04:11.099> receive<00:04:11.459> the

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:11.609 
constructed but it's easy to receive the

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:16.280 
constructed but it's easy to receive the
businesses<00:04:12.269> home<00:04:12.650> important<00:04:13.650> for<00:04:13.859> me<00:04:14.040> so
