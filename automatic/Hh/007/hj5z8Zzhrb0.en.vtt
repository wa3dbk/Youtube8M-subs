00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
 these are the three colorful toys 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.319
 that allowed me to experiment 

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.660
 and to really try the new one in depth 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.160
 vocal assistant of microsoft with tern 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.620
 I really liked it and I wanted to 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.330
 try it studies devices this is 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.570
 this does not even reach 100 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:19.439
 EUR 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.070
 and at the end on the lumia 640 to see 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.070
 how does it work 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:35.190
 as I told you short but it's a software 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.470
 really very interesting present on 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 last and not last lumia 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.050
 obviously the devices must be 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:46.350
 updated to version 8.1 as a minimum 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:49.650
 in order to use this assistant 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.540
 vocal is really well done in the beginning 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.550
 there is a particular configuration in 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.010
 which will ask for your name and all 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.510
 main information and above all 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.970
 your interests to be able to then 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.309
 suggest these news as you can 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.810
 see here we go immediately to put to 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.160
 try the three microsoft lumia devices 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:14.190
 435 microsoft lumia 640 obviously 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.180
 version lte and here in the end we have 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.670
 still a nokia lumia 530 colors 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 orange for the two little ones instead for 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.729
 the greatest this beautiful 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:30.080
 bluish coloration 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:34.850
 let's put them to the test let's start 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.850
 what the weather will be like tomorrow in paris 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.479
 as you can see the devices a 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:56.759
 depending on their performance they arrive 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.860
 before or after the first as is obvious and the 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:06.119
 lumia 640 followed by 435 and last 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.590
 we actually have the 530 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.660
 software is very valid and you can 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.460
 really ask him anything 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.210
 I asked him 

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:17.550
 to schedule alarm clocks to send 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:19.560
 messages to call someone then vi 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.150
 will understand in most cases 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.800
 obviously there are some here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.690
 settings we can go to 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.520
 see me 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.650
 in the settings I did not make the 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.340
 particular settings I left in the 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:35.940
 most cases as I have 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.480
 just set my facebook name 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:41.490
 not connected but you can very well 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.990
 go and connect it and then we say 

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:48.660
 you can also choose the mode a little 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:51.030
 research and many other things anyway 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.280
 a really interesting software e 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.980
 maybe he is one of those who has a voice 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.560
 less robotic the robotic voice is a 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.420
 which I absolutely can't stand 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.670
 I seem to be talking to a toy 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.100
 instead I really like it when there 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:13.190
 voice is very close to reality 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:13.190
 let's do a last test as my name is 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.980
 here it is and this is the last proof that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.470
 I wanted to do 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.470
 in short, a really well done software 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.510
 I like that it's implemented on 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.730
 devices of the media on long range 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.110
 but it is above all on the top range for the 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.690
 moment is all friends if you need 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.550
 of anything just ask 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.270
 write me and I in the shortest time 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:38.160
 possible 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:42.230
 I will try to reply to you all 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.230
