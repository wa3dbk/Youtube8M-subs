00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.740
 good and now we want to continue 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.050
 recommending them what form there is how 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.459
 can you 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.620
 congratulate bid congratulate bid and 

00:00:08.459 --> 00:00:12.839
 Of course the word photography comes to me 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.089
 he did not pull it forward yes how can they 

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:16.740
 you congratulate this Christmas of a 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.660
 original shape with pictures of babies 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.700
 and children but not with what we do with 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.100
 the mobile we are going to make a collage artist 

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.480
 with the levels because there are also 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.710
 some offers that have called us the 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.240
 Attention to special discounts 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.480
 that can make these sessions 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.759
 photographic with babies besides quality 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 those sessions can be up to 50 a 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.840
 40 percent cheaper we are seeing 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.690
 some children pose estefanÃ­a when they are 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.480
 so little commons keep looking 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.910
 to the camera like this is almost impossible 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.400
 they do everything from competitions of 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.780
 good soap is that lourdes has 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.220
 a lot of imagination to make the 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.750
 children look at them later when they are more 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.400
 as many frames as we have 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.530
 there behind and he's six years old 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.629
 much easier over is with his mom 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.190
 which already makes things much easier 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.480
 better we have a lourdes balduque 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.739
 lourdes there you still give the camera 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.840
 let's introduce our other 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.840
 protagonists who are marta hello marta 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.580
 but look what is left of cold and you 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 frame boats good morning good morning and 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.649
 they are landmarks that you have and they are doing you 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 a photo book with your mom then you 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.200
 like to see the photos now of 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.300
 suddenly our other couple who has already 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.250
 finished so the little girl the smallest 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:31.500
 battery 17 months and there you have to 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 play lourdes more then with quotes that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.550
 call the attention the months that valeria 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.679
 for that camera eats and does 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.210
 we're going to talk a lot 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.220
 with you 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.720
 you said this is a very original idea for 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.490
 example to give now at Christmas 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.440
 can join up the family in 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.510
 complete the entire family and 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.730
 we make a good photo 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.860
 with hairdressing makeup all together 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:54.480
 because people have lots of pictures and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.370
 has digital cameras all over the world 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.800
 digital but it's not the same as a 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:02.210
 professional you prepare and have some 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.210
 photos as well as those of Isabel Preysler 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.110
 of course if it says out there marta I do not know what 

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.970
 well he has bought sessions and it's 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:16.590
 true that goes out like every year 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.120
 then while they are still posing 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:19.740
 useful you still do photos is more 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.040
 easy with a child more clear senior not 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.480
 this time it's a little easier with the 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.370
 older child and especially if it is a 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.950
 framework is very obedient to that on the 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.170
 I try to play a lot with them so that 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 feel at home and make it all 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.740
 easier because in the end it's a boy and 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.490
 He wants to play to see what you say 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.430
 to them 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.230
 miley saw to see frames come on let's go to 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.400
 bet this frame this is very easy 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.620
 with the 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.430
 you know come to hug is a little bit 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:52.189
 hug mom give her a little kiss to see what 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.189
 so you were fine as his mother 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.790
 it is not the same as if we take with another 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:00.590
 mobile and we take a picture if there is a 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.450
 family for example four members 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.810
 parents and two children how much can 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.610
 leave then about two hundred euros more or 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.950
 less not month in prices but good 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.450
 on the web you can see it perfectly and 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.550
 You can buy them during the month of 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.140
 December to 50% of the prices that 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.630
 We will have the rest of the year to 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.519
 give away can not consume until April 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.170
 this kind of session so we would add 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.420
 50 percent after exactly 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.680
 and if they are four friends for the better because 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.900
 they share it and it comes out very cheap 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.940
 man look if it is between four what 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:32.540
 divide days and there would be no fixed areas 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:34.069
 we give ideas we give ideas good we are 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:36.019
 already with Carlos and we take away the 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:37.970
 fan that is already double 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:39.769
 the malik program was super good hair 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:42.920
 and to be handsome to suffer, you have to 

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:46.599
 be very clear you give them some advice 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:48.920
 when they get good then the hair 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.930
 of course we have a make-up hairdresser 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:52.790
 We give them a tip having 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.230
 together the mom and the child are admired 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.599
 for example they wear white clothes and 

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:58.670
 black and good if they want to come in red and 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:00.500
 black in blue but both 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.360
 with the same range of colors so that 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.040
 then in the picture it looks really nice and 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.080
 very simple things that do not bring that not 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.050
 bring marks because then it tires a lot 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.480
 see a mark on a shirt and during 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:13.099
 years that you are going to have the photo at home like this 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.650
 that then we make them a makeup like 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.840
 kind of girlfriend to girlfriend type moms 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:20.389
 they look very natural and the children 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.859
 we also give some colors of yes to the 

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:25.100
 little girls of the children 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.200
 love the green saying everything is left 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:29.780
 I go with the couple in question what 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.880
 you are going to leave mom and boy 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:33.590
 we already know idea as a Christmas gift or 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:36.050
 idea as bachelorette party is idea 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:37.340
 of all kinds you have to take advantage of this 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.020
 offer that only the month of December was 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.000
 You can use it later until 30 

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.700
 April so then we have time to 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.800
 use that 50% discount voucher is 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.139
 very well and the advice that has 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.660
 said lourdes then also the result 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.830
 is that you have left for all life I think 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.930
 that those things that you wear on your feet 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:56.880
 Stephanie is to pose and not to stain 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:59.220
 clear that between the wind of the fan 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.630
 that is also left and the photoshop that I 

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:02.130
 I think these sessions always lead 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.200
 a little bit of citation and tell us 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.670
 well, that little touch of photoshop to 

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.140
 final success I think it's 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:09.230
 guaranteed is a very good idea who 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.230
 do not
