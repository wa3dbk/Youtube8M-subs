you by exam feel calm no more fear from
exam<00:00:10.519> family<00:00:11.519> planning<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:12.120> very<00:00:12.900> important

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
exam family planning a very important

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.250 
exam family planning a very important
topic<00:00:13.530> and<00:00:14.040> why<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.610> necessary<00:00:14.820> as<00:00:15.330> I<00:00:16.020> said

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
topic and why is it necessary as I said

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.670 
topic and why is it necessary as I said
we<00:00:16.529> all<00:00:16.560> know<00:00:17.039> that<00:00:18.560> population<00:00:19.560> is

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
we all know that population is

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.230 
we all know that population is
increasing<00:00:20.689> exponentially<00:00:21.689> D<00:00:22.140> by<00:00:22.350> D<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> it<00:00:24.090> is

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
increasing exponentially D by D so it is

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.330 
increasing exponentially D by D so it is
really<00:00:24.510> really<00:00:24.750> necessary<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.710> limit<00:00:26.070> this

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
really really necessary to limit this

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.870 
really really necessary to limit this
huge<00:00:26.699> increase<00:00:27.000> in<00:00:27.449> population<00:00:28.550> so<00:00:29.550> what<00:00:29.760> do

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
huge increase in population so what do

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.030 
huge increase in population so what do
you<00:00:29.970> think<00:00:30.269> will<00:00:30.449> happen<00:00:30.480> if<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.500> population

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
you think will happen if the population

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.280 
you think will happen if the population
is<00:00:32.130> not<00:00:32.279> restricted<00:00:32.910> they<00:00:33.719> will<00:00:33.930> display<00:00:34.230> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
is not restricted they will display a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.889 
is not restricted they will display a
city<00:00:34.649> of<00:00:34.739> every<00:00:35.250> little<00:00:35.880> suppose<00:00:36.180> when<00:00:36.420> the

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
city of every little suppose when the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.729 
city of every little suppose when the
number<00:00:37.170> of<00:00:37.290> people<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.070> for<00:00:39.260> you<00:00:40.260> your

are increasing gradually what is
happening<00:01:03.379> gradually<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.890> resources<00:01:05.489> are

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
happening gradually the resources are

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.670 
happening gradually the resources are
remaining<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.240> same<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:06.810> amount<00:01:07.200> of<00:01:07.409> food

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
remaining the same the amount of food

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.539 
remaining the same the amount of food
the<00:01:08.400> amount<00:01:08.850> of<00:01:09.150> houses<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.409> amount<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.189> money

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the amount of houses the amount of money

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.609 
the amount of houses the amount of money
everything<00:01:12.090> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> same<00:01:12.360> by<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.140> number<00:01:13.590> of

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
everything is the same by the number of

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.100 
everything is the same by the number of
people<00:01:13.979> for<00:01:14.520> utilizing<00:01:15.030> all<00:01:15.420> these<00:01:15.630> things<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
people for utilizing all these things is

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.620 
people for utilizing all these things is
increasing<00:01:16.619> too<00:01:16.799> much<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.909> now<00:01:18.000> people<00:01:18.240> will

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
increasing too much so now people will

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.899 
increasing too much so now people will
be<00:01:18.780> deprived<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.500> food<00:01:19.770> people<00:01:20.640> will<00:01:20.790> be

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
be deprived of food people will be

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.090 
be deprived of food people will be
deprived<00:01:21.270> of<00:01:21.479> Education<00:01:21.659> people<00:01:22.590> will<00:01:22.979> be

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
deprived of Education people will be

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.660 
deprived of Education people will be
deprived<00:01:23.490> of<00:01:24.650> jobs<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.280> there<00:01:26.460> will<00:01:26.610> be

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
deprived of jobs so there will be

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.030 
deprived of jobs so there will be
unemployable<00:01:27.299> together<00:01:27.780> the<00:01:28.049> poverty<00:01:28.560> so

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
unemployable together the poverty so

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.920 
unemployable together the poverty so
people<00:01:29.369> will<00:01:29.520> die<00:01:29.670> of<00:01:29.700> hunger<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.630> all<00:01:30.689> these

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
people will die of hunger so all these

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.120 
people will die of hunger so all these
things<00:01:31.140> will<00:01:31.409> happen

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
things will happen

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.069 
things will happen
right<00:01:32.579> so<00:01:33.060> therefore<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.540> is<00:01:33.570> very<00:01:33.689> very

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
right so therefore it is very very

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.499 
right so therefore it is very very
necessary<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.799> we<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.460> limit<00:01:35.850> to<00:01:36.329> this

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:36.509 
necessary that we put a limit to this

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
necessary that we put a limit to this
form<00:01:36.869> C<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.829> from<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.540> overpopulation<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:40.259> if

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
form C is from the overpopulation if if

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.039 
form C is from the overpopulation if if
it<00:01:41.250> keeps<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> increasing<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.299> way<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:42.930> a

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
it keeps on increasing this way then a

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.270 
it keeps on increasing this way then a
day<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.470> come<00:01:43.649> when<00:01:43.710> there<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.250> be

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
day will come when there will be

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.950 
day will come when there will be
scarcity<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.939> food<00:01:45.060> there<00:01:45.540> will<00:01:45.720> be<00:01:45.750> low

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
scarcity of food there will be low

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.810 
scarcity of food there will be low
employment<00:01:46.619> there<00:01:46.799> were<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.009> low<00:01:47.159> education

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
employment there were the low education

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.999 
employment there were the low education
went<00:01:48.390> because<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.780> resources<00:01:49.200> are<00:01:49.350> limited

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
went because the resources are limited

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.770 
went because the resources are limited
but<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.610> people<00:01:50.970> who<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.180> using<00:01:51.600> these

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
but the people who are using these

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.880 
but the people who are using these
resources<00:01:51.840> are<00:01:52.649> increased<00:01:53.100> day<00:01:53.490> by<00:01:53.520> day<00:01:54.890> so

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
resources are increased day by day so

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.649 
resources are increased day by day so
let<00:01:56.369> us<00:01:56.399> take<00:01:56.579> a<00:01:56.670> small<00:01:56.790> example<00:01:56.969> it'll

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
let us take a small example it'll

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.929 
let us take a small example it'll
suppose<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.049> there<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.590> family<00:01:58.799> where<00:01:59.549> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
suppose if there is a family where the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.370 
suppose if there is a family where the
husband<00:02:00.360> earns<00:02:00.979> somebody<00:02:01.979> okay<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.600> he<00:02:03.869> has<00:02:03.899> if

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
husband earns somebody okay so he has if

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.180 
husband earns somebody okay so he has if
he<00:02:04.500> has<00:02:04.680> just<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.250> child<00:02:05.759> he<00:02:06.659> can<00:02:06.960> use<00:02:07.740> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
he has just one child he can use that

children off so now they will not get

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.880

that good education they will not get
that<00:02:29.269> okay<00:02:30.269> so<00:02:30.720> when<00:02:30.870> the<00:02:30.989> quantity<00:02:31.560> increases

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
that okay so when the quantity increases

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.500 
that okay so when the quantity increases
the<00:02:32.610> quality<00:02:33.349> decreases<00:02:34.349> so<00:02:34.980> the<00:02:35.069> quality

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
the quality decreases so the quality

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.880 
the quality decreases so the quality
becomes<00:02:36.510> bad<00:02:36.810> when<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.319> number<00:02:37.620> of<00:02:37.650> people

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
becomes bad when the number of people

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.190 
becomes bad when the number of people
are<00:02:38.190> more<00:02:38.400> so<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.209> is<00:02:39.330> very<00:02:39.510> important<00:02:40.110> that

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
are more so it is very important that

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.350 
are more so it is very important that
people<00:02:40.319> should<00:02:41.069> go<00:02:41.400> for<00:02:41.670> finally<00:02:42.120> blind

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
people should go for finally blind

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
that is very very important but has to

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:47.730 
that is very very important but has to
take<00:04:45.729> into<00:04:46.000> consideration<00:04:46.030> the<00:04:46.990> family's

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
take into consideration the family's

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.310 
take into consideration the family's
income<00:04:48.039> now<00:04:48.940> in<00:04:49.120> many<00:04:49.300> families<00:04:49.840> it<00:04:49.990> is<00:04:50.080> seen

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:50.320 
income now in many families it is seen

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:53.219 
income now in many families it is seen
that<00:04:50.530> the<00:04:50.590> husband<00:04:51.400> is<00:04:51.520> working<00:04:51.810> he's<00:04:52.810> earning

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:53.229 
that the husband is working he's earning

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.279 
that the husband is working he's earning
the<00:04:53.530> wife<00:04:53.710> is<00:04:53.979> also<00:04:54.160> onion<00:04:54.610> so<00:04:55.300> the<00:04:55.509> income<00:04:56.110> is

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:56.289 
the wife is also onion so the income is

00:04:56.289 --> 00:04:56.730 
the wife is also onion so the income is
good

00:04:56.730 --> 00:04:56.740 
good

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:58.710 
good
so<00:04:57.160> in<00:04:57.250> that<00:04:57.400> case<00:04:57.639> if<00:04:57.850> they<00:04:58.000> think<00:04:58.060> that<00:04:58.510> they

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
so in that case if they think that they

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.150 
so in that case if they think that they
are<00:04:58.750> earning<00:04:59.020> really<00:04:59.470> well<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.889> they<00:05:00.130> really

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:00.160 
are earning really well and they really

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:01.770 
are earning really well and they really
want<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.699> have<00:05:00.850> two<00:05:01.210> kids

want to have two kids
fair<00:05:02.440> enough<00:05:02.620> but<00:05:02.919> on<00:05:03.460> the<00:05:03.580> other<00:05:03.669> hand<00:05:03.789> if

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
fair enough but on the other hand if

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.700 
fair enough but on the other hand if
there<00:05:04.270> is<00:05:04.389> another<00:05:04.570> family<00:05:04.900> where<00:05:05.289> only<00:05:05.470> the

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
there is another family where only the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:08.310 
there is another family where only the
husband<00:05:06.039> is<00:05:06.190> working<00:05:06.340> at<00:05:06.760> that<00:05:06.789> -<00:05:07.139> he's<00:05:08.139> not

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:08.320 
husband is working at that - he's not

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:10.560 
husband is working at that - he's not
earning<00:05:08.620> much<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.820> even<00:05:10.180> though<00:05:10.360> they

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
earning much that is even though they

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:11.909 
earning much that is even though they
feel<00:05:10.840> that<00:05:10.990> they<00:05:11.169> should<00:05:11.320> have<00:05:11.440> five<00:05:11.680> kids

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
feel that they should have five kids

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.340 
feel that they should have five kids
they<00:05:12.430> should<00:05:12.610> actually<00:05:12.820> have<00:05:13.210> one<00:05:13.510> so<00:05:14.139> that

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
they should actually have one so that

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.920 
they should actually have one so that
they<00:05:14.560> can<00:05:14.740> at<00:05:14.860> least<00:05:15.070> afford<00:05:15.370> to<00:05:16.210> have<00:05:16.389> give<00:05:16.720> a

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
they can at least afford to have give a

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.140 
they can at least afford to have give a
good<00:05:17.169> quality<00:05:17.680> of<00:05:17.800> life<00:05:17.919> to<00:05:18.400> that<00:05:18.580> one<00:05:18.820> child

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
good quality of life to that one child

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:21.300 
good quality of life to that one child
right<00:05:19.750> so<00:05:20.199> the<00:05:20.320> number<00:05:20.680> of<00:05:20.800> children<00:05:21.010> in<00:05:21.280> the

five<00:05:50.470> six<00:05:50.830> daughters<00:05:51.099> just<00:05:51.880> to<00:05:52.300> just<00:05:52.930> with<00:05:53.139> the

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:53.260 
five six daughters just to just with the

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:55.830 
five six daughters just to just with the
hope<00:05:53.500> that<00:05:53.650> someday<00:05:54.370> a<00:05:54.550> son<00:05:54.909> will<00:05:55.120> be<00:05:55.240> born<00:05:55.270> and

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
hope that someday a son will be born and

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.219 
hope that someday a son will be born and
that<00:05:56.770> is<00:05:56.949> not<00:05:57.490> at<00:05:57.699> all<00:05:57.789> right<00:05:58.090> because<00:05:58.570> just<00:05:59.080> to

00:05:59.219 --> 00:05:59.229 
that is not at all right because just to

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:02.610 
that is not at all right because just to
get<00:05:59.440> a<00:05:59.729> male<00:06:00.729> child<00:06:01.090> they<00:06:01.599> gave<00:06:01.870> birth<00:06:02.139> to<00:06:02.199> so

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:02.620 
get a male child they gave birth to so

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:04.610 
get a male child they gave birth to so
many<00:06:02.860> females<00:06:03.340> children<00:06:04.000> are<00:06:04.210> necessary

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
many females children are necessary

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.839 
many females children are necessary
right<00:06:05.620> so<00:06:06.220> there<00:06:06.430> should<00:06:06.669> be<00:06:06.699> no

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:06.849 
right so there should be no

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.210 
right so there should be no
differentiation<00:06:07.510> between<00:06:07.900> engage<00:06:08.680> life<00:06:08.949> and

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:09.220 
differentiation between engage life and

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:11.580 
differentiation between engage life and
a<00:06:09.310> phenotype<00:06:09.820> because<00:06:10.330> anyways<00:06:10.840> these<00:06:11.080> days<00:06:11.380> a

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:11.590 
a phenotype because anyways these days a

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.710 
a phenotype because anyways these days a
girl<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.159> a<00:06:12.490> boy<00:06:12.699> both<00:06:13.030> are<00:06:13.210> treated<00:06:13.599> as

everything

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:30.760 
everything

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.450 
everything
happen<00:06:31.510> with<00:06:31.990> the<00:06:32.110> coordination<00:06:32.830> of<00:06:32.920> both<00:06:33.220> the

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:35.380 
males and the females right so there

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:36.750 
males and the females right so there
should<00:06:35.590> be<00:06:35.620> no<00:06:35.740> differentiation<00:06:36.340> between

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
should be no differentiation between

should be no differentiation between
male<00:06:37.480> and<00:06:37.510> female<00:06:37.780> time<00:06:38.380> so<00:06:38.770> if<00:06:38.950> this

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.280 
male and female time so if this

00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.460 
male and female time so if this
differentiation<00:06:39.940> doesn't<00:06:40.450> exist<00:06:40.930> then<00:06:41.350> at

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:41.470 
differentiation doesn't exist then at

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:45.000 
differentiation doesn't exist then at
least<00:06:41.910> both<00:06:42.910> girl-child<00:06:43.600> who<00:06:44.380> takes<00:06:44.680> birth

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
least both girl-child who takes birth

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.460 
least both girl-child who takes birth
only<00:06:45.520> with<00:06:45.640> the<00:06:45.760> hope<00:06:46.000> of<00:06:46.240> a<00:06:46.420> more<00:06:46.660> join<00:06:46.960> with

00:06:47.460 --> 00:06:47.470 
only with the hope of a more join with

00:06:47.470 --> 00:06:51.030 
only with the hope of a more join with
at<00:06:47.590> least<00:06:47.830> reduce<00:06:48.540> right<00:06:49.540> so<00:06:49.990> these<00:06:50.140> are<00:06:50.440> some

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.040 
at least reduce right so these are some

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.580 
at least reduce right so these are some
of<00:06:51.070> the<00:06:51.550> thought<00:06:52.210> processes<00:06:52.690> which<00:06:53.230> should<00:06:53.440> be

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
of the thought processes which should be

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.400 
of the thought processes which should be
changed<00:06:54.070> in<00:06:54.430> order<00:06:54.940> to<00:06:55.120> put<00:06:55.690> family<00:06:56.170> planning

00:06:56.400 --> 00:06:56.410 
changed in order to put family planning

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:00.810 
changed in order to put family planning
in<00:06:56.800> properties<00:06:58.170> that<00:06:59.170> should<00:06:59.710> plan<00:06:59.980> a<00:07:00.220> baby<00:07:00.460> at

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820 
in properties that should plan a baby at

00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:02.790 
in properties that should plan a baby at
their<00:07:01.240> right<00:07:01.540> age<00:07:01.870> that<00:07:02.290> is<00:07:02.470> also<00:07:02.650> very

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:02.800 
their right age that is also very

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.220 
their right age that is also very
important<00:07:03.460> now<00:07:03.940> as<00:07:04.150> I<00:07:04.180> said<00:07:04.360> before<00:07:04.570> also<00:07:05.080> that

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:05.230 
important now as I said before also that

00:07:05.230 --> 00:07:07.980 
important now as I said before also that
if<00:07:05.500> the<00:07:05.650> parents<00:07:05.800> are<00:07:06.250> 45<00:07:06.820> or<00:07:07.150> 50<00:07:07.540> years<00:07:07.690> old

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
if the parents are 45 or 50 years old

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.230 
if the parents are 45 or 50 years old
and<00:07:08.320> if<00:07:08.710> at<00:07:09.040> that<00:07:09.070> time<00:07:09.490> they<00:07:09.700> plant<00:07:10.000> they<00:07:10.210> are

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:10.240 
and if at that time they plant they are

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:13.110 
and if at that time they plant they are
planning<00:07:10.540> for<00:07:10.690> a<00:07:10.840> baby<00:07:10.900> so<00:07:11.800> that<00:07:12.160> is<00:07:12.280> not<00:07:12.820> right

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:13.120 
planning for a baby so that is not right

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.090 
planning for a baby so that is not right
because<00:07:13.450> by<00:07:13.750> the<00:07:13.870> time<00:07:14.170> the<00:07:14.380> baby<00:07:14.590> is<00:07:14.830> just

because by the time the baby is just

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.010 
because by the time the baby is just
five<00:07:15.340> years<00:07:15.370> old<00:07:15.790> the<00:07:16.030> parents<00:07:16.450> are<00:07:16.600> more<00:07:16.840> than
