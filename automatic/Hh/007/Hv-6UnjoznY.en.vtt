00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.670 
confessional and they're really thick
around<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.340> middle<00:01:54.550> and<00:01:55.080> they're<00:01:56.080> thicker

I'm<00:02:52.450> stretching<00:02:52.780> my<00:02:52.989> ears<00:02:53.100> but<00:02:54.100> as<00:02:54.310> you<00:02:54.430> can

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
I'm stretching my ears but as you can

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:57.810 
I'm stretching my ears but as you can
tell<00:02:54.580> this<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.480> not<00:02:55.870> as<00:02:56.140> easily<00:02:56.769> flexible<00:02:57.640> as

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
tell this is not as easily flexible as

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.619 
tell this is not as easily flexible as
all<00:02:57.970> the<00:02:58.090> other<00:02:58.209> chaos<00:02:58.630> software

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:00.629 
all the other chaos software

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.080 
all the other chaos software
it's<00:03:01.629> got<00:03:02.050> sharper<00:03:02.830> edges<00:03:03.099> on<00:03:03.430> the<00:03:03.580> middle<00:03:03.910> I

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it's got sharper edges on the middle I

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.839 
it's got sharper edges on the middle I
guess<00:03:04.510> I<00:03:04.540> keep<00:03:04.959> it<00:03:05.080> in<00:03:05.170> here<00:03:05.519> also<00:03:06.519> it's

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
guess I keep it in here also it's

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.910 
guess I keep it in here also it's
thicker<00:03:07.180> around<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.840> middle<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.319> it's<00:03:08.739> got

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
thicker around the middle and it's got

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.830 
thicker around the middle and it's got
an<00:03:09.010> extra<00:03:09.400> rubber<00:03:09.670> on<00:03:09.940> to<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.269> and<00:03:10.420> this<00:03:10.660> is<00:03:10.810> a

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
an extra rubber on to it and this is a

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.940 
an extra rubber on to it and this is a
flesh<00:03:11.200> tunnel<00:03:11.650> addition<00:03:12.190> to<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:14.530> a<00:03:14.590> flesh

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
flesh tunnel addition to this is a flesh

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.809 
flesh tunnel addition to this is a flesh
tunnel<00:03:15.370> additional<00:03:15.970> one<00:03:16.090> I<00:03:17.489> just<00:03:18.489> think<00:03:18.730> that

00:03:18.809 --> 00:03:18.819 
tunnel additional one I just think that

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.740 
tunnel additional one I just think that
there's<00:03:19.150> like<00:03:19.390> different<00:03:19.599> additions<00:03:20.440> like

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
there's like different additions like

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.170 
there's like different additions like
they<00:03:22.750> made<00:03:22.959> new<00:03:23.140> one<00:03:23.379> as<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:24.459> got<00:03:24.610> hired<00:03:24.879> and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
so anyway this is an eyelet this is what

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.080 
so anyway this is an eyelet this is what
you're<00:03:49.480> supposed<00:03:49.629> to<00:03:49.959> use<00:03:50.340> just<00:03:51.340> a<00:03:51.610> day<00:03:51.760> carry

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
you're supposed to use just a day carry

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.270 
you're supposed to use just a day carry
off<00:03:52.209> altogether<00:03:52.540> and<00:03:53.049> the<00:03:53.349> hard<00:03:53.530> ones<00:03:53.739> because

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:54.280 
off altogether and the hard ones because

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.360 
off altogether and the hard ones because
I<00:03:54.400> found<00:03:54.580> maybe<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.940> best<00:03:55.120> you<00:03:55.299> use<00:03:55.540> long<00:03:55.900> tail

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370 
I found maybe the best you use long tail

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.640 
I found maybe the best you use long tail
these<00:03:57.370> are<00:03:57.610> less<00:03:58.150> music<00:03:58.780> actually<00:03:59.230> cheaper

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
these are less music actually cheaper

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.250 
these are less music actually cheaper
than<00:03:59.799> these<00:04:00.010> I<00:04:00.360> got<00:04:01.360> these<00:04:01.510> for<00:04:01.569> 18<00:04:02.080> minutes

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:02.260 
than these I got these for 18 minutes

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.369 
than these I got these for 18 minutes
for<00:04:02.590> 22<00:04:02.980> so<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.450> ILA<00:04:04.810> to<00:04:04.989> just<00:04:05.200> all-around

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:05.379 
for 22 so the ILA to just all-around

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.320 
for 22 so the ILA to just all-around
cheaper<00:04:06.069> and<00:04:06.340> they're<00:04:06.940> more<00:04:07.120> comfortable

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:07.330 
cheaper and they're more comfortable

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:09.180 
cheaper and they're more comfortable
it's<00:04:07.989> the<00:04:08.049> only<00:04:08.080> problem<00:04:08.620> I<00:04:08.739> have<00:04:08.890> with<00:04:08.920> these

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
it's the only problem I have with these

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.509 
it's the only problem I have with these
is<00:04:09.519> that<00:04:09.629> they<00:04:10.629> fall<00:04:10.660> out<00:04:10.870> when<00:04:11.140> you<00:04:11.230> sleep<00:04:11.519> so

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:12.519 
is that they fall out when you sleep so

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:14.850 
is that they fall out when you sleep so
be<00:04:13.000> careful<00:04:13.390> about<00:04:13.480> that<00:04:13.569> so<00:04:14.200> I<00:04:14.230> usually<00:04:14.650> put<00:04:14.799> a

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:14.860 
be careful about that so I usually put a

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:17.159 
be careful about that so I usually put a
bandaid<00:04:15.190> around<00:04:15.459> my<00:04:15.549> ears<00:04:15.730> but<00:04:16.720> as<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.079> can

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
bandaid around my ears but as you can

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.949 
bandaid around my ears but as you can
tell<00:04:17.229> and<00:04:17.590> eyelet<00:04:18.100> is<00:04:18.340> much<00:04:19.209> easier<00:04:19.239> to<00:04:19.720> fold

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
tell and eyelet is much easier to fold

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.740 
tell and eyelet is much easier to fold
it's<00:04:20.380> not<00:04:20.769> as<00:04:21.100> sharp<00:04:21.639> around<00:04:22.060> the<00:04:22.210> edge<00:04:22.330> it's

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
it's not as sharp around the edge it's

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.330 
it's not as sharp around the edge it's
not<00:04:22.930> a<00:04:22.960> stick<00:04:23.289> around<00:04:23.500> the<00:04:23.710> middle<00:04:23.949> and<00:04:24.130> it's

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
not a stick around the middle and it's

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.920 
not a stick around the middle and it's
got<00:04:24.430> a<00:04:24.460> bigger<00:04:24.669> hole<00:04:24.880> in<00:04:25.030> it<00:04:25.150> so<00:04:25.510> they<00:04:25.750> look

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
got a bigger hole in it so they look

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:28.439 
got a bigger hole in it so they look
bigger<00:04:26.139> in<00:04:26.260> your<00:04:26.440> ears<00:04:26.729> then<00:04:27.729> the<00:04:27.910> actual<00:04:28.120> size

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
bigger in your ears then the actual size

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:32.939 
bigger in your ears then the actual size
it's<00:04:29.020> really<00:04:29.260> cool<00:04:29.410> um<00:04:31.620> but<00:04:32.620> that's<00:04:32.800> pretty

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:32.949 
it's really cool um but that's pretty

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:34.800 
it's really cool um but that's pretty
