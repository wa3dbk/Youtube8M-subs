this<00:04:09.419> one<00:04:09.479> out<00:04:09.629> then<00:04:10.260> last<00:04:10.500> machine<00:04:10.680> on<00:04:10.979> our

laptop but I think it has many of the
qualities<00:04:15.900> that<00:04:16.139> most<00:04:16.799> people<00:04:17.070> are<00:04:17.159> going<00:04:17.280> to

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
qualities that most people are going to

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.240 
qualities that most people are going to
use<00:04:17.609> on<00:04:17.789> a<00:04:17.820> laptop<00:04:18.329> in<00:04:18.720> today's<00:04:19.590> a<00:04:19.620> modern

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
standpoint and that definitely has to be

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.250 
standpoint and that definitely has to be

00:04:48.649 --> 00:04:48.659 
and one of the main reasons why I like

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.899 
and one of the main reasons why I like
the<00:04:48.960> surface<00:04:49.169> computer<00:04:49.710> so<00:04:50.039> much<00:04:50.280> and<00:04:50.550> why<00:04:50.879> I

00:04:50.899 --> 00:04:50.909 
the surface computer so much and why I

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:52.550 
the surface computer so much and why I
think<00:04:51.210> it<00:04:51.389> could<00:04:51.629> be<00:04:51.780> a<00:04:51.810> great<00:04:52.199> laptop

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:52.560

replacement<00:04:53.069> is<00:04:53.460> the<00:04:53.610> fact<00:04:53.819> that<00:04:53.940> Microsoft

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
replacement is the fact that Microsoft

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.559 
replacement is the fact that Microsoft
really<00:04:55.050> controls<00:04:55.650> the<00:04:56.220> whole<00:04:56.550> solution<00:04:57.090> so

00:04:57.559 --> 00:04:57.569 
really controls the whole solution so

00:04:57.569 --> 00:04:59.779 
really controls the whole solution so
from<00:04:57.810> the<00:04:57.960> software<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.949> the<00:04:59.129> hardware<00:04:59.580> you're

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
from the software to the hardware you're

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.089 
from the software to the hardware you're
having<00:05:00.150> a<00:05:00.240> very<00:05:00.449> cohesive<00:05:00.870> experience<00:05:01.169> that's

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:02.099 
having a very cohesive experience that's

has to offer compared to what all the

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:31.279 
has to offer compared to what all the
other<00:05:29.039> laptops<00:05:29.550> have<00:05:29.789> to<00:05:29.940> offer<00:05:30.090> sure<00:05:30.960> it

00:05:31.279 --> 00:05:31.289 
other laptops have to offer sure it

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:33.290 
other laptops have to offer sure it
might<00:05:31.530> be<00:05:31.710> not<00:05:31.889> as<00:05:32.099> competitively<00:05:32.819> priced<00:05:33.030> as

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:33.300 
might be not as competitively priced as

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.550 
might be not as competitively priced as
some<00:05:33.690> of<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.840> laptops<00:05:34.229> that<00:05:34.409> we've

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
some of the laptops that we've

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.320 
some of the laptops that we've
previously<00:05:34.770> mentioned<00:05:35.219> but<00:05:35.460> I<00:05:35.520> think<00:05:35.909> the

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:36.330 
previously mentioned but I think the

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.749 
previously mentioned but I think the
experience<00:05:36.569> definitely<00:05:37.530> makes<00:05:37.680> up<00:05:37.889> for<00:05:38.520> any

00:05:38.749 --> 00:05:38.759 
experience definitely makes up for any

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:40.879 
experience definitely makes up for any
of<00:05:38.969> that<00:05:39.150> price<00:05:39.509> difference<00:05:40.020> for<00:05:40.289> sure<00:05:40.319> so

00:05:40.879 --> 00:05:40.889 
of that price difference for sure so

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:41.990 
of that price difference for sure so
definitely<00:05:41.340> let<00:05:41.430> me<00:05:41.490> know<00:05:41.580> what<00:05:41.819> you<00:05:41.909> guys
