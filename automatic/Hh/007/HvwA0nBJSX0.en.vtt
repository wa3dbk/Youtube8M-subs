00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
that much like feed the beast it's going
to<00:00:33.360> need<00:00:33.540> its<00:00:33.870> own<00:00:34.050> directory<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:35.040> you

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
to need its own directory so when you

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.930 
to need its own directory so when you
download<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.700> jar<00:00:36.540> or<00:00:36.870> the<00:00:37.079> exe<00:00:37.770> put<00:00:38.730> it<00:00:38.850> in

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
its own folder because the first time

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.080 
its own folder because the first time
you<00:00:40.800> run<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.160> going<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.520> create<00:00:41.760> all<00:00:41.910> these

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
you run it's going to create all these

you can create a shortcut onto your

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
create another quick launch bar up here

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.310 
create another quick launch bar up here
or<00:00:56.070> something<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.940> make<00:00:57.629> it<00:00:57.780> blend<00:00:58.020> in<00:00:58.170> better

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
work hard to keep organized I decided to

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.020 
work hard to keep organized I decided to
make<00:01:03.719> this<00:01:04.049> video<00:01:04.290> because<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.460> few<00:01:05.729> days<00:01:05.880> ago

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
make this video because a few days ago

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.260 
make this video because a few days ago
my<00:01:06.299> friend<00:01:06.570> Tim<00:01:06.780> launched<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.799> server<00:01:08.790> running

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
my friend Tim launched a server running

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.770 
my friend Tim launched a server running
resident<00:01:09.810> rise<00:01:09.990> 3<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.970> we're<00:01:11.970> all<00:01:12.030> switching

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
resident rise 3 and we're all switching

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.929 
resident rise 3 and we're all switching
over<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.619> from<00:01:14.010> feed<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.580> beast<00:01:14.760> because

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
over to that from feed the beast because

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.060 
over to that from feed the beast because
the<00:01:15.240> server<00:01:15.479> we<00:01:15.720> normally<00:01:16.110> play<00:01:16.290> on<00:01:16.380> there<00:01:16.860> is

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
the server we normally play on there is

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.249 
the server we normally play on there is
kind<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.759> under<00:01:18.360> some<00:01:18.540> work<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.080> in<00:01:19.229> the

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
kind of under some work so in the

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.350 
kind of under some work so in the
meantime<00:01:19.470> we're<00:01:19.890> gonna<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.640> playing<00:01:20.790> resident

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
meantime we're gonna be playing resident

meantime we're gonna be playing resident
rise<00:01:21.479> 3<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.840> I'll<00:01:21.900> probably<00:01:22.080> release<00:01:22.830> some

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
rise 3 and I'll probably release some

Let's Plays of that or something of that
nature<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.860> I<00:01:26.130> decided<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> do<00:01:26.970> this<00:01:27.090> video

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
nature and I decided to do this video

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.200 
nature and I decided to do this video
because<00:01:28.250> most<00:01:29.250> of<00:01:29.340> our<00:01:29.460> friends<00:01:29.670> are<00:01:29.880> jumping

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
because most of our friends are jumping

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.910 
because most of our friends are jumping
over<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.540> play<00:01:30.689> on<00:01:30.840> our<00:01:30.960> server<00:01:31.200> with<00:01:31.470> us<00:01:31.680> of

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
over to play on our server with us of

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.969 
over to play on our server with us of
course<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:33.750> easier<00:01:34.110> to<00:01:34.530> kind<00:01:34.860> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
course and it's easier to kind of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.340 
course and it's easier to kind of
demonstrate<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.909> this<00:01:36.270> works<00:01:36.570> compared<00:01:37.140> to

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
demonstrate how this works compared to

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.410 
demonstrate how this works compared to
feed<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.890> beast<00:01:38.130> rather<00:01:38.520> than<00:01:38.790> have<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> type

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
feed the beast rather than have to type

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090 
feed the beast rather than have to type
everything<00:01:39.720> in<00:01:39.960> steam<00:01:40.200> chat<00:01:40.409> or<00:01:40.590> talk<00:01:41.070> about

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
everything in steam chat or talk about

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.240 
everything in steam chat or talk about
on<00:01:41.460> teamspeak<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:43.380> hopefully<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.100> is

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
on teamspeak so hopefully this is

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.200 
on teamspeak so hopefully this is
helpful<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.030> guys<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.930> any<00:01:46.680> other

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
helpful to you guys and any other

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.139 
helpful to you guys and any other
viewers<00:01:48.210> that<00:01:48.420> decide<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.200> come<00:01:49.380> through<00:01:49.590> here

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:50.149 
viewers that decide to come through here

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.749 
viewers that decide to come through here
so<00:01:51.149> once<00:01:51.689> you<00:01:51.810> launch<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.320> it's<00:01:52.979> going<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.430> take

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
so once you launch it it's going to take

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.090 
so once you launch it it's going to take
a<00:01:53.790> while<00:01:54.060> to<00:01:54.090> load<00:01:54.450> up<00:01:54.810> it's<00:01:55.740> going<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.920> take

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
a while to load up it's going to take

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.639 
a while to load up it's going to take
longer<00:01:56.340> than<00:01:56.640> mine<00:01:57.180> has<00:01:57.450> just<00:01:57.780> now<00:01:57.960> because<00:01:58.380> it

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
longer than mine has just now because it

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.990 
longer than mine has just now because it
will<00:01:58.740> have<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.130> make<00:01:59.250> all<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> other<00:01:59.610> folders

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
will have to make all the other folders

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.459 
will have to make all the other folders
and<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.299> on<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:00.509> so<00:02:00.719> forth<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> first<00:02:01.229> time

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
and so on and so forth the first time

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.580 
and so on and so forth the first time
you<00:02:01.619> launch<00:02:02.360> every<00:02:03.360> time<00:02:03.570> you<00:02:03.719> launch<00:02:03.990> it's

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
you launch every time you launch it's

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:05.959 
you launch every time you launch it's

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.059 
going to bring you to the new screen
first<00:02:06.299> and<00:02:07.049> as<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.350> see<00:02:07.500> it's<00:02:07.649> got<00:02:07.799> tabs

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
first and as you can see it's got tabs

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.109 
first and as you can see it's got tabs
similar<00:02:08.580> to<00:02:08.879> feed<00:02:09.300> the<00:02:09.420> beast

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
similar to feed the beast

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:13.320 
similar to feed the beast
and<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.560> one<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.010> I<00:02:12.040> wish<00:02:12.430> was<00:02:12.670> still<00:02:12.910> here

and the one that I wish was still here

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.270 
and the one that I wish was still here
compared<00:02:13.900> to<00:02:13.959> feed<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.260> beast<00:02:14.440> is<00:02:14.680> the

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
compared to feed the beast is the

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
compared to feed the beast is the
texture<00:02:15.670> tab

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
texture tab

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.440

00:03:43.729 --> 00:03:43.739 
so before it starts downloading right

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:46.610 
so before it starts downloading right
away<00:03:44.010> this<00:03:44.760> is<00:03:45.000> other<00:03:45.450> part<00:03:45.900> where<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.380> differs

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
away this is other part where it differs

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.940 
away this is other part where it differs
in<00:03:47.010> the<00:03:47.069> fact<00:03:47.760> that<00:03:47.989> it's<00:03:48.989> going<00:03:49.380> to<00:03:49.470> have<00:03:49.739> all

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
in the fact that it's going to have all

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.809

00:03:52.809 --> 00:03:52.819 
the required mods over here and then

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:55.160 
the required mods over here and then
