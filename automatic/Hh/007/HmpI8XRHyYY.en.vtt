00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 good kids we are here in a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.609
 new gta 5 video online and good 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.560
 this time I come to teach you how to tune 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.849
 my new ader that good as I have seen 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.950
 that for the videos and that you liked 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.389
 a lot that is collecting a little bit 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.429
 more use when doing now also for 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.320
 vary from the environment also in circuits 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.109
 that have a lot of lupine and that I need a 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.980
 car like the one on the right that does not 

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.170
 stumble so to speak as the 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.519
 environment and good because it is a color that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.990
 we really loved it because it 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.449
 see as well as dark in the shadow and 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.670
 later when when the sun hits 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.500
 it looks like pink and strong the truth is 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.820
 I was pretty handsome and I do not know how 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.230
 that is going to change color and is what 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.940
 that really makes me feel great about cars 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.700
 it is not similar to the blue of my surroundings 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.680
 but in purple so nothing then we go 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 there I will see if I can recreate it 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.070
 to explain how it is more or less me 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.270
 agreement so it will not be very difficult and 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.239
 Well here we go I'll show you how 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:50.160
 this piece of color is made we enter 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.470
 the Saints 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.910
 let's prepare ourselves I think I have it in 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.200
 the mind more or less as it may be worth 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.570
 so I think it's not going to be very difficult 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.720
 recreate it the first thing we're going to do 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.450
 is to take and the paint we are going to remove 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:07.350
 so let's put this because the color 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.700
 classic so that it is already normal 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.000
 ok and good, now starting from 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.130
 zero what we are going to do is recreate it 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.009
 first of all here where we have 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.800
 the lights in the neon kit is color of the 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.270
 neon we are going to put pink strong vale for 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.310
 let that effect stay 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.660
 pretty cool in the car and well 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.640
 the neon design we are going to put 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.310
 Front back and side if you have 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.090
 money and if not then what you can worth 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:35.220
 good painting let's go here main color 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.780
 ok had to give a turn that the 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.369
 final I have not found so good 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 so let's go there we have to put 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.810
 metallic color the first one we were going to 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.200
 put it even seems crazy 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.869
 midnight blue to see blue midnight 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.460
 it's worth this blue that is the same as 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.470
 used for the sector is not worth it but already 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.700
 you will see how the blue change will be 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.909
 midnight after we're going to go to 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.859
 pearly that will let us place 

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:00.109
 if we place the first metallized 

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:04.300
 midnight as I said and nacreous 

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:07.780
 We are going to put one that is 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.240
 this here to see this pink as strong 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.070
 you see automatically the effect that is 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.320
 It is this one here you are seeing 

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.300
 the truth is that I like it much more than 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.950
 if you put a purple whatever it is 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.990
 midnight blue mixed with pink 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.110
 strong and this effect stays very 

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:25.690
 very handsome and then nothing simply from 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.280
 pearly we put that after color 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.660
 secondary, then you will have 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:30.490
 you will have the lines of another color as 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.200
 you are seeing here what you have to 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:34.300
 to do is to put it if I'm not mistaken 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.330
 same is worth the metallic you put the 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.160
 midnight blue you come simply 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.860
 secondary color metallic blue 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.450
 midnight and automatically the pearly 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.040
 It also works for the color, so you 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:47.710
 puts on top of the secondary color also 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.170
 or will it be the same color to 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.880
 I liked it that way because I like everything 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.830
 the same color not if you want to put 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.930
 another color you to the bands then 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:57.880
 you can put the color you want pink 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.880
 whatever it is but for me it looks good 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:03.340
 more let's say uniform without changes of 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.540
 color is worth it as well as I like it so 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.860
 that nothing after and simply you 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.680
 we have to place the emblem of the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.690
 crew and pulling and if we have one color left 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.050
 of pretty handsome car to see I'm going to 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.170
 try out 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:16.510
 also the good wheel the wheel is that 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:19.000
 neither can you put anything like that in 

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.350
 plan as motorcycles are worth 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.250
 windows I've been saying I'm going to 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.520
 put this color there dark 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.050
 and good for you wheels come here 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.820
 color of the tires is that the only thing 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:31.620
 you can put is' â€‹â€‹if purple of the 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.720
 medium ball which is what I have 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.430
 so you can not put the purple 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.980
 dark but it looks like too black 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.810
 I prefer ss moradito and nothing kids 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.880
 Well simply this would be the result 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.280
 which is the leader that I am using 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.660
 lately you have seen a little 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.130
 on my channel and also on my channels 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.990
 companions and such and the truth is that no 

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.250
 I know it's pretty cool so nothing 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:52.500
 kids, I hope you liked it 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:54.959
 that this piece of aide that the 

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.790
 truth is that I do not know to me I'm cool they are not 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.800
 colors that make me cool about all this 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.450
 that they change color as they give more 

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.580
 sun less if it has the shadow so 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.750
 that's pretty cool the truth so nothing 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.120
 kids, I hope you liked it 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.040
 that you can already have the leader of Ivan 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.910
 forever and nothing see you in the next 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.910
 goodbye video 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:11.910
 and
