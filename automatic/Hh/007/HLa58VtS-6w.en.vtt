 I am a graduate in nutrition today I want 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.110
 talk about a body logic product 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.610
 which is chlorophyll, chlorophyll is a 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.130
 natural product that comes 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.830
 mainly plant the 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.080
 plants the chlorophyll acts as if it were 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.730
 photosynthesis and helps give oxygen to 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.740
 plants so good in our body goes 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 to give a very important benefit because 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.300
 there is a group of people who are very 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.510
 very intoxicated this is intoxication 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.510
 they are given because they are not in your gut 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.850
 it is not working properly not 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 they are evacuating two to three times 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.950
 day and what happens that is in your 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.070
 intestine is still decomposing and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.260
 begins to create toxins these toxins 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.020
 they begin to run through the torrent 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:55.710
 literal blood people are 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.239
 feeding your waste when this 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.660
 happens people usually 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.030
 they have more fatigue and apathy there 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.970
 people who have this depression and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.340
 they also tend to have bad breath 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.020
 there are people whose sweat is stronger 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.390
 than others because their degree of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 intoxication is higher than that of 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.850
 others the chlorophyll will act to help 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.680

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.940
 intestine also to start 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.490
 work that has a better 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.860
 functioning to that toxins that 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 they are also in the bloodstream 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.810
 begin to decrease and that their 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.210
