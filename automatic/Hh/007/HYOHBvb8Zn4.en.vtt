first thing that I'm going to talk about
is<00:00:56.129> weaving<00:00:56.520> this<00:00:56.670> weaving<00:00:57.449> nets<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:58.079> great

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
is weaving this weaving nets are great

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.950 
is weaving this weaving nets are great
and<00:00:58.859> best<00:00:59.280> for<00:00:59.579> people<00:00:59.699> who<00:01:00.059> have<00:01:00.300> thin<00:01:00.719> or

thinning hair lines weak edges or just
overall<00:01:03.809> thin<00:01:04.350> hair<00:01:04.650> what<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> weaving<00:01:05.700> that

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
overall thin hair what the weaving that

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.510 
overall thin hair what the weaving that
does<00:01:06.150> is<00:01:06.510> it<00:01:06.720> provides<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:07.680> of<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:07.979> base<00:01:08.250> on

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
does is it provides more of a base on

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.580 
does is it provides more of a base on
their<00:01:08.640> entire<00:01:09.000> head<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:09.900> way<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.439> weight

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
their entire head so that way the weight

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.649 
their entire head so that way the weight
of<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> extensions<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:11.640> not<00:01:11.820> relying<00:01:12.240> on<00:01:12.390> the

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
of the extensions is not relying on the

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.359 
of the extensions is not relying on the
strength<00:01:12.960> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.170> hair<00:01:13.350> but<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.920> strength<00:01:14.220> of

strength of the hair but the strength of

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.090 
strength of the hair but the strength of
the<00:01:14.520> weaving<00:01:14.850> net<00:01:15.000> so<00:01:15.540> depending<00:01:16.140> on<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.710> thin

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
the weaving net so depending on how thin

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.969 
the weaving net so depending on how thin
or<00:01:17.430> how<00:01:17.790> much<00:01:18.030> help<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:18.600> support<00:01:19.049> someone<00:01:19.560> hair

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
or how much help or support someone hair

will<00:01:21.750> depend<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.290> type<00:01:22.500> of<00:01:22.530> weaving<00:01:23.040> that

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
will depend on the type of weaving that

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.460 
will depend on the type of weaving that
you<00:01:23.310> use<00:01:23.610> so<00:01:24.240> if<00:01:24.330> you<00:01:24.450> use<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> weaving<00:01:25.200> net<00:01:25.290> is

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
you use so if you use a weaving net is

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
you use so if you use a weaving net is
very<00:01:25.680> flexible<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.430> flimsy<00:01:27.000> and<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.540> move

very flexible and flimsy and can move

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.690 
very flexible and flimsy and can move
around<00:01:27.810> very<00:01:27.960> easily<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:29.100> could<00:01:29.280> help<00:01:29.430> for

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
around very easily that could help for

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.819 
around very easily that could help for
someone<00:01:29.939> who<00:01:30.240> has<00:01:30.479> thin<00:01:30.750> hair<00:01:30.780> but<00:01:31.500> doesn't

thinning hairline you want to use a

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.760 
thinning hairline you want to use a
weaving<00:01:38.729> net<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.090> is<00:01:39.240> stiff<00:01:39.600> because<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.530> can

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
weaving net that is stiff because it can

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.800 
weaving net that is stiff because it can
hold<00:01:40.979> more<00:01:41.159> weight<00:01:41.579> if<00:01:41.820> they<00:01:42.000> do<00:01:42.060> decide<00:01:42.540> to

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
hold more weight if they do decide to

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.899 
hold more weight if they do decide to
add<00:01:42.930> more<00:01:43.200> extensions<00:01:43.619> onto<00:01:43.829> their<00:01:44.100> hair<00:01:44.369> so

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
add more extensions onto their hair so

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.460 
add more extensions onto their hair so
that<00:01:45.119> way<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.540> weight<00:01:45.689> of<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> extensions

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
a weaving net for my next tip I'm going

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.039 
a weaving net for my next tip I'm going
to<00:01:56.280> suggest<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:57.030> a<00:01:57.180> weaving<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:57.899> is

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
to suggest is that a weaving that is

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.630 
to suggest is that a weaving that is
perfect<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.829> people<00:01:59.189> who<00:01:59.340> are<00:01:59.430> suffering

very healthy hair in good condition but

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.729 
very healthy hair in good condition but
they<00:03:44.420> want<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.750> make<00:03:44.900> sure<00:03:44.930> that<00:03:45.350> all<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.500> their
