will<00:03:20.090> be<00:03:20.209> looking<00:03:20.540> at<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.750> later<00:03:20.959> but<00:03:21.380> anyway

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
will be looking at it later but anyway

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.220 
will be looking at it later but anyway
I'm<00:03:22.880> pretty<00:03:23.090> sure<00:03:23.239> the<00:03:23.389> pricing<00:03:23.720> will<00:03:23.870> be<00:03:23.989> fair

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.230 
I'm pretty sure the pricing will be fair

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.430 
I'm pretty sure the pricing will be fair
it's<00:03:24.530> kind<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.829> sucky<00:03:25.190> that<00:03:25.370> if<00:03:25.700> you<00:03:25.819> own<00:03:25.970> it<00:03:26.120> on

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:26.440 
it's kind of sucky that if you own it on

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.349 
it's kind of sucky that if you own it on
while<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.620> older<00:03:28.069> older<00:03:28.489> generation

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
while the older older generation

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:30.400 
while the older older generation
consoles<00:03:29.720> that<00:03:29.780> you<00:03:29.930> don't<00:03:30.109> get<00:03:30.230> like<00:03:30.380> a

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
consoles that you don't get like a

consoles that you don't get like a
discount<00:03:30.889> or<00:03:30.980> something<00:03:31.040> that'd<00:03:31.459> be<00:03:31.609> really

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
discount or something that'd be really

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.309 
discount or something that'd be really
nice<00:03:32.060> if<00:03:32.090> they<00:03:32.419> actually<00:03:32.510> give<00:03:32.780> you<00:03:32.900> discount

00:03:33.309 --> 00:03:33.319 
nice if they actually give you discount

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.069 
nice if they actually give you discount

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
going to an Xbox one so you'd have to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:43.809

kind of silly but Dad whatever whatever
but<00:03:49.099> this<00:03:49.250> count<00:03:49.489> would<00:03:49.639> be<00:03:49.669> just<00:03:50.380> generous

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:51.380

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
and console updates so whilst our will

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.860 
and console updates so whilst our will
always<00:04:13.549> be<00:04:13.699> challenges<00:04:14.269> in<00:04:14.419> bringing<00:04:14.750> that

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:14.870 
always be challenges in bringing that

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:17.289 
always be challenges in bringing that
content<00:04:15.319> to<00:04:15.440> console<00:04:15.859> platforms<00:04:16.070> will<00:04:16.940> be

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
content to console platforms will be

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.089 
content to console platforms will be
breaking<00:04:17.630> updates<00:04:18.229> down<00:04:18.530> into<00:04:18.829> more

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:19.099 
breaking updates down into more

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:21.410 
bite-sized chunks in the future so we

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:23.200 
bite-sized chunks in the future so we
could<00:04:21.560> differ<00:04:21.709> so<00:04:22.219> we<00:04:22.310> can<00:04:22.460> deliver<00:04:22.729> that<00:04:22.820> more

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
could differ so we can deliver that more

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.899 
could differ so we can deliver that more
quickly<00:04:23.450> from<00:04:23.719> now<00:04:23.870> on<00:04:24.110> so<00:04:24.830> I<00:04:24.860> kind<00:04:25.610> of<00:04:25.669> like

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.000 
quickly from now on so I kind of like
this<00:04:26.120> idea

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
this idea

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:28.830 
this idea
I like<00:04:27.490> the<00:04:27.610> idea<00:04:27.700> of<00:04:27.880> having<00:04:28.210> small

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
that that would actually mean that that

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.690 
that that would actually mean that that
they<00:04:40.300> could<00:04:40.510> easily<00:04:41.070> they<00:04:42.070> can<00:04:42.100> easily<00:04:42.490> manage

bite-sized<00:04:54.580> stuff<00:04:54.850> but<00:04:55.390> pc<00:04:55.750> i<00:04:55.960> need<00:04:56.350> my<00:04:56.560> giant

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.040 
bite-sized stuff but pc i need my giant

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.040 
bite-sized stuff but pc i need my giant
packs<00:04:57.250> but<00:04:57.550> that's<00:04:57.820> why<00:04:58.030> 505<00:04:58.600> games<00:04:58.630> is

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050
