today<00:00:58.079> well<00:00:58.469> what's<00:00:58.770> interesting<00:00:59.160> Jeff<00:00:59.609> it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
today well what's interesting Jeff it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.520 
today well what's interesting Jeff it
made<00:00:59.910> me<00:01:00.090> realize<00:01:00.629> that<00:01:00.870> as<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.170> talked<00:01:01.440> about

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
made me realize that as you talked about

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.860 
made me realize that as you talked about
Jupiter<00:01:02.190> being<00:01:02.430> bigger<00:01:02.910> than<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.719> other

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
Jupiter being bigger than all the other

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.950 
Jupiter being bigger than all the other
planets<00:01:04.290> put<00:01:04.500> together<00:01:05.090> Pluto<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.119> smaller

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
planets put together Pluto is smaller

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
planets put together Pluto is smaller
than<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> other<00:01:07.770> planets<00:01:08.159> taken<00:01:08.460> apart

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
than all the other planets taken apart

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.420 
than all the other planets taken apart
so<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.060> speak<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.220> concentrated<00:01:11.220> it

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
so to speak right it is concentrated it

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.450 
so to speak right it is concentrated it
is<00:01:11.729> focused<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:13.020> it's<00:01:13.320> intense<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.280> like

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
is focused it is it's intense it's like

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.880 
is focused it is it's intense it's like
it's<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.420> intensity<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.439> energy

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
it's like the intensity of the energy

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.820 
it's like the intensity of the energy
and<00:01:17.040> an<00:01:17.159> atomic<00:01:17.729> bomb<00:01:18.000> that's<00:01:18.509> how<00:01:18.689> compact<00:01:19.590> it

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and an atomic bomb that's how compact it

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.249 
and an atomic bomb that's how compact it
is<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.360> because<00:01:21.930> it's<00:01:22.110> an

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
is and you're right this because it's an

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.200 
is and you're right this because it's an
opposition<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.189> can<00:01:23.549> play<00:01:23.820> out<00:01:23.970> in

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
opposition it can play out in

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.780 
opposition it can play out in
relationships<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.530> so<00:01:25.799> we<00:01:25.979> do<00:01:26.340> find

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
relationships and so we do find

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.780 
relationships and so we do find
ourselves<00:01:27.320> being<00:01:28.320> confronted<00:01:29.009> by<00:01:29.220> or

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
ourselves being confronted by or

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.569 
ourselves being confronted by or
confronting<00:01:30.570> someone<00:01:30.900> about<00:01:31.710> their<00:01:32.130> beliefs

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
confronting someone about their beliefs

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.910 
confronting someone about their beliefs
are<00:01:32.909> trying<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.390> deflate<00:01:33.990> something<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.710> is
