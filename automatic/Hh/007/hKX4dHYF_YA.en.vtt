bit less you know a little bit lighter
weight<00:01:48.650> things<00:01:49.250> like<00:01:49.490> that<00:01:49.730> a<00:01:49.760> change<00:01:50.300> of

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
weight things like that a change of

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.770 
weight things like that a change of

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
materials this shoe actually weighs 12.5

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.800 
materials this shoe actually weighs 12.5
ounces<00:01:54.230> and<00:01:54.440> the<00:01:55.040> original<00:01:55.700> CP<00:01:55.940> 3.6<00:01:56.570> in<00:01:56.720> the

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
ounces and the original CP 3.6 in the

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.430 
ounces and the original CP 3.6 in the
same<00:01:56.990> exact<00:01:57.290> size<00:01:57.670> are<00:01:58.670> not<00:01:58.730> CB<00:01:59.090> 360<00:01:59.630> p37<00:02:00.050> sorry

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
same exact size are not CB 360 p37 sorry

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.740 
same exact size are not CB 360 p37 sorry
and<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.220> same<00:02:01.370> exact<00:02:01.610> size<00:02:01.790> weighs<00:02:02.150> twelve

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:02.750 
and the same exact size weighs twelve

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.260 
and the same exact size weighs twelve
point<00:02:02.960> six<00:02:03.110> ounces<00:02:03.470> so<00:02:03.680> you're<00:02:04.220> not<00:02:04.940> really

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
point six ounces so you're not really

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.670 
point six ounces so you're not really
changing<00:02:05.360> the<00:02:05.900> weight<00:02:06.080> or<00:02:06.260> anything<00:02:06.320> like

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
changing the weight or anything like

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.100 
changing the weight or anything like
that<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.070> deciding<00:02:07.550> factor<00:02:07.910> between<00:02:08.300> the

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
that the deciding factor between the

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.020 
that the deciding factor between the
differences<00:02:09.710> between<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.190> two<00:02:10.340> is<00:02:10.550> that<00:02:10.759> in

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
differences between the two is that in

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.970 
differences between the two is that in
the<00:02:11.210> materials<00:02:11.690> themselves<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.680> as<00:02:12.710> you<00:02:12.890> can

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the materials themselves so as you can

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:13.880 
the materials themselves so as you can
see<00:02:13.040> here

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
see here

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.730 
see here
we<00:02:14.880> have<00:02:15.150> a<00:02:15.180> few<00:02:15.660> supper<00:02:16.050> and<00:02:16.260> then<00:02:16.500> we<00:02:16.590> have

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
we have a few supper and then we have

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.210 
we have a few supper and then we have
some<00:02:17.220> mesh<00:02:17.460> the<00:02:17.760> mesh<00:02:17.790> actually<00:02:18.420> is<00:02:18.690> a<00:02:19.070> that<00:02:20.070> it

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
some mesh the mesh actually is a that it

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.280 
some mesh the mesh actually is a that it
does<00:02:20.430> not<00:02:20.580> allow<00:02:20.940> air<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.210> flow<00:02:21.540> in<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:21.990> out<00:02:22.050> so

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
does not allow air to flow in and out so

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.820 
does not allow air to flow in and out so
the<00:02:22.470> mesh<00:02:22.860> is<00:02:23.100> not<00:02:23.550> a<00:02:23.790> well<00:02:24.090> ventilated

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
the mesh is not a well ventilated

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:28.100 
the mesh is not a well ventilated
section<00:02:25.830> of<00:02:26.010> the<00:02:26.100> shoe<00:02:26.420> it's<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.750> there<00:02:27.930> for

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
section of the shoe it's just there for

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:29.570 
section of the shoe it's just there for
that<00:02:28.260> kind<00:02:28.500> of<00:02:28.560> like<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.220> bonding

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
that kind of like that that bonding

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.280 
that kind of like that that bonding
process<00:02:30.030> that's<00:02:30.270> just<00:02:30.450> how<00:02:30.540> they<00:02:30.720> put

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
process that's just how they put

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.500 
process that's just how they put
together<00:02:31.380> the<00:02:31.710> three<00:02:31.980> layers<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.910> underlay

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
together the three layers the underlay

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.780 
together the three layers the underlay
the<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.500> middle<00:02:34.680> layer<00:02:35.160> which<00:02:35.370> is<00:02:35.400> usually

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
the the middle layer which is usually

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.250 
the the middle layer which is usually
mesh<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.180> then<00:02:36.270> the<00:02:36.360> overlay<00:02:36.690> material<00:02:37.110> which

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
mesh and then the overlay material which

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:40.040 
mesh and then the overlay material which
is<00:02:37.410> like<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:38.030> knots<00:02:39.030> as<00:02:39.180> well<00:02:39.630> it's<00:02:39.810> kind<00:02:40.020> of

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
is like the knots as well it's kind of

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.510 
is like the knots as well it's kind of
the<00:02:40.170> support<00:02:40.530> but<00:02:40.740> I'm<00:02:41.130> just<00:02:41.250> like<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
the support but I'm just like the

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.740 
the support but I'm just like the
protection<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.150> things<00:02:42.300> like<00:02:42.390> that<00:02:42.540> gives

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
protection and things like that gives

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.600 
protection and things like that gives
you<00:02:42.810> the<00:02:43.170> look<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.310> color<00:02:44.550> and

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
you the look and the color and

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.400 
you the look and the color and
everything<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.120> under<00:02:45.360> the<00:02:45.930> first<00:02:46.200> layer<00:02:46.380> is

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
everything that under the first layer is

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.160 
everything that under the first layer is
actually<00:02:46.890> a<00:02:46.920> support<00:02:47.340> section<00:02:47.670> but<00:02:47.850> um<00:02:48.170> so

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
actually a support section but um so

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.350 
actually a support section but um so
yeah<00:02:49.320> so<00:02:49.500> these<00:02:49.620> guys<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.190> they<00:02:50.760> use<00:02:50.970> you

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
yeah so these guys here they use you

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.690 
yeah so these guys here they use you
know<00:02:51.450> new-school<00:02:52.370> technology<00:02:53.370> and<00:02:53.550> things

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
know new-school technology and things

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.310 
know new-school technology and things
like<00:02:53.820> that<00:02:53.880> it's<00:02:54.209> interesting<00:02:54.480> because<00:02:54.840> last

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
like that it's interesting because last

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.620 
like that it's interesting because last
year's<00:02:55.590> model<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:55.980> CP<00:02:56.250> 3.6<00:02:56.850> they<00:02:57.360> actually

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:57.630 
year's model the CP 3.6 they actually

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.090 
year's model the CP 3.6 they actually
started<00:02:57.990> out<00:02:58.080> looking<00:02:58.410> like<00:02:58.440> this<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:59.010> then

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
started out looking like this and then

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.280 
started out looking like this and then
the<00:02:59.340> playoff<00:02:59.850> model<00:03:00.240> they<00:03:00.690> use<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> little<00:03:01.200> bit

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
the playoff model they use a little bit

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.380 
the playoff model they use a little bit
more<00:03:01.350> premium<00:03:02.000> materials<00:03:03.000> with<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.270> new

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
more premium materials with the new

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.760 
more premium materials with the new
bucks<00:03:03.630> and<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:03.870> leathers<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.470> things<00:03:04.620> like

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
bucks and the leathers and things like

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.490 
bucks and the leathers and things like
that<00:03:04.880> whereas<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.090> year<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:06.810> used<00:03:07.200> a

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
that whereas this year they used a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.980 
that whereas this year they used a
leather<00:03:08.459> based<00:03:08.760> model<00:03:09.240> so<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:09.600> use<00:03:09.750> premium

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:09.990 
leather based model so they use premium

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.720 
leather based model so they use premium
materials<00:03:10.530> first<00:03:10.740> and<00:03:11.040> then<00:03:11.130> for<00:03:11.310> the<00:03:11.400> playoff

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
materials first and then for the playoff

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.949 
materials first and then for the playoff
version<00:03:12.120> they<00:03:12.240> went<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.600> this<00:03:12.720> type<00:03:12.930> of

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
version they went with this type of

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.980 
version they went with this type of
setup<00:03:13.260> which<00:03:13.530> is<00:03:13.709> a<00:03:13.740> more<00:03:14.070> modern<00:03:14.310> setup<00:03:14.990> now

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:15.990 
setup which is a more modern setup now

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
setup which is a more modern setup now
the<00:03:16.050> reason<00:03:16.350> why<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> think<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:16.770> it's<00:03:16.890> gonna

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
the reason why I think that it's gonna

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.530 
the reason why I think that it's gonna
play<00:03:17.190> slightly<00:03:17.820> different<00:03:18.209> than<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.390> other

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
play slightly different than the other

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:19.729 
play slightly different than the other
ones<00:03:18.720> is<00:03:18.870> because<00:03:18.900> the<00:03:19.260> materials<00:03:19.650> themselves

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:19.739 
ones is because the materials themselves

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.800 
ones is because the materials themselves
like<00:03:20.130> I<00:03:20.220> was<00:03:20.340> saying<00:03:20.550> they're<00:03:21.420> using

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
like I was saying they're using

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.300 
like I was saying they're using
something<00:03:22.050> that<00:03:22.260> has<00:03:22.410> literally<00:03:23.160> zero

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
something that has literally zero

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:24.290 
something that has literally zero
stretch<00:03:23.910> to<00:03:24.150> it

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:24.300 
stretch to it

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:27.350 
stretch to it
leather<00:03:25.230> new<00:03:25.950> buck<00:03:26.160> raw<00:03:26.640> material<00:03:27.150> such<00:03:27.330> as

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
leather new buck raw material such as

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.170 
leather new buck raw material such as
that<00:03:28.070> they<00:03:29.070> actually<00:03:29.220> will<00:03:29.550> stretch<00:03:29.850> after

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
that they actually will stretch after

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.660 
that they actually will stretch after
you<00:03:30.239> break<00:03:30.450> them<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.230> if<00:03:31.890> any<00:03:32.130> of<00:03:32.250> you<00:03:32.519> guys

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
you break them in so if any of you guys

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.610 
you break them in so if any of you guys
playing<00:03:32.940> like<00:03:33.209> retros<00:03:33.660> or<00:03:33.930> or<00:03:34.350> shoes<00:03:34.590> that

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
playing like retros or or shoes that

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.650 
playing like retros or or shoes that
have<00:03:34.890> that<00:03:35.010> type<00:03:35.070> of<00:03:35.340> material<00:03:35.760> you'll<00:03:36.390> notice

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
have that type of material you'll notice

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.060 
have that type of material you'll notice
that<00:03:36.750> you're<00:03:36.930> constantly<00:03:37.110> readjusting<00:03:38.010> your

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:38.070 
that you're constantly readjusting your

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.220 
that you're constantly readjusting your
laces<00:03:38.519> to<00:03:39.239> get<00:03:39.390> that<00:03:39.540> tight<00:03:39.780> fit<00:03:40.050> because

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
laces to get that tight fit because

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.840 
laces to get that tight fit because
those<00:03:40.590> shoes<00:03:40.860> are<00:03:41.010> always<00:03:41.250> stretching<00:03:41.580> it's

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
those shoes are always stretching it's

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.500 
those shoes are always stretching it's
it's<00:03:42.120> basically<00:03:42.540> skin<00:03:43.100> so<00:03:44.100> with<00:03:44.730> a<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:45.420> know

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
it's basically skin so with a you know

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.240 
it's basically skin so with a you know
synthetic<00:03:46.019> material<00:03:46.470> such<00:03:46.650> as<00:03:46.830> this<00:03:46.980> or<00:03:47.220> a

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
synthetic material such as this or a

synthetic material such as this or a
man-made<00:03:47.580> material<00:03:47.880> which<00:03:48.390> is<00:03:48.570> the<00:03:48.720> fuse<00:03:49.019> or

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
man-made material which is the fuse or

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.350 
man-made material which is the fuse or
plastic<00:03:49.739> whatever<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.820> is<00:03:50.910> that<00:03:51.090> you'd<00:03:51.239> like

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:51.360 
plastic whatever it is that you'd like

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.390 
plastic whatever it is that you'd like
to<00:03:51.420> call<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.780> there's<00:03:51.959> zero<00:03:52.200> stretch<00:03:52.590> so<00:03:53.190> it's

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
to call it there's zero stretch so it's

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.280 
to call it there's zero stretch so it's
ultimate<00:03:53.850> containment<00:03:54.420> which<00:03:54.810> is<00:03:55.019> going<00:03:55.230> to

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
ultimate containment which is going to

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.110 
ultimate containment which is going to
be<00:03:55.380> good<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.950> players<00:03:56.370> that<00:03:56.610> are<00:03:56.700> like<00:03:56.880> Chris

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
be good for players that are like Chris

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.150 
be good for players that are like Chris
Paul<00:03:57.150> or<00:03:57.870> constantly<00:03:58.560> moving

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
Paul or constantly moving

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.070 
Paul or constantly moving
you<00:03:59.459> know<00:03:59.610> zigging<00:04:00.060> slashing<00:04:00.660> things<00:04:00.930> like

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:01.080 
you know zigging slashing things like

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.900 
you know zigging slashing things like
that<00:04:01.320> starting<00:04:02.220> stopping<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.760> guy's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
that starting stopping the guy's

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:05.960 
that starting stopping the guy's
footwork<00:04:03.660> is<00:04:03.840> incredible<00:04:04.380> so<00:04:04.890> this<00:04:05.640> type<00:04:05.850> of

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
footwork is incredible so this type of

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.509 
footwork is incredible so this type of
containment<00:04:06.390> fort<00:04:07.320> his<00:04:07.470> shoe<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:08.010> almost

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
containment fort his shoe is almost

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.880 
containment fort his shoe is almost
perfect<00:04:08.970> for<00:04:09.150> him<00:04:09.330> as<00:04:09.750> far<00:04:09.989> as<00:04:10.049> the<00:04:10.170> fly<00:04:10.620> wire

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
perfect for him as far as the fly wire

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.130 
perfect for him as far as the fly wire
goes<00:04:11.190> this<00:04:11.790> is<00:04:11.970> definitely<00:04:12.420> the<00:04:12.540> most<00:04:12.720> dynamic

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
goes this is definitely the most dynamic

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.199 
goes this is definitely the most dynamic
I've<00:04:13.590> ever<00:04:13.799> seen<00:04:14.100> dynamic<00:04:14.580> fly<00:04:14.760> wire<00:04:14.970> it's

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
I've ever seen dynamic fly wire it's

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:18.590 
I've ever seen dynamic fly wire it's
like<00:04:15.330> really<00:04:15.630> crazy<00:04:16.250> these<00:04:17.250> points<00:04:18.209> here<00:04:18.390> they

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:18.600 
like really crazy these points here they

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.479 
like really crazy these points here they
are<00:04:18.780> actually<00:04:19.200> you<00:04:19.530> know<00:04:19.560> into<00:04:20.010> the<00:04:20.130> footbed

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
are actually you know into the footbed

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:22.010 
are actually you know into the footbed
here<00:04:20.790> and<00:04:20.940> then<00:04:21.330> they're<00:04:21.510> attached<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:21.810> the

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:22.020 
here and then they're attached to the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.490 
here and then they're attached to the
lacing<00:04:22.380> system<00:04:22.530> with<00:04:22.890> this<00:04:23.180> other<00:04:24.180> weird<00:04:25.050> so

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
lacing system with this other weird so

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.620 
lacing system with this other weird so
it's<00:04:25.770> such<00:04:26.010> a<00:04:26.039> weird<00:04:26.340> set

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
it's such a weird set

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.530 
it's such a weird set
when<00:04:28.260> I<00:04:28.290> laced<00:04:29.070> them<00:04:29.250> up<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.639> you<00:04:30.030> know<00:04:30.150> did<00:04:30.330> hug

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
when I laced them up it you know did hug

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.820 
when I laced them up it you know did hug
and<00:04:30.720> wrap<00:04:30.840> around<00:04:31.080> your<00:04:31.169> foot<00:04:31.320> and<00:04:31.500> everything

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and wrap around your foot and everything

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.750 
and wrap around your foot and everything
how<00:04:32.310> durable<00:04:32.729> is<00:04:32.970> it<00:04:33.150> I<00:04:33.330> don't<00:04:33.840> know<00:04:33.960> I<00:04:34.760> mean

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
how durable is it I don't know I mean

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.070 
how durable is it I don't know I mean
I'm<00:04:36.030> sure<00:04:36.210> it's<00:04:36.389> not<00:04:36.510> going<00:04:36.630> to<00:04:36.720> be<00:04:36.810> any<00:04:36.960> more

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:37.080 
I'm sure it's not going to be any more

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.700 
I'm sure it's not going to be any more
durable<00:04:37.470> than<00:04:37.650> them<00:04:38.220> past<00:04:38.520> renditions<00:04:39.090> of

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:39.710 
durable than them past renditions of

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.580 
durable than them past renditions of
dynamic<00:04:40.710> fly<00:04:40.919> wires<00:04:41.160> so<00:04:41.430> you<00:04:42.000> know<00:04:42.419> it<00:04:43.199> is<00:04:43.410> what

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
dynamic fly wires so you know it is what

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:45.050 
dynamic fly wires so you know it is what
it<00:04:43.680> is<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:44.010> good<00:04:44.160> thing<00:04:44.340> is<00:04:44.520> is<00:04:44.790> that<00:04:44.940> you

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
it is the good thing is is that you

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.180 
it is the good thing is is that you
don't<00:04:45.240> actually<00:04:45.449> need<00:04:45.780> this<00:04:46.020> on<00:04:46.740> the<00:04:46.979> shoe

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
don't actually need this on the shoe

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:49.969 
don't actually need this on the shoe
because<00:04:47.400> you<00:04:47.760> have<00:04:47.940> fuse<00:04:48.389> so<00:04:48.870> if<00:04:49.710> these<00:04:49.919> were

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:49.979 
because you have fuse so if these were

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:52.370 
because you have fuse so if these were
to<00:04:50.250> break<00:04:50.460> or<00:04:50.699> you<00:04:50.729> cut<00:04:51.000> them<00:04:51.150> off<00:04:51.330> or<00:04:51.630> whatever

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
to break or you cut them off or whatever

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:54.140 
to break or you cut them off or whatever
it<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.560> that<00:04:52.740> you<00:04:52.800> choose<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:53.190> do<00:04:53.340> it's<00:04:54.030> not

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
it is that you choose to do it's not

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.850 
it is that you choose to do it's not
going<00:04:54.330> to<00:04:54.389> destroy<00:04:54.660> the<00:04:54.990> functionality<00:04:55.680> of

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
going to destroy the functionality of

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:58.040 
going to destroy the functionality of
the<00:04:56.010> shoe<00:04:56.190> so<00:04:56.669> that<00:04:56.970> pretty<00:04:57.479> much<00:04:57.570> everything

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
the shoe so that pretty much everything

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.779 
the shoe so that pretty much everything
it's<00:04:58.380> a<00:04:58.500> very<00:04:58.710> simple<00:04:59.190> kind<00:04:59.639> of

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
it's a very simple kind of

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.760 
it's a very simple kind of
straightforward<00:05:00.030> thing<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:00.630> you<00:05:01.470> know<00:05:01.560> we're

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
straightforward thing the you know we're

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.409 
straightforward thing the you know we're
testing<00:05:02.130> process<00:05:02.490> is<00:05:02.580> gonna<00:05:02.699> be<00:05:02.880> very<00:05:03.090> fast

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
testing process is gonna be very fast

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.689 
testing process is gonna be very fast
I'm<00:05:04.410> just<00:05:04.650> basically<00:05:04.919> gonna<00:05:05.220> have<00:05:05.430> to<00:05:05.520> break

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
I'm just basically gonna have to break

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.300 
I'm just basically gonna have to break
them<00:05:05.880> in<00:05:05.970> again<00:05:06.210> the<00:05:06.960> rubber<00:05:07.199> and<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.530> midsole

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
them in again the rubber and the midsole

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.189 
them in again the rubber and the midsole
I<00:05:08.340> remember<00:05:09.120> needed<00:05:09.389> quite<00:05:09.840> a<00:05:09.960> bit<00:05:10.110> of

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:10.199 
I remember needed quite a bit of

00:05:10.199 --> 00:05:12.050 
I remember needed quite a bit of
break-in<00:05:10.530> time<00:05:10.710> on<00:05:11.039> the<00:05:11.280> originals<00:05:11.699> and<00:05:11.880> then

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
break-in time on the originals and then

the way that you see them on online with
the<00:05:48.660> catalog<00:05:49.050> images<00:05:49.229> and<00:05:49.620> things<00:05:49.770> like<00:05:49.889> that

the catalog images and things like that
they're<00:05:50.340> not<00:05:50.370> quite<00:05:50.780> like<00:05:51.780> that<00:05:52.020> way<00:05:52.410> so<00:05:52.470> it's

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919 
they're not quite like that way so it's

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:55.100 
they're not quite like that way so it's
not<00:05:52.979> white<00:05:53.400> on<00:05:53.610> the<00:05:54.060> toe<00:05:54.240> like<00:05:54.539> it<00:05:54.690> looks<00:05:54.900> like

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
not white on the toe like it looks like

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:57.320 
not white on the toe like it looks like
it's<00:05:55.320> actually<00:05:55.440> a<00:05:55.680> purple<00:05:56.130> kind<00:05:56.849> of<00:05:56.910> gradient

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
it's actually a purple kind of gradient

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.050

fade<00:05:57.570> to<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.050> darker<00:05:58.349> blue<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.740> the<00:05:58.830> back<00:05:59.060> and

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.060 
fade to the darker blue in the back and

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:01.550 
fade to the darker blue in the back and
then<00:06:00.389> this<00:06:00.570> is<00:06:00.720> like<00:06:00.900> an<00:06:01.020> infra<00:06:01.260> red<00:06:01.349> color

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560

which i think looks great with these
colors<00:06:03.479> it<00:06:04.020> looks<00:06:04.229> a<00:06:04.320> little<00:06:04.410> funny<00:06:04.740> by<00:06:04.979> itself

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
colors it looks a little funny by itself

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
this whole rebranding process I've done

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.600 
this whole rebranding process I've done
it<00:06:21.810> before<00:06:21.930> because<00:06:22.320> my<00:06:22.620> website<00:06:23.160> originally

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
it before because my website originally

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:25.640 
it before because my website originally
used<00:06:23.760> to<00:06:23.849> be<00:06:23.940> called<00:06:24.120> Nightwing<00:06:24.479> to<00:06:24.630> 3:03<00:06:25.110> comm

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:27.710 
used to be called Nightwing to 3:03 comm
and<00:06:25.860> then<00:06:26.490> I<00:06:26.669> changed<00:06:26.970> it<00:06:27.060> to<00:06:27.090> kicks<00:06:27.330> on<00:06:27.449> court

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720 
and then I changed it to kicks on court

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.810 
and then I changed it to kicks on court
because<00:06:27.870> it<00:06:27.960> was<00:06:28.050> more<00:06:28.229> professional<00:06:28.820> and

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:29.820 
because it was more professional and

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:31.730
