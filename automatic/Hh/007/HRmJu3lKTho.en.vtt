00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:03.949
 8 

00:00:12.819 --> 00:00:15.819
 there is a day in it that he said sit there 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.919
 the owner exchanged 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:21.470
 really 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.739
 I scored after more than one 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:29.739
 the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.290
 a lot of attention 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.650
 could always take with dancing girls but why they cast his vote 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.930
 herb to taste is Groningen University researchers 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.290
 the guitar music and traditions pappano 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.900
 this newspaper 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.940
 how does it actually come in two steps 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.940
 6 I sat that 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.770
 this one 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.130
 9 he is 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
 that draws the data that wrong women 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.970
 interesting because people who move state often 2 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.210
 Research has also shown that 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.210
 women why 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.980
 this tradition is 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.030
 doctors give creativity 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.950
 people she can be 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
 it is all about music 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.569
 players are just the system in position 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.820
 tribute 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.670
 the attorney the person 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.820
 due to bad weather if something did not express itself statically 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 according to meijer of the women topless at bartender 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.390
 8 8 adha 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.190
 also complying with it I do not expect that made the team Brugge 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.069
 last year artist 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.179
 the 

00:02:11.179 --> 00:02:14.179
 6 Amsterdam 3 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:17.979
 pieces of signature 

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.430
 he already indicated the fat 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.769
 yes I think so this 6 I am a bit worse 

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:32.789
 I don't have the muscle mass or the 

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:39.029
 the sheep thus can choose to do so in a different way 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.189
 against ANP AK but that got it 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:54.400
 2 I have a network company that controls the mains 

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:58.729
 I have to be spent 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.449
 gosh 

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.449
 hjl 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.749
 he said 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.649
 a 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:38.729
 were in order 

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:41.729
 laura 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.489
 it was 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.309
 well 

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:53.370
 Yes really 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.949
 what is trackbacken 

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.959
 but no longer swing at her no matter how heavy 

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:02.209
 in a room 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:05.209
 I don't do that often 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:09.159
 I think the women catch up with their own 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:15.049
 actually i'm just saying my little sister on sheep 10 that this milestone 8 i'm going 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.049
 not about the self but the women who already think it is cda 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.739
 on an 8 or 9 I go for it 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:25.120
 that man and they calmly enter the competition and the other woman 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.120
 That means she has her twitter account 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.889
 what is trackbacken we know 

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:33.550
 the draw 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.039
 well yes nicky hayden leaves friday that were done 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:43.819
 going less well in a church with me is the one and the other I can comment 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.080
 it could be that the Palestinians have that 

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.210
 you get more attention if they do 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:57.990
 good 

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.610
 9 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.009
 7 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.610
 moreover of course also 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.400
 it's an important reason 

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:08.680
 the wezep working group 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.150
 there is a stage what is your opinion that 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:14.210
 ridiculous 4 

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.099
 X 

00:05:16.099 --> 00:05:19.159
 Two things to signal that in Hoogstraten has taken a moment at that time 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.179
 on such a terrible death it has the idea to give it the high street 

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.990
 But it is also someone who does this through creativity 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.720
 also from stratford smet my child we have more children there are also 

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.720
 got reaming nice 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:38.270
 I think so 

00:05:38.839 --> 00:05:40.749
 this will not be a few months
