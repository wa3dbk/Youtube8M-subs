00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.679
 and very good people here I bring you a 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.160
 new video this time is a tutorial 

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:23.960
 of how to copy emblems of butterfield 4 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.489
 and put them in our soldier first thing 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.739
 what we have to do is go to the link that 

00:00:25.489 --> 00:00:30.890
 is to the description that will take us to 

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:34.219
 this page this page will come out all 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.469
 emblems that I've made people choose 

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.020
 the one you like the most in my case is the 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:41.320
 level 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:45.190
 I give you a click and this will come out 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:48.030
 page from here and will open open and it will come out 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.980
 all this code 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 and we have to copy everything that is 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.140
 in the black box below all 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.920
 up to this point 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.010
 and give it right click and copy 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.949
 tlc 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:09.600
 and we go once we have already 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.310
 copied we go to our toilet what not 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.600
 will come out here and the soldier all that 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:18.390
 let's customize emblem and here 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.290
 all the emblems that we have will come out 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.900
 and we are going to add 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.150
 and it will set us up to make a new 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:31.070
 emblem and it 's there what we have to 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.980
 to do is to give ctl shift j in the case of 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.510
 google chrome in firefox is different from 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:38.240
 I will leave you anyway in the 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:41.740
 description so you can see how they are made 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:44.770
 all browsers 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.580
 and once we are here we give / 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.730
 lv 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.290
 and what we copied before will be copied 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:57.020
 will stick and we give to enter and already 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.980
 will begin to load emblem and see the 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:03.410
 Emblem is already loaded and rendered and 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:05.960
 you will have the emblem here in the 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.760
 our blog goes and simply they 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.690
 wait to use and you are already have the 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:14.540
 emblem 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:17.360
 if it takes a little while to load it 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.060
 but normally not much I saw that japan 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.730
 saved emblem and even to check 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:26.090
 that we were already our soldier and now 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.640
 will go out here with my soldier and with the 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.640
 emblem of the leader that is where I 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.980
 you usually check the bullets because 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:37.159
 the truth is running out very quickly 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.340
 and they are good for price and offer if 

00:02:37.159 --> 00:02:43.250
 so and good and if you liked the video
