project<00:02:15.520> into<00:02:15.790> their<00:02:15.940> outreach<00:02:16.330> program<00:02:16.810> the

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
project into their outreach program the

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.590 
project into their outreach program the
department<00:02:18.280> has<00:02:18.400> a<00:02:18.430> presence<00:02:18.850> in<00:02:18.970> every<00:02:19.090> rural

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
department has a presence in every rural

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.600 
department has a presence in every rural
parish<00:02:19.960> in<00:02:20.110> all<00:02:20.230> 112<00:02:20.980> districts<00:02:21.490> of<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
parish in all 112 districts of the

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.520 
parish in all 112 districts of the
country<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.240> therefore<00:02:22.960> has<00:02:23.080> the<00:02:23.110> potential

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
country and therefore has the potential

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.300 
country and therefore has the potential
to<00:02:23.830> scale<00:02:23.920> the<00:02:24.190> project<00:02:24.310> massively<00:02:26.040> we<00:02:27.040> felt

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
to scale the project massively we felt

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.300 
to scale the project massively we felt
that<00:02:27.430> if<00:02:28.270> we<00:02:28.330> cooperated<00:02:29.260> with<00:02:29.500> the<00:02:29.709> agreement

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
that if we cooperated with the agreement

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.380 
that if we cooperated with the agreement
which<00:02:31.060> were<00:02:31.420> really<00:02:31.720> underground<00:02:33.090> doing<00:02:34.090> that

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
which were really underground doing that

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.430 
which were really underground doing that
what<00:02:34.690> we<00:02:34.990> intend<00:02:35.290> to<00:02:35.350> do<00:02:35.560> we<00:02:36.430> fail<00:02:36.670> to<00:02:36.940> be

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
what we intend to do we fail to be

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.470 
what we intend to do we fail to be
jumping<00:02:38.440> one<00:02:38.950> step

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:48.160 

process<00:02:41.989> this<00:02:42.830> time<00:02:42.890> around<00:02:44.290> we<00:02:47.170> rejected

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
process this time around we rejected

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.000 
process this time around we rejected
buying<00:02:48.590> the<00:02:49.010> diesel<00:02:49.370> mobile<00:02:49.700> phones<00:02:50.030> and

from<00:03:04.760> gramineae<00:03:05.239> experience<00:03:07.239> they<00:03:08.379> are<00:03:09.379> going

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
from gramineae experience they are going

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.140 
from gramineae experience they are going
to<00:03:09.680> import<00:03:09.950> what<00:03:10.340> are<00:03:10.489> called<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:10.760> charging

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
to import what are called the charging

solutions<00:03:15.730> this<00:03:16.730> is<00:03:16.970> a<00:03:17.000> machine<00:03:18.910> always<00:03:20.200> it<00:03:21.200> is

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
solutions this is a machine always it is

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.349 
solutions this is a machine always it is
used<00:03:21.709> in<00:03:22.099> an<00:03:22.280> area<00:03:22.609> where<00:03:22.849> there<00:03:23.060> is<00:03:23.180> no

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:23.359 
used in an area where there is no

00:03:23.359 --> 00:03:26.199 
used in an area where there is no
electricity<00:03:23.510> every<00:03:24.200> time<00:03:24.379> so<00:03:25.370> sometimes<00:03:26.000> when

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
electricity every time so sometimes when

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.720 
electricity every time so sometimes when
the<00:03:26.329> power<00:03:26.540> gets<00:03:26.750> off<00:03:26.989> we<00:03:27.620> can<00:03:27.799> use<00:03:27.980> bicycle<00:03:28.579> to

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:28.730 
the power gets off we can use bicycle to

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.130 
the power gets off we can use bicycle to
charge<00:03:28.970> it<00:03:29.530> so<00:03:30.530> yeah<00:03:31.459> you<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.450> hear<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.900> sound

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
charge it so yeah you can hear the sound

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.199 
charge it so yeah you can hear the sound
our<00:03:33.290> teeth<00:03:33.560> that<00:03:34.010> it<00:03:34.129> means<00:03:34.340> it<00:03:34.700> has<00:03:34.879> started

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
our teeth that it means it has started

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:41.619 
our teeth that it means it has started
charging<00:03:36.010> yeah

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:41.629 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:44.440 

when<00:03:42.230> when<00:03:42.439> I<00:03:42.469> cycle<00:03:42.920> for<00:03:43.069> two<00:03:43.159> hours<00:03:43.640> ah<00:03:43.670> that

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
when when I cycle for two hours ah that

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.470 
when when I cycle for two hours ah that
is<00:03:44.599> roughly<00:03:44.959> let<00:03:45.439> me<00:03:45.620> see<00:03:46.060> it's<00:03:47.060> roughly<00:03:47.329> about

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:47.480 
is roughly let me see it's roughly about

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.110 
is roughly let me see it's roughly about
20<00:03:47.930> kilometers<00:03:49.090> for<00:03:50.090> two<00:03:50.180> hours<00:03:50.480> yes<00:03:52.090> guys

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
20 kilometers for two hours yes guys

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.799 
20 kilometers for two hours yes guys
buta<00:03:53.569> exercise<00:03:53.989> so<00:03:54.560> good
