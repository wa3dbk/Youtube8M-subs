00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.480 
i can and then any enter when I do this

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.870 
i can and then any enter when I do this
I<00:02:00.720> can<00:02:00.870> find<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.260> which<00:02:01.710> rooms<00:02:02.100> are<00:02:02.370> actually

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:08.030 
then and then whatever is left has to be

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:10.279
