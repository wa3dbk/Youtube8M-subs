like the upright arching habit of this

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.110 
like the upright arching habit of this
shrub<00:00:12.330> what's<00:00:13.230> nice<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.830> is<00:00:14.130> maintenance

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
shrub what's nice is is maintenance

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.540 
shrub what's nice is is maintenance
person<00:00:15.809> in<00:00:15.960> this<00:00:16.170> area<00:00:16.529> has<00:00:16.740> left<00:00:17.010> this<00:00:17.220> thing

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
person in this area has left this thing

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.300 
person in this area has left this thing
to<00:00:17.760> grow<00:00:18.000> the<00:00:18.210> way<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.510> normally<00:00:18.990> does<00:00:19.260> and<00:00:19.590> a

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
to grow the way it normally does and a

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.310 
to grow the way it normally does and a
lot<00:00:20.490> of<00:00:20.640> times<00:00:20.880> you<00:00:21.150> see<00:00:21.359> this<00:00:21.539> pruned<00:00:21.930> into

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
lot of times you see this pruned into

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.370 
lot of times you see this pruned into
balls<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.130> especially<00:00:24.060> in<00:00:24.449> commercial

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
balls and especially in commercial

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.220 
balls and especially in commercial
applications<00:00:26.340> so<00:00:26.699> this<00:00:27.300> shows<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.840> a<00:00:27.869> good

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
applications so this shows you a good

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.040 
applications so this shows you a good
good<00:00:29.010> look<00:00:29.279> at<00:00:29.519> what<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.970> plant<00:00:30.330> naturally

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
good look at what this plant naturally

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.560 
good look at what this plant naturally
does<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.949> can<00:00:32.130> see<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.489> branches<00:00:33.030> at<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.239> top

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
does you can see the branches at the top

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.549 
does you can see the branches at the top
how<00:00:34.440> they<00:00:34.649> arch<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.390> kind<00:00:36.390> of<00:00:36.510> poke<00:00:36.719> out<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:37.260> I

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
how they arch and kind of poke out and I

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.040 
how they arch and kind of poke out and I
just<00:00:38.250> like<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.520> look<00:00:39.000> about<00:00:39.210> it<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.840> how

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
just like that look about it you see how

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.650 
just like that look about it you see how
on<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> sides<00:00:40.680> here<00:00:41.160> these<00:00:41.760> branches<00:00:42.420> weep

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
on the sides here these branches weep

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.889 
on the sides here these branches weep
down<00:00:42.989> so<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.399> graceful<00:00:44.969> feel<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
down so I like the graceful feel of the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.580 
down so I like the graceful feel of the
plant<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.460> Edward<00:00:47.460> Goucher<00:00:48.030> has<00:00:48.930> these<00:00:49.200> pink

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
plant and Edward Goucher has these pink

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.450 
plant and Edward Goucher has these pink
flowers<00:00:50.190> this<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.520> late<00:00:51.120> August<00:00:51.750> and<00:00:52.190> all<00:00:53.190> the

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
flowers this is late August and all the

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.119 
flowers this is late August and all the
abelian<00:00:53.850> I'm<00:00:54.239> looking<00:00:54.660> at<00:00:54.870> are<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.440> full<00:00:55.800> bloom

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
abelian I'm looking at are in full bloom

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.049 
abelian I'm looking at are in full bloom
right<00:00:56.190> now<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:57.000> this<00:00:57.960> is<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.199> best<00:00:58.530> looking

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
right now and this is the best looking

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.180 
right now and this is the best looking
type<00:01:00.059> of<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.359> bee<00:01:00.539> Lea<00:01:00.809> I've<00:01:00.989> looked<00:01:01.620> at<00:01:01.890> in

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
type of a bee Lea I've looked at in

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.109 
type of a bee Lea I've looked at in
terms<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.969> flowers<00:01:03.539> in<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:04.260> the

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
terms of flowers in just the

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:08.870 
terms of flowers in just the
proliferation<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.799> flowers<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:07.850> really<00:01:08.850> a

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
proliferation of flowers so really a

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.420 
proliferation of flowers so really a
nice<00:01:09.150> show<00:01:09.500> especially<00:01:10.500> in<00:01:10.619> late<00:01:10.799> summer<00:01:11.159> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
nice show especially in late summer you

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
nice show especially in late summer you
know<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.000> lot<00:01:12.240> of<00:01:12.270> shrubs<00:01:12.720> that

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
know there's not a lot of shrubs that

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.219 
know there's not a lot of shrubs that
put<00:01:13.619> on<00:01:13.740> this<00:01:13.950> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.430> show<00:01:14.700> at<00:01:15.450> this<00:01:15.720> time<00:01:16.049> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
put on this kind of show at this time of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.570 
put on this kind of show at this time of
year<00:01:16.560> so<00:01:17.090> that's<00:01:18.090> one<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> benefits

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
year so that's one of the benefits

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.969 
year so that's one of the benefits
spacing<00:01:20.580> this<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.180> about<00:01:21.479> an<00:01:22.380> 8<00:01:22.619> foot<00:01:22.920> wide

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
spacing this is about an 8 foot wide

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.340 
spacing this is about an 8 foot wide
shrub<00:01:23.670> by<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.890> 7<00:01:25.890> feet<00:01:26.220> tall<00:01:26.549> or<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:27.540> it's

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
shrub by about 7 feet tall or so so it's

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.520 
shrub by about 7 feet tall or so so it's
bigger<00:01:29.280> than<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.610> would<00:01:29.909> like<00:01:29.939> but<00:01:30.500> in<00:01:31.500> the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
bigger than I would like but in the

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.870 
bigger than I would like but in the
right<00:01:31.799> space<00:01:32.189> that's<00:01:32.939> fine<00:01:33.479> also<00:01:34.790> it's<00:01:35.790> very

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
right space that's fine also it's very

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.270 
right space that's fine also it's very
shapeable<00:01:36.689> because<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.439> its<00:01:37.590> tiny<00:01:37.979> it's

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
shapeable because of its tiny it's

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.420 
shapeable because of its tiny it's
smaller<00:01:38.700> foliage<00:01:39.329> you<00:01:39.600> can<00:01:40.259> shape<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:41.040> and

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
smaller foliage you can shape this and

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.539 
smaller foliage you can shape this and
and<00:01:42.210> most<00:01:42.509> maintenance<00:01:43.290> guys<00:01:43.530> do<00:01:43.890> shape<00:01:44.189> it<00:01:44.399> by

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and most maintenance guys do shape it by

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.280 
and most maintenance guys do shape it by
the<00:01:44.610> way<00:01:44.850> so<00:01:44.909> if<00:01:45.570> you're<00:01:45.689> going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:45.930> use<00:01:46.140> this

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
the way so if you're going to use this

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.440 
the way so if you're going to use this
in<00:01:46.500> your<00:01:46.530> garden<00:01:47.070> give<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.460> some<00:01:47.670> space<00:01:47.850> so<00:01:48.299> it

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
in your garden give it some space so it

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.630 
in your garden give it some space so it
can<00:01:48.630> look<00:01:48.840> natural<00:01:49.380> the<00:01:49.530> way<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.710> see<00:01:50.040> here<00:01:50.490> or

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
can look natural the way you see here or

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.940 
can look natural the way you see here or
if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.479> want<00:01:51.720> a<00:01:51.810> little<00:01:52.020> more<00:01:52.110> refined<00:01:52.680> look

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:52.950 
if you want a little more refined look

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.789 
if you want a little more refined look
it'll<00:01:53.189> certainly<00:01:53.490> handle<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.680> but<00:01:55.680> if

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
it'll certainly handle that but if

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.330 
it'll certainly handle that but if
you're<00:01:55.920> gonna<00:01:56.040> do<00:01:56.340> a<00:01:56.369> grouping<00:01:56.939> they<00:01:57.240> plant<00:01:57.600> it

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
you're gonna do a grouping they plant it

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:02.929 
you're gonna do a grouping they plant it
most<00:01:59.340> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> abuses<00:02:00.270> are<00:02:01.310> fairly<00:02:02.310> deer

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
most of the abuses are fairly deer

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.539 
most of the abuses are fairly deer
resistant<00:02:03.570> by<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.780> way<00:02:04.079> so<00:02:04.140> if<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.520> a

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
resistant by the way so if you have a

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.210 
resistant by the way so if you have a
deer<00:02:05.909> situation<00:02:06.780> I<00:02:06.990> would<00:02:07.619> definitely<00:02:08.039> give

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
deer situation I would definitely give

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.190 
deer situation I would definitely give
this<00:02:08.369> one<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> try<00:02:09.000> I've<00:02:09.300> had<00:02:09.509> pretty<00:02:09.720> good<00:02:09.869> luck

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
this one a try I've had pretty good luck

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.610 
this one a try I've had pretty good luck
with<00:02:10.229> the<00:02:10.560> bee<00:02:10.800> Lea's<00:02:11.039> in<00:02:11.069> deer<00:02:11.700> areas<00:02:12.379> there

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
with the bee Lea's in deer areas there

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.190 
with the bee Lea's in deer areas there
poisonous<00:02:14.310> so<00:02:14.750> they're<00:02:15.750> not<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.930> hundred

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
poisonous so they're not a hundred

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.660 
poisonous so they're not a hundred
percent<00:02:16.379> but<00:02:17.099> certainly<00:02:17.819> worth<00:02:18.030> a<00:02:18.180> try<00:02:19.670> and

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
percent but certainly worth a try and

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.850 
percent but certainly worth a try and
they're<00:02:21.120> very<00:02:21.330> drought<00:02:21.750> resistant<00:02:22.410> actually

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
they're very drought resistant actually

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
they're very drought resistant actually
I<00:02:22.890> shouldn't<00:02:23.730> say<00:02:23.790> very<00:02:24.239> but<00:02:24.510> they're

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
I shouldn't say very but they're

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.570 
I shouldn't say very but they're
certainly<00:02:24.870> drought<00:02:25.379> resistant<00:02:26.010> I've<00:02:26.190> seen

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
certainly drought resistant I've seen

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.170 
certainly drought resistant I've seen
this<00:02:27.390> plant<00:02:28.170> left<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:29.040> median<00:02:29.610> islands<00:02:30.090> they

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
this plant left and median islands they

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.830 
this plant left and median islands they
got<00:02:30.360> little<00:02:30.660> or<00:02:30.840> no<00:02:31.140> seasonal<00:02:31.799> water<00:02:32.069> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
got little or no seasonal water and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.570 
got little or no seasonal water and
we're<00:02:33.840> just<00:02:34.049> they<00:02:34.500> didn't<00:02:34.830> they<00:02:35.220> don't<00:02:35.400> look

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
we're just they didn't they don't look

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.670 
we're just they didn't they don't look
quite<00:02:35.970> as<00:02:36.150> good<00:02:36.239> but<00:02:36.660> they<00:02:36.870> were<00:02:36.900> handling<00:02:37.530> it

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
quite as good but they were handling it

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.009 
quite as good but they were handling it
so<00:02:37.830> you<00:02:38.040> can<00:02:38.489> certainly<00:02:38.700> establish<00:02:39.540> these<00:02:39.750> on

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
so you can certainly establish these on

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.740 
so you can certainly establish these on
drip<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> cut<00:02:41.430> them<00:02:41.640> way<00:02:41.849> back<00:02:42.180> as<00:02:42.510> they

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
drip and cut them way back as they

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.660 
drip and cut them way back as they
mature<00:02:43.200> and<00:02:43.500> they<00:02:43.590> seem<00:02:43.830> to<00:02:43.980> handle<00:02:44.160> that<00:02:44.430> okay

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
mature and they seem to handle that okay

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.240 
mature and they seem to handle that okay
I'm<00:02:45.150> in<00:02:45.299> a<00:02:45.330> hot<00:02:45.599> inland<00:02:46.079> Valley<00:02:46.319> and<00:02:46.680> they

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
I'm in a hot inland Valley and they

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.150 
I'm in a hot inland Valley and they
handle<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.760> situation<00:02:48.000> just<00:02:48.750> fine

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
handle that situation just fine

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.670 
handle that situation just fine
so<00:02:50.519> that's<00:02:50.730> Abilio<00:02:51.239> edward<00:02:51.630> Goucher<00:02:52.110> nice

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
so that's Abilio edward Goucher nice

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.360 
so that's Abilio edward Goucher nice
evergreen<00:02:53.370> shrub<00:02:54.650> hardiness<00:02:55.650> by<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> way<00:02:56.340> I

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
evergreen shrub hardiness by the way I

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.809 
evergreen shrub hardiness by the way I
think<00:02:57.150> these<00:02:57.360> are<00:02:57.630> Hardy<00:02:58.140> down<00:02:58.440> to<00:02:58.829> around<00:02:59.099> 20

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
think these are Hardy down to around 20

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:03.670 
think these are Hardy down to around 20
degrees<00:03:00.000> or<00:03:00.599> less<00:03:00.989> so<00:03:01.709> fairly<00:03:02.280> Hardy<00:03:02.879> plant

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
degrees or less so fairly Hardy plant

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.550 
degrees or less so fairly Hardy plant
the<00:03:04.680> different<00:03:05.069> varieties<00:03:05.610> might<00:03:05.910> be<00:03:06.560> might

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
the different varieties might be might

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.440 
the different varieties might be might
have<00:03:07.769> a<00:03:07.799> different<00:03:08.220> tolerance<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.879> cold<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.420> I

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
have a different tolerance to cold but I

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.150 
have a different tolerance to cold but I
believe<00:03:09.959> that's<00:03:10.200> about<00:03:10.530> where<00:03:10.799> they're<00:03:11.069> gonna

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
believe that's about where they're gonna

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:14.000 
believe that's about where they're gonna
they're<00:03:11.970> gonna<00:03:12.120> be<00:03:12.720> tolerant<00:03:13.230> to<00:03:13.440> is<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.829> low

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
they're gonna be tolerant to is the low

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.579 
they're gonna be tolerant to is the low
20s
