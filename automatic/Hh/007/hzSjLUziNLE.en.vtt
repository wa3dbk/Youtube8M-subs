00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
zombie application for the iphone ipod

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.650 
zombie application for the iphone ipod
touch<00:00:10.620> and<00:00:11.099> i<00:00:11.460> don't<00:00:11.969> think<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.420> available

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
touch and i don't think it's available

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.600 
touch and i don't think it's available
to<00:00:12.870> the<00:00:12.929> ipad<00:00:13.320> quite<00:00:13.650> yet<00:00:13.950> but<00:00:14.130> it<00:00:14.280> probably

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:14.610 
to the ipad quite yet but it probably

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.939 
to the ipad quite yet but it probably
will<00:00:14.880> be<00:00:15.059> in<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> near<00:00:15.389> future<00:00:15.480> so<00:00:16.109> in<00:00:16.800> this

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
will be in the near future so in this

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.580 
will be in the near future so in this
case<00:00:17.160> it<00:00:17.369> is<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.490> free<00:00:17.850> game<00:00:18.090> newly<00:00:18.900> released<00:00:18.930> to

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
case it is a free game newly released to

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.740 
case it is a free game newly released to
the<00:00:19.710> App<00:00:19.859> Store<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:20.520> really<00:00:21.090> like<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.660> know

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
the App Store I really like it you know

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.679 
the App Store I really like it you know
it<00:00:21.930> has<00:00:22.080> some<00:00:22.320> loading<00:00:22.590> issues<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.689> people

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
it has some loading issues and people

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.859 
it has some loading issues and people
wrote<00:00:24.869> it<00:00:25.019> rate<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.650> like<00:00:26.010> three<00:00:26.400> stars<00:00:26.869> do

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
wrote it rate it like three stars do

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.839 
wrote it rate it like three stars do
probably<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> fact<00:00:28.769> that<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.160> takes<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.490> long

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
probably the fact that it takes so long

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.420 
probably the fact that it takes so long
to<00:00:29.910> load<00:00:30.300> but<00:00:31.140> once<00:00:31.349> it<00:00:31.500> is<00:00:31.529> loaded<00:00:31.920> it's<00:00:32.340> a

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
to load but once it is loaded it's a

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.180 
to load but once it is loaded it's a
pretty<00:00:32.610> good<00:00:32.790> game<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.930> know<00:00:34.079> it's<00:00:35.040> one

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
pretty good game and you know it's one

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.680 
pretty good game and you know it's one
of<00:00:35.219> those<00:00:35.340> games<00:00:35.550> that<00:00:35.760> I'll<00:00:36.000> probably<00:00:36.180> play

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
of those games that I'll probably play

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.080 
of those games that I'll probably play
for<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> while<00:00:37.140> not<00:00:38.129> forever<00:00:38.340> but<00:00:38.579> for<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> while

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
for a while not forever but for a while

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.580 
for a while not forever but for a while
I<00:00:39.149> just<00:00:39.600> thought<00:00:39.719> it<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:39.899> worthy<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.260> me<00:00:40.500> to

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
I just thought it was worthy of me to

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.660 
I just thought it was worthy of me to
show<00:00:40.800> you<00:00:40.860> it<00:00:44.780> alright<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.050> once<00:00:46.920> you<00:00:47.160> get<00:00:47.489> an

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
show you it alright so once you get an

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.119 
show you it alright so once you get an
application<00:00:47.850> will<00:00:48.360> load<00:00:48.600> up<00:00:48.629> for<00:00:49.110> a<00:00:49.770> while<00:00:49.860> and

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
application will load up for a while and

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.200 
application will load up for a while and
i'll<00:00:50.250> go<00:00:50.399> ahead<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.640> connect<00:00:51.000> and

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
i'll go ahead and connect and

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.170 
i'll go ahead and connect and
synchronize<00:00:51.660> and<00:00:51.690> load<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.760> it's<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> longer

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
synchronize and load and it's a longer

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.060 
synchronize and load and it's a longer
process<00:00:54.360> that<00:00:54.840> i<00:00:54.870> already<00:00:55.020> skipped<00:00:55.500> over<00:00:55.649> so

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
process that i already skipped over so

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.260 
process that i already skipped over so
you<00:00:56.160> guys<00:00:56.280> didn't<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.670> to<00:00:56.730> wait<00:00:56.940> all<00:00:57.120> the

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
you guys didn't have to wait all the

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.029 
you guys didn't have to wait all the
time<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.570> takes<00:00:57.719> about<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.800> get<00:00:58.980> an

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
time it takes about you first get an

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.150 
time it takes about you first get an
application<00:00:59.309> will<00:00:59.760> take<00:00:59.940> about<00:01:00.030> I'd<00:01:00.449> say

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
application will take about I'd say

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.650 
application will take about I'd say
three<00:01:02.160> minutes<00:01:02.579> actually<00:01:02.789> probably<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.480> load

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
three minutes actually probably to load

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.420 
three minutes actually probably to load
it<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.110> time<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.619> then<00:01:05.010> all<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.309> other

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
it the first time and then all the other

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.310 
it the first time and then all the other
times<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:05.970> gets<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.150> little<00:01:06.240> bit<00:01:06.450> faster<00:01:06.630> but

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
times it gets a little bit faster but

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.870 
times it gets a little bit faster but
once<00:01:07.470> you're<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.710> application<00:01:08.220> itself<00:01:08.549> as<00:01:08.760> you

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
once you're an application itself as you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.480 
once you're an application itself as you
guys<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.210> see<00:01:09.270> it'll<00:01:09.540> connect<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.930> my<00:01:10.490> game

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
guys can see it'll connect to my game

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
guys can see it'll connect to my game
