00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.040

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:17.109

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:21.220
 paris is finally we spend iphone 6 a 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:22.869
 typical box of the time as you can see no 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.220
 had already complied and thanked everyone 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:30.070
 those who accompanied what I think 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:33.250
 on facebook I'm the version that I am 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:36.790
 reserve for the survey was the 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.570
 64GB version of both iphone quit 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:44.020
 same website so 4.7 inches is in 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:46.830
 silva passing pitch silvery and white in the 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.830
 front panel 

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.930
 now what matters for sure are 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.210
 as anxious as I am 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.800
 This is the first boxing we 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.750
 This is not too bad in the 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.390
 comments in mexico 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.239
 Let's start getting this machine 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.549
 here with all the care that 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.039
 exists so as not to ruin the carton 

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.219
 This is because I like to keep 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:11.219
 boxes 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.539
 come on take out the typical plastic size 

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:26.740
 this device 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.109
 and now the finally after so much 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.390
 hopes to make us understand a little 

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:35.680
 Let's just let the box slip. 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:38.869
 a little bit more 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:43.790
 now it's okay, we're not going to have the same 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:48.070
 is style is for blank index 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:52.580
 the right choice i think i chose well 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:54.380
 mine is so fine fact so thin in relation 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.690
 to the previous model that is not easy 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.659
 take it out of the box we can not 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:03.670
 collateral of the box is are they are the 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:09.470
 first kiosk boxing images 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:12.620

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.010
 side already in the back I planned box brings 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:20.170
 more the same things always so the 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.450
 instructions is very quick and tiny 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:31.700
 iphone do both normal documentation 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:34.190
 the box and then the three accessories that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.110
 everyone is already familiar with the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:41.090
 chain 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:43.489
 the usb cable that despite the goals like 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:46.190
 can see is not possible is a cable 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:51.470
 normal and five as well as 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:03:04.430
 suspected and the phones were already 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:03:06.709
 they know the iphone is r 5 and can more 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:11.329
 since there is the iphone 6 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:14.260
 it's very easy to judge has fits 

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:20.030
 very good in very fine hand 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:24.890
 as you can see is yet to make a 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:28.130
 full year boxing full of plastic 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.989
 hahaha a small comparison like the 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:40.489
 Current cases both 55 4 inches 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:43.220
 will have to make a full 6 64 gigs 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:47.239
 cell phone fun 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:49.950
 the white front panel 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.019
 they have all the accessories wedge in the 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.690
 sound box and I said thank you for 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.370
 watch and this first unboxing of 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.349
 kiosk 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.769
 If you liked these videos, it was the 

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:05.250
 first sorry for the lack of 

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:07.890
 practice that has also been very 

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:10.379
 anxious and therefore we will also be given 

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:13.440
 heard from the video of chen is one that 

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:15.569
 helped me a lot of inventories on the 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:18.449
 that they found what they think size 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.370
 I think they can subscribe to the 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.609
 Channel spoke of the floor which I think the 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.609
 Apple
