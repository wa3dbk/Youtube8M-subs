you're removing that one that has the

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.370 
you're removing that one that has the

front io built into it because obviously

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.619 
front io built into it because obviously
it<00:02:07.860> has<00:02:08.009> some<00:02:08.250> wires<00:02:08.550> attached<00:02:08.970> to<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.270> so

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
it has some wires attached to it so

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:10.639 
it has some wires attached to it so
we're<00:02:09.720> going<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.899> pull<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> windowed

we're going to pull off the windowed

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.190 
we're going to pull off the windowed
