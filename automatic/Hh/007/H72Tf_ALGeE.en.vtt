 something that I know you're going to like a lot 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.239
 because because we already reached the end of 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.460
 week I know that many like it 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:29.219
 eat something sweet that if the dessert cited 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.739
 that if consenting the groom will consent 

00:00:29.219 --> 00:00:33.420
 to the bride to the family then what 

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:35.820
 better than with a dessert that is rich 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.559
 easy that you occupy few ingredients that 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 do not take any time so why 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.150
 that the day of where I bring one but two 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.610
 delicious desserts with the rich and 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.290
 famous oreo cookies and the first is a 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.170
 oreo cheesecake that will not take you 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.120
 or seven minutes do not occupy oven 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.030
 you occupy three ingredients really is 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.250
 super easy to do and it's very rich and the 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.350
 second option are some popcorn oreos 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.329
 and all of these sweet popcorn 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.579
 are going to love you are not going to occupy either 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.890
 five minutes making them occupy three 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.140
 ingredients is super rich is super 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.670
 easy so if you want to pamper 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.310
 this weekend with something sweet 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.380
 stay watching this video and for the 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.689
 first post we have a cheesecake 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.939
 and you can not imagine how easy it is 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.619
 of doing it will take us five 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.360
 minutes prepare it and for who 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.670
 try it does not look marginal that is a 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.750
 dessert so easy so we 're going to 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.880
 need 16 cookies oreo 8 ounces of 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.369
 cream cheese 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.890
 and condensed milk here there is no 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.780
 exact amount since we 're going to use the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:38.430
 amount you want depending on the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.420
 sweet that you want I use more or 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.580
 minus a little less than half a can 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.670
 and for the first step what we will do is 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.409
 put our cookies in a bag and 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.570
 we are going to try to crush them with something 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.850
 that you have on hand it is important that 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.009
 leave some considerable pieces since 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.580
 we do not want it to be very dusty 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.580
 result 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.050
 that we have our cookies 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.120
 crushed what we will do is put the 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.030
 half of these cookies in a bowl 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.619
 or where you plan to put them in this case 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.870
 I'm going to use this mason jr which is 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.000
 small but you can use what 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.070
 you want and the stuffing has no idea what 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.960
 simple it is just going to 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.870
 put the cream cheese in a bowl and 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.640
 we are going to add condensed milk 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.080
 remember that this is optional as it goes 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.080
 to be as sweet as you want 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.340
 let's beat the two very well 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.920
 ingredients until there are no lumps 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.350
 and there is a consistency of heavy cream 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.870
 and we will add four cookies that 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.330
 it would be half of the cookies 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.280
 crushed that we already stayed so 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.560
 we are going to stir very well if you want 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.400
 add a little more or a little less is 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.400
 totally to your liking 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.600
 let's put the amount of fill that 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:06.760
 you want in the container where already 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:08.590
 we've put the cookie base and we're going 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.560
 to decorate with the other four cookies 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.480
 that we had left so this is super 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.180
 simple I would recommend you what 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.030
 Refrigerate about 30 minutes because cold 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.620
 It tastes much richer but it's your choice 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.620
 and it tastes delicious 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.129
 the idea is some popcorn oreo that to you 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.439
 you like sweet popcorn this idea 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:54.939
 it's perfect for you so let's go 

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:58.549
 need first of all imagine 

00:03:54.939 --> 00:04:01.340
 two and a half cups of natural popcorn 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.599
 and six ounces of white chocolate and in 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:06.469
 this time I will use this 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:08.930
 chocolate that is christmas edition that is 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.120
 cookies in cream but you can use 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.280
 chocolate just white or whatever if 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.379
 you want and good the first thing that you have to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.130
 to do is put your chocolate in a 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:21.440
 container and after that we're going to 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.199
 put our cookies oreo in a 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.370
 plastic bag and the shredded 

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:28.190
 same way as in the cheesecake 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:34.639
 we want something that are bits but not 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:36.710
 dust since we have it let's warm up 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:38.840
 our chocolate 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:41.120
 we are going to put it for periods of 30 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:45.009
 seconds in the microwave and you're going to 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.009
 checking until there is liquid 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.819
 since the chocolate is melted like 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.910
 final step what we will do is put in a 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:56.979
 extended container our popcorn 

00:04:54.910 --> 00:05:00.130
 to add all the popcorn 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:02.380
 chocolate and finish with the cookie 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.449
 oreo we are going to stir so that 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.440
 combine a bit all this we will leave 

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:09.580
