00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.170
 speaks welcome personal beauty but 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.480
 brazil game to talk to you and rafa 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.859
 9th I'll show you two new ones that 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.000
 are available here on pv 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.890
 so if you enjoy working 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.320
 I liked it more because it goes 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:23.670
 really help a lot of the channel is so 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.439
 the first cycle I will go 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.080
 show to you is the champion ramadinha 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.150
 the schin is called the back zimet hayman 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.579
 something probably translated 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.530
 to hayward that hazardous materials 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.480
 and precisely with more or less that name 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.700
 already says the champion's appearance 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.290
 really reminiscent of the images that 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.149
 we really associate with those 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.040
 people who work with materials 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 highly toxic at last he has this 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.930
 new thematic for the first time we do not 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.480
 we have that giant head exposed in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.460
 if a dress is all special but the 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.440
 top of the radius head once 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.090
 when it opens and you can 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.789
 fact remains with your videos 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.710
 golden hair but at last go managers 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.899
 their towers were changed 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.519
 missiles and also its bomb both in the 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.080
 normal skills when 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.210
 your skills while you are 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.280
 then we will have changes in your 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.470
 visual on your most normal days 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.689
 and in those more results I did not realize 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.490
 a change in their interactions that 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.600
 also in the sound of their spells 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.850
 It is also worth remembering that your animation 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 has been changed is what it is 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.360
 conventionally but at last I thought that 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.640
 It looks very beautiful, I'm fine. 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.619
 was very different despite the fact that 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.689
 I do not particularly think that the 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.570
 champion needs another corner 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.759
 but at least at last it was mouth and 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.350
 she is doing here in tb the value of 975 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:38.850
 right bridges 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.650
 the champion's second tip today 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.689
 Vladimir'm calling style is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.520
 probably Portuguese something related 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.110
 with a thief of souls 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.030
 I even thought that skiing was 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.189
 little strange that even I found it 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.340
 that was a skin of some champion of the 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.439
 game and not champion vladimir the vampire 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.570
 damn shame, I thought I ran away 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.189
 enough of the champion theme but I 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.840
 liked over here I thought it was well 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.600
 beautiful including all your 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.640
 particles of their spells were also 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.259
 changed since its just that until 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.000
 lately it is clear from your 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.800
 look that there was not 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.690
 reference of colors also of the champion 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.520
 trash that would be the reaper of souls 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.290
 dear league then champion the blog 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:19.510
 also brought a little this theme of 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.220
 corn right of his spells were 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.480
 well cool, I really liked the 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.270
 new animations 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.160
 the audio of the spells for now seems 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.740
 that will be changed because while 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.020
 I was testing here I got the sound not 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.300
 Imagine then that means maybe 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.370
 they change the audio 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.890
 but their interactions as a dance 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.020
 provocation and so on will remain the 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.000
 the same so far and your 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.310
 return animation as well as champion 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.170
 raimi was also altered. 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.420
 Well cool, I really appreciate you letting the 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.340
 champion was as masculine as he 

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.460
 could have stayed it's costing 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.260
 1,359 bridges worth as much as 

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.270
 because a tall one but if you see it well 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.560
 they ended up working hard on 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.150
 sic I liked it 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:03.580
 It's very cool, I think you'll go. 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:05.470
 earned your r track person basically 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.240
 I wanted to show you that I liked it. 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.740
 enough of the streets 15 I think they 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.810
 they did not look like their 20 points 

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.700
 they could also of course perfect 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.190
 skis to other champions who do not have 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.720
 I dodged beyond the 15 releases, right? 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.400
 but we also have to recognize that 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.950
 they look really cool 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.510
 I just hope you like it. 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.220
 comments that you thought you were inspired 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:25.630
 also from the video any other news 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.860
 I'll bring it to you in another video 

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.780
 do not worry about it 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.820
 remembering that we're on TV so before 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.830
 to forget officially launched 

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:33.280
 we may have some changes to the 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.810
 guys 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.980
 That's when you leave yours I liked because 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.200
 this will really help a lot 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.000
 favorite also comments that you found 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.430
 sign up if you have not written yet 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.180

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.180
