00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
like that and it's not very good for a

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:04.410 
like that and it's not very good for a
combat<00:03:03.519> so<00:03:03.760> I'm<00:03:03.850> going<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.030> go<00:03:04.120> ahead<00:03:04.209> and

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
that direction just like that then

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.020 
that direction just like that then
you're<00:04:20.549> gonna<00:04:20.640> pivot<00:04:21.440> like<00:04:22.440> this<00:04:22.740> and<00:04:23.580> go<00:04:23.850> the

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
left or the right this knee will shift

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:32.690 
left or the right this knee will shift
down<00:04:27.630> these<00:04:28.500> hands<00:04:28.920> go<00:04:29.190> down<00:04:31.400> coming<00:04:32.400> up<00:04:32.490> just

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
down these hands go down coming up just

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.880 
down these hands go down coming up just
like<00:04:32.910> that<00:04:32.970> so<00:04:33.750> work<00:04:33.990> on<00:04:34.170> that<00:04:34.440> in<00:04:34.680> both

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:34.890 
like that so work on that in both

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.860 
like that so work on that in both
directions<00:04:35.340> putting<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.330> hands<00:04:36.570> down
