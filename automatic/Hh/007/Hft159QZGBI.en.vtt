00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:10.710
 Well that conditioning 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.340
 I was asked to see this 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.100
 That after all that I own say in Ta' digested 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.450
 Only in the basket 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:23.010
 I do not think that I got better at all, but rather this conditioning 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.300
 Say 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:30.250
 By that 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.890
 The ability was I inscription punch in or was that his trust capacity 

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.290
 By evokes 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:42.100
 I think that I was able to demonstrate my ability, but that's also my body's bond 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:47.350
 The part that I am not aware of 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 After all that the trainer sees and corrects the correct line 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:57.559
 It is said that it is coming into the season to have a profitable program 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.329
 During that time, I myself myself that such things other than the basket are so important 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.720
 Because I felt great 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.860
 This is still in such part 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.540
 From now on 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:12.230
 On which everyone is doing to training 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.620
 I say that maybe basketball is important too 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.260
 I have a feeling 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.740
 I put it this time 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:22.080
 If you go to the end, you will definitely not be selfish 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:26.610
 Nde is not Oikome absolutely alone the Tteyuu training 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:28.020
 After all Ya ask still look to someone to find a partner or trainer's 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.740
 It is said that 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:36.450
 After all I think that it is the point where quality improves 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.000
 It may be good to do a few things, but after all this kind of conditioning 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.550
 One one carefully 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.950
 In search of quality 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.310
 I think I want to do 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:51.190
 Some of the great things I introduced this time 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:53.300
 It is a small part of the training I usually go through 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.560
 Doing that this way 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.940
 Being lucky three times a week and getting lucky 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.659
 Depending on how much I can do my best 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:09.789
 With the probability of fur 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.740
 I think that the ability or performance improvement will be sound when it comes to decision 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:15.890
 In 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.569
 The say the training of this off-season is important for me the most now 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.450
 After all everyone 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:26.290
 Well let's go to my own 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:28.830
 Doing their own in continuing ask them to keep up with change 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.670
 Please feel it 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.670
 Ah ah ah
