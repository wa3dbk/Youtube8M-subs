00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
entrances here so I guess maybe they're

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:48.410

used to be because they used to have the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.850

together as a team to the ring but it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.149 
together as a team to the ring but it
looks<00:01:55.590> like<00:01:55.680> they<00:01:56.250> decided<00:01:56.850> to<00:01:56.939> opt<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.360> on

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159 
looks like they decided to opt for on

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.160 
looks like they decided to opt for on
separate<00:01:59.159> entrances<00:01:59.850> at<00:02:00.030> least<00:02:00.270> I<00:02:00.540> don't<00:02:00.990> know

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.510 
what's going on and why they are doing
this<00:02:03.450> but<00:02:03.869> maybe<00:02:04.140> it's<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.619> possibly<00:02:05.430> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
this but maybe it's a possibly a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.730 
this but maybe it's a possibly a
psychological<00:02:06.479> advantage<00:02:06.930> maybe<00:02:07.110> is<00:02:07.320> to<00:02:07.560> get

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
psychological advantage maybe is to get

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
thing to look into I guess the dirt

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.400

that was going to be up right there but

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.209 
that was going to be up right there but
I<00:06:28.789> guess<00:06:29.150> Trinity<00:06:30.050> somehow<00:06:30.500> kicked<00:06:30.830> out<00:06:31.009> and

I guess Trinity somehow kicked out and
now<00:06:31.340> another<00:06:31.639> cover<00:06:32.060> one<00:06:32.870> two<00:06:33.319> and<00:06:33.680> three<00:06:34.099> and
