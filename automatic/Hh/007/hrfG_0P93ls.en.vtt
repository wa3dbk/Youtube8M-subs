00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.819
 very good that so much in bullfighting I 'm going 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.029
 to explain this time with more in the 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.349
 marching guitar 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.719
 to make the guitar first 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:14.660
 You will need cardboard club once you have 

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:17.720
 the cardboard pen proceeds to make the 

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.880
 patterns and patterns will be the pieces 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.189
 of which the guitar will be formed in 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.649
 this case will be several pieces not 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:29.119
 it's just the ax we also have the 

00:00:24.649 --> 00:00:32.619
 part of the skull and the part where 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.619
 the rest of the pieces go 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 when we have the trained patterns 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.210
 we proceed to cut them when the 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:41.150
 we have cut off we focus on what 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.810
 the ax is coming 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.810
 if you want to have the edges well in thin 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.800
 what you have to do is with one with 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.360
 help of an electric sander pass it 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.250
 just by the edges 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.950
 on the one hand and on the other side of the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.020
 cardboard when you have all the 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.240
 pieces to your liking you have to 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.659
 paint them are painted separately and then 

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:09.740
 they stick to each other 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:14.100
 the neck of the guitar will be painted 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.770
 apart and will overcome apart with help 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 of a screw that is right here 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.420
 and what we can see here back I've 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.340
 left long so you can see it 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.920
 when you have all the pieces painted 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.619
 you only have to fit the ones 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.649
 to others with the help of glue I have 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.630
 used for tics no more nails is a 

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:36.450
 wonder seems to lie but does not strike 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.640
 everything when we have the guitar already 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 formed we proceed to add other 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.340
 details as for example are these two 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:46.229
 screws these screws 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.880
 you can find it in any 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:51.060
 hardware store 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.409
 this is also cardboard and it is a 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.270
 from here where do the 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.740
 strings if you are afraid of remaining 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.549
 loose then they are going to drop the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:03.179
 string is not added ais because if not 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.909
 you want something optional and then you have 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.640
 this piece that also goes separately and 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.759
 has six nails 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.000
 it's just sticking everything 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:17.060
 and let it dry with high order 8 and so 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.590
 is how the bass or guitar of 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.290
 march the link 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.510
 and well it really is very easy in the 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.280
 description I will leave the plans 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.340
 so you can do it just 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.430
 you will have to print them in a3 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.709
 and pull them forward just 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.470
 you will have to print them in a3 and that's it and 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.300
 join them and pass them to the cardboard and 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.700
 well nothing else this is the tutorial 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.620
 I hope it has been useful if you have 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.670
 interest in the makeup of marcel le 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:48.879
 can explain 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.650
 here 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:56.560
 finally they would not have to subscribe to me
