00:00:01.092 --> 00:00:03.840
All right, so
today I got something super special.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.876
We are gonna talk
about Pearlscale Gin Rin first

00:00:07.876 --> 00:00:08.984
&gt;&gt; All right Pearls

00:00:08.984 --> 00:00:11.090
&gt;&gt; Yep, so pearls.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.222
So you got diamonds,
which are a lady's best friends.

00:00:13.222 --> 00:00:15.810
And they're also big fans of
pearls obviously, right, so

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.158
these are definitely a lady's koi.

00:00:19.158 --> 00:00:22.600
Pearlscales are bred by

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.540
only two different breeders
in the whole world right now.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:26.190
&gt;&gt; No kidding.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.800
&gt;&gt; Kase and my main man Sekiguchi.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.380
Sekiguchi is my good friend, and
every year he saves some very,

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.940
very special pearlscales for
me and sends them out my way. Otherwise-

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.190
&gt;&gt; There's only two guys doing it.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.200
They're not easy to come by, no?

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.370
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they're very,
very, very rare, very rare.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:45.590
&gt;&gt; What a treat.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.410
&gt;&gt; And so Sekiguchi he does some
of the coolest pearlscales.

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.610
He does them all on this,
what we call  Jinbei Sanke bloodline.

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.571
Which is also a very old,
traditional type sanke.

00:00:55.571 --> 00:00:56.129
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.104
&gt;&gt; But you wanna look at
is how on each scale,

00:01:00.104 --> 00:01:04.316
there's a droplet of
silver on each scale.

00:01:04.316 --> 00:01:07.545
So it looks like a pearl
floating on each scale.

00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:12.620
&gt;&gt; It really does they're very, the
diamond ones or the ones that look

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:18.170
like a splash of rays they're
pretty erratic, spontaneous.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.640
You never know what to expect,
but these really-

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:22.750
&gt;&gt; Very uniformed and

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.450
strategic so to speak.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:26.160
It's interesting.

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:29.370
So this particular farm,
Sekiguchi, right now is very,

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:30.580
very famous for their Showa.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.050
That's what the two sons enjoy
breeding, that's their passion.

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:41.690
But their father made their farm
famous for these pearlscales.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.750
So they continue to breed
them as remembrance, and so

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.130
they don't want to ever
lose this bloodline.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.420
So they feel obligated to
breed these koi every year.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.017
&gt;&gt; And hopefully they'll go on for
generations and generations.

00:01:53.017 --> 00:01:54.270
&gt;&gt; Exactly.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.320
&gt;&gt; So you say it's rare,
only two people are doing it.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.120
When does this come out,
is this new or

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.630
is it old or-
&gt;&gt; We see

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.070
evidence of pearlscales
in the early 60s.

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.160
But Sekiguchi really sort of nailed
it quote unquote in the late 60s.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.690
&gt;&gt; In the late 60s and

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.750
then no one else has come up
with breeder from them or?

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:16.890
&gt;&gt; No, not really, not really.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.640
&gt;&gt; Is he just not
letting them out or?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.528
&gt;&gt; No, he lets them out.

00:02:19.528 --> 00:02:21.891
I think Kase is the other
guy who does them, and

00:02:21.891 --> 00:02:24.670
it looks like they have
an agreement between each other.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.892
Because Kase focuses on non
gosanke, so very like an unusual

00:02:29.892 --> 00:02:34.927
type koi, where Sekiguchi
really focuses on this variety.

00:02:34.927 --> 00:02:36.692
&gt;&gt; Well, that's a nice arrangement.

00:02:36.692 --> 00:02:37.192
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.450
&gt;&gt; So as this fish gets larger,
does that pearl,

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.250
those little uniform droplets,
does it tend to stay?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.790
We don't have any adults to look at.

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:47.341
&gt;&gt; Correct, correct.

00:02:47.341 --> 00:02:49.919
&gt;&gt; So what can we expect from one
of these guys as they get older?

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:54.739
&gt;&gt; So, specifically pearlscales
tend to get a little bit

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.200
faded out as the fish get older.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.970
So, in this particular variety,
I like to keep them small.

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.571
And that's what made diamond,
or dia-gin-rin so popular,

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:12.929
because that very, very strong
sunburst effect of Gin Rin really,

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:15.341
really lasts on a bigger fish.

00:03:15.341 --> 00:03:17.079
On a bigger fish, yeah.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.690
So, naturally we should
probably talk about that next.

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:20.710
&gt;&gt; Yeah, let's move to those guys.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.061
&gt;&gt; Yeah, go ahead and
let those guys go.

00:03:22.061 --> 00:03:24.175
&gt;&gt; Okay.
