00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
the best single handers in the world

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.390 
the best single handers in the world
they'll<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.530> this<00:01:40.680> position<00:01:40.920> where<00:01:41.310> the

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
they'll get to this position where the

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.950 
they'll get to this position where the
racket<00:01:41.760> head<00:01:41.850> is<00:01:41.910> much<00:01:42.210> higher<00:01:42.480> than<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.750> grip

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
racket head is much higher than the grip

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.140 
racket head is much higher than the grip
because<00:01:43.860> this<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.280> create<00:01:44.520> leverage<00:01:44.820> over

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
because this will create leverage over

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.630 
because this will create leverage over
the<00:01:45.240> ball<00:01:45.500> leverage<00:01:46.500> basically<00:01:47.040> means<00:01:47.280> force

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the ball leverage basically means force

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.640 
the ball leverage basically means force
over<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.120> ball

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:48.650 
over the ball

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:51.860 
over the ball
Plus<00:01:49.650> with<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.400> position<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.630> more

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
Plus with this position you have more

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.110 
Plus with this position you have more
space<00:01:52.230> to<00:01:52.440> accelerate<00:01:53.010> the<00:01:53.100> racket<00:01:53.430> head<00:01:53.520> if

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
space to accelerate the racket head if

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.840 
space to accelerate the racket head if
you<00:01:54.300> just<00:01:54.480> take<00:01:54.660> it<00:01:54.840> down<00:01:54.960> like<00:01:55.230> this<00:01:55.850> firstly

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
you just take it down like this firstly

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.219 
you just take it down like this firstly
you<00:01:56.940> have<00:01:57.090> very<00:01:57.300> little<00:01:57.510> leverage<00:01:57.930> over<00:01:58.110> the

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
you have very little leverage over the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.530 
you have very little leverage over the
ball<00:01:58.670> secondly<00:01:59.670> you<00:01:59.790> don't<00:01:59.970> have<00:02:00.090> much<00:02:00.240> space

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
ball secondly you don't have much space

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.830 
ball secondly you don't have much space
to<00:02:00.780> accelerate<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:02.190> from<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.850> getting<00:02:03.750> a

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
to accelerate so from here getting a

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.200 
to accelerate so from here getting a

from here you have an extra little bit
extra<00:02:08.970> space<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.240> accelerate<00:02:09.899> Plus<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.770> have

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
extra space to accelerate Plus you have

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.220 
extra space to accelerate Plus you have
more<00:02:11.130> leverage<00:02:11.730> over<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.060> ball<00:02:12.240> force<00:02:12.930> over
