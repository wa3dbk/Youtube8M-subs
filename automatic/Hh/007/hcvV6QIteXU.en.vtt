00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 even if goat sheep are 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.030
 apparently similar to each other some 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.610
 always detail and each race stands out 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.380
 presents an outstanding characteristic 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.440
 Let's now know what makes the 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
 difference in the suffocation race we will see the 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.470
 matter 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.539
 we're back here straight from the isi 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.760
 and you will now know what the 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.099
 characteristics to have a good male 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.330
 of the suffocating race eduardo cunha, which are 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.510
 these characteristics 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.969
 good if you observe this animal that animates it 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.160
 still young is an animal that does not 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:37.710
 completed its growth still because 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.809
 It is about a year but is observed 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.030
 the height of this animal in relation to 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.020
 our body he is almost one meter 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.079
 height 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 then imagine the potential of 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.230
 growth of this breed but when we 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.800
 we went to buy with went to get a 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.300
 mainly the suffocation we 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.800
 we have to observe 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.350
 precisely because of this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.690
 characteristic of the potential of 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.330
 production of meat gaining weight at the 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.360
 saturates this is the animal has to have a 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.619
 quite firm structure quite thick 

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:16.170
 for they hold that weight gain 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.780
 so that he can sustain his 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.780
 own weight because the animal in this 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.619
 when you reach adulthood with your 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.900
 two and a half years, he can 

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.930
 reaching about 200 kilos 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.970
 so to the height super dire 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.659
 another feature logically within 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.790
 of the breed standard is to attack the head that 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.259
 she is dark 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.799
 then the animal with the head fully 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.430
 black with the drought with the ear somewhat 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.740
 fall not too long but fall 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:54.079
 pending and she has some mobility 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:56.460
 with a good ear and eyelash session 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.130
 Natural 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.409
 it is not the ax when the animal has 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.140
 the chifrou have the horn toquinho 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:07.079
 should be disqualified should not be 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:09.149
 used for reproduction 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:12.150
 because it transmits these characteristics 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.600
 to the child and the race does not allow this is a 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.320
 animal that does not 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:22.780
 the quality of his year is not 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:24.910
 is not commercial in nature but can be 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.210
 commercialized so we do not give much 

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:31.510
 value to the question as in other races of 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.780
 the issue of ram but we should always 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.910
 notice that his skin is dark 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.830
 he is a totally dark animal with 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.360
 an interesting feature when 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:45.700
 He is born totally black and then only 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.100
 it is brighter yellow 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.500
 you notice that the animal quite 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.440
 fulfilled when compared to other 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.080
 meat-producing breeds and has a 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.570
 also quite fulfilled what 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:00.880
 becomes an interesting animal 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.370
 he is a champion one of the rare ones that have 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.400
 a more fulfilled profile higher 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:08.700
 you see how much meat you can allocate 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.700
 on here
