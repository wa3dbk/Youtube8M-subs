00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.410
 before the battle I came across this ground 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:34.980
 He thought of taking that he takes 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.150
 only 10cent 

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:42.360

 magic cent let me see just as I was 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.060
 I used but I still had a 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.909
 I have to make new ones 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:57.460
 this is all i bought today 

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:00.280
 I also got something because with 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.289
 make world the day such a competition true 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:05.530
 your nose you had to guess 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:08.830
 and I had that right when I got this one 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.869
 got a separate blanket that is actually 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.230
 for the pinto stallion but he already has 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:18.160
 what else to think of this he was made 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:22.239
 of leather and he is just so about it 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.900
 Head off in going around is tricky and on 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:27.549
 the b-side stands for rose horses 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.470
 I like the very nice travel set 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.660

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:44.980

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.430

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.670

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.720
 it also had two surprises and that 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.430
 this horse was on three points 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:02.440

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.090

 here is a hurdle that i have now 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.110

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.630
 this is an isham on instagram follows 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:48.720

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.670
 he can be at 3 different heights here 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.570
 I have these two stables 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:58.110
 around sliding doors and inside 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.790
 nightshade he finally has name and 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.860
 I have this blanket 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.870
 he is actually not for him he is 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:05.790
 for philips but that because otherwise on what 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.680
 I show 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:08.240
 this sign i still have for nightshade 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:14.870
 make one 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.870
 it is gray with white focus 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:24.210
 gray with white very simple just with 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:25.590
 brackets at the bottom and you'll find it here 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.110
 self 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.550
 and then here is a lot of x or 4x u printing 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.900
 pronounce 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.820
 infra I have a very new home 

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:35.790
 made 

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.500
 saddle with a real jumping girth that 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.890
 stuck 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.460
 so because i have copied from photo to 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:43.460
 this one 

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.240
 I've completely copied it here 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:52.760
 little thing 

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:57.500
 not that you are so about the moons of it 

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:59.720
 the single fixed and I first one 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:01.490
 make a double seal but this leather went 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.420
 broken so I changed it 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.420
 to this 

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:10.700
 bridle dress in which loosening he is 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:13.400
 adjustable and 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:19.280
 a thin fleece and only fits him nightshade 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:22.150
 so that is this new part too 

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:25.490
 so is can see here is just a mess 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.750
 this will also be a new part 

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:27.650
 this is completely full at the moment 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:29.919
 with horses 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:32.600
 just not paying attention that they stole new ones 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:34.000
 you still have to work and work 

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.340
 to clean up 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.210
 this was it for today that coffee it 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.680
 liked it 

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:40.680
 until next time
