00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.990
 Hi I am in my Vladimir Rozhin and 1 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:10.349
 place you say news first good 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.360
 news, I will now lay out my 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.890
 video on the free qualitatively new level 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.080
 and the second I found a very interesting secret 

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.990
 This is liberty city stories about unique 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.180
 unique sentinel machine with heavy 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.519
 Physics and practically the console punched 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:31.980
 I also started shooting a video from the beginning 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:37.160
 shoot and then record the sound and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:40.440
 so the mission nasa lion turaion means 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.110
 together with which he is called 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.539
 walk in the park now i'm quick 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.329
 while i'm writing something i need to do 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:53.250
 I'll check my device is fine 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:55.789
 no problem i'm sorry i am a little bit 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.710
 slowed down video i mean i have there 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.829
 The program and then it is called real 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.719
 joy light recommended it to me 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.510
 azazaza shusta day I watched the video 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:09.860
 I installed the link I just threw 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.630
 I advertise this program 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:16.590
 she can calmly download the index of the people 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:19.049
 and view the video zazy there everything is described 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.549
 everything is beautiful and in the end you 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:25.170
 You can see such vacu 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.509
 spread means well here is unique 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.670
 a machine 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:32.939
 I will tell everything in turn 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 then let's go weight she is 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.490
 next to the park in the second city 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:43.220
 start stone island 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:47.420
 or island so came to the park belleville 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.420
 the mission begins a walk in the park 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:57.530
 he chatters with the whole thing that that bastard 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.160
 could the mayor succeed him shorter blunt fat 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:05.630
 in the blue suit the mayor here they are 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:08.630
 most cars are unique they are black this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.410
 cent they are all armored almost westy 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.750
 Volga 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.690
 Naturally I will show everything and this one 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.930
 stupid mayor he will quietly pass now and 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.930
 go for a walk 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:29.290
 Well, well, our goal is to kill Lara 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.970
 also went to have somebody like 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:37.300
 motik motik 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:40.959
 and everything for the first time I see to vata cycle 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.390
 after what turned and realized 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:48.080
 other side what's the difference let's go 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.050
 first check that with these but the site and 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:56.870
 so little we can immediately immediately them 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:03:00.170
 pick up the device so there they are 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:03.440
 there we are passing here and here from 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:07.700
 this parliament building here they are 4 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.890
 things are driving men and how are you 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.320
 you see 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:14.780
 Well, the door is impossible to open, I advance 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.500
 I warn you the door you do not need to open 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:24.080
 do like this get in the car and how 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:26.299
 see you whisk can continue 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.340
 oh here and saw this and have a car 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.120
 sterols physics she can break 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:35.300
 cars with ease 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:38.630
 I think all the others too 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:42.550
 in the check in the chit that let's kill the mayor 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:45.410
 so that and as you see you are already shooting 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:50.840
 sorry that there is no sound here you see on 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:52.940
 shoot from guns with a gun tire 

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.510
 shed however the machine itself 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.940
 practically 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.820
 armored ie stand two 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:05.050
 line of M4 rifles and whether all 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:09.770
 here Kalashnikov with a machine gun with this with 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:14.270
 gatling machine gun I did not try to think and 

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:17.750
 bazooka, too, so what about us 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:20.630
 his commission for 1 here means to enter 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:23.240
 phone as you can see at this time 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:26.410
 he is under fire again may 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:30.470
 prove it very bulletproof 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:34.100
 most that now we are quietly going to 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:36.580
 home no problems will not be like any 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.500
 strange one star tracing just 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.820
 here take a look 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:43.970
 i don't know maybe this is just because 

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:45.590
 that I have a little device, but I think 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.610
 still pass this mission will 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.750
 hard that is just take kill 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.400
 go 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:57.310
 put and garage and then there is from the end 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:02.210
 will show 

00:04:57.310 --> 00:05:04.490
 column garage trawling but these here 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.340
 this is a machine with someone else's physics 

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:10.220
 just knocks on the go here look then 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:16.550
 there is also a hotel feature in that 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.620
 what are you but if that is all the rest 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.040
 cars look what physics you can 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:24.260
 see all they are after two or three 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.480
 blows i.e. they are after knocking down two 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.200
 three cars and starts smoking and this 

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:33.770
 cars so unique that as you can see 

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:37.430
 she didn’t even show up here with me 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:40.730
 there is such an application let's check 

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:43.789
 on the bulletproof this car out of it already 

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:50.419
 shot so i'm not responsible for what 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:53.720
 but as you can see, I’ll shoot 1 queue and 

00:05:50.419 --> 00:05:56.560
 it is still alive any other 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:59.419
 The car is already in it was lit. 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:01.700
 shot but see to it that it has 

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.760
 subjected to the field and so she stands 

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.310
 good where is the turn of ak-47 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:10.370
 now probably better ride this thing 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.960
 let's go then we'll go through again 

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.820
 let's keep it up 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:17.440
 take a look here it's big on too with 

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:22.400
 heavy physics I 'll show you later 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:24.800
 we pass close open and here 

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:28.669
 my main nuance is she does not look 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:32.200
 recovered let's do it again and 

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:37.280
 she is not recovering this is also a joke 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:41.660
 let's turn on and he calmly 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:46.130
 comes to home mission passed now 

00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:51.320
 you can calmly now get up again 

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:55.039
 let's take it down 

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.440
 I do not advise you to close 

00:06:55.039 --> 00:07:00.490
 so pretty tidy 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:04.750
 park ourselves come see now 

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:08.510
 let's read everything thank you for your attention 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.950
 Vladimir Troshin now your saved 

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:15.260
 subscribe put likes 

00:07:09.950 --> 00:07:17.330

00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.970
 means subscribe to the channel for 

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:22.550
 Naturally, I advertise the channel I repeat 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:25.190
 made a video using the program and repair 

00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:28.610
 joy light which I will give a link to 

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:32.000
 description thanks all let's check 

00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:33.860
 this car and as you can see after 

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.860
 she gets into the garage she unfortunately 

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:39.910
 loses its bulletproof it's a pity 

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.910
 well bye then
