because<00:00:32.640> of<00:00:32.880> our<00:00:32.969> innovative<00:00:33.420> new<00:00:33.600> hinge<00:00:33.840> a

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
because of our innovative new hinge a

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
because of our innovative new hinge a
massive<00:00:34.829> features<00:00:35.640> for<00:00:35.850> keyboard<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:36.360> we

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
massive features for keyboard and we

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.729 
massive features for keyboard and we
really<00:00:36.690> want<00:00:36.840> to<00:00:36.870> get<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.170> onto<00:00:37.410> Android

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
really want to get that onto Android

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.400 
really want to get that onto Android
again<00:00:38.010> one<00:00:38.370> of<00:00:38.460> our<00:00:38.579> devices<00:00:38.850> but<00:00:39.600> we<00:00:40.290> also

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
again one of our devices but we also

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.840 
again one of our devices but we also
need<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.800> to<00:00:40.890> be<00:00:40.950> the<00:00:41.070> strongest<00:00:41.460> thing<00:00:41.670> ever

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
need it to be the strongest thing ever

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.840 
need it to be the strongest thing ever
so<00:00:42.450> so<00:00:43.260> there's<00:00:43.410> a<00:00:43.500> bit<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.829> Z<00:00:44.100> as<00:00:44.460> a<00:00:44.520> bit<00:00:44.789> of

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
so so there's a bit of a Z as a bit of

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.580 
so so there's a bit of a Z as a bit of
as<00:00:44.940> leadership<00:00:45.239> and<00:00:45.780> their<00:00:45.870> shape<00:00:46.170> hinder

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
as leadership and their shape hinder

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.990 
as leadership and their shape hinder
going<00:00:46.860> on<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:47.070> there<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.430> that's<00:00:47.850> what's

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
going on in there and that's what's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.990 
going on in there and that's what's
inspired<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:48.510> name<00:00:49.190> it<00:00:50.190> just<00:00:50.460> keeps<00:00:50.700> the

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
inspired the name it just keeps the

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.270 
inspired the name it just keeps the
whole<00:00:51.239> system<00:00:51.510> really<00:00:52.230> really<00:00:52.500> strong<00:00:52.770> uh-huh

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
whole system really really strong uh-huh

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.450 
whole system really really strong uh-huh
