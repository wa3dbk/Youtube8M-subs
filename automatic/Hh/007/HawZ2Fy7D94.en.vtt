costs three generic and two colorless it

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.690 
costs three generic and two colorless it
has<00:00:36.870> for<00:00:37.200> loyalty<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.980> obviously<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.610> a

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
has for loyalty and obviously it's a

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.270 
has for loyalty and obviously it's a
jace<00:00:38.910> the<00:00:39.180> plus<00:00:40.140> one<00:00:40.260> is<00:00:40.500> draw<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> card<00:00:41.040> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
jace the plus one is draw a card and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
jace the plus one is draw a card and
target<00:00:41.969> player<00:00:42.149> puts<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> top<00:00:42.719> to<00:00:43.020> the<00:00:43.379> top

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
target player puts the top to the top

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.560

card of his our library into his or a

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.200 
card of his our library into his or a
graveyard<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.559> 0<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.129> target<00:00:47.760> player<00:00:47.879> post<00:00:48.120> to

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
graveyard the 0 is target player post to

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.029 
graveyard the 0 is target player post to
top<00:00:48.360> 10<00:00:48.539> cards<00:00:48.870> of<00:00:48.960> his<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.350> her<00:00:49.379> librarian<00:00:49.950> to

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
top 10 cards of his or her librarian to

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.279 
top 10 cards of his or her librarian to
his/her<00:00:50.219> graveyard<00:00:50.850> then<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.510> minus<00:00:51.840> 7<00:00:52.020> I

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
his/her graveyard then the minus 7 I

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.139 
his/her graveyard then the minus 7 I
guess<00:00:52.559> is<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.739> ultimate<00:00:52.980> any<00:00:53.820> number<00:00:54.090> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
guess is the ultimate any number of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.160 
guess is the ultimate any number of
target<00:00:54.510> player's<00:00:54.660> East<00:00:54.989> draws<00:00:55.289> 20<00:00:55.739> cards<00:00:57.170> ok

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
target player's East draws 20 cards ok

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.319 
target player's East draws 20 cards ok
see<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.680> don't<00:00:58.829> really<00:00:59.010> think<00:00:59.129> that<00:00:59.460> card

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
see it I don't really think that card

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.360 
see it I don't really think that card
itself<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.899> bad<00:01:01.050> i<00:01:01.109> think<00:01:01.559> is<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> effects

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
itself is bad i think is the effects

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.770 
itself is bad i think is the effects
that<00:01:02.460> are<00:01:02.640> bad<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.180> let's<00:01:03.480> just<00:01:03.539> say<00:01:03.750> for

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
that are bad like let's just say for

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.910 
that are bad like let's just say for
instance<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.320> you're<00:01:04.500> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.739> draw<00:01:04.890> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
instance like you're going to draw a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.740 
instance like you're going to draw a
card<00:01:05.189> and<00:01:05.400> somebody<00:01:05.850> mail<00:01:06.090> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.210> top<00:01:06.479> Kart

just<00:02:01.429> like<00:02:01.640> it's<00:02:02.270> just<00:02:02.450> like<00:02:02.630> um<00:02:03.969> yeah<00:02:04.969> you

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:05.239 
just like it's just like um yeah you

00:02:05.239 --> 00:02:07.539 
just like it's just like um yeah you
tapped<00:02:05.750> out<00:02:05.929> 45<00:02:06.319> that's<00:02:06.799> an<00:02:06.950> extra<00:02:07.219> turn<00:02:07.399> you

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
tapped out 45 that's an extra turn you

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.520 
tapped out 45 that's an extra turn you
had<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.789> wait<00:02:07.939> this<00:02:08.119> cast<00:02:08.420> him<00:02:08.720> and<00:02:08.929> pretty

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
had to wait this cast him and pretty

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.589 
had to wait this cast him and pretty
much<00:02:09.590> at<00:02:09.860> that<00:02:10.039> time<00:02:10.340> if<00:02:10.910> you<00:02:11.030> probably<00:02:11.329> turned

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
much at that time if you probably turned

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.539 
much at that time if you probably turned
four<00:02:11.870> or<00:02:11.959> five<00:02:12.110> when<00:02:12.290> you<00:02:12.379> drop<00:02:12.620> him<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.220> it's

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:13.549 
four or five when you drop him and it's

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:15.339 
four or five when you drop him and it's
kind<00:02:13.760> of<00:02:13.819> underwhelming<00:02:14.269> cuz<00:02:14.750> milling<00:02:15.110> card

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
kind of underwhelming cuz milling card

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.039 
kind of underwhelming cuz milling card
doesn't<00:02:15.680> really<00:02:15.799> do<00:02:16.069> that<00:02:16.099> much<00:02:16.480> and<00:02:17.480> of

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:18.049 
doesn't really do that much and of

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:19.150 
doesn't really do that much and of
course<00:02:18.110> this<00:02:18.410> isn't<00:02:18.590> going<00:02:18.769> to<00:02:18.829> be<00:02:18.890> using

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:19.160 
course this isn't going to be using

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.039 
course this isn't going to be using
legacy<00:02:19.640> because<00:02:19.940> dredges<00:02:20.420> like<00:02:20.599> the<00:02:20.780> nerds

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
legacy because dredges like the nerds

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.869 
legacy because dredges like the nerds
and<00:02:21.349> you<00:02:21.860> don't<00:02:22.010> want<00:02:22.190> to<00:02:22.280> help<00:02:22.340> them<00:02:22.549> out<00:02:22.730> with

00:02:22.869 --> 00:02:22.879 
and you don't want to help them out with

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.490 
and you don't want to help them out with
that<00:02:23.090> anyway<00:02:23.329> I'm<00:02:23.690> pretty<00:02:24.019> sure<00:02:24.230> you'd<00:02:24.379> be

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
that anyway I'm pretty sure you'd be

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.130 
that anyway I'm pretty sure you'd be
dead<00:02:24.650> by<00:02:24.859> then<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:25.670> anyway<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:26.060> I<00:02:26.629> don't

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
dead by then but anyway so I don't

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:28.569 
dead by then but anyway so I don't
really<00:02:27.200> think<00:02:27.530> it's<00:02:27.739> worth<00:02:27.890> it<00:02:28.099> because<00:02:28.160> you

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
really think it's worth it because you

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.650 
really think it's worth it because you
have<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:29.030> keep<00:02:29.930> him<00:02:30.140> alive<00:02:30.260> for<00:02:30.890> like<00:02:31.660> three

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
have to keep him alive for like three

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.160 
have to keep him alive for like three
turns<00:02:32.989> to<00:02:33.650> use<00:02:33.829> the<00:02:33.980> ultimate<00:02:34.750> but<00:02:35.750> you<00:02:36.049> know

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:36.170 
turns to use the ultimate but you know

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.050 
turns to use the ultimate but you know
you<00:02:36.230> can<00:02:36.440> only<00:02:36.470> use<00:02:36.680> one<00:02:37.190> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.549> effects<00:02:37.940> of

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
you can only use one of the effects of

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.390 
you can only use one of the effects of
turn<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:38.540> it's<00:02:38.720> just<00:02:38.870> like<00:02:39.109> I<00:02:39.709> won't<00:02:40.130> see<00:02:40.250> him

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400
