I'm gonna be altogether off anyway let's
do<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.380> other<00:02:56.440> side<00:03:05.280> okay<00:03:06.280> well<00:03:06.910> here<00:03:07.330> we<00:03:07.420> go

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
do the other side okay well here we go

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.950 
do the other side okay well here we go
proof<00:03:08.830> that's<00:03:09.120> just<00:03:10.120> as<00:03:10.300> effective<00:03:10.450> as<00:03:10.930> a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
proof that's just as effective as a

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.270 
proof that's just as effective as a
 rag<00:03:12.240> maybe<00:03:13.240> even<00:03:13.630> less<00:03:13.840> so<00:03:14.280> in

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
 rag maybe even less so in

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.310 
 rag maybe even less so in
conclusion<00:03:15.640> I<00:03:16.420> have<00:03:17.140> no<00:03:17.440> conclusion
