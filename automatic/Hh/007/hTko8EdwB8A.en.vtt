00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
it is three and a half quarts so it

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.089 
it is three and a half quarts so it
feeds<00:00:06.629> one<00:00:06.960> to<00:00:07.080> two<00:00:07.230> people<00:00:07.649> with<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.890> little

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
inside but remember that although it

inside but remember that although it
looks<00:00:13.349> large<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.830> still<00:00:14.160> should<00:00:14.370> only<00:00:14.639> fill

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
looks large you still should only fill

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.260 
looks large you still should only fill
any<00:00:15.120> slow<00:00:15.420> cooker<00:00:15.750> two-thirds<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.529> way

pictured on any slow cooker box you'll

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.759 
pictured on any slow cooker box you'll
really<00:00:23.189> never<00:00:23.430> fill<00:00:23.730> it<00:00:23.850> all<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.000> way<00:00:24.210> so<00:00:24.869> we

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
really never fill it all the way so we

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.370 
really never fill it all the way so we
did<00:00:26.099> prepare<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:27.119> meal<00:00:27.359> that<00:00:27.720> we<00:00:27.930> filled<00:00:28.260> it

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
did prepare one meal that we filled it

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.750 
did prepare one meal that we filled it
up<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.740> we<00:00:28.890> hadn't<00:00:29.070> even<00:00:29.130> put<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.460> rest<00:00:29.670> of

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
up and we hadn't even put the rest of

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.099 
up and we hadn't even put the rest of
the<00:00:29.849> meat<00:00:30.029> in<00:00:30.179> and<00:00:30.390> we're<00:00:30.510> already<00:00:30.660> filled<00:00:30.990> up

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
the meat in and we're already filled up

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.280 
the meat in and we're already filled up
this<00:00:31.349> high<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:32.090> it's<00:00:33.090> useful<00:00:33.570> to<00:00:33.600> have<00:00:33.809> both<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
this high so it's useful to have both a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.380 
this high so it's useful to have both a
5<00:00:34.530> quart<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.340> 3<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> half<00:00:35.730> quart<00:00:36.030> even<00:00:36.270> if

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
5 quart and a 3 and a half quart even if

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.940 
5 quart and a 3 and a half quart even if
you're<00:00:36.540> cooking<00:00:36.809> for<00:00:36.930> two<00:00:37.110> people<00:00:37.469> if<00:00:37.770> you're

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
you're cooking for two people if you're

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.500 
you're cooking for two people if you're
gonna<00:00:38.040> have<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> whole<00:00:38.489> lot<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.790> vegetables<00:00:39.360> in

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
gonna have a whole lot of vegetables in

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.670 
gonna have a whole lot of vegetables in
here<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.960> I'll<00:00:40.079> show<00:00:40.110> you<00:00:40.320> a<00:00:40.410> little<00:00:40.559> bit

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
here and I'll show you a little bit

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.040 
here and I'll show you a little bit
later<00:00:40.950> an<00:00:41.219> example<00:00:42.090> of<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.300> small<00:00:42.570> meal<00:00:42.809> that

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
later an example of a small meal that

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.119 
later an example of a small meal that
can<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.260> prepared<00:00:43.620> in<00:00:43.800> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
can be prepared in here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.200 
can be prepared in here
now<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.239> crock-pot<00:00:45.680> does<00:00:46.680> support<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.579> 24

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
now this crock-pot does support a 24

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
now this crock-pot does support a 24
hour<00:00:48.450> cooking<00:00:49.110> timer<00:00:49.500> so<00:00:49.770> you<00:00:49.800> can<00:00:50.010> actually

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
hour cooking timer so you can actually

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.110 
hour cooking timer so you can actually
cook<00:00:50.640> something<00:00:50.910> for<00:00:51.059> 24<00:00:51.780> hours<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.920> and<00:00:53.699> then

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
cook something for 24 hours and and then

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.200 
cook something for 24 hours and and then
it<00:00:54.239> will<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.570> an<00:00:54.780> 8<00:00:55.230> hour<00:00:55.820> warming<00:00:56.820> period

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
it will have an 8 hour warming period

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.060 
it will have an 8 hour warming period
that<00:00:57.360> it'll<00:00:57.539> hide<00:00:57.750> highlight<00:00:58.559> after<00:00:58.949> it's

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
that it'll hide highlight after it's

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.010 
that it'll hide highlight after it's
done<00:00:59.219> cooking<00:00:59.280> now<00:01:00.210> it<00:01:00.359> doesn't<00:01:00.809> have<00:01:00.989> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
done cooking now it doesn't have a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.200 
done cooking now it doesn't have a
delayed<00:01:01.410> start<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.100> lot<00:01:02.579> of<00:01:02.730> crock<00:01:02.940> pots

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
delayed start as a lot of crock pots

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.580 
delayed start as a lot of crock pots
don't<00:01:03.480> there's<00:01:04.110> probably<00:01:04.409> other<00:01:04.680> sorts<00:01:05.220> of

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
don't there's probably other sorts of

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.560 
don't there's probably other sorts of
issues<00:01:07.590> with<00:01:07.950> non<00:01:08.220> refrigeration<00:01:09.030> if<00:01:09.299> you're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
issues with non refrigeration if you're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.060 
issues with non refrigeration if you're
going<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.900> actually<00:01:10.080> have<00:01:10.320> a<00:01:10.439> delayed<00:01:10.770> start

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
going to actually have a delayed start

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.570 
going to actually have a delayed start
but<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.360> thought<00:01:12.630> this<00:01:12.810> was<00:01:13.049> great<00:01:13.320> for<00:01:13.560> us<00:01:13.710> a

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
but we thought this was great for us a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.530 
but we thought this was great for us a
few<00:01:15.240> things<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.750> note<00:01:15.930> is<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:17.130> glass<00:01:17.909> lid<00:01:18.270> is

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
few things to note is the glass lid is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
few things to note is the glass lid is
like<00:01:18.810> most<00:01:19.049> crock<00:01:19.380> pots<00:01:19.619> it's<00:01:19.830> not<00:01:20.009> really

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
like most crock pots it's not really

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.370 
like most crock pots it's not really
heavy<00:01:20.850> of<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.090> glass<00:01:21.299> lid<00:01:21.600> but<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.080> was<00:01:22.170> not<00:01:22.350> a

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
heavy of a glass lid but it was not a

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.950 
heavy of a glass lid but it was not a
problem<00:01:22.830> at<00:01:22.950> all<00:01:23.070> it's<00:01:23.880> continually<00:01:24.479> pushing

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
problem at all it's continually pushing

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.679 
problem at all it's continually pushing
out<00:01:25.110> steam<00:01:25.650> from<00:01:26.009> inside<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.580> pot<00:01:26.729> so<00:01:27.060> we

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
out steam from inside the pot so we

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.350 
out steam from inside the pot so we
didn't<00:01:27.900> actually<00:01:28.140> have<00:01:28.560> an<00:01:28.680> issue<00:01:28.860> with

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
didn't actually have an issue with

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
didn't actually have an issue with
really<00:01:30.360> needing<00:01:30.659> to<00:01:30.750> keep<00:01:30.930> it<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.140> because

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
really needing to keep it down because

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
really needing to keep it down because
it's<00:01:31.500> not<00:01:31.650> making<00:01:31.979> a<00:01:32.250> pressure<00:01:32.520> on<00:01:33.329> it<00:01:33.570> but

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it's not making a pressure on it but

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.390 
it's not making a pressure on it but
you'll<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.140> later<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> video<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.009> it

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you'll see later in the video that it

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.359 
you'll see later in the video that it
bubbles<00:01:35.790> out<00:01:36.030> through<00:01:36.329> around<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.049> ring<00:01:37.369> now

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
bubbles out through around the ring now

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.630 
bubbles out through around the ring now
the<00:01:38.970> inside<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.930> this<00:01:40.020> pot<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.439> very<00:01:40.979> heavy<00:01:41.369> I

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
the inside of this pot is very heavy I

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
pot so basically you need to use the

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.000 
pot so basically you need to use the
small<00:03:27.940> three<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:28.360> a<00:03:28.420> half<00:03:28.540> quart<00:03:29.110> when<00:03:29.560> it's

the right size for one to two people and

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.170 
the right size for one to two people and
it<00:03:32.410> doesn't<00:03:32.590> overfill<00:03:33.100> but<00:03:33.610> overall<00:03:33.940> it

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
it doesn't overfill but overall it

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.880
