00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
this a little bit better before the got

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.280 
this a little bit better before the got
the<00:02:09.489> remote<00:02:11.400> but<00:02:12.400> this<00:02:12.910> pioneer<00:02:13.629> head<00:02:14.260> unit

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
the remote but this pioneer head unit

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.539 
the remote but this pioneer head unit
Scott<00:02:15.120> I<00:02:16.120> got<00:02:16.930> the<00:02:17.080> color<00:02:17.290> settings<00:02:17.709> on<00:02:17.950> scan

everything this remember which

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:19.730 
everything this remember which
button<00:03:17.970> it<00:03:18.030> is<00:03:18.180> it<00:03:18.330> just<00:03:18.510> got<00:03:18.720> this<00:03:18.959> radio<00:03:19.380> so<00:03:19.650> i

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:19.740 
button it is it just got this radio so i

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.380 
button it is it just got this radio so i
can't<00:03:19.980> really<00:03:20.040> remember<00:03:20.310> putting<00:03:20.730> auxiliary

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
can't really remember putting auxiliary

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.900 
can't really remember putting auxiliary
there's<00:03:22.380> my<00:03:22.560> tuner<00:03:22.980> you<00:03:23.640> can<00:03:23.760> go<00:03:23.880> through

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
there's my tuner you can go through

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:29.840 
there's my tuner you can go through
stations<00:03:24.390> on<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:28.070> but<00:03:29.070> I<00:03:29.130> believe<00:03:29.370> my<00:03:29.640> hand

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
stations on here but I believe my hand

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:31.340 
stations on here but I believe my hand
10<00:03:30.060> wire<00:03:30.300> in<00:03:30.480> the<00:03:30.569> back<00:03:30.750> look<00:03:31.050> at<00:03:31.170> loose

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:31.350 
10 wire in the back look at loose

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.040 
10 wire in the back look at loose
because<00:03:31.610> stations<00:03:32.610> i<00:03:32.700> normally<00:03:33.120> used<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.810> get

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 
because stations i normally used to get

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:38.360 
because stations i normally used to get
they're<00:03:34.260> not<00:03:34.410> coming<00:03:34.920> through<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.100> believe

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
they're not coming through and I believe

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.720 
they're not coming through and I believe
it<00:03:38.550> does<00:03:38.730> pick<00:03:39.030> up<00:03:39.209> HD<00:03:39.840> stations<00:03:40.610> don't<00:03:41.610> know

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
it does pick up HD stations don't know

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.030 
it does pick up HD stations don't know
if<00:03:41.820> a<00:03:41.880> specific<00:03:42.540> HD<00:03:42.989> radio<00:03:43.350> but<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.680> does<00:03:43.830> pick

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
if a specific HD radio but it does pick

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.949 
if a specific HD radio but it does pick
up<00:03:44.190> HD<00:03:44.610> station<00:03:45.090> sometimes<00:03:45.630> because<00:03:45.810> it'll

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
up HD station sometimes because it'll

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.560 
up HD station sometimes because it'll
read<00:03:46.110> you<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.320> names<00:03:46.560> out<00:03:46.880> but<00:03:47.880> i<00:03:47.910> also<00:03:48.180> have

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:28.950 
going down the road and even when you

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.290 
going down the road and even when you
get<00:05:29.070> our<00:05:29.220> way<00:05:29.370> in<00:05:29.490> the<00:05:29.580> fourth<00:05:29.820> gear<00:05:30.060> you<00:05:30.270> can

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
get our way in the fourth gear you can

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.510 
get our way in the fourth gear you can
still<00:05:30.660> hear<00:05:30.870> the<00:05:30.960> exhaust<00:05:31.320> really<00:05:32.070> well<00:05:32.250> and

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
you couldn't before so that's pretty

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.850 
you couldn't before so that's pretty
much<00:05:38.040> it<00:05:38.430> try<00:05:39.360> to<00:05:39.419> ramp<00:05:39.720> it
