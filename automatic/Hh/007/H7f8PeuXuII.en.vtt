00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:40.980 
it looks awesome when you've got it on
stage<00:05:38.860> the<00:05:39.370> white<00:05:39.550> just<00:05:39.850> translates<00:05:40.780> real

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
stage the white just translates real

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.740 
stage the white just translates real
nicely<00:05:41.200> when<00:05:41.500> you<00:05:41.590> move<00:05:41.800> on<00:05:42.250> the<00:05:42.400> drums<00:05:42.640> so<00:05:43.420> I

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
nicely when you move on the drums so I

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.800 
nicely when you move on the drums so I
like<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.460> de<00:05:45.460> sort<00:05:45.670> of<00:05:45.730> homage<00:05:46.180> to<00:05:46.419> Buddy<00:05:46.600> Rich

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:46.810 
like the de sort of homage to Buddy Rich

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.740 
like the de sort of homage to Buddy Rich
and<00:05:47.080> thus<00:05:47.380> also<00:05:47.770> the<00:05:47.919> practical<00:05:48.419> fact<00:05:49.419> that<00:05:49.630> it

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:49.750 
and thus also the practical fact that it

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:51.930 
and thus also the practical fact that it
translates<00:05:50.590> visually<00:05:51.190> really<00:05:51.400> nicely<00:05:51.669> when

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:51.940 
translates visually really nicely when

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.070 
translates visually really nicely when
you<00:05:52.030> play<00:05:53.610> it's<00:05:54.610> a<00:05:54.730> lacquer<00:05:54.940> finish<00:05:55.450> and<00:05:55.690> it

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
you play it's a lacquer finish and it

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.990 
you play it's a lacquer finish and it
get<00:05:56.290> it's<00:05:56.530> greasy<00:05:56.830> it's<00:05:57.100> vegetable<00:05:57.550> oil<00:05:57.790> based

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.000 
get it's greasy it's vegetable oil based

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.740 
get it's greasy it's vegetable oil based
so<00:05:58.270> it<00:05:58.390> gets<00:05:58.810> a<00:05:58.900> little<00:05:59.020> slippery<00:05:59.440> and<00:06:00.750> that

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
so it gets a little slippery and that

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:04.260 
so it gets a little slippery and that
makes<00:06:01.960> it<00:06:02.050> sometimes<00:06:02.650> necessary<00:06:03.310> to<00:06:03.669> sand<00:06:04.030> off

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:04.270 
makes it sometimes necessary to sand off

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:05.760 
makes it sometimes necessary to sand off
a<00:06:04.300> little<00:06:04.570> bit<00:06:04.720> of<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.900> lacquer<00:06:05.140> when<00:06:05.710> I'm

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
a little bit of the lacquer when I'm

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.670 
a little bit of the lacquer when I'm
holding<00:06:06.010> the<00:06:06.100> state<00:06:06.280> but<00:06:06.720> it's<00:06:07.720> always<00:06:08.169> more

00:06:08.670 --> 00:06:08.680 
holding the state but it's always more

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.600 
holding the state but it's always more
important<00:06:09.070> to<00:06:09.400> look<00:06:09.610> good<00:06:09.820> than<00:06:10.030> to<00:06:10.060> feel<00:06:10.180> good
