00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.780
 if you look at the ipc we have there 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.330
 in the sky 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.090
 the planet venus is not much people confuse 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.869
 with a star it ends up calling a star 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:20.420
 Dalva 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.190
 but when in fact it is Venus then 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.290
 as soon as the sun sets 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.140
 now a little above the line of the 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:30.110
 Horizon Mr. Silver Point is 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.020
 the genre passed a little more 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.820
 few minutes time néné who will 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.969
 to appear soon after will be the planet 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.190
 mercury that for that week is there and 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:42.890
 on January 15th during week 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:45.649
 will be below feathers mercury 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:48.649
 also it has a silvery sheen but 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:50.839
 less intense compared to Venus and 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.960
 there around 8:30 in the evening 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.479
 summer season is starting to show up a bit 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.339
 more up the planet landmarks only color 

00:00:56.479 --> 00:01:00.769
 reddish game who has suddenly 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:03.739
 a telescope and likes a challenge 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.540
 use mars as a reference since 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:08.510
 You can see the boy in the color emart. 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:11.630
 reddish points the promat telescope 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.540
 Just try to locate a 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.310
 and bluish color of this celestial object 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.530
 It's going to be the return but it's not that simple. 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.130
 and observe what had aa January 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.060
 near mercury moon and also near 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.010
 to see if this is going to be an observation 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.320
 Wonderful who has a camera 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:33.710
 points to this instrument for this region 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:36.890
 from the sky the moon will be very fine on 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.550
 air but one thing is important has 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:44.030
 that having a west horizon free of 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.250
 building aches and even mountains times 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.960
 because suddenly bigger ahead of you already 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.760
 prevents you from being able to sell short 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:51.290
 need to be very close to the 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.870
 horizon is how they turned out 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.510
 visible just after dark asks for much 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.430
 Where the observer is in Brazil, right? 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.159
 at ten o'clock already starts to appear in the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.710
 northeast region near the region 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.710
 this and now I see that emerging with 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.959
 a brown color glows strongly gives 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:12.290
 and light pollution, how does the 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:14.959
 observation of 92 marks around 10 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.140
 hours searched the three Marys brings a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.280
 straight goes down in quotation marks, but this one 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.530
 we can use this expression 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:24.530
 down will have a star of color 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:28.370
 called Aldebaran and belongs to 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:31.099
 the consideration of the douro and a little bit 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.290
 further down near the ring of the 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.819
 between the northern horizon and the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.750
 highest point in relation to the observer 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.400
 The zenith has the Pleiades the Pleiades is a 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.920
 great referential cluster of stars 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.170
 very beautiful to be observed with 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.450
 binoculars are wonderful but a little 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.090
 above it we have there on the 16th, 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.750
 the commentary passing near the pleiades 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:55.730
 the star of baran is now is action 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.269
 those celestial objects that did not serve 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:03.819
 to get the worm and there 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.819
 scour the sky until you find the comment
