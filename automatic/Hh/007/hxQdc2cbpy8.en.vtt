00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.420 
the polar bear research we're doing is
very<00:00:30.630> unique<00:00:31.199> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.800> we're<00:00:32.099> the<00:00:32.160> only<00:00:32.279> place

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430

there's<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.260> lot<00:00:49.379> of<00:00:49.469> concern<00:00:49.800> about<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.100> polar

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
there's a lot of concern about the polar

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:52.970 
there's a lot of concern about the polar
bear<00:00:50.640> these<00:00:50.850> days<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.480> so<00:00:52.199> it's<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.680> a

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
bear these days and so it's just a

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.220 
bear these days and so it's just a
species<00:00:53.579> of<00:00:53.699> great<00:00:53.910> interest<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.690> we're

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
species of great interest and we're

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.930 
species of great interest and we're
concerned<00:00:55.440> about<00:00:55.559> losing<00:00:56.039> them<00:00:56.219> this<00:00:56.670> grant

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
concerned about losing them this grant

concerned about losing them this grant
money<00:00:57.059> is<00:00:57.270> going<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.539> help<00:00:57.780> us<00:00:57.989> really<00:00:58.230> take

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
money is going to help us really take

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.080 
money is going to help us really take
the<00:00:58.590> next<00:00:58.829> step<00:00:59.039> in<00:00:59.190> the<00:00:59.280> project<00:00:59.489> we've<00:01:00.059> been

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
the next step in the project we've been

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.240 
the next step in the project we've been
doing<00:01:00.449> some<00:01:00.660> preliminary<00:01:00.840> work<00:01:01.440> monitoring

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
doing some preliminary work monitoring

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.979 
doing some preliminary work monitoring
some<00:01:02.520> female<00:01:02.910> polar<00:01:03.149> bears<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.690> different

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
some female polar bears at different

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.270 
some female polar bears at different
cities<00:01:04.080> all<00:01:04.350> across<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.860> nation

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
cities all across the nation

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.000 
cities all across the nation
and<00:01:06.180> now<00:01:06.330> we<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:06.810> start<00:01:07.409> adding<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.770> study

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
and now we want to start adding a study

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.620 
and now we want to start adding a study
with<00:01:08.340> where<00:01:08.610> we're<00:01:08.760> looking<00:01:09.000> specifically<00:01:09.510> at

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
with where we're looking specifically at

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.510 
with where we're looking specifically at
males<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.409> what's<00:01:10.619> going<00:01:10.860> on<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.250> the

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
males and what's going on with the

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.399 
males and what's going on with the
effect<00:01:11.820> of<00:01:12.000> season<00:01:12.420> on<00:01:12.570> their<00:01:12.780> reproductive

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
effect of season on their reproductive

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.920 
effect of season on their reproductive
success<00:01:13.670> and<00:01:14.670> this<00:01:14.970> project<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.570> this<00:01:15.750> new

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
success and this project is this new

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.630 
success and this project is this new
money<00:01:16.200> is<00:01:16.409> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.619> allow<00:01:16.740> us<00:01:16.890> to<00:01:16.920> expand<00:01:17.430> it

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
money is going to allow us to expand it

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.920 
money is going to allow us to expand it
so<00:01:17.820> we<00:01:17.939> will<00:01:18.030> be<00:01:18.150> studying<00:01:18.360> both<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.750> males

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
so we will be studying both the males

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:19.999 
so we will be studying both the males
and<00:01:18.990> the<00:01:19.080> females<00:01:19.140> we'll<00:01:19.619> be<00:01:19.680> able<00:01:19.770> to<00:01:19.860> put

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
and the females we'll be able to put

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.740 
and the females we'll be able to put
that<00:01:20.130> information<00:01:20.369> together<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:21.270> really<00:01:21.630> get

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
that information together and really get

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.120 
that information together and really get
the<00:01:21.840> big<00:01:21.990> picture<00:01:22.409> about<00:01:22.500> what's<00:01:22.770> going<00:01:23.040> on

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the big picture about what's going on

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.170 
the big picture about what's going on
with<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.400> polar<00:01:23.580> bears

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
with the polar bears

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.330 
with the polar bears
yeah<00:01:25.170> the<00:01:25.290> target<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.740> year<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.040> tight

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
yeah the target this year is tight

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.830 
yeah the target this year is tight
because<00:01:26.670> we<00:01:26.909> just<00:01:27.060> found<00:01:27.240> out<00:01:27.479> about<00:01:27.600> the

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
because we just found out about the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.170 
because we just found out about the
award<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.070> we<00:01:29.189> have<00:01:29.340> until<00:01:29.610> December<00:01:30.000> 15th

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
award and so we have until December 15th

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.319 
award and so we have until December 15th
to<00:01:30.840> raise<00:01:31.369> $35,000<00:01:32.400> we've<00:01:32.850> raised<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.210> little

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
to raise $35,000 we've raised a little

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.330 
to raise $35,000 we've raised a little
bit<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> so<00:01:33.810> far<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.650> we've<00:01:35.009> got<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.159> ways<00:01:35.310> to

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
bit of it so far but we've got a ways to

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.219 
bit of it so far but we've got a ways to
go<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:36.060> at<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.360> end<00:01:36.450> of<00:01:36.509> the<00:01:36.630> year<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:36.930> we<00:01:37.049> can

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
go so at the end of the year if we can

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.929 
go so at the end of the year if we can
bring<00:01:37.409> in<00:01:37.560> that<00:01:37.710> thirty-five<00:01:38.250> thousand<00:01:38.759> then

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
bring in that thirty-five thousand then

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.760 
bring in that thirty-five thousand then
we<00:01:39.180> get<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:39.420> first<00:01:39.600> 35,000<00:01:40.530> from<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
we get the first 35,000 from the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.649 
we get the first 35,000 from the
foundation<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.610> then<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.180> same<00:01:42.360> will<00:01:42.479> be<00:01:42.570> the

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
foundation and then the same will be the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:43.910 
foundation and then the same will be the
next<00:01:42.899> the<00:01:42.930> second<00:01:43.350> year<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.680> third<00:01:43.710> year

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
next the second year and the third year

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.109 
next the second year and the third year
and<00:01:44.159> it's<00:01:44.280> really<00:01:44.310> going<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.640> help<00:01:44.790> us<00:01:44.939> advance

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
and it's really going to help us advance

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:56.500 
and it's really going to help us advance
this<00:01:45.450> project

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510
