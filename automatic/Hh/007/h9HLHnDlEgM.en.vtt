00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.160 

it's<00:00:00.480> the<00:00:00.900> second<00:00:01.650> test<00:00:01.970> so<00:00:02.970> I<00:00:03.389> have<00:00:03.689> switched

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
it's the second test so I have switched

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.570 
it's the second test so I have switched
on<00:00:04.620> the<00:00:05.220> heater<00:00:05.790> right<00:00:06.210> now<00:00:06.569> and<00:00:07.220> let's<00:00:08.220> see

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
on the heater right now and let's see

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.089 
on the heater right now and let's see
how<00:00:08.940> high<00:00:09.420> it<00:00:09.450> will<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:11.269> the<00:00:12.269> temperature

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
how high it will get the temperature

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:19.849 
how high it will get the temperature
each<00:00:16.250> sensor<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.760> both<00:00:18.180> ends<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.990> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
each sensor is at both ends of the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:31.990 
each sensor is at both ends of the
heater<00:00:20.100> itself<00:00:22.310> so<00:00:23.310> let's<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.820> how<00:00:24.060> I<00:00:24.090> will<00:00:24.539> do

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.870 

so<00:00:33.000> there<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.480> already<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.320> bit<00:00:34.500> of<00:00:34.620> warmth<00:00:35.160> and

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
so there is already a bit of warmth and

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.700 
so there is already a bit of warmth and
as<00:00:36.210> you<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.079> temperature<00:00:37.649> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
as you can see the temperature is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:46.029 
as you can see the temperature is
starting<00:00:38.070> to<00:00:38.280> climb<00:00:39.469> quite<00:00:40.469> high<00:00:41.219> now<00:00:42.530> 90.1

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:57.500 

18.6<00:00:53.899> my<00:00:54.899> last<00:00:55.590> test<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.550> initial<00:00:56.940> test<00:00:57.210> that

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
18.6 my last test the initial test that

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.369 
18.6 my last test the initial test that
I<00:00:57.539> did<00:00:58.140> this<00:00:58.379> was<00:00:59.370> that<00:00:59.399> it<00:00:59.879> will<00:01:00.239> go<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.899> about

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
I did this was that it will go to about

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.800 
I did this was that it will go to about
40<00:01:02.160> or<00:01:02.969> so<00:01:03.270> degrees<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:04.339> it<00:01:05.339> will<00:01:05.610> just<00:01:05.939> stay

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
40 or so degrees and it will just stay

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.980 
40 or so degrees and it will just stay
there<00:01:08.659> so<00:01:09.659> 39<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.530> 40<00:01:11.070> degrees<00:01:14.659> so<00:01:15.659> this<00:01:15.840> is

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
there so 39 to 40 degrees so this is

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:35.340 
there so 39 to 40 degrees so this is
already<00:01:16.170> one<00:01:16.590> minute<00:01:17.360> 15<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.659> has<00:01:18.840> passed

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.550 

so<00:01:36.350> from<00:01:36.860> my<00:01:37.130> other<00:01:37.520> video<00:01:38.170> from<00:01:39.170> the<00:01:39.350> better

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
so from my other video from the better

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.039 
so from my other video from the better
setup<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.460> would<00:01:40.670> have<00:01:40.939> seen<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.299> I<00:01:41.630> would

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:42.049 
setup you would have seen that I would

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:47.919 
setup you would have seen that I would
have<00:01:42.350> got<00:01:45.159> tanks<00:01:46.159> up<00:01:46.369> here<00:01:46.729> and<00:01:46.909> thanks<00:01:47.570> below

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
have got tanks up here and thanks below

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:54.700 
have got tanks up here and thanks below
but<00:01:48.799> I<00:01:49.179> suggest<00:01:50.179> you<00:01:50.539> do<00:01:50.750> not<00:01:50.960> put<00:01:53.170> the<00:01:54.170> tanks

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
but I suggest you do not put the tanks

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.950 
but I suggest you do not put the tanks
directly<00:01:55.039> on<00:01:55.579> top<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.420> because<00:01:58.420> of<00:01:59.420> you

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
directly on top of it because of you

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.380 
directly on top of it because of you
know<00:02:00.110> because<00:02:00.679> it<00:02:00.799> is<00:02:00.920> glass<00:02:01.280> and<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:02.030> can

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
know because it is glass and it can

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.260 
know because it is glass and it can
shatter<00:02:02.899> that<00:02:03.080> glass<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:04.190> won't<00:02:04.399> get<00:02:04.610> too<00:02:05.060> hard

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.270 
shatter that glass it won't get too hard

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.090 
shatter that glass it won't get too hard
like<00:02:05.450> about<00:02:05.750> a<00:02:05.780> hundred<00:02:05.959> degrees<00:02:06.259> or<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:06.830> like

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
like about a hundred degrees or so like

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.050 
like about a hundred degrees or so like
that<00:02:07.310> and<00:02:07.610> it<00:02:08.569> won't<00:02:08.720> build<00:02:09.110> a<00:02:09.319> fish<00:02:09.759> but<00:02:10.759> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
that and it won't build a fish but I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.479 
that and it won't build a fish but I
suggest<00:02:11.720> you<00:02:12.019> just<00:02:12.319> don't<00:02:12.650> do<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.040> just<00:02:13.280> as<00:02:13.459> a

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:13.489 
suggest you just don't do that just as a

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.479 
suggest you just don't do that just as a
precaution<00:02:14.799> as<00:02:15.799> you<00:02:15.980> can<00:02:16.160> see<00:02:16.340> the

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:16.489 
precaution as you can see the

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:20.589 
precaution as you can see the
temperature<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.510> 15<00:02:18.349> has<00:02:18.709> risen<00:02:19.130> to<00:02:19.599> 23

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
temperature to 15 has risen to 23

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:25.180 
temperature to 15 has risen to 23
degrees<00:02:21.049> and<00:02:21.700> 21<00:02:22.700> degrees<00:02:23.380> just<00:02:24.380> to

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
degrees and 21 degrees just to

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:28.960 
degrees and 21 degrees just to
double-check<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:27.280> connectors<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.489> this<00:02:28.730> as

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
double-check the connectors in this as

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.120 
double-check the connectors in this as
you<00:02:29.120> can<00:02:29.150> see<00:02:29.299> it's<00:02:29.599> just<00:02:29.709> poking<00:02:30.709> out<00:02:31.099> a

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:31.130 
you can see it's just poking out a

00:02:31.130 --> 00:03:03.400 
you can see it's just poking out a
little<00:02:31.670> we'll<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.480> push<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:32.930> right<00:02:33.200> in

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.630 

so<00:03:04.410> now<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.490> about<00:03:05.820> 26<00:03:06.540> degrees<00:03:07.080> and<00:03:07.640> 24

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
so now it's about 26 degrees and 24

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:25.700 
so now it's about 26 degrees and 24
degrees<00:03:19.850> this<00:03:21.050> will<00:03:22.050> run<00:03:22.350> about<00:03:22.530> 60<00:03:23.400> watts<00:03:24.710> at

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:25.710 
degrees this will run about 60 watts at

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:40.880 
degrees this will run about 60 watts at
DC<00:03:26.400> current<00:03:37.070> you<00:03:38.070> can<00:03:38.310> put<00:03:38.610> this<00:03:39.890> underneath

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
DC current you can put this underneath

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:50.270 
DC current you can put this underneath
or<00:03:41.370> on<00:03:41.400> top<00:03:41.640> of<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:46.730> MDF<00:03:47.730> shelf<00:03:48.090> or<00:03:48.680> so<00:03:49.680> you<00:03:50.100> can

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
or on top of a MDF shelf or so you can

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:52.190 
or on top of a MDF shelf or so you can
use<00:03:50.490> wooden<00:03:50.820> shelf<00:03:51.209> you<00:03:51.450> can<00:03:51.480> use<00:03:51.810> metal

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
use wooden shelf you can use metal

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.580 
use wooden shelf you can use metal
shelves<00:03:52.740> or<00:03:52.980> whatever<00:03:53.340> but<00:03:54.090> I<00:03:54.420> prefer<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.560> use

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
shelves or whatever but I prefer you use

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.800 
shelves or whatever but I prefer you use
like<00:03:56.310> anything<00:03:56.760> else<00:03:56.910> he<00:03:57.240> is<00:03:57.270> a<00:03:57.480> bit<00:03:57.720> of

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
like anything else he is a bit of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.870 
like anything else he is a bit of
insulation<00:03:59.870> like<00:04:01.010> styrofoam<00:04:02.010> or<00:04:02.550> something

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
insulation like styrofoam or something

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.970 
insulation like styrofoam or something
like<00:04:03.060> that<00:04:03.300> but<00:04:04.110> something<00:04:04.769> that<00:04:06.530> will<00:04:07.530> not

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
like that but something that will not

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.729 
like that but something that will not
you<00:04:08.790> know<00:04:08.940> will<00:04:09.360> not<00:04:09.540> dissipate<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.230> heat<00:04:10.260> as

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
you know will not dissipate the heat as

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.490 
you know will not dissipate the heat as
quick<00:04:11.070> as<00:04:11.190> possible

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.509 

as<00:04:14.500> you<00:04:14.680> can<00:04:14.860> say<00:04:15.040> at<00:04:15.160> 4:15<00:04:15.940> it's<00:04:16.450> gradually

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
as you can say at 4:15 it's gradually

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.950 
as you can say at 4:15 it's gradually
rising<00:04:18.519> the<00:04:19.150> temperature<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.870> to<00:04:19.900> 29<00:04:20.889> and<00:04:21.960> 26

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
rising the temperature up to 29 and 26

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.230 
rising the temperature up to 29 and 26
but<00:04:23.919> this<00:04:24.880> one<00:04:25.120> is<00:04:25.270> just<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:26.260> a<00:04:26.350> little<00:04:26.650> bit

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
but this one is just just a little bit

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:35.190 
but this one is just just a little bit
on<00:04:28.240> top<00:04:28.990> of<00:04:29.139> some<00:04:29.440> it's<00:04:30.130> just<00:04:30.460> not<00:04:30.900> an<00:04:32.190> inside
