regular sewing machine you might want to

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.460 
regular sewing machine you might want to

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
go for more of a 3/8 and I'm doing a 3/8

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.700 
go for more of a 3/8 and I'm doing a 3/8
to<00:01:08.130> 1/2<00:01:08.159> an<00:01:08.729> inch<00:01:08.850> hem<00:01:09.450> allowance<00:01:09.689> on<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.500> top

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
to 1/2 an inch hem allowance on the top

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.010 
to 1/2 an inch hem allowance on the top
and<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.070> leg<00:01:11.220> holes<00:01:11.460> and<00:01:11.790> don't<00:01:12.780> forget<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
and the leg holes and don't forget the

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.620 
and the leg holes and don't forget the
seam<00:01:13.170> allowance<00:01:13.409> at<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.500> crotch<00:01:13.770> seam<00:01:14.040> also

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
seam allowance at the crotch seam also

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.460 
seam allowance at the crotch seam also
so<00:01:15.630> now<00:01:15.659> we're<00:01:15.840> do<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:15.990> same<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.320> front

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
so now we're do the same with the front

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.140 
so now we're do the same with the front
and<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:17.100> one's<00:01:17.340> a<00:01:17.430> little<00:01:17.460> more<00:01:17.640> tricky

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
and this one's a little more tricky

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.880 
and this one's a little more tricky
because<00:01:18.360> we<00:01:18.570> can't<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:19.080> trace<00:01:19.380> around<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
because we can't just trace around that

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.789 
because we can't just trace around that
so<00:01:20.820> what<00:01:20.909> I<00:01:20.939> like<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.210> do<00:01:21.360> is<00:01:21.659> pick<00:01:22.229> one<00:01:22.470> spot

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
so what I like to do is pick one spot

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.640 
so what I like to do is pick one spot
and<00:01:23.159> mark<00:01:23.790> it<00:01:23.880> with<00:01:23.970> my<00:01:24.119> finger<00:01:24.450> lift<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.530> up

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
scrap knit fabric then we can flip that

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:23.370 
scrap knit fabric then we can flip that
over<00:04:20.519> and<00:04:21.090> lay<00:04:21.659> it<00:04:21.780> down<00:04:21.810> you<00:04:22.140> can<00:04:22.169> see

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:23.380 
over and lay it down you can see

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.740 
over and lay it down you can see
how<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.800> works<00:04:23.950> now<00:04:24.400> this<00:04:24.640> edge<00:04:24.910> is<00:04:25.300> going<00:04:25.630> to

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
how it works now this edge is going to

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.410 
how it works now this edge is going to
be<00:04:25.900> in<00:04:25.990> a<00:04:26.050> seam<00:04:26.320> the<00:04:26.920> top<00:04:27.220> edge<00:04:27.520> is<00:04:27.550> not<00:04:27.940> so<00:04:28.300> we

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:28.420 
be in a seam the top edge is not so we

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:30.510 
be in a seam the top edge is not so we
want<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.630> finish<00:04:28.810> that<00:04:28.930> you<00:04:29.800> can<00:04:30.040> fold<00:04:30.340> over

and<00:04:30.670> hem<00:04:30.880> it<00:04:31.000> Serge<00:04:31.810> it<00:04:32.080> or<00:04:32.320> use<00:04:33.310> a<00:04:33.340> pair<00:04:33.670> of

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
and hem it Serge it or use a pair of

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.350 
and hem it Serge it or use a pair of
pinking<00:04:34.150> shears<00:04:34.210> to<00:04:34.690> give<00:04:34.810> it<00:04:34.930> a<00:04:35.050> nice<00:04:35.200> edge

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
pinking shears to give it a nice edge

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.650 
pinking shears to give it a nice edge
like<00:04:37.620> this<00:04:42.000> now<00:04:43.000> it's<00:04:43.180> time<00:04:43.330> to<00:04:43.450> cut<00:04:43.570> the

like this now it's time to cut the

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:45.990 
like this now it's time to cut the
ruffle<00:04:43.930> fabric<00:04:44.080> and<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.740> requires<00:04:45.520> a<00:04:45.640> little

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
ruffle fabric and this requires a little

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.350 
ruffle fabric and this requires a little
more<00:04:46.180> care<00:04:46.450> than<00:04:46.480> a<00:04:46.810> flat<00:04:47.200> knit<00:04:47.470> fabric<00:04:47.920> so

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
more care than a flat knit fabric so

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.100 
more care than a flat knit fabric so
fold<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.480> over<00:04:49.690> and<00:04:50.140> then<00:04:51.720> make<00:04:52.720> sure<00:04:52.750> all

that<00:06:04.300> and<00:06:05.130> then<00:06:06.130> pin<00:06:06.490> those<00:06:06.700> together<00:06:07.060> so<00:06:07.300> you

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
that and then pin those together so you

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.060 
that and then pin those together so you
should<00:06:07.540> have<00:06:07.630> three<00:06:07.990> layers<00:06:08.140> of<00:06:08.320> fabric<00:06:08.740> that

you<00:06:09.190> will<00:06:09.310> sew<00:06:09.550> together<00:06:10.050> like<00:06:11.050> so<00:06:13.890> and<00:06:14.890> if<00:06:15.190> you

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:15.370 
you will sew together like so and if you

you will sew together like so and if you
open<00:06:16.090> it<00:06:16.420> up<00:06:18.660> you'll<00:06:19.660> see<00:06:19.750> our<00:06:20.580> partially

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:21.580 
open it up you'll see our partially

3/8 hem allowance you'll fold over 3/8

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:34.230 
3/8 hem allowance you'll fold over 3/8
of<00:06:32.470> an<00:06:32.680> inch<00:06:32.770> if<00:06:33.130> you<00:06:33.280> use<00:06:33.370> a<00:06:33.400> half<00:06:33.729> inch<00:06:33.940> you'll

and<00:06:36.009> you're<00:06:36.729> going<00:06:36.819> to<00:06:36.909> pin<00:06:37.060> all<00:06:37.180> the<00:06:37.240> way

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
and you're going to pin all the way

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.790 
and you're going to pin all the way
around<00:06:37.629> paying<00:06:37.960> special<00:06:38.259> attention<00:06:38.439> to<00:06:38.710> that

curve at the crotch on the front piece

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:42.149 
curve at the crotch on the front piece
because<00:06:41.110> it<00:06:41.229> will<00:06:41.349> be<00:06:41.439> a<00:06:41.469> little<00:06:41.590> tricky<00:06:41.979> and

00:06:42.149 --> 00:06:42.159 
because it will be a little tricky and

00:06:42.159 --> 00:06:43.679 
because it will be a little tricky and
you<00:06:42.219> also<00:06:42.580> want<00:06:42.789> to<00:06:42.819> make<00:06:42.969> sure<00:06:43.000> again<00:06:43.180> that

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:43.689 
you also want to make sure again that

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:45.779 
you also want to make sure again that
when<00:06:44.379> you<00:06:44.409> pin<00:06:44.650> the<00:06:44.770> back<00:06:44.949> piece<00:06:45.250> all<00:06:45.580> those

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:48.990 
when you pin the back piece all those
ruffles<00:06:46.300> are<00:06:46.569> laying<00:06:47.439> down<00:06:47.800> flat<00:06:48.280> in<00:06:48.699> the<00:06:48.819> same
