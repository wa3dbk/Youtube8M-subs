this<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.680> how<00:00:17.250> it<00:00:17.400> came<00:00:17.640> apart<00:00:18.090> I<00:00:18.390> was<00:00:18.510> careful

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
this is how it came apart I was careful

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.250 
this is how it came apart I was careful
to<00:00:19.020> make<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> note<00:00:19.820> of<00:00:20.820> the<00:00:21.240> sequence<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
to make a note of the sequence the

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.450 
to make a note of the sequence the
stacking<00:00:22.740> sequence<00:00:22.980> at<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> very<00:00:24.210> back<00:00:24.480> a

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
stacking sequence at the very back a

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:32.659 
stacking sequence at the very back a
small<00:00:26.460> washer<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:29.449> this<00:00:30.449> spacer<00:00:30.990> washer<00:00:31.669> and

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
small washer here this spacer washer and

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.780 
small washer here this spacer washer and
then<00:00:32.910> another<00:00:33.290> washer<00:00:34.290> here<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:35.309> putting<00:00:35.670> it

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
then another washer here is putting it

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.799 
then another washer here is putting it
Mike<00:00:41.930> and<00:00:42.930> this<00:00:43.079> random<00:00:43.940> small<00:00:44.940> washer<00:00:45.539> you

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
Mike and this random small washer you

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.569 
Mike and this random small washer you
could<00:00:45.989> see<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:47.360> haven't<00:00:48.360> cleaned<00:00:48.660> up<00:00:48.930> these

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:49.579 
could see I haven't cleaned up these

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:52.490 
could see I haven't cleaned up these
this<00:00:50.579> clutch<00:00:50.879> yet<00:00:51.210> I<00:00:51.480> wanted<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.050> leave<00:00:52.260> any

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this clutch yet I wanted to leave any

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.869 
this clutch yet I wanted to leave any
any<00:00:53.219> evidence<00:00:53.820> of<00:00:54.120> where<00:00:54.449> things<00:00:54.780> went<00:00:55.879> just

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
any evidence of where things went just

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.420 
any evidence of where things went just
to<00:00:57.090> be<00:00:57.180> sure<00:00:57.210> now<00:00:58.199> there<00:00:58.530> we<00:00:58.710> are<00:00:58.739> that's<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
to be sure now there we are that's the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.600 
to be sure now there we are that's the
I'll<00:01:00.120> take<00:01:00.329> that<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:01.370> turn<00:01:02.370> that<00:01:02.489> over<00:01:04.610> they

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
I'll take that off turn that over they

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.300 
I'll take that off turn that over they
will<00:01:05.790> go<00:01:06.000> underneath<00:01:06.780> just<00:01:07.520> put<00:01:08.520> them<00:01:08.640> there

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
will go underneath just put them there

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:17.940 
will go underneath just put them there
yep<00:01:12.530> then<00:01:13.530> we<00:01:13.710> have<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.340> spacer

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.749 

which<00:01:18.460> slots<00:01:18.790> in<00:01:19.030> there<00:01:19.799> and<00:01:20.799> we<00:01:21.009> have<00:01:21.280> the

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
which slots in there and we have the

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.560 
which slots in there and we have the
bearing

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.480 

a<00:01:28.150> spacer<00:01:29.150> plate<00:01:30.130> washer

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.350 

of<00:01:35.240> course<00:01:36.399> in<00:01:37.399> a<00:01:37.549> plan<00:01:37.790> to<00:01:38.000> be<00:01:38.149> the<00:01:39.110> basket

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.789 

this<00:01:44.360> is<00:01:45.100> what<00:01:46.100> I<00:01:46.220> found<00:01:46.960> here<00:01:47.960> I'm<00:01:48.590> not

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:48.799 
this is what I found here I'm not

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.450 
this is what I found here I'm not
convinced<00:01:49.490> but<00:01:49.670> there<00:01:50.060> we<00:01:50.210> are

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:51.460 
convinced but there we are

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:59.550 
convinced but there we are
this<00:01:52.460> washer<00:01:53.770> was<00:01:54.770> there<00:01:57.850> then<00:01:58.850> we<00:01:59.000> have<00:01:59.030> this

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
this washer was there then we have this

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.690 
this washer was there then we have this
leaf<00:02:00.580> washer<00:02:02.020> returning<00:02:03.020> washer<00:02:03.439> it<00:02:04.369> needs<00:02:04.580> to

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
leaf washer returning washer it needs to

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.889 
leaf washer returning washer it needs to
be<00:02:04.759> straightened<00:02:05.090> up<00:02:05.240> and<00:02:05.390> clean<00:02:05.659> because

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:05.899 
be straightened up and clean because

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:10.809 
be straightened up and clean because
those<00:02:06.289> wings<00:02:06.679> as<00:02:07.220> you'll<00:02:07.429> see<00:02:08.679> notches<00:02:09.819> they

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
those wings as you'll see notches they

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:14.380 
those wings as you'll see notches they
will<00:02:11.060> fall<00:02:11.330> they<00:02:11.660> will<00:02:11.690> fall<00:02:12.049> into<00:02:12.350> their<00:02:13.390> the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
will fall they will fall into their the

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.250 
will fall they will fall into their the
washer<00:02:14.600> itself<00:02:15.170> can<00:02:15.610> fold<00:02:16.610> over<00:02:16.850> and<00:02:17.269> prevent

this enough from moving now I did expect

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.370 
this enough from moving now I did expect
to<00:02:21.830> see<00:02:22.040> a<00:02:22.390> different<00:02:23.390> type<00:02:23.420> of<00:02:23.630> washer<00:02:24.200> to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
to see a different type of washer to
