 in which I present the selection that 

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.800
 I have played the world tournament of 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.880

 this well on screen is about 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.470
 Uruguay and well, I'm going to go all 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.270
 world you will have seen the trailer of the 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.400
 tournament I uploaded it to my channel and also 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.759
 the rest of youtube participants is the 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.260
 nice doctor if chicken see woman 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:38.230
 primary area of ​​anif and fax stream or 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.450
 remember and black and good this video more 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.100
 that nothing for you to know the team with 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.680
 the one that I'm going to play in my group has 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.649
 played play against stream or remember and 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.789
 márkaris a fifa professional player and 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:51.489
 The truth is that I do not know how I'm going to 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.859
 escape because I already two weeks without 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.030
 play this game between taking a 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:57.219
 World Cup update and that now 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.890
 giving the final exams of the 

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.800
 university because it does not play absolutely 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.660
 nothing 

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.089
 and on the subject of raising the matches 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.470
 that is playing the tournament to the channel as 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.070
 I will not have much time for the subject 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.950
 to edit the comments and more 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.690
 sure is that if it comes up with the 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.540
 summaries with background music so that 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.720
 ye shall see each group matches 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.860
 because I already believe that for the phase of 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.360
 eliminatory rounds in the event that 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.360
 will happen of the group then yes that I will already have 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.070
 finished the exam and be able to bring the 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.600
 summaries better done but good what 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.580
 important is that you know in this case 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.190
 the equipment in portillo we have a muslera 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.920
 the right side is lateral pereira 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.180
 left also another pereira in this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.550
 case as he is living in the middle 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:43.220
 left I used the player because 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.220
 of the left media of uruguay the 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.950
 that most resembles having statistics of 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:51.950
 a defense with that 81 of pace 75 of 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.360
 defense and 74 head plus on its top 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.710
 the Portuguese league this player is 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.090
 equaled played from lateral I think that by 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.979
 that this already keeps some of those 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.050
 defensive statistics that the truth 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:01.039
 that are not bad and in the case of 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.800
 Uruguay that has no side 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.590
 left it so much 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.720
 play with this player here or 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.950
 just use three defense and I do not 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.380
 I was going to play with the defense of three 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.330
 true as regards the central martins 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.850
 Cáceres and you say that I already had them in 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.980
 club midfielder defensive arévalos rivers 

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:20.020
 and gonzález that you also try it together 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.200
 with godín and cáceres in the team 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.940
 drogba and jill plus the left band is 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.370
 for the onion rodríguez right band 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.840
 for urretavizcaya the only player of 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.420
 team's silver and because it does not have 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.290
 uruguay gold players in this 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:37.510
 demarcation had better statistics 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.160
 except in the current rhythm and the player 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.810
 of espanyol but the truth is that I do not 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:44.710
 I ended up convincing and betting 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.120
 this one better and both the two men 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.860
 team keys as in the center 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.260
 offensive we have Luis Suarez and in 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.790
 putada that cavani I used the visual 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.420
 of offensive midfielder because I consider 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.490
 that having that dribbling ability and 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:59.680
 of bad legs is better for me 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.570
 control the ball at the edge of the area and 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.520
 cavani that is a bit more of style 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.870
 auctioneer I have it there in the area 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:07.870
 always ready to put any 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.670
 rejection or ball that arrives and good 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.920
 this is the team basically 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.090
 I've only tried three players 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.430
 all the equipment as I said 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:17.260
 formerly godín and cáceres y gonzález 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.030
 that they use the trofa and hill team 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.760
 the rest are a real mystery 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.560
 although I guess that cavani and suárez will go 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:26.709
 Well, we'll have to see how the 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.540
 experiment of pereiras due left 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.280
 to the left side and good 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.810
 then I will leave again as 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.890
 always only leave goals on the team 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.020
 that I bring to the channel and in this case 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.090
 I have not tried it yet, I 'm going to leave it 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:39.239
 again with the tournament trailer for 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.410
 all those who could not see it 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.000
 leave me in your comments that you 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.680
 it seems this team if you think it 

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.350
 can improve speak of players 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:50.940
 normal I do not have coins to attract 

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.650

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.860
 said earlier I'm not playing 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.810
