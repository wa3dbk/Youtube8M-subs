00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.749
 the first house 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.699
 for 

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.979
 did you know that airspace surveillance is actually at 150 

00:00:23.979 --> 00:00:26.050
 meters underground 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.140
 Hello 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.290
 we are in the bowels of the earth one of the concrete slabs where 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.590
 find the center of detection and control of the southeast quarter of France 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.330
 six kilometers of tunnels France 24,550 people can live in autarky 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.070
 for more than eight days in case of nuclear or chemical attack the euro 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.150
 is much better at the line fighting the airbase 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.500
 a veto submarine within the movement 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.690
 welcome to the 942 base of the world will lose a place classified secret-defense 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.240
 well to some me underground feel I feel very good it's this 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.080
 which we call the strada 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.520
 a center of detection and control hotspot battery 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.430
 35% antiaircraft 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.170
 150 people take turns 24 hours a day every day of the year these 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.330
 sky controllers suite on their screen anything that flies above our 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.790
 heads civil or military planes nothing escapes them alpha condÃ© this death 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.370
 it's our main mission 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.130
 it's one of the parts of the permanent posture of safety it's some 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.270
 something that is not new in France since 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.190
 togola years ago that our system of transmitting 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.220
 air defense information allows us to have a global vision that 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.890
 the French territories dimitra fiction flight daily france and 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.950
 so we have practically between a fifth and a quarter of that gives 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.800
 money for his French habits drop by 5 years and less than 1500 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.160
 rahimi translated by day because we have to identify and follow and the 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:53.690
 intercepted training 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.150
 to the inverted he decides to send from a neighboring base planes burst mirage 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:59.200
 equipped with air-to-air missiles 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.570
 in the hunt for a suspected plane 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.820
 whatever the type of device 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.210
 questionable behavior overflight of prohibited areas small nuclear power plants 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:09.389
 or agglomerations 

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.499
 since the attacks of September 11, 2001 the level of alert in the sky 

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:14.969
 French permanences 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:18.309
 not a day goes by without the mirages intervening 

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:21.709
 these sentinels of air posted 150 meters underground 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.649
 are connected with twenty or so radars 

00:02:25.649 --> 00:02:29.609
 two of which are located a stone's throw from the 942 bass 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.609
 guided tour of what is called in the region 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:39.569
 in the Arab imagination 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.569
 meeting in the microwave in the end this neighboring town 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:46.599
 and there we have 12 million votes 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:48.129
 it fits a little 

00:02:48.129 --> 00:02:51.129
 at the energy level 

00:02:54.469 --> 00:02:57.639
 this radar of the 70s is one of the most powerful in europe 

00:02:58.259 --> 00:03:01.689
 with its 14 meters in diameter and cover a radius of 400 km 

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:05.939
 this is for today but from next year at the base of my father 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.709
 it will take some gallon 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:10.319
 inaugurated thirty years ago in the middle of the cold war 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.419
 perched on the golden mountains 10 km from lyon 

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:17.479
 this 115 hectare structure under high surveillance has recently been 

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:19.649
 chosen to plan and manage 

00:03:19.649 --> 00:03:22.939
 all missions of the Air Force in France and abroad 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:26.399
 brawl hitherto devolves to the base of Tamiflu in the Paris region 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.519
 in clear my father one will become the national pillar of air defense 

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:34.819
 the first stone of this building was laid in December 2006 and the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.149
 work progresses at no charge the building will host the command 

00:03:38.149 --> 00:03:41.149
 national operations 

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:47.459
 but especially the 942 base to internationalize 

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:52.269
 we have always worked in my childhood with time 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.790
 but there we pushed through this program unfolds on the bench 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.439
 of Arguin 

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:58.569
 maximum interoperability 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:01.729
 it means that you take an aviator I work it's the world 

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:02.459
 Latin 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.239
 or parachute their death 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.559
 he will find the same elements the same equipment the same methods 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:08.319
 working 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:11.089
 we will be drinking clearly interoperable lack 

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:14.239
 back in the air guitar world's powerhouses the nail of the visit continues 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:17.139
 the officer from all over France 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.269
 it is this operating room approved as much 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.630
 the purpose eventually formed rare common space surveillance networks 

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:25.300
 European air 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.979
 and drive from here foreign operations of the title except for blow in 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:30.999
 afghanistan pass more 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:32.699
 so of dissent 

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:33.889
 Anti-depressant 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:36.729
 will open on the horizon 2010 2011 

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.150
 shaken in this room is the future the future of contador plus the return of the 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.400
 policy the commitment decision in favor of the agreement 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.150
 Syrian officers as well as French soldiers will come to 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.430
 in this respect to conclude the broadcast together 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:52.830
 duprÃ© under the aegis content 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.830
 but who can very well be also under the aegis of the world 

00:04:58.569 --> 00:05:01.789
 during this time surface that privilege commandos tasked with 

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:03.570
 central site protection 

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.890
 at the top 14 8 sercices of muscular arrests of a child 

00:05:08.189 --> 00:05:10.839
 then the firefighters these exercises 

00:05:10.839 --> 00:05:14.240
 for a total of forty trades represented on the bass 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:16.559
 nobody works 

00:05:16.559 --> 00:05:18.650
 tomorrow they will be 1500 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:22.849
 now the heart of our air defense is no longer called taverny 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:23.909
 but guillaume aubertin
