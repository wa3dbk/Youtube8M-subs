00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello to all Caesar and as always I hope 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.549
 that they are very well and that they have had 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.049
 a nice week today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.300
 I will teach how to make a cake called 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.160
 cake that never fails and definitely 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.960
 It is very easy and quick to do the 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
 comparison with other cakes that exist 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.680
 I think it's a very good idea if 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.380
 soon some family member or friend birthday 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.820
 or if you want to give her a gift 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.320
 someone and you are not from the super chivas 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.170
 Well, you're going to look great with this 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.510
 so then let's see how 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:31.710
 we need sugar 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.710
 wheat flour 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.850
 baking powder 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.090
 two round or rectangular molds 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.090
 20 centimeters in diameter 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 cornstarch 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.850
 Orange juice 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.730
 butter 3 eggs 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.260
 and vegetable oil 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.180
 the first thing is to preheat the oven to 350 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.080
 Fahrenheit grades oil and flour 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.080
 the two molds 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.180
 i 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:35.550
 in a bowl we will beat 3 yolks 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:35.550
 of egg with a half cup of sugar 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.360
 two 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.110
 then we add a quarter cup of 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.110
 oil and we're going to sandwich a cup of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.210
 flour and a teaspoon of 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.600
 bake with a half cup of juice 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.600
 orange 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 i 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 3 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.379
 in another container we are going to beat 3 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.530
 egg whites to snow point with a 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.689
 pinch of salt and let's add a quarter 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.689
 of sugar cup little by little 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.599
 now we incorporate both mixtures 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.560
 gently until we are left 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.069
 totally yellow 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.069
 yes 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:27.939
 do not 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.310
 and when it's ready we're going to open it 

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.610
 between the two baking molds 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.799
 from 25 to 30 minutes or until the 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.799
 insert a stick this one comes out clean 

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:49.230
 two 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:51.450
 to make the orange filling we're going to 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.910
 Mix a half cup in the blender 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.890
 of sugar with a cup of juice 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.250
 orange and when this is already a moved 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:02.660
 let's put an egg yolk and a 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.660
 spoonful of cornstarch 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:15.190
 when everything is already built it 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.489
 we transfer to a pot and we 're going to 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.530
 put on fire leaving boiling stirring 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:23.910
 with a wooden spoon up here 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.910
 also creamy consistency 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.810
 and we're going to let him cool to put together the 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.220
 we are going to disassemble the halves and if 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.199
 they feel that depronto is necessary 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.350
 cut some to fit well 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.660
 Well, they can do it and we're going to spread 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.660
 each of the halves with the cream of 

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.960
 orange and we're going to cover it with the other 

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:44.960
 half 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.740
 If they want they can leave it like that or 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.260
 they can make a cover what I did 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.910
 was to put more cream on top and for 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:14.370
 all around and then I put sugar 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:17.070
 pulverized and this I need that I have 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.610
 lots of colorful little pitas for 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:19.610
 over 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:36.570
 that was all for today I hope you have them 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.920
 very much liked that easy because not 

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:40.320
