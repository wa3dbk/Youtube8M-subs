hi folks dave ever hear from mr. herbert
science<00:00:06.540> class<00:00:06.839> i<00:00:07.200> wanted<00:00:07.799> to<00:00:07.890> show<00:00:08.069> you<00:00:08.099> a<00:00:08.250> set

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
science class i wanted to show you a set

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:11.330 
science class i wanted to show you a set
of<00:00:08.639> iphones<00:00:09.150> that<00:00:09.630> i<00:00:09.929> think<00:00:10.230> would<00:00:11.130> be<00:00:11.309> really

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
of iphones that i think would be really

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.190 
of iphones that i think would be really
a<00:00:11.639> great<00:00:11.969> idea<00:00:12.389> i've<00:00:12.540> been<00:00:12.719> thinking<00:00:13.080> about

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
a great idea i've been thinking about

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.860 
a great idea i've been thinking about
these<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.980> designed<00:00:14.670> this<00:00:14.820> idea<00:00:15.240> about<00:00:15.330> 25

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
these and designed this idea about 25

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.250 
these and designed this idea about 25
years<00:00:16.139> ago<00:00:16.470> but<00:00:16.740> here's<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.609> way<00:00:17.760> it<00:00:17.910> works

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.260 
years ago but here's the way it works

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.769 
years ago but here's the way it works
they<00:00:19.260> are<00:00:19.439> connected<00:00:20.090> to<00:00:21.090> your<00:00:21.680> camera<00:00:22.680> and

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
they are connected to your camera and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.630 
they are connected to your camera and
all<00:00:24.779> you<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.320> do<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.920> put<00:00:26.189> these<00:00:26.369> on<00:00:26.609> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
all you have to do is put these on and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.720 
all you have to do is put these on and
you<00:00:26.970> don't<00:00:27.180> look<00:00:27.330> at<00:00:27.480> any<00:00:28.550> reflections<00:00:29.550> in<00:00:29.699> the

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
you don't look at any reflections in the

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.790 
you don't look at any reflections in the
screens<00:00:30.150> anymore<00:00:30.750> or<00:00:31.019> anything<00:00:31.529> tiny<00:00:31.980> little

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
screens anymore or anything tiny little

screens anymore or anything tiny little
iPhones<00:00:35.059> so<00:00:36.059> you<00:00:36.149> can<00:00:36.450> see<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.440> you're

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
iPhones so you can see what you're

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.040 
iPhones so you can see what you're
recording<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.790> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.510> plug<00:00:39.690> this<00:00:39.780> into<00:00:39.989> your

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
recording or you can plug this into your

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
back in nineteen seventy six when i was

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.979 
back in nineteen seventy six when i was
working<00:00:58.020> at<00:00:58.440> lark<00:00:58.949> engineering<00:00:59.989> tuning

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989

working at lark engineering tuning
electronic<00:01:01.530> microwave<00:01:02.010> filters<00:01:02.280> i<00:01:03.650> had<00:01:04.650> come

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
electronic microwave filters i had come

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.410 
electronic microwave filters i had come
up<00:01:05.010> with<00:01:05.129> an<00:01:05.250> idea<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.670> i<00:01:05.909> called<00:01:06.210> these

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
up with an idea and i called these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.649 
up with an idea and i called these
iphones<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:08.610> seemed<00:01:08.909> to<00:01:09.119> me<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.299> this

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
iphones and it seemed to me that this

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.580 
iphones and it seemed to me that this
would<00:01:09.869> always<00:01:10.200> work<00:01:10.470> using<00:01:11.270> projection

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:12.590 
would always work using projection

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590 
would always work using projection
projectors<00:01:13.590> here<00:01:13.860> onto<00:01:14.820> a<00:01:14.850> screen<00:01:15.119> in<00:01:15.450> front

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
projectors here onto a screen in front

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.749 
projectors here onto a screen in front
you<00:01:15.930> would<00:01:16.110> wear<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.439> glasses<00:01:16.680> just<00:01:17.640> like

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
you would wear the glasses just like

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.270 
you would wear the glasses just like
good<00:01:18.030> wear<00:01:18.299> earphones<00:01:18.540> so<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.860> call<00:01:20.130> them

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
good wear earphones so I call them

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.640 
good wear earphones so I call them
iphones<00:01:20.729> and<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:21.689> technicians<00:01:22.229> they're<00:01:22.409> all

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
iphones and the technicians they're all

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.200 
iphones and the technicians they're all
thought<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:22.920> was<00:01:23.189> crazy<00:01:23.369> course<00:01:23.939> now<00:01:24.180> it's

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
thought I was crazy course now it's

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.960 
thought I was crazy course now it's
pretty<00:01:24.659> much<00:01:24.869> virtual<00:01:25.439> reality<00:01:26.070> but<00:01:26.670> this<00:01:26.820> was

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
pretty much virtual reality but this was

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.219 
pretty much virtual reality but this was
the<00:01:27.409> drawing<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.619> I<00:01:28.680> had<00:01:28.979> back<00:01:29.220> then<00:01:29.460> also

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
the drawing that I had back then also

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.530 
the drawing that I had back then also
today's<00:01:31.229> cameras<00:01:32.189> with<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
today's cameras with all of the

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.560 
today's cameras with all of the
reflections<00:01:34.439> and<00:01:34.880> difficult<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.060> see<00:01:36.299> outside

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
reflections and difficult to see outside

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.929 
reflections and difficult to see outside
when<00:01:37.140> you're<00:01:37.229> doing<00:01:37.560> special<00:01:38.369> events<00:01:38.759> like

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
when you're doing special events like

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.390 
when you're doing special events like
the<00:01:39.090> Blue<00:01:39.270> Angels<00:01:39.720> air<00:01:39.900> show<00:01:40.140> or<00:01:40.409> any<00:01:40.590> model

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
the Blue Angels air show or any model

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.330 
the Blue Angels air show or any model
airplane<00:01:41.759> flying<00:01:42.090> it's<00:01:42.960> difficult<00:01:43.680> to<00:01:43.979> see

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
airplane flying it's difficult to see

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.730 
airplane flying it's difficult to see
inside<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.570> screen<00:01:45.810> especially<00:01:46.259> if<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.710> have

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
inside the screen especially if you have

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.670 
inside the screen especially if you have
to<00:01:46.979> wear<00:01:47.159> glasses<00:01:47.189> like<00:01:47.909> us<00:01:48.149> old<00:01:48.329> folks<00:01:48.659> do<00:01:48.930> so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
to wear glasses like us old folks do so

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.219 
to wear glasses like us old folks do so
i<00:01:50.070> think<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.939> manufacturers<00:01:51.720> should<00:01:51.750> come<00:01:52.079> up

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
i think the manufacturers should come up

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.040 
i think the manufacturers should come up
with

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
with

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.980 
with
ascent<00:01:53.860> iphones<00:01:54.370> for<00:01:54.580> a<00:01:54.640> camera<00:01:55.150> you<00:01:55.810> could

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
ascent iphones for a camera you could

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.870 
ascent iphones for a camera you could
plug<00:01:56.170> it<00:01:56.320> right<00:01:56.350> into<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> board<00:01:57.190> Virtual

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
plug it right into the board Virtual

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.430 
plug it right into the board Virtual
Reality<00:01:57.910> you<00:01:58.510> got<00:01:58.630> to<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.810> out<00:01:58.870> and<00:01:58.930> do<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.140> scene

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
Reality you got to go out and do a scene

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:18.530 
Reality you got to go out and do a scene
guide<00:01:59.710> can<00:01:59.980> you<00:02:00.070> imagine

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:18.540 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.860 

so<00:02:19.540> you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.810> see<00:02:19.989> I<00:02:20.260> could<00:02:20.440> watch<00:02:20.650> my<00:02:20.980> DVD<00:02:21.870> just

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
so you can see I could watch my DVD just

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:25.500 
so you can see I could watch my DVD just
play<00:02:23.050> plugging<00:02:23.470> into<00:02:23.709> my<00:02:23.950> iphones<00:02:24.459> or<00:02:24.790> i<00:02:25.180> could

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
play plugging into my iphones or i could

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.030 
play plugging into my iphones or i could
plug<00:02:25.840> them<00:02:26.019> into<00:02:26.170> my<00:02:26.379> favorite<00:02:26.800> camera

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
plug them into my favorite camera

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.850 
plug them into my favorite camera
because<00:02:27.940> you<00:02:28.120> know<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.930> reflection<00:02:29.560> on<00:02:29.709> these

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
because you know the reflection on these

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.600 
because you know the reflection on these
