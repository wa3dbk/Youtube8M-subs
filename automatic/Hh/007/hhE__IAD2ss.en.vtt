microphone<00:00:06.890> tutorial<00:00:08.090> this<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.300> where<00:00:10.340> we

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
microphone tutorial this is where we

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.189 
microphone tutorial this is where we
open<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.300> saved<00:00:14.059> wav<00:00:15.059> file<00:00:15.420> that<00:00:15.780> we<00:00:15.929> save

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
open the saved wav file that we save

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.519 
open the saved wav file that we save
from<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.220> last<00:00:17.430> video<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.320> last

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
from the last video and the last

tutorial

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
tutorial

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.710 
tutorial
it's<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.619> save<00:00:22.890> if<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.939> go<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.240> bandicam

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
it's the save if you go into bandicam

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.269 
it's the save if you go into bandicam
and<00:00:25.140> you<00:00:25.650> find<00:00:26.039> sound<00:00:26.930> settings<00:00:28.130> you<00:00:29.130> will

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
and you find sound settings you will

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.460 
and you find sound settings you will
find<00:00:29.519> the<00:00:29.699> save<00:00:30.060> audio<00:00:30.840> tracks<00:00:31.230> while

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
find the save audio tracks while

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250 
find the save audio tracks while
recording<00:00:31.890> as<00:00:32.600> dot<00:00:33.600> wave

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
recording as dot wave

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:42.700 
recording as dot wave
so<00:00:34.969> you<00:00:35.969> file<00:00:36.829> open<00:00:38.960> go<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> file<00:00:40.559> open

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
so you file open go to the file open

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.549 
so you file open go to the file open
there<00:00:43.710> it<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.160> bandicam<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.960> saved<00:00:46.350> the

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
there it is in bandicam and I saved the

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.040 
there it is in bandicam and I saved the
wave<00:00:47.750> there<00:00:48.750> which<00:00:49.140> I've<00:00:49.320> just<00:00:49.350> opened<00:00:51.050> so

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
wave there which I've just opened so

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.119 
wave there which I've just opened so
here<00:00:52.920> we<00:00:53.070> are<00:00:53.100> we've<00:00:53.460> got<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.699> waves<00:00:54.059> now<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
here we are we've got the waves now and

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.959 
here we are we've got the waves now and
we<00:00:56.129> want<00:00:56.370> to<00:00:56.489> get<00:00:56.699> rid<00:00:56.910> of<00:00:57.469> the<00:00:58.469> fur<00:01:00.770> the<00:01:01.969> noise

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
we want to get rid of the fur the noise

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:11.410 
we want to get rid of the fur the noise
now<00:01:06.380> what<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.560> do<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.830> if<00:01:08.610> we<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.390> in<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.600> fix

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
now what we do is if we go in to fix

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.469 
now what we do is if we go in to fix
noise<00:01:12.420> removal<00:01:14.270> now<00:01:15.270> get<00:01:15.659> noise<00:01:15.990> profile<00:01:17.479> not

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
noise removal now get noise profile not

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.320 
noise removal now get noise profile not
of<00:01:18.659> all<00:01:18.810> that<00:01:19.080> how<00:01:19.320> it<00:01:19.439> just<00:01:19.619> got<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.330> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
of all that how it just got it all you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.480 
of all that how it just got it all you
just<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.960> where<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.320> noise<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.950> a

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
just want it where the noise of a

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
just want it where the noise of a
computer<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.270> it'd<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.259> better<00:01:25.439> if<00:01:25.590> you'd<00:01:25.860> left

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
computer is it'd be better if you'd left

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.520 
computer is it'd be better if you'd left
a<00:01:26.220> few<00:01:26.430> seconds<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.540> I<00:01:27.840> should<00:01:28.290> be<00:01:28.320> able<00:01:28.439> to

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
a few seconds but I should be able to

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.899 
a few seconds but I should be able to
grab<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.770> there<00:01:29.479> affects<00:01:30.619> noise<00:01:31.619> removal<00:01:32.340> get

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
grab it there affects noise removal get

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.539 
grab it there affects noise removal get
news<00:01:33.180> noise<00:01:33.560> profile<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:34.770> I've<00:01:34.890> got<00:01:35.100> it<00:01:35.280> where

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
news noise profile so I've got it where

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.649 
news noise profile so I've got it where
the<00:01:36.000> noise<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.479> there<00:01:37.220> so<00:01:38.220> for<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.180> first<00:01:39.329> 5

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
the noise is there so for the first 5

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.719 
the noise is there so for the first 5
seconds<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.560> could<00:01:41.159> leave

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
seconds you could leave

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.760 
seconds you could leave
don't<00:01:42.360> speak<00:01:42.689> at<00:01:42.840> all<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.350> then<00:01:43.530> you'll<00:01:43.680> be

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
don't speak at all and then you'll be

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
don't speak at all and then you'll be
able<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.979> grab<00:01:44.520> it<00:01:44.549> easier<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.299> I've<00:01:45.420> just

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
able to grab it easier but I've just

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.050 
able to grab it easier but I've just
grabbed<00:01:45.840> us<00:01:46.049> about<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.290> second<00:01:46.770> there<00:01:47.930> then

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
grabbed us about a second there then

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.550 
grabbed us about a second there then
once<00:01:51.060> you've<00:01:51.240> done<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.479> you<00:01:52.110> can<00:01:52.259> double

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
once you've done that you can double

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.800 
once you've done that you can double
click<00:01:52.590> it<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:53.159> effects<00:01:53.990> noise<00:01:55.040> removal<00:01:56.040> and

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
click it and effects noise removal and

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.230 
click it and effects noise removal and
you<00:01:57.810> can<00:01:58.049> change<00:01:58.469> it<00:01:58.680> from<00:01:58.829> 0<00:01:59.280> all<00:01:59.880> the<00:02:00.090> way<00:02:00.119> up

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
you can change it from 0 all the way up

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.679 
you can change it from 0 all the way up
to<00:02:00.479> 48<00:02:01.079> if<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.500> had<00:02:01.619> 48<00:02:02.100> noise<00:02:02.850> reduction

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689

now and actually before we do that let's

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.550 
now and actually before we do that let's
listen<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.580> it<00:02:41.610> before<00:02:41.910> we<00:02:42.540> remove<00:02:42.900> it<00:02:44.000> so

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
listen to it before we remove it so

that's important that would have made

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.550 
that's important that would have made
little<00:04:23.789> bit<00:04:24.120> of<00:04:24.240> noise<00:04:24.390> before<00:04:24.720> and<00:04:25.229> I've<00:04:25.380> got

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
little bit of noise before and I've got

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.850 
little bit of noise before and I've got
the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
the

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:29.170

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:29.180 
so as you can see that bit there are

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.809
