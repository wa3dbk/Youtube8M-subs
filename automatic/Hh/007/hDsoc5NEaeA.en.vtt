00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
about where it keeps up to date where he

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.400 
about where it keeps up to date where he
spawned<00:02:12.030> and<00:02:12.180> where<00:02:12.300> he<00:02:12.390> hasn't<00:02:12.750> but<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.260> way

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
spawned and where he hasn't but the way

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.150 
spawned and where he hasn't but the way
that<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.739> get<00:02:13.980> in

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
that you get in

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.860 
that you get in
to<00:02:14.280> a<00:02:14.310> group<00:02:14.670> for<00:02:14.880> him<00:02:15.060> is<00:02:15.210> you<00:02:15.300> just<00:02:15.480> go<00:02:15.630> into

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
to a group for him is you just go into

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.080 
to a group for him is you just go into
the<00:02:15.990> pre-made<00:02:16.350> group<00:02:16.560> finder<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.100> go<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.700> find

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the pre-made group finder and go to find

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.300 
the pre-made group finder and go to find
a<00:02:18.240> group<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.660> then<00:02:19.230> you<00:02:19.500> can<00:02:19.680> see<00:02:19.950> that

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
a group and then you can see that

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.230 
a group and then you can see that
there's<00:02:20.520> tons<00:02:20.820> of<00:02:20.970> pound<00:02:21.270> fish<00:02:21.540> stuff<00:02:21.900> and

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:23.240 
there's tons of pound fish stuff and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.970 
there's tons of pound fish stuff and
well<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:24.480> were<00:02:24.600> more<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.650> tend<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.890> be

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
well there were more there tend to be

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.550 
well there were more there tend to be
more<00:02:26.160> during<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.490> night<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:27.750> just<00:02:28.320> go

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
more during the night and so you just go

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.830 
more during the night and so you just go
and<00:02:28.770> find<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:29.310> pound<00:02:29.580> fist<00:02:29.850> one<00:02:30.120> it'll<00:02:30.690> usually

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
and find a pound fist one it'll usually

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.930 
and find a pound fist one it'll usually
tell<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.410> like<00:02:31.590> how<00:02:31.620> many<00:02:32.070> hours<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.700> been

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
tell you like how many hours it's been

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.830 
tell you like how many hours it's been
since<00:02:33.950> since<00:02:34.950> he<00:02:35.220> could<00:02:36.000> have<00:02:36.120> spawned<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:36.690> how

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
since since he could have spawned so how

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.480 
since since he could have spawned so how
long<00:02:37.050> it's<00:02:37.230> been<00:02:37.290> waiting<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:38.220> higher<00:02:38.460> the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
long it's been waiting the higher the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.570 
long it's been waiting the higher the
number<00:02:39.030> in<00:02:39.510> general<00:02:40.320> the<00:02:40.500> higher<00:02:40.890> probability

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
number in general the higher probability

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.140 
number in general the higher probability
he'll<00:02:41.730> spawn<00:02:42.030> soon<00:02:42.480> so<00:02:43.200> just<00:02:43.890> go<00:02:44.610> and<00:02:44.790> find<00:02:45.030> a

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
he'll spawn soon so just go and find a

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.290 
he'll spawn soon so just go and find a
group<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.510> then<00:02:45.630> just<00:02:45.870> sit<00:02:46.170> in<00:02:46.320> it<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:47.300> find

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
group and then just sit in it and find

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.890 
group and then just sit in it and find
one<00:02:48.630> of<00:02:48.660> those<00:02:48.900> spawn<00:02:49.620> points<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.450> recommend<00:02:51.450> if

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
one of those spawn points I recommend if

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.140 
one of those spawn points I recommend if
you're<00:02:52.050> going<00:02:52.200> to<00:02:52.260> chill<00:02:52.590> anywhere<00:02:53.130> chill<00:02:54.000> at

you're going to chill anywhere chill at

you're going to chill anywhere chill at
the<00:02:54.240> middle<00:02:54.510> one<00:02:54.660> because<00:02:55.020> there<00:02:55.230> are<00:02:55.350> three

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
the middle one because there are three

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.150 
the middle one because there are three
very<00:02:56.460> close<00:02:56.790> by<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.150> can<00:02:57.480> get<00:02:57.660> to<00:02:57.780> them<00:02:57.930> in

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
very close by you can get to them in

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.640 
very close by you can get to them in
somewhere<00:02:59.160> around<00:02:59.360> 10<00:03:00.360> to<00:03:00.570> 15<00:03:00.960> seconds<00:03:01.470> if

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
somewhere around 10 to 15 seconds if

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.920 
somewhere around 10 to 15 seconds if
you're<00:03:01.800> really<00:03:02.040> fast<00:03:02.490> and<00:03:02.820> have<00:03:03.450> a<00:03:03.480> couple<00:03:03.870> of

you're really fast and have a couple of

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.430 
you're really fast and have a couple of
things<00:03:04.260> like<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.130> yak<00:03:05.490> or<00:03:05.820> like<00:03:06.210> the<00:03:06.510> Goblin

glider<00:03:07.740> getting<00:03:08.730> way<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.060> there<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.510> kind<00:03:09.810> of

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
glider getting way up there is kind of

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.510 
glider getting way up there is kind of
difficult<00:03:10.080> but<00:03:10.620> you'll<00:03:10.740> want<00:03:10.950> to<00:03:11.040> have<00:03:11.220> the

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
difficult but you'll want to have the

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:15.140 
difficult but you'll want to have the
feather<00:03:12.860> avion<00:03:13.860> is<00:03:14.010> feather<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.880> launch

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
feather avion is feather to launch

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.700 
feather avion is feather to launch
yourself<00:03:15.300> in<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> air<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.050> fly<00:03:16.230> over<00:03:16.530> there

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:16.710 
yourself in the air and fly over there

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.170 
yourself in the air and fly over there
that's<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.160> fastest<00:03:17.640> way<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:17.850> then<00:03:18.030> as<00:03:18.150> soon

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
that's the fastest way and then as soon

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.980 
that's the fastest way and then as soon
as<00:03:18.420> you<00:03:18.510> get<00:03:18.630> close<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.170> there<00:03:19.380> or<00:03:19.950> did<00:03:20.990> dispel

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
as you get close to there or did dispel

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:23.960 
as you get close to there or did dispel
or<00:03:22.290> remove<00:03:22.800> the<00:03:23.070> buff<00:03:23.340> that<00:03:23.370> gives<00:03:23.820> you<00:03:23.940> the

or remove the buff that gives you the

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:07.070 
other people the reason that there are

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:10.550 
other people the reason that there are
25<00:04:08.070> there's<00:04:08.310> 26<00:04:08.880> druids<00:04:09.300> in<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.600> group<00:04:10.410> a

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:10.560 
25 there's 26 druids in this group a

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.990 
25 there's 26 druids in this group a
while<00:04:10.739> ago<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.459> reason<00:04:11.670> there's<00:04:11.790> so<00:04:11.910> many

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
while ago the reason there's so many

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
while ago the reason there's so many
druids<00:04:12.270> is<00:04:12.480> that<00:04:12.630> you<00:04:12.750> have<00:04:12.959> druids<00:04:13.380> chain

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
druids is that you have druids chain

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.949 
druids is that you have druids chain
cyclone<00:04:14.550> him<00:04:14.790> so<00:04:15.000> that<00:04:15.150> he<00:04:15.239> can't<00:04:15.510> take<00:04:15.690> damage

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
cyclone him so that he can't take damage

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.750 
cyclone him so that he can't take damage
and<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.350> can<00:04:16.530> wait<00:04:16.739> for<00:04:16.950> everyone<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.430> get

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
and you can wait for everyone to get

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.820 
and you can wait for everyone to get
there<00:04:18.030> so<00:04:18.600> wherever<00:04:18.840> he<00:04:19.109> spawns<00:04:19.440> make<00:04:19.709> sure

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
there so wherever he spawns make sure

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.440 
there so wherever he spawns make sure
you've<00:04:19.980> got<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.160> couple<00:04:20.459> of<00:04:20.669> druids<00:04:21.030> so<00:04:21.180> you<00:04:21.270> can

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
you've got a couple of druids so you can

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.080 
you've got a couple of druids so you can
keep<00:04:21.660> the<00:04:21.810> Cyclones<00:04:22.289> up<00:04:22.500> until<00:04:22.850> everyone<00:04:23.850> in

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
keep the Cyclones up until everyone in

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:25.909 
keep the Cyclones up until everyone in
the<00:04:24.240> raid<00:04:24.419> makes<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.870> there<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.229> ideally

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
the raid makes it there and ideally

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.409 
the raid makes it there and ideally
