every two to three hours and if you're

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:42.130 
every two to three hours and if you're
like<00:00:40.370> playing<00:00:40.699> volleyball<00:00:41.120> or<00:00:41.629> going

swimming you should apply it right after
doing<00:00:44.329> those<00:00:44.600> things<00:00:44.900> too<00:00:45.230> and<00:00:45.589> I<00:00:45.650> feel<00:00:45.830> like

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
doing those things too and I feel like

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.070 
doing those things too and I feel like
there's<00:00:46.100> a<00:00:46.190> huge<00:00:46.460> misconception<00:00:46.640> about<00:00:47.360> SPF

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:48.080 
there's a huge misconception about SPF

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:49.900 
there's a huge misconception about SPF
and<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.220> higher<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.760> better

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
and that like the higher the better

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.259 
and that like the higher the better
which<00:00:50.720> technically<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.410> guess<00:00:51.500> is<00:00:52.010> true<00:00:52.489> but

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:53.269 
which technically I guess is true but

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:56.829 
which technically I guess is true but
SPF<00:00:54.260> 100<00:00:54.980> is<00:00:55.220> not<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:55.730> different<00:00:55.970> from<00:00:56.239> SPF

00:00:56.829 --> 00:00:56.839 
SPF 100 is not that different from SPF

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:00.640 
SPF 100 is not that different from SPF
30<00:00:57.199> SPF<00:00:57.559> 15<00:00:58.190> bucks<00:00:58.460> around<00:00:58.699> 94%<00:00:59.329> of<00:00:59.780> UVB<00:01:00.379> rays

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:00.650 
30 SPF 15 bucks around 94% of UVB rays

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.090 
30 SPF 15 bucks around 94% of UVB rays
and<00:01:01.070> SPF<00:01:01.520> 30<00:01:01.820> bucks<00:01:02.149> around<00:01:02.390> 97%<00:01:03.260> so<00:01:03.890> there's

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
and SPF 30 bucks around 97% so there's

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.830 
and SPF 30 bucks around 97% so there's
only<00:01:04.250> 3%<00:01:05.059> of<00:01:05.890> improvement<00:01:06.890> left<00:01:07.280> past<00:01:07.820> SPF<00:01:08.420> 30

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
only 3% of improvement left past SPF 30

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.680 
only 3% of improvement left past SPF 30
and<00:01:09.310> there's<00:01:10.310> never<00:01:10.580> going<00:01:10.940> to<00:01:11.030> be<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.210> hundred

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:11.690 
and there's never going to be a hundred

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.760 
and there's never going to be a hundred
percent<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.560> basically<00:01:13.490> those<00:01:13.759> SPF<00:01:14.360> of<00:01:14.570> 45<00:01:15.110> 50

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
percent so basically those SPF of 45 50

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.680 
percent so basically those SPF of 45 50
and<00:01:16.039> 100<00:01:16.430> and<00:01:16.550> higher<00:01:16.759> aren't<00:01:17.360> really

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
and 100 and higher aren't really

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.139 
and 100 and higher aren't really
exponentially<00:01:18.590> greater<00:01:18.830> at<00:01:19.160> all<00:01:19.340> and<00:01:19.729> just

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
exponentially greater at all and just

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.969 
exponentially greater at all and just
because<00:01:20.390> the<00:01:20.509> number<00:01:20.780> is<00:01:20.869> super<00:01:21.170> high<00:01:21.320> doesn't

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
because the number is super high doesn't

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.650 
because the number is super high doesn't
mean<00:01:22.130> you<00:01:22.220> don't<00:01:22.340> have<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:22.640> reapply<00:01:22.880> that

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
mean you don't have to reapply that

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.779 
mean you don't have to reapply that
rhymed<00:01:23.990> another<00:01:24.860> thing<00:01:25.100> you<00:01:25.190> want<00:01:25.310> to<00:01:25.429> do<00:01:25.610> if

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.369 
mineral oil can't be absorbed by our
skin<00:02:44.189> so<00:02:44.430> it<00:02:44.579> kind<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.849> just<00:02:44.909> sits<00:02:45.629> on<00:02:45.780> top<00:02:46.049> and
