you're gonna want it to be just like a
little<00:00:22.050> bit<00:00:22.200> longer<00:00:22.470> than<00:00:22.710> her<00:00:22.920> hair<00:00:23.160> because

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
little bit longer than her hair because

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.280 
little bit longer than her hair because
when<00:00:23.730> you<00:00:23.850> braid<00:00:24.030> this<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.420> it'll<00:00:24.690> shrink<00:00:24.930> up<00:00:25.140> a

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
when you braid this in it'll shrink up a

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.090 
when you braid this in it'll shrink up a
little<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:26.220> so<00:00:26.940> to<00:00:27.000> find<00:00:27.540> the<00:00:27.720> middle<00:00:28.100> you

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
little bit and so to find the middle you

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.740 
little bit and so to find the middle you
can<00:00:29.130> just<00:00:29.430> fold<00:00:29.700> it<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.000> half

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
can just fold it in half

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.160 
can just fold it in half
and<00:00:31.309> then<00:00:32.309> where<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> fold<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.540> that's<00:00:33.960> going

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
and then where the fold is that's going

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.869 
and then where the fold is that's going
to<00:00:34.350> be<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> middle<00:00:34.770> you<00:00:35.340> can<00:00:35.489> just<00:00:35.640> place<00:00:35.850> it

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
to be the middle you can just place it

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.870 
to be the middle you can just place it
over<00:00:36.180> her<00:00:36.480> head<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:36.990> what<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.160> I've<00:00:38.370> done<00:00:38.640> is

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:38.880 
over her head and what all I've done is

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:40.819 
over her head and what all I've done is
just<00:00:38.910> parted<00:00:39.450> her<00:00:39.570> hair<00:00:39.600> down<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.320> middle<00:00:40.500> and

just parted her hair down the middle and
I<00:00:41.010> just<00:00:41.250> let<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.490> air<00:00:41.820> dry<00:00:41.850> because<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.780> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
I just let it air dry because this is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
I just let it air dry because this is
supposed<00:00:43.650> to<00:00:43.739> be<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.920> natural<00:00:44.400> look<00:00:44.610> her<00:00:44.880> hair
