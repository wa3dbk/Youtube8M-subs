think you guys would care about of

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.830 
think you guys would care about of
course<00:00:59.860> be<00:01:00.010> covering<00:01:00.400> that<00:01:00.670> but<00:01:01.030> I<00:01:01.060> really

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
course be covering that but I really

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.200 
course be covering that but I really
want<00:01:02.079> to<00:01:02.140> get<00:01:02.230> back<00:01:02.290> and<00:01:02.620> drew<00:01:02.829> zombies<00:01:03.310> it's

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
want to get back and drew zombies it's

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.700 
want to get back and drew zombies it's
been<00:01:04.390> a<00:01:04.420> while<00:01:04.689> since<00:01:05.019> I<00:01:05.199> started<00:01:05.470> playing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
been a while since I started playing

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:07.710 
been a while since I started playing
zombies<00:01:06.280> and<00:01:06.520> I<00:01:06.579> think<00:01:06.939> the<00:01:07.060> best<00:01:07.240> way<00:01:07.329> to<00:01:07.450> do

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
zombies and I think the best way to do

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.929 
zombies and I think the best way to do
that<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:08.079> to<00:01:08.350> jump<00:01:08.740> back<00:01:08.979> into<00:01:09.189> some<00:01:09.430> custom

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:09.939 
that is to jump back into some custom

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:10.980 
that is to jump back into some custom
zombies<00:01:10.270> now<00:01:10.390> I<00:01:10.420> was<00:01:10.509> doing<00:01:10.720> that<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.869> little

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
zombies now I was doing that a little

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.569 
zombies now I was doing that a little
bit<00:01:11.140> before<00:01:11.320> advanced<00:01:11.979> warfare<00:01:12.340> and<00:01:12.520> the

00:01:12.569 --> 00:01:12.579 
bit before advanced warfare and the

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.539 
bit before advanced warfare and the
advanced<00:01:13.270> warfare<00:01:13.630> hype<00:01:13.840> train<00:01:14.079> began<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
advanced warfare hype train began and

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.830 
advanced warfare hype train began and
I'd<00:01:15.640> like<00:01:15.789> to<00:01:15.939> get<00:01:16.030> back<00:01:16.210> into<00:01:16.479> that<00:01:16.569> so<00:01:16.810> I
