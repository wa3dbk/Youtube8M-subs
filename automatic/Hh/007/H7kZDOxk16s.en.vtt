00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:13.100
 this we must learn to download music 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:14.510
 cb or to an mp3 that we have for it what 

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.490
 what are we going to need is this a 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.670
 program called a to be kutcher let's 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.900
 download music from the internet and from 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:22.070
 sure way I recommend that 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.590
 program because it is one of the most 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.270
 sure that I could find 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.640
 the link of the download of this program 

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.930
 just in case another one leave the video down 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.670
 in the direction of the video I'll let you 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.950
 the link to download this 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.450
 program and once you have it 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.270
 already installed on your desktop 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.940
 and what we have to do is what 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.620
 next let's give it right click 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.489
 we execute as administrator we are in 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:48.650
 windows 7 and we see that if we wait for a 

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.090
 moment you open the program once 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:52.940
 opens the program of the latest version of 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.949
 location to download music I have 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:56.030
 what to click on says music what 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.600
 we will make a moment that the 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.190
 window we close this and once we 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.649
 this window opens what I have to 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.750
 to do is put here the title of the 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.880
 song and followed by the artist's name 

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.080
 or the other way around so we can find the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.210
 songs of the song that we want 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.430
 fine if you want the songs of a 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.880
 specific group for example a group 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.200
 musical and if you know the album exactly 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.210
 you put it on and exactly cover those 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.950
 songs then I'm going to put a 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.950
 song and its respective singer 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:45.790
 [Music] 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:49.920
 and once once we have him 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.920
 written we have to where to look for mp3 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.840
 and as they see they immediately declare 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.789
 different versions of this song already 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.140
 are given in some are live 

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:00.140
 others are in studies 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.380
 and you what have to be fixed here 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.510
 is the song that is in the wrong has 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.640
 higher score in this case the 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.340
 first and where you have more searches 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.900
 rather rather more more fans of 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.250
 this qualifies higher rating when 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.100
 has a higher rating that indicates that 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.510
 the audio is of better quality and also 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.120
 in the duration they extend the duration 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.620
 maximum duration of the five 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.450
 stars and have the maximum 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.290
 duration in this case would be the first 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.290
 you must click there 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:36.230
 and 9 that if you want to transfer me 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.870
 downloading you can go listening to the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.329
 pause so there's no Europe that I'm 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.189
 recording once it has been labeled 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:45.409
 here you have two options to download 

00:02:43.189 --> 00:02:47.689
 life right click and no turn band or 

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:50.209
 well here is where it says download 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:52.640
 select one click here we hope you will 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.409
 open the other window very well once 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.939
 that we are here where vitra te says 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:58.099
 let's take the maximum speed of 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:03:00.799
 download that is 320 kb 

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.569
 and here with these three but it says if you're 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.579
 testing three-point discs we have 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.680
 than to look for the place where our 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.620
 usb in this case is also seen in the 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.700
 team and I'll look at the units in 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.700
 this case my partitions 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.770
 in the divide unit and here is my 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:23.220
 usb that has the name of windows xp 

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.910
 with that name is because I did you 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:28.710
 use this usb to make a cultural 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.780
 how to install windows windows xp a 

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:32.580
 from a usb memory and that's why 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:35.160
 it was with that name then it 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.080
 selected and I give in accept once 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.090
 that was already selected is going to see 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.120
 only the number forgive the letter of 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.130
 the one that assigned windows usb in this 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.340
 cf case and once everything is already 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:48.540
 configurable we click on save 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:50.790
 Immediately Caribbean says downloading 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.200
 we're going to say half downloads and here 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.750
 we can see the progress of the download 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.940
 once when it reaches 100% it means 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.440
 that our YouTube will be

 you want to study in other versions 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.620
