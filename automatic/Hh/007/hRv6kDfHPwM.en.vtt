it<00:01:02.899> is<00:01:04.660> let's<00:01:05.660> take<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.899> quick<00:01:06.380> look<00:01:06.740> at

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
it is let's take a quick look at

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:10.240 
it is let's take a quick look at
pictures<00:01:08.350> this<00:01:09.350> functionality<00:01:09.799> is<00:01:10.040> similar

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
pictures this functionality is similar

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:11.950 
pictures this functionality is similar
to<00:01:10.520> what<00:01:10.640> you've<00:01:10.760> seen<00:01:10.939> on<00:01:11.119> June's<00:01:11.420> before<00:01:11.840> but

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
to what you've seen on June's before but

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.670 
to what you've seen on June's before but
we<00:01:12.020> just<00:01:12.170> want<00:01:12.320> to<00:01:12.380> show<00:01:12.500> you<00:01:12.590> the

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:12.680 
we just want to show you the

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.830 
we just want to show you the
accelerometer<00:01:13.430> and<00:01:13.460> how<00:01:13.640> quick<00:01:13.909> it<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:14.600> to

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:14.840 
accelerometer and how quick it is to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.179 
accelerometer and how quick it is to
rotate<00:01:16.360> likewise<00:01:17.360> you<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.409> pinch<00:01:18.710> zoom<00:01:18.950> just

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:19.189 
rotate likewise you can pinch zoom just

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:22.719 
rotate likewise you can pinch zoom just
like<00:01:19.310> the<00:01:19.520> iPhone<00:01:20.590> it's<00:01:21.590> very<00:01:21.920> fast<00:01:22.310> very

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
like the iPhone it's very fast very

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.249 
like the iPhone it's very fast very
fluid<00:01:23.180> really<00:01:23.509> easy<00:01:23.659> to<00:01:23.840> control<00:01:24.110> this

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
fluid really easy to control this

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.899

probably<00:01:24.770> the<00:01:24.830> best<00:01:25.070> pinch<00:01:25.430> zoom<00:01:25.610> we've<00:01:25.729> ever

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:25.909 
probably the best pinch zoom we've ever

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.330 
probably the best pinch zoom we've ever
seen<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:27.200> certainly<00:01:27.470> helps<00:01:27.710> that<00:01:27.799> this<00:01:27.950> has<00:01:28.130> in

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
seen it certainly helps that this has in

let's<00:04:21.680> compare<00:04:22.010> this<00:04:22.250> in<00:04:22.430> size<00:04:22.700> to<00:04:23.000> the<00:04:23.120> iPhone

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:23.510 
let's compare this in size to the iPhone

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:32.480 
let's compare this in size to the iPhone
4

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.460 

you<00:04:33.490> can<00:04:33.639> see<00:04:33.880> it's<00:04:34.540> quite<00:04:34.780> a<00:04:34.900> bit<00:04:35.020> smaller

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:35.470 
you can see it's quite a bit smaller

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:36.720 
you can see it's quite a bit smaller
than<00:04:35.620> the<00:04:35.770> iPhone<00:04:36.160> now<00:04:36.280> obviously<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
than the iPhone now obviously the

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:38.520 
than the iPhone now obviously the
iPhones<00:04:37.060> thicker<00:04:37.330> than<00:04:37.570> the<00:04:37.660> iPod<00:04:38.020> Touch<00:04:38.260> but

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.530 
iPhones thicker than the iPod Touch but

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:40.409 
iPhones thicker than the iPod Touch but
you<00:04:38.620> get<00:04:38.740> an<00:04:38.800> idea<00:04:39.040> that<00:04:39.250> the<00:04:39.730> zoom<00:04:39.910> is<00:04:40.090> about

00:04:40.409 --> 00:04:40.419 
you get an idea that the zoom is about

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:42.600 
you get an idea that the zoom is about
the<00:04:40.630> same<00:04:40.840> thickness<00:04:41.560> as<00:04:41.919> the<00:04:41.950> iPod<00:04:42.400> Touch

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
the same thickness as the iPod Touch

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.280 
the same thickness as the iPod Touch
it's<00:04:42.850> just<00:04:43.000> a<00:04:43.090> teeny<00:04:43.389> bit<00:04:43.510> thicker<00:04:43.960> and<00:04:44.139> it's

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:44.290 
it's just a teeny bit thicker and it's

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:46.800 
it's just a teeny bit thicker and it's
at<00:04:44.470> this<00:04:44.560> point<00:04:45.090> so<00:04:46.090> it's<00:04:46.210> a<00:04:46.240> pretty<00:04:46.450> teeny

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
at this point so it's a pretty teeny

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:50.490 
at this point so it's a pretty teeny
device<00:04:47.200> that's<00:04:47.500> very<00:04:47.680> powerful<00:04:49.230> I'll<00:04:50.230> take<00:04:50.380> it

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
device that's very powerful I'll take it

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.590 
device that's very powerful I'll take it

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
first we'll take a look at those in demo

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.350 
first we'll take a look at those in demo

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:37.180 
hope we can capture that on camera you
really<00:05:36.319> have<00:05:36.410> to<00:05:36.470> see<00:05:36.620> it<00:05:36.710> in<00:05:36.770> person<00:05:36.919> to

really have to see it in person to

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:38.249 
really have to see it in person to
believe<00:05:37.340> it

00:05:38.249 --> 00:05:38.259 
believe it

00:05:38.259 --> 00:05:40.689 
believe it
there<00:05:39.259> is<00:05:39.380> no<00:05:39.530> speaker<00:05:40.009> so<00:05:40.250> you're<00:05:40.400> not<00:05:40.520> going

00:05:40.689 --> 00:05:40.699 
there is no speaker so you're not going

00:05:40.699 --> 00:05:41.920 
there is no speaker so you're not going
to<00:05:40.759> hear<00:05:40.940> whatever<00:05:41.120> audio<00:05:41.479> track<00:05:41.750> is

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
associated with your video unless you

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:45.909 
associated with your video unless you
plug<00:05:43.580> in<00:05:43.729> some<00:05:43.910> headphones<00:05:44.090> some<00:05:44.720> speakers<00:05:45.110> or

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
plug in some headphones some speakers or

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.320 
plug in some headphones some speakers or
stream<00:05:46.520> it<00:05:46.639> to<00:05:46.849> your<00:05:47.030> receiver<00:05:48.849> wanna<00:05:49.849> go<00:05:50.060> back

00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:50.330 
stream it to your receiver wanna go back

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:51.790 
stream it to your receiver wanna go back
it's<00:05:50.630> as<00:05:50.780> simple<00:05:50.900> just<00:05:51.289> hitting<00:05:51.500> the<00:05:51.620> back

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:51.800 
it's as simple just hitting the back

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.790 
it's as simple just hitting the back
button<00:05:51.830> it's<00:05:52.250> easy<00:05:52.460> to<00:05:52.610> control<00:05:52.759> the<00:05:52.970> zone

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:56.800 

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.930 

let's<00:05:57.800> take<00:05:57.919> it<00:05:58.069> look<00:05:58.370> at<00:05:58.490> a<00:05:58.550> youtube<00:05:58.940> video<00:05:59.120> so

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
let's take it look at a youtube video so

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:07.439 
let's take it look at a youtube video so
widescreen<00:06:01.940> 16<00:06:02.509> by<00:06:02.720> 9<00:06:02.750> aspect<00:06:02.990> ratio<00:06:03.500> display

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:07.449 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:09.700 

kind<00:06:08.449> of<00:06:08.539> dark<00:06:08.750> seems<00:06:09.020> a<00:06:09.139> little<00:06:09.199> hard<00:06:09.440> to<00:06:09.530> see

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
kind of dark seems a little hard to see

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:15.580 
kind of dark seems a little hard to see
there<00:06:10.069> we<00:06:10.130> go

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:15.590 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:17.920 

so<00:06:16.190> this<00:06:16.370> guy<00:06:16.520> can<00:06:16.730> handle<00:06:16.910> HD<00:06:17.600> video<00:06:17.870> playback

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
so this guy can handle HD video playback

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.780 
so this guy can handle HD video playback
though<00:06:18.590> the<00:06:18.740> resolution<00:06:19.010> is<00:06:20.680> 480<00:06:21.680> by<00:06:21.889> 272<00:06:22.639> so

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
though the resolution is 480 by 272 so

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:24.370 
though the resolution is 480 by 272 so
you<00:06:22.880> won't<00:06:23.060> see<00:06:23.270> HD<00:06:23.660> on<00:06:23.780> the<00:06:23.930> screen<00:06:24.200> that's

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
you won't see HD on the screen that's

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.200 
you won't see HD on the screen that's
