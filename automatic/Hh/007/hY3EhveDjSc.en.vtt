if you have a screen protector on you're
going<00:02:27.989> to<00:02:28.079> want<00:02:28.260> to<00:02:28.349> be<00:02:28.439> a<00:02:28.470> little<00:02:28.620> careful

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
going to want to be a little careful

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.229 
going to want to be a little careful
that<00:02:29.189> you<00:02:29.280> don't<00:02:29.370> lift<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:29.849> up<00:02:29.939> or<00:02:30.180> you're

protector<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.709> afterwards<00:02:32.280> I<00:02:32.810> think<00:02:33.810> that

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
protector on afterwards I think that

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.390 
protector on afterwards I think that
probably<00:02:34.110> will<00:02:34.470> work<00:02:34.680> why<00:02:34.860> we'll<00:02:35.069> know<00:02:35.220> more

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
probably will work why we'll know more

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.250 
probably will work why we'll know more
once<00:02:35.579> I<00:02:35.790> have<00:02:36.060> a<00:02:36.329> couple<00:02:36.989> of<00:02:37.049> screen

you've got an opening for the microphone

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
minutes of immersion and that only works

if<00:03:57.720> this<00:03:58.109> door<00:03:58.409> is<00:03:58.560> properly<00:03:58.979> sealed<00:03:59.370> they<00:03:59.819> had

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
if this door is properly sealed they had

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.909 
if this door is properly sealed they had
to<00:04:00.120> account<00:04:00.359> for<00:04:00.510> it<00:04:00.750> so<00:04:00.900> it's<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.109> fairly<00:04:01.440> large

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
to account for it so it's a fairly large

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:05.149 
to account for it so it's a fairly large
opening<00:04:02.639> with<00:04:02.790> a<00:04:02.819> fairly<00:04:03.329> big<00:04:03.840> run<00:04:04.290> here<00:04:04.620> my

00:04:05.149 --> 00:04:05.159 
opening with a fairly big run here my

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:07.189 
opening with a fairly big run here my
suspicion<00:04:05.729> is<00:04:05.849> that<00:04:05.909> this<00:04:06.269> is<00:04:06.479> the<00:04:06.659> spot<00:04:06.930> on

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
suspicion is that this is the spot on

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:10.039 
suspicion is that this is the spot on
the<00:04:07.319> case<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:07.799> will<00:04:07.919> fail<00:04:08.250> most<00:04:08.609> readily<00:04:09.090> as

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:10.049 
the case that will fail most readily as

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.780 
the case that will fail most readily as
you<00:04:10.319> use<00:04:10.560> it<00:04:10.709> because<00:04:10.859> it<00:04:11.129> is<00:04:11.250> really<00:04:11.519> just<00:04:11.699> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
you use it because it is really just the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.430 
you use it because it is really just the
soft<00:04:12.180> material<00:04:12.780> and<00:04:12.959> it's<00:04:13.079> a<00:04:13.139> fairly

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
soft material and it's a fairly

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.849 
soft material and it's a fairly
expensive<00:04:13.889> stretch<00:04:14.519> of<00:04:14.819> it<00:04:15.659> here<00:04:16.440> on<00:04:16.620> the<00:04:16.709> back
