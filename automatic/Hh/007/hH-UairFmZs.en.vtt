 the riot games studio consisting of two 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.510
 members of the dota community if you 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.580
 ignore it from pack defense of the 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.189
 ancients a mode for warcraft game 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.680

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.800
 was the basis of multiplayer online battle 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.989
 arena otherwise called moba this studio 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.769
 indie then builds a partnership with 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:42.070
 steve fric 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:44.690
 a former designer of the dota dot allstars 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.180
 this mode is an improvement of the famous 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.930
 mod dota riot games related also with 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.239
 steve mason 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.309
 the creator of dota allstars points 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.470
 as the main community site of 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:57.049
 endowed their goal was clear make a 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.580
 spiritual successor to dota this idea 

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:01.190
 dating back to 2005 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.170
 but for that we had to separate from 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.180
 warcraft iii create his own engine of 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:09.080
 game and improve what had already been 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:11.210
 does for the moba genre for creation 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.649
 of the various champion of the game rather than 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.229
 leave design to a small team 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:16.820
 the whole company could have access to 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:19.670
 basic patterns to have fun with 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.710
 then a vote was organized with all 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 the employees the winning designs and is 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.109
 integrated into the game 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:28.219
 it allowed to have creations 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.450
 varied over the years riot games 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.130
 did a lot of April fools 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.890
 about a character of my hours 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.810
 fsa manatee a manatee he did however 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.820
 never been integrated into the game so 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.619
 playable but he's in skins for 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.840
 aiming horn and warwick 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.939
 by the way he was killed by the latter 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.490
 who wear it like a second skin 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.990
 on the arwing map and the ghost of the 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.649
 refusal can appear and attack 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.719
 warwick 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:52.700
 some names of the fictitious skills 

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:55.249
 hard are references to music 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.200
 german boat of lonely island for the 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:58.939
 skill water led splash this is a 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.200
 reference to the cloud break limit 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:02.640
 in final fantasy 7 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.530
 omnis loose 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.270
 it is likely that heels are the 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.880
 killer of the sea ​​of ​​miss fortune 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.380
 indeed according to her background she saw 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.780
 his mother in a puddle of blood 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.670
 she then received a blow to the head this 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.350
 which made them fall to the ground and alone 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:19.780
 thing that are remembered are the eyes 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.239
 red killer and his face covered 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.580
 a bandanna of bandits gold skins 

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:26.920
 renegade heels has red eyes and a 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.290
 bandanna bandanna hides his face 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.790
 knowing that he is an assassin looks 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:36.130
 perfectly logical lesinois ramus 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.200
 is very close to bowser the villain of 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.269
 the mario feast series his arms are 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.620
 yellow the picks are Belgian and his 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.090
 shell and green 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:47.620
 no doubt it is a reference 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:48.670
 voluntary the name of mordekaiser can 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:50.830
 be translated from German by 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.570
 the emperor of murder 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:54.640
 so we talk about him his ultimate attack 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.140
 till dawn of the brave in English is 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.940
 definitely a reference to the song 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:02.350
 from the same world famous heavy band 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:04.630
 metal black sabbath the champion chain 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:07.150
 is very close to the hero of the series of 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.799
 shinobi games john woo sachy they have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:10.690
 by the way the same walk animation 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.579
 and two dash france is she any 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.650
 something that is transmitted in ninja one year 

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.870
 passing chain means god in Chinese 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.760
 this said in the Chinese version of the game 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.980
 it's another symbol that used it 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:25.209
 even if he has the same pronunciation he 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:26.530
 mean caution did not know it's very 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.350
 visually close to Egyptian god 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.329
 anubis besides his scepter is very 

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:33.280
 near a bass the scepter of the gods 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.110
 Egyptians as long as there is the joke of 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:39.579
 nasus in English the famous chorus of the 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:41.890
 Song Houlette de Djoutout The Champion 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.760
 udir takes its name from norwegian in 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.739
 this beautiful language 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.810
 his name means stupid as beasts 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.840
 wild a step like idiot by the way 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:52.329
 we danish the words unite and say want the 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.160
 say monsters and animal and u say in 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.690
 this language is used to describe 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:00.130
 the evil people who kill without mercy 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.690
 if you stay with skarner for a 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.230
 some time doing nothing in a 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.420
 bush 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.400
 there is a chance he says skarsgard 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.050
 farmer this is definitely a 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.640
 reference to pokemon knowing that they have 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 tendency to be in herbs 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:15.760
 high and to repeat their name the name of the 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.130
 champion brent is related to languages 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:18.790
 German Danish and Swedish 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:21.280
 Dutch 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.350
 indeed in these languages bran means 

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.270
 fire or something to associate with fire 

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:26.440
 and the character is an avenger 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.800
 flamboyant 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.350
 after all the heimerdinger champion 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.390
 takes its name from a word suitcase between 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.970
 names of two oppenheimer scientists 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:39.220
 and schrödinger the latter is known for 

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:40.930
 his famous Schrödinger cat and has 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:43.540
 advanced on quantum physics 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:46.080
 oppenheimer well he is named the father 

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:48.010
 of the atomic bomb 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.350
 liszt fears that throws sometimes 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:52.360
 exterminate when he attacks both the 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.710
 original version knowing that it is a 

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:55.780
 robot this is definitely a 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.270
 reference to the doctor's enemies and 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:59.620
 of alec in series doctor who of more his 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.120
 story is pretty close to the new 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.830
 the bicentennial man of the magazines of 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.720
 when the champion draven catches the 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.520
 ax of another traven he will be able to say 

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.860
 a special sentence the first is 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.260
 beautiful hb I'm learning it and the second 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:18.070
 young and the named pays you english for 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:20.050
 theft of an object the champion life 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:22.690
 certainly holds his name from Latin in 

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.860
 effect vi means force and life wants 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:25.930
 say with force 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.970
 it's also number 6 in numbers 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.650
 romans of the shot number of players getting 

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.390
 are racking their brains to find 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.100
 links for example this name is maybe 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.980
 in connection with his relationship with caitlin 

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:37.720
 and wii was his partner so his 6 

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:39.669
 like the doubs in the investments 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.740
 military this could also have a 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.720
 report with the 6th American amendment 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.700
 concerning criminal proceedings on 

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.890
 figure 6 can be seen on the chest 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.120
 of the character and on the badge of his 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.550
 police cap in saskin 

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.470
 officers life to finish she has according 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.460
 his background is part of a gang at 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:56.460
 6 years old 

00:05:56.569 --> 00:06:00.889
 there is this king's series getting done 

00:05:58.279 --> 00:06:02.809
 reference to internet browsers at

 in the mode all random olomide ahram 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:19.759
 for the close friends 

00:06:17.689 --> 00:06:21.979
 if a player decides to feed a port o 

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:24.169
 of 10 for aussenac this it will explode in 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:26.419
 plenty of small for 8 to be precise 

00:06:24.169 --> 00:06:28.369
 and if brome feeds a port or in 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:30.529
 the screaming abyme that will give him a 

00:06:28.369 --> 00:06:32.209
 mustache as brome stage the 

00:06:30.529 --> 00:06:34.249
 color will depend on the skin of the character 

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:36.050
 hold on as long as I mention these creatures 

00:06:34.249 --> 00:06:38.149
 let's talk a bit about their origin 

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:40.639
 the team is looking to make the map of 

00:06:38.149 --> 00:06:42.080
 the screaming abyme a little less dark they 

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:44.059
 were inspired by animals 

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:46.069
 polar bears like the polar bears 

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:48.199
 mountain goats or the reins 

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.689
 by the way the name comes from the word 

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:52.729
 Finnish to designate the reins once 

00:06:50.689 --> 00:06:54.949
 the final design obtained he add to it 

00:06:52.729 --> 00:06:56.990
 a huge language because it made them 

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:58.759
 think of a puppy and it only took 

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.449
 eight hours for the creation of these 

00:06:58.759 --> 00:07:03.889
 little creatures before I finish 

00:07:02.449 --> 00:07:06.349

 did not know the universe of lol and that 

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:17.100
 really motivated me to do this episode 

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:18.510
 and I stop here there are still plenty of 

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:20.520
