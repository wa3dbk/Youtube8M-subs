00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.520
 very well let's see how it works 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:08.170
 basically the connection in an alarm 

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.820
 for automobile 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:14.830
 we will always have a red wire in 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.599
 most alarms a red wire 

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.939
 which is the main power and 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.189
 that connects to a voltage source 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:23.140
 of constant inside the car and 

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.420
 we have a black cable that connects 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.530
 generally to ground that we have indicated 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.080
 for this symbol 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:34.430
 and the other wires in the alarm are 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.880
 divide into two groups groups of exit and 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:39.060
 the entry group 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.440
 in the case of pulse outputs 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.960
 we have to each of these cables 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.020
 they carry activation pulses that can 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.760
 be negative or positive and that are 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.820
 cables that connect to the circuits 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.340
 of the car that are responsible for activating 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.490
 things in it like safe glass 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.040
 electric scajola 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.860
 and that they require or not depending on the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.250
 automobile the use of relays 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.730
 associated resistances in the case of 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.170
 input cables we have that are cables 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.110
 that are going to connect to the circuits 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.810
 of the car and that are intended to collect 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.240
 information on the state in which 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.820
 find the vehicle that is if they are 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.940
 the doors closed or open if you are 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.250
 the ignition switch of the engine is in 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.150
 the position on or if it is in the position 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.900
 off are cables that is to say they carry the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.150
 information from the car to the alarm 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:38.390
 and the same as in the case of departures 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.640
 of pulses the input cables can 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.650
 or not require the use of relays 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.590
 between the circuit of the car and the circuit 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.070
 of the alarm may require resistor is 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.370
 or diodes 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:52.380
 This is why it is very important to know each 

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.760
 vehicle and get the most information 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.560
 possible from the car manufacturer for 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:01.460
 so speed up our installation and 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.460
 avoid errors
