00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:13.890 
that much just in case they got hurt I
don't<00:03:12.880> know<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.180> can<00:03:13.269> see<00:03:13.450> this<00:03:13.570> but<00:03:13.840> I

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
don't know if you can see this but I

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.220 
don't know if you can see this but I
have<00:03:14.140> a<00:03:14.320> grid<00:03:14.910> which<00:03:15.910> is<00:03:16.630> what<00:03:16.870> these<00:03:17.019> things

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
have a grid which is what these things

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.340 
have a grid which is what these things
are<00:03:17.410> called<00:03:17.650> I<00:03:17.950> put<00:03:18.700> it<00:03:18.820> slanted<00:03:19.660> like<00:03:20.110> this

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:20.350 
are called I put it slanted like this

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:23.340 
are called I put it slanted like this
because<00:03:20.890> oh<00:03:21.220> if<00:03:22.060> I<00:03:22.150> want<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.390> put<00:03:22.510> it<00:03:22.600> straight

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
because oh if I want to put it straight

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.340 
because oh if I want to put it straight
it<00:03:23.470> would<00:03:24.250> have<00:03:24.370> hung<00:03:25.300> over<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.720> little<00:03:25.930> bit<00:03:26.140> and

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
it would have hung over a little bit and

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.020 
it would have hung over a little bit and
then<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.739> would<00:03:26.890> have<00:03:26.950> been<00:03:27.100> a<00:03:27.130> gap<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:27.820> and

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
then it would have been a gap here and

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.540 
then it would have been a gap here and
then<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.900> could<00:03:29.050> have<00:03:29.110> jumped<00:03:29.290> it<00:03:29.500> so<00:03:30.280> I<00:03:30.310> put<00:03:30.370> it

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
then I could have jumped it so I put it

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:35.970 
then I could have jumped it so I put it
sideways<00:03:30.820> so<00:03:31.500> not<00:03:32.580> actually<00:03:33.580> a<00:03:33.630> tri<00:03:34.980> rectangle

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:35.980 
sideways so not actually a tri rectangle

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:37.830 
sideways so not actually a tri rectangle
it's<00:03:36.130> actually<00:03:36.640> go

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
it's actually go

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.380 
it's actually go
weird<00:03:38.410> shape<00:03:39.540> anyway<00:03:40.540> um<00:03:42.060> yeah<00:03:43.060> they<00:03:43.240> really

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:43.390

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
like it so the ramp goes from the second
