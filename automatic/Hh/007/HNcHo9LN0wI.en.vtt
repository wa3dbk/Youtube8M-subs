yeah<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.870> what<00:00:40.200> fig<00:00:40.440> tree<00:00:40.740> it's<00:00:41.010> a<00:00:41.130> fig<00:00:41.310> tree

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
yeah and what fig tree it's a fig tree

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.280 
yeah and what fig tree it's a fig tree
it's<00:00:41.610> quite<00:00:41.760> hard<00:00:42.000> to<00:00:42.120> guess<00:00:42.330> and<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.050> man

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290

it's quite hard to guess and a man
planted<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:44.160> fig<00:00:44.400> tree<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.910> his<00:00:45.120> guard<00:00:45.390> so<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
planted a fig tree in his guard so the

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.230 
planted a fig tree in his guard so the
man<00:00:45.990> comes<00:00:46.320> along<00:00:46.650> after<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.550> while<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.150> he

man comes along after a while and he
wants<00:00:48.480> to<00:00:48.630> see<00:00:48.810> how<00:00:49.020> his<00:00:49.170> fig<00:00:49.470> tree<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.830> getting

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:50.130 
wants to see how his fig tree is getting

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.520 
wants to see how his fig tree is getting
along<00:00:50.340> now<00:00:50.910> when<00:00:51.180> leaves<00:00:51.510> start<00:00:51.930> to<00:00:52.080> appear<00:00:52.410> on

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
along now when leaves start to appear on

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.010 
along now when leaves start to appear on
a<00:00:52.560> fig<00:00:52.830> tree<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.580> the<00:00:53.850> time<00:00:54.120> that<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.870> get

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
a fig tree that's the time that you get

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.230 
a fig tree that's the time that you get
excited<00:00:55.560> because<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.980> think<00:00:56.160> maybe<00:00:56.700> the<00:00:57.000> figs

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
excited because you think maybe the figs

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.360 
excited because you think maybe the figs
are<00:00:57.630> gonna<00:00:57.810> start<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.350> appear<00:00:58.710> as<00:00:58.860> well<00:00:59.040> so<00:00:59.280> he

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
are gonna start to appear as well so he

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.000 
are gonna start to appear as well so he
comes<00:00:59.610> along<00:00:59.880> to<00:01:00.330> look<00:01:00.510> at<00:01:00.600> his<00:01:00.750> tree<00:01:01.080> and<00:01:01.290> then

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
comes along to look at his tree and then

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.680 
comes along to look at his tree and then
something<00:01:02.580> happens<00:01:02.910> look<00:01:03.060> at<00:01:03.150> that<00:01:03.330> what's<00:01:03.570> on

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
something happens look at that what's on

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.319 
something happens look at that what's on
his<00:01:03.810> tree<00:01:04.049> now<00:01:04.369> leaves<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.729> he<00:01:05.790> thinks<00:01:06.090> great

00:01:06.319 --> 00:01:06.329 
his tree now leaves and he thinks great

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.480 
his tree now leaves and he thinks great
the<00:01:06.509> leaves<00:01:06.720> are<00:01:06.930> here<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:07.650> must<00:01:07.920> mean<00:01:08.189> that

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
the leaves are here that must mean that

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.429 
the leaves are here that must mean that
the<00:01:09.000> figs<00:01:09.270> are<00:01:09.450> here<00:01:09.659> as<00:01:09.780> well<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.170> he<00:01:10.259> has<00:01:10.409> a

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
the figs are here as well so he has a

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.110 
the figs are here as well so he has a
good<00:01:10.650> look<00:01:10.830> around<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.280> he<00:01:11.370> he<00:01:11.640> lifts<00:01:11.880> some<00:01:12.060> of

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
good look around and he he lifts some of

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.120 
good look around and he he lifts some of
the<00:01:12.300> leaves<00:01:12.510> Nappanee<00:01:13.020> maybe<00:01:13.470> he<00:01:13.650> climbs<00:01:13.950> up

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
the leaves Nappanee maybe he climbs up

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.590 
the leaves Nappanee maybe he climbs up
the<00:01:14.280> tree<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.520> little<00:01:14.580> bit<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:15.000> see<00:01:15.210> how<00:01:15.240> many

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the tree a little bit to see how many

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.020 
the tree a little bit to see how many
figs<00:01:15.900> he's<00:01:16.110> got<00:01:16.350> he<00:01:16.920> realizes<00:01:17.370> that<00:01:17.580> there<00:01:17.909> are

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
figs he's got he realizes that there are

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.720 
figs he's got he realizes that there are
no<00:01:18.240> figs<00:01:18.630> on<00:01:18.900> his<00:01:19.470> tree<00:01:19.800> and<00:01:20.100> so<00:01:20.220> he<00:01:20.340> thinks<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
no figs on his tree and so he thinks to

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.550 
no figs on his tree and so he thinks to
himself<00:01:20.760> well<00:01:21.120> okay<00:01:21.510> maybe<00:01:22.020> I've<00:01:22.320> come<00:01:22.530> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
himself well okay maybe I've come a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.590 
himself well okay maybe I've come a
little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.950> too<00:01:23.159> early<00:01:23.220> maybe<00:01:23.790> I'll<00:01:24.120> wait<00:01:24.330> for

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
little bit too early maybe I'll wait for

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.510 
little bit too early maybe I'll wait for
a<00:01:24.630> while<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.560> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:25.950> later<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.370> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
a while and a little bit later on in a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.090 
a while and a little bit later on in a
few<00:01:26.700> weeks<00:01:26.850> maybe<00:01:27.180> then<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.380> figs<00:01:28.650> will<00:01:28.830> start

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
few weeks maybe then the figs will start

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.770 
few weeks maybe then the figs will start
to<00:01:29.250> appear<00:01:29.550> he<00:01:29.850> comes<00:01:30.120> along<00:01:30.360> a<00:01:30.420> little<00:01:30.600> bit

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
to appear he comes along a little bit

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.870 
to appear he comes along a little bit
later<00:01:30.840> what<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.770> you<00:01:31.860> think<00:01:32.070> now<00:01:32.310> he's<00:01:32.520> started

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
later what do you think now he's started

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.560 
later what do you think now he's started
to<00:01:32.909> appear<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.510> tree<00:01:34.729> figs<00:01:35.729> you<00:01:35.820> think<00:01:36.120> no

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
to appear on the tree figs you think no

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.870 
to appear on the tree figs you think no
what's<00:01:37.229> happened<00:01:37.650> is<00:01:37.860> that<00:01:38.190> all<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:38.670> leaves

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
what's happened is that all the leaves

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.660 
what's happened is that all the leaves
have<00:01:39.780> changed<00:01:40.320> color<00:01:40.620> what<00:01:40.979> time<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.280> year<00:01:41.430> do

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
have changed color what time of year do

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.390 
have changed color what time of year do
you<00:01:41.700> think<00:01:41.760> it<00:01:42.000> might<00:01:42.180> be<00:01:42.210> what<00:01:42.900> do<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.049> think

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
you think it might be what do you think

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.950 
you think it might be what do you think

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
autumn will fall yeah and what happens

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.320 
autumn will fall yeah and what happens
after<00:01:46.440> the<00:01:46.920> leaves<00:01:47.190> turn<00:01:47.549> orange<00:01:47.760> or<00:01:48.090> yellow

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
after the leaves turn orange or yellow

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.719 
after the leaves turn orange or yellow
what<00:01:48.510> happens<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:48.990> they<00:01:49.920> fall<00:01:50.250> down<00:01:50.520> that

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
what happens then they fall down that

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.210 
what happens then they fall down that
laying<00:01:50.940> in<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.119> tree<00:01:51.390> goes<00:01:52.020> back<00:01:52.320> to<00:01:52.860> how<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
laying in the tree goes back to how it

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.820 
laying in the tree goes back to how it
was<00:01:53.400> in<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.299> first<00:01:54.540> place<00:01:54.960> so<00:01:55.409> there<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.710> is

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
was in the first place so there it is

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.520 
was in the first place so there it is
again<00:01:56.240> now<00:01:57.240> I've<00:01:57.360> had<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.630> fruit<00:01:57.900> tree<00:01:58.140> before

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
again now I've had a fruit tree before

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.170 
again now I've had a fruit tree before
when<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.010> lived<00:01:59.250> in<00:01:59.369> England<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.760> had<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.940> fruit

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
when I lived in England I had a fruit

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.399 
when I lived in England I had a fruit
tree<00:02:00.390> when<00:02:00.570> Donna<00:02:00.750> and<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> lived<00:02:01.170> in<00:02:01.260> England

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
tree when Donna and I lived in England

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.130 
tree when Donna and I lived in England
we<00:02:02.040> had<00:02:02.220> apple<00:02:02.549> trees<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:02.790> our<00:02:03.030> garden<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.570> one

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
we had apple trees in our garden and one

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.590 
we had apple trees in our garden and one
year<00:02:04.350> we<00:02:04.500> had<00:02:04.650> no<00:02:04.979> apples<00:02:05.430> whatsoever<00:02:06.030> none<00:02:06.450> at

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
year we had no apples whatsoever none at

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.330 
year we had no apples whatsoever none at
all<00:02:06.750> and<00:02:06.990> maybe<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.530> had<00:02:07.619> two<00:02:07.830> or<00:02:07.979> three<00:02:08.009> and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
all and maybe we had two or three and

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.649 
all and maybe we had two or three and
they<00:02:08.429> were<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:08.640> kind<00:02:08.909> of<00:02:08.970> shriveled<00:02:09.209> up<00:02:09.450> on

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.659 
they were all kind of shriveled up on

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:12.080 
they were all kind of shriveled up on
the<00:02:09.780> tree<00:02:10.019> but<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.560> next<00:02:11.009> year<00:02:11.370> we<00:02:11.670> had<00:02:11.849> so

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
the tree but the next year we had so

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.360 
the tree but the next year we had so
many<00:02:12.239> apples<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.470> ground<00:02:13.739> was<00:02:13.950> covered

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
many apples that the ground was covered

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.130 
many apples that the ground was covered
with<00:02:14.400> apples<00:02:14.880> we<00:02:15.090> had<00:02:15.240> so<00:02:15.450> many<00:02:15.630> apples<00:02:15.840> we

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
with apples we had so many apples we

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.570 
with apples we had so many apples we
couldn't<00:02:16.410> use<00:02:16.560> them<00:02:16.770> ourselves<00:02:16.920> and<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.459> were

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
couldn't use them ourselves and we were

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.559 
couldn't use them ourselves and we were
bagging<00:02:18.060> in<00:02:18.150> the<00:02:18.209> mapping

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
bagging in the mapping

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.300 
bagging in the mapping
big<00:02:18.749> bags<00:02:19.019> and<00:02:19.349> giving<00:02:19.829> them<00:02:19.950> to<00:02:20.040> all<00:02:20.129> our

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
big bags and giving them to all our

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.500 
big bags and giving them to all our
friends<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.700> neighbors<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.239> there<00:02:21.390> was

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
friends and neighbors and there was

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.690 
friends and neighbors and there was
still<00:02:21.749> too<00:02:22.049> many<00:02:22.290> so<00:02:22.980> just<00:02:23.249> because<00:02:23.400> you<00:02:23.670> don't

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
still too many so just because you don't

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.250 
still too many so just because you don't
get<00:02:24.030> fruit<00:02:24.359> one<00:02:24.569> year<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.840> doesn't<00:02:25.109> mean<00:02:25.230> that

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
get fruit one year it doesn't mean that

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.440 
get fruit one year it doesn't mean that
you<00:02:25.530> won't<00:02:25.709> get<00:02:25.950> fruit<00:02:26.249> the<00:02:26.400> next<00:02:26.730> year<00:02:26.909> so<00:02:27.329> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
you won't get fruit the next year so the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.059 
you won't get fruit the next year so the
man<00:02:27.629> comes<00:02:27.900> back<00:02:28.109> again<00:02:28.290> the<00:02:28.530> next<00:02:28.709> year<00:02:28.950> he

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:29.069 
man comes back again the next year he

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:30.920 
man comes back again the next year he
thinks<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.400> himself<00:02:29.459> what<00:02:30.269> will<00:02:30.389> I<00:02:30.480> find<00:02:30.510> this

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
thinks to himself what will I find this

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
thinks to himself what will I find this
year<00:02:31.200> and<00:02:31.680> he<00:02:31.769> comes<00:02:32.010> along<00:02:32.249> and<00:02:32.459> the<00:02:32.849> first

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
year and he comes along and the first

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.399 
year and he comes along and the first
thing<00:02:33.239> he<00:02:33.329> finds<00:02:33.569> is<00:02:33.780> that<00:02:33.810> green<00:02:34.170> leaves

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:34.409 
thing he finds is that green leaves

00:02:34.409 --> 00:02:36.110 
thing he finds is that green leaves
again<00:02:34.769> and<00:02:34.920> he<00:02:34.980> waits<00:02:35.219> again<00:02:35.549> thinking<00:02:35.879> am<00:02:36.000> I

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
again and he waits again thinking am I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.309 
again and he waits again thinking am I
going<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.389> get<00:02:36.510> something<00:02:36.780> better<00:02:37.079> than<00:02:37.290> that

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
going to get something better than that

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.640 
going to get something better than that
but<00:02:38.010> instead<00:02:38.370> autumn<00:02:39.239> comes<00:02:39.480> and<00:02:39.840> nothing

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
but instead autumn comes and nothing

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:42.649 
but instead autumn comes and nothing
happens<00:02:41.069> so<00:02:41.370> that's<00:02:41.849> two<00:02:42.060> years<00:02:42.269> have<00:02:42.480> gone<00:02:42.599> by

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:42.659

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:45.500 
happens so that's two years have gone by
well<00:02:43.469> I<00:02:43.500> had<00:02:43.709> another<00:02:43.950> tree<00:02:44.310> in<00:02:44.669> England<00:02:45.120> when

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
well I had another tree in England when

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.479 
well I had another tree in England when
I<00:02:45.540> lived<00:02:45.810> up<00:02:45.989> there<00:02:46.230> Cambridgeshire<00:02:46.889> and<00:02:47.099> I

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
I lived up there Cambridgeshire and I

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.520 
I lived up there Cambridgeshire and I
had<00:02:47.639> a<00:02:47.669> plum<00:02:47.999> tree<00:02:48.030> and<00:02:48.659> for<00:02:48.840> two<00:02:48.989> years<00:02:49.260> that

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
had a plum tree and for two years that

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.110 
had a plum tree and for two years that
plum<00:02:49.769> tree<00:02:49.980> didn't<00:02:50.249> give<00:02:50.370> me<00:02:50.489> any<00:02:50.609> fruit<00:02:50.939> at

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
plum tree didn't give me any fruit at

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.509 
plum tree didn't give me any fruit at
all<00:02:51.299> but<00:02:52.049> the<00:02:52.169> third<00:02:52.409> year<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.859> plum<00:02:53.099> tree<00:02:53.340> had

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
all but the third year the plum tree had

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.599 
all but the third year the plum tree had
so<00:02:53.819> many<00:02:54.000> plums<00:02:54.450> that<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.590> branches<00:02:56.129> started

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:56.609 
so many plums that the branches started

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.030 
so many plums that the branches started
to<00:02:56.760> break<00:02:57.030> under<00:02:57.750> the<00:02:57.840> weight<00:02:58.079> of<00:02:58.260> the<00:02:58.739> plums

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
to break under the weight of the plums

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.679 
to break under the weight of the plums
and<00:02:59.340> I<00:02:59.400> really<00:02:59.639> liked<00:02:59.819> plums<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.329> was<00:03:00.449> really

00:03:00.679 --> 00:03:00.689 
and I really liked plums I was really

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:01.429 
and I really liked plums I was really
happy<00:03:00.959> about<00:03:00.989> that

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:01.439 
happy about that

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:03.409 
happy about that
and<00:03:01.889> so<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.370> man<00:03:02.519> thinks<00:03:02.819> well<00:03:02.969> maybe<00:03:03.150> the

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:03.419 
and so the man thinks well maybe the

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.179 
and so the man thinks well maybe the
third<00:03:03.599> year<00:03:03.930> will<00:03:04.049> be<00:03:04.139> the<00:03:04.169> year<00:03:04.290> that<00:03:04.769> the

00:03:05.179 --> 00:03:05.189 
third year will be the year that the

00:03:05.189 --> 00:03:07.309 
third year will be the year that the
figs<00:03:05.430> start<00:03:05.760> to<00:03:05.939> grow<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.510> so<00:03:06.810> he<00:03:06.930> comes<00:03:07.169> back

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
figs start to grow and so he comes back

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.379 
figs start to grow and so he comes back
to<00:03:07.500> the<00:03:07.590> tree<00:03:07.829> again<00:03:07.949> he<00:03:08.760> finds<00:03:09.090> the<00:03:09.209> green

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.389 
to the tree again he finds the green

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.720 
to the tree again he finds the green
leaves<00:03:09.659> again<00:03:10.079> but<00:03:10.620> instead<00:03:10.859> of<00:03:11.250> any<00:03:11.370> figs

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
leaves again but instead of any figs
