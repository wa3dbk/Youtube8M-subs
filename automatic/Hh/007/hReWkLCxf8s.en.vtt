00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:05.920
 good day in this case I will explain 

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.080
 the operation of the clutch a 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.420
 cycled increase and we can see in the 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.670
 video here the clutch is shown a 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.680
 automobile but the principle of 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.780
 operation is the same 

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.790
 the clutch of a motorcycle works 

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.130
 as mechanical connection between the motor and 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.990
 the transmission without clutch as the 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.020
 pilots would have to turn off their engines 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:27.970
 in case of making a stop or 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.619
 be at the traffic lights 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.920
 in this way the clutch allows 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:34.450
 change the gear at high speeds 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.820
 use both feet to brake and 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.500
 change and operate the clutch 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.720
 keeping the feet on the ground for 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.940
 keep balance at low 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.250
 speeds in terms of its 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.510
 Tighten with driver tightens 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.149
 the clutch crank 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.340
 Cable activates the mechanism 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.670
 release releasing applied force 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.470
 to the pressure disc by the springs the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.989
 friction clutch discs are 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.809
 they separate and the engine works without its power 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.010
 which is delivered to the rear wheel 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.149
 when the driver releases the crank 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:06.070
 Of the clutch 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:09.190
 the cable activates the mechanism 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.140
 release in the reverse direction the pressure 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.660
 of the spring is reapplied to the disc 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.430
 of pressure and the clutch disks and 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.800
 friction are forced to join 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.979
 connecting the drive halves 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.280
 and running the clutch and completing it 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.290
 with 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.320
 between the engine and the transmission of the 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.540
 motorcycle engine power is seen 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.880
 through the clutch and the transmission 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.130
 towards the rear wheel propelling the 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.700
 motorcycle until the clutch is 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.210
 unhook again 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.430
 as for the parts the clutches 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:44.219
 consist of a set to connect and 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
 disconnect the engine transmission the 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.369
 main parts of the clutch are 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.630
 divided into unit categories of 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.630
 Drive and driven 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.170
 The drive parts include the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.260
 clutch shaft clutch discs 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.090
 which they are connected by teeth 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.710
 on the inside edge of the disk that 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.229
 meshes with the hard channels of the 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.970
 outside the shaft the clutch is 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.330
 connected to the motor sprocket 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.520
 by a chain or strap 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.590
 the sectioned parts are the bell 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.050
 of clutch and friction discs 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.080
 these discs have coatings 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.000
 heat resistant resistors that 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.180
 tighten the surfaces of the discs 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.860
 when you press your fingers together 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:33.320
 of metal that extend from the edge 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.210
 The outside of the discs fit 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.210
 Perfect in the grooves of the bell 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.640
 of the clutch and the bell is attached to 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.650
 shaft enters the transmission discs 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.230
 bending clutch are arranged 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:47.090
 in the alternate order so that each disk 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.220
 inflection touch the clutch discs 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:50.540
 on Both Sides 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.150
 next to the discs are in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.550
 middle of the clutch bell dsg the 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.850
 teeth that mesh in the grooves and 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.220
 the fingers that mesh with the grooves 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:03.260
 the strength needed to join the 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:05.360
 sectioned parts and action before 

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:07.400
 provides either by means of a spring 

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:09.620
 diaphragm or through several small 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.150
 helical springs in this case we see 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.500
 the clutch of a motorcycle called fz16 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.800
 we see that below this set is 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.450
 find the changes and here it 

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.590
 find the four springs that 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:27.880
 contain the plate should be removed to 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.880
 to be able to see a complete block 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.579
 the connection allows the clutch shaft 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:37.640
 operates and the bell transferring the 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:40.620
 power of the engine towards the transmission 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.069
 there we can see that titania the portal 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.069
 disk 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.020
 as for another thing from the manufacturers 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.510
 of clutches for motorcycles is 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:54.150
 They use different configurations to 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.459
 release and activate the clutch 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.260
 these mechanisms release the pressure of 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:01.290
 spring that is applied to the disc 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.010
 pressure allowing these to continue in 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.019
 the same speed of the cogwheel 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.350
 at the same time as the friction discs 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:09.910
 they stop moving 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.320
 the clutch levers 

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.810
 They are usually next 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.610
 left the handlebar and are connected 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.139
 to the release mechanism by a 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.150
 braided metal cable 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.189
 this cable has regulators that 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.659
 allow mechanisms to adjust the 

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.680
 according to the clutch operation 

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:29.340
 preference of motorcyclists 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.340
 Thank you
