00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:20.509 
I'm expecting a switch to some sort of

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:23.410 
I'm expecting a switch to some sort of
wall<00:00:20.779> so<00:00:21.230> I<00:00:21.289> use<00:00:21.619> a<00:00:21.650> trick<00:00:22.339> and<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:23.240> worst

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:23.420 
wall so I use a trick and the worst

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.240 
wall so I use a trick and the worst
thing<00:00:23.630> that<00:00:23.750> could<00:00:23.869> possibly<00:00:23.900> happen<00:00:24.320> happens

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.250 
thing that could possibly happen happens

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.790 
thing that could possibly happen happens
and<00:00:25.519> I<00:00:26.000> gets<00:00:26.269> up<00:00:26.419> in<00:00:26.539> the<00:00:26.570> flame<00:00:26.839> warm<00:00:27.140> and<00:00:27.349> then

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
and I gets up in the flame warm and then

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.099 
and I gets up in the flame warm and then
I<00:00:27.890> switch<00:00:28.130> out<00:00:28.339> and<00:00:28.580> I<00:00:28.699> get<00:00:28.910> crit<00:00:29.330> /<00:00:29.539> suited<00:00:29.900> and

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
I switch out and I get crit / suited and

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.830 
I switch out and I get crit / suited and
I<00:00:30.230> die<00:00:30.289> and<00:00:30.800> basically<00:00:31.609> that<00:00:31.849> crit<00:00:32.240> just<00:00:32.599> set

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:32.840

the tone for the entire match he goes
back<00:00:35.840> to<00:00:35.960> bash<00:00:36.110> it<00:00:36.290> on<00:00:36.410> I<00:00:36.650> sludge<00:00:36.950> bomb<00:00:37.160> because

back to bash it on I sludge bomb because

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.520 
back to bash it on I sludge bomb because
I<00:00:37.520> don't<00:00:37.760> want<00:00:37.820> to<00:00:38.000> activate<00:00:38.390> swallows<00:00:38.870> a<00:00:38.900> guts

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:39.530 
I don't want to activate swallows a guts

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.340 
I don't want to activate swallows a guts
and<00:00:40.280> then<00:00:40.550> I<00:00:40.670> will<00:00:40.910> o<00:00:40.940> wisp<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.510> for<00:00:41.930> some

reason he's holding a lung berry but i

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.900 
reason he's holding a lung berry but i
will<00:00:45.140> aways<00:00:45.350> begin<00:00:45.710> because<00:00:46.160> he's<00:00:46.490> a<00:00:46.520> bastard

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:46.910 
will aways begin because he's a bastard

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:50.080 
will aways begin because he's a bastard
on<00:00:47.240> and<00:00:47.450> can't<00:00:47.840> do<00:00:48.050> anything<00:00:48.290> to<00:00:48.530> me<00:00:48.560> and<00:00:49.220> I

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
on and can't do anything to me and I

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.180 
on and can't do anything to me and I
switch<00:00:50.450> to<00:00:50.480> Toxicroak<00:00:51.170> because<00:00:51.530> all<00:00:51.740> I<00:00:51.770> saw

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:52.190 
switch to Toxicroak because all I saw

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.700 
switch to Toxicroak because all I saw
was<00:00:52.550> Stone<00:00:53.060> Edge<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.600> even<00:00:54.470> if<00:00:54.530> he<00:00:54.560> has

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:54.710 
was Stone Edge and even if he has

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.800 
was Stone Edge and even if he has
earthquake<00:00:55.160> he's<00:00:55.700> burned<00:00:55.970> so<00:00:56.330> i<00:00:56.360> won't<00:00:56.570> do<00:00:56.660> any

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:56.810 
earthquake he's burned so i won't do any

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.740 
earthquake he's burned so i won't do any
damage<00:00:57.020> to<00:00:57.140> me<00:00:57.380> so<00:00:58.220> I<00:00:58.700> swords<00:00:59.240> dance<00:00:59.420> team

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
damage to me so I swords dance team

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.420 
damage to me so I swords dance team
metal<00:00:59.990> bursts<00:01:00.410> and<00:01:00.680> then<00:01:00.860> he<00:01:01.130> goes<00:01:01.280> to

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
metal bursts and then he goes to

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.140 
metal bursts and then he goes to
hitmontop<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:02.180> I<00:01:03.170> use<00:01:03.410> ice<00:01:03.710> punch<00:01:04.159> again<00:01:04.759> just

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
hitmontop and I use ice punch again just

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.580 
hitmontop and I use ice punch again just
generally<00:01:05.720> predicting<00:01:06.080> a<00:01:06.140> switch<00:01:06.380> to

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:06.590 
generally predicting a switch to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.340 
generally predicting a switch to
something<00:01:07.120> but<00:01:08.120> seeing<00:01:08.540> how<00:01:08.690> much<00:01:08.870> that<00:01:09.050> does

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
something but seeing how much that does

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.470 
something but seeing how much that does
I<00:01:09.650> know<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:10.220> cross<00:01:10.640> chop<00:01:10.940> with<00:01:11.120> a<00:01:11.150> swords

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
I know that cross chop with a swords

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.240 
I know that cross chop with a swords
dance<00:01:11.660> will<00:01:12.020> kill<00:01:12.320> him<00:01:12.530> even<00:01:12.980> without<00:01:13.070> that

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
dance will kill him even without that

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.050 
dance will kill him even without that
critical<00:01:13.910> hit<00:01:14.980> so<00:01:15.980> he<00:01:16.220> sends<00:01:16.460> a<00:01:16.550> swallow<00:01:16.790> back

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
critical hit so he sends a swallow back

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.270 
critical hit so he sends a swallow back
in<00:01:17.270> but<00:01:17.540> since<00:01:17.750> I<00:01:17.900> was<00:01:18.080> intimidated<00:01:18.380> I<00:01:18.920> can't

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
in but since I was intimidated I can't

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.370 
in but since I was intimidated I can't
sucker<00:01:19.880> punch<00:01:19.970> it<00:01:20.360> so<00:01:20.600> I<00:01:20.630> have<00:01:20.930> to<00:01:21.140> go<00:01:21.320> to

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
sucker punch it so I have to go to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.580 
sucker punch it so I have to go to
wheezing<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.700> take<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:23.840> hit<00:01:23.990> instead<00:01:24.140> and

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
wheezing to take the hit instead and

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.280 
wheezing to take the hit instead and
then<00:01:24.620> I<00:01:25.159> use<00:01:25.430> will-o-wisp<00:01:25.700> because<00:01:26.480> I<00:01:26.870> expect

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:27.290 
then I use will-o-wisp because I expect

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.970 
then I use will-o-wisp because I expect
to<00:01:27.380> switch<00:01:27.650> and<00:01:27.860> I<00:01:27.890> burn<00:01:28.220> his<00:01:28.550> nidoking<00:01:29.980> so

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
to switch and I burn his nidoking so

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.480 
to switch and I burn his nidoking so
he's<00:01:31.490> so<00:01:31.820> I<00:01:32.180> switched<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.780> cliff<00:01:33.020> able<00:01:33.350> to<00:01:34.280> take

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
he's so I switched to cliff able to take

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.670 
he's so I switched to cliff able to take
the<00:01:34.670> fire<00:01:34.909> blast<00:01:35.240> it<00:01:35.510> doesn't<00:01:35.840> quite<00:01:36.080> do<00:01:36.380> half

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
the fire blast it doesn't quite do half

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.030 
the fire blast it doesn't quite do half
and<00:01:37.040> I<00:01:38.030> see<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.479> burn<00:01:38.780> and<00:01:39.110> life<00:01:39.350> warp<00:01:39.650> damage

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
and I see with burn and life warp damage

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.410 
and I see with burn and life warp damage
his<00:01:40.250> nidoking<00:01:40.670> isn't<00:01:40.880> going<00:01:41.000> to<00:01:41.060> last<00:01:41.210> very

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
his nidoking isn't going to last very

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.200 
his nidoking isn't going to last very
long<00:01:41.659> so<00:01:42.260> I<00:01:42.530> just<00:01:42.770> soft<00:01:43.310> boil<00:01:43.640> while<00:01:44.000> he

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
long so I just soft boil while he

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.710 
long so I just soft boil while he
switches<00:01:44.479> to<00:01:44.890> bash<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:46.130> on<00:01:46.220> again

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
switches to bash it on again

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.880 
switches to bash it on again
and<00:01:48.720> I<00:01:49.320> call<00:01:49.920> mine<00:01:50.930> because<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.260> can't<00:01:52.740> really

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
and I call mine because he can't really

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.890 
and I call mine because he can't really
hurt<00:01:53.100> me<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.490> he<00:01:53.760> metal<00:01:54.030> bursts<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.540> I<00:01:54.630> think

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
hurt me in he metal bursts and I think

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.320

Thunderbolt<00:01:55.380> will<00:01:55.470> kill<00:01:55.680> him<00:01:55.820> but<00:01:56.820> it<00:01:56.910> doesn't

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.330 
Thunderbolt will kill him but it doesn't

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.320 
Thunderbolt will kill him but it doesn't
but<00:01:58.050> he<00:01:58.260> curses<00:01:58.830> instead<00:01:59.280> I<00:01:59.580> guess<00:01:59.880> predicting

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
but he curses instead I guess predicting

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.140 
but he curses instead I guess predicting

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.020 
able to not attack him and the burn does
kill<00:02:03.480> him<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:04.560> now<00:02:04.740> he<00:02:04.800> sends<00:02:05.250> out<00:02:05.370> this<00:02:05.730> thing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
kill him and now he sends out this thing

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:13.150

would it doesn't have leftovers so I

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:47.780 
would it doesn't have leftovers so I
figure<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.500> scarfed<00:02:46.980> so<00:02:47.370> it's<00:02:47.550> either<00:02:47.640> gonna

of course do anything and I send Lapras

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.110 
of course do anything and I send Lapras
in<00:03:12.280> to<00:03:12.550> take<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.760> Fire<00:03:13.060> Blast<00:03:13.440> and<00:03:15.120> he's

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
in to take the Fire Blast and he's

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.240 
in to take the Fire Blast and he's
probably<00:03:16.360> figuring<00:03:16.840> he<00:03:16.959> can<00:03:17.170> outspeed<00:03:17.709> me<00:03:17.950> and

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
probably figuring he can outspeed me and

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.400 
probably figuring he can outspeed me and
Thunderbolt<00:03:18.790> me<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.239> kill<00:03:19.510> me<00:03:19.540> but<00:03:19.959> after<00:03:20.319> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
Thunderbolt me and kill me but after the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.160 
Thunderbolt me and kill me but after the
burn<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:20.950> know<00:03:21.160> that<00:03:21.340> a<00:03:21.610> ice<00:03:22.239> shard<00:03:22.660> will<00:03:22.900> kill

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
burn I know that a ice shard will kill

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.450 
burn I know that a ice shard will kill
him<00:03:23.319> from<00:03:23.560> there

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:27.460 

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:31.780 

so<00:03:28.460> he<00:03:28.760> sends<00:03:29.150> in<00:03:29.420> the<00:03:29.600> Venus<00:03:29.990> or<00:03:30.170> again<00:03:30.620> I<00:03:30.890> got

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
so he sends in the Venus or again I got

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:34.270 
so he sends in the Venus or again I got
it<00:03:31.880> wheezing<00:03:32.200> he<00:03:33.200> energy<00:03:33.740> balls<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.220> time

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:34.280 
it wheezing he energy balls this time

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.010 
it wheezing he energy balls this time
and<00:03:35.140> gets<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.410> special<00:03:36.860> fall<00:03:37.280> of<00:03:37.550> course<00:03:38.030> so<00:03:38.990> I

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:39.020 
and gets the special fall of course so I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:42.580 
and gets the special fall of course so I
have<00:03:39.410> to<00:03:39.620> switch<00:03:39.830> out<00:03:40.070> to<00:03:40.280> Toxicroak<00:03:40.940> and<00:03:41.590> I

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
have to switch out to Toxicroak and I

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.160 
have to switch out to Toxicroak and I
take<00:03:42.770> the<00:03:42.950> energy<00:03:43.190> ball<00:03:43.370> again<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:46.130> I<00:03:47.170> just

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:48.170 
take the energy ball again and I just

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.200 
take the energy ball again and I just
cross<00:03:48.470> chop<00:03:48.770> expecting<00:03:49.370> that<00:03:49.490> switch<00:03:49.760> and<00:03:50.120> it

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:50.210 
cross chop expecting that switch and it

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.310 
cross chop expecting that switch and it
does<00:03:50.480> over<00:03:51.320> half<00:03:51.620> to<00:03:51.980> the<00:03:52.070> draeken<00:03:52.630> but<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.990> know

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
does over half to the draeken but I know

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.560 
does over half to the draeken but I know
I'm<00:03:54.530> slower<00:03:54.860> so<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.190> can't<00:03:55.490> stay<00:03:55.700> in<00:03:55.880> so<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.210> have

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:56.570 
I'm slower so I can't stay in so I have

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:59.280 
I'm slower so I can't stay in so I have
to<00:03:56.810> switch<00:03:57.020> wheezing<00:03:57.470> into<00:03:57.890> the<00:03:58.040> earthquake

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
to switch wheezing into the earthquake

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.590 
to switch wheezing into the earthquake
and<00:04:00.290> he<00:04:00.410> said<00:04:00.560> didn't<00:04:00.800> swallow<00:04:00.980> I<00:04:01.280> get<00:04:02.030> lucky<00:04:02.270> I

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
and he said didn't swallow I get lucky I

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:04.750 
and he said didn't swallow I get lucky I
sleep<00:04:02.990> talk<00:04:03.230> to<00:04:03.410> sludge<00:04:03.680> bomb<00:04:03.950> this<00:04:04.190> time<00:04:04.490> so

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
sleep talk to sludge bomb this time so

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.600 
sleep talk to sludge bomb this time so
he's<00:04:04.910> not<00:04:05.090> burned<00:04:05.510> but<00:04:06.290> it<00:04:06.980> poisoned

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:07.610 
he's not burned but it poisoned

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.000 
he's not burned but it poisoned
him<00:04:07.760> so<00:04:08.000> it<00:04:08.120> activates<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.810> guts<00:04:09.050> anyways

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:15.599 

luckily<00:04:13.010> I<00:04:13.130> can<00:04:13.700> survive<00:04:14.510> the<00:04:14.810> facade<00:04:15.230> and

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
luckily I can survive the facade and

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:21.729 
luckily I can survive the facade and
thus<00:04:16.609> kill<00:04:17.090> the<00:04:17.239> swallow<00:04:18.700> and<00:04:20.230> he<00:04:21.230> sends<00:04:21.500> the

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
thus kill the swallow and he sends the

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.820 
thus kill the swallow and he sends the
Venus<00:04:22.400> or<00:04:22.550> back<00:04:22.760> in<00:04:23.030> and<00:04:23.390> I<00:04:23.480> just<00:04:23.510> let<00:04:24.020> him<00:04:24.230> kill

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
Venus or back in and I just let him kill

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.870 
Venus or back in and I just let him kill
me<00:04:24.860> with<00:04:25.100> leaf<00:04:25.280> storm<00:04:25.610> I<00:04:27.100> know<00:04:28.100> he's<00:04:28.310> stuck<00:04:28.700> on

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
me with leaf storm I know he's stuck on

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.790 
me with leaf storm I know he's stuck on
leaf<00:04:29.090> storm<00:04:29.360> after<00:04:29.900> a<00:04:29.930> special<00:04:30.110> attack<00:04:30.500> drop

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
leaf storm after a special attack drop

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.650 
leaf storm after a special attack drop
so<00:04:31.160> I'm<00:04:31.520> going<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.760> just<00:04:31.850> cross<00:04:32.330> chop

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
so I'm going to just cross chop

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.480 
so I'm going to just cross chop
expecting<00:04:33.169> the<00:04:33.260> drapion<00:04:33.620> I<00:04:33.860> would<00:04:34.400> have

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:34.490 
expecting the drapion I would have

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.130 
expecting the drapion I would have
swords<00:04:34.790> danced<00:04:35.150> but<00:04:35.330> then<00:04:35.540> I<00:04:35.600> would<00:04:35.660> be<00:04:35.840> slower

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
swords danced but then I would be slower

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.770 
swords danced but then I would be slower
and<00:04:36.440> not<00:04:36.650> able<00:04:36.860> to<00:04:36.980> kill<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.300> so<00:04:38.300> at<00:04:38.450> this<00:04:38.540> point

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:38.780 
and not able to kill it so at this point

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:41.500 
and not able to kill it so at this point
all<00:04:39.050> he<00:04:39.200> has<00:04:39.350> left<00:04:39.530> is<00:04:39.740> Venus<00:04:40.040> or<00:04:40.220> and<00:04:40.460> I<00:04:41.300> know<00:04:41.360> I

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:41.510 
all he has left is Venus or and I know I

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.010 
all he has left is Venus or and I know I
can<00:04:41.630> survive<00:04:41.990> a<00:04:42.200> leaf<00:04:42.500> storm<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.419> just<00:04:44.780> ice

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
can survive a leaf storm so I just ice

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.040
