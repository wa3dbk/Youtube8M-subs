00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.400
 hello here we want 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.230
 demonstrate the work of our new 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.460
 blocking 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:15.210
 Well, in order to convince you that she 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.400
 Easy to turn on is the machine exactly 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.380
 that blocking tight lips all 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.930
 diagonal hanging we set 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.939
 it is on the Lada accordingly 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:32.040
 rear wheel drive 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:34.050
 Well jack put the wheel back here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.010
 accordingly, we start the car 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.670
 nothing happens because 

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.550
 lock drink and go back and forth 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:48.300
 car and now we turn on 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.570
 lock it turns on like this 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:58.469
 way the cane is pulled well for 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:03.510
 you just have to change the position of the car 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.600
 This machine should include Appel 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:09.310
 try again 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.310
 hostel ass did not hit 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:27.540
 himself bad case only when the car 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:35.270
 lock saying up pull out turned on 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:35.270
 yes yes yes, try to get under way 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.980
 backwards 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.140
 tell yes now turn off and 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:01.340
 best we do not put 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:08.660
 and now we stop for which 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:12.220
 I hold the brake when yes yes, that's how it is 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.220
 turns on and again we see 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.379
 the authors 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:23.290
 and back the back that's what we wanted 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:26.459
 show though now but for everyone 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:26.459
 the case is all off 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.939
 and here we ate ours 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.590
 But with the lock turned off, it is 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:39.060
 can not turn on itself in any way 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.159
 accordingly, everything is very simple and 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.040
 reliably and does not render any 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:46.170
 additional resistance and resource 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.299
 with such a ride is also not limited 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:54.109
 stuck turned on left thanks we will 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:57.109
 show more about our will kirovke 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.109
