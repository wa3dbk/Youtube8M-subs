00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.140 
steelhead and salmon fish and wandered
here<00:00:10.320> but<00:00:10.920> it's<00:00:11.039> not<00:00:11.129> nearly<00:00:11.340> as<00:00:11.459> popular<00:00:11.789> as

here but it's not nearly as popular as
you<00:00:12.180> would<00:00:12.389> think<00:00:12.570> there's<00:00:13.379> one<00:00:13.530> reason<00:00:13.740> it's

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
you would think there's one reason it's

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:15.740 
you would think there's one reason it's
a<00:00:14.490> place<00:00:14.670> that<00:00:14.699> can<00:00:14.940> rise<00:00:15.119> up<00:00:15.270> and<00:00:15.480> bite<00:00:15.719> you

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
a place that can rise up and bite you

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.240 
a place that can rise up and bite you
too<00:00:15.959> but<00:00:16.110> if<00:00:16.260> you<00:00:16.320> get<00:00:16.440> it<00:00:16.529> wrong<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:17.070> called

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
too but if you get it wrong it's called

too but if you get it wrong it's called
rattlesnake<00:00:17.699> rabbit<00:00:18.650> now<00:00:19.650> rattlesnake<00:00:20.130> isn't

rattlesnake rabbit now rattlesnake isn't
tough<00:00:20.849> and<00:00:21.060> dangerous<00:00:21.269> because<00:00:21.750> it's<00:00:22.050> got<00:00:22.169> big

you gotta do them all right and it's not
enough<00:00:33.090> water<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.480> do<00:00:33.629> it<00:00:33.780> on<00:00:34.460> high<00:00:35.460> flows

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
per second it rolls pretty smoothly you

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
per second it rolls pretty smoothly you
can<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.600> over<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> rocks<00:00:40.170> that's<00:00:41.100> I<00:00:41.309> will<00:00:41.460> give

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
can go over the rocks that's I will give

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.849 
can go over the rocks that's I will give
you<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.670> lot<00:00:41.789> of<00:00:41.820> trouble<00:00:42.109> and<00:00:43.109> what<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.559> is<00:00:43.680> now

about<00:00:44.129> nine<00:00:44.399> hundred<00:00:44.430> CFS<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.989> can<00:00:46.140> be<00:00:46.199> a

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
about nine hundred CFS it can be a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.439 
about nine hundred CFS it can be a
little<00:00:46.379> bit<00:00:46.530> dicey<00:00:46.680> you<00:00:47.519> gotta<00:00:47.699> make<00:00:47.879> some

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
little bit dicey you gotta make some

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.810 
little bit dicey you gotta make some
really<00:00:48.570> good<00:00:48.780> strokes<00:00:49.140> and<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:50.129> do<00:00:50.340> end<00:00:50.670> up

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
really good strokes and you do end up

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.700 
really good strokes and you do end up
ping-pong<00:00:51.269> and<00:00:51.480> through<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.660> little<00:00:51.870> bit<00:00:51.989> it's

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
ping-pong and through a little bit it's

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.669 
ping-pong and through a little bit it's
really<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> hardest<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.940> roll<00:00:54.090> it<00:00:54.179> around

00:00:54.669 --> 00:00:54.679 
really the hardest to roll it around

00:00:54.679 --> 00:00:58.040 
really the hardest to roll it around
2,000<00:00:55.679> 2,200<00:00:56.010> CFS<00:00:56.789> that's<00:00:57.510> when<00:00:57.690> there's<00:00:57.840> just

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
2,000 2,200 CFS that's when there's just

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.540 
2,000 2,200 CFS that's when there's just
enough<00:00:58.230> water<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.530> push<00:00:58.769> your<00:00:58.920> boat<00:00:59.100> faster

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
enough water to push your boat faster

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.250 
enough water to push your boat faster
than<00:00:59.699> you<00:00:59.760> want<00:00:59.910> it<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.210> but<00:01:00.750> not<00:01:00.899> enough<00:01:01.140> to

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
than you want it to but not enough to

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.470 
than you want it to but not enough to

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
let you go straight over the rocks so

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.250 
let you go straight over the rocks so
take<00:01:04.230> a<00:01:04.260> run<00:01:04.440> it<00:01:05.360> this<00:01:06.360> is<00:01:06.540> definitely<00:01:06.870> a<00:01:06.990> rapid

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
take a run it this is definitely a rapid

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.540 
take a run it this is definitely a rapid
you<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.530> look<00:01:07.650> at<00:01:07.800> before<00:01:08.010> your<00:01:08.280> row<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 
you want to look at before your row it

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.460 
you want to look at before your row it
it<00:01:09.360> should<00:01:09.510> come<00:01:09.660> up<00:01:09.750> on<00:01:09.900> top<00:01:10.110> there's<00:01:10.350> nice

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
it should come up on top there's nice

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.860 
it should come up on top there's nice
slow<00:01:10.740> water<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.220> top<00:01:11.490> if<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.300> get<00:01:12.570> close

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:12.870 
slow water on top if you get close

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.360 
slow water on top if you get close
enough<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:13.170> can<00:01:13.440> see<00:01:13.620> there's<00:01:13.890> some<00:01:14.070> jagged

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
enough you can see there's some jagged

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.730 
enough you can see there's some jagged
rocks<00:01:14.760> sticking<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.300> pointed<00:01:15.690> downstream<00:01:15.870> you

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
rocks sticking up pointed downstream you

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.950 
rocks sticking up pointed downstream you
need<00:01:16.860> to<00:01:16.950> slip<00:01:17.250> your<00:01:17.370> boat<00:01:17.610> on<00:01:17.640> a<00:01:17.820> slight<00:01:18.270> angle

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
need to slip your boat on a slight angle

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.960 
need to slip your boat on a slight angle
toward<00:01:19.260> the<00:01:19.380> left<00:01:19.560> through<00:01:19.890> there<00:01:20.100> pull<00:01:20.820> off

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
toward the left through there pull off

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.940 
toward the left through there pull off
the<00:01:21.120> rock<00:01:21.300> at<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> bottom<00:01:21.900> and<00:01:22.380> then<00:01:22.590> set<00:01:22.830> up

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
the rock at the bottom and then set up

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.430 
the rock at the bottom and then set up
again<00:01:23.220> below<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> you'll<00:01:24.840> be<00:01:25.020> able<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.260> see

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
again below that you'll be able to see

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.320 
again below that you'll be able to see
another<00:01:25.860> very<00:01:26.160> skinny<00:01:26.580> little<00:01:26.820> chute<00:01:27.090> you

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
another very skinny little chute you

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.480 
another very skinny little chute you
drop<00:01:27.870> through<00:01:28.080> that<00:01:28.200> chute<00:01:28.500> then<00:01:29.220> you<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.370> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
drop through that chute then you have to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.240 
drop through that chute then you have to
pull<00:01:29.700> real<00:01:30.060> hard<00:01:30.090> straight<00:01:31.080> to<00:01:31.200> the<00:01:31.320> right<00:01:31.500> to

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
pull real hard straight to the right to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.609 
pull real hard straight to the right to
drop<00:01:32.430> through<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.820> final<00:01:33.060> little<00:01:33.360> inch

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
drop through that final little inch
