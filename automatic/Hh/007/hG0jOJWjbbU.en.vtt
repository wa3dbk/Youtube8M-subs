00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi everyone this is hitchcock 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.549
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.400
 new video tips on my channel 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.870
 today I teach you how to use 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.130
 this method that I use is often 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 for cats ni and that I use 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.639
 still a little today the method of 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.020
 chain fishing 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.300
 so what is this method 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.300
 it's a method that has appeared in 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.130
 this war on the temple and hemani cy 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.750
 and which is to fish pokemon 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.189
 simply to the chain that 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.720
 works a bit like radar except 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.500
 that the first radar is a little bit more 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.149
 restricted in terms of possibilities 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.570
 while chain fishing you 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:38.280
 you'll see it's easier to use but 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.250
 it must be as concentrated as for the 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.110
 radar poker then for that to do 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.180
 so that this chain fishing 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.180
 what you need you already need 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.710
 a pokemon with cupping talent or 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.329
 glue talent so why do you 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.399
 will allow you to fish for sure 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:01.199
 pokemon when you sins them because 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:03.570
 if you also fish and get 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.430
 said it does not bite the chain breaks 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.270
 town had to start from scratch so the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:13.439
 tilly mound real talent cupping you 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 can also it's optional 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.570
 have a pokemon with synchro talent 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.460
 in this case it will be necessary to put the 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.890
 pokemon having talent sucker for 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:26.220
 to be able to benefit from cupping effects 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.290
 but having as pokemon hours in 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.820
 tree sent first their fight the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.110
 pokemon and in sync - he's a guy from 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.689
 see with the modest nature and he you 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.299
 need a pokemon having surf that's it 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.759
 so here's the excuse me so that's 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.930
 for pokemon then for objects 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.450
 you need a regrowth to be able to 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.360
 to go quietly without problem towards 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.310
 the area where you go fishing and you 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.110
 go register one of the three guns 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.330
 the can cane super canola guy like me 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:04.000
 I recorded the best then 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:06.310
 we will go to a place that is done 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.750
 to be chain fishing so for 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.400
 to go to fish rightly the 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.700
 to be sure of having the chances and 

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.810
 more optimal to have a cat or 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.830
 so to Europe boost to nothing 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.390
 because me it's good abbassi the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.400
 regrowth month will be useless because 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380
 as my pack lead only at level 35 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.210
 even though I had done the vicky regrowth 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.650
 its level 50 here it is useless and 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:28.030
 a lot 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.380
 hoping you'll understand see 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.580
 the gap to see is a recruitment has been 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.900
 sent first though it was at 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.600
 little healed the first in the press of 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.670
 the team in the first place of the team 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.840
 excuse me I'll get there I'll you 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.540
 assure that I 'll get there I'll 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.650
 succeed in articulating and speaking well so 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.570
 you put a place you can 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:49.630
 to fish without being too far from the rocks 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:51.370
 so here you go fishing here because 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.500
 that the more you finally fish if you 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.990
 fish in a place that is pretty 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.210
 musty you will have good chances 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.390
 more optimal to have a kennel you 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:02.380
 will have more luck then you then I 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.239
 said it was like poker 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.550
 radars why because in fact that 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.470
 is to look for pokemon but there 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.100
 it's easier still because you 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.280
 can run away 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.390
 and if the pokemon you meet by 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.600
 example so complicated but we can 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:18.550
 meet is one of the pies and that the 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.640
 second is a sheet that she does not address 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.840
 the chain is against things 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.570
 they want and the chain for example 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.330
 change canes during hunting 

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.239
 slope in the course of chain fishing there 

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:32.709
 is also the fact that precisely this does not 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:34.000
 do not bite so that's why we 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:35.590
 are you going to absolutely have to take 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.970
 talent cupping or sticky others 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.209
 teams have for example you have 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:41.780
 cupping the little tunes he owns 

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:46.010
 and glue you have 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:49.310
 these biotopes and 6-4 in the pen it's me 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.470
 seems and something else that breaks the 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.319
 chain is going up the line too much 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:55.880
 soon or too late sas protected chain 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.010
 so we'll start right away 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:04:01.360
 so you can of course do it on purpose 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.590
 to miss the first fishing to be able to 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:08.510
 from a fishing in China to 0 

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:11.510
 personally I not here 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:16.609
 so I'm too close a little and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:19.720
 prevents one is focused and one is there one 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:23.079
 is concentrated and reads iron 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.079
 excuse me for a second 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.900
 so here we are going to flee it's not a 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.440
 oak so long as it's not a cat or 

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.970
 you can run away and the more you'll be able to 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.350
 chagny finally not anything anymore 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:47.420
 offered and the pokÃ©mon as a result without 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.740
 break the chain of course and more the 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.770
 chance to meet a sheriff in the 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.090
 next fight is high 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:56.660
 so I do not know I do not think you 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:05:01.520
 show when you say it's not you 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.170
 show the cat or if it appears 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.400
 so I imagine so the unique ganache to 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:09.980
 Paris is a miracle when 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:10.940
 either no last east there must 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.530
 to be focused because you have to call 

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.860
 at the right time that's the poker thing 

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:17.390
 it's like poker the forest concentrated 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:20.200
 here we are going to do two more like this 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.200
 I show you a little 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.630
 so I do not know if I'll do any more 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.880
 videos tips on cats nor easy to 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:35.520
 have because status this trick there 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:37.140
 is the simplest and the pokemon the name 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.830
 of pokemon before chaining broken remains 

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:43.580
 rance finally his time is good oh 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.580
 it is quite a pity indeed 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:52.220
 so here are I want to 

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:54.590
 specify that the next video that I 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.440
 would do is a forgiveness video is a 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:06:01.580
 video tips I had already posted 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:02.660
 but that was not posted in fact so 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:06.740
 it's a video that will maybe you 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:09.140
 also serve who is where we are happy 

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.700
 when we put it we do not see the utility in 

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.930
 done but I see it the difficulties 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:14.360
 to allow you to do a lot of 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:15.860
 things you are going to see so here it is 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.750
 we stop for this trick 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.640
 I hope these videos will please you if 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.410
 this is the case do not hesitate to like the 

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:23.180
 video if you did not like this 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.310
 video you can always specify it 

00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:27.980

 how to say that me marc henzelin yes 

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:31.820
 because like that I will be why 

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:32.960
 this video was not appreciated we say 

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.880
 in the comments like that eat the 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:37.820
 smile and I was improving time the 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:39.890
 next video you can share 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.720
 this video put a comment if 

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:44.420
