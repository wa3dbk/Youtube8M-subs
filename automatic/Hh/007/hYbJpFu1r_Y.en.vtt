pc so it's big news to me because there
is<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> huge<00:00:24.990> change<00:00:25.800> that<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.670> know<00:00:26.789> they<00:00:27.090> made

is a huge change that you know they made
it<00:00:27.449> look<00:00:27.480> like<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.750> wasn't<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.080> big<00:00:28.109> deal<00:00:28.260> but

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
it look like it wasn't a big deal but

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.320 
it look like it wasn't a big deal but
I'm<00:00:29.099> just<00:00:29.250> hoping<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.580> translation<00:00:30.150> was

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
I'm just hoping the translation was

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.730 
I'm just hoping the translation was
correct<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.080> was<00:00:31.170> translated<00:00:31.619> to

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
correct because it was translated to

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.319 
correct because it was translated to
English<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.189> his<00:00:32.279> full<00:00:32.489> speaking<00:00:33.059> full

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
cell graphics which if you don't know I

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.780 
cell graphics which if you don't know I
use<00:01:02.039> for<00:01:02.219> making<00:01:02.340> video<00:01:03.149> game<00:01:03.420> characters

because they're on the next gen console
in<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.710> gap<00:01:07.830> that<00:01:08.100> can<00:01:08.220> actually<00:01:08.520> enhance<00:01:08.790> the

in the gap that can actually enhance the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.060 
in the gap that can actually enhance the
graphics<00:01:09.360> that<00:01:09.510> way<00:01:09.720> I<00:01:09.930> guess<00:01:10.619> on<00:01:10.770> YouTube

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
graphics that way I guess on YouTube

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
graphics that way I guess on YouTube

as you guys have seen already there are
burning<00:01:21.450> effects<00:01:21.780> which<00:01:21.930> I'll<00:01:22.049> go<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.439> above

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
burning effects which I'll go into above

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.390 
burning effects which I'll go into above
the<00:01:23.430> specific<00:01:23.909> information<00:01:24.390> on<00:01:24.990> them<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.650> you

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
the specific information on them and you

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.160 
the specific information on them and you
know<00:01:26.549> loads<00:01:26.820> of<00:01:26.939> other<00:01:27.000> stuff<00:01:27.390> like<00:01:27.689> lightning

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
know loads of other stuff like lightning

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.219 
know loads of other stuff like lightning
looks<00:01:28.320> much<00:01:28.560> better<00:01:28.890> and<00:01:29.810> moves<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.960> supposed

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
looks much better and moves are supposed

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.109

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
to feel like they have more of an impact

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.300 
to feel like they have more of an impact
I<00:01:33.540> hope<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.960> they<00:01:34.110> add<00:01:34.229> more<00:01:34.470> screen<00:01:34.860> shaking

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
I hope that they add more screen shaking

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.940 
I hope that they add more screen shaking
when<00:01:35.820> attacks<00:01:36.600> are<00:01:36.780> being<00:01:36.900> done<00:01:37.320> though

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
that's one thing I'd like them to do but

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.690 
that's one thing I'd like them to do but

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
in awakening is a big deal for me and I

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.780 
in awakening is a big deal for me and I
wish<00:01:58.020> I<00:01:58.140> could<00:01:58.290> go<00:01:58.380> into<00:01:58.530> even<00:01:58.920> more<00:01:58.950> of<00:01:59.369> how<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
wish I could go into even more of how to

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.249

balance<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.540> I<00:02:00.600> guess<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:00.840> could<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.140> that

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
balance of it I guess I could make that

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.080 
balance of it I guess I could make that
into<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.469> separate<00:02:01.770> video<00:02:01.920> but<00:02:02.670> guys<00:02:02.759> tell<00:02:03.030> me

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
I've seen it a lot of gameplay sometimes

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.229 
I've seen it a lot of gameplay sometimes

only one person will awaken and then the

only one person will awaken and then the
rest<00:03:21.389> won't<00:03:21.599> but<00:03:22.200> that<00:03:22.349> might<00:03:22.560> trying<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.400> the

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
rest won't but that might trying to the

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:24.890 
rest won't but that might trying to the
new<00:03:23.639> factor<00:03:23.970> they<00:03:24.090> talked<00:03:24.299> about<00:03:24.389> a<00:03:24.540> cool-down

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
new factor they talked about a cool-down

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.589 
new factor they talked about a cool-down
period<00:03:25.139> between<00:03:25.739> when<00:03:25.950> you<00:03:26.220> can<00:03:26.370> switch<00:03:26.609> even

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:27.599 
period between when you can switch even

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:28.640 
period between when you can switch even
though<00:03:27.660> in<00:03:27.780> this<00:03:27.900> video<00:03:28.109> it<00:03:28.230> seemed<00:03:28.379> like<00:03:28.530> they

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
though in this video it seemed like they

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.319 
though in this video it seemed like they
were<00:03:28.769> switching<00:03:29.069> like<00:03:29.430> hotcakes<00:03:29.700> it<00:03:30.090> wasn't

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
were switching like hotcakes it wasn't

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:31.610 
were switching like hotcakes it wasn't
like<00:03:30.419> they<00:03:30.569> was<00:03:30.660> didn't<00:03:30.989> literally<00:03:31.379> have<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
like they was didn't literally have to

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:33.619 
like they was didn't literally have to
wait<00:03:31.799> for<00:03:31.829> any<00:03:32.099> time<00:03:32.370> but<00:03:32.700> obviously<00:03:33.329> if<00:03:33.480> you

00:03:33.619 --> 00:03:33.629 
wait for any time but obviously if you

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:35.240 
wait for any time but obviously if you
switch<00:03:33.930> you<00:03:34.530> can't<00:03:34.739> just<00:03:34.859> switch<00:03:35.040> back<00:03:35.220> and

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
switch you can't just switch back and

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.349 
switch you can't just switch back and
forth<00:03:35.430> back<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.760> forth<00:03:35.879> back<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.209> forth

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
forth back and forth back and forth

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.240 
forth back and forth back and forth
there's<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.109> cool-down<00:03:37.319> period<00:03:37.500> before<00:03:37.980> you

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
there's a cool-down period before you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.069 
there's a cool-down period before you
can<00:03:38.430> lead<00:03:38.940> us<00:03:38.970> which<00:03:39.269> again<00:03:39.540> when<00:03:39.900> i<00:03:39.930> say

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:40.079 
can lead us which again when i say

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:41.509 
can lead us which again when i say
leader<00:03:40.290> switches<00:03:40.650> like<00:03:40.739> the<00:03:40.889> tag<00:03:41.069> team<00:03:41.310> for

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:41.519 
leader switches like the tag team for

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.689 
leader switches like the tag team for
you<00:03:41.609> can<00:03:41.730> tag<00:03:41.940> your<00:03:42.180> teammate<00:03:43.079> back<00:03:43.769> in<00:03:44.010> and<00:03:44.609> i

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:44.699 
you can tag your teammate back in and i

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:46.400 
you can tag your teammate back in and i
think<00:03:44.910> all<00:03:45.060> these<00:03:45.209> things<00:03:45.449> are<00:03:45.599> super<00:03:45.930> cool
