00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
like facing like where the cameras are

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.060 
like facing like where the cameras are
here<00:03:43.959> I'm<00:03:44.049> facing<00:03:44.230> this<00:03:44.440> way<00:03:44.500> usually<00:03:44.890> when<00:03:45.010> I

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:45.070 
here I'm facing this way usually when I

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.580 
here I'm facing this way usually when I
game<00:03:45.250> so<00:03:46.239> it<00:03:46.660> soaks<00:03:46.900> up<00:03:47.019> most<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.440> thing

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:47.590 
game so it soaks up most of the thing

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:50.789 
game so it soaks up most of the thing
you<00:03:47.709> gets<00:03:47.890> rid<00:03:48.010> of<00:03:48.070> the<00:03:48.160> echo<00:03:48.459> and<00:03:49.799> yeah

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
you gets rid of the echo and yeah

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.420 
you gets rid of the echo and yeah

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:24.570 
but I think I'm going to change now to
what<00:04:22.960> programs<00:04:23.440> I<00:04:23.620> use<00:04:23.860> as

what programs I use as

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.300 
what programs I use as
like<00:04:24.909> what<00:04:25.210> would<00:04:25.360> be<00:04:25.449> the<00:04:25.569> best<00:04:26.280> for<00:04:27.280> a

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
like what would be the best for a

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.189 
like what would be the best for a
start-up<00:04:27.759> to<00:04:27.819> do<00:04:28.060> what<00:04:28.509> essentials<00:04:29.110> you

00:04:29.189 --> 00:04:29.199 
start-up to do what essentials you

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.050 
start-up to do what essentials you
really<00:04:29.440> need<00:04:29.590> so<00:04:30.099> yeah<00:04:30.220> let's<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.699> let's

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
really need so yeah let's do that let's

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:33.390 
really need so yeah let's do that let's
go<00:04:31.180> to<00:04:31.210> that<00:04:31.919> all<00:04:32.919> right<00:04:33.039> let's<00:04:33.190> jump<00:04:33.340> right

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
go to that all right let's jump right

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.020 
go to that all right let's jump right
into<00:04:33.669> it

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
into it

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.270 
into it
okay<00:04:34.389> let's<00:04:34.599> start<00:04:34.780> out<00:04:34.870> with<00:04:35.280> capturing

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
okay let's start out with capturing

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
okay let's start out with capturing
device<00:04:36.580> software

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:37.300 
device software

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.540 
device software
I<00:04:37.330> would<00:04:37.840> suggest<00:04:38.020> whatever<00:04:38.740> capture<00:04:39.340> device

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
I would suggest whatever capture device

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.430 
I would suggest whatever capture device
you<00:04:39.699> get<00:04:39.909> you<00:04:40.300> use<00:04:40.479> the<00:04:40.690> programs<00:04:41.139> that<00:04:41.319> come

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
you get you use the programs that come

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:44.339 
you get you use the programs that come
with<00:04:41.710> that<00:04:41.740> capture<00:04:42.220> device<00:04:43.169> however<00:04:44.169> there's

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
with that capture device however there's

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.110 
with that capture device however there's
other<00:04:44.530> options<00:04:44.949> for<00:04:45.099> you<00:04:45.280> that<00:04:45.729> you<00:04:45.819> can<00:04:45.970> use

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
other options for you that you can use

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.820 
other options for you that you can use
that<00:04:46.680> sometimes<00:04:47.680> also<00:04:47.979> record<00:04:48.490> PC<00:04:49.289> which<00:04:50.289> like

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
that sometimes also record PC which like

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.309 
that sometimes also record PC which like
for<00:04:51.069> example<00:04:51.690> xsplit<00:04:52.690> is<00:04:52.840> one<00:04:52.990> of<00:04:53.110> them<00:04:53.199> which

00:04:53.309 --> 00:04:53.319 
for example xsplit is one of them which

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:55.469 
for example xsplit is one of them which
is<00:04:53.440> what<00:04:53.590> I<00:04:53.620> use<00:04:53.860> however<00:04:54.520> I'm<00:04:55.030> thinking<00:04:55.389> about

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:55.479 
is what I use however I'm thinking about

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:57.390 
is what I use however I'm thinking about
changing<00:04:55.990> it's<00:04:56.530> a<00:04:56.620> great<00:04:56.800> program<00:04:57.039> and

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
changing it's a great program and

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:00.149 
changing it's a great program and
everything<00:04:57.580> but<00:04:58.300> I<00:04:58.719> it's<00:04:59.199> just<00:04:59.349> I<00:04:59.620> paid<00:04:59.889> for<00:05:00.129> it

00:05:00.149 --> 00:05:00.159 
everything but I it's just I paid for it

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.430 
everything but I it's just I paid for it
like<00:05:00.430> every<00:05:00.729> three<00:05:01.060> months<00:05:01.270> or<00:05:01.659> something

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
like every three months or something

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.290 
like every three months or something
like<00:05:02.560> that<00:05:02.620> with<00:05:02.979> a<00:05:03.009> update<00:05:03.580> you<00:05:03.969> know<00:05:04.060> keep

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
like that with a update you know keep

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.600 
like that with a update you know keep
the<00:05:04.449> license<00:05:05.080> updated<00:05:05.530> I'm<00:05:06.280> thinking<00:05:06.550> about

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
the license updated I'm thinking about

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.550 
the license updated I'm thinking about
switching<00:05:07.300> to<00:05:07.389> one<00:05:07.569> called<00:05:07.810> dick<00:05:08.020> story<00:05:08.259> I

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
switching to one called dick story I

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.209 
switching to one called dick story I
hear<00:05:09.099> it's<00:05:09.250> great<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:10.440> however<00:05:11.440> it<00:05:11.740> has<00:05:11.919> big

00:05:12.209 --> 00:05:12.219 
hear it's great and however it has big

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:13.770 
hear it's great and however it has big
file<00:05:12.460> sizes<00:05:12.729> but<00:05:12.969> I<00:05:13.030> think<00:05:13.300> my<00:05:13.419> hard<00:05:13.599> drives

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:13.780 
file sizes but I think my hard drives

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.790 
file sizes but I think my hard drives
