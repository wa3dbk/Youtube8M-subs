little map here to show you where they
are

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.970 

which<00:02:11.510> is<00:02:11.630> pretty<00:02:11.750> great<00:02:12.020> what<00:02:12.740> about<00:02:12.830> the

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.660 

just<00:02:43.790> thought<00:02:44.060> I'd

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:56.520 

holy<00:02:49.330> guacamole<00:02:50.430> that's<00:02:51.430> gonna<00:02:51.700> kill<00:02:52.060> me

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:56.530 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.320 

hate<00:02:57.040> to<00:02:57.280> say<00:02:57.459> I<00:02:57.490> told<00:02:57.610> you<00:02:58.090> so<00:02:58.209> Willie<00:02:58.690> I<00:02:59.020> did

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.430 

just<00:03:05.330> thought<00:03:05.570> I'd<00:03:05.690> throw<00:03:05.720> a<00:03:05.960> little<00:03:06.140> more

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
just thought I'd throw a little more

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.860 
just thought I'd throw a little more
proof<00:03:07.400> that<00:03:07.430> Willie<00:03:07.850> is<00:03:08.060> the<00:03:08.090> worst<00:03:08.450> child

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
proof that Willie is the worst child

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.860 
proof that Willie is the worst child
ever<00:03:09.140> out<00:03:09.410> there<00:03:11.950> this<00:03:12.950> is<00:03:13.820> an<00:03:13.970> exact<00:03:14.390> replica

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
ever out there this is an exact replica

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.850 
ever out there this is an exact replica
of<00:03:15.350> summer<00:03:16.340> it's<00:03:17.020> one<00:03:18.020> of<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.200> pups<00:03:18.440> had<00:03:18.830> a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
of summer it's one of the pups had a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.830 
of summer it's one of the pups had a
working<00:03:19.160> beer<00:03:19.610> tap<00:03:19.910> until<00:03:20.120> the<00:03:20.390> night<00:03:20.570> Willie

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
working beer tap until the night Willie

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.200 
working beer tap until the night Willie
passed<00:03:21.230> out<00:03:21.560> in<00:03:21.740> his<00:03:21.830> mashed<00:03:22.100> potato

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.140 

anyways<00:03:26.210> I<00:03:27.340> figured<00:03:28.340> I'd<00:03:28.490> just<00:03:28.730> show<00:03:29.000> this

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
anyways I figured I'd just show this

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.820 
anyways I figured I'd just show this
little<00:03:29.300> thing<00:03:29.570> off<00:03:29.750> now<00:03:29.780> since<00:03:30.410> I'm<00:03:30.530> not<00:03:30.680> going

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
little thing off now since I'm not going

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.410 
little thing off now since I'm not going
to<00:03:30.890> be<00:03:30.950> able<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.190> do<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.550> during<00:03:32.030> the<00:03:32.240> normal

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
to be able to do it during the normal

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.480 
to be able to do it during the normal
gameplay<00:03:32.750> and<00:03:33.530> I<00:03:33.800> figure<00:03:34.040> doesn't<00:03:34.160> make<00:03:34.310> good

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
gameplay and I figure doesn't make good

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:36.040 
gameplay and I figure doesn't make good
test<00:03:34.760> to<00:03:34.850> see<00:03:35.000> if<00:03:35.030> my<00:03:35.210> new<00:03:35.330> sound<00:03:35.510> options<00:03:35.750> are

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
test to see if my new sound options are

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:40.690 
test to see if my new sound options are
a<00:03:36.080> little<00:03:36.170> better<00:03:36.610> anyways<00:03:37.690> waiter
