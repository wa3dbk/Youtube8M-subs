00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.510
 she cares 

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.549
 then the minute free kick comes to the 1 

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.539
 are all interest groups look like the former Gladbacher is that 

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.480
 most beautiful Martin Suter SZ 1 13 

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.630
 especially the whole system 12 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.000
 also countable both teams unchanged 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.920
 but it worked together with Georg Aerni Petersen at least 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.269
 Smile 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.150
 I stop being indexed at the beginning of the second half 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:33.090
 Sebastian had the Borussia 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.360
 loves the more dangerous team is after the second round this is a 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.500
 Party »scale 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.540
 6 6 2 and plays 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
 after changing the food costs strength 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.080
 Star ports 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.740
 Location but Lehmann 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.730
 Doll he has prevailed but stop players 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.530
 a canopy in possession problem 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.470
 on the first point 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.170
 so showed with Büskens 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:00.230
 Woolfson Mölders 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.230
 So now are more in midfield back than ball distributors 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.980
 Suter Wulff of the Gardeccia number of the Czechs 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.090
 the the top 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.310
 Uwe Scherr is that 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.310
 Diesßen Michael Klinkert money 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.280
 The end is 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.300
 they tolerated it 

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:21.540
 but the success here 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.540
 otherwise she's in the game forward 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.650
 the club has him yes 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.880
 there are many undamaged from now on quite a lot on the right wing 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.440
 and again offside 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.090
 What a church from the Neckar Valley 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.120
 Although 14 not four but actually it's just a point in it he was whole 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:46.120
 weak 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.580
 then it was time Michael Sternkopf a lot of costs and in the 61 minute 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.610
 the 62 year old Swede 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.060
 Jürgen Petersen now with lawsuits merger and Recklinghäuser 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.450
 Magnificently disappointed with a boundless and Michael Stern 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:11.790
 not only for the players but it was for me that I was right from the beginning 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.369
 Nothing 

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:15.279
 we have won the last games all to 200 

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.709
 but that's just a team change for me that was that 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.879
 we hope you know us 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:23.899
 not that it is more and more 

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:25.879
 with this coach Worms 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.239
 I do not know 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.629
 completely disappointed 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.629
 Heike Faller played 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.120
 the funny carnival in the inquiries with scientists they would have 

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:39.270
 Play big pudgy after cheap passage one now 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:42.270
 but also a little worse but there the Marti since the 

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.829
 faster than Mancuso USA but ultimately 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.249
 harmless this but nothing they see now or Borussia Mönchengladbach 

00:02:50.249 --> 00:02:51.669
 sink again slightly 

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:55.519
 the Semana suspicion as Schalke where meanwhile Olaf Thon injured with 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.519
 a muscle hardening excreted for him 

00:02:59.169 --> 00:03:01.029
 left it played 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:04.519
 can be booked 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:07.519
 Let's see what the club 

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:11.549
 in the product selection Kleemann lets leave clench 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:19.169
 2 1 72 for the users that fits because it ensures there for a share exchange 

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.439
 Most New Year tourists get out of the way of the other corner 

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.039
 the leather unhappy 

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:36.109
 there also slipped out let the ball and abklatschen 

00:03:36.109 --> 00:03:38.159
 the Swede is on the spot 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:40.229
 Düren is then again 

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:44.389
 Karsten Maier and Renate Beckmann on the curtain play Martin Dahlin 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.969
 Counter of the distance 

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:49.659
 I mean no, the walls were indeed informed about applicants 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.390
 Plattling can see the second goal through 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.809
 to let 

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:00.299
 as the FC Schalke granted finally stopped but again as a reminder 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.499
 the one stored there and his injured 5 altogether 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.269
 Master players were missing the letter 

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:10.719
 Marco short 

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:16.349
 he played well to the Weser TV Gladbeck for the sake of God George MTV 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:19.419
 be better 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.330
 the rather fifth ball contact square first shot on goal on the a 10 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:25.099
 Minutes Bartecko into play 

00:04:25.099 --> 00:04:27.939
 That's why a new man can comment 

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:29.629
 to send the agency 

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:33.870
 He has tasted Rainer Adrion for Malmö twelve of the 15 times 

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.849
 and now also the first quarter but have Pecresse again 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:40.969
 the ball got stuck in the grass here 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.090
 Are perpetrators 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:46.090
 Dance tea man out 

00:04:48.379 --> 00:04:52.370
 they can imagine what was here now for a mood to pull the strings 

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:55.210
 can against Sweden they have three 

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:56.550
 the Rheinische Post 

00:04:56.550 --> 00:05:01.409
 and thus they did not have corner Gladbacher karl-heinz websites 

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:04.159
 now she has against it 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:05.610
 the 1 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.740
 Mountain Rescue Sweden had 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.169
 OK 6 min 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.520
 Her work will be in Sweden Heathrow Airport and here is a Swede 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.650
 since then it had suddenly been overtaken and that 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.699
 within just 11 six minutes of play 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:27.169
 As with the reactor 1 is the total of Borussia in a row, the man of the day 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.809
 just in these games at home three goals when talking can be very proud 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:32.830
 though him 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:36.279
 the houses started after the game Vincent 

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.879
 there is a really beautiful Swedish 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:41.879
 the latest version of the historical heritage of the citizens 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:45.129
 Gate in Zurich 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.249
 because they know how it was better in the last three years than only 

00:05:48.249 --> 00:05:51.249
 Athlete all or nothing 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:55.939
 big staff worries 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:01.689
 Whenever he comes Loew but since Saturday morning 000 Euro 

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:06.490
 No matter how Nancy with the director got it right 

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.020
 on the other hand as Daddy's back to Hamburg 

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:11.229
 the bottoming
