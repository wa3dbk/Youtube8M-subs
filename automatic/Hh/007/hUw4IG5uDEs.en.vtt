00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:05.240
 During the decade of the 60s, the first

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:18.690

 of the event since 1970 and would be the official supplier of the balls 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.819

 that having been Teresa times champion received the honor of keeping it 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.720
 after years of research and research finally in 1988 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.549
 they found the person responsible for the robbery 

00:00:56.549 --> 00:00:59.600
 however the cup was never recovered 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.260
 thanks to the criminals who fused it and sold it as a network 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:10.120
 replacement trophy was introduced in the 1974 soccer world cup 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.120

 for 1986 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.509
 the international body 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.910
 decided that mexico would host the tournament again 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.640
 because it kept largely 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:39.590
 the state infrastructure 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:42.590
 970 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.119
 Argentina advanced unstoppable largely due to the talent of diego armando 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.590
 maradona in the quarterfinals 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.920
 the albiceleste team must confront England one of its most traditional 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.909
 rivals especially after the outbreak of the war of the Malvinas four 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.290
 years before

 sport in the 51st minute maradona scored a goal with his hand we met 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.129
 like the hand of god 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.750
 4 the same maradona remembered 62 meters in 

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:21.049
 surpassing six Englishmen 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.479
 before scoring the so-called goal of the century 

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:29.119
 the final with the victory of Argentina came to Maradona as the best player 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:30.319
 of the tournament 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.800

 the fifa decided in the soccer world cup of 1994 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.599
 was the one disputed in that country 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.560
 resulted in the murder once the team participation ended 

00:02:56.559 --> 00:03:01.579
 from colombia that his defense andrÃ©s escobar after he accidentally 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:03.819
 they made an own goal 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.589
 It also meant the end of the brilliant international career of 

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:10.280
 maradona after he tested positive 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.569
 in your doping text 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:13.650
 the championship 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.899
 would be defined for the first time in a shootout 

00:03:16.899 --> 00:03:19.740
 after roberto valley fire with his shot 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.640
 Brazil conquered its pentacampeonato 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.260
 when I had been without lifting the cup for 24 hours 

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:34.409
 and the one from France 98 brazil the championship was disputed with the eleventh host 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.269
 but very far from the jogo bonito and with ronaldo his main striker injured 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.159
 perhaps he imposed his game by becoming the champion of 

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:46.500
 the official theme of this world cup and the cup of life interpreted 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:48.330
 masterfully by ricky martin 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.369
 in Spanish English and French 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:54.669
 It was a global explosion, making them the subject until now 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.040
 more significant 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.299
 in this championship 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:03.510
 for the 2006 cup the fifa decided to establish a rotation system 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.489

 was organized at least once for each confederation 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.519
 by certain danger

 Africa would be the first continent elected 

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.209
 and South Africa would be widely supported as the headquarters of the World Cup of

 2010 football in the same way the 2014 football world cup has been 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:30.139
 assigned South America for which Brazil has already been nominated 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:34.289
 The World Cup represents a world party where people from 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:36.130
