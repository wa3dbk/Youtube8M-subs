00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.910
 we are in los angeles where we are 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.890
 just finished multiplayer re 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.660
 of call of duty gorn lots of le 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.380
 new among nine weapons the new third e 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.790
 new ways 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.950
 even if there has not been that evolution 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.390
 that many expected clans that 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:26.710
 search and rescue are definitely the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.689
 two modes that stole the show 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.519
 the first carries the call of frenzy 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.019
 duty at the highest levels because between 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.449
 killing and the other the player will have 

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:36.280
 only 30 seconds to perform other kills 

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.110
 otherwise a bomb is attached 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
 the player will exclude causing death 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.980
 search and rescue instead an evolution 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.269
 who confirms the players this time 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.219
 besides having to collect the medals 

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:47.379
 which will establish permanently and 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.000
 the death of an opponent will also have to 

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.410
 defend of the designated spots where 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.820
 enemies will try to place some 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.440
 explosive devices 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.699
 the round will end obviously or at 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.920
 detonation of the explosive oa 

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.940
 the complete elimination of the team for 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.859
 regarding personalization 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.840
 of the classes there are many new things 

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.520
 as we said at the beginning 30 are the new ones 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.680
 test drive and obviously will be one of 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.660
 these and places have been revised in 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.430
 importantly it will no longer be a means 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.220
 flying but not a simple house to place 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.420
 on the ground exactly like the turrets 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.770
 many of the perks have been revised 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.780
 there will be no more air strikes and 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:17.950
 devastating but it will all be brought to the 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.509
 player level this for 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.710
 obviously favor a game more 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.240
 dynamic than before 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.759
 regarding personalization 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.380
 of weapons the pic ten is founded instead 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:28.390
 with what we have seen in modern warfare 3 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.549
 that is, there will always be the possibility of 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.290
 add ironside myring subcanna 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:34.900
 your weapons in an unlimited way 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.430
 this time with respect to p and third parties 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.439
 instead they will be tied as always to the 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.119
 classes previously viewed the class of 

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:42.159
 support for example will keep its 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:43.659
 killstreak even after death while 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.520
 new features have been introduced for 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.320
 speed up the assault trick stocks 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.790
 during enemy kills they will leave 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.710
 fall of the camp orders that 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.409
 collected and completed will give to 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:55.030
 player a bust in points also the 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.740
 prestige has been revised this time 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.810
 it will be possible to reach only one 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.700
 level of prestige but will be granted 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.020
 have ten soldiers different from 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.030
 customize both aesthetically 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.259
 that as a skill and how it perks and will be 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:07.090
 You can pick up these ten 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.440
 soldiers in a distinct way 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.789
 the whole is not an end in itself seen 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.470
 which then our team can be 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.390
 sent online to play against others 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.620
 real players or even better we can 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.930
 tell of our friends for 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.040
 face opposing teams here in los 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.750
 angeles we got to try 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.880
 all these innovations in an abundant hour 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.510
 of play and obviously make four 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.540
 chat with the developers 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.730
 elections xvi takes call of duty ghost is 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.829
 still a pure call of duty does not occur 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.049
 it's a revolution because this 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.150
 it's still the game that everyone knows 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.579
 I had a graphical view if you put in 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.370
 compare the xbox 360 and xbox versions 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.170
 one you immediately realize is there 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.790
 was a big step forward but 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.560
 certainly cannot be found 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.019
 same evolution as in the 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.690
 transition from resolution 480 to 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:52.609
 four thirds to hd dai resolution 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.189
 cathode ray tube screens to those in high 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:58.069
 definition because with xbox one 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.170
 the resolution has always happened yet 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.870
 however, there is a step forward 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.060
 animations audio the system of 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.099
 berkine flexible kabil are gods 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.370
 clear improvements that constitute a 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:11.930
 new chapter for the series about the 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:13.519
 burke system the new system 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.200
 lets you choose perks a 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.370
 regardless of the groups in which they are 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.379
 included 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.760
 it is not necessary to acquire perk only 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:22.280
 of a specific category 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.200
 for example if you want to create a powerful 5 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.970
 he can only choose what you do 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.590
 serves for that map and for that 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.260
 specific game mode 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.359
 in this way the system also makes the 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.269
 more functional weapons depending on the 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:36.290
 player's needs 

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:37.579
 regarding the maps we have included 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.859
 different points than the players 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.489
 they will learn to use their own 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.650
 benefit 

00:03:40.489 --> 00:03:44.720
 for example to place mines or for 

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.329
 tend ambushes and their adversaries 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.099
 all maps have the same number as 

00:03:47.329 --> 00:03:51.470
 there are some hot spots 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:51.829
 very rich in strategic points and others 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.199
 less 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.599
 in any case, there is nothing ending in itself 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:58.549
 itself and it's all really useful a 

00:03:56.599 --> 00:04:03.040
 complete what you want to do 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.040
 on the field among the things barabino biro
