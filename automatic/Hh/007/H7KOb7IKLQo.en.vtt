00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 hey people of mine are there today 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.799
 again a few call and that was me 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:06.540
 a few days ago there and got me 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.460
 also some bought it are indeed 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.570
 but rather simple things but 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.040
 I also have some Christmas for that 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.929
 things and maybe I'll start 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.299
 I'll have a look at it once 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.730
 bought this sweet penguin and indeed 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.080
 this is a candle with vanilla infusion 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.539
 you can almost unscrew her head 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.769
 and one date the candle us direction 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.529
 really very good so i am 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.000
 Anyway, the total fan of vanilla and 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.400
 I've got me but only bought 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.520
 because I find the penguin she and it 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.680
 the candle cost three euros then 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.280
 I still have such a hangover absolutely 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.829
 and that is because I think 24 pieces do 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.469
 So on both sides and they have in 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:46.320
 set 150 cost and that's totally 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.140
 sweet motives on it once the 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.090
 penguin or the polar bear or snowman 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.219
 So even really a big selection 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 and I hope that it will be for everyone 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.070
 gifts will be enough and I think so 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 such little cards are enough too 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.649
 completely on the gift of it 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.410
 close 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.989
 then I got me tesafilm 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.400
 here are two rolls for 150 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.510
 I also want to be quite practical 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.650
 then usually always needs 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.090
 relatively much 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.530
 I'll have that right there 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.540
 I took it with me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.010
 got this set and that is there 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.939
 once four roll wrapping paper 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.600
 finished 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.920
 and 12 grind and I'm fine with that 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.490
 There have also been other ones 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.140
 to dye 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.850
 but I always find it completely 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.970
 fitting and I think so too 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.200
 very cool because you are so different 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.340
 motive but nevertheless it suits him 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.979
 the color together 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.180
 And that would have cost two euros for 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.860
 Finally, I have one more 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.740
 Wrapped roll and that is 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.299
 that this one is just light blue with 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.130
 white snowflakes and that is then 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.570
 hold different christmas motives me 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.640
 find it really sweet hereby, for example 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.409
 with the penguin and we the owl here 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.119
 I think that fits quite well again 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.010
 I think that fits color then stop 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.800
 also with these 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.740
 are you pretty good together and the role 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.880
 has cost 150 yes that was it now 

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.410
 even with the Christmas things 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.940
 then maybe I'll start now 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.530
 with the smaller things and indeed 

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.750
 I have a new statement chain 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.020
 got this from five euros to 2 euros 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.340
 set down and have such a hab 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.899
 I somehow not so with 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:11.450
 I really like the color combination 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:14.000
 here with those gold black and then 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.470
 Stop with the stones here and there 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.760
 I think you can really know such ones 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.530
 very good always too much 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.790
 Attract tops and at two euros 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.200
 Chamber still really does not say there 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.730
 I had to take them there simply 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.160
 then I have my hair still 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.350
 once for 150 these black ones 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.670
 haircuts brought and only 150 of these 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.470
 hair clips I have now synonymous 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.940
 I've already come to palma several times 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.010
 not somehow with the time I have so 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:35.510
 But many hairclips meeting is 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:37.070
 either they are broken or they are 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.110
 just disappear and then I have 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.280
 somehow I'll have 60 pieces on 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.300
 end only two more 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.920
 That's why I actually have now 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.540
 again brought two new because it yes 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.890
 It is always very cheap and me 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.950
 hope they now hold it for now 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:51.290
 a time with me then I have it 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.850
 there are times in private this curls set 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.610
 I usually have this one 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.900
 thin little cares brought for me 

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.130
 believe seven pieces for three euros 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.600
 This time I wanted for the winter 

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.670
 get a few things that is now 

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:04.700
 a threesome set and it has three euros 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.550
 tasted then I have a right 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.890
 Sweetened for backyard and that is 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.300
 such a set had been with bambi and there 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:13.730
 I really could not say no 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.110
 and are on those fluffy pajamas 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.610
 Unfortunately , I think I have 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.170
 also from parma already two different ones 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.300
 I have and also in winter 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.580
 always worn consistently and now with 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.400
 bambi I found so sweet I can 

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:27.260
 Show the pants again 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.720
 This is how the pants look so pink 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.070
 pink with many bambi heads on it 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.720
 So I find the color combination too 

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.519
 really cute and they are like that said 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.890
 fluffy to keep that really warm so 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.870
 I like super happy and has 12 euro 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.660
 that cost 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.970
 then I have a black leggings 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.350
 course that's just this whole 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 normal plain standard leggings 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.280
 This is what Kramer is and now 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.950
 Extra were so then in any case 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:54.470
 to the feet and that has four euros 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.650
 cost now I could not even a 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.700
 a little bit further with 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.070
 standard things that I got myself 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.910
 I once got this top or one 

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.260
 dress 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:03.190
 I'm not sure what 's up 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:06.730
 any case a bit longer in 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:08.560
 brought black I think that has that 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.060
 I tasted 350 I had 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.380
 of it already a few different 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.030
 these talks are also very colorful 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:14.800
 simple, I think they can 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.600
 always quite good simply combined with 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:18.160
 other standard stuff so that one 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:19.390
 The top then pulls down, for example 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.620
 I have these blouses here now 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:22.450
 a pink under because that has yes 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.680
 mostly pretty transparent and 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.790
 that's a bit longer now 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:26.530
 think that find that in winter stop 

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.580
 always good that they are the tops 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.660
 be a bit longer and then you can 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.240
 one more simple one 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:34.600
 top over or sweater and 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.660
 that cost 350, then I have 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.580
 me again a top in black 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.380
 fetched and that is again quite 

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:43.510
 simple and this time with longer ones 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.500
 poor and such tops could you 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.850
 now for example with these longer ones 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.290
 Talk if you combine two now 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.150
 different colors would have is the 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.790
 also stand out a bit in color 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.770
 and you never would have been so alone and block 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:55.990
 the top or you can for example 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.480
 also put on under the sweater if 

00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.729
 you extra warmer a little bit more 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:03.010
 wants to be dressed and it has three euros 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.140
 cost me then I have two more 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.240
 brought a sweater or one 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:09.430
 such a sweater jacket with 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.880
 Zipper in really nice 

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:12.130
 do 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.540
 I just need it in the nova and 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.890
 jackets for work or for example 

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:16.300
 maybe you can go jogging too 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:19.720
 put on or just like that at the apartment 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.580
 where you want to go and this pullover has 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.020
 Eight euros cost exactly as I said 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.620
 here the zipper so you can 

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:29.350
 they also open has also at the 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:30.790
 side pockets and a hood what i got 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.229
 always very practical 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:33.760
 and as I said , you really can 

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:35.350
 combine for everything so you can 

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:37.120
 Too much to make this standard 

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:39.280
 That's why I have then too 

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.630
 taken away and then I have like me 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.280
 said another sweater 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:46.330
 but this time without a zipper 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:48.130
 So in black completely I think so 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.390
 also has eight euro costs exactly here 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:52.540
 with too white ribbon 

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:53.590
 again with a hood and the 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:56.229
 you can also say for the 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.490
 same reasons use here too 

00:05:56.229 --> 00:05:59.020
 again bags so I think so too 

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.250
 quite comfortable if you are just in the 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.080
 Apartment is it is cold 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.569
 you can do that sometimes 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:06.400
 a pull in the winter will find yes then 

00:06:04.569 --> 00:06:08.800
 I now have two more pants 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.099
 found and once a black one 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:13.840
 skinny jeans just show you one 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:16.719
 very black simple skinny jeans 

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:19.599
 she ends up pretty tight down here 

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:21.520
 and that cost 13 euros I need 

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.750
 just hold a new black me 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.979
 think that fits in winter stop too 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.900
 always very good one was actually everything 

00:06:23.979 --> 00:06:27.699
 can combine with it or even to 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.150
 go away or so I think the whole 

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:30.099
 beautiful 

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:32.439
 and then I have me one second 

00:06:30.099 --> 00:06:34.090
 trace of the material now a bit 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:35.770
 firmer like this black one here then me 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.169
 find black of material very thin 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.900
 then it also fits the body 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.759
 somehow ingenious and ever exactly that 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.069
 security costs 17 euro that's just 

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:46.930
 even such a dark jeans looks like that 

00:06:45.069 --> 00:06:50.590
 from behind she just looks like this 

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:51.819
 bit lighter colored and I think 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:53.469
 also ambush so dark and 

00:06:51.819 --> 00:06:55.029
 black jeans fit in somehow 

00:06:53.469 --> 00:06:56.440
 winter or autumn best 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:06:57.580
 and thereby that the material one 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.020
 then a bit thicker is also one 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.770
 a bit warmer and hopefully it too 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:02.770
 stable 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.789
 yes and now 17 euros cost is 

00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:05.289
 which already from my house 

00:07:03.789 --> 00:07:06.789
 maybe it was something for you anyway 

00:07:05.289 --> 00:07:08.560
 There were a lot of bad ones 

00:07:06.789 --> 00:07:10.330
 things but I just needed 

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:12.099
 new winter clothes or something 

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:13.569
 standard stuff maybe you have yes 

00:07:12.099 --> 00:07:15.129
 also the Christmas things fell 

00:07:13.569 --> 00:07:17.770
 in any case they were already pretty 

00:07:15.129 --> 00:07:18.969
 many things there and yes I hope it has 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:22.050
 I like you and I see in mine 

00:07:18.969 --> 00:07:22.050
 next video again then bit
