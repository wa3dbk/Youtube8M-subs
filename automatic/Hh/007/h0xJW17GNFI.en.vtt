fast<00:01:37.439> forward<00:01:37.530> of<00:01:38.390> me<00:01:39.390> duplicating<00:01:40.110> all<00:01:40.290> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
fast forward of me duplicating all of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.340 
fast forward of me duplicating all of
them<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.829> does<00:01:41.509> bypass<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.540> 45<00:01:43.049> minutes

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
them and it does bypass a 45 minutes

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.960 
them and it does bypass a 45 minutes
because<00:01:43.439> again<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:44.009> is<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.340> same<00:01:44.549> exact<00:01:44.909> thing

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
because again it is the same exact thing

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.450 
because again it is the same exact thing
