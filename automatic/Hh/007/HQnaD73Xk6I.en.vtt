means you put the negative right against

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.870 
means you put the negative right against
the<00:02:04.140> paper<00:02:04.350> you<00:02:04.770> expose<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.430> light<00:02:05.520> and

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
the paper you expose it to light and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.660 
the paper you expose it to light and
boom<00:02:06.299> there's<00:02:06.930> no<00:02:07.140> enlarging<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> means

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
boom there's no enlarging so that means

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.550 
boom there's no enlarging so that means
the<00:02:08.819> quality<00:02:09.060> is<00:02:09.360> still<00:02:09.629> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.020> amazing

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
the quality is still going to be amazing

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.710 
the quality is still going to be amazing
because<00:02:11.220> you're<00:02:11.430> not<00:02:11.580> raising<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.270> enlarger

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
because you're not raising the enlarger

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.460 
because you're not raising the enlarger
or<00:02:12.900> crop

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
or crop

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.200 
or crop
or<00:02:13.770> you<00:02:14.400> know<00:02:14.490> cuz<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.850> know<00:02:14.940> how<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.060> get

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
or you know cuz you know how you get

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.760 
or you know cuz you know how you get
make<00:02:15.390> images<00:02:15.630> larger<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.380> the<00:02:16.440> quality

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
make images larger and the quality

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.470 
make images larger and the quality
starts<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> go<00:02:17.220> down<00:02:17.400> well<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.060> same<00:02:18.270> thing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
starts to go down well the same thing

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.060 
starts to go down well the same thing
will<00:02:18.630> happen<00:02:18.660> with<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> negative<00:02:19.380> as<00:02:19.740> you<00:02:19.890> would

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
will happen with a negative as you would

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:21.770 
will happen with a negative as you would
raise<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.520> enlarger<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.150> make<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> image

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
raise the enlarger to make the image

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.780 
raise the enlarger to make the image
bigger<00:02:22.020> the<00:02:22.560> quality<00:02:23.070> would<00:02:23.250> start<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.640> go

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
bigger the quality would start to go

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.850 
bigger the quality would start to go
down<00:02:24.030> but<00:02:24.540> from<00:02:24.840> starting<00:02:25.200> from<00:02:25.320> an<00:02:25.470> 8<00:02:25.650> by<00:02:25.830> 10

here<00:02:40.400> there's<00:02:41.400> these<00:02:41.550> lines<00:02:41.880> on<00:02:42.180> it<00:02:42.210> to<00:02:42.360> help

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
here there's these lines on it to help

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.810 
here there's these lines on it to help
you<00:02:42.600> keep<00:02:42.750> your<00:02:42.810> line<00:02:43.170> straight<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.830> this

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:44.820 
you keep your line straight and this

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:47.210 
you keep your line straight and this
usually<00:02:45.450> you<00:02:45.540> would<00:02:45.660> see<00:02:45.900> guys<00:02:46.140> throw<00:02:46.620> the

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
usually you would see guys throw the

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.060 
usually you would see guys throw the
black<00:02:47.780> like<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:48.810> black<00:02:48.900> sheet<00:02:49.560> over<00:02:49.770> their<00:02:49.920> head

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
black like a black sheet over their head

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.500 
black like a black sheet over their head
so<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.340> they<00:02:50.430> could<00:02:50.580> see<00:02:50.820> what's<00:02:51.060> going<00:02:51.390> on

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
so that they could see what's going on

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.449 
so that they could see what's going on
some<00:02:52.140> people<00:02:52.470> will<00:02:52.590> go<00:02:52.709> in<00:02:52.860> there<00:02:52.980> with<00:02:53.100> a<00:02:53.130> loop

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:53.459 
some people will go in there with a loop

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:55.220 
some people will go in there with a loop
so<00:02:53.730> that<00:02:53.760> they<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.150> loot<00:02:54.360> check<00:02:54.870> it<00:02:55.050> and<00:02:55.170> check

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
so that they can loot check it and check

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.710 
so that they can loot check it and check
their<00:02:55.590> fine<00:02:55.830> focus<00:02:56.220> which<00:02:56.970> is<00:02:57.209> really

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
their fine focus which is really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.270 
their fine focus which is really
important<00:02:58.140> here<00:02:58.290> because<00:02:58.410> you<00:02:58.620> get<00:02:58.770> one<00:02:58.980> shot

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
important here because you get one shot

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.570 
important here because you get one shot
you<00:02:59.459> want<00:02:59.640> to<00:02:59.730> get<00:02:59.850> it<00:02:59.970> right

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:01.580 
you want to get it right

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.360 
you want to get it right
also<00:03:02.580> the<00:03:03.240> image<00:03:03.540> is<00:03:03.660> upside<00:03:03.840> down<00:03:04.080> so<00:03:05.070> there

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
also the image is upside down so there

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.970 
also the image is upside down so there
is<00:03:05.490> no<00:03:05.700> prism<00:03:06.300> this<00:03:06.750> is<00:03:06.900> exactly<00:03:07.410> what<00:03:07.620> happens

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
is no prism this is exactly what happens

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.500 
is no prism this is exactly what happens
when<00:03:08.160> light<00:03:08.400> goes<00:03:08.430> through<00:03:08.670> a<00:03:08.940> lens<00:03:09.209> it's

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
when light goes through a lens it's

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.600 
when light goes through a lens it's
reversed<00:03:10.140> so<00:03:10.680> when<00:03:10.830> you're<00:03:10.950> looking<00:03:11.130> when<00:03:11.580> it

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610 
reversed so when you're looking when it

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.250 
reversed so when you're looking when it
hits<00:03:11.880> your<00:03:12.060> camera's<00:03:12.480> image<00:03:12.510> sensor<00:03:13.050> it's

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260 
hits your camera's image sensor it's

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.280 
hits your camera's image sensor it's
actually<00:03:13.860> being<00:03:14.520> shot<00:03:14.850> like<00:03:15.120> this<00:03:15.450> in<00:03:15.780> the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
actually being shot like this in the

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.810 
actually being shot like this in the
camera<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:16.800> then<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:17.010> just<00:03:17.190> you<00:03:17.400> know<00:03:17.670> it's

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
camera and then it just you know it's

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.330 
camera and then it just you know it's
rotated<00:03:18.510> in<00:03:18.930> the<00:03:19.110> software<00:03:19.470> but<00:03:19.709> it<00:03:19.860> actually

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
rotated in the software but it actually

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.880 
rotated in the software but it actually
comes<00:03:20.519> in<00:03:20.670> upside<00:03:20.970> down<00:03:21.269> like<00:03:21.510> this<00:03:21.769> but<00:03:22.769> the

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
comes in upside down like this but the

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.070 
comes in upside down like this but the
viewfinder<00:03:23.160> is<00:03:23.760> a<00:03:23.790> pendant<00:03:24.180> prism<00:03:24.540> pentaprism

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
viewfinder is a pendant prism pentaprism

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080 
viewfinder is a pendant prism pentaprism
which<00:03:25.440> reverses<00:03:26.280> it<00:03:26.459> for<00:03:26.700> you

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
which reverses it for you

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.360 
which reverses it for you
goes<00:03:27.510> up<00:03:27.720> goes<00:03:27.989> through<00:03:28.290> to<00:03:28.800> make<00:03:28.980> you<00:03:29.130> see

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
goes up goes through to make you see

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.190 
goes up goes through to make you see
exactly<00:03:29.820> what<00:03:30.090> the<00:03:30.209> camera<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.570> seeing<00:03:30.720> to

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
exactly what the camera is seeing to

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.590 
exactly what the camera is seeing to
make<00:03:31.800> you<00:03:31.920> see<00:03:32.280> what<00:03:32.310> you<00:03:32.700> actually<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:33.360> scene

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
make you see what you actually the scene

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.140 
make you see what you actually the scene
is<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:34.470> in<00:03:34.709> this<00:03:34.830> case<00:03:35.070> it's<00:03:35.250> upside<00:03:35.640> down<00:03:35.880> so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
is this in this case it's upside down so

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.690 
is this in this case it's upside down so
let's<00:03:37.140> try<00:03:37.410> to<00:03:37.470> edit<00:03:37.830> this<00:03:37.980> I<00:03:38.190> mean<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.370> really

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:38.700 
let's try to edit this I mean I really

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:39.560 
let's try to edit this I mean I really
like<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.090> because<00:03:39.360> it's<00:03:39.480> a<00:03:39.540> really

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
like this because it's a really

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.630

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:47.489 
to do because it's you know it's a big

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.490 
to do because it's you know it's a big
camera<00:03:47.760> and<00:03:48.030> you<00:03:48.090> have<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.450> you<00:03:48.959> know<00:03:49.080> here<00:03:49.410> it

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
camera and you have to you know here it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.140 
camera and you have to you know here it
is<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.890> have<00:03:50.010> to<00:03:50.130> play<00:03:50.340> with<00:03:50.370> a<00:03:50.549> lot<00:03:50.850> of<00:03:50.910> the

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
is you have to play with a lot of the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.009 
is you have to play with a lot of the
this<00:03:51.840> front<00:03:52.260> area<00:03:52.470> right<00:03:52.799> here<00:03:52.830> tilts<00:03:53.489> forward

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
this front area right here tilts forward

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:56.600 
this front area right here tilts forward
though<00:03:55.019> you<00:03:55.080> it<00:03:55.380> tilts<00:03:55.709> and<00:03:55.860> shifts<00:03:56.280> so<00:03:56.459> it

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
though you it tilts and shifts so it

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.470 
though you it tilts and shifts so it
rotates<00:03:57.209> this<00:03:57.810> way<00:03:58.140> and<00:03:58.820> this<00:03:59.820> way<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.120> the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
rotates this way and this way and the

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.890 
rotates this way and this way and the
back<00:04:00.660> rotates<00:04:01.290> forward<00:04:02.160> it<00:04:02.790> may<00:04:03.000> go<00:04:03.209> it<00:04:03.690> also

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
back rotates forward it may go it also

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.470 
back rotates forward it may go it also
may<00:04:04.140> go<00:04:04.290> side-to-side<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.370> that<00:04:05.820> changes<00:04:06.299> the

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
may go side-to-side and that changes the

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.750 
may go side-to-side and that changes the
perspective<00:04:06.750> of<00:04:07.200> the<00:04:07.320> film<00:04:07.590> and<00:04:07.860> the<00:04:07.920> plane<00:04:08.190> so

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
perspective of the film and the plane so

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.280 
perspective of the film and the plane so
light<00:04:09.000> will<00:04:09.150> hit<00:04:09.269> it<00:04:09.390> a<00:04:09.480> different<00:04:09.810> way<00:04:09.959> so<00:04:10.019> you

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
light will hit it a different way so you

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:11.840 
light will hit it a different way so you
can<00:04:10.410> get<00:04:10.500> some<00:04:10.650> interesting<00:04:10.950> focusing<00:04:11.640> things

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
can get some interesting focusing things

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:13.370 
can get some interesting focusing things
