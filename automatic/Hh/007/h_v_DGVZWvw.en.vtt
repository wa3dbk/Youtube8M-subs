my room
a<00:03:14.630> few<00:03:15.630> days<00:03:15.720> ago<00:03:15.780> like<00:03:16.320> oh<00:03:16.500> there's<00:03:16.769> not<00:03:16.920> one

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
a few days ago like oh there's not one

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.190 
a few days ago like oh there's not one
thing<00:03:17.250> on<00:03:17.430> my<00:03:17.519> wall<00:03:17.700> so<00:03:17.970> I<00:03:18.209> could<00:03:18.720> like<00:03:18.870> plug<00:03:19.079> it

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
thing on my wall so I could like plug it

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.569 
thing on my wall so I could like plug it
into<00:03:19.320> there<00:03:19.530> because<00:03:19.829> the<00:03:19.980> rabbits<00:03:20.310> can't

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
into there because the rabbits can't

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:21.530 
into there because the rabbits can't
reach<00:03:20.880> that

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
reach that

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.390 
reach that
so<00:03:22.500> yeah<00:03:22.590> that'd<00:03:22.739> be<00:03:22.769> really<00:03:22.980> cool<00:03:23.190> if<00:03:23.310> I<00:03:23.370> could

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
so yeah that'd be really cool if I could

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.819 
so yeah that'd be really cool if I could
like<00:03:23.670> hang<00:03:23.940> like<00:03:24.209> Christmas<00:03:24.630> lights<00:03:24.690> up<00:03:25.079> and<00:03:25.470> I

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
like hang like Christmas lights up and I

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:27.590 
like hang like Christmas lights up and I
don't<00:03:25.890> really<00:03:26.100> know<00:03:26.340> what<00:03:26.459> else<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:27.150> just

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
don't really know what else but I just

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.940 
don't really know what else but I just
thought<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.810> would<00:03:27.959> be<00:03:28.049> really<00:03:28.650> fun<00:03:28.920> to

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
thought it would be really fun to

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:32.030 
thought it would be really fun to
decorate<00:03:29.310> for<00:03:29.610> Christmas<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.739> it<00:03:31.739> would<00:03:31.860> just

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
decorate for Christmas and it would just

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.789 
decorate for Christmas and it would just
make<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.459> feel<00:03:32.820> I<00:03:33.269> don't<00:03:33.660> know<00:03:33.870> Christmassy

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
make it feel I don't know Christmassy

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.440 
make it feel I don't know Christmassy
yeah<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.310> that's<00:03:35.489> it<00:03:35.610> for<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:35.880> month's<00:03:36.209> Kate

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:36.450
