00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:07.330 
okay record it now we're good all right

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.959 
okay record it now we're good all right
so<00:00:07.870> first<00:00:08.080> we<00:00:08.380> have<00:00:08.590> the<00:00:08.830> air<00:00:09.370> compressor

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:09.969 
so first we have the air compressor

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.470 
so first we have the air compressor
hooked<00:00:10.179> up<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:11.440> a<00:00:11.469> compression<00:00:12.039> tester<00:00:12.549> in<00:00:12.879> the

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:13.480 
hooked up to a compression tester in the

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.869 
hooked up to a compression tester in the
spark<00:00:14.019> plug<00:00:14.200> socket<00:00:14.339> holding<00:00:15.339> the<00:00:15.429> valves<00:00:15.730> up

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:15.879 
spark plug socket holding the valves up

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:19.160 
spark plug socket holding the valves up
put<00:00:16.690> about<00:00:16.930> a<00:00:16.960> hundred<00:00:17.500> and<00:00:17.530> ten<00:00:17.860> psi<00:00:18.340> in<00:00:18.490> there

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
put about a hundred and ten psi in there

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.090 
put about a hundred and ten psi in there
take<00:00:20.170> the<00:00:20.290> talcum<00:00:20.620> bulb

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
take the talcum bulb

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.450 
take the talcum bulb
put<00:00:21.400> it<00:00:21.520> through<00:00:21.640> the<00:00:21.760> lever<00:00:21.970> screw<00:00:22.960> it<00:00:23.080> into

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
put it through the lever screw it into

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.260 
put it through the lever screw it into
the<00:00:24.460> hole<00:00:24.670> for<00:00:25.450> the<00:00:25.540> rocker<00:00:25.750> arms<00:00:27.030> that<00:00:28.030> allows

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
the hole for the rocker arms that allows

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:30.470 
the hole for the rocker arms that allows
you<00:00:28.450> to<00:00:28.510> press<00:00:28.750> down<00:00:28.930> the<00:00:29.140> valve<00:00:29.320> spring

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
you to press down the valve spring

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.209 
you to press down the valve spring
push<00:00:31.480> it<00:00:31.600> down<00:00:32.020> sometimes<00:00:32.529> you<00:00:32.710> may<00:00:32.890> need<00:00:32.920> to

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:33.219 
push it down sometimes you may need to

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:34.920 
push it down sometimes you may need to
tap<00:00:33.430> the<00:00:33.670> edge<00:00:33.789> with<00:00:34.000> the<00:00:34.030> hammer<00:00:34.300> to<00:00:34.690> get<00:00:34.840> it

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:34.930 
tap the edge with the hammer to get it

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.770 
tap the edge with the hammer to get it
to<00:00:35.020> break<00:00:35.230> free<00:00:35.530> from<00:00:35.559> the<00:00:35.800> valve<00:00:36.010> locks<00:00:36.780> but

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780 
to break free from the valve locks but

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.500 
to break free from the valve locks but
this<00:00:38.079> one<00:00:38.260> was<00:00:38.410> good<00:00:38.640> use<00:00:39.640> a<00:00:39.670> magnet<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.240> pull

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:40.510 
this one was good use a magnet to pull

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.500 
this one was good use a magnet to pull
the<00:00:40.630> valve<00:00:40.810> walks<00:00:41.079> away<00:00:41.400> and<00:00:42.400> release<00:00:45.510> unscrew

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:46.510 
the valve walks away and release unscrew

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:55.650 
the valve walks away and release unscrew
this<00:00:46.690> bolt

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.260 

and<00:00:56.660> the<00:00:56.870> spring<00:00:57.170> just<00:00:57.410> comes<00:00:57.680> off<00:00:58.210> along<00:00:59.210> with

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.270 
and the spring just comes off along with

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:09.130 
and the spring just comes off along with
the<00:00:59.480> retainer

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.770 

now<00:01:09.710> your<00:01:10.010> new<00:01:10.220> spring<00:01:10.430> retainer<00:01:11.360> goes<00:01:11.600> right

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
now your new spring retainer goes right

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.400 
now your new spring retainer goes right
on<00:01:11.900> top<00:01:12.080> again<00:01:13.300> now<00:01:14.300> if<00:01:14.900> you're<00:01:15.020> gonna<00:01:15.140> replace

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.410 
on top again now if you're gonna replace

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.980 
on top again now if you're gonna replace
the<00:01:15.620> valve<00:01:15.860> seals<00:01:16.190> you<00:01:17.180> just<00:01:17.390> pull<00:01:17.630> the<00:01:17.780> valve

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:17.990 
the valve seals you just pull the valve

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.900 
the valve seals you just pull the valve
seal<00:01:18.230> off<00:01:18.470> should<00:01:18.980> come<00:01:19.160> straight<00:01:19.460> up<00:01:19.580> off<00:01:19.760> the

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
seal off should come straight up off the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.090 
seal off should come straight up off the
valve<00:01:20.150> and<00:01:20.420> then<00:01:21.320> when<00:01:21.440> you<00:01:21.500> put<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.800> new<00:01:21.950> one

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
valve and then when you put the new one

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.820 
valve and then when you put the new one
back<00:01:22.130> on<00:01:22.370> put<00:01:23.330> a<00:01:23.360> ten<00:01:23.630> millimeter<00:01:24.020> socket<00:01:24.110> over

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
back on put a ten millimeter socket over

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.490 
back on put a ten millimeter socket over
it<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.100> tap<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:25.880> with<00:01:25.970> a<00:01:26.030> hammer<00:01:26.120> and<00:01:26.660> it'll

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
nice and proper now put the valve spring

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:46.800 
nice and proper now put the valve spring
over<00:01:34.070> there<00:01:36.160> the<00:01:37.160> lever<00:01:37.400> back<00:01:37.640> on<00:01:40.119> rocket-boat

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.399 

the<00:01:47.799> tricky<00:01:48.130> part<00:01:48.340> is<00:01:48.399> the<00:01:48.610> bow<00:01:48.759> box

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the tricky part is the bow box

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.530 
the tricky part is the bow box
push<00:01:50.409> this<00:01:50.590> down<00:01:50.860> make<00:01:51.850> sure<00:01:52.000> it<00:01:52.119> slides<00:01:52.210> over

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
push this down make sure it slides over

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.139 
push this down make sure it slides over
the<00:01:52.689> valve<00:01:52.960> stem<00:01:53.229> nice<00:01:53.470> and<00:01:53.680> smooth<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.149> you
