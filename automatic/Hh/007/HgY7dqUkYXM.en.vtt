the winter every year is to drain the
carburetor<00:00:10.200> float<00:00:10.469> Bowl<00:00:10.830> I'm<00:00:11.639> going<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.000> show

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
carburetor float Bowl I'm going to show

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.709 
carburetor float Bowl I'm going to show
you<00:00:12.210> how<00:00:12.420> to<00:00:12.450> do<00:00:12.690> that<00:00:13.969> the<00:00:14.969> first<00:00:15.210> step<00:00:15.450> to<00:00:15.599> do

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
you how to do that the first step to do

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:20.720 
you how to do that the first step to do
is<00:00:15.960> open<00:00:16.529> the<00:00:16.619> trunk<00:00:16.890> and<00:00:17.869> disconnect<00:00:19.730> the

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
is open the trunk and disconnect the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.480 
is open the trunk and disconnect the
eight<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.240> adapter<00:00:21.810> cord<00:00:22.109> so<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.310> is<00:00:23.460> a

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
eight the adapter cord so so this is a

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.000 
eight the adapter cord so so this is a
cigarette<00:00:23.939> lighter<00:00:24.210> adapter<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:25.289> we<00:00:25.800> just

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
cigarette lighter adapter and we just

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.060 
cigarette lighter adapter and we just
have<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> pull<00:00:26.490> that<00:00:26.640> out<00:00:27.349> and<00:00:28.349> disconnect<00:00:29.160> it

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
have to pull that out and disconnect it

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.950 
have to pull that out and disconnect it
so<00:00:32.070> I've<00:00:32.130> got<00:00:32.309> that<00:00:32.460> disconnected<00:00:33.239> the<00:00:33.719> next

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
so I've got that disconnected the next

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.639 
so I've got that disconnected the next
step<00:00:34.140> is<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.500> remove<00:00:34.710> these<00:00:35.010> five<00:00:35.399> bolts<00:00:36.649> that

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
step is to remove these five bolts that

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.950 
step is to remove these five bolts that
hold<00:00:37.950> the<00:00:38.190> bucket<00:00:38.550> in<00:00:38.730> place<00:00:38.969> so<00:00:39.480> the<00:00:39.570> bucket

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
hold the bucket in place so the bucket

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.810 
hold the bucket in place so the bucket
is<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.260> entire<00:00:40.559> under<00:00:40.920> seed<00:00:41.129> compartment

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
is the entire under seed compartment

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.119 
is the entire under seed compartment
that<00:00:41.910> holds<00:00:41.969> up<00:00:42.360> the<00:00:42.390> seat<00:00:42.860> and<00:00:43.860> then<00:00:43.980> it'll

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
that holds up the seat and then it'll

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.660 
that holds up the seat and then it'll
just<00:00:44.399> lift<00:00:44.640> straight<00:00:44.760> out<00:00:46.340> so<00:00:47.340> I've<00:00:47.399> got<00:00:47.579> the

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
just lift straight out so I've got the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.729 
just lift straight out so I've got the
bolts<00:00:48.030> removed<00:00:48.120> so<00:00:49.079> I'm<00:00:49.170> just<00:00:49.350> going<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.530> lift

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
bolts removed so I'm just going to lift

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:57.279 
bolts removed so I'm just going to lift
the<00:00:49.890> entire<00:00:49.980> assembly<00:00:50.610> straight<00:00:51.390> out<00:00:51.449> know

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.229 

that<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.739> gives<00:00:58.980> access<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.730> engine<00:00:59.910> in

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
that that gives access to the engine in

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.500 
that that gives access to the engine in
the<00:01:00.329> carburetor<00:01:04.580> so<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.670> drain<00:01:05.909> screw<00:01:06.150> to

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the carburetor so the drain screw to

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.660 
the carburetor so the drain screw to
drain<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.900> carburetor<00:01:07.439> is<00:01:07.710> located<00:01:08.280> right<00:01:08.490> to

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
drain the carburetor is located right to

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.420 
drain the carburetor is located right to
the<00:01:08.790> side<00:01:09.060> right<00:01:09.390> down<00:01:09.659> there<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.250> going

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
the side right down there and I'm going

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.010 
the side right down there and I'm going
to<00:01:11.460> put<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> screwdriver<00:01:12.000> on<00:01:12.420> it's<00:01:12.840> kind<00:01:12.990> of

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
to put a screwdriver on it's kind of

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.230 
to put a screwdriver on it's kind of
dark<00:01:13.320> in<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:13.770> not<00:01:14.010> well<00:01:14.280> with<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.549> I'm

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
dark in here not well with it I'm

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.219 
dark in here not well with it I'm
holding<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.689> flashlight<00:01:17.840> put<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> screwdriver

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
holding a flashlight put the screwdriver

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:25.190 
holding a flashlight put the screwdriver
on<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:20.180> start<00:01:21.180> drain

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.230 

so<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:25.860> it's<00:01:26.009> on<00:01:26.159> it's<00:01:26.430> in<00:01:26.580> the<00:01:26.700> screw<00:01:26.939> hole

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
so there it's on it's in the screw hole

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.770 
so there it's on it's in the screw hole
and<00:01:28.110> we'll<00:01:28.259> just<00:01:28.439> loosen<00:01:28.890> it<00:01:29.159> off<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.149 

I've<00:01:37.500> placed<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:38.009> pan<00:01:38.310> under<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.880> engine<00:01:40.159> so

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
I've placed a pan under the engine so

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.080 
I've placed a pan under the engine so
there<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.170> gasoline<00:01:43.799> is<00:01:43.950> draining<00:01:44.280> look

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
now that is drained I'll just tighten

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:16.339 
now that is drained I'll just tighten
the<00:02:04.490> screw<00:02:04.760> up<00:02:04.910> again

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349

little hard to get to but that'll be

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.100 
little hard to get to but that'll be
another<00:02:39.310> app<00:02:39.520> another<00:02:40.120> video<00:02:40.570> I'll<00:02:40.750> be<00:02:40.870> doing
