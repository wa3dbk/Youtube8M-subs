protocol coming from the CDC for nurses

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.100 
protocol coming from the CDC for nurses
or<00:02:18.460> from<00:02:18.670> Washington<00:02:19.180> I<00:02:19.330> want<00:02:19.780> you<00:02:19.840> to<00:02:19.930> take<00:02:20.050> a

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
or from Washington I want you to take a

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.320 
or from Washington I want you to take a
look<00:02:20.350> at<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> states<00:02:21.040> that<00:02:21.340> have<00:02:21.760> enacted

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
look at the states that have enacted

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.810 
look at the states that have enacted
their<00:02:22.690> own<00:02:22.960> Ebola<00:02:23.530> rules<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.250> this<00:02:24.400> graphic

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
their own Ebola rules on this graphic

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.910 
their own Ebola rules on this graphic
behind<00:02:25.150> me<00:02:25.270> here<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.660> think<00:02:26.380> because<00:02:26.680> they're

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
behind me here I think because they're

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.770 
behind me here I think because they're
not<00:02:27.100> getting<00:02:27.550> enough<00:02:27.940> federal<00:02:28.480> guidance

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
not getting enough federal guidance

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.920 
not getting enough federal guidance
would<00:02:29.170> you<00:02:29.320> agree<00:02:29.530> with<00:02:29.590> that<00:02:30.600> well<00:02:31.600> I<00:02:31.630> think

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
would you agree with that well I think

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.410 
would you agree with that well I think
the<00:02:32.290> CDC<00:02:32.950> has<00:02:33.190> been<00:02:33.490> clear<00:02:33.820> about<00:02:34.000> what

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
the CDC has been clear about what

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:36.720 
the CDC has been clear about what
constitutes<00:02:35.190> personal<00:02:36.190> protective

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
constitutes personal protective

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.180 
constitutes personal protective
equipment<00:02:37.170> but<00:02:38.170> again<00:02:38.500> some<00:02:38.920> of<00:02:39.040> the

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:39.190

community<00:02:40.000> hospitals<00:02:40.810> are<00:02:41.080> maybe<00:02:42.010> in<00:02:42.250> denial

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:42.700 
community hospitals are maybe in denial

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.400 
community hospitals are maybe in denial
about<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.390> fact<00:02:43.660> that<00:02:43.780> an<00:02:43.930> Ebola<00:02:44.260> patient

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
about the fact that an Ebola patient

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.290 
about the fact that an Ebola patient
could<00:02:45.100> come<00:02:45.370> through<00:02:45.580> their<00:02:45.760> door<00:02:46.030> and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
could come through their door and

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.840 
could come through their door and
they're<00:02:46.810> not<00:02:46.960> investing<00:02:47.290> the<00:02:47.650> resources<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:48.850 
they're not investing the resources the

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.330 
they're not investing the resources the
major<00:02:49.150> medical<00:02:49.780> facilities<00:02:50.500> these

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
major medical facilities these

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:53.250 
major medical facilities these
facilities<00:02:51.820> seem<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.540> have<00:02:52.660> everything<00:02:52.840> in

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:53.260 
facilities seem to have everything in

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.410 
facilities seem to have everything in
gear<00:02:53.440> they've<00:02:53.650> got<00:02:53.830> Corps<00:02:54.400> volunteer<00:02:55.030> teams

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
gear they've got Corps volunteer teams

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:57.900 
gear they've got Corps volunteer teams
they've<00:02:55.960> got<00:02:56.200> stockpiles<00:02:57.190> of<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> personal

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
they've got stockpiles of the personal

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.790 
they've got stockpiles of the personal

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
and they've got extensive protocols I

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.820 
and they've got extensive protocols I
think<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.580> the<00:03:03.670> smaller<00:03:04.210> facilities<00:03:05.050> where

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:05.830 
think it's the smaller facilities where

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.220 
think it's the smaller facilities where
the<00:03:06.280> nurses<00:03:06.520> are<00:03:06.850> most<00:03:07.090> concerned<00:03:07.300> ok<00:03:07.990> what<00:03:08.170> do

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
the nurses are most concerned ok what do

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.410 
the nurses are most concerned ok what do
you<00:03:08.290> make<00:03:08.410> of<00:03:08.470> the<00:03:08.650> fact<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.070> this<00:03:09.400> nurse<00:03:09.730> who

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420
