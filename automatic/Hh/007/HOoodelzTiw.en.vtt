 asked why there was why we felt 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.720
 romagnoli ours the things we did 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.940

 damage already calling a road a 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.030
 Berlusconi engineers have 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.170
 started waiting for permission to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:56.040
 then proceed with this authorization 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.110
 that we say let's say now the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.810
 pleasure of reading these immense works 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.220
 that must be done quickly that you have it 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.729

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.110

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.530
 privatize 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.480
 but as you wish 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.620
 he is a gentleman who wants to privatize her 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:18.200
 and not only is it the euro most in short 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.959
 so it is, however, also transforms it into a dino 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.390
 sometimes he felt it if the lively there 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.060
 they are of the wedding he said I am able 

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.489
 this is when umberto told me 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.270

 times yes yes yes yes we are silent 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:47.060
 electoral and therefore no one can 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:50.440
 declare or headphones is true we are like 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.330
 says the country the act that is played 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:58.190

00:02:53.330 --> 00:03:02.180
 of the fatherland be heard and true 25 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.069
 million to do that I wanted to say then 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.410
 here is this cagliostro to which 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.130
 umberto ega delicate I was also a 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:11.180
 see the cell this character 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.230
 one extraordinary was able to 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:19.190
 to manipulate the heads of others in short 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.959
 a seducer a lot of women a certain 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.970
 point he declared himself the greatest 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:25.519
 alchemist of the last 150 years 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.370
 there is a little bit he started playing 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:32.239
 on his children he started on his own 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.250
 wife watched and sick at the end 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:36.620
 they put it here at the bottom of the room murat 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.560
 the scene is empty I go to find another 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.870
 music 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:41.870
 we find it the house is empty 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.879
 the state is free for decades 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:54.010
 very well I would like it now that you understand 

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:55.840
 added up that story which replicates of 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.750
 besides also with the niece of luigi xvi 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.150
 in this, the necklace is set up on the register 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.010
 moral at birthday 17 years in front 

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:05.140
 our work is less curd 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.780
 due sum ended up in jail 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:09.610
 then now the cell is empty they have me 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:11.319
 said among other things that here we bossi us 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.900
 then a nuclear power plant appears 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:17.799
 this splitting is the stuff of the state 

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.090
 of the atom really if they lose but 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.739
 this referendum 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.270
 the true split is that of the league 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.010
 a split is a nuclear thing 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.590
 make a secession 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:28.510
 maybe oh well it is that I wanted to say I wanted 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:29.830
 say we came here by the way 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:31.840
 you don't even need to go back to Rome 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:35.050

 beauty out of the normal but we wear 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.539
 lan triumphs this beauty instead of 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.490
 keeping it hidden is something when you do 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:51.130

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.600

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.599
 of the boxes 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:01.599

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.279
 [Applause] 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.640
 let's say I meant to stay nuclear 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:17.070
 from dates many men could be born 

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:21.790
 with 4 grams of heads three televisions 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:24.040
