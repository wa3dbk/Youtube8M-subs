00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.900
 just don't know what is my chalk what is it 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.150

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:14.010
 [music] 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:32.560

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.490

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.140

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.290
 and everyone came up with a reward and I 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.930

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.470
 someone already found the ball but wants to get 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:58.960

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.780
 someone found it and wants a reward 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.110
 in the period but nowhere it must we all 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.510
 Suspiciously this someone said that 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:17.650
 can only trust the bank because 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:21.400

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.160
