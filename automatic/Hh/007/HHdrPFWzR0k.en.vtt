00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
flat long skinny and I thought that was

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:30.920 
flat long skinny and I thought that was
really<00:01:29.729> interesting<00:01:30.329> and<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.479> what<00:01:30.689> drew

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
really interesting and that's what drew

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.420 
really interesting and that's what drew
me<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.079> it<00:01:31.229> but<00:01:32.689> if<00:01:33.689> you<00:01:34.650> look<00:01:34.770> at<00:01:34.920> it<00:01:35.009> beside<00:01:35.280> my

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
me to it but if you look at it beside my

me to it but if you look at it beside my
eye<00:01:35.610> my<00:01:36.210> eye<00:01:36.240> is<00:01:36.450> quite<00:01:36.840> like<00:01:37.020> curvy<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:37.920> find

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
eye my eye is quite like curvy so I find

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:39.980 
eye my eye is quite like curvy so I find
it<00:01:38.490> really<00:01:38.670> difficult<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.270> put<00:01:39.509> this<00:01:39.600> product

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
it really difficult to put this product

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.700 
it really difficult to put this product
actually<00:01:40.740> onto<00:01:41.189> my<00:01:41.579> eyes<00:01:42.049> because<00:01:43.049> if<00:01:43.350> I<00:01:43.470> have

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
actually onto my eyes because if I have

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.530 
actually onto my eyes because if I have
like<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:44.130> bigger<00:01:44.490> brush<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:45.060> feel<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.299> I<00:01:45.420> can

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
like a bigger brush I feel like I can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.600 
like a bigger brush I feel like I can
get<00:01:45.659> all<00:01:45.810> my<00:01:45.840> lashes<00:01:46.259> at<00:01:46.590> once<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.340> because

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
get all my lashes at once but because

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.789 
get all my lashes at once but because
this<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.970> so<00:01:48.119> skinny<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.780> kind<00:01:49.110> of<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.350> I

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
this is so skinny it kind of is like I

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.590 
this is so skinny it kind of is like I
have<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.460> go<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.329> different

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
have to go like a lot of different

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.460 
have to go like a lot of different
angles<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.560> get<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.070> on<00:01:53.250> all<00:01:53.579> of<00:01:53.759> my<00:01:54.200> lashes<00:01:55.200> or

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
angles to get it on all of my lashes or

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.899 
angles to get it on all of my lashes or
something<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.460> think<00:01:56.520> because

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
something like that and I think because

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.749 
something like that and I think because
it's<00:01:57.090> so<00:01:57.240> long<00:01:57.420> it's<00:01:57.719> kind<00:01:57.960> of<00:01:58.049> an<00:01:58.350> awkward<00:01:59.250> way

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
it's so long it's kind of an awkward way

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.399 
it's so long it's kind of an awkward way
to<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.210> on<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.110> doesn't

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to put it on I think it just doesn't

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.859 
to put it on I think it just doesn't
really<00:02:01.619> gel<00:02:01.860> well<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.880> my<00:02:03.060> eye<00:02:03.240> shape<00:02:03.570> it

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
really gel well with my eye shape it

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.230 
really gel well with my eye shape it
would<00:02:03.960> look<00:02:04.229> or<00:02:04.649> it<00:02:05.219> would<00:02:05.369> work<00:02:05.579> better<00:02:05.880> with

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
would look or it would work better with

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.199 
would look or it would work better with
an<00:02:06.360> eye<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.750> was<00:02:06.930> more<00:02:07.580> elongated<00:02:08.580> or<00:02:08.819> flash

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
an eye that was more elongated or flash

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.380 
an eye that was more elongated or flash
or<00:02:09.479> long<00:02:10.140> basically

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
or long basically

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.809 
or long basically
is<00:02:11.569> like<00:02:11.770> you<00:02:12.770> know<00:02:12.860> practically<00:02:13.280> circular

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
is like you know practically circular

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:16.630 
is like you know practically circular
I've<00:02:13.970> really<00:02:14.270> round<00:02:14.480> eyes<00:02:14.660> and<00:02:15.370> yeah<00:02:16.370> so<00:02:16.550> if

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
I've really round eyes and yeah so if

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.040 
I've really round eyes and yeah so if
you<00:02:16.760> have<00:02:16.880> more<00:02:17.060> kind<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.390> round<00:02:17.600> shaped<00:02:17.900> eyes

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
you have more kind of round shaped eyes

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.930 
you have more kind of round shaped eyes
then<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.680> might<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> bit<00:02:19.160> awkward<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.610> use

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
then this might be a bit awkward to use

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.370 
then this might be a bit awkward to use
and<00:02:20.240> and<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:22.220> was<00:02:22.400> kind<00:02:23.209> of<00:02:23.360> interesting<00:02:24.350> to

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
and and it was kind of interesting to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:26.080 
and and it was kind of interesting to
get<00:02:24.590> used<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.980> as<00:02:25.069> well<00:02:25.220> because<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.670> bristles

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
get used to as well because the bristles

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.090 
get used to as well because the bristles
are<00:02:26.240> so<00:02:26.420> soft<00:02:26.720> so<00:02:27.380> they<00:02:27.530> don't<00:02:27.709> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.920> like

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
are so soft so they don't kind of like

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100 
are so soft so they don't kind of like
go<00:02:28.670> through<00:02:28.970> your<00:02:29.150> lashes<00:02:29.330> they<00:02:29.660> kind<00:02:29.900> of<00:02:29.959> like

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
go through your lashes they kind of like

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:32.650 
go through your lashes they kind of like
sit<00:02:30.410> against<00:02:30.740> them<00:02:31.040> as<00:02:31.250> they're<00:02:31.550> like<00:02:31.730> pushing

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
sit against them as they're like pushing

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.750 
sit against them as they're like pushing
it<00:02:32.750> through<00:02:33.050> my<00:02:33.440> eyes<00:02:33.470> tend<00:02:33.950> to<00:02:34.040> water<00:02:34.340> quite<00:02:34.730> a

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
it through my eyes tend to water quite a

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.160 
it through my eyes tend to water quite a
lot<00:02:35.650> especially<00:02:36.650> if<00:02:36.740> I'm<00:02:36.890> yawning<00:02:37.190> or<00:02:37.959> if<00:02:38.959> I'm

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
lot especially if I'm yawning or if I'm

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.390 
lot especially if I'm yawning or if I'm
out<00:02:39.320> in<00:02:39.350> the<00:02:39.530> wind<00:02:39.739> and<00:02:39.950> the<00:02:40.010> wind<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.280> blowing

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
out in the wind and the wind is blowing

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.040 
out in the wind and the wind is blowing
in<00:02:40.640> my<00:02:40.700> eyes<00:02:40.850> or<00:02:41.120> something<00:02:41.450> or<00:02:41.569> if<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.720> get<00:02:41.840> rain

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
in my eyes or something or if I get rain

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:43.210 
in my eyes or something or if I get rain
on<00:02:42.080> my<00:02:42.290> eyes<00:02:42.410> obviously<00:02:42.680> it's<00:02:43.010> going<00:02:43.100> to<00:02:43.160> be

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
on my eyes obviously it's going to be

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.510 
on my eyes obviously it's going to be
water<00:02:43.459> this<00:02:44.180> is<00:02:44.420> not<00:02:45.050> waterproof<00:02:45.590> even<00:02:45.770> in<00:02:46.250> the

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
water this is not waterproof even in the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.880 
water this is not waterproof even in the
slightest<00:02:46.970> bit<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.450> I<00:02:47.600> know<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:48.470> some

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
slightest bit and I know that some

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.259 
slightest bit and I know that some
mascaras<00:02:49.430> even<00:02:49.730> though<00:02:49.820> they<00:02:49.910> don't<00:02:50.090> say

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:50.269 
mascaras even though they don't say

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.810 
mascaras even though they don't say
they're<00:02:50.420> waterproof<00:02:50.900> they<00:02:51.140> will<00:02:51.820> last

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:52.820 
they're waterproof they will last

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.759 
they're waterproof they will last
through<00:02:53.420> a<00:02:53.450> little<00:02:53.930> bit<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.050> tearing<00:02:54.500> up<00:02:54.590> or

00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:54.769 
through a little bit of tearing up or

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:56.290 
through a little bit of tearing up or
something<00:02:55.100> but<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.370> really<00:02:55.670> doesn't<00:02:55.910> it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
something but this really doesn't it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.740 
something but this really doesn't it
kind<00:02:56.540> of<00:02:56.860> melts<00:02:57.860> off<00:02:58.070> straightaway<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.510> ends

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
kind of melts off straightaway and ends

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.830 
kind of melts off straightaway and ends
up<00:02:59.840> as<00:03:00.019> a<00:03:00.050> big<00:03:00.290> smudge<00:03:00.800> on<00:03:01.070> your<00:03:01.100> eyes<00:03:01.630> or<00:03:02.630> at

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
up as a big smudge on your eyes or at

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.180 
up as a big smudge on your eyes or at
least<00:03:03.050> that's<00:03:03.230> what<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.380> did<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.650> me<00:03:03.860> so<00:03:04.070> it

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
least that's what it did to me so it

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.759 
least that's what it did to me so it
absolutely<00:03:04.760> was<00:03:05.540> not<00:03:05.600> good<00:03:06.140> for<00:03:06.530> a<00:03:06.590> long

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
absolutely was not good for a long

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.410 
absolutely was not good for a long
wearing<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:07.340> for<00:03:07.550> that<00:03:07.640> reason<00:03:07.700> I<00:03:08.000> don't<00:03:08.030> wear

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
wearing and for that reason I don't wear

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:09.970 
wearing and for that reason I don't wear
it<00:03:08.450> on<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.840> my<00:03:08.930> eyes<00:03:09.080> because<00:03:09.410> I<00:03:09.620> feel<00:03:09.830> like

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
it on to my eyes because I feel like

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.250 
it on to my eyes because I feel like
it'll<00:03:10.550> just<00:03:10.820> be<00:03:10.910> a<00:03:10.940> huge<00:03:11.390> black<00:03:11.660> mess<00:03:11.930> under

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:12.260 
it'll just be a huge black mess under

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.780 
it'll just be a huge black mess under
there<00:03:12.410> by<00:03:12.560> the<00:03:12.620> end<00:03:12.830> of<00:03:12.920> the<00:03:13.040> day<00:03:13.220> other<00:03:13.580> than

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
there by the end of the day other than

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.250 
there by the end of the day other than
that<00:03:14.060> per<00:03:14.209> wear<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:14.510> this<00:03:14.630> is<00:03:14.750> really<00:03:14.989> good<00:03:15.140> I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
that per wear and this is really good I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.600 
that per wear and this is really good I
didn't<00:03:15.530> notice<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:15.769> flaking<00:03:16.130> or<00:03:16.400> anything

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
didn't notice it flaking or anything

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.520 
didn't notice it flaking or anything
like<00:03:16.880> that<00:03:16.940> but<00:03:17.690> I<00:03:17.720> think<00:03:17.989> it's<00:03:18.140> just<00:03:18.200> because

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
like that but I think it's just because

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.400 
like that but I think it's just because
the<00:03:18.650> formula<00:03:19.040> is<00:03:19.070> so<00:03:19.370> wet<00:03:20.030> but<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.989> just<00:03:21.170> tends

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:21.410 
the formula is so wet but it just tends

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:23.259 
the formula is so wet but it just tends
to<00:03:21.530> kind<00:03:21.799> of<00:03:21.829> dissolve<00:03:22.220> really<00:03:22.700> easily<00:03:23.150> or

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
to kind of dissolve really easily or

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:24.850 
to kind of dissolve really easily or
something<00:03:23.690> it<00:03:23.810> does<00:03:23.989> sting<00:03:24.320> if<00:03:24.470> you<00:03:24.560> get<00:03:24.739> this
