00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 0 the ball and welcome to 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.020
 a child spotlight from the test servers 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 and it is so brave 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.290
 mid 90s left in the nineties with the 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.730
 name rieter has something of an undead 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.740
 as we can see 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.199
 also her before she bit like 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.490
 vladimir multi I think there comes 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.630
 equal to and have the comparison 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.010
 between the classic unicorn 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.420
 paramedic and the new ripper skin 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.750
 we'll look at the errors first 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:35.280
 animation with control 1 there swing 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.020
 she sure something forward 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.300
 shakes his head but that's it 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:42.660
 in the classical skin differently also the 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.190
 tank or 2 is equal to the dance we have 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.320
 just seen for welcome 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:51.000
 is an Egyptian monitor on everyone 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.890
 no chest change on the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.850
 laugh is completely the same again the 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.640
 ability 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.600
 kyu often looks different and if the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:10.210
 cure then arrives 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:13.369
 a bit bleak as I think so too 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.049
 something like that all very spooky 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.210
 kept even if the cure arrives 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:21.049
 At the ak, I see it all 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.700
 more divine from her healing now 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:24.229
 Unfortunately, do not test what that looks like 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.039
 but I suspect that we will too 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:30.409
 instead of a green then more shimmers 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:35.240
 spooky gray blue or something like that 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:40.009
 her soil that has long been seen so too 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:42.200
 the cage petit later looks blue blue 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.649
 everything needs ghostly spooky 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.100
 I find a bit of transparency and the 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.460
 ultima okay so is therefore also beyond 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.350
 see 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:58.130
 Here's the yellow green and here 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:02:00.170
 the blue looks low again everything 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.450
 blue yellow green 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.069
 that is, we have the club 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.770
 Now let's have a look at the reanimation 

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:08.720
 That beats you with the safe ground 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.090
 and even a rip arises and here 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.780
 it is somehow divine and she flies 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.860
 in the sky now every year with it 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.510
 we still watch how the tools use 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:19.459
 looks and overall the child will 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.959
 probably cost 1350 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.570
 the animation is not such 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.519
 but changes the skills as well as the 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:27.709
 look so the optics is different if 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.780
 she dies with her stomach 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.790
 but apparently I think that's not 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:33.680
 great animation nobody should celebrate 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.570
 we are the next time the new 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.799
 skins natural as you with me thanks 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.799
 for watching is
