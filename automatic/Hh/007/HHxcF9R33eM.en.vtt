damaging skill at the moment so make
sure<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.050> hit<00:00:40.290> that<00:00:40.320> skill<00:00:40.710> and<00:00:40.950> then<00:00:41.430> second

sure to hit that skill and then second

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.369 
sure to hit that skill and then second
off<00:00:41.850> you're<00:00:42.000> going<00:00:42.090> to<00:00:42.180> make<00:00:42.270> so<00:00:42.450> Q<00:00:42.809> even

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
off you're going to make so Q even

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.020 
off you're going to make so Q even
though<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> does<00:00:43.739> still<00:00:43.950> give<00:00:44.160> 25<00:00:44.550> base<00:00:44.820> damage

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
though it does still give 25 base damage

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.639 
though it does still give 25 base damage
per<00:00:45.360> level<00:00:45.539> it's<00:00:46.050> still<00:00:46.200> going<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.410> be<00:00:46.469> your

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
per level it's still going to be your

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
per level it's still going to be your
number<00:00:46.860> one<00:00:46.890> tool<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.430> damage<00:00:47.760> as<00:00:47.969> your<00:00:48.450> leap

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
number one tool for damage as your leap

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.630 
number one tool for damage as your leap
is<00:00:48.750> all<00:00:48.899> utility<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.620> now<00:00:50.250> I<00:00:50.280> think<00:00:50.460> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
is all utility and now I think the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.860 
is all utility and now I think the
biggest<00:00:50.820> question<00:00:51.239> that<00:00:51.270> everyone<00:00:51.600> wants

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
biggest question that everyone wants

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.569 
biggest question that everyone wants
answered<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> hell<00:00:52.949> do<00:00:53.100> i<00:00:53.190> evolved

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
answered is what the hell do i evolved

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.520 
answered is what the hell do i evolved
all<00:00:54.120> right<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.390> what<00:00:54.539> I'm<00:00:54.660> thinking<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.140> I<00:00:55.379> get

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
all right so what I'm thinking is I get

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.470 
all right so what I'm thinking is I get
the<00:00:55.649> Q<00:00:55.890> evolution<00:00:56.370> first<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:57.059> reason<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.360> get

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the Q evolution first the reason I get

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.479 
the Q evolution first the reason I get
the<00:00:57.600> Q<00:00:57.809> evolution<00:00:58.260> first<00:00:58.500> is<00:00:58.680> because<00:00:58.859> the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
the Q evolution first is because the

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.700 
the Q evolution first is because the
evolution<00:01:00.000> Q's<00:01:00.329> damage<00:01:00.750> is<00:01:00.960> based<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.260> casters

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
evolution Q's damage is based on casters

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.619 
evolution Q's damage is based on casters
level<00:01:02.070> so<00:01:02.460> it's<00:01:02.609> actually<00:01:02.699> unaffected<00:01:03.390> by<00:01:03.510> how

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
level so it's actually unaffected by how

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.329 
level so it's actually unaffected by how
much<00:01:03.750> point<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.110> put<00:01:04.229> at<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.439> Q<00:01:04.650> and<00:01:04.860> this

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
much point you put at the Q and this

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
much point you put at the Q and this
helps<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.700> doing<00:01:05.909> camps<00:01:06.210> faster<00:01:06.600> and<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
helps on doing camps faster and of

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.750 
helps on doing camps faster and of
course<00:01:07.140> those<00:01:07.409> isolations<00:01:07.950> scenarios<00:01:08.610> where

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
course those isolations scenarios where

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.190 
course those isolations scenarios where
you<00:01:08.820> can<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.060> a<00:01:09.090> lot<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.330> jungler<00:01:09.750> or<00:01:09.900> someone

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
you can do a lot of jungler or someone

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.289 
you can do a lot of jungler or someone
in<00:01:10.290> a<00:01:10.380> 1v1<00:01:10.710> it<00:01:11.340> also<00:01:11.490> helps<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:11.939> good<00:01:12.150> on

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
in a 1v1 it also helps pretty good on

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.300 
in a 1v1 it also helps pretty good on
sewing<00:01:12.750> dragon<00:01:12.900> by<00:01:13.170> yourself<00:01:13.560> or<00:01:13.770> in<00:01:14.189> general

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
sewing dragon by yourself or in general

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.310 
sewing dragon by yourself or in general
isolated<00:01:14.970> creeps<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.930> think<00:01:16.049> it's<00:01:16.229> really

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
isolated creeps so I think it's really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.140 
isolated creeps so I think it's really
helpful<00:01:16.770> especially<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.340> solo<00:01:17.640> q<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
helpful especially for solo q the

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.670 
helpful especially for solo q the
secondary<00:01:18.570> choice<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.200> course<00:01:19.380> getting

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
secondary choice is of course getting

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.410 
secondary choice is of course getting
our<00:01:19.979> but<00:01:20.460> you're<00:01:20.640> actually<00:01:20.729> missing<00:01:21.150> out<00:01:21.240> on<00:01:21.270> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
our but you're actually missing out on a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:22.910 
our but you're actually missing out on a
lot<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.600> potential<00:01:21.960> that<00:01:22.170> Kazakhs<00:01:22.560> can<00:01:22.710> have

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
lot of potential that Kazakhs can have

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.249 
lot of potential that Kazakhs can have
with<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.340> evolved<00:01:23.729> Q&amp;As<00:01:24.270> right<00:01:24.780> now<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.110> is

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
with is evolved Q&amp;As right now that is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.510 
with is evolved Q&amp;As right now that is
one<00:01:25.409> of<00:01:25.530> his<00:01:25.650> core<00:01:25.950> strengths<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:26.400> to

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
one of his core strengths is to

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.120 
one of his core strengths is to
isolation<00:01:26.970> targets<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.439> level<00:01:28.680> 11<00:01:29.009> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
isolation targets and that level 11 you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.920 
isolation targets and that level 11 you
do<00:01:29.250> get<00:01:29.369> the<00:01:29.490> leap<00:01:29.700> evolution<00:01:30.329> it<00:01:30.570> hasn't

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
do get the leap evolution it hasn't

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.240 
do get the leap evolution it hasn't
changed<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.470> still<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.890> most<00:01:32.009> useful

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
changed and it's still the most useful

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
changed and it's still the most useful
for<00:01:32.520> team<00:01:32.700> fights<00:01:32.939> and<00:01:33.210> then<00:01:33.630> at<00:01:33.750> level<00:01:33.990> 16<00:01:34.409> do

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
for team fights and then at level 16 do

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.319 
for team fights and then at level 16 do
you<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> W<00:01:35.189> evolution<00:01:35.700> or<00:01:35.820> to<00:01:35.939> get<00:01:36.060> to<00:01:36.150> our

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
you get the W evolution or to get to our

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.569 
you get the W evolution or to get to our
evolution<00:01:36.930> so<00:01:37.500> the<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.799> I<00:01:37.860> see<00:01:38.009> it<00:01:38.280> w

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
evolution so the way I see it w

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.490 
evolution so the way I see it w
evolution<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.210> still<00:01:39.420> useless<00:01:39.840> if<00:01:40.380> you're

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
evolution is still useless if you're

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.109 
evolution is still useless if you're
planning<00:01:40.829> on<00:01:40.890> poking<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.369> enemy<00:01:41.700> down<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
planning on poking the enemy down to

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.510 
planning on poking the enemy down to
death<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.840> it's<00:01:43.140> fine<00:01:43.350> but<00:01:43.950> fifty<00:01:44.340> percent

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
death sure it's fine but fifty percent

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
death sure it's fine but fifty percent
slow<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.180> grant<00:01:45.509> vision<00:01:45.869> of<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.049> enemy<00:01:46.409> it

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
slow and grant vision of the enemy it

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
slow and grant vision of the enemy it
doesn't<00:01:47.159> really<00:01:47.280> give<00:01:47.640> me<00:01:47.820> an<00:01:48.030> impression

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
doesn't really give me an impression

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.569 
doesn't really give me an impression
that<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.689> should<00:01:48.930> get<00:01:49.049> it<00:01:49.229> so<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.770> do<00:01:49.920> go<00:01:50.159> with<00:01:50.369> are

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
that I should get it so I do go with are

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.399 
that I should get it so I do go with are
at<00:01:50.729> level<00:01:50.820> 16<00:01:51.329> even<00:01:51.960> though<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.110> damage

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
at level 16 even though the damage

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.170 
at level 16 even though the damage
reduction<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.890> gone<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> utility<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.939> still

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
reduction is gone the utility is still

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.940 
reduction is gone the utility is still
there<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.990> you<00:01:55.079> get<00:01:55.259> sick<00:01:55.470> seconds<00:01:55.799> of

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
there as if you get sick seconds of

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.289 
there as if you get sick seconds of
stealth<00:01:56.219> plus<00:01:56.490> increased<00:01:56.909> movement<00:01:57.060> speed

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
stealth plus increased movement speed

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.209 
stealth plus increased movement speed
and<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:57.960> feel<00:01:58.140> that's<00:01:58.259> more<00:01:58.469> useful<00:01:58.770> than<00:01:58.829> fifty

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
and I feel that's more useful than fifty

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.310 
and I feel that's more useful than fifty
percent<00:01:59.490> slow<00:01:59.820> plus<00:02:00.090> granted<00:02:00.540> vision<00:02:00.869> alright

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
percent slow plus granted vision alright

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.810 
percent slow plus granted vision alright
so<00:02:01.409> next<00:02:01.560> off<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:01.950> what<00:02:02.130> kind<00:02:02.280> of<00:02:02.340> build<00:02:02.610> do<00:02:02.759> I

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
so next off is what kind of build do I

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.910 
so next off is what kind of build do I
go<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.479> know<00:02:03.600> the<00:02:03.780> tanky<00:02:04.110> Kazakhs<00:02:04.530> randuin's

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
go you know the tanky Kazakhs randuin's

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.910 
go you know the tanky Kazakhs randuin's
and<00:02:05.280> cheese<00:02:05.520> etc<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:06.450> think<00:02:07.140> that's<00:02:07.320> gone<00:02:07.680> right

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
and cheese etc I think that's gone right

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.680 
and cheese etc I think that's gone right
now<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:08.940> he<00:02:09.030> doesn't<00:02:09.179> have<00:02:09.300> high

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
now just because he doesn't have high

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.210 
now just because he doesn't have high
a<00:02:09.720> sandwich<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.530> contribute<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.100> his

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
a sandwich to contribute for his

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.460 
a sandwich to contribute for his
tankiness<00:02:11.700> so<00:02:12.240> what<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:12.810> from<00:02:12.930> here<00:02:13.170> is<00:02:13.320> now

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
tankiness so what I see from here is now

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:15.650 
tankiness so what I see from here is now
basically<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:14.160> full<00:02:14.460> glass<00:02:14.730> canning<00:02:15.150> you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
basically going full glass canning you

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.060 
basically going full glass canning you
know<00:02:15.750> how<00:02:15.870> the<00:02:15.930> old<00:02:16.140> Catholics<00:02:16.590> used<00:02:16.740> to<00:02:16.860> work

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
know how the old Catholics used to work

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:18.920 
know how the old Catholics used to work
was<00:02:17.370> where<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.880> get<00:02:18.120> tire<00:02:18.390> mad<00:02:18.690> and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
was where you get tire mad and

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.080 
was where you get tire mad and
brutalizes<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.740> last<00:02:19.950> whisper<00:02:20.190> you<00:02:20.970> know

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
brutalizes and last whisper you know

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.730 
brutalizes and last whisper you know
going<00:02:21.300> for<00:02:21.480> that<00:02:21.600> first<00:02:21.810> vote<00:02:22.080> we<00:02:22.260> jumped<00:02:22.620> in

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
going for that first vote we jumped in

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:24.320 
going for that first vote we jumped in
and<00:02:22.920> out<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.370> feel<00:02:23.640> that's<00:02:23.790> the<00:02:23.970> only<00:02:24.180> way<00:02:24.270> to

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
and out I feel that's the only way to

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.480 
and out I feel that's the only way to
build<00:02:24.540> them<00:02:24.720> now<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.110> yeah<00:02:25.620> full<00:02:25.980> assassin

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
build them now and yeah full assassin

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.220 
build them now and yeah full assassin
class<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.240> Kazakhs<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.840> way<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:27.990> go

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
class can and Kazakhs is the way to go

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.420 
class can and Kazakhs is the way to go
and<00:02:28.530> it<00:02:28.770> probably<00:02:28.800> goes<00:02:29.130> something<00:02:29.400> like

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
and it probably goes something like

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.130 
and it probably goes something like
guardian<00:02:29.940> angel<00:02:30.210> as<00:02:30.330> my<00:02:30.450> six<00:02:30.690> item<00:02:30.930> for<00:02:31.080> the

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
guardian angel as my six item for the

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:32.930 
guardian angel as my six item for the
defense<00:02:31.440> by<00:02:31.650> them<00:02:31.860> alright<00:02:32.430> so<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.730> teamfights

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
defense by them alright so in teamfights

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.550 
defense by them alright so in teamfights
what<00:02:33.300> do<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.480> kind<00:02:33.720> of<00:02:33.780> have<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> mind<00:02:34.260> set<00:02:34.440> up

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
what do I kind of have the mind set up

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.560 
what do I kind of have the mind set up
so<00:02:35.010> before<00:02:35.220> with<00:02:35.490> the<00:02:35.580> tanky<00:02:35.910> guys<00:02:36.090> he<00:02:36.450> was

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
so before with the tanky guys he was

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.540 
so before with the tanky guys he was
kind<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.870> like<00:02:37.080> he<00:02:37.380> jumps<00:02:37.710> in<00:02:37.860> and<00:02:38.100> initiates

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
kind of like he jumps in and initiates

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:40.280 
kind of like he jumps in and initiates
the<00:02:38.640> fight<00:02:38.940> but<00:02:39.570> now<00:02:39.780> you<00:02:39.840> got<00:02:40.110> to<00:02:40.200> be<00:02:40.260> more

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the fight but now you got to be more

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.770 
the fight but now you got to be more
careful<00:02:40.500> than<00:02:41.070> be<00:02:41.280> an<00:02:41.430> assassin<00:02:41.700> take<00:02:42.480> people

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
careful than be an assassin take people

fighting<00:03:34.260> with<00:03:34.470> this<00:03:34.590> cast<00:03:34.830> is<00:03:35.040> pretty<00:03:35.340> shitty

unless you can find isolated targets
that's<00:03:37.830> why<00:03:37.950> I<00:03:37.980> feel<00:03:38.190> he's<00:03:38.340> more<00:03:38.519> suited<00:03:38.670> to

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
that's why I feel he's more suited to

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:40.340 
that's why I feel he's more suited to
split<00:03:39.120> pushing<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.570> 1d<00:03:39.840> wanting<00:03:40.140> other

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
still the same you know more enemies are

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:49.430 
still the same you know more enemies are
isolated<00:03:48.420> so<00:03:48.870> that<00:03:49.019> maybe<00:03:49.140> there's<00:03:49.410> more

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
isolated so that maybe there's more

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:50.900 
isolated so that maybe there's more
damage<00:03:49.890> when<00:03:50.070> when<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.400> wanting<00:03:50.700> someone

ganking someone who's isolated and then

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:54.830 
ganking someone who's isolated and then
when<00:03:53.010> comes<00:03:53.190> the<00:03:53.280> mid<00:03:53.519> game<00:03:53.760> he<00:03:54.209> is<00:03:54.420> complete

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
when comes the mid game he is complete

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.650

damage is walking if you cannot find an
isolated<00:04:00.450> target<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:01.140> that<00:04:01.170> can<00:04:01.620> be<00:04:01.830> bad<00:04:02.100> and

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
isolated target so that can be bad and

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.430 
isolated target so that can be bad and
its<00:04:02.820> best<00:04:03.000> bet<00:04:03.269> is<00:04:03.480> either<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.840> split<00:04:04.050> push<00:04:04.260> or

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
its best bet is either to split push or

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.229 
its best bet is either to split push or
