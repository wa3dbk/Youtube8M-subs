big sort of section of stitches that we

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020 
big sort of section of stitches that we
then<00:00:45.989> draw<00:00:46.230> together<00:00:46.440> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.890> top<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> that

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
then draw together at the top and that

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.690 
then draw together at the top and that
makes<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.600> puff<00:00:48.870> out<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:50.039> this<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.550> not

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
makes them puff out now this is not

subtle texture that has sort of an

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.139 
subtle texture that has sort of an
interesting<00:01:01.020> look<00:01:01.489> to<00:01:02.489> it<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.789> let's<00:01:02.940> show<00:01:03.120> you

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
interesting look to it so let's show you

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.990 
interesting look to it so let's show you
how<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:04.379> works<00:01:04.650> for<00:01:05.040> step<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.610> we're<00:01:05.880> going

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
how this works for step one we're going

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.140 
how this works for step one we're going
to<00:01:06.240> yarn<00:01:06.600> over<00:01:06.830> insert<00:01:07.830> our<00:01:08.220> hook<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.640> draw

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
to yarn over insert our hook and draw

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.429 
to yarn over insert our hook and draw
through<00:01:10.159> the<00:01:11.159> yarn<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:12.060> we<00:01:12.360> want<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.659> draw

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
through the yarn and we want to draw

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.219 
through the yarn and we want to draw
this<00:01:13.650> up<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:14.280> little<00:01:14.549> bit<00:01:14.729> higher<00:01:15.420> because<00:01:15.840> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
this up a little bit higher because the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.539 
this up a little bit higher because the
more<00:01:16.409> we<00:01:16.530> do<00:01:16.680> this<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> more<00:01:17.220> it's<00:01:17.369> going<00:01:17.460> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
more we do this the more it's going to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.640 
more we do this the more it's going to
want<00:01:17.700> to<00:01:17.759> pull<00:01:18.060> down<00:01:18.330> okay<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:18.780> go<00:01:19.500> ahead<00:01:19.560> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
want to pull down okay so go ahead and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.510 
want to pull down okay so go ahead and
just<00:01:20.210> pull<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.420> up<00:01:21.630> with<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.320> hook<00:01:22.680> as<00:01:22.920> you

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
just pull this up with your hook as you

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.179 
just pull this up with your hook as you
go<00:01:23.640> along<00:01:23.790> each<00:01:24.210> time<00:01:24.619> for<00:01:25.619> step<00:01:25.799> two<00:01:26.009> we're

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
go along each time for step two we're

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.190 
go along each time for step two we're
gonna<00:01:26.280> repeat<00:01:26.700> this<00:01:26.880> so<00:01:27.060> yarn<00:01:27.299> over<00:01:27.479> insert

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
gonna repeat this so yarn over insert

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.219 
gonna repeat this so yarn over insert
our<00:01:28.590> hook<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:28.979> draw<00:01:29.490> through<00:01:29.880> and<00:01:30.329> that's

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
our hook and draw through and that's

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.020 
our hook and draw through and that's
going<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.500> leave<00:01:31.680> us<00:01:31.829> with<00:01:31.860> four<00:01:32.460> loops<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.850> our

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
going to leave us with four loops on our

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.039 
going to leave us with four loops on our
hook<00:01:33.560> these<00:01:34.560> first<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.369> sets<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.119> loops<00:01:36.420> one

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
hook these first two sets of loops one

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.340 
hook these first two sets of loops one
two<00:01:37.259> and<00:01:37.590> one<00:01:37.770> two<00:01:37.829> are<00:01:38.700> each<00:01:39.030> what<00:01:39.960> would<00:01:40.110> be<00:01:40.320> a

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
two and one two are each what would be a

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.950 
two and one two are each what would be a
half<00:01:40.740> double<00:01:41.040> crochet<00:01:41.570> the<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.840> that

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
half double crochet the thing is that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.389 
half double crochet the thing is that
we're<00:01:43.110> not<00:01:43.200> completing<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.920> half<00:01:44.070> double

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
we're not completing the half double

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.510 
we're not completing the half double
crochet<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:45.479> would<00:01:45.780> work<00:01:46.680> like<00:01:46.979> this<00:01:47.250> we

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
crochet which would work like this we

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100 
crochet which would work like this we
have<00:01:47.670> three<00:01:48.000> loops<00:01:48.149> on<00:01:48.360> our<00:01:48.420> hook<00:01:48.540> yarn<00:01:48.930> over

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
have three loops on our hook yarn over

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.440 
have three loops on our hook yarn over
and<00:01:49.259> draw<00:01:49.409> through<00:01:49.530> all<00:01:49.770> three<00:01:50.250> right<00:01:51.240> when

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
and draw through all three right when

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.350 
and draw through all three right when
we're<00:01:51.570> doing<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.930> together<00:01:52.970> we<00:01:53.970> would<00:01:54.210> only

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
we're doing this together we would only

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.240 
we're doing this together we would only
complete<00:01:54.869> half<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.409> stitch<00:01:55.649> but<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.130> this

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
complete half the stitch but in this

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.980 
complete half the stitch but in this
case<00:01:56.490> half<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.090> stitches<00:01:57.439> three<00:01:58.439> loops<00:01:58.909> so

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
case half the stitches three loops so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.300 
case half the stitches three loops so
for<00:02:00.990> each<00:02:01.140> additional<00:02:01.530> stitch<00:02:02.009> we'll<00:02:02.189> be

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
for each additional stitch we'll be

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.520 
for each additional stitch we'll be
adding<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.820> more<00:02:03.030> loops<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:03.750> again<00:02:04.110> was

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
adding two more loops so this again was

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.550 
adding two more loops so this again was
step<00:02:04.890> two<00:02:05.219> and<00:02:05.689> then<00:02:06.689> we'll<00:02:06.840> do<00:02:06.990> step<00:02:07.259> three

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
step two and then we'll do step three

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.339 
step two and then we'll do step three
which<00:02:07.799> is<00:02:08.119> number<00:02:09.119> three<00:02:09.629> okay<00:02:10.319> now<00:02:10.649> we've<00:02:10.800> got

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
which is number three okay now we've got

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.229 
which is number three okay now we've got
seven<00:02:13.349> loops

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
seven loops

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:17.240 
seven loops
step<00:02:15.239> four<00:02:15.599> will<00:02:15.959> be<00:02:16.140> the<00:02:16.170> fourth<00:02:16.830> one<00:02:17.099> and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
step four will be the fourth one and

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.820 
step four will be the fourth one and
that<00:02:17.879> gives<00:02:18.120> us<00:02:18.269> nine<00:02:18.510> loops<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.170> Step<00:02:19.410> five

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
that gives us nine loops and Step five

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.710 
that gives us nine loops and Step five
is<00:02:20.780> our<00:02:21.780> fifth<00:02:22.319> half<00:02:22.620> double<00:02:23.010> crochet<00:02:23.430> or<00:02:23.720> what

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
is our fifth half double crochet or what

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.360 
is our fifth half double crochet or what
would<00:02:24.930> be<00:02:24.959> our<00:02:25.230> fifth<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.800> we<00:02:25.980> can<00:02:26.099> see<00:02:26.250> how

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
would be our fifth and we can see how

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.250 
would be our fifth and we can see how
this<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.670> tightened<00:02:27.090> down<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.300> lot<00:02:27.629> further<00:02:27.930> now

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
this is tightened down a lot further now

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.720 
this is tightened down a lot further now
even<00:02:28.530> though<00:02:28.620> we've<00:02:28.800> stretched<00:02:29.129> out<00:02:29.370> each

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
even though we've stretched out each

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.559 
even though we've stretched out each
time<00:02:30.530> so<00:02:31.530> now<00:02:32.310> we've<00:02:32.550> got<00:02:32.730> eleven<00:02:33.209> loops<00:02:33.390> on

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
time so now we've got eleven loops on

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.660 
time so now we've got eleven loops on
our<00:02:33.599> hook<00:02:33.720> for<00:02:34.650> step<00:02:34.860> six<00:02:34.890> we're<00:02:35.489> going<00:02:35.610> to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
our hook for step six we're going to

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.710 
our hook for step six we're going to
yarn<00:02:35.880> over<00:02:36.000> and<00:02:36.269> we're<00:02:36.360> going<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.510> draw

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
yarn over and we're going to draw

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.920 
yarn over and we're going to draw
through<00:02:36.959> all<00:02:37.200> eleven<00:02:37.980> loops<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.580> once<00:02:39.209> now<00:02:39.870> the

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
through all eleven loops at once now the

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.150 
through all eleven loops at once now the
other<00:02:40.170> reason<00:02:40.290> why<00:02:40.440> we<00:02:40.470> want<00:02:40.739> to<00:02:40.830> stretch

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
other reason why we want to stretch

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.490 
other reason why we want to stretch
those<00:02:41.519> loops<00:02:42.030> out<00:02:42.209> each<00:02:42.599> time<00:02:42.930> is<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.379> make

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
those loops out each time is to make

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.170 
those loops out each time is to make
that<00:02:43.650> easier<00:02:44.069> to<00:02:44.220> pull<00:02:44.430> through<00:02:44.670> all<00:02:44.849> at<00:02:45.060> the

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
that easier to pull through all at the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.479 
that easier to pull through all at the
end<00:02:45.470> now<00:02:46.470> for<00:02:46.650> step<00:02:46.799> seven<00:02:47.250> we're<00:02:47.400> gonna

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
end now for step seven we're gonna

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.660 
end now for step seven we're gonna
finish<00:02:47.910> up<00:02:48.209> by<00:02:48.510> yarning<00:02:49.110> over<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.670> drawing

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
finish up by yarning over and drawing

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.030 
finish up by yarning over and drawing
the<00:02:50.910> yarn<00:02:51.150> through<00:02:51.660> this<00:02:52.230> loop<00:02:52.500> on<00:02:52.680> our<00:02:52.799> hook

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
the yarn through this loop on our hook

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.009 
the yarn through this loop on our hook
that's<00:02:53.250> going<00:02:53.340> to<00:02:53.549> secure<00:02:53.730> those<00:02:54.180> all

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
that's going to secure those all

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.350 
that's going to secure those all
together<00:02:55.470> okay<00:02:56.340> so<00:02:56.400> let's<00:02:56.670> do<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:56.940> again<00:02:57.209> I'm

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
together okay so let's do this again I'm

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.809 
together okay so let's do this again I'm
gonna<00:02:57.930> work<00:02:58.739> in<00:02:58.920> pattern<00:02:59.250> for<00:02:59.459> a<00:02:59.489> second

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
gonna work in pattern for a second

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:09.020 
gonna work in pattern for a second
across<00:03:00.090> here<00:03:06.950> this<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.130> very<00:03:08.430> easy<00:03:08.640> and<00:03:09.000> you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
across here this is very easy and you

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.059 
across here this is very easy and you
don't<00:03:09.480> have<00:03:09.660> to<00:03:09.810> do<00:03:09.959> this<00:03:10.110> with<00:03:10.349> five<00:03:10.650> sets<00:03:10.950> you

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
don't have to do this with five sets you

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.550 
don't have to do this with five sets you
could<00:03:11.220> do<00:03:11.370> this<00:03:11.549> with<00:03:11.819> a<00:03:12.480> half<00:03:12.870> double<00:03:13.110> crochet

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
could do this with a half double crochet

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.220 
could do this with a half double crochet
three<00:03:13.950> or<00:03:14.280> four<00:03:14.579> together<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:15.720> really<00:03:16.079> just

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
three or four together it really just

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.110 
three or four together it really just
depends<00:03:16.530> on<00:03:16.650> how<00:03:16.769> big<00:03:17.099> you<00:03:17.310> want<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.700> bobble

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
depends on how big you want the bobble

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.949 
depends on how big you want the bobble
to<00:03:18.930> be<00:03:21.709> okay<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:23.150> again<00:03:24.150> we're<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.329> a<00:03:24.420> yarn<00:03:24.660> over

00:03:24.949 --> 00:03:24.959 
to be okay so again we're in a yarn over

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:27.620 
to be okay so again we're in a yarn over
insert<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:26.340> draw<00:03:26.519> through<00:03:26.880> we've<00:03:27.120> got<00:03:27.329> three

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
insert and draw through we've got three

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.430 
insert and draw through we've got three
loops<00:03:27.870> now<00:03:28.670> yarn<00:03:29.670> over<00:03:30.090> insert<00:03:30.750> and<00:03:31.230> draw

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
loops now yarn over insert and draw

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.059 
loops now yarn over insert and draw
through<00:03:31.769> that's<00:03:32.010> five<00:03:32.480> yarn<00:03:33.480> over<00:03:33.780> insert<00:03:34.500> and

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:35.069 
through that's five yarn over insert and

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:37.460 
through that's five yarn over insert and
draw<00:03:35.280> through<00:03:35.519> that's<00:03:35.730> seven<00:03:36.269> loops<00:03:36.510> yarn

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
draw through that's seven loops yarn

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.640 
draw through that's seven loops yarn
over<00:03:37.739> insert<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:39.450> draw<00:03:39.690> through<00:03:39.989> that's<00:03:40.230> nine

over insert and draw through that's nine

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.059 
over insert and draw through that's nine
and<00:03:41.180> we're<00:03:42.180> doing<00:03:42.299> 11<00:03:42.750> loops<00:03:43.079> total<00:03:43.530> yarn<00:03:43.859> over

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
and we're doing 11 loops total yarn over

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:47.150 
and we're doing 11 loops total yarn over
insert<00:03:44.310> that's<00:03:45.269> 11<00:03:46.049> okay<00:03:46.680> that's<00:03:46.950> going<00:03:47.100> to

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
insert that's 11 okay that's going to

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.059 
insert that's 11 okay that's going to
account<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:47.760> our<00:03:48.109> five<00:03:49.109> stitches<00:03:49.620> which<00:03:49.859> is

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
account for our five stitches which is

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.420 
account for our five stitches which is
two<00:03:50.700> pairs<00:03:51.000> for<00:03:51.120> each<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:51.900> then<00:03:52.500> our<00:03:52.920> bonus

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
two pairs for each and then our bonus

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:55.610 
two pairs for each and then our bonus
stitch<00:03:53.700> here<00:03:54.030> from<00:03:54.269> the<00:03:54.389> beginning<00:03:54.720> we'll

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
stitch here from the beginning we'll

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.370 
stitch here from the beginning we'll
yarn<00:03:55.889> over<00:03:56.190> and<00:03:56.400> draw<00:03:56.489> through<00:03:56.760> all<00:03:57.139> 11<00:03:58.139> loops

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
yarn over and draw through all 11 loops

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.379 
yarn over and draw through all 11 loops
and<00:03:58.709> then<00:03:59.190> we<00:03:59.430> will<00:03:59.670> yarn<00:03:59.910> over<00:04:00.209> and<00:04:00.239> draw

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
and then we will yarn over and draw

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.690 
and then we will yarn over and draw
through<00:04:00.780> that<00:04:00.959> last<00:04:01.230> loop<00:04:01.470> to<00:04:02.130> secure<00:04:02.519> them

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
through that last loop to secure them

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:04.699 
through that last loop to secure them
down<00:04:02.940> so<00:04:03.359> that's<00:04:03.450> how<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.720> crochet<00:04:03.959> the<00:04:04.380> half

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
down so that's how we crochet the half

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:08.400 
down so that's how we crochet the half
double<00:04:05.400> crochet<00:04:05.819> five<00:04:06.660> together<00:04:07.109> puff<00:04:07.440> stitch
