go<00:04:55.170> that's<00:04:55.350> full-on<00:04:55.620> POV<00:04:56.340> and<00:04:57.180> yet<00:04:57.420> obviously

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
go that's full-on POV and yet obviously

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.960 
go that's full-on POV and yet obviously
it's<00:04:58.200> an<00:04:58.290> SUV<00:04:58.410> you<00:04:58.800> sit<00:04:59.010> up<00:04:59.190> tall<00:04:59.460> so<00:04:59.700> you<00:04:59.730> get<00:04:59.940> a

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
it's an SUV you sit up tall so you get a

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.180 
it's an SUV you sit up tall so you get a
good<00:05:00.180> view<00:05:00.420> ahead<00:05:00.810> but<00:05:01.530> it's<00:05:01.650> quite<00:05:01.860> easier<00:05:02.130> to

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
good view ahead but it's quite easier to

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.160 
good view ahead but it's quite easier to
tell<00:05:02.340> with<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.520> corners<00:05:03.090> of<00:05:03.300> the<00:05:03.660> nose<00:05:03.900> and

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
tell with the corners of the nose and

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.380 
tell with the corners of the nose and
that<00:05:04.380> makes<00:05:04.590> it<00:05:04.710> very<00:05:04.770> easy<00:05:05.040> to<00:05:05.160> slot<00:05:05.670> this<00:05:05.820> q7

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:06.390 
that makes it very easy to slot this q7

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.360 
that makes it very easy to slot this q7
through<00:05:06.840> gaps<00:05:07.140> in<00:05:07.350> traffic<00:05:07.800> and<00:05:08.040> overall

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.370 
through gaps in traffic and overall

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.090 
through gaps in traffic and overall
visibility<00:05:08.550> is<00:05:09.090> good<00:05:09.450> a<00:05:09.720> pillars<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.800> little

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
visibility is good a pillars a little

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:13.190 
visibility is good a pillars a little
bit<00:05:11.310> fat<00:05:11.610> but<00:05:11.640> not<00:05:12.150> too<00:05:12.390> bad<00:05:12.630> not<00:05:12.840> too<00:05:12.900> much<00:05:13.110> of

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
bit fat but not too bad not too much of

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:14.990 
bit fat but not too bad not too much of
a<00:05:13.230> blind<00:05:13.470> spot<00:05:13.560> there<00:05:13.740> and<00:05:14.190> over-the-shoulder

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
a blind spot there and over-the-shoulder

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:17.510 
a blind spot there and over-the-shoulder
visibility<00:05:15.930> there<00:05:16.530> you<00:05:16.680> go<00:05:16.800> it's<00:05:16.920> pretty<00:05:17.160> good

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
visibility there you go it's pretty good

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.970 
visibility there you go it's pretty good
and<00:05:17.790> this<00:05:17.910> way<00:05:18.150> for<00:05:18.420> filtering<00:05:19.140> onto<00:05:19.830> a

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
and this way for filtering onto a

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.820 
and this way for filtering onto a
motorway<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.450> if<00:05:22.230> you<00:05:22.290> look<00:05:22.440> at<00:05:22.620> the<00:05:22.710> back

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
motorway and if you look at the back

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.030 
motorway and if you look at the back
window<00:05:23.270> big<00:05:24.270> rear<00:05:24.510> screen<00:05:24.900> so<00:05:25.440> you<00:05:25.500> get<00:05:25.800> a<00:05:25.830> good

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:26.040 
window big rear screen so you get a good

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.310 
window big rear screen so you get a good
view<00:05:26.310> behind<00:05:26.460> you<00:05:26.760> as<00:05:26.880> well<00:05:27.090> ok<00:05:27.660> so<00:05:27.690> that's

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:28.320 
view behind you as well ok so that's

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.020 
view behind you as well ok so that's
enough<00:05:28.410> of<00:05:28.710> the<00:05:28.800> hit<00:05:28.950> cam<00:05:29.160> test<00:05:29.460> let's<00:05:29.850> just

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.030 
enough of the hit cam test let's just

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.730 
enough of the hit cam test let's just
have<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> look<00:05:30.270> at<00:05:30.390> our<00:05:30.540> economy<00:05:30.960> test<00:05:31.500> so<00:05:31.680> I'll

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
have a look at our economy test so I'll

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:33.050 
have a look at our economy test so I'll
just<00:05:31.860> flick<00:05:32.040> through<00:05:32.070> the<00:05:32.280> menus<00:05:32.610> here<00:05:32.790> and

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
just flick through the menus here and

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.050 
just flick through the menus here and
see<00:05:33.240> that<00:05:33.270> this<00:05:33.660> ad<00:05:34.350> q7<00:05:34.950> is<00:05:35.040> returning<00:05:35.430> in<00:05:35.880> the

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
see that this ad q7 is returning in the

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:39.740 
see that this ad q7 is returning in the
real<00:05:36.210> world<00:05:36.420> an<00:05:36.840> average<00:05:37.170> of<00:05:37.340> 33<00:05:38.480> miles<00:05:39.480> per

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.950 
real world an average of 33 miles per

now<00:05:55.880> most<00:05:56.300> people<00:05:56.570> probably<00:05:56.720> won't<00:05:57.020> care

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:57.200 
now most people probably won't care

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.300 
now most people probably won't care
about<00:05:57.260> that<00:05:57.650> but<00:05:57.830> they<00:05:57.890> might<00:05:58.040> care<00:05:58.280> about

00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:58.310 
about that but they might care about

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.310 
about that but they might care about
this<00:05:58.730> to<00:05:59.390> get<00:05:59.510> in<00:05:59.570> the<00:05:59.630> backseat<00:05:59.780> it's<00:06:00.260> a

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:00.320 
this to get in the backseat it's a

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:01.840 
this to get in the backseat it's a
little<00:06:00.590> bit<00:06:00.710> of<00:06:00.800> appalamma<00:06:01.160> so<00:06:01.340> you<00:06:01.460> fold<00:06:01.670> this

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:01.850 
little bit of appalamma so you fold this

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:03.700 
little bit of appalamma so you fold this
down<00:06:01.910> and<00:06:02.330> then<00:06:02.420> you<00:06:02.540> have<00:06:02.570> to<00:06:02.780> point<00:06:03.320> this<00:06:03.470> up

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:03.710 
down and then you have to point this up

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:05.380 
down and then you have to point this up
and<00:06:04.220> it's<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.400> bit<00:06:04.520> heavy<00:06:04.670> at<00:06:04.790> first<00:06:05.060> but<00:06:05.240> then

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:05.390 
and it's a bit heavy at first but then

00:06:05.390 --> 00:06:07.390 
and it's a bit heavy at first but then
it<00:06:05.510> does<00:06:05.720> move<00:06:05.930> on<00:06:06.050> its<00:06:06.200> own<00:06:06.410> then<00:06:07.070> you<00:06:07.130> tumble

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:07.400 
it does move on its own then you tumble

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.340 
it does move on its own then you tumble
it<00:06:07.490> forward<00:06:07.910> and<00:06:08.090> then<00:06:08.690> to<00:06:08.810> put<00:06:08.990> up<00:06:09.110> the<00:06:09.200> rear

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
it forward and then to put up the rear

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.110 
it forward and then to put up the rear
seats<00:06:09.680> you<00:06:10.040> just<00:06:10.280> press<00:06:10.460> these<00:06:10.670> buttons<00:06:10.730> it's

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:11.120 
seats you just press these buttons it's

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.300 
seats you just press these buttons it's
electrically<00:06:11.660> operated<00:06:11.980> great<00:06:12.980> if<00:06:13.190> you're

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:13.310 
electrically operated great if you're

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:16.630 
electrically operated great if you're
lazy<00:06:13.490> if<00:06:14.560> you're<00:06:15.560> impatient<00:06:15.830> like<00:06:16.160> me<00:06:16.220> you

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:16.640 
lazy if you're impatient like me you

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:20.200 
lazy if you're impatient like me you
might<00:06:16.910> find<00:06:17.180> it<00:06:17.420> a<00:06:17.540> little<00:06:17.840> bit<00:06:18.110> slow<00:06:18.970> now<00:06:19.970> one

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:20.210 
might find it a little bit slow now one

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:22.180 
might find it a little bit slow now one
so<00:06:20.480> in<00:06:20.600> places<00:06:20.870> is<00:06:21.320> not<00:06:21.530> too<00:06:21.680> difficult<00:06:21.860> to<00:06:22.070> get

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:22.190 
so in places is not too difficult to get

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:23.650 
so in places is not too difficult to get
into<00:06:22.340> the<00:06:22.460> very<00:06:22.730> back<00:06:22.970> I<00:06:23.000> should<00:06:23.330> pop<00:06:23.540> the

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
into the very back I should pop the

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:27.850 
into the very back I should pop the
headrests<00:06:24.110> up<00:06:24.230> pull<00:06:25.100> this<00:06:25.220> down<00:06:26.470> fold<00:06:27.470> it<00:06:27.680> back

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
headrests up pull this down fold it back

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.260 
headrests up pull this down fold it back
once<00:06:28.160> again<00:06:28.280> bit<00:06:28.580> of<00:06:28.640> a<00:06:28.700> pallava

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
once again bit of a pallava

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.320 
once again bit of a pallava
and<00:06:29.500> then<00:06:30.500> with<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.340> seat<00:06:31.520> slid<00:06:31.820> forward<00:06:32.120> like

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:32.330 
and then with the seat slid forward like

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.760 
and then with the seat slid forward like
they<00:06:32.450> are<00:06:32.540> here<00:06:32.750> there's<00:06:32.990> actually<00:06:33.560> decent

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:33.770 
they are here there's actually decent

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:35.590 
they are here there's actually decent
knee<00:06:34.040> room<00:06:34.190> have<00:06:34.340> a<00:06:34.370> look<00:06:34.520> at<00:06:34.640> that<00:06:34.820> and<00:06:35.000> then

00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:35.600 
knee room have a look at that and then

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.320
