00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
disappointing but it turns out that i

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.200 
disappointing but it turns out that i
was<00:04:45.360> i<00:04:45.660> was<00:04:46.020> going<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:46.410> have<00:04:46.560> to<00:04:46.590> buy<00:04:47.210> something

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
was i was going to have to buy something

was i was going to have to buy something
else

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
else

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.240 
else
besides<00:04:49.980> the<00:04:50.310> capture<00:04:50.640> card<00:04:50.670> and<00:04:51.060> I<00:04:51.120> was<00:04:51.240> like

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.250 
besides the capture card and I was like

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:54.590 
besides the capture card and I was like
it<00:04:53.250> would<00:04:53.370> just<00:04:53.460> turn<00:04:53.670> out<00:04:53.790> to<00:04:53.970> be<00:04:54.090> kind<00:04:54.450> of

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
it would just turn out to be kind of

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.840 
it would just turn out to be kind of
expensive<00:04:54.900> actually<00:04:55.710> because<00:04:56.400> the<00:04:56.490> capture

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
expensive actually because the capture

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.280 
expensive actually because the capture
card<00:04:56.880> was<00:04:57.210> already<00:04:57.510> going<00:04:57.660> to<00:04:57.780> be<00:04:57.870> like<00:04:57.990> eighty

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
dollars and the other thing was going to

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.240 
dollars and the other thing was going to
be<00:05:01.050> like<00:05:01.200> over<00:05:01.940> sixty<00:05:02.940> dollars<00:05:03.300> so<00:05:03.510> i<00:05:03.540> was<00:05:03.690> like
