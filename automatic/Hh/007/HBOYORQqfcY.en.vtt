 that I saw her regularly against 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.440
 compensation did not find anything wrong 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:33.730
 I nailed him, they are people 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.440

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:40.870

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:43.959

 had noticed these terrible a good 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.920
 I was lucky they put me in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.670
 side of a small Down syndrome that made me 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:53.670
 laugh five or six days 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.560
 after a while it goes round and round 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.030
 anyway so I took the opportunity to 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.500
 have fun on the top floor with the 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.700
 pregnant women you see discreetly 

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.340
 dad daddy daddy 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:08.250

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.420
 everyone goes down it's a fire 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.420

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.139
 go laugh, go laugh 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.210
 there are some who did not take it well at all 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:31.770
 but hey if you want my opinion them 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.770
 burn victims have no humor 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.660
 after a while he locked me in 

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.759
 a room alone you do not know 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.169
 Why 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.720
 good the doctor he started telling me 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.910
 that here with cannabis it started 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.380
 an opinion but it's funny because it 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.150
 there is no debate about cannabis in 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:51.039
 france you are noticed all the 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.419

00:04:51.039 --> 00:05:00.100

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.340
