00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
of figure just hang up at different sort

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.859 
of figure just hang up at different sort
of<00:01:40.759> levels<00:01:41.759> of<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> same<00:01:42.119> film<00:01:42.570> would<00:01:42.689> drop

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
of levels of the same film would drop

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.850 
of levels of the same film would drop
yeah<00:01:43.079> okay<00:01:43.799> have<00:01:43.950> light<00:01:44.630> for<00:01:45.630> teens<00:01:45.899> run<00:01:46.590> lots

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
on a tow night session how much would

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.680 
on a tow night session how much would

you put out when you first got there

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.300 
you put out when you first got there
presume<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.870> it<00:02:42.930> was<00:02:43.020> three<00:02:43.230> rods<00:02:43.470> yeah<00:02:44.160> it's

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
presume and it was three rods yeah it's

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.530 
presume and it was three rods yeah it's
a<00:02:44.370> bit<00:02:44.490> of<00:02:44.550> a<00:02:44.640> tricky<00:02:44.910> question<00:02:45.300> because<00:02:45.360> it

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
a bit of a tricky question because it

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.240 
a bit of a tricky question because it
depends<00:02:45.780> on<00:02:45.810> your<00:02:45.930> budget<00:02:46.080> on<00:02:46.320> to<00:02:46.500> it<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:47.040> does

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
depends on your budget on to it it does

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.460 
depends on your budget on to it it does
yeah<00:02:47.580> but<00:02:47.760> what<00:02:48.600> you<00:02:48.780> know<00:02:48.900> what<00:02:49.140> could<00:02:49.350> you

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
yeah but what you know what could you

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:50.900 
yeah but what you know what could you
what<00:02:49.680> what's<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.100> minimum<00:02:50.459> you<00:02:50.610> could<00:02:50.760> get

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
what what's the minimum you could get

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:52.010 
what what's the minimum you could get
away<00:02:51.000> with<00:02:51.330> put<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.690> way

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
away with put it that way

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.640 
away with put it that way
um<00:02:52.580> stop<00:02:53.580> if<00:02:54.209> you<00:02:54.330> say<00:02:54.570> someone<00:02:54.810> likes<00:02:54.930> underst

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
um stop if you say someone likes underst

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.440 
um stop if you say someone likes underst
yep<00:02:55.890> quite<00:02:56.190> good<00:02:56.610> stock<00:02:56.880> in<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.060> face<00:02:57.239> yeah

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
yep quite good stock in the face yeah

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.610 
yep quite good stock in the face yeah
lock<00:02:57.630> begins<00:02:58.020> yeah<00:02:58.380> I<00:02:58.530> I<00:02:58.800> would<00:02:59.430> probably

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
lock begins yeah I I would probably

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.830 
lock begins yeah I I would probably
spread<00:03:01.620> couple<00:03:02.580> kilos<00:03:02.730> over<00:03:03.150> three<00:03:03.360> rods<00:03:03.540> but

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
spread couple kilos over three rods but

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.750 
spread couple kilos over three rods but
I<00:03:03.870> push<00:03:04.140> all<00:03:04.320> three<00:03:04.650> quite<00:03:04.920> tight<00:03:05.220> right

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
I push all three quite tight right

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.210 
I push all three quite tight right
imagine<00:03:06.660> that<00:03:07.020> make<00:03:07.200> the<00:03:07.320> most<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:07.680> me<00:03:07.890> little

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
imagine that make the most of me little

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.470 
imagine that make the most of me little
bit<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.430> money<00:03:08.550> I've<00:03:08.730> got<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:09.030> whatever<00:03:09.270> money

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
bit of money I've got or whatever money

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.110 
bit of money I've got or whatever money
you<00:03:09.540> got<00:03:09.810> spent<00:03:10.260> okay<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.800> then<00:03:11.010> what<00:03:11.550> in<00:03:11.760> that

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
you got spent okay and then what in that

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.880 
you got spent okay and then what in that
same<00:03:12.360> situation<00:03:12.600> when<00:03:13.230> would<00:03:13.410> you<00:03:13.530> put<00:03:13.709> more
