00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 hello everyone, I got such discs here 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:10.700
 on mercedes vito 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:18.180
 front pair front discs 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:20.100
 company a b poland specializes 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.300
 brake cylinder manufacturer 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:29.910
 drum pads hydraulics all that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 associated with the clutch in general, then in general 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.950
 then the best option I am so 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.120
 I think price quality quality is not on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:47.489
 the worst place well and the price seems to be 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:51.809
 how happy at the moment I took them not 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:55.379
 through the online store found a shop in 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.260
 reputable city and where 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.960
 everything was available 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:03.140
 let's talk later about choosing parts where 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.479
 better to choose an online store or 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.479
 so here I bought for example 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:11.549
 availability may be interested 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:16.049
 I will make a separate video talk on this 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:26.040
 but now let's see what we have 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:31.729
 here in the package 2 discs such disks are needed 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:38.270
 were such wheels say no easy 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:38.270
 when compared to cars Lada 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:47.820
 packaging is all intact 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:53.270
 inside the mask let's open it pull out 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.049
 drive and just check its integrity 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.899
 check integrity 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.399
 more generally we check nothing 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.799
 able to think 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:11.750
 and do not need a new product, it will show 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:21.620
 always in work it is clear that the disk 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:21.620
 ventilated a. 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.650
 that is, there are manufacturers 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:38.970
 because some online shopping 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:44.069
 sin by ordering an example disk 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:45.420
 b you come box can even 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.829
 pass box b.e. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:52.620
 and in it, for example, lie drives well name or 

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:55.670
 the disk is frankly written there 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:03:01.430
 another some kind of Chinese 

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:05.640
 the company is one of the reasons why 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:08.660
 how would i fear such gave order 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.660
 in online store 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:19.769
 so I bought this case 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:25.379
 if you are the fact of the fact 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:30.650
 having an event of which people know that I 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:38.630
 I will come and limit 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:38.630
 40 tites see integrity in order 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:49.290
 in order can be in transit 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:57.150
 blows which is all the rest so mark 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:58.099

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:00.840

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.989
 these discs and watch them for their 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.780
 working like a machine in motion feels 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:14.280
 when braking everything else but to whom 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:16.739
 interesting to do a video after after them 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.900
