 thank you for taking the time, come hope 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.030
 not the last time many public people 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.980
 now that's saved these days in the month 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.380
 can not be indifferent to the events 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.289
 country and if you look at your 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.840
 facebook page there you all write 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.000
 This is extremely about Maidan and events Ukraine 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.740
 our life about people as your life 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.450
 changed the events in the country you know i by 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.670
 I can't touch a certain point 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.760
 certain topics of particular political 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.829
 don't stay indifferent because 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.629
 our country can not occur because it is 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.629
 principle of will outpouring all the people 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.969
 who lives who wants to live and 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.809
 who are trying to build their future in 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.649
 In this country, what happened with us is 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.270
 the event is directly related 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 let's say so with those circumstances with 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.989
 which are encountered 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.049
 our people and 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:08.040
 their response we must respect first 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.680
 turn I was definitely just amazed 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 because in amazed at all that 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.770
 happens being unfortunately with 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.590
 team attack in preparation I 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.570
 watched all the events and my wife and 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.119
 my friends took direct 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.119
 participation I physically could not do it 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:30.930
 but I was morally quite a tree felt 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:35.300
 every action that was many 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:39.540
 my friends suffered hurt by 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.510
 of those let's say the circumstances that they are 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.640
 hit and it was awful it was awful 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.390
 i heard their stories i heard their stories 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:51.200
 I physically practically felt all that 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.180
 they felt it to certainly 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.520
 stay indifferent to everything 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.090
 what was happening is simply impossible 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.009
 was how your loved ones are going through not 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.310
 I'm not talking about my parents 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.250
 which I have are very impressionable 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.860
 i have them a little 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:16.170
 calms but words you calm 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:19.560
 how do you reassure you because i 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.650
 I know I know how it is what imprint 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:27.420
 imposed on my father my grandfather father 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.060
 my father because he went through 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.280
 the war he went through all those events he 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.320
 never under any circumstances 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.390
 always wanted to touch on this topic 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.260
 got up always left when i tried 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:44.129
 develop to create 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.709
 tree kinda he doesn't say a word 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:48.360
 spoke he got up and left at first 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:49.260
 the glass that he was raising rose 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.560
 in words 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.840
 for never having a war 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.200
 a lot of silence after your words and 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.810
 memories of grandfather and he knew about 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.110
 war firsthand alexander what 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.480
 these are such important important words he 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.970
 handed to you to support 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.129
 your spirit in different life situations and 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.750
 who made you inner strong 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.670
 man well, definitely hard to say i am 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.250
 I think it's worth talking about such 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:25.970
 small continuity because from 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:30.230
 father from grandfather to father from father to me and I 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:34.079
 always tried to raise me 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:36.780
 a man with certain views 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.819
 who defend their position clearly 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:39.299
 competently able to articulate in the same 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:41.700
 time 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.709
 respects the opinions of other people I always 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.980
 supporter of having a dialogue and in 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:50.050
 skill dialogue is correct i am clear and 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.750
 correctly express my thought but at the same time 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:55.000
 do not give vent to emotions because emotions 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.200
 sometimes often ruin any 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.910
 constructive dialogue which can be 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.940
 based on this of course I am very 

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.730
 sorry to listen to comments to different 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:10.240
 giving birth to other people because 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.510
 that any truth or can come to 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.940
 consensus only when there is 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.160
 mutual respect when saying your 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:21.220
 point of view and often we have people very 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.280
 emotionally perceives everything to 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.280
 different and may be difficult because 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.990
 that we are all made up of feelings and these 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.670
 feelings are overwhelming us now 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.580
 what's happening now in our 

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:37.090
 the country is what might possibly happen 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.670
 God forbid I do not want to Ukraine 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.070
 became a proving ground for hostilities 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.690
 because we live in this country and us 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.350
 will have to live with it 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:49.810
 did you think about how you can help 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:52.120
 this situation that you can change 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:53.950
 maybe you thought about going 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.300
 in politics for example how did it 

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:01.620
 nickname thought about it know everything you need 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:05.130
 do step by step and 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.340
 and I do not exclude such a possibility but 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.070
 let's eat while my sports career 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.180
 and while it continues I have no right 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.550
 to do politics 

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.150
 Now mostly Ukrainian 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.380
 Ukrainians such a mood 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.150
 anxiety and fear seem to me probably 

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:23.430
 something like that to those sensations 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:26.540
 who are you experiencing when you play 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:29.100
 strong rival that's how you feel 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.190
 how to overcome this fear and 

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:34.260
 tune in to victory you know with you 

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.960
 no agreement to the fact that going out on 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.580
 football field I have no fear 

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:41.580
 I have experience in 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:43.680
 training I have an understanding with whom 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.800
 we will play them without going on 

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:49.590
 football field go out with a sober head 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.330
 warm heart because it is not always 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:54.350
 I try to keep my emotions with me 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.550
 even positive negative any 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.260
 unsuccessfully played episode successfully 

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.180
 played episode he should not affect 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:01.830
 on my inner state on my 

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:03.990
 willingness to really 

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:06.780
 be able to prove myself I consider 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.310
 in the same way emotions are the worst ally 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:12.300
 in dealing with any other 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.820
 any tasks because emotions can 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.880
 judge the horizon and not give the opportunity 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.260
 see the picture so connor is 

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.910
