have a what would you call it it's
plugged<00:01:09.180> in<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> can't<00:01:09.750> really<00:01:09.869> bring<00:01:10.170> it

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.210 
I'm trying to give that another little
ways<00:03:01.209> up<00:03:03.870> okay<00:03:04.900> so<00:03:05.380> I'll<00:03:05.470> let<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.620> spin<00:03:06.010> for

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
ways up okay so I'll let that spin for

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.910 
ways up okay so I'll let that spin for
about<00:03:06.400> a<00:03:06.430> minute<00:03:06.880> and<00:03:07.090> mixed<00:03:07.810> it<00:03:07.930> a<00:03:08.140> half<00:03:08.680> way

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:08.920 
about a minute and mixed it a half way

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.530 
about a minute and mixed it a half way
so<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.160> mixed<00:03:09.430> up<00:03:09.489> their<00:03:09.730> seconds<00:03:10.209> and<00:03:10.330> let<00:03:10.420> it

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
so I mixed up their seconds and let it

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.570 
so I mixed up their seconds and let it
spin<00:03:10.720> again<00:03:11.020> so<00:03:11.770> as<00:03:11.830> you<00:03:11.920> can<00:03:12.010> see<00:03:12.250> this<00:03:12.459> is

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
spin again so as you can see this is

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.650 
spin again so as you can see this is
what<00:03:12.730> it's<00:03:12.850> starting<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.180> look<00:03:13.270> like<00:03:13.450> it's

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:51.969 
peanut butter just because I think it's

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:00.129 
still a little bit thick I mean this is

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:01.740 
still a little bit thick I mean this is
just<00:04:00.159> trial<00:04:00.579> and<00:04:00.669> error<00:04:00.790> really<00:04:01.120> if<00:04:01.329> you<00:04:01.480> think

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
just trial and error really if you think

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:02.970 
just trial and error really if you think
that<00:04:01.900> it's<00:04:02.019> getting<00:04:02.139> a<00:04:02.260> little<00:04:02.349> bit<00:04:02.530> too<00:04:02.680> thick

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
that it's getting a little bit too thick

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.709 
that it's getting a little bit too thick
add<00:04:03.340> a<00:04:03.400> bit<00:04:03.760> more<00:04:04.319> honey<00:04:05.319> or<00:04:05.620> oil<00:04:05.950> depending<00:04:06.519> on

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:06.719 
add a bit more honey or oil depending on

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:09.209

the<00:04:07.719> flavoring<00:04:08.139> that<00:04:08.169> you<00:04:08.349> like<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.919> if<00:04:09.069> you

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.399 
few minutes but this is perfect I like
my<00:04:40.150> peanut<00:04:40.930> butter<00:04:41.080> to<00:04:41.259> be<00:04:41.289> like<00:04:41.500> that<00:04:43.289> if<00:04:44.289> you

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:44.409 
my peanut butter to be like that if you

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.409 
my peanut butter to be like that if you
just<00:04:44.500> couldn't<00:04:44.710> see<00:04:45.030> probably<00:04:46.030> not<00:04:46.180> as<00:04:46.300> bit

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:46.419 
just couldn't see probably not as bit

00:04:46.419 --> 00:04:47.909 
just couldn't see probably not as bit
blurry<00:04:46.599> so<00:04:46.810> now<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:47.229> going<00:04:47.409> to<00:04:47.470> put<00:04:47.650> it<00:04:47.740> into

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
blurry so now just going to put it into

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:50.100 
blurry so now just going to put it into
your<00:04:48.039> jar<00:04:48.699> which<00:04:48.880> you<00:04:49.000> have<00:04:49.150> cleaned<00:04:49.449> out<00:04:49.630> make

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
your jar which you have cleaned out make

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:51.210 
your jar which you have cleaned out make
sure<00:04:50.139> it's<00:04:50.349> been<00:04:50.500> bleached<00:04:50.740> out<00:04:50.979> and

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
sure it's been bleached out and

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.210 
sure it's been bleached out and
everything<00:04:51.550> I<00:04:55.169> like<00:04:56.169> my<00:04:56.380> pimple<00:04:56.770> drink<00:04:56.949> bit

00:04:57.210 --> 00:04:57.220 
everything I like my pimple drink bit

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:01.800 
everything I like my pimple drink bit
like<00:04:57.610> this<00:04:57.990> so<00:04:58.990> um<00:05:00.150> yeah<00:05:01.150> what<00:05:01.389> I<00:05:01.449> mean<00:05:01.570> if<00:05:01.720> you

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:01.810 
like this so um yeah what I mean if you

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:03.029 
like this so um yeah what I mean if you
like<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.110> smoothes<00:05:02.380> I<00:05:02.560> think<00:05:02.740> I've<00:05:02.860> said<00:05:02.979> this

00:05:03.029 --> 00:05:03.039 
like it smoothes I think I've said this

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.320 
like it smoothes I think I've said this
before<00:05:03.509> let<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.630> run<00:05:04.870> a<00:05:05.080> little<00:05:05.289> bit<00:05:05.470> longer

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
before let it run a little bit longer

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:24.140 
before let it run a little bit longer
not<00:05:07.330> so<00:05:07.449> pretty<00:05:07.509> to<00:05:07.750> say<00:05:07.900> that

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.610 

and<00:05:25.150> I<00:05:25.270> think<00:05:25.479> that's<00:05:25.690> enough<00:05:26.020> for<00:05:26.050> that<00:05:26.350> jar

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
and I think that's enough for that jar

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:33.230 
and I think that's enough for that jar
squeeze<00:05:27.490> it<00:05:27.639> down<00:05:27.759> and<00:05:29.789> there<00:05:30.789> we<00:05:30.940> have<00:05:31.120> it

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
squeeze it down and there we have it

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.279 
squeeze it down and there we have it
homemade<00:05:34.590> peanut<00:05:35.590> butter<00:05:36.509> okay<00:05:37.509> so<00:05:37.780> there<00:05:38.169> you

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:38.289 
homemade peanut butter okay so there you

00:05:38.289 --> 00:05:40.320 
homemade peanut butter okay so there you
have<00:05:38.320> it<00:05:38.470> this<00:05:38.860> is<00:05:38.919> crunch<00:05:39.310> a<00:05:39.639> homemade<00:05:40.120> peanut

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:40.330 
have it this is crunch a homemade peanut

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.740 
have it this is crunch a homemade peanut
butter<00:05:41.039> it<00:05:42.039> was<00:05:42.190> really<00:05:42.699> easy<00:05:42.940> to<00:05:43.150> make<00:05:43.389> really

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
butter it was really easy to make really

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.480 
butter it was really easy to make really
simple<00:05:43.930> as<00:05:44.229> you<00:05:44.350> saw<00:05:44.530> just<00:05:44.560> a<00:05:44.889> few<00:05:44.919> easy<00:05:45.310> steps

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
simple as you saw just a few easy steps

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.810 
simple as you saw just a few easy steps
it<00:05:46.360> would<00:05:46.419> have<00:05:46.539> been<00:05:46.690> even<00:05:47.080> easier<00:05:47.500> in<00:05:47.979> a<00:05:48.130> food

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:48.820 
it would have been even easier in a food

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:51.060 
it would have been even easier in a food
processor<00:05:49.000> but<00:05:49.930> it<00:05:50.110> can<00:05:50.350> be<00:05:50.530> done<00:05:50.680> in<00:05:50.919> a

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
processor but it can be done in a

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:54.060 
processor but it can be done in a
blender<00:05:51.460> or<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.760> liquidizer<00:05:52.240> as<00:05:52.570> you<00:05:52.720> seen<00:05:53.070> this

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.070 
blender or a liquidizer as you seen this

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.360 
blender or a liquidizer as you seen this
will<00:05:54.370> last<00:05:54.639> maybe<00:05:55.060> up<00:05:55.660> to<00:05:55.720> a<00:05:56.050> month<00:05:56.410> in<00:05:56.770> like<00:05:57.340> a
