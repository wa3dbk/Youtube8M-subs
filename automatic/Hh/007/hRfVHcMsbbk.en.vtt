to<00:00:12.750> remove<00:00:13.080> a<00:00:13.200> bearing<00:00:13.590> from<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:14.009> shaft<00:00:14.250> but<00:00:15.350> now

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
to remove a bearing from a shaft but now

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.769

bearing<00:02:53.120> easily<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:55.370> bearing<00:02:55.730> is<00:02:55.849> put<00:02:56.120> on

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
bearing easily the bearing is put on

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:05.140 
bearing easily the bearing is put on
followed<00:02:58.220> by<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.400> hydraulic<00:02:58.849> nut<00:03:04.000> then<00:03:05.000> you

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
followed by a hydraulic nut then you

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.520 
followed by a hydraulic nut then you
connect<00:03:05.480> the<00:03:05.629> oil<00:03:05.810> pump<00:03:08.079> let's<00:03:09.079> see<00:03:09.319> what

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
connect the oil pump let's see what

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.300 
connect the oil pump let's see what
happens<00:03:09.950> when<00:03:10.129> the<00:03:10.250> oil<00:03:10.280> is<00:03:10.700> injected<00:03:12.099> the<00:03:13.099> oil

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 
happens when the oil is injected the oil

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.849 
happens when the oil is injected the oil
pressure<00:03:13.700> inside<00:03:14.329> the<00:03:14.510> hydraulic<00:03:15.019> nut<00:03:15.230> pushes

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
pressure inside the hydraulic nut pushes

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.280 
pressure inside the hydraulic nut pushes
out<00:03:16.010> a<00:03:16.040> piston<00:03:16.609> which<00:03:17.269> in<00:03:17.450> turn<00:03:17.689> drives<00:03:17.930> the

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
out a piston which in turn drives the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.179 
out a piston which in turn drives the
bearing<00:03:18.650> onto<00:03:18.799> the<00:03:19.099> sleeve<00:03:20.739> now<00:03:21.739> let's<00:03:22.010> look

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:22.189 
bearing onto the sleeve now let's look

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.229 
bearing onto the sleeve now let's look
at<00:03:22.340> how<00:03:22.400> it<00:03:22.519> works<00:03:22.819> once<00:03:23.120> more<00:03:24.639> the<00:03:25.639> internal

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
at how it works once more the internal

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:27.759 
at how it works once more the internal
clearance<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> bearing<00:03:27.349> is<00:03:27.530> now<00:03:27.709> the

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
clearance of the bearing is now the

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.420 
clearance of the bearing is now the
normal<00:03:28.280> recommended<00:03:28.970> value<00:03:29.359> and<00:03:30.430> checking

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
normal recommended value and checking

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.909 
normal recommended value and checking
this<00:03:31.609> is<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.819> simple<00:03:32.299> matter<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:35.680> dismount<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:36.919 
this is a simple matter to dismount the

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:39.069 
this is a simple matter to dismount the
bearing<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.340> simply<00:03:37.879> reverse<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.299> hydraulic

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
bearing you simply reverse the hydraulic

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:44.670 
bearing you simply reverse the hydraulic
nut

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:49.089 

then<00:03:45.680> you<00:03:45.860> add<00:03:46.040> a<00:03:46.069> stop<00:03:46.550> ring<00:03:46.849> and<00:03:47.920> inject<00:03:48.920> the

00:03:49.089 --> 00:03:49.099 
then you add a stop ring and inject the

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.490 
then you add a stop ring and inject the
oil<00:03:50.200> this<00:03:51.200> is<00:03:51.379> what<00:03:51.560> happens<00:03:52.010> and<00:03:53.140> now<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.200> can

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
oil this is what happens and now you can

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.680 
oil this is what happens and now you can
easily<00:03:54.709> remove<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.459> bearing<00:03:58.690> conventional

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
easily remove the bearing conventional

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.690 
easily remove the bearing conventional
bolts<00:04:00.080> for<00:04:00.260> flange<00:04:00.590> couplings<00:04:01.160> are<00:04:01.310> not<00:04:01.459> that

easy<00:04:01.910> to<00:04:02.060> remove<00:04:02.510> this<00:04:03.230> is<00:04:03.470> the<00:04:03.590> standard

00:04:04.059 --> 00:04:04.069 
easy to remove this is the standard

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.530 
easy to remove this is the standard
technique<00:04:04.519> for<00:04:04.549> removing<00:04:04.940> a<00:04:05.360> troublesome<00:04:05.750> nut

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
technique for removing a troublesome nut

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.539 
technique for removing a troublesome nut
once<00:04:08.540> you<00:04:08.720> remove<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.290> nut<00:04:09.560> it's<00:04:10.010> still<00:04:10.280> hard

00:04:10.539 --> 00:04:10.549 
once you remove the nut it's still hard

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:13.630 
once you remove the nut it's still hard
work<00:04:10.790> to<00:04:11.000> remove<00:04:11.150> the<00:04:11.329> bolt<00:04:12.340> but<00:04:13.340> there's<00:04:13.579> a

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
work to remove the bolt but there's a

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.670 
work to remove the bolt but there's a
way<00:04:13.819> of<00:04:13.849> avoiding<00:04:14.299> all<00:04:14.659> this<00:04:16.299> use<00:04:17.299> SKF<00:04:18.139> super

hole the inside of the sleeve is tapered

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.830 
hole the inside of the sleeve is tapered
then<00:04:31.070> the<00:04:31.250> super<00:04:31.580> grip<00:04:31.789> bolt<00:04:32.060> is<00:04:32.270> inserted

matches the taper of the sleeve you

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:45.939 
matches the taper of the sleeve you
attach<00:04:39.050> a<00:04:39.229> hydraulic<00:04:39.770> jack<00:04:44.590> connect<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.740> pump

attach a hydraulic jack connect the pump

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:49.930 
attach a hydraulic jack connect the pump
and<00:04:46.190> oil<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.760> forced<00:04:47.120> in<00:04:48.400> the<00:04:49.400> hydraulic

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
and oil is forced in the hydraulic

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.879 
and oil is forced in the hydraulic
pressure<00:04:50.210> pulls<00:04:50.690> the<00:04:50.930> bolt<00:04:51.139> into<00:04:51.380> the<00:04:51.500> sleeve

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
pressure pulls the bolt into the sleeve

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.129 
pressure pulls the bolt into the sleeve
which<00:04:52.400> expands<00:04:53.120> and<00:04:53.300> presses<00:04:53.690> outwards

00:04:54.129 --> 00:04:54.139 
which expands and presses outwards

00:04:54.139 --> 00:05:03.000 
which expands and presses outwards
against<00:04:54.620> the<00:04:54.770> bolt<00:04:54.950> hole<00:04:55.220> giving<00:04:55.849> a<00:04:55.940> firm<00:04:56.240> grip

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:03.010 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:05.620 

then<00:05:04.010> the<00:05:04.160> process<00:05:04.580> is<00:05:04.760> repeated<00:05:04.940> with<00:05:05.450> the

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
then the process is repeated with the

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:14.650 
then the process is repeated with the
nuts<00:05:05.840> in<00:05:06.050> place

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:14.660 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:18.140

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
in this case oil pressure is used to

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.590 
in this case oil pressure is used to
pre-stress<00:05:18.840> the<00:05:19.080> bolt<00:05:19.290> and<00:05:20.389> it's<00:05:21.389> then<00:05:21.570> a

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:21.600 
pre-stress the bolt and it's then a

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.710 
pre-stress the bolt and it's then a
simple<00:05:22.080> job<00:05:22.350> to<00:05:22.560> tighten<00:05:22.980> the<00:05:23.130> nut<00:05:23.340> to
