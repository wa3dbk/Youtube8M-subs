00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:13.420
 hello today the yuksek and nerves 

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:17.550
 gran master 36 a head at the amp 80 84 3 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:22.570
 2 s is based on the majster tube 36 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.810
 to which we added a channel a section 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:30.179
 facts and an entire interface that 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:33.129
 allows to control it with an ipad 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.379
 the amp also includes 128 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.950
 precedes that one can modify either 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:42.160
 directly through various buttons that 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.350
 can be found on its facade either on 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.600
 the interface that the ipad provides 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.590
 so we have all the functions 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:53.649
 main amp and so we can 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.579
 take care of the effects section 

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:00.149
 be dealing with the section of 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:04.390
 preamps and channel changes 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:07.060
 see here everything about the 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.970
 storing the sounds we have 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 worked here the power of the amp on 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:13.770
 can cut for example the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.040
 the speaker directly from here because 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.360
 know that as the series 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.090
 buyster tubes is fine in this 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.799
 amp has a red box 5 that is integrated 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.780
 so we can use it to make 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.130
 recordings directly plugged into 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 a console and then here we have two 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.960
 additional buttons 1 which allows for 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.090
 mutate entirely the amp greenhouse that there 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.310
 it's really complete silence and then 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.009
 another one that will allow to see the 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.470
 parameter values ​​appear on 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:45.179
 the buttons so we'll do a little 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.090
 tower inside the memories 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:50.640
 and then we'll touch the buttons to 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.350
 see what it's like we'll see it's 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.920
 very easy to control this amp 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.720
 directly from the ipad 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.170
 we start with a little bluesy precedes 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.170
 clean 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.620
 the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.150
 so what's interesting is that 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:14.760
 there we are inclined but we can very well 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.500
 go into crunch directly keeping 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.620
 on the same precedes to see what that 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.620
 given 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.629
 and then we can continue we can go 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.629
 in lead 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.530
 we will continue to walk around 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.720
 near 7 we'll get them for example 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.700
 is a little bit of metal just for the 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.270
 pleasure here is said metal very well to 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.270
 vied 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.190
 1 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.110
 what is interesting is that 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.970
 on the same side 7 we can test 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.040
 lots of things one can for example 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:17.659
 possibly cut the reverb for 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:21.739
 see it maybe will be more fun 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:23.780
 so then we'll go see other 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:28.610
 such thing trying to find 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:32.349
 Here are a well clean with a 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.349
 effect a little strong on it 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.950
 we 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.950
 yeah 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.370
 the 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.920
 so we learned a little more 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:09.910
 nasty the classic the idea we will vary 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:09.910
 the power on 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:45.210
 he 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:52.080
 I can even cut entirely so the 

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.080
 loud speaker 

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.150
 2 

00:05:43.129 --> 00:05:45.189
 m 

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:48.660
 m 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.960
 Oh 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.960
 coc 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.480
 a year 

00:06:00.510 --> 00:06:04.480
 no 

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.480
 1 

00:06:07.009 --> 00:06:09.009
 Oh 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:12.190
 daemon 

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.159
 m 

00:06:39.889 --> 00:06:41.889
 at 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:08.890
 after this short, non-exhaustive tour of 

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:11.590
 possibilities of the beast 

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:14.410
 know that all the precepts are 

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:17.260
 registered in the head so we 

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:20.710
 absolutely no need for ipad for 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:22.600
 go and play in concert in rehearsal that 

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.200
 for against you he had seen it's a 

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.940
 great opportunity to settle everything 

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:30.610
 what we want inside the amp 

00:07:27.940 --> 00:07:34.090
 without having to touch the buttons and 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.910
 know that a crankset dedicated to 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.500
 gran master 36 exists which allows for 

00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:40.780
 remember all these loans 7 at the foot 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.600
 during the concert which allows 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:47.380
 obviously to have a lot of sounds to his 

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:52.050
 right disposition of a foot movement 

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:52.050
 and on that I greet you well
