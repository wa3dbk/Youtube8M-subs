00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
I've taken with it and so I'm going to

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.569 
I've taken with it and so I'm going to
start<00:00:34.200> with<00:00:34.350> the<00:00:34.500> cons<00:00:34.770> of<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> camera

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
start with the cons of the camera

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.360 
start with the cons of the camera
because<00:00:36.030> that's<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.380> I<00:00:37.410> look<00:00:37.829> for<00:00:38.160> when<00:00:38.190> I

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
because that's what I look for when I

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.869 
because that's what I look for when I
went<00:00:38.700> to<00:00:38.790> buy<00:00:39.120> it<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.890> so<00:00:40.890> my<00:00:41.250> first<00:00:41.399> con<00:00:41.700> is

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
went to buy it and so my first con is

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.959 
went to buy it and so my first con is
when<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.090> first<00:00:42.450> receive<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:43.050> I<00:00:43.200> noticed<00:00:43.590> that

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
when I first receive it I noticed that

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.450 
when I first receive it I noticed that
but<00:00:44.969> you<00:00:45.180> can't<00:00:45.539> there's<00:00:46.289> no<00:00:46.559> live<00:00:46.860> view<00:00:47.190> so

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
but you can't there's no live view so

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.000 
but you can't there's no live view so
what<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.670> means<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.379> most<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.530> time<00:00:49.739> you

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
what that means is most the time you

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.650 
what that means is most the time you
look<00:00:50.190> through<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.579> viewfinder<00:00:50.610> but<00:00:51.480> with

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
look through the viewfinder but with

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.569 
look through the viewfinder but with
other<00:00:51.840> cameras<00:00:52.379> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.590> also<00:00:52.860> have<00:00:53.160> like<00:00:53.399> the

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
other cameras you can also have like the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.660 
other cameras you can also have like the
picture<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.480> screen<00:00:54.809> and<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:56.070> cannot<00:00:56.430> do

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
picture on this screen and you cannot do

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.970 
picture on this screen and you cannot do
that<00:00:56.850> with<00:00:57.059> this<00:00:57.090> camera<00:00:57.510> which<00:00:58.379> at<00:00:58.559> first<00:00:58.590> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that with this camera which at first I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.139 
that with this camera which at first I
thought<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.370> was<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.730> to<00:00:59.789> be<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> huge

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
thought it was going to be a huge

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.459 
thought it was going to be a huge
problem<00:01:00.390> because<00:01:00.660> that's<00:01:01.140> what<00:01:01.320> I<00:01:01.350> always

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
problem because that's what I always

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.709 
problem because that's what I always
used<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> do<00:01:02.370> with<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:02.879> old<00:01:03.030> camera<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.510> never

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
used to do with my old camera I never

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.010 
used to do with my old camera I never
look<00:01:03.989> through<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> viewfinder<00:01:05.299> but<00:01:06.299> I<00:01:06.659> don't

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
look through the viewfinder but I don't

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.899 
look through the viewfinder but I don't
find<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.380> an<00:01:07.500> issue<00:01:07.680> at<00:01:07.950> all<00:01:08.159> now<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.729> I

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
find it an issue at all now and I

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.899 
find it an issue at all now and I
wouldn't<00:01:09.180> even<00:01:09.299> consider<00:01:10.100> like<00:01:11.100> going<00:01:11.670> back

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
wouldn't even consider like going back

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.480 
wouldn't even consider like going back
and<00:01:12.390> looking<00:01:12.630> at<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.290> screen<00:01:13.530> for<00:01:14.100> all<00:01:14.340> my

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
and looking at the screen for all my

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.160 
and looking at the screen for all my
other<00:01:14.729> cameras<00:01:15.150> it's<00:01:15.390> just<00:01:15.570> become<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> habit

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
other cameras it's just become a habit

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.330 
other cameras it's just become a habit
now<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.659> also<00:01:18.659> there<00:01:19.080> you<00:01:19.560> can't<00:01:19.830> record

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
now and also there you can't record

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.570 
now and also there you can't record
videos<00:01:21.080> which<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.470> know<00:01:22.590> most<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.130> you<00:01:23.340> won't

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
videos which I know most of you won't

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.840 
videos which I know most of you won't
even<00:01:23.880> think<00:01:24.330> about<00:01:24.540> but<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.380> do<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:26.040> lot<00:01:26.460> of<00:01:26.490> like

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
even think about but I do a lot of like

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.780 
even think about but I do a lot of like
short<00:01:27.390> films<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.320> stuff<00:01:28.650> like<00:01:28.950> that<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.430> so<00:01:29.759> I

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
short films and stuff like that and so I

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.969 
short films and stuff like that and so I
did<00:01:30.329> find<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.720> a<00:01:30.780> big<00:01:31.079> problem<00:01:31.680> and<00:01:32.420> also<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
did find it a big problem and also the

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
did find it a big problem and also the
camera<00:01:35.430> isn't<00:01:35.880> very<00:01:36.150> good<00:01:36.390> under<00:01:36.720> low<00:01:36.930> light

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
camera isn't very good under low light

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.950 
camera isn't very good under low light
conditions<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.790> could<00:01:38.970> argue<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.689> all

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
conditions and you could argue like all

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.719 
conditions and you could argue like all
that<00:01:40.110> could<00:01:40.320> be<00:01:40.439> down<00:01:40.619> to<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:40.890> lens<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.490> I've

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
that could be down to the lens but I've

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.330 
that could be down to the lens but I've
have<00:01:42.270> three<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.780> four<00:01:42.960> different<00:01:43.350> lenses<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
have three or four different lenses and

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.670 
have three or four different lenses and
the<00:01:45.030> camera<00:01:45.450> just<00:01:45.479> does<00:01:45.930> not<00:01:46.259> do<00:01:46.470> well<00:01:46.619> under

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
the camera just does not do well under

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.190 
the camera just does not do well under
low<00:01:47.100> light<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.360> I<00:01:48.390> know<00:01:48.600> all<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
low light you know I know all the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.770 
low light you know I know all the
settings<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.890> knew<00:01:50.040> how<00:01:50.460> to<00:01:50.520> make<00:01:50.970> it<00:01:51.180> best<00:01:51.540> at

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
settings I knew how to make it best at

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.810 
settings I knew how to make it best at
low<00:01:51.899> light<00:01:52.140> but<00:01:52.439> even<00:01:52.710> its<00:01:52.950> best<00:01:53.220> is<00:01:53.520> still

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
low light but even its best is still

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.480 
low light but even its best is still
pretty<00:01:54.630> bad<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.290> stuff<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.009> edges

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pretty bad and stuff like that edges

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:32.960 
this simple setup oh and if I can't i
forgot<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.620> mention<00:04:31.800> is<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.340> the<00:04:32.610> camera

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
forgot to mention is that the camera

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.439 
forgot to mention is that the camera
does<00:04:33.150> not<00:04:33.180> shoot<00:04:33.960> in<00:04:34.289> raw<00:04:34.350> mode<00:04:35.210> overall<00:04:36.210> I

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:36.449 
does not shoot in raw mode overall I

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:38.450 
does not shoot in raw mode overall I
think<00:04:36.539> this<00:04:36.900> camera<00:04:37.289> is<00:04:37.370> excellent<00:04:38.370> for
