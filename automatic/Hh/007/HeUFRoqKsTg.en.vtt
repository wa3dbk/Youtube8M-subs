situation assemble my guys before to get
because

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
because

how<00:01:58.310> many<00:01:58.460> units<00:01:58.640> I<00:01:58.940> need<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.300> beat<00:01:59.480> a<00:01:59.510> certain

00:01:59.860 --> 00:01:59.870 
how many units I need to beat a certain

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:01.570 
how many units I need to beat a certain
kind<00:02:00.080> of<00:02:00.140> unit<00:02:00.410> and<00:02:00.560> in<00:02:00.770> future<00:02:00.950> they'll<00:02:01.460> be

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
kind of unit and in future they'll be

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:02.650 
kind of unit and in future they'll be
able<00:02:01.700> to<00:02:01.820> deal<00:02:01.940> with<00:02:02.060> that<00:02:02.120> a<00:02:02.180> bit<00:02:02.240> better<00:02:02.510> but

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
able to deal with that a bit better but

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.130 
able to deal with that a bit better but
for<00:02:02.840> now<00:02:02.960> just<00:02:03.170> learning<00:02:03.760> and<00:02:04.780> really<00:02:05.780> waiting

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.140 
for now just learning and really waiting

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:07.900 
for now just learning and really waiting
for<00:02:06.350> reinforcements<00:02:07.010> here<00:02:07.100> those<00:02:07.310> barracks

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:07.910 
for reinforcements here those barracks

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.070 
for reinforcements here those barracks
are<00:02:08.030> quite<00:02:08.180> good<00:02:08.210> don't<00:02:08.630> need<00:02:08.750> so<00:02:08.930> many

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.080 
are quite good don't need so many

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.930 
are quite good don't need so many
barracks<00:02:09.470> because<00:02:09.830> once<00:02:10.430> you've<00:02:10.580> got<00:02:10.729> one<00:02:10.850> of

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
barracks because once you've got one of

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.690 
barracks because once you've got one of
those<00:02:11.030> those<00:02:11.810> who<00:02:11.990> love<00:02:12.350> add-ons<00:02:12.830> you<00:02:13.520> can

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
those those who love add-ons you can

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.060 
those those who love add-ons you can
double<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.180> rate<00:02:14.420> at<00:02:14.630> which<00:02:14.690> shone<00:02:15.140> guys<00:02:15.440> come

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
double the rate at which shone guys come

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.290 
double the rate at which shone guys come
out<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.340> essentially<00:02:16.700> I've<00:02:16.790> got<00:02:16.940> three

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
out so essentially I've got three

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.420 
out so essentially I've got three
barracks<00:02:18.020> one<00:02:18.950> of<00:02:19.010> them<00:02:19.130> for<00:02:19.250> producing

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
barracks one of them for producing

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.860 
barracks one of them for producing
Marauders<00:02:22.430> and<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.670> other<00:02:22.820> one<00:02:23.000> for<00:02:23.300> mass

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870 
Marauders and the other one for mass

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.300 
Marauders and the other one for mass
producing<00:02:24.230> Marines<00:02:24.530> two<00:02:24.740> at<00:02:24.830> a<00:02:24.890> time<00:02:24.920> so

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
producing Marines two at a time so

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.730 
producing Marines two at a time so
that's<00:02:25.490> equivalent<00:02:25.790> to<00:02:25.970> having<00:02:26.090> three<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:27.500> the

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:27.740 
that's equivalent to having three in the

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.380 
that's equivalent to having three in the
old<00:02:27.920> version<00:02:28.130> of<00:02:28.370> the<00:02:28.459> game<00:02:28.580> point<00:02:29.180> of<00:02:29.270> looking

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
old version of the game point of looking

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.840 
old version of the game point of looking
around<00:02:29.600> floor<00:02:30.020> of<00:02:30.650> my<00:02:30.830> potential<00:02:31.250> expansions

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
around floor of my potential expansions

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.640 
around floor of my potential expansions
he's<00:02:32.000> still<00:02:32.330> on<00:02:32.480> to<00:02:32.750> base<00:02:32.990> got<00:02:33.410> a<00:02:33.440> lot<00:02:33.620> of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
he's still on to base got a lot of

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.130 
he's still on to base got a lot of
roaches<00:02:33.830> in<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.190> field<00:02:34.430> and<00:02:34.900> just<00:02:35.900> have<00:02:36.020> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
roaches in the field and just have to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.910 
roaches in the field and just have to
wonder<00:02:36.320> whether<00:02:36.500> it's<00:02:36.650> going<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.830> be

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:36.920 
wonder whether it's going to be

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.550 
wonder whether it's going to be
attacking<00:02:37.370> with<00:02:38.240> this<00:02:38.390> number<00:02:38.570> rotors<00:02:38.990> we've

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:48.790 
need one range was really only useful

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.450 
need one range was really only useful
get<00:05:49.120> well<00:05:51.570> but<00:05:52.920> looks<00:05:53.920> like<00:05:53.980> you<00:05:54.160> don't<00:05:54.340> really

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460 
get well but looks like you don't really

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:55.650 
get well but looks like you don't really
need<00:05:54.670> it<00:05:54.820> that<00:05:54.940> much<00:05:55.060> because<00:05:55.210> if<00:05:55.420> you<00:05:55.510> want

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:55.660 
need it that much because if you want

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:58.140 
need it that much because if you want

range young you can Adam orders which I

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.640 
range young you can Adam orders which I
believe<00:05:58.390> has<00:05:58.450> slightly<00:05:58.900> longer<00:05:59.140> range<00:05:59.410> not

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650
