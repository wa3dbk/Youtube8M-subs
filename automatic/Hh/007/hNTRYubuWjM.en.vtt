00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
into a couple different things first off

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.850 
into a couple different things first off
we'll<00:01:09.450> note<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.840> surprising<00:01:10.470> go<00:01:10.590> for<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
we'll note that surprising go for the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
we'll note that surprising go for the
barracks<00:01:11.280> 112<00:01:11.610> instead<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.150> gas<00:01:12.330> like

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
barracks 112 instead of the gas like

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
barracks 112 instead of the gas like
ruff<00:01:12.750> did<00:01:12.960> he<00:01:13.380> puts<00:01:13.619> his<00:01:13.740> lost<00:01:13.920> his<00:01:14.369> off<00:01:14.490> ever

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
ruff did he puts his lost his off ever

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.609 
ruff did he puts his lost his off ever
so<00:01:14.880> slightly<00:01:15.180> this<00:01:15.840> gives<00:01:16.110> him<00:01:16.200> enough<00:01:16.409> gas

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
so slightly this gives him enough gas

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.080 
so slightly this gives him enough gas
that<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.950> he<00:01:17.009> decides<00:01:17.340> to<00:01:17.460> skip<00:01:17.670> a<00:01:17.790> Reaper

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
that if he decides to skip a Reaper

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.670 
that if he decides to skip a Reaper

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
want to get that faster factory you skip

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.639 
want to get that faster factory you skip
over<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.570> Reaper<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.049> have<00:01:49.229> the<00:01:49.290> extra<00:01:49.470> gas

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
over the Reaper you have the extra gas

over the Reaper you have the extra gas
for<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.130> this<00:01:50.220> was<00:01:50.369> the<00:01:50.520> lead<00:01:50.670> towards<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
for it this was the lead towards the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.850 
for it this was the lead towards the
fact<00:01:51.119> you're<00:01:51.299> faster<00:01:52.049> starboard<00:01:52.649> if<00:01:52.740> that's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
fact you're faster starboard if that's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.219

either<00:01:59.549> greedy<00:01:59.909> or<00:02:00.149> goes<00:02:00.360> for<00:02:00.540> that<00:02:00.630> faster

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
either greedy or goes for that faster

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
either greedy or goes for that faster
built<00:02:01.170> like<00:02:01.290> if<00:02:01.409> you<00:02:01.500> don't<00:02:01.710> build<00:02:01.950> Marines<00:02:02.759> if

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850

really it seems like the whole entire
new<00:06:11.729> clan<00:06:12.060> is<00:06:12.270> just<00:06:12.449> so<00:06:12.539> the<00:06:12.630> helens<00:06:12.930> could

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.110 
new clan is just so the helens could

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:15.290 
new clan is just so the helens could
actually<00:06:13.229> do<00:06:13.500> something<00:06:13.880> if<00:06:14.880> you<00:06:15.030> guys<00:06:15.150> heard

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:21.840 
strategies like this not to cheese but

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:23.060 
strategies like this not to cheese but
because<00:06:22.020> they're<00:06:22.139> effective<00:06:22.530> and<00:06:22.590> I<00:06:22.740> don't

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
because they're effective and I don't

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:24.890 
because they're effective and I don't
know<00:06:23.160> if<00:06:23.250> he<00:06:23.310> heard<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.639> nuke<00:06:23.849> warning<00:06:24.570> but<00:06:24.810> he
