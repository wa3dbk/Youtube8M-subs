00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:17.219 
that you can definitely fix it so it's

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:19.460 
that you can definitely fix it so it's
just<00:03:17.459> trying<00:03:18.209> to<00:03:18.299> find<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.690> hair<00:03:18.930> texture

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
just trying to find the hair texture

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.509 
just trying to find the hair texture
that<00:03:20.190> a<00:03:20.250> match<00:03:20.699> so<00:03:21.620> your<00:03:22.620> product<00:03:23.159> that<00:03:23.370> will

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
that a match so your product that will

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.000 
that a match so your product that will
probably<00:03:23.909> be<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.090> hardest<00:03:24.449> task<00:03:24.810> on<00:03:25.139> fixing

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
probably be the hardest task on fixing

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.420 
probably be the hardest task on fixing
your<00:03:26.190> unit<00:03:27.169> making<00:03:28.169> sure<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.709> get<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.099> hair

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430

that<00:03:30.060> is<00:03:30.120> going<00:03:30.389> to<00:03:30.449> be<00:03:30.599> similar<00:03:30.900> in<00:03:31.109> texture

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
that is going to be similar in texture

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.979 
that is going to be similar in texture
and<00:03:32.250> that<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.549> hair<00:03:32.790> is<00:03:32.819> going<00:03:33.180> to<00:03:33.329> match<00:03:35.989> but
