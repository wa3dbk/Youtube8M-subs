00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
and this is it's made from bamboo so if

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.070 
and this is it's made from bamboo so if
you're<00:05:33.180> wondering<00:05:33.450> where<00:05:33.570> the<00:05:33.600> stand<00:05:33.960> of

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:34.080 
you're wondering where the stand of

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:35.810 
you're wondering where the stand of
cells<00:05:34.260> are<00:05:34.500> from<00:05:34.710> its<00:05:35.010> from<00:05:35.160> a<00:05:35.190> bamboo<00:05:35.580> plant
