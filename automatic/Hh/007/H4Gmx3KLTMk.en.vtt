00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.190 
you're gonna want to select a matte
color<00:00:38.550> i<00:00:38.850> recommend<00:00:39.300> choosing<00:00:39.480> black<00:00:39.899> just

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
color i recommend choosing black just

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.660 
color i recommend choosing black just
because<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.620> allows<00:00:40.860> the<00:00:41.010> pearlescent<00:00:41.489> color

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
because it allows the pearlescent color

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.580 
because it allows the pearlescent color
to<00:00:41.820> show<00:00:42.030> the<00:00:42.180> best<00:00:42.390> once<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.200> do<00:00:43.320> that<00:00:43.350> you're
