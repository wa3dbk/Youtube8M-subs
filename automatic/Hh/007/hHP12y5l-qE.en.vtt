hi<00:00:02.190> everyone<00:00:02.490> its<00:00:02.820> Danny<00:00:03.060> from<00:00:03.300> work<00:00:03.510> in

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
hi everyone its Danny from work in

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:05.329 
hi everyone its Danny from work in
nature<00:00:03.840> so<00:00:04.470> today<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.069> answer<00:00:05.190> a

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
nature so today we're going to answer a

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:07.639 
nature so today we're going to answer a
question<00:00:05.400> sent<00:00:06.060> in<00:00:06.180> by<00:00:06.359> the<00:00:06.420> Lisa<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.259> I've

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:07.649 
question sent in by the Lisa and I've

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:08.900 
question sent in by the Lisa and I've
never<00:00:07.919> thought<00:00:08.220> about<00:00:08.250> this<00:00:08.670> question

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
never thought about this question

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.660 
never thought about this question
actually<00:00:09.300> and<00:00:09.719> this<00:00:10.260> is<00:00:10.469> why<00:00:10.800> do<00:00:10.860> we<00:00:11.250> need<00:00:11.490> to

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
actually and this is why do we need to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.490 
actually and this is why do we need to
wire<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.179> orchids<00:00:12.540> in<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> morning<00:00:13.259> in<00:00:13.410> order

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
wire the orchids in the morning in order

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.580 
wire the orchids in the morning in order
to<00:00:13.679> be<00:00:14.009> safe<00:00:14.250> from<00:00:14.700> root<00:00:15.030> rot<00:00:15.360> or<00:00:15.719> crown<00:00:16.049> rot<00:00:16.289> or

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
to be safe from root rot or crown rot or

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.410 
to be safe from root rot or crown rot or
stuff<00:00:16.920> like<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.100> okay<00:00:17.970> so<00:00:18.029> let's<00:00:18.330> think

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
stuff like that okay so let's think

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.349 
stuff like that okay so let's think
about<00:00:18.660> things<00:00:19.080> logically<00:00:19.760> okay<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.029> first

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
about things logically okay so first

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.150 
about things logically okay so first
things<00:00:21.630> first<00:00:21.720> if<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.260> water<00:00:22.410> your<00:00:22.680> orchid<00:00:23.070> in

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
things first if you water your orchid in

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.920 
things first if you water your orchid in
the<00:00:23.279> morning<00:00:23.640> time<00:00:23.880> but<00:00:24.090> you're<00:00:24.240> sloppy<00:00:24.810> it

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
the morning time but you're sloppy it

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.689 
the morning time but you're sloppy it
doesn't<00:00:25.320> mean<00:00:25.529> you're<00:00:25.769> super<00:00:26.189> safe<00:00:26.490> from

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
doesn't mean you're super safe from

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.570 
doesn't mean you're super safe from
crown<00:00:27.630> rot<00:00:27.840> or<00:00:28.230> stem<00:00:28.619> rot<00:00:28.830> or<00:00:29.070> stuff<00:00:29.400> like<00:00:29.429> that

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
crown rot or stem rot or stuff like that

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.759 
crown rot or stem rot or stuff like that
so<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.210> need<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> be<00:00:30.689> careful<00:00:30.869> but<00:00:31.560> there's

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
so you do need to be careful but there's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.220 
so you do need to be careful but there's
a<00:00:31.859> logic<00:00:32.669> behind<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:33.270> during<00:00:33.989> day<00:00:34.200> time

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
a logic behind it during day time

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.290 
a logic behind it during day time
usually<00:00:35.040> temperatures<00:00:35.520> are<00:00:35.700> higher<00:00:35.969> than

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
usually temperatures are higher than

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.840 
usually temperatures are higher than
night<00:00:36.510> time<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:37.200> it's<00:00:38.160> it<00:00:38.489> might<00:00:38.700> be

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
night time because it's it might be

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.819 
night time because it's it might be
sunny<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.510> all<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.200> light<00:00:40.379> actually

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
sunny and all the light actually

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.680 
sunny and all the light actually
increases<00:00:41.340> temperature<00:00:41.700> during<00:00:42.450> night<00:00:42.660> time

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
increases temperature during night time

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.420 
increases temperature during night time
there's<00:00:43.230> no<00:00:43.500> lights<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:44.100> increase

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
there's no lights to increase

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.670 
there's no lights to increase
temperature<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.270> actually<00:00:45.840> evaporate<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
temperature and actually evaporate the

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.580 
temperature and actually evaporate the
water<00:00:46.710> so<00:00:47.460> during<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.180> daytime<00:00:48.690> your<00:00:49.050> orchid

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
water so during the daytime your orchid

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.220 
water so during the daytime your orchid
is<00:00:49.770> more<00:00:50.280> prone<00:00:50.640> to<00:00:50.910> have<00:00:51.199> evaporating<00:00:52.199> water

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
is more prone to have evaporating water

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.860 
is more prone to have evaporating water
between<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.219> leaves<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:54.090> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:54.390> nighttime

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
between the leaves then in the nighttime

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.840 
between the leaves then in the nighttime
so<00:00:55.140> that's<00:00:55.410> why<00:00:55.620> everybody<00:00:56.100> says<00:00:56.399> what<00:00:56.760> are

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so that's why everybody says what are

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.000 
so that's why everybody says what are
your<00:00:57.000> orchids<00:00:57.480> as<00:00:57.600> early<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.320> the<00:00:58.469> morning<00:00:58.829> as

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
your orchids as early in the morning as

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.790 
your orchids as early in the morning as
you<00:00:59.280> can<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.730> avoid<00:00:59.760> root<00:01:00.359> rot<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
you can to avoid root rot that's the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.709 
you can to avoid root rot that's the
whole<00:01:02.010> logic<00:01:02.370> behind<00:01:02.520> it<00:01:02.879> you're<00:01:03.390> increasing

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
whole logic behind it you're increasing

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.929 
whole logic behind it you're increasing
your<00:01:03.989> chances<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:04.799> what<00:01:05.489> are<00:01:05.580> actually

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
your chances of what are actually

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.030 
your chances of what are actually
evaporating<00:01:06.510> from<00:01:06.840> whatever<00:01:07.140> crevices<00:01:07.860> it

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
evaporating from whatever crevices it

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.340 
evaporating from whatever crevices it
got<00:01:08.220> into<00:01:08.610> between<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.180> leaves<00:01:09.390> so<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.290> a

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
got into between the leaves so it's a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.429 
got into between the leaves so it's a
good<00:01:10.590> rule<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:10.979> follow<00:01:11.189> but<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.880> not<00:01:12.119> 100%

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:12.439 
good rule to follow but it's not 100%

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:15.410 
good rule to follow but it's not 100%
safe<00:01:13.439> now<00:01:14.310> I<00:01:14.340> don't<00:01:14.640> live<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.850> a<00:01:15.000> perfect<00:01:15.210> world

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
safe now I don't live in a perfect world

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.749 
safe now I don't live in a perfect world
and<00:01:15.840> water<00:01:16.080> gets<00:01:16.439> trapped<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.040> the<00:01:17.070> crown<00:01:17.490> and

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
and water gets trapped in the crown and

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.760 
and water gets trapped in the crown and
in<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.970> stem<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.450> all<00:01:18.540> of<00:01:18.720> that<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.619> best

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
in the stem and all of that so the best

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.980 
in the stem and all of that so the best
thing<00:01:19.950> you<00:01:19.979> can<00:01:20.220> do<00:01:20.400> is<00:01:20.670> take<00:01:20.970> a<00:01:21.240> paper<00:01:21.600> towel

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
thing you can do is take a paper towel

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.350 
thing you can do is take a paper towel
or<00:01:22.290> a<00:01:22.320> napkin<00:01:22.439> and<00:01:23.159> try<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.610> remove<00:01:23.970> as<00:01:24.150> much

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
or a napkin and try to remove as much

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
or a napkin and try to remove as much
water<00:01:24.420> as<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.020> from<00:01:25.380> between<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.830> leaves

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
water as you can from between the leaves

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.890 
water as you can from between the leaves
and<00:01:26.310> the<00:01:26.549> crown<00:01:26.790> whether<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.600> morning

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
and the crown whether it's morning

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.190 
and the crown whether it's morning
afternoon<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.860> nighttime<00:01:29.670> just<00:01:30.420> do<00:01:30.630> this<00:01:30.869> and

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
afternoon or nighttime just do this and

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
afternoon or nighttime just do this and
that<00:01:31.500> will<00:01:31.680> actually<00:01:31.860> keep<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.340> much<00:01:32.579> safer

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
that will actually keep you much safer

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.819 
that will actually keep you much safer
than<00:01:33.270> anything<00:01:33.600> else<00:01:33.930> other<00:01:34.259> than<00:01:34.470> that

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
than anything else other than that

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.130 
than anything else other than that
in<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.640> morning<00:01:36.060> let's<00:01:36.479> say<00:01:36.600> you<00:01:36.659> have<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> bit

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
in the morning let's say you have a bit

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.690 
in the morning let's say you have a bit
more<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.530> than<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.100> rest<00:01:38.250> of<00:01:38.400> the<00:01:38.549> day

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
more time than in the rest of the day

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.399 
more time than in the rest of the day
it's<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.450> good<00:01:39.659> time<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.049> water<00:01:40.229> your

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
it's just a good time to water your

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.090 
it's just a good time to water your
orchids

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
orchids

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.340 
orchids

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
of actually having a healthy orchid now

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.480 
of actually having a healthy orchid now
in<00:01:46.079> low<00:01:46.290> temperatures<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.070> whole<00:01:47.220> morning

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
in low temperatures the whole morning

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.670 
in low temperatures the whole morning
stuff<00:01:47.939> it<00:01:48.420> doesn't<00:01:48.840> work<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.140> great<00:01:49.290> if<00:01:49.590> you

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
stuff it doesn't work so great if you

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.440 
stuff it doesn't work so great if you
have<00:01:49.890> very<00:01:50.159> low<00:01:50.369> temperatures<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.420> water

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
have very low temperatures the water

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.600 
have very low temperatures the water
will<00:01:51.869> not<00:01:51.899> evaporate<00:01:52.470> no<00:01:52.950> matter<00:01:53.130> what<00:01:53.340> you<00:01:53.490> do

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
will not evaporate no matter what you do

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.730 
will not evaporate no matter what you do
so<00:01:54.180> more<00:01:54.420> important<00:01:54.960> than<00:01:55.200> watering<00:01:55.590> your

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
so more important than watering your

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.200 
so more important than watering your
orchids<00:01:56.189> in<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.579> morning<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.090> good

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
orchids in the morning is a good

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.899 
orchids in the morning is a good
ventilation<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.290> can<00:01:58.469> use<00:01:58.619> a<00:01:58.649> fan<00:01:59.040> or<00:01:59.280> keep

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
ventilation you can use a fan or keep

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.389 
ventilation you can use a fan or keep
your<00:02:00.090> windows<00:02:00.540> opened<00:02:01.020> if<00:02:01.380> it's<00:02:01.710> warm<00:02:01.979> if<00:02:02.219> it's

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
your windows opened if it's warm if it's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.370 
your windows opened if it's warm if it's
not<00:02:02.610> warm<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.210> it's<00:02:03.360> very<00:02:03.600> cold<00:02:03.869> then<00:02:04.140> don't

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
not warm if it's very cold then don't

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.609 
not warm if it's very cold then don't
but<00:02:04.710> keep<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.280> fan<00:02:06.000> in<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.360> room<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:07.020> circulate

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
but keep a fan in the room to circulate

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:09.680 
but keep a fan in the room to circulate
the<00:02:07.649> air<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.220> actually<00:02:08.420> increase<00:02:09.420> water

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
the air and actually increase water

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.080 
the air and actually increase water
evaporation<00:02:10.440> and

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
evaporation and

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.240 
evaporation and
that's<00:02:11.480> the<00:02:11.840> best<00:02:12.410> thing<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.680> can<00:02:12.830> do<00:02:13.010> to

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:13.250 
that's the best thing you can do to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.750 
that's the best thing you can do to
avoid<00:02:13.370> crown<00:02:13.970> rot<00:02:14.269> in<00:02:14.599> us<00:02:14.930> all<00:02:15.410> of<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.760> okay

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
avoid crown rot in us all of that okay

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.190 
avoid crown rot in us all of that okay
so<00:02:16.819> thank<00:02:17.120> you<00:02:17.209> for<00:02:17.330> sending<00:02:17.540> in<00:02:17.660> the<00:02:17.780> question

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
so thank you for sending in the question

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.619 
so thank you for sending in the question
it's<00:02:18.860> an<00:02:19.010> easy<00:02:19.160> one<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.030> you<00:02:20.269> know<00:02:20.300> you<00:02:20.450> never

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:20.629 
it's an easy one but you know you never

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.509 
it's an easy one but you know you never
think<00:02:21.050> about<00:02:21.230> stuff<00:02:21.650> logically<00:02:22.190> you<00:02:22.310> just

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:22.519 
think about stuff logically you just

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.130 
think about stuff logically you just
follow<00:02:22.790> some<00:02:22.910> rules<00:02:23.150> but<00:02:23.569> it's<00:02:23.690> better<00:02:23.930> to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
follow some rules but it's better to

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.380 
follow some rules but it's better to
understand<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.769> logic<00:02:24.860> behind<00:02:25.190> it<00:02:25.700> because

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
understand the logic behind it because

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.750 
understand the logic behind it because
for<00:02:26.569> example<00:02:26.660> I<00:02:27.290> in<00:02:27.709> the<00:02:27.890> summertime<00:02:28.340> I<00:02:28.519> water

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
for example I in the summertime I water

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.089 
for example I in the summertime I water
whenever<00:02:29.180> I<00:02:29.330> want<00:02:29.660> and<00:02:30.379> I<00:02:30.470> didn't<00:02:30.739> never<00:02:30.890> had

00:02:31.089 --> 00:02:31.099 
whenever I want and I didn't never had

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:33.369 
whenever I want and I didn't never had
any<00:02:31.280> problems<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:32.299> my<00:02:32.569> summers<00:02:32.930> are<00:02:33.110> really

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
any problems but my summers are really

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.390 
any problems but my summers are really
hot<00:02:33.620> even<00:02:34.220> in<00:02:34.489> the<00:02:34.940> nighttime<00:02:35.390> I<00:02:35.599> still<00:02:35.959> have

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
hot even in the nighttime I still have

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.670 
hot even in the nighttime I still have
24<00:02:37.400> 25<00:02:38.000> degrees<00:02:38.330> in<00:02:38.450> my<00:02:38.540> balcony<00:02:39.049> now<00:02:39.140> at<00:02:39.500> that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
24 25 degrees in my balcony now at that

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.000 
24 25 degrees in my balcony now at that
temperature<00:02:40.250> and<00:02:40.459> evaporation<00:02:41.390> rate<00:02:42.170> and<00:02:42.470> low

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.010 
temperature and evaporation rate and low

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.589 
temperature and evaporation rate and low
humidity<00:02:43.190> and<00:02:43.849> ventilation

00:02:44.589 --> 00:02:44.599 
humidity and ventilation

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:46.360 
humidity and ventilation
I<00:02:44.630> am<00:02:44.840> super<00:02:45.140> safe<00:02:45.349> from<00:02:45.560> crown<00:02:45.799> rot<00:02:45.980> but<00:02:46.250> of

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:46.370 
I am super safe from crown rot but of

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.030 
I am super safe from crown rot but of
course<00:02:46.670> if<00:02:47.000> I<00:02:47.299> water<00:02:47.569> my<00:02:47.780> orchids<00:02:48.290> in<00:02:48.530> the

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
course if I water my orchids in the

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.580 
course if I water my orchids in the
evening<00:02:49.579> during<00:02:50.060> wintertime<00:02:50.420> I'm<00:02:50.870> seriously

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
evening during wintertime I'm seriously

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.229 
evening during wintertime I'm seriously
increasing<00:02:52.040> my<00:02:52.160> chances<00:02:52.190> of<00:02:52.700> having<00:02:52.819> crown

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
increasing my chances of having crown

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.750 
increasing my chances of having crown
rot<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:54.170> think<00:02:54.500> about<00:02:54.620> your<00:02:54.920> environment<00:02:55.280> and

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
rot so think about your environment and

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.180 
rot so think about your environment and
everything<00:02:56.420> logically<00:02:57.049> and<00:02:57.260> this<00:02:57.980> will

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
everything logically and this will

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:59.680 
everything logically and this will
actually<00:02:58.549> increase<00:02:58.849> your<00:02:59.180> chances<00:02:59.540> of

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
actually increase your chances of

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:01.030 
actually increase your chances of
keeping<00:02:59.900> your<00:03:00.170> orchid<00:03:00.500> healthy

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040
