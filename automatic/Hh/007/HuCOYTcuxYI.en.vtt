 games or aram england 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.780
 game ground history begins in 1972 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.080
 years though the main movement went 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.480
 only 10 years later in 1980 with 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:18.180
 localization of 8-bit gaming systems 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.189
 it turns out that they are over forty years old 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.710
 however, what will happen to the consoles yet 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.380
 through go relying only on current 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.490
 facts and your imagination we try 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.720
 imagine a game console taken 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.000
 count specialized electronic 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:36.210
 device designed and built for 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.890
 video games and multimedia playback and 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.250
 current moment claimed 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:45.870
 are 7 and 8 karine gaming consoles 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.670
 we will do this 34 xbox 360 and one steam

 machines nintendo view 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.829
 but also besides the traditional ones on the market 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.760
 up to xl with natural portable gaming 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.180
 devices 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
 this is nintendo 3ds playstation vita and and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.910
 nvidia shield 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.739
 before you go on the action is taken from 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.199
 understand system characteristics 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.460
 to the latest playstation 4 consoles and 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.290
 xbox one 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.450
 although they can not compete 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.260
 gaming yet but not deprived of bowie 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.590
 capacities 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.700
 and in 2015, new nagas appear 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.590
 the device was 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.710
 This and steam machines which can already 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:21.509
 curated and only with game consoles 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.580
 legs for some reason for example 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.070
 the user will be able to modify 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.170
 setting them to process a video card 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.720
 RAM and hard disk on 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.250
 your taste and wallet size 100 thousand 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.920
 Note such a device as nvidia 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.540
 shield 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.490
 Pro can run games from computer in 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.200
 anywhere in the world the image will be 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.140
 broadcast to the console via wifi 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.720
 and the same consoles will see in 10 years 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.430
 birch example for me something devices 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.320
 and nvidia shield and modern 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.360
 Internet capabilities that say 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:52.600
 getting faster you can 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.729
 assume that the 2025 device 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.399
 in the morning he and dual modes first 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.960
 look year in front of the TV 2 this 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.759
 game from any convenient place 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.409
 connect an additional device 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:04.659
 via the internet mostly 

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.970
 gebo structures even turn to change 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.369
 there will be none already all accustomed however 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.560
 more part after the bridge decide to change 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.989
 them on new peripherals form 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.769
 virtual reality costumes 

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:19.600
 also played on 7 player actions 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:22.959
 most likely it can already happen 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:25.269
 near the end of the tenth of its 11th generation 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:26.470
 After all, all the prototypes are available and necessary 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.600
 just bring to mind 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.190
 to bring on for the final 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.870
 user as for 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.730
 performance graph ends not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.890
 the boundaries can become begin portable 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.989
 computers and it is quite logical 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.850
 given the characteristics that they 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:42.820
 set now can be assumed 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.980
 approximate numbers in 10 years so type 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.310
 processors will have 30 in-house core 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.630
 whole glass frequency of 4 GHz 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.310
 operational memory of such individuals is clearly 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.280
 him and less than one hundred and twenty eight 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 gigabyte so hard volume 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:59.210
 The disks will be at least ten firewood and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.130
 As for the graphic features 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.320
 onions speak hard but most likely they 

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:04.010
 too will be three four times higher than 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.110
 now 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.460
 played seem ordinary however 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.100
 like technical characteristics 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.320
 computers 10-15 years ago yet 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.670
 progress is moving even faster however 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:15.080
 there is an important question whether 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:16.610
 game developers seek 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.490
 maximum interaction between 

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:23.000
 users of the game world, I think that 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.440
 yes, but then you can let bio 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.300
 about steam machines can 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.490
 assume that the players themselves will 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.140
 pick these devices based on 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.440
 preferences and financial capabilities 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:35.660
 which is definitely more correct compactness and 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:37.460
 then I forced the console and size 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.910
 there will obviously be no more those that they have 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:40.040
 now 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.530
 but before the sick device by the beginnings he 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.540
 takes decent more can not get 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.430
 accommodates input wheels to transport with 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:49.550
 myself, but I think it's just a question 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.550
 time if the battle said that thirty 

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:55.040
 the fifth year of the gaming costume helmet 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.180
 controller and became more accessible and 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:01.640
 more convenient to the last issue of video games 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:04.250
 in 10 years we have offered you 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.650
 write your assumptions about video games 

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.340
 after 10 years and here is the most interesting 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:11.000
 comment 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:13.430
 Alex lightly writes the idea of virtual 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.100
 helmets were still in the seventies and in the 90s 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.390
 or films that are similar members 

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.940
 now the same reality was involved 

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:20.930
 then there was a movie for which you showed 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.270
 virtual reality 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:25.970
 which is like the type after the helmet now 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.670
 there are they masters of the sword in which too 

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:30.470
 shows the agent of the virtual world on 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:32.570
 Based on this, I can assume that 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.090
 the Japanese will be more interesting 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.430
 technology us sound and visual 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.690
 information they persuade helmets which 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.930
 now they will be there for metal therefore 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.300
 when I remember at the beginning was the IR port 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.210
 bluetooth now wi-fi will be the same with 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:51.699
 these technologies will make the member 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.919
 developers looking for other ways to transfer 

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:58.479
 information and the result does not take long 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.430
 remember that everything I said is 

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:02.949
 only reasoning on the rack factor 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:05.320
 which we now have the world rapidly 

00:05:02.949 --> 00:05:08.050
 changing and can and you put absolutely 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:10.090
 new why not even know about the budget 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.580
 comments your assumptions about 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.490
 like the console on in 10 years and myself 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.870
 interesting show in the next issue 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:19.720
 just subscribe to our youtube channel 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:21.250
 and of course in the hands of VKontakte month 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:23.860
 follow us on twitter 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:28.860
 also see asphalt their appearance 

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.860
 horizontal bars and video games after 10 bye 

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.290
