do<00:03:50.540> you<00:03:50.600> think<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:51.140> the<00:03:51.290> fashion<00:03:51.470> industry

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
do you think that the fashion industry

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:54.040 
do you think that the fashion industry
can<00:03:52.460> change<00:03:52.820> or<00:03:52.940> do<00:03:53.030> you<00:03:53.120> think<00:03:53.150> it's<00:03:53.570> it's

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:54.050 
can change or do you think it's it's

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:56.650 
can change or do you think it's it's
partially<00:03:54.710> I<00:03:54.740> think<00:03:55.160> the<00:03:55.400> consumers<00:03:56.000> fault

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
partially I think the consumers fault

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.420 
partially I think the consumers fault
because<00:03:56.900> we<00:03:57.230> are<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> ones<00:03:57.620> trying<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.190> chase

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
because we are the ones trying to chase

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.340 
because we are the ones trying to chase
that<00:03:58.640> or<00:03:58.760> we<00:03:59.240> have<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.570> power<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.960> change<00:04:00.200> it

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:00.350 
that or we have the power to change it

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:02.740 
that or we have the power to change it
don't<00:04:00.440> you<00:04:00.590> think<00:04:00.830> yeah<00:04:01.430> we<00:04:01.700> do<00:04:01.970> I<00:04:02.209> think<00:04:02.480> you
