the deserts of the southwest are some of
the<00:00:10.410> most<00:00:10.559> beautiful<00:00:10.980> and<00:00:11.570> biologically

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
conditions are normal in these arid

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.910 
conditions are normal in these arid
regions<00:00:17.940> and<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.480> indigenous<00:00:18.869> species<00:00:19.439> have

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
regions and the indigenous species have

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.980 
regions and the indigenous species have
adapted<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.490> these<00:00:20.699> harsh<00:00:21.029> environments<00:00:21.810> in

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
and urban areas there was less water

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.189 
and urban areas there was less water
available<00:00:44.039> for<00:00:44.730> wildlife<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.480> what<00:00:45.960> water

available for wildlife and what water
was<00:00:46.500> available<00:00:46.680> was<00:00:47.430> more<00:00:47.699> difficult<00:00:47.910> for

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
was available was more difficult for

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.930 
was available was more difficult for
them<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.629> get<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:49.140> personally<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.340> feel<00:00:50.879> like

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
them to get to personally I feel like

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.319 
them to get to personally I feel like
that<00:00:51.980> we<00:00:52.980> have<00:00:53.219> altered<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.670> landscape<00:00:53.879> by

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
that we have altered the landscape by

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.169 
that we have altered the landscape by
our<00:00:54.449> presence<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.980> fragmented<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.670> landscape

00:00:57.169 --> 00:00:57.179 
our presence we fragmented the landscape

00:00:57.179 --> 00:01:00.380 
our presence we fragmented the landscape
so<00:00:57.629> many<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> natural<00:00:58.980> corridors<00:00:59.399> where

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
so many of the natural corridors where

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.119 
so many of the natural corridors where
wildlife<00:01:00.780> could<00:01:01.079> get<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.350> water<00:01:01.559> are<00:01:01.890> now

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
wildlife could get to water are now

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.910 
wildlife could get to water are now
closed<00:01:02.519> and<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.660> we're<00:01:03.809> probably<00:01:04.019> providing<00:01:04.830> a

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
closed and so we're probably providing a

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.190 
closed and so we're probably providing a
source<00:01:05.160> that<00:01:05.309> some<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.790> these<00:01:05.910> animals<00:01:06.390> could

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
source that some of these animals could

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.010 
source that some of these animals could
get<00:01:07.380> would<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.830> gotten<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.280> historically<00:01:09.020> so

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
get would have gotten to historically so

get a water truck to this site and
occasionally<00:02:13.110> during<00:02:13.290> drought<00:02:13.800> years<00:02:14.280> the

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
occasionally during drought years the

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.390 
occasionally during drought years the
old<00:02:15.120> system<00:02:15.569> would<00:02:16.170> require<00:02:16.590> water<00:02:16.950> hauling

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
old system would require water hauling

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.300 
old system would require water hauling
and<00:02:17.930> that<00:02:18.930> would<00:02:19.260> sometimes<00:02:19.709> result<00:02:20.160> in

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
and that would sometimes result in

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.729 
and that would sometimes result in
busted<00:02:20.790> tires<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.420> broken<00:02:21.750> equipment<00:02:21.959> so<00:02:22.470> we

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
busted tires and broken equipment so we

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.040 
busted tires and broken equipment so we
hope<00:02:23.100> to<00:02:23.250> save<00:02:23.430> a<00:02:23.640> great<00:02:23.819> deal<00:02:24.000> of<00:02:24.030> money<00:02:24.300> by

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
hope to save a great deal of money by

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.680 
hope to save a great deal of money by
building<00:02:25.830> an<00:02:25.950> efficient<00:02:26.430> system<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:27.060> we<00:02:27.540> can

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
building an efficient system that we can

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.229 
building an efficient system that we can
avoid<00:02:27.930> water<00:02:28.290> hauling<00:02:28.709> with<00:02:28.860> at<00:02:29.640> some<00:02:29.970> water

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
avoid water hauling with at some water

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.910 
avoid water hauling with at some water
catchments<00:02:30.959> cameras<00:02:31.500> have<00:02:31.709> been<00:02:31.860> installed

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
catchments cameras have been installed

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.550 
catchments cameras have been installed
so<00:02:32.700> the<00:02:32.730> department<00:02:33.390> can<00:02:33.569> see<00:02:33.810> who's<00:02:34.080> using

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
so the department can see who's using

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.340 
so the department can see who's using
them<00:02:34.739> and<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.489> this<00:02:35.700> video<00:02:36.090> shows<00:02:36.450> just<00:02:36.780> about

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
them and as this video shows just about

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.190 
them and as this video shows just about

and<00:02:49.590> get<00:02:49.860> wet

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
and get wet

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040 
and get wet
oh<00:02:50.310> we<00:02:50.970> feel<00:02:51.120> like<00:02:51.330> it's<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.630> good<00:02:51.780> thing

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
oh we feel like it's a good thing

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.960 
oh we feel like it's a good thing
because<00:02:52.230> we're<00:02:52.620> stewards<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.310> land<00:02:53.340> and

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
because we're stewards of the land and

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.000 
because we're stewards of the land and
it<00:02:54.150> does<00:02:54.330> provide<00:02:54.690> a<00:02:55.200> water<00:02:55.560> source<00:02:55.800> for

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
it does provide a water source for

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.680 
it does provide a water source for
wildlife<00:02:56.400> in<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:56.760> time<00:02:56.970> of<00:02:57.090> drought<00:02:57.300> which

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
wildlife in the time of drought which

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.100 
wildlife in the time of drought which
obviously<00:02:58.320> we've<00:02:58.620> had<00:02:58.800> an<00:02:58.950> extended<00:02:59.580> drought

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.110 
obviously we've had an extended drought

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:02.420 
obviously we've had an extended drought
we'd<00:03:01.110> certainly<00:03:01.470> don't<00:03:01.590> see<00:03:01.800> it<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.100> being

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
we'd certainly don't see it as being

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:04.040 
we'd certainly don't see it as being
something<00:03:02.670> bad<00:03:02.970> we're<00:03:03.420> very<00:03:03.660> pleased<00:03:03.930> with

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
something bad we're very pleased with

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.199 
something bad we're very pleased with
this<00:03:04.230> new<00:03:04.440> design<00:03:04.830> because<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.280> is<00:03:05.459> completely

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
this new design because it is completely

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:09.530 
this new design because it is completely
subterranean<00:03:07.200> and<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.239> larger

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
subterranean and with the larger

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.840 
subterranean and with the larger
capacity<00:03:10.170> it<00:03:10.350> requires<00:03:10.709> less<00:03:10.950> maintenance

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:13.850 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:16.039 

projects<00:03:14.850> like<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.299> would<00:03:15.570> be<00:03:15.600> impossible

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
projects like this would be impossible

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:18.170 
projects like this would be impossible
for<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.680> department<00:03:17.250> to<00:03:17.430> build<00:03:17.700> and<00:03:17.940> maintain
