00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
anyway so that is falling apart but when

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
anyway so that is falling apart but when
that<00:01:57.450> happened<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.869> was<00:01:58.049> pretty<00:01:58.409> devastated<00:01:58.619> I

his name I might put it in the
description<00:04:45.830> below<00:04:46.250> but<00:04:46.940> he's<00:04:47.660> got<00:04:47.840> a<00:04:47.870> lot<00:04:48.140> of

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:48.170 
description below but he's got a lot of

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.810 
description below but he's got a lot of
stuff<00:04:48.440> to<00:04:48.560> do<00:04:48.710> and<00:04:48.860> a<00:04:49.250> lot<00:04:49.400> of<00:04:49.460> people<00:04:49.670> asked

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
stuff to do and a lot of people asked

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.150 
stuff to do and a lot of people asked
him<00:04:49.940> for<00:04:50.120> things<00:04:50.330> and<00:04:50.630> so<00:04:50.990> I<00:04:51.350> figured<00:04:51.800> probably

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
him for things and so I figured probably

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.860 
him for things and so I figured probably
best<00:04:52.460> to<00:04:52.610> leave<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.850> out<00:04:53.060> because<00:04:53.270> he<00:04:53.600> probably

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
best to leave it out because he probably

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.540 
best to leave it out because he probably
doesn't<00:04:54.200> want<00:04:54.320> to<00:04:54.350> be<00:04:54.410> bugged<00:04:54.890> by<00:04:55.220> a<00:04:55.250> million
