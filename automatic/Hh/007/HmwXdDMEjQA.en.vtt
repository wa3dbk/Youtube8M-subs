00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.450
 there are people there are people doing a 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.220
 tutorial on how to download 64 bits in 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.440
 general in minecraft 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.870
 I'm doing a new one because the 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.320
 old is already a little old the quality 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.080
 of sound is not the best nor is 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.830
 good the video is fine but it is a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.779
 little badly edited and so on the case what 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.790
 first what to do to install 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:31.130
 the flame 64 bits and accelerate the minecraft 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:35.430
 is if you have the 32 bits uninstall it 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.540
 you also have to see if your computer is 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.510
 64 bits for that you give the team 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:45.510
 properties and here you will kind of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:48.420
 64-bit operating system system and 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.120
 if that is because it is 64 bits and here 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 you can see the branch that has it in mind 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:00.090
 I have 8 gb of ram it may seem 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.240
 4 5 4 6 12 16 if you are a computer in the 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.930
 host 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:06.220
 2 Even the case is that you have to go to 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.680
 this page that I will put it to the 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.600
 description that is the official flame and 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.100
 it has been downloaded to windows offline 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.270
 64 bits that is the 64 bit java 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.710
 first you have to uninstall the old 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.710
 java if it is 32 bits 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.970
 you give it to me and it's downloading 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.340
 if you want I'm not going to cut it here and 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.290
 Now I come back well when there are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.290
 downloaded you give here 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.190
 and we continue with the installation as if 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.430
 was the habbany normal and current not 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:49.650
 there is nothing different is going to install 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.450
 carries out the following and so on 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.970
 install just like the other one that is from 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.130
 64 bits and well this part I'm going to 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.350
 happen 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.450
 and now I go back again 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.920
 well when you already have it installed 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:07.950
 you can close the java you have to give 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.460
 control panel and you should look at 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.150
 small icons 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.020
 and you look where it is already going here you give it 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.910
 with the left click 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.280
 and here is the java control panel 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:23.170
 this do not touch it you let it put in 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.730
 java and visualize that they are in the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.800
 configuration and time pressures 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:30.640
 of the execution of java 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:32.770
 for applets and applications already go for 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.310
 see the ram and the power applied to each 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.280
 java application and this is where it comes in 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.200
 what ram I said before I had 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.900
 that you remember the start you have for 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.170
 example if you have 8 gigas as I put 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:50.710
 half of 8 gb a gigabyte is equal to 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.560
 1024 megas knowing that can be done 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:56.680
 a rule of 3 very easily I have 

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.960
 done mentally and if it does not appear 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.850
 nothing does not happen anything you put this I 'm going 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.060
 to put in the description if not you 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:09.760
 nothing appears because you do not have to put 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.700
 from this and the megas depends on 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:16.599
 the ram you have the number this one 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:19.599
 for example if you have a gb you can put 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.730
 how can you put a jig you do not put it 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:25.610
 all because a gig is not much if 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.370
 you have two you put 1024 half 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.860
 if you have four in the middle again 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:37.190
 that would be 2048 and so on 

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:40.730
 you accept to accept and when you start 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:43.640
 the minecraft will not only be better but 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.260
 the symbol is the one that puts minecraft 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.069
 you need it 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.319
 It takes 64 bits and appears to us as 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:55.930
 you can see when you open the minecraft if 

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:58.780
 opens if you want if you feel like 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:00.609
 it seems that you do not feel like good anymore 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.900
 you know more or less as a teacher I'm going to 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:06.390
 see if it has already opened 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:09.209
 this same I'm using the pack of 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.550
 kraft puree textures is one of my 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.970
 favorites 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:18.280
 and as you can see it's not going badly for me and I'm 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.280
 recording with qantas already study and 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:25.780
 I do not seem to doubt you need the 64 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.190
 bits because I installed it and well this 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:29.190
 it has been everything and goodbye
