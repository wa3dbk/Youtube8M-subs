00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.850
 hello welcome to another tuto Tuesday are 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.549
 leonardo pÃ©rez grandson and I have a 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.429
 news art fun now has a 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:12.780
 blog I invite you to visit it because 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.940
 there I will be putting information 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.090
 like in which I was inspired to be this 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.910
 artwork or the list of materials and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 things of interest the link is here 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.200
 down 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.430
 today I'm going to draw a rose that I like 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.430
 you want to get out of paper 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 Start by tracing stems and leaves 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:38.370
 of the three roses that I'm going to draw 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:51.800
 the first rose is going to be almost a button and 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.800
 will have petals on both sides 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.040
 the second one will be similar but with 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.130
 its petals as spiral one on the 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.130
 other 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.729
 I put some small leaves in the base 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.570
 i 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:22.390
 and the third one is going to be a little bit more 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:22.390
 open and turned towards us 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.130
 detailed the leaves 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.850
 now I start to shadow the parts that 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.550
 they are further back or further in they go more 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.980
 dark 

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.880
 and blurred what I did with a brush 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.230
 soft as I left some spots 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:06.440
 cleaned them with a moldable eraser 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:09.170
 after the edges of a sheet of paper in 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:11.870
 Where are the roses going to be? 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.150
 the middle one paper but not exceeding 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.720
 the other then I do a little more 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.720
 chaparrita 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.739
 I'm going to try to have the middle one 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.470
 certain volume that looks like it 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.540
 is coming out of the paper while the 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.080
 two others are simply going to be 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.080
 traced 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:42.730
 I also make shadows to my sheet of 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:46.269
 fictional paper to make it look more real 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.049
 with some shadows something strong should 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.049
 start to stand out 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.940
 now lit the background 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.180
 He passed him a cotton to blur what 

00:02:56.959 --> 00:03:02.720
 I also get on the paper to give it a 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.720
 slight tone 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:10.170
 delineated the edge a little better and I give it 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.959
 some shadows to highlight points 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.030
 specific in this case as if the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:19.209
 paper were getting up 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.220
 and with the draft I take out lights to give the 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.220
 illusion that the paper is wavy 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.200
 I'm going to outline the line so that it looks 

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:31.200
 best 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.610
 took out some more lights 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:52.490
 This shadow did not like me that much 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.490
 I'm going to erase it 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.909
 Y 

00:03:55.220 --> 00:04:01.810
 I decided to put another two sheets and one 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.810
 smallest shadow 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:05.050
 do not 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.860
 the BOM can 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.860
 find on the blog 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.299
 to 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.740
 the stem I need to look more like a 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:35.740
 cylinder so I work in that 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.290
 Y 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.940
 tuned the last details and ready me 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.940
 I would love to know what you thought 

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:07.389
