00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.566
- AS YOU KNOW,
MY SHOW IS POPULAR

00:00:01.566 --> 00:00:03.100
WITH PEOPLE OF ALL AGES
AND CATS,

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.666
AND I'VE NOTICED THERE ARE A LOT
OF COLLEGE STUDENTS

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:06.966
WHO WATCH MY SHOW,

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.800
AND I'VE BEEN ASKING THEM
TO WRITE IN AND TELL ME

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.333
WHY THEY ARE MY BIGGEST FAN.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:11.800
WE'VE HAD THOUSANDS
OF SUBMISSIONS,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.366
BUT THIS ONE IS ONE
THAT STOOD OUT FOR ME.

00:00:14.366 --> 00:00:17.633
AND IT SAYS, "HI, ELLEN,
MY NAME IS KRISTEN LOPES.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:21.066
"I'M A JUNIOR AT MARIST COLLEGE
IN POUGHKEEPSIE, NEW YORK.

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:24.200
"I WATCH YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY,
SOMETIMES MULTIPLE TIMES A DAY.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.300
"I LIVE IN A HOUSE WITH SEVEN
OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.666
"AND I--WHO ALSO LOVE YOU.

00:00:28.666 --> 00:00:30.833
"WHO WOULD RATHER--
WE WOULD RATHER WATCH YOUR SHOW

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.266
"ON A FRIDAY NIGHT
THAN GO OUT.

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:34.100
"IF THAT DOESN'T TELL YOU
HOW GREAT YOU ARE,

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.366
"THEN I DON'T KNOW
WHAT DOES.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:37.366
"WE ALSO ALL SCHEDULE
OUR CLASSES

00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:39.633
"SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING
FROM 4:00 TO 5:00 P.M.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:41.066
"WHEN YOUR SHOW COMES ON.

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:43.833
ELLEN, WE LOVE YOU
AND HOPE TO HEAR FROM YOU SOON."

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.233
I READ THAT,
AND I WAS LIKE,

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:46.466
WELL, THEN I HAVE
TO MEET THEM,"

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:48.100
SO RIGHT NOW,
KRISTEN AND HER FRIENDS

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.066
THINK I'M ABOUT TO SKYPE
WITH A PRODUCER ON THE SHOW.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.533
THAT PRODUCER IS ME,

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:56.266
AND I'M GONNA SURPRISE THEM
RIGHT NOW.

00:00:58.633 --> 00:00:59.633
KRISTEN.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.700
[all screeching and cheering]

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.700
[cheers and applause]

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.100
- HI, KRISTEN!

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.100
[all screaming and cheering]

00:01:14.566 --> 00:01:15.700
- HI.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.700
[all screaming]

00:01:20.033 --> 00:01:22.466
- HI.
WHAT ARE Y'ALL DOING?

00:01:22.466 --> 00:01:26.100
[all screaming]

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.100
- OH, MY GOD!
- HI, KRISTEN.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.433
OKAY.

00:01:29.433 --> 00:01:31.433
- OH, MY GOSH.
- I'M EXCITED TOO.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:33.733
I'M EXCITED TO SEE YOU.
- ELLEN!

00:01:33.733 --> 00:01:34.733
[all scream]

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:35.733
- KRISTEN, WHO'S WHO?

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:38.000
INTRODUCE ME
TO EVERYBODY.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.400
- I'M KIRSTEN.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.266
- [screams]

00:01:41.266 --> 00:01:42.933
- THESE ARE MY HOUSEMATES.

00:01:42.933 --> 00:01:45.100
- I'M GABRIELLA.
I'M FROM LONG ISLAND.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.466
- I'M CAROLINE.
I'M FROM NEW YORK.

00:01:46.466 --> 00:01:48.400

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.333
- I'M JULIA.
I'M FROM JERSEY.

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.066
- I'M ELLEN.
I'M FROM LONG ISLAND.

00:01:52.066 --> 00:01:53.600
- I'M ANGELA.
I'M FROM LONG ISLAND.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.900
- [speaking indistinctly]

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:56.900
- HI, I'M--

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:57.933
[all scream]

00:01:57.933 --> 00:01:59.833
[laughter]

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:00.933
[all talking at once]

00:02:00.933 --> 00:02:02.866
- LISTEN.

00:02:02.866 --> 00:02:05.300
SO--SO WE'RE SHOOTING A SHOW
RIGHT NOW,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.266
AND I JUST READ YOUR LETTER
TO THE AUDIENCE,

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.866
AND I THOUGHT
IT WAS A REALLY COOL LETTER.

00:02:08.866 --> 00:02:12.433
AND I READ THAT YOU SCHEDULE
YOUR CLASSES AROUND MY SHOW

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:14.133
SO THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY
WATCH MY SHOW.

00:02:14.133 --> 00:02:16.633
[all screaming]

00:02:16.633 --> 00:02:19.333
- 4:00.
- THAT'S GREAT.

00:02:19.333 --> 00:02:20.766
IT'S GOOD TO SEE
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE

00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:23.033
HAVE THEIR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT,
AND I THINK THAT'S--

00:02:23.033 --> 00:02:24.100
[laughter]

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.666
YOU'RE OFF
TO A GOOD START.

00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.166
SO, LISTEN,
I WISH YOU COULD BE HERE.

00:02:28.166 --> 00:02:30.000
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVE
WHAT YOU'RE MISSING.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.633
IT'S ACTUALLY DAY THREE
OF OUR 12 DAYS OF GIVEAWAYS,

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:34.933
AND YOU CAN'T BE HERE FOR THAT,
WHICH IS REALLY A SHAME,

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:36.333
BUT I HAD AN IDEA.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:38.733
SINCE YOU CAN'T BE HERE,
I'M GONNA BRING 12 DAYS TO YOU.

00:02:38.733 --> 00:02:40.100
SO A LITTLE LATER
IN THE SHOW,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.166
I'M GONNA GIVE THE AUDIENCE
SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF,

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:43.733
AND WE'LL SKYPE BACK IN,

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:46.166
AND YOU'RE GONNA GET EVERYTHING
THAT I'M GIVING THE AUDIENCE.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.166
ALL OF IT, OKAY?

00:02:47.166 --> 00:02:51.000
[cheers and applause]

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.366
I HAVE ONE MORE SURPRISE
FOR ALL OF YOU, OKAY?

00:02:53.366 --> 00:02:55.433
YOU'RE GONNA PLAY A GAME
RIGHT NOW--A BIG PRIZE.

00:02:55.433 --> 00:02:57.500
IT'S GONNA BE A TRIP
TO CALIFORNIA TO SEE MY SHOW,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.500
AND HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.300
[all screaming]

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.466
- OKAY, I SENT YOU EACH
A BOX OF KLEENEX.

00:03:04.466 --> 00:03:06.200
PUT THE BOX OF KLEENEX
IN FRONT OF YOU.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.600
EACH HAVE A BOX
OF KLEENEX, OKAY?

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.266
THE FIRST PERSON
TO EMPTY THEIR BOX

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.766
BY PULLING OUT A TISSUE
ONE AT A TIME--

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.500
ONLY ONE AT A TIME--

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.133
IS GONNA WIN.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:19.300
I HAVE ONE TICKET
TO GIVE AWAY.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.133
READY, SET, GO.

00:03:21.133 --> 00:03:23.133
ONE AT A TIME.
PULL 'EM OUT.

00:03:23.133 --> 00:03:29.500
[frantic music playing]

00:03:33.566 --> 00:03:36.566
[all shouting]

00:03:37.566 --> 00:03:40.800
- YOU GOT IT.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.100
WHO--WHO GOT IT FIRST?

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.266
- WHOO!
- WHO GOT--

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.866
YOU GOT IT FIRST, RIGHT?

00:03:46.866 --> 00:03:48.466
OKAY, CONGRATULATIONS.
YOU'RE GONNA--

00:03:48.466 --> 00:03:50.233
WE'RE GONNA FLY YOU OUT
TO BEAUTIFUL BURBANK

00:03:50.233 --> 00:03:51.700
TO SEE A TAPING
OF MY SHOW.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.700
[all scream]

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.800
- I KNOW.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:55.833
HEY, ALSO,

00:03:55.833 --> 00:03:58.733

[cheers and applause]
