00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:06.110 

now<00:05:02.820> that<00:05:03.060> we<00:05:03.150> have<00:05:03.180> these<00:05:03.570> smashed<00:05:04.940> now<00:05:05.940> that

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
now that we have these smashed now that

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.660 
now that we have these smashed now that
these<00:05:06.270> are<00:05:06.420> smashed<00:05:06.890> we<00:05:07.890> test<00:05:08.160> out<00:05:08.310> the<00:05:08.490> heat

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
these are smashed we test out the heat

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:32.190 
these are smashed we test out the heat
again<00:05:09.140> one<00:05:11.270> put<00:05:12.270> these<00:05:12.450> right<00:05:12.480> back<00:05:12.810> in<00:05:13.020> here

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:32.200 

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.630 

this<00:05:33.200> process<00:05:33.470> is<00:05:33.800> really<00:05:34.010> important<00:05:34.490> because

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
this process is really important because

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:38.110 
this process is really important because
if<00:05:35.600> the<00:05:35.720> heat<00:05:35.960> is<00:05:36.140> too<00:05:36.380> low<00:05:36.650> then<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.880> black

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
if the heat is too low then the black

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.360 
if the heat is too low then the black
down<00:05:38.330> sucks<00:05:38.660> up<00:05:38.840> too<00:05:39.020> much<00:05:39.200> oil<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.890> you<00:05:40.190> have

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.370 
down sucks up too much oil and you have

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:42.340 
down sucks up too much oil and you have
like<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.580> really<00:05:40.790> soggy<00:05:41.210> play<00:05:41.660> I'm<00:05:41.810> postponing

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:42.350 
like a really soggy play I'm postponing

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.180 
like a really soggy play I'm postponing
you<00:05:43.040> have<00:05:43.160> a<00:05:43.190> grill<00:05:43.580> soggy<00:05:44.200> plantain<00:05:45.200> and<00:05:45.470> you

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
you have a grill soggy plantain and you

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.120 
you have a grill soggy plantain and you
don't<00:05:46.340> want<00:05:46.520> that<00:05:46.610> so<00:05:47.440> this<00:05:48.440> here<00:05:48.680> part<00:05:49.010> of<00:05:49.070> the

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:49.130 
don't want that so this here part of the

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:50.680 
don't want that so this here part of the
process<00:05:49.310> it<00:05:49.700> doesn't<00:05:50.030> matter<00:05:50.210> that<00:05:50.330> he

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
process it doesn't matter that he
