00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.059
 hello in today's video let's see what 

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.809
 colors are better to our tone 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:18.760
 skin or tends to a cold tone that 

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:21.939
 it would be the blue areas or our tone 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:24.160
 of skin tends to yellow that would be 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:27.460
 the warm colors the colors 

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:31.449
 They are the primary skin pigment the 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.520
 red the yellow and the blue with these 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.820
 three colors we will know what 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.879
 colors fit our skin better 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:41.890
 here made a scheme so that you know 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:45.129
 you see the pigment colors that is the 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.899
 red the blue and yellow with red the 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.109
 orange fabric with red and blue 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:53.530
 make violet and blue and yellow a 

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:55.629
 cmt for example I am more pulling more 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.800
 that's why I prefer the colors 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.770
 warm 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:04.550
 the girls with the cold tone are left 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:08.460
 much better the blue tones 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:12.690
 the violet athlete has climbed the green 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.970
 and above all, it is very good fuchsia 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.370
 that we have warm skin tone we 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:25.550
 all yellow ranges are better 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:27.020
 oranges red salmon salmon good 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.380
 the roses 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.080
 I thought they were warm tones but not 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.630
 outside was left to the girls who 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.760
 they have a colder skin tone that are 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.530
 whiter and sucking them like skin 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.660
 a little more bluish that makeup 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.600
 we repeat cold tonality that he wants 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.190
 say that the people who have the tune 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:50.770
 of skin plus pulling bluish that 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.560
 the blue violets would be fine 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.320
 green and all the different ranges 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.710
 up and down and the rector of 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.610
 quality from the reds the yellows 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.670
 the oranges 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.530
 roses depends on roses to those cold 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.590
 also bad ballistics very well and 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:12.050
 then we have the colors that almost everything 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.319
 the world can take that are the 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:19.439
 golden silver and gold 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.450
 brown skin tones not any 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.400
 better with your hair against your 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.519
 makeup is not the same makeup that 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:28.889
 in skin tone is to betis and now 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:31.230
 we see for example the blue in theory 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:33.770
 because I have warm skin 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.020
 I do not have to look good 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.590
 so what can we do to make 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:42.690
 It is good to paint our faces with some 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.580
 tones plus blue ones then already 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.160
 I would paste a little more 

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.010
 then we put more colors on a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.970
 tonality 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.490
 dark 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.640
 a shadow that is with pigments 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.510
 bluish then we can go with these 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.900
 colors and I leave my advice I hope 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.410
 that has helped you a lot until the 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.410
 next
