00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:29.539 
great about this example is that she
probably<00:02:26.010> wasn't<00:02:26.489> lying<00:02:26.989> she<00:02:27.989> is<00:02:28.230> human<00:02:28.739> she

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
probably wasn't lying she is human she

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:33.170 
probably wasn't lying she is human she
made<00:02:29.760> a<00:02:29.790> mistake<00:02:30.030> a<00:02:30.569> really<00:02:31.159> big<00:02:32.159> mistake

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
made a mistake a really big mistake

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.199 
made a mistake a really big mistake
in<00:02:33.629> the<00:02:33.780> end<00:02:33.930> it<00:02:34.140> didn't<00:02:34.439> hurt<00:02:34.620> anybody<00:02:35.189> but<00:02:36.030> it

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
in the end it didn't hurt anybody but it

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.170 
in the end it didn't hurt anybody but it
shows<00:02:36.810> that<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.319> having<00:02:38.099> intelligence<00:02:38.879> having

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
shows that it having intelligence having

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.890 
shows that it having intelligence having
education<00:02:40.170> having<00:02:40.739> experience<00:02:41.640> being<00:02:42.569> in<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
education having experience being in the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.289 
education having experience being in the
public<00:02:43.290> eye<00:02:43.439> for<00:02:43.470> a<00:02:43.829> long<00:02:44.099> time<00:02:44.459> doesn't

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
public eye for a long time doesn't

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.860 
public eye for a long time doesn't
protect<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.230> from<00:02:47.220> having<00:02:47.730> what<00:02:48.090> we're<00:02:48.690> now

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
protect you from having what we're now

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.420 
protect you from having what we're now
calling<00:02:49.170> very<00:02:50.069> rich<00:02:50.599> false<00:02:51.599> memories<00:02:52.400> so<00:02:53.400> I

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
calling very rich false memories so I

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.330 
calling very rich false memories so I
want<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:53.940> tell<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.299> a<00:02:54.329> little<00:02:54.510> bit<00:02:54.659> about<00:02:55.340> my

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
want to tell you a little bit about my

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.059 
want to tell you a little bit about my
work<00:02:56.370> on<00:02:56.940> false<00:02:57.269> memories<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.290> in<00:02:58.680> doing

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
work on false memories and and in doing

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:02.479 
work on false memories and and in doing
so<00:02:59.370> it's<00:03:00.359> just<00:03:00.629> my<00:03:00.930> particular<00:03:01.260> interest<00:03:02.220> in

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
so it's just my particular interest in

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.289 
so it's just my particular interest in
this<00:03:02.670> field<00:03:02.730> I<00:03:03.299> tend<00:03:03.659> to<00:03:03.810> look<00:03:04.220> to<00:03:05.220> legal<00:03:05.700> cases

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
this field I tend to look to legal cases

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:10.149 
this field I tend to look to legal cases
as<00:03:06.599> an<00:03:07.260> important<00:03:07.739> application<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.750> work

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
as an important application of the work

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:13.309 
as an important application of the work
because<00:03:11.159> it's<00:03:11.430> in<00:03:11.670> these<00:03:11.849> legal<00:03:12.209> cases<00:03:13.019> that

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
because it's in these legal cases that

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.550 
because it's in these legal cases that
very<00:03:13.680> very<00:03:14.189> precise<00:03:14.819> memory<00:03:15.480> often<00:03:15.780> matters

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
very very precise memory often matters

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.869 
very very precise memory often matters
and<00:03:16.950> so<00:03:17.639> for<00:03:17.879> example<00:03:18.440> one<00:03:19.440> type<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:20.010> situation

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
and so for example one type of situation

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:25.520 
and so for example one type of situation
is<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.720> kind<00:03:22.500> of<00:03:22.620> typical<00:03:23.599> armed<00:03:24.599> robbery<00:03:25.230> case

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
is a kind of typical armed robbery case

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.390 
is a kind of typical armed robbery case
or<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.069> rape<00:03:26.879> case<00:03:27.239> or<00:03:27.720> maybe<00:03:28.079> a<00:03:28.230> murder<00:03:28.590> where

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
or a rape case or maybe a murder where

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.990 
or a rape case or maybe a murder where
there<00:03:29.609> is<00:03:29.909> an<00:03:30.440> eyewitness<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:32.099> the<00:03:32.340> crime<00:03:32.639> that

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
there is an eyewitness to the crime that

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.280 
there is an eyewitness to the crime that
actually<00:03:33.629> happened<00:03:34.340> we<00:03:35.340> now<00:03:35.609> know<00:03:35.970> that<00:03:36.480> there

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.290 
actually happened we now know that there

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:40.009 
actually happened we now know that there
are<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.919> growing<00:03:38.669> number<00:03:38.940> of<00:03:39.419> wrongful

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
are a growing number of wrongful

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:43.189 
are a growing number of wrongful
convictions<00:03:40.949> in<00:03:41.310> these<00:03:41.730> types<00:03:42.180> of<00:03:42.389> cases<00:03:42.629> and

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:43.199 
convictions in these types of cases and

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:45.349 
convictions in these types of cases and
I'm<00:03:43.590> concerned<00:03:44.099> about<00:03:44.340> those<00:03:44.699> how<00:03:44.909> do<00:03:44.970> we<00:03:45.150> know

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:45.359 
I'm concerned about those how do we know

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:48.500
