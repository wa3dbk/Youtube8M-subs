00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 new graduates who have taken the path 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.810
 of the tfa to be able to access the 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.940
 rankings otherwise we don't have it 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.110
 said I told him that discriminating 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.030
 towards us 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.370
 sure she understood the situation has 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.960
 having said that it is very difficult because it is there 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.760
 really one that you had to do one 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.740
 cruise that is a casino to solve 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.109
 now the school situation will do 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.580
 said that it will read what we 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.349
 we wrote he listened to us 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.300
 patiently even in the morning in the 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.550
 questions about our situation 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.739
 we launched we told him 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.050
 above all, at least I have felt less 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.090
 personally but we also have them 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 insisted not to let this pass 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 message absolutely that we are 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:48.719
 b series teachers just because they don't 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.219
 we explained not his merano that 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.219
 there will be a comb insertion 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:08.850
 only gentlemen for the Italian school 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:19.920
 there is a need for teachers 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:21.479
 I thought it would shut down and the precarious things that you did 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.549
 we have emphasized this distinction 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.710
 of thirty blue she understood is in 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.450
 She goes quiet we actually saying 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.790
 new graduate with 30 points nomination 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:36.840
 because he had not understood that they are attested 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:41.840
 not only did we not get it wrong 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.840
 seen giving up many advisers 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:50.450
 then he had understood we had it 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.450
 stressed the same time is not that it is 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.860
 life has been resolved because yes no 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.650
 obviously he didn't give us any guarantees 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:16.700
 he did not say board was right 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:25.940
 that will change the problem this is the 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:28.610
 problem is that the direction from how you 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.560
 I have been saying about consortia for a long time and indeed 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.450
 that's why she next year for 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.190
 access contest because the ranking 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:40.100
 they have no exhaustion 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:43.610
 intend to reopen it in fouls and 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:46.160
 so the problem is this not from 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.959
 they will reopen, however, they plan to access 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.870
 also from the easy ones otherwise they would be 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:54.110
 cut off from role access 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.910
 through the contest this girls in 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.570
 We have understood the contest that we 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.310
 we must have important operate I do not 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.680
 I'm sure this situation of the 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.390
 quick score seemed to have already been received 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.690
 he listened to us said he reads 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.880
 what we gave him thinks about 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:14.390
 that the difficult situation that you 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.160
 indeed it is just the experts 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.160
 scheiber the situation of the school there 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:22.790
 he loves because he makes meetings in 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.489
 to which they sign a decree that looks at you 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.450
 you know how controversial I am and I am also 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.510
 state has provided 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.340
 maybe because in a couple of occasions we 

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:34.549
 abruptly interrupted, I spoke to her 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.870
 above but I must say that it was mind 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.030
 heard 

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.010
 I certainly didn't expect him to 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:43.459
 in front of four without unions at 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.920
 shoulders without voting power without power 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.260
 the bikes because we are not united because if 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.230
 no if you see the earth missing under the 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:55.250
 standing in the election someone listens to you 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:58.480
 but we are not 4 armed and go and 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:58.480
 so what we wanted most
