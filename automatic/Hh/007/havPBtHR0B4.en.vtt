 to go on but not download too much 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.300
 of sims either because it makes 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.250
 bugs in the game that installs you 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.070

 for clothes but that's exactly 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.670
 the same for shoe accessories by 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:50.200
 against there are not many accessories and 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.390
 not a lot of shoes that I 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.540
 could make ports on that but 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:57.760
 otherwise it's super nice so you 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.799

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:05.530
 clothes you click on the dress that 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:07.420
 you're interested and so you go 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.280
 are going to have the presentation rate of 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.989
 the dress smothers 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:16.479
 there will be models on sims in 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:19.630
 it's really super pretty so 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:23.410
 you're going all the way down to actually 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.720
 get on that so in fact it's saving 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:28.690
 honor because you can either 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.720
 download for young adults 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.820
 or adults or either download for 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.160
 than teens or for both so that's 

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:39.389
 cool so you can choose that too 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.389
 it's too cool too 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:46.060
 what you want to download if you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:48.099
 want to download a package in sims 3 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:49.510
 Pack, so in fact it will not be that 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.940
 it's like for the changes it's going 

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:53.080
 launch your game thrower if I get 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:56.349
 wrong because I never tried 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.599
 a sims 3 easter pals but I believe that 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.889
 that's it if I'm wrong it's okay 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:02.169
 start the ballot ball game and 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:05.349
 twittos so it's super good if you 

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:08.130
 lose one day your packages I speak in 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:08.130
 knowingly 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:14.130
 So that's me, that's what I recommend 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.400
 to do next if you want not free 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.020
 to you not to do it and we pack is 

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.210
 exactly the same as for the post 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.410
 player you will have to click on sims 3 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:29.700
 package dots you'll have a it's going you 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:34.860

 with a package going you will need 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.550
 of a rare so that's why if you 

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:08.070

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.480
