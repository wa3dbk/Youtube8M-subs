so fluid bit like any else you know that

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.030 
so fluid bit like any else you know that
rate<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.510> that<00:00:33.840> he's<00:00:33.960> had<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.320> since<00:00:34.920> he<00:00:35.010> was

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040

brilliant it doesn't Multan understand
anything<00:00:38.190> technically<00:00:38.760> once<00:00:39.390> rhythm<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.899> his

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
anything technically once rhythm and his

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.959 
anything technically once rhythm and his
golf<00:00:40.170> swing<00:00:40.469> that<00:00:40.500> as<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.860> said<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.219> him<00:00:41.309> all<00:00:41.579> the

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
golf swing that as I said to him all the

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.850 
golf swing that as I said to him all the
time<00:00:42.149> people<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.260> rhythm<00:00:43.559> you<00:00:43.680> need<00:00:43.829> a

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
time people to get rhythm you need a

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.860 
time people to get rhythm you need a
routine<00:00:44.340> routine<00:00:45.000> and<00:00:45.420> rhythm<00:00:45.719> are

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
routine routine and rhythm are

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.569 
routine routine and rhythm are
indivisible<00:00:46.230> linked<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.920> if<00:00:47.010> your<00:00:47.129> routine<00:00:47.460> is

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
indivisible linked so if your routine is

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.520 
indivisible linked so if your routine is
good<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:47.910> rhythm<00:00:48.149> gets<00:00:48.329> better<00:00:48.629> so<00:00:49.170> you<00:00:49.230> can't

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
good you rhythm gets better so you can't

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
good you rhythm gets better so you can't
just<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.039> what<00:00:50.579> I'd<00:00:50.700> like<00:00:50.850> to<00:00:51.000> find<00:00:51.239> rhythm<00:00:51.570> in

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
just do what I'd like to find rhythm in

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.360 
just do what I'd like to find rhythm in
midair<00:00:52.020> and<00:00:52.230> bring<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.890> into<00:00:53.039> my<00:00:53.129> swing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
midair and bring you into my swing

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.830 
midair and bring you into my swing
you've<00:00:53.550> got<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.760> get<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:53.969> routine<00:00:54.329> but<00:00:54.480> so

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
you've got to get the routine but so

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.000 
you've got to get the routine but so
you're<00:00:54.960> going<00:00:55.079> to<00:00:55.110> know<00:00:55.230> what<00:00:55.440> routine<00:00:55.890> is

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
you're going to know what routine is

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
you're going to know what routine is
going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.219> create<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.940> rhythm<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.809> it's

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
going to create the rhythm so it's

00:00:57.989 --> 00:00:59.779 
going to create the rhythm so it's
routine<00:00:58.289> rhythm<00:00:58.710> so<00:00:58.890> that's<00:00:59.340> really<00:00:59.550> all<00:00:59.760> he

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
routine rhythm so that's really all he

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.990 
routine rhythm so that's really all he
ever<00:00:59.910> works<00:01:00.210> on<00:01:00.449> very<00:01:00.870> laid-back<00:01:01.699> and<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:02.850> is

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
ever works on very laid-back and now is

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:14.560 
ever works on very laid-back and now is
with<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.210> golf<00:01:03.359> balls<00:01:03.660> is<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:04.080> lot<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.559> Louie

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:14.570 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.910 

you<00:01:15.570> gotta<00:01:15.750> remember<00:01:15.870> that<00:01:16.200> he's<00:01:16.290> hypermobile

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
you gotta remember that he's hypermobile

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.340 
you gotta remember that he's hypermobile
his<00:01:17.190> shoulders<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.940> that<00:01:18.090> was<00:01:18.300> one<00:01:18.570> area<00:01:18.990> that

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
his shoulders and that was one area that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.020 
his shoulders and that was one area that
you<00:01:19.800> know<00:01:19.920> certainly<00:01:20.310> we<00:01:20.430> have<00:01:20.550> to<00:01:20.580> sort<00:01:20.790> out

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you know certainly we have to sort out

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.750 
you know certainly we have to sort out
as<00:01:21.780> soon<00:01:22.020> as<00:01:22.140> that<00:01:22.290> hypermobility<00:01:23.010> comes<00:01:23.520> into

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
as soon as that hypermobility comes into

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.490 
as soon as that hypermobility comes into
his<00:01:23.820> shoulders<00:01:24.300> then<00:01:24.540> he<00:01:24.840> loses<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.229> bit<00:01:25.470> of

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
his shoulders then he loses a bit of

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.469 
his shoulders then he loses a bit of
control<00:01:25.800> in<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.159> change<00:01:26.400> of<00:01:26.520> direction<00:01:26.670> so

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
control in the change of direction so

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.000 
control in the change of direction so
the<00:01:27.600> more<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.869> can<00:01:27.900> tighten<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.560> control

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
the more you can tighten and control

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.080 
the more you can tighten and control
them<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.340> better<00:01:29.550> that's<00:01:29.820> always

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
them the better that's always

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.120 
them the better that's always
technically<00:01:30.720> expected<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.259> simple<00:01:31.920> as<00:01:32.009> that

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
technically expected so simple as that

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.390 
technically expected so simple as that
really<00:01:33.020> it's<00:01:34.020> got<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.200> lot<00:01:34.410> of<00:01:34.440> deceleration<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
really it's got a lot of deceleration in

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.340 
really it's got a lot of deceleration in
swing<00:01:35.700> which<00:01:36.180> creates<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.690> acceleration

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
swing which creates the acceleration

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:38.810 
swing which creates the acceleration
everybody<00:01:37.740> tries<00:01:37.950> to<00:01:38.100> swing<00:01:38.310> quicker<00:01:38.580> but

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
everybody tries to swing quicker but

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
everybody tries to swing quicker but
it's<00:01:39.300> the<00:01:39.420> deceleration<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.259> creates<00:01:40.619> the

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
it's the deceleration that creates the

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.280 
it's the deceleration that creates the
acceleration<00:01:41.430> that's<00:01:41.580> the<00:01:41.700> key<00:01:41.909> Loic<00:01:42.690> as<00:01:43.080> long

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
acceleration that's the key Loic as long

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.719 
acceleration that's the key Loic as long
as<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.470> tighten<00:01:43.650> the<00:01:43.860> shoulders<00:01:44.310> up<00:01:44.430> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
as you tighten the shoulders up the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.930 
as you tighten the shoulders up the
whole<00:01:44.940> position<00:01:45.320> it<00:01:46.320> can<00:01:46.530> do<00:01:46.619> anything<00:01:46.940> as

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:47.940 
whole position it can do anything as

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.820 
whole position it can do anything as
well<00:01:48.210> as<00:01:48.330> Louis<00:01:48.690> Cowan<00:01:49.170> has<00:01:49.289> also<00:01:49.470> enjoyed
