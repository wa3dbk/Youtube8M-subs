classic kitchen design so when only for
that<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.199> either<00:00:58.739> white<00:00:59.250> wall<00:00:59.430> or<00:00:59.609> a<00:00:59.670> block<00:01:00.120> of

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that is either white wall or a block of

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.020 
that is either white wall or a block of
iron<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.780> some<00:01:01.260> black<00:01:01.530> wool<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.100> use<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.789> block

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
iron and some black wool I use a block

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.789 
iron and some black wool I use a block
of<00:01:03.180> iron<00:01:03.270> just<00:01:03.539> because<00:01:03.719> it<00:01:03.840> looks<00:01:03.870> nicer<00:01:04.769> I

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
of iron just because it looks nicer I

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:06.859 
of iron just because it looks nicer I
didn't<00:01:05.159> have<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.489> wall<00:01:06.270> texture<00:01:06.720> in<00:01:06.810> the

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
didn't have the wall texture in the

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.149 
didn't have the wall texture in the
block<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:07.350> dark<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:07.890> see<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
block is so dark you don't see the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.609 
block is so dark you don't see the
texture<00:01:08.490> so<00:01:08.760> that's<00:01:09.540> why<00:01:09.780> I<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.350> still<00:01:10.500> use

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
texture so that's why I can still use

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.020 
texture so that's why I can still use
that<00:01:10.680> so<00:01:11.340> I'm<00:01:11.850> just<00:01:12.000> going<00:01:12.119> to<00:01:12.180> take<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.510> off

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
that so I'm just going to take this off

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.679

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
and two iron blocks I think I covered it

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.100 
and two iron blocks I think I covered it
all<00:02:56.250> if<00:02:56.550> I<00:02:56.760> did<00:02:57.000> you<00:02:57.180> will<00:02:57.330> see<00:02:57.540> as<00:02:57.720> I<00:02:57.870> build

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
all if I did you will see as I build

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.610 
all if I did you will see as I build
what<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.440> use<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.630> so<00:03:00.630> I'm<00:03:00.780> just<00:03:00.989> doing<00:03:01.230> it<00:03:01.320> like

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
what I use to so I'm just doing it like

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.320 
what I use to so I'm just doing it like
this<00:03:03.200> that's<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.530> be<00:03:04.560> my<00:03:04.739> kitchen<00:03:05.330> and

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
this that's going to be my kitchen and

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.780 
this that's going to be my kitchen and
so<00:03:07.110> this<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.470> my<00:03:07.590> basic<00:03:07.830> counter<00:03:08.220> now<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.610> you

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
so this is my basic counter now if you

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.460 
so this is my basic counter now if you
really<00:03:09.060> want<00:03:09.239> you<00:03:09.450> can<00:03:09.600> add<00:03:09.630> like<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:10.080> slab<00:03:10.440> on

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
really want you can add like a slab on

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.070 
really want you can add like a slab on
top<00:03:10.920> but<00:03:11.670> I<00:03:11.880> think<00:03:12.120> it<00:03:12.209> messes<00:03:12.540> up<00:03:12.570> and<00:03:12.870> makes

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
top but I think it messes up and makes

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.890 
top but I think it messes up and makes
it<00:03:13.200> a<00:03:13.260> little<00:03:13.410> too<00:03:13.590> high<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:14.070> I<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.340> left<00:03:14.610> it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it a little too high so I just left it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.290 
it a little too high so I just left it
so<00:03:15.900> now<00:03:16.170> we're<00:03:16.709> going<00:03:16.800> to<00:03:16.860> go<00:03:16.950> on<00:03:17.160> to<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
so now we're going to go on to is the

can play stuff now for this design
because<00:04:12.240> my<00:04:12.569> house<00:04:12.750> isn't<00:04:13.050> very<00:04:13.440> wide<00:04:13.620> usually

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
because my house isn't very wide usually

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.640 
because my house isn't very wide usually
I<00:04:14.190> would<00:04:14.340> put<00:04:14.670> a<00:04:14.880> two<00:04:15.510> there<00:04:15.720> and<00:04:15.900> then<00:04:16.049> my<00:04:16.260> car

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
I would put a two there and then my car

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.159 
I would put a two there and then my car
be<00:04:16.859> like<00:04:17.370> it<00:04:17.549> had<00:04:17.730> to<00:04:17.970> and<00:04:18.239> then<00:04:18.810> I'd<00:04:18.930> be<00:04:18.989> that

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
be like it had to and then I'd be that

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:21.319 
be like it had to and then I'd be that
but<00:04:19.500> I<00:04:19.530> can't<00:04:19.799> do<00:04:19.950> that<00:04:19.980> all<00:04:20.250> here<00:04:20.519> there

00:04:21.319 --> 00:04:21.329 
but I can't do that all here there

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:22.610 
but I can't do that all here there
should<00:04:21.450> be<00:04:21.480> two<00:04:21.660> more<00:04:21.810> wide<00:04:22.019> so<00:04:22.380> I'm<00:04:22.470> just

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
should be two more wide so I'm just

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.830 
should be two more wide so I'm just
going<00:04:22.740> to<00:04:22.800> stick<00:04:23.010> one<00:04:23.270> if<00:04:24.270> you<00:04:24.389> want<00:04:24.570> to<00:04:24.630> do<00:04:24.690> to

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
going to stick one if you want to do to

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.490 
going to stick one if you want to do to
you<00:04:24.870> can<00:04:25.230> I'm<00:04:26.040> sure<00:04:26.790> I'll<00:04:27.090> have<00:04:27.389> a<00:04:27.450> tour<00:04:27.750> or<00:04:28.080> if

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
you can I'm sure I'll have a tour or if

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.830 
you can I'm sure I'll have a tour or if
I<00:04:28.590> already<00:04:28.710> do<00:04:28.919> have<00:04:29.370> one<00:04:29.580> up<00:04:29.700> of<00:04:29.880> my<00:04:30.210> castle<00:04:30.450> on

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
I already do have one up of my castle on

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.750 
I already do have one up of my castle on
our<00:04:31.260> server<00:04:31.500> and<00:04:31.800> I<00:04:31.890> i'll<00:04:32.280> show<00:04:32.580> you<00:04:32.669> the

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
our server and I i'll show you the

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.550 
our server and I i'll show you the
kitchen<00:04:32.880> in<00:04:33.180> there<00:04:33.360> and<00:04:33.510> it<00:04:33.600> has<00:04:33.750> two<00:04:34.110> chests

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:34.560 
kitchen in there and it has two chests

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:36.890 
kitchen in there and it has two chests
but<00:04:35.280> series<00:04:35.880> can<00:04:36.000> take<00:04:36.150> the<00:04:36.240> chest<00:04:36.480> and<00:04:36.720> put

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
but series can take the chest and put

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:38.600 
but series can take the chest and put
them<00:04:36.990> up<00:04:37.140> there<00:04:37.169> now<00:04:37.800> it<00:04:37.890> doesn't<00:04:38.160> quite<00:04:38.310> match

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
them up there now it doesn't quite match

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.730 
them up there now it doesn't quite match
