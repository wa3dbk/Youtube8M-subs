exciting<00:03:03.900> we've<00:03:04.900> got<00:03:05.019> three<00:03:05.230> concepts<00:03:05.709> that

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
exciting we've got three concepts that

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:07.770 
exciting we've got three concepts that
we've<00:03:05.980> got<00:03:06.130> today<00:03:06.400> so<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:07.209> standard<00:03:07.569> product

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
we've got today so the standard product

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.330 
we've got today so the standard product
that<00:03:08.019> we've<00:03:08.110> always<00:03:08.260> had<00:03:08.440> is<00:03:08.620> called<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:08.890> 48

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
that we've always had is called the 48

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.850 
that we've always had is called the 48
mil<00:03:09.579> which<00:03:10.030> is<00:03:10.209> why<00:03:10.329> we've<00:03:10.540> got<00:03:10.720> the<00:03:10.870> big<00:03:11.440> 48

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
mil which is why we've got the big 48

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.940 
mil which is why we've got the big 48
graphic<00:03:12.250> above<00:03:12.569> this<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.780> the<00:03:14.019> 88<00:03:14.739> mil<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:16.950> on

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
graphic above this is the 88 mil so on

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:20.069 
graphic above this is the 88 mil so on
the<00:03:18.040> market<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> 44<00:03:19.000> male<00:03:19.239> thick<00:03:19.510> so<00:03:19.750> this<00:03:19.900> is<00:03:20.049> a

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:20.079 
the market a 44 male thick so this is a

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:22.650 
the market a 44 male thick so this is a
62<00:03:20.530> mil<00:03:20.889> door<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.430> it's<00:03:21.970> a<00:03:22.090> lot<00:03:22.209> thicker<00:03:22.450> and

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:22.660 
62 mil door so it's a lot thicker and

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.620 
62 mil door so it's a lot thicker and
stronger<00:03:22.900> than<00:03:23.200> everybody<00:03:23.380> else's<00:03:24.480> why<00:03:25.480> does

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:25.630 
stronger than everybody else's why does

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:26.879 
stronger than everybody else's why does
it<00:03:25.720> need<00:03:25.840> to<00:03:25.870> be<00:03:25.959> so<00:03:26.079> thick<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.590> mean<00:03:26.709> it's<00:03:26.799> not

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:26.889 
it need to be so thick I mean it's not

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.280 
it need to be so thick I mean it's not
gonna<00:03:27.100> withstand<00:03:27.549> like<00:03:28.120> on<00:03:28.389> them<00:03:28.750> all<00:03:29.019> manner

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
gonna withstand like on them all manner

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.930 
gonna withstand like on them all manner
of<00:03:29.410> elements<00:03:29.950> yeah<00:03:30.100> it's<00:03:30.280> much<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.609> secure

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
of elements yeah it's much more secure

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.550 
of elements yeah it's much more secure
but<00:03:31.180> also<00:03:31.269> it's<00:03:31.600> better<00:03:31.780> thermally<00:03:32.260> as<00:03:32.350> well

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
but also it's better thermally as well

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.650 
but also it's better thermally as well
so<00:03:32.859> it's<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.700> most<00:03:33.850> secure<00:03:34.239> door<00:03:34.480> on<00:03:34.569> the

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
so it's the most secure door on the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:36.420 
so it's the most secure door on the
market<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.230> lot<00:03:35.530> of<00:03:35.590> the<00:03:35.709> foam<00:03:35.889> doors<00:03:36.160> you<00:03:36.340> can

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
market a lot of the foam doors you can

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.979 
market a lot of the foam doors you can
actually<00:03:36.579> cut<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.150> few<00:03:37.359> attack<00:03:37.569> them<00:03:37.750> you<00:03:37.780> can't

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
actually cut a few attack them you can't

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.780 
actually cut a few attack them you can't
actually<00:03:38.290> break<00:03:38.470> through<00:03:38.709> them<00:03:38.920> so<00:03:39.430> with<00:03:39.639> our

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
actually break through them so with our
