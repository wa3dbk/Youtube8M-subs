00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:03.400
 Hello

 let's see how to make a 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.820
 makeup in five minutes with easy gestures 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.489
 and I apply bb as a basis 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.039
 cream plus primer a product 

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:34.309
 wonderful because it joins the 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.640
 benefits of the primer with the skin effect 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.290
 naked bb cream thanks to the effect 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.650
 of the trainer the skin appears 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:46.010
 immediately smooth uniform and without 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:48.590
 imperfections and thanks instead benefits 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.719
 of the bb cream and let's remove it 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:53.960
 all the little skin discolouration 

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:56.930
 leaving a hydrated luminous complexion 

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:58.640
 and supernatural and we apply it on everything 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.879
 the face as if it were a cream 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.460
 moisturizing avoiding the eye area 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.679
 art can be used alone or before 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.250
 of the foundation to create a base 

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:12.500
 perfect you live before it really is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.479
 easy to apply and is perfect for 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.450
 all those women who want one 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.179
 hydrated and fresh-looking skin 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.009
 super bright 

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:25.039
 let's correct the gray areas of the 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:27.140
 face and dark circles with luminys touch that is 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.479
 perfect just because it also leaves 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.140
 this is a superluminova and fresh look 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.149
 to the skin 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.819
 obviously where we have some 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.130
 most obvious imperfections we will use or 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:40.509
 the speak cannes filler or the magik indeed 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.509
 leur that are more covering 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.200
 if you have normal dry skin 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:51.940
 you can leave the brini rino bbk 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.460
 with luminist that is without the application 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 of the powder instead if you have a skin 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.510
 from mixed to fat I recommend 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.619
 apply above a figure to test the 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.850
 product and have an effect 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.850
 completely mans 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.030
 now they warm up incarnate and I go to sculpt 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.640
 the face with the android stauder force 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.609
 thanks to its four colors we can 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.780
 in a simple way to go to 

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:28.079
 emphasize facial volumes we mix 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.090
 the lightest colors and let's go to 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:32.819
 apply them as circular motions on 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.799
 the whole face we use the darkest 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:39.500
 under the cheekbones in the contour of the face 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.500
 to sculpt the volumes of the face 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:52.880
 after creating the leather effect base 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.400
 naked we go to see how to make up the 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.650
 eyes 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.230
 I'm going to create the light points with candles 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:04.010
 silp number 100 a white with an effect 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:06.740
 I apply it starting from the corner 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:09.290
 of the arched eyebrows and faded it 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:14.120
 along the arch for a natural effect e 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.910
 I also apply it internally 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:19.510
 of the eye near the lacrimal duct 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.510
 to give freshness 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:26.510
 now I'm going to apply a golden brown 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.120
 always with a satin effect starting 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:31.610
 from the base of the eyelashes and doha of course 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.490
 the whole eyelid the color must 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:37.700
 be very sacred near the base of the 

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:40.400
 eyelashes then we go to blend it in 

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:42.820
 fixed eyelid moving eyelid creating 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:42.820
 a semicircle 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:56.500
 now I'm going to blur my shade 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.480
 with the brush for ample shades mi 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.850
 it may help to mix the two 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.010
 colors to get an intermediate color 

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.520
 and thus make the shade a lot 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.520
 natural 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.780
 arctic on the eyelashes mascara goes 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:27.280

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:30.160
 a touch of color and have super lips 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.380
 Brilliant is a really easy lipstick 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.340
 to be applied and does not require 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:35.340
 lip contour pencil 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.550

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:42.900

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.900
