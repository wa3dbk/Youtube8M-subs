00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 which foods to feed us really well 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:09.000
 written by fausto carotenuto 6 March 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.509
 2013 the beings present on ours 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.179
 beautiful planet are of many types 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 mineral plants, animals and humans 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.609
 then there are many others on others 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.890
 plans and dimensions that we do not see but 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.080
 they are intensely industrious on plans 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.490
 invisible like that of life e 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.949
 the psychic one 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.080
 the first ancient traditions of profound 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.899
 they call it etheric and the wisdom 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.850
 second astral every being on earth 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.129
 to a different degree of evolution e 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.860
 this corresponds to increasing degrees of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.110
 creativity the extra human beings 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.030
 compared to the others they have evolved up 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 to produce something unique 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 thoughts thoughts just so you thought 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.520
 that we produced commodities art goods of each 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.010
 type etc. 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.370
 what do thoughts actually have to do with us 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.770
 we produce all these material things 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:04.680
 also sophisticated precisely because before 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.170
 we thought about it because they are the result of 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.180
 thoughts and other visible beings 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.400
 on earth have not yet arrived at 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.430
 be able to create this particular genre 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.490
 product is true that even animals 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.890
 plants and even minerals produce 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:22.830
 effects and very clever things ed 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.650
 extremely wise but do it by following 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.900
 of the laws of guides such as instinct 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.600
 that they come from outside that they are not 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.280
 fruit of their elaboration 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.439
 wise would be right to say that 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.110
 they come from their spiritual guides 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.650
 the guides of the various groups of beings i 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:43.290
 thoughts instead us as human beings there 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.079
 we use improper and for millennia we are 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.930
 elaborating in various ways wrong in 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:51.299
 many cases and correcting errors 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.610
 the main mistake is better to say 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.560
 experience that we have done so far 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.210
 is that this ability to use i 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.750
 thoughts we have made available 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.460
 above all of our impulses 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.280
 materials and this has generated one 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.200
 predatory and selfish society with damage 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.319
 huge for human society and for 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.840
 the ecosystem 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.389
 but now there is a few decades ago 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.219
 beautiful new age of development 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.739
 of conscience wants to introduce a 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.780
 new element in thoughts love 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.269
 unconditional for others and for the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.150
 earth and its beings this need 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.459
 is pressing inside us and will lead to 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.250
 produce more and better thoughts 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:33.069
 creative for the good of all beings 

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:35.500
 of our fantastic planet we say 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:38.139
 so that the thoughts that work for 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.659
 the good of all are those thought with 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:42.969
 heart all our structure too 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:46.060
 physics is made to produce 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:48.819
 thoughts and thoughts full of love that 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.250
 produce actions that are good for us and 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:53.680
 all that is around us but for 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.500
 work well we need to have 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.810
 the right and necessary forces for this 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.780
 delicate and important activity i 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.969
 thoughts circulate in the cosmos in the world 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:06.459
 of ideas of which he speaks so well or 

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:08.799
 platone but to catch them and make them ours 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.199
 and to produce our lively ed 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.989
 some elements are effective 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:16.449
 also important on the material level i 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.509
 thoughts when they circulate within us 

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:22.389
 they are made of a vital material that is 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:24.040
 also called etheric which is the energy which 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.739
 flows within us 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.439
 expression of divine love if this 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.729
 energy decreases we get sick if it comes out 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.949
 life ends 

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:35.109
 one of the effects of the decrease of 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:37.870
 this energy is less divine love 

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:40.750
 it flows within us and that our thoughts are 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:43.209
 weaken we think sloppy thoughts 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:46.299
 and not very creative and not free at all 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.579
 lively and also the body in deficit of 

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.680
 vitality love gets sick 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:53.769
 but where we take this matter from 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.629
 and for the acs or vital from the cosmos through 

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.909
 the vitality present everywhere 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.020
 what the ancient Indian sages 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:02.110
 they called landslide 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:04.300
 and then from the food every day we say 

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.970
 so that the food in addition to feeding the 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.640
 physical body has the specific task of 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:12.310
 give strength and vitality to thoughts 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:14.470
 of course provided that it is also the 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.500
 It is full of food and material for AC or 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:19.810
 vital another thing we carry inside 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.540
 of us with food are ideas and 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.070
 of the thought forms they have to 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:25.840
 deal with the way the world 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:28.540
 spiritual or human have 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.080
 designed created or produced that type 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.660
 of food 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:33.940
 the spiritual world in designing a 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.520
 fruit has given us enormous wisdom 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.890
 constructive and a great love not 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.140
 I did it for myself but for the creatures 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.890
 of the earth to support them in theirs 

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.530
 growth 

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.930
 therefore the food is also the bearer of one 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:49.390
 subtle matter made of great ideas e 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:51.550
 great love when we eat 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:54.400
 in addition to ingesting useful elements to 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:56.620
 we also feed on our physical body 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.410
 vitality for our thoughts of 

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:01.300
 thoughts of wines and of course love 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.360
 this happens only if the products 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:06.490
 what we eat were not 

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:08.890
 devitalized altered conditioned 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:11.590
 before bringing them to our table 

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:13.690
 and if they correspond to the loving project 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:16.300
 divine to give us a nourishment of love 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.360
 for the body the vitality and soul of 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:22.150
 give us our right bread every day 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.390
 daily of divine origin but then 

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:25.870
 you will say why much 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:28.570
 of agriculture and industry 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:31.590
 food world do everything to 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:34.750
 give us your own cd turned off 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.440
 conditional initiated deprived of life and 

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.810
 love 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.090
 because of lack of love because 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.250
 certain dark forces worldwide 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.440
 they want to stop the growth of 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.810
 human consciousness based on 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.240
 freedom to think thoughts the wise and 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.310
 full of love and turning them into actions 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:53.470
 such as to improve the world and society 

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.870
 human and why the lack of 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.630
 selfish awareness and strengths e 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:06:01.180
 predatory and still present in us though 

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.280
 to gain more selfishly yes 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.980
 they lend themselves to the great game of forces 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.229
 obscure anti-conscience and then give up 

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:09.950
 for money to the seduction of chemistry 

00:06:08.229 --> 00:06:12.710
 of GMOs 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:15.590
 of the additives of the dyes 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.690
 radiation of the facility to preserve e 

00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:20.720
 prepare certain foods of laziness 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:23.240
 of the hurry and in these cd not only 

00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:26.150
 life is lacking the strength of thoughts 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:28.460
 divine love but their positivity for 

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.260
 us and is further diminished by the 

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:33.140
 fact that the production chain e 

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:35.750
 distributive works without love indeed to the 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.570
 otherwise it works to prey and come 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.060
 out foods that are also deformed and 

00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.730
 weakened by the lack of human love 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:46.430
 these foods weaken and sicken the 

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:48.740
 our physical body reduces ours 

00:06:46.430 --> 00:06:51.050
 vitality and extinguish our forces of 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.390
 thought and love make us less 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.910
 free and more easily controlled by 

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:58.130
 those dark world powers that are 

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.620
 take over not only finance and 

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:03.560
 governments but also large chains 

00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:05.720
 of production and distribution of food e 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:07.940
 then which foods to choose for us 

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:10.940
 and for the people around us 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:13.400
 carefully chosen organic foods not 

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.310
 altered in their original design 

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:19.160
 foods full of life foods you don't 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:21.190
 vital forces have been removed but 

00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:24.050
 increased with cultivation processes 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:26.180
 production processing e 

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:28.910
 distribution inspired by amorosa 

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:31.160
 awareness the more we will consume only 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:32.870
 these foods will also oblige us more 

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:35.900
 production and distribution chains 

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.540
 to supply us we will give strength to ours 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:40.550
 individual and social freedoms and ne 

00:07:38.540 --> 00:07:43.460
 we will take away the powers they want 

00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:45.410
 enslaving someone will say that eating 

00:07:43.460 --> 00:07:47.780
 bio costs more and not everyone if it 

00:07:45.410 --> 00:07:50.450
 they can afford not really so 

00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:52.640
 we can eat bio by choosing to 

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:53.450
 spend less on other things less 

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.780
 important 

00:07:53.450 --> 00:07:58.790
 we can also reduce the quantities 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:01.070
 sometimes excessive the conscience will find 

00:07:58.790 --> 00:08:03.620
 the ways you care about your health 

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:05.800
 and to their own freedom and then more 

00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:08.330
 we will buy organic plus prices will fall 

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:10.490
 we choose the cd to feed well the 

00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:13.810
 our body and our consciousness 

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:13.810
 we can do it
