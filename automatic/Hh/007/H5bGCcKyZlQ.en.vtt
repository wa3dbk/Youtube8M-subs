out the other tape to make it look like
this<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> what<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:17.790> did<00:01:17.970> was<00:01:18.119> I<00:01:18.210> just<00:01:18.270> cut<00:01:18.570> out

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
this so I what I did was I just cut out

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.270 
this so I what I did was I just cut out
the<00:01:18.780> image<00:01:18.900> and<00:01:19.350> I'm<00:01:19.799> just<00:01:19.950> switching<00:01:20.250> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
colors and that's kind of the easiest

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.240 
colors and that's kind of the easiest
way<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.630> get<00:01:21.869> around<00:01:22.110> that<00:01:22.350> disadvantage

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
way to get around that disadvantage

there's not gonna be too much layering
on<00:01:30.750> it<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.110> of<00:01:31.740> course<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.100> biggest<00:01:32.310> issue

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
on it and of course the biggest issue

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.429 
on it and of course the biggest issue
when<00:01:32.970> you're<00:01:33.060> working<00:01:33.390> on<00:01:33.479> puzzle<00:01:33.869> decoration

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
when you're working on puzzle decoration

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:35.929 
when you're working on puzzle decoration
is<00:01:34.530> making<00:01:34.890> sure<00:01:35.040> all<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.400> pieces<00:01:35.579> fit

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
is making sure all the pieces fit

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.390 
is making sure all the pieces fit
together<00:01:36.350> without<00:01:37.350> there<00:01:37.530> being<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
together without there being the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.609 
together without there being the
background<00:01:38.909> color<00:01:39.390> shot<00:01:39.780> by<00:01:39.930> shining<00:01:40.200> through

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
background color shot by shining through

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
background color shot by shining through
which<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.040> kind<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.340> one<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:41.700> issues<00:01:42.150> that

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
which is kind of one of the issues that

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.880 
which is kind of one of the issues that
you<00:01:42.420> typically<00:01:42.899> face<00:01:43.290> with<00:01:43.560> puzzle

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
you typically face with puzzle

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
you typically face with puzzle
decoration<00:01:44.430> if<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.299> don't<00:01:45.450> cut<00:01:45.600> it<00:01:45.630> exactly

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
decoration if you don't cut it exactly

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.399 
decoration if you don't cut it exactly
the<00:01:46.710> same<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.369> exactly<00:01:47.579> perfectly<00:01:48.450> it's<00:01:49.140> not

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
the same or exactly perfectly it's not

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.429 
the same or exactly perfectly it's not
going<00:01:49.799> to<00:01:50.090> cover<00:01:51.090> up<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:52.049> hole<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.380> you

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
going to cover up the the hole that you

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:54.350 
going to cover up the the hole that you
have<00:01:52.770> very<00:01:53.310> well<00:01:53.549> so<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:53.909> kind<00:01:54.149> of<00:01:54.210> have<00:01:54.329> to

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
have very well so you kind of have to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.539 
have very well so you kind of have to
either<00:01:55.140> cut<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.530> area<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.219> little<00:01:56.369> bit

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
either cut the the area a little bit

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.190 
either cut the the area a little bit
bigger<00:01:56.759> so<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.329> kind<00:01:57.509> of<00:01:57.540> fits<00:01:57.750> into<00:01:57.990> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
bigger so that it kind of fits into the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.200 
bigger so that it kind of fits into the
image<00:01:58.500> well<00:01:58.710> otherwise<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.790> just<00:01:59.850> not<00:02:00.000> gonna

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
image well otherwise it's just not gonna

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.469 
image well otherwise it's just not gonna
work

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
work

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.780 
work
I<00:02:00.750> think<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.140> have<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> maneuver<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.340> little<00:02:02.670> bit

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
I think I have to maneuver a little bit

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.130 
I think I have to maneuver a little bit
just<00:02:02.939> to<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.149> sure<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.509> it<00:02:03.659> covers<00:02:03.869> up<00:02:04.079> the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
just to make sure that it covers up the

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.730 
just to make sure that it covers up the
entire<00:02:04.500> area<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.030> working<00:02:06.869> on<00:02:07.049> the<00:02:07.259> part<00:02:07.560> of

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
entire area so working on the part of

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.949 
entire area so working on the part of
his<00:02:08.069> body<00:02:08.250> next<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.910> course<00:02:09.119> this<00:02:09.209> of<00:02:09.360> course

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
his body next of course this of course

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.119 
his body next of course this of course
this<00:02:10.200> would<00:02:10.379> normally<00:02:10.679> be<00:02:10.800> the<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:10.979> know<00:02:11.039> the

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
this would normally be the you know the

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:12.680 
this would normally be the you know the
blue<00:02:11.370> tape<00:02:11.610> but<00:02:11.849> working<00:02:12.060> on<00:02:12.270> the<00:02:12.450> goal

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
blue tape but working on the goal

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.930 
blue tape but working on the goal
of<00:02:12.810> course<00:02:13.080> and<00:02:13.860> we're<00:02:14.250> specifically<00:02:14.700> at<00:02:14.850> the

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:14.940 
of course and we're specifically at the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.940 
of course and we're specifically at the
yellow<00:02:15.150> for<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.600> I'm<00:02:16.440> just<00:02:16.680> gonna<00:02:16.830> stick

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
yellow for this I'm just gonna stick

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.470 
yellow for this I'm just gonna stick
these<00:02:17.070> pieces<00:02:17.340> down<00:02:17.640> I'm<00:02:17.910> not<00:02:18.030> exactly<00:02:18.300> sure

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
these pieces down I'm not exactly sure

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.730 
these pieces down I'm not exactly sure
if<00:02:18.600> they're<00:02:18.810> going<00:02:18.960> to<00:02:19.140> end<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.440> there<00:02:19.620> they

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
if they're going to end up there they

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.560 
if they're going to end up there they
probably<00:02:19.950> aren't<00:02:20.400> and<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> could<00:02:21.270> say<00:02:21.420> that

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
probably aren't and I could say that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:22.670 
probably aren't and I could say that
they<00:02:21.690> guarantee<00:02:22.140> you<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.260> they<00:02:22.500> aren't

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
they guarantee you that they aren't

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.170 
they guarantee you that they aren't
going<00:02:22.860> to<00:02:23.130> because<00:02:23.400> I<00:02:23.430> move<00:02:23.730> them<00:02:23.880> later<00:02:24.060> on

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
going to because I move them later on

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.030 
going to because I move them later on
but<00:02:24.870> this<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.200> just<00:02:25.350> to<00:02:25.470> give<00:02:25.590> me<00:02:25.680> an<00:02:25.740> idea<00:02:25.800> of

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
but this is just to give me an idea of

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:28.310 
but this is just to give me an idea of
what<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.310> entire<00:02:26.520> image<00:02:26.790> looks<00:02:27.120> like<00:02:27.320> really

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
what the entire image looks like really

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.050 
what the entire image looks like really
be<00:02:28.530> all<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.920> images<00:02:29.280> that<00:02:29.310> are<00:02:29.610> going<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:29.910> be

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
be all the images that are going to be

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.720 
be all the images that are going to be
fit<00:02:30.570> into<00:02:30.780> that<00:02:31.050> piece<00:02:31.440> are<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.490> of<00:02:32.550> kind<00:02:32.700> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
fit into that piece are kind of kind of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.460 
fit into that piece are kind of kind of
gonna<00:02:33.090> be<00:02:33.210> my<00:02:33.330> guidelines<00:02:33.900> on<00:02:34.110> where<00:02:34.320> to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
gonna be my guidelines on where to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.700 
gonna be my guidelines on where to
eventually<00:02:35.010> put<00:02:35.220> those<00:02:35.340> yellow<00:02:35.700> pieces<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:37.350> um

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
eventually put those yellow pieces so um

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.680 
eventually put those yellow pieces so um
my<00:02:38.340> printer<00:02:38.640> didn't<00:02:38.880> do<00:02:38.940> an<00:02:39.060> exactly<00:02:39.480> very

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
my printer didn't do an exactly very

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.450 
my printer didn't do an exactly very
good<00:02:39.960> job<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.530> this<00:02:40.800> so<00:02:40.950> I<00:02:41.010> kind<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.310> had<00:02:41.430> to

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
good job on this so I kind of had to

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:45.080 
good job on this so I kind of had to
take<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.700> pen<00:02:42.030> in<00:02:42.240> kind<00:02:42.510> of<00:02:43.250> kind<00:02:44.250> of<00:02:44.310> freehand

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
take a pen in kind of kind of freehand

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.880 
take a pen in kind of kind of freehand
exactly<00:02:45.630> where<00:02:45.780> all<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.960> other<00:02:46.170> pieces<00:02:46.470> were

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
exactly where all the other pieces were

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.160 
exactly where all the other pieces were
I<00:02:47.190> think<00:02:47.640> put<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.880> little<00:02:48.120> X<00:02:48.420> where<00:02:48.750> the<00:02:48.900> pieces

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
I think put a little X where the pieces

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.990 
I think put a little X where the pieces
that<00:02:49.410> need<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.800> be<00:02:49.980> with<00:02:50.490> the<00:02:50.580> background

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
that need to be with the background

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.960 
that need to be with the background
color<00:02:51.300> kind<00:02:51.600> of<00:02:51.690> shining<00:02:52.020> through<00:02:52.970> definitely

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
color kind of shining through definitely

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.250 
color kind of shining through definitely
didn't<00:02:54.120> do<00:02:54.240> didn't<00:02:54.600> do<00:02:54.660> a<00:02:54.690> very<00:02:54.810> good<00:02:54.930> job<00:02:55.050> of

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
didn't do didn't do a very good job of

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.440 
didn't do didn't do a very good job of
cutting<00:02:55.470> out<00:02:55.740> all<00:02:55.770> those<00:02:56.220> or<00:02:56.820> printing<00:02:57.270> out

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
cutting out all those or printing out

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.690 
cutting out all those or printing out
all<00:02:57.480> those<00:02:57.810> little<00:02:58.110> lines<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.650> everything<00:02:59.070> so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700 
all those little lines and everything so

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.740 
all those little lines and everything so
you<00:02:59.820> can<00:02:59.910> kind<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.150> see<00:03:00.270> there's<00:03:00.450> a<00:03:00.510> lot<00:03:00.630> of

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
you can kind of see there's a lot of

within the next few days I do get a lot

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:32.450 
within the next few days I do get a lot
of<00:04:30.659> questions<00:04:31.050> on<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.830> know<00:04:31.919> how<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.099> cut<00:04:32.340> the

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
of questions on you know how to cut the

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.070 
of questions on you know how to cut the
tape<00:04:32.669> really<00:04:33.090> well<00:04:33.270> and<00:04:33.449> then<00:04:33.539> also<00:04:33.780> how<00:04:34.020> to

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080 
tape really well and then also how to

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.719 
tape really well and then also how to
use<00:04:34.259> the<00:04:34.409> packaging<00:04:34.919> tape<00:04:35.099> so<00:04:35.370> there<00:04:35.580> should

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
use the packaging tape so there should

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.850 
use the packaging tape so there should
be<00:04:35.789> two<00:04:35.940> videos<00:04:36.090> for<00:04:36.960> each<00:04:37.169> of<00:04:37.349> those<00:04:37.470> two

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:37.860 
be two videos for each of those two

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.830 
be two videos for each of those two

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:45.810 
to do with cutting tape and using

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:47.930 
to do with cutting tape and using
packaging<00:04:46.259> tape<00:04:46.460> it's<00:04:47.460> going<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.639> be<00:04:47.699> really

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
packaging tape it's going to be really

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:49.730 
packaging tape it's going to be really
interesting<00:04:48.360> as<00:04:48.750> you<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.050> tell<00:04:49.259> I<00:04:49.289> definitely

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
interesting as you can tell I definitely

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.260 
interesting as you can tell I definitely
use<00:04:49.830> a<00:04:49.860> lot<00:04:50.099> of<00:04:50.220> packaging<00:04:50.639> tape<00:04:50.789> my<00:04:51.060> time

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
use a lot of packaging tape my time

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.360 
use a lot of packaging tape my time
lapses<00:04:51.810> it's<00:04:51.990> definitely<00:04:52.530> one<00:04:52.800> of<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.069> the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
lapses it's definitely one of the the

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.369 
lapses it's definitely one of the the
lifesavers<00:04:54.030> when<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.240> comes<00:04:54.449> to<00:04:54.720> using<00:04:54.960> duct

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:55.379 
lifesavers when it comes to using duct

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:57.230 
lifesavers when it comes to using duct
tape<00:04:55.470> and<00:04:55.800> cutting<00:04:56.370> things<00:04:56.550> out<00:04:56.789> of<00:04:57.000> different

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
tape and cutting things out of different

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.040 
tape and cutting things out of different
paper<00:04:58.169> templates<00:04:58.680> like<00:04:58.800> this<00:04:59.099> and<00:04:59.690> I<00:05:00.690> remember

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:01.050 
paper templates like this and I remember

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.290 
paper templates like this and I remember
way<00:05:01.620> back<00:05:01.650> in<00:05:01.979> the<00:05:02.039> day<00:05:02.190> long<00:05:02.759> before<00:05:03.000> I<00:05:03.060> used

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:03.300 
way back in the day long before I used

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.540 
way back in the day long before I used
the<00:05:03.479> packaging<00:05:03.900> tape<00:05:04.020> it<00:05:04.199> was<00:05:04.289> much<00:05:04.800> much<00:05:05.280> more

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
the packaging tape it was much much more

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.629 
the packaging tape it was much much more
difficult<00:05:05.780> just<00:05:06.780> took<00:05:07.020> forever<00:05:07.469> and<00:05:07.889> I'm

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:08.639 
difficult just took forever and I'm

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:10.580 
difficult just took forever and I'm
surprised<00:05:09.030> that<00:05:09.210> some<00:05:09.419> of<00:05:09.539> the<00:05:09.659> things<00:05:10.289> I<00:05:10.409> made

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
surprised that some of the things I made

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.020 
surprised that some of the things I made
back<00:05:10.770> in<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.919> day<00:05:11.099> actually<00:05:11.280> came<00:05:11.639> out<00:05:11.819> fairly

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
back in the day actually came out fairly

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.550 
back in the day actually came out fairly
well<00:05:12.240> even<00:05:12.659> though<00:05:12.750> I<00:05:12.780> wasn't<00:05:13.139> using<00:05:13.349> any

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
well even though I wasn't using any

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.230 
well even though I wasn't using any
packaging<00:05:14.069> tape<00:05:14.190> it<00:05:14.400> really<00:05:14.639> makes<00:05:14.849> me<00:05:15.030> wonder

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
packaging tape it really makes me wonder

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.529 
packaging tape it really makes me wonder
sometimes<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:17.069> working<00:05:17.280> on<00:05:17.520> the<00:05:17.849> part<00:05:18.120> of<00:05:18.389> his

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:18.539 
sometimes so working on the part of his

shoes the first time you I should get to

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:28.369 
shoes the first time you I should get to
see<00:05:26.699> the<00:05:26.849> red<00:05:27.030> color<00:05:27.270> it's<00:05:28.020> kind<00:05:28.139> of<00:05:28.229> that

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:31.939 
see the red color it's kind of that
bright<00:05:28.830> color<00:05:28.860> red<00:05:29.870> it's<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.930> great<00:05:31.319> contrast

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:31.949 
bright color red it's a great contrast

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:35.659 
bright color red it's a great contrast
for<00:05:32.279> the<00:05:32.370> rest<00:05:32.550> of<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.090> design<00:05:34.460> so<00:05:35.460> there's

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
for the rest of the design so there's

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.010 
for the rest of the design so there's
the<00:05:35.759> bottom<00:05:35.909> part<00:05:36.270> of<00:05:36.330> his<00:05:36.479> shoe<00:05:36.690> you<00:05:36.870> can

see right there so there's a one part
kind<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.039> peel<00:05:53.219> these<00:05:53.400> up<00:05:53.580> and<00:05:53.819> I'm<00:05:54.120> gonna

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:54.240 
kind of peel these up and I'm gonna

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.050 
kind of peel these up and I'm gonna
stick<00:05:54.449> them<00:05:54.539> down<00:05:54.779> right<00:05:55.050> there<00:05:55.740> and<00:05:56.060> then

stick them down right there and then
right<00:05:57.210> about<00:05:57.449> there<00:05:57.659> that's<00:05:57.900> the<00:05:58.139> other
