00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.740
 hello everybody I 'm here to see how 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.740
 it's done 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:24.800
 after you pass that little tip after 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.800
 You 'll wait and want to stay. 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.740
 then the enamel still you will catch passing 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.009
 the nail 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.730
 I think some three layers are good because 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.849
 one we are looking for transparent 

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.849
 [Music] 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.960
 You're just a little something to me. 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:36.160
 [Applause] 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:36.160
 the blurred hillside is but you want 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.040
 [Music] 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:59.120
 clear that the glow will stay that 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:03:02.260
 Way I think it's not going to make 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.260
 much in the case of the 

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:29.890
 My time at this is that she has a bad mood 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.890
 you did not want to think 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.720
 It's cool 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:28.049
 [Applause] 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.340
 to lower one layer 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.690
 I like my 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:06:15.960
 so people there when you finish the more 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.960
 fast 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.199
 mainly in the region of the 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:55.130
 so to paint the nail is one of the most 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:58.660
 daring who also came then lay 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.660
 on the nail 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:15.130
 I think 

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.130
 [Music] 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:25.940
 O 

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:38.389
 and that's it folks I hope I have helped 

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:38.389
 You are going and going
