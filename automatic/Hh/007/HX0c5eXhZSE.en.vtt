00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.980
 welcome to motocard.com for a few 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.830
 three hundred euros we can do with 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.870
 a carbon helmet and with a solar visor 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.500
 integrated this is the letter of 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:15.719
 presentation of ls 272 carbon a helmet 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.609
 which, as the name suggests, incorporates 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.609
 carbon fiber in its outer shell 

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.550
 ls 272 coal is a helmet that is 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.990
 composed of carbon fiber in its 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.900
 exterior in the calotte 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:35.970
 exterior is a helmet approved by the 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.760
 European regulations 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:42.120
 it's a helmet that also has a design 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.740
 that keeps a few lines in favor of a 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.320
 great aerodynamics are some lines 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:48.510
 aggressive very sporty lines in 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.310
 pro of this aerodynamics of which 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.890
 we are talking about his weight is about 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:55.200
 1,400 grams approximately a very heavy 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.150
 content if we take into account that 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.230
 we are in front of a helmet with a viewfinder 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.520
 solar integrated in its interior and this 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.580
 weight so content should be 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.979
 mainly to the composition of his 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.130
 that it is as we have said about 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.770
 carbon fiber this helmet is 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.510
 commercialize from sizes xxs 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.000
 up to sizes xxl 

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:23.570
 as for the helmet screen this 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.100
 has been made with lex have 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:30.040
 injected is very rigid 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.909
 and has an anti-scratch treatment and 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.799
 anti-fog this screen can be extracted 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.049
 thanks to this mechanism of the screen 

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.920
 that we found on either side of the 

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.369
 calotte of the same 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.680
 with a very easy system to operate and 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.509
 very intuitive without needing 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:49.610
 tools just turning 90 degrees 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.310
 the mechanism of the screen to side and 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.310
 side we can extract said screen 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.100
 this screen in addition to this treatment 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.360
 Anti-scratch and anti-fog 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.340
 We also commented we can 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.190
 incorporate the anti-fog pink sheet what 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.590
 that comes standard with the helmet and if we 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.810
 we go to the solar viewer that has integrated 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.300
 this helmet we will see that this solar viewer 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:16.360
 It is activated by two tabs that 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.040
 we found on the left side of the 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.610
 helmet shell in the most part 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.310
 lower and it's about two tabs a 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:28.050
 black and a red one the red one we will use it 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:30.420
 to knock down the solar viewfinder 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 and once the solar viewer is down 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.340
 this tab is completely 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.640
 hidden so by just pressing the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.340
 Black tab towards the back of the dock 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.370
 will cause the solar viewer to hide 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.370
 automatically quickly and easily 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.709
 in an intuitive way 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.989
 in terms of helmet ventilation 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.379
 this incorporates two entries of 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.720
 ventilation on the front in the 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.629
 most superior part are easy 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.099
 drive so we can 

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.770
 handle also with gloves 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.500
 thick posts 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:12.090
 and this ventilation through your 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.310
 channeling in the internal gps will direct 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:17.330
 the air towards the exit that we found 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:20.880
 in the back of the helmet also 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:23.760
 manipulable easily manipulated with 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.080
 some gloves and finally highlight this 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.200
 air intake that we found in the 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:30.750
 chin strap whose objective is to release 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.120
 of fog inside the screen of the 

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:35.520
 ls 2 ct 2 carbon as for the 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.800
 hull interiors these have been 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.770
 designed to offer a great 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.630
 On-the-go comfort plus optimal 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.000
 ventilation at all times proof of 

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:47.340
 this is this microperforated material that 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.080
 we found on the top of this 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.380
 padding that will provide us 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:56.230
 that optimal ventilation that we need 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.490
 at all times these these padded 

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.770
 have been designed for those 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:02.890
 users who also circulate with glasses 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:05.080
 to also offer them a 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.700
 optimal comfort on the move and its design 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.830
 as well 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:13.780
 has been made taking into account 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:16.000
 account for these types of aspects these 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.510
 padded are removable are washable 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.700
 they have a hygienic treatment but 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.490
 especially its great feature if 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.920
 we take out this element that comes as standard 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:30.830
 which is the chin covers 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:32.780
 is that these cushions 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:35.000
 the lateral padding of the helmet or 

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:37.250
 Cheeks can be inflated by 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.310
 an air pump that we found just 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:44.090
 on the inside of the chinrest and 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:47.390
 that pressing we can get to inflate 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:50.630
 these cheeks for this optimum 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:54.580
 running comfort that we need is 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:58.629
 this same air pump has another 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.550
 another button by which pressing it 

00:04:58.629 --> 00:05:03.969
 they will empty of air you are cheeks and 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:08.259
 will return to their initial position in 

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:09.969
 definitively we have a helmet that has 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.920
 all the features of a helmet 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:15.860
 sports tourism proof of it 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:18.110
 is the double buckle closure that has 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.090
 the only closure admitted in the 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:22.400
 circuits on the other hand there's also that 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.410
 highlight that as series elements 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.890
 apart from this one covers chin that we have 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:28.900
 mentioned a moment ago also 

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:31.540
 exists 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.660
 the nose covers that is also another 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.419
 item that comes standard with the helmet 

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:40.590
 and we definitely have a helmet in the s 

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:44.259
 272 carbon is a helmet that incorporates 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:47.680
 many more typical features of a 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:50.590
 high- end or premium range helmet 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.810
 a very contained price if all this 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.220
 we add carbon as an element 

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.770
 main helmet making 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:58.900
 we have a very light helmet and that keeps 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.639
 excellent value for money 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:03.960
 for any doubt or comment what 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:03.960
 you can leave in this video
