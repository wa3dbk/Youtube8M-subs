00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
my experience it's been a little

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.590 
my experience it's been a little
disappointing<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:31.730> we<00:00:32.730> expect<00:00:32.910> for<00:00:33.329> seven

disappointing but we expect for seven

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.979 
disappointing but we expect for seven
dollars<00:00:33.690> foot<00:00:34.520> then<00:00:35.520> again<00:00:35.820> i'm<00:00:36.300> still<00:00:36.809> using

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
dollars foot then again i'm still using

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.250 
dollars foot then again i'm still using
it<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.850> don't<00:00:38.850> know<00:00:38.910> why<00:00:39.590> I'll<00:00:40.590> actually<00:00:40.770> I<00:00:40.980> know

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:42.260 
it I don't know why I'll actually I know

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
it I don't know why I'll actually I know
because<00:00:43.260> it's<00:00:43.680> a<00:00:43.800> good<00:00:43.950> base<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.850> keeps

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
because it's a good base and it keeps

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.270 
because it's a good base and it keeps
your<00:00:45.239> nails<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.930> little<00:00:46.320> harder<00:00:46.680> than<00:00:46.980> it<00:00:47.010> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
your nails a little harder than it is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.130 
your nails a little harder than it is
but<00:00:47.610> it's<00:00:47.820> not<00:00:48.090> actually<00:00:48.510> making<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.899> nails

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
but it's not actually making the nails

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.619 
but it's not actually making the nails
harder<00:00:50.039> from<00:00:50.340> their<00:00:50.550> roots<00:00:50.730> or<00:00:51.030> they<00:00:51.510> don't

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
harder from their roots or they don't

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.470 
harder from their roots or they don't
grow<00:00:51.840> by<00:00:52.170> themselves<00:00:52.289> like<00:00:52.940> part<00:00:53.940> without<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
grow by themselves like part without the

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.160 
grow by themselves like part without the
nail<00:00:54.660> magic<00:00:55.129> so<00:00:58.609> it's<00:00:59.609> been<00:00:59.969> three<00:01:00.270> weeks<00:01:00.300> the

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
nail magic so it's been three weeks the

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.670 
nail magic so it's been three weeks the
growth<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:02.030> very<00:01:03.030> drastic

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
growth is not very drastic

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.900 
growth is not very drastic
but<00:01:05.600> you<00:01:06.600> know<00:01:06.720> I<00:01:06.780> guess<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.410> was<00:01:08.280> expecting<00:01:08.400> it

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:08.910 
but you know I guess I was expecting it

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.450 
but you know I guess I was expecting it
to<00:01:08.970> grow<00:01:09.300> it<00:01:10.070> even<00:01:11.070> though<00:01:11.160> it<00:01:11.280> will<00:01:11.400> be

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
to grow it even though it will be

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.410 
to grow it even though it will be
uncomfortable<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.150> me<00:01:12.950> to<00:01:13.950> grow<00:01:14.190> that<00:01:14.490> long<00:01:14.730> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
uncomfortable for me to grow that long I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.990 
uncomfortable for me to grow that long I
was<00:01:16.260> gonna<00:01:16.410> cut<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.830> off<00:01:16.950> anyway<00:01:17.310> but<00:01:17.729> I<00:01:17.760> just

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000
