eight<00:00:18.660> mile<00:00:18.840> run<00:00:19.109> no<00:00:19.470> problems<00:00:19.830> at<00:00:19.949> all<00:00:20.270> I

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:21.350 
eight mile run no problems at all I

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:24.349 
eight mile run no problems at all I
noticed<00:00:22.350> that<00:00:22.619> after<00:00:22.769> you<00:00:23.369> know<00:00:23.460> about<00:00:23.609> 150

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
noticed that after you know about 150

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.050 
noticed that after you know about 150
miles<00:00:24.539> they<00:00:24.840> really<00:00:25.080> started<00:00:25.380> wearing<00:00:25.560> down

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
miles they really started wearing down

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.759 
miles they really started wearing down
and<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.210> is<00:00:27.359> pretty<00:00:27.750> minimal<00:00:28.019> when<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.500> get<00:00:28.650> up

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
and it is pretty minimal when you get up

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
and it is pretty minimal when you get up
toward<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.099> ball<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> foot<00:00:29.939> nests<00:00:30.179> where

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
toward the ball of the foot nests where

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.049 
toward the ball of the foot nests where
I<00:00:30.660> tend<00:00:31.260> to<00:00:31.320> say<00:00:31.529> when<00:00:31.740> I'm<00:00:31.830> running<00:00:31.980> as<00:00:32.969> you
