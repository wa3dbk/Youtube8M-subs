really<00:01:11.620> that<00:01:11.830> I<00:01:11.860> think<00:01:12.100> the<00:01:12.159> first<00:01:12.430> one<00:01:12.610> I<00:01:12.640> see

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:12.970 
really that I think the first one I see

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.300 
really that I think the first one I see
is<00:01:13.180> is<00:01:13.870> the<00:01:14.229> fact<00:01:14.440> that<00:01:14.620> they<00:01:14.799> have<00:01:14.979> bugs

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:15.310 
is is the fact that they have bugs

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.800 
is is the fact that they have bugs
occasionally<00:01:15.940> to<00:01:16.060> come<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.450> through<00:01:16.690> the

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
occasionally to come in through the

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.260 
occasionally to come in through the
summertime<00:01:17.320> people<00:01:18.310> need<00:01:18.640> to<00:01:18.760> go<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.060> lake

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.270 
summertime people need to go to the lake

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:20.850 
summertime people need to go to the lake
and<00:01:19.510> they<00:01:19.600> run<00:01:19.810> out<00:01:19.840> of<00:01:19.960> water<00:01:20.320> during<00:01:20.710> the

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:20.860 
and they run out of water during the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.060 
and they run out of water during the
weekend<00:01:21.510> it's<00:01:22.510> possible<00:01:23.110> that<00:01:23.260> they<00:01:23.409> have

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
weekend it's possible that they have

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.859 
weekend it's possible that they have
don't<00:01:24.280> fertilize<00:01:24.640> and<00:01:25.180> so<00:01:25.299> the<00:01:25.420> planter<00:01:25.840> of

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
don't fertilize and so the planter of

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.359 
don't fertilize and so the planter of
the<00:01:26.049> basket<00:01:26.820> ends<00:01:27.820> up<00:01:27.940> running<00:01:28.180> out<00:01:28.510> of<00:01:28.540> food

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
the basket ends up running out of food

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.830 
the basket ends up running out of food
and<00:01:30.369> finally<00:01:30.700> sometimes<00:01:31.180> they<00:01:31.510> get<00:01:31.630> a<00:01:31.690> little

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
and finally sometimes they get a little

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.110 
and finally sometimes they get a little
bit<00:01:32.020> leggy<00:01:32.230> so<00:01:32.650> let's<00:01:33.280> deal<00:01:33.490> with<00:01:33.520> those<00:01:33.850> four

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:34.120 
bit leggy so let's deal with those four

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
the Colibri akoha will take a little bit

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.589 
the Colibri akoha will take a little bit
of<00:02:16.410> the<00:02:16.500> osteo<00:02:16.980> out<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.370> here<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.760> what<00:02:18.269> we<00:02:18.390> do

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of the osteo out of here and what we do

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.380 
of the osteo out of here and what we do
is<00:02:18.870> will<00:02:19.050> cause<00:02:19.319> these<00:02:19.680> plants<00:02:20.280> to<00:02:20.970> branch

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
is will cause these plants to branch

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.610 
is will cause these plants to branch
right<00:02:22.140> there<00:02:22.200> at<00:02:22.620> that<00:02:23.480> pinching<00:02:24.480> point<00:02:24.810> and

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
right there at that pinching point and

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.199 
right there at that pinching point and
now<00:02:25.739> you<00:02:25.799> don't<00:02:26.160> have<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.430> take<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> lot<00:02:26.910> at<00:02:27.060> any

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
now you don't have to take a lot at any

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.789 
now you don't have to take a lot at any
given<00:02:27.480> time<00:02:27.750> but<00:02:28.049> if<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.260> make<00:02:28.440> a<00:02:28.470> practice

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
given time but if you make a practice

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.420 
given time but if you make a practice
when<00:02:29.700> you're<00:02:29.849> taking<00:02:30.239> care<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.510> your<00:02:30.720> plant<00:02:31.019> or

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
when you're taking care of your plant or

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.430 
when you're taking care of your plant or
when<00:02:32.430> you're<00:02:32.549> watering<00:02:32.790> it<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.330> do<00:02:33.510> that<00:02:33.780> then

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
when you're watering it to do that then

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.309 
when you're watering it to do that then
what<00:02:34.680> will<00:02:34.830> happen<00:02:35.060> is<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.900> plant<00:02:37.140> will

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
what will happen is the plant will

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:39.559 
what will happen is the plant will
always<00:02:37.530> be<00:02:37.680> a<00:02:37.709> lot<00:02:37.860> fuller<00:02:38.220> at<00:02:38.730> the<00:02:39.150> same<00:02:39.329> time

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:39.569 
always be a lot fuller at the same time

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.000 
always be a lot fuller at the same time
if<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.720> got<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.900> long<00:02:40.140> runner<00:02:40.440> you<00:02:40.620> can<00:02:40.769> trim<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
if you got a long runner you can trim it

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.520 
if you got a long runner you can trim it
off<00:02:41.250> and<00:02:41.280> maintain<00:02:41.640> now<00:02:42.569> food<00:02:42.840> is<00:02:43.049> another<00:02:43.380> one

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
off and maintain now food is another one

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.380 
off and maintain now food is another one
shady<00:02:43.769> things<00:02:44.190> right<00:02:44.430> here<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.819> so<00:02:44.940> this<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.360> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
shady things right here and so this is a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.190 
shady things right here and so this is a
very<00:02:45.630> simple<00:02:46.049> fertilizer<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.160> use<00:02:47.310> Osmocote

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
very simple fertilizer to use Osmocote

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.539 
very simple fertilizer to use Osmocote
because<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.349> slow<00:02:49.590> release<00:02:49.920> it's<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.310> so

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
because it's slow release it's not so

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:52.670 
because it's slow release it's not so
hot<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.030> it<00:02:51.180> burns<00:02:51.390> a<00:02:51.569> hole<00:02:51.720> I<00:02:52.079> know<00:02:52.379> there's

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
hot that it burns a hole I know there's

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.100 
hot that it burns a hole I know there's
some<00:02:52.860> different<00:02:53.280> granular<00:02:54.269> type<00:02:54.480> fertilizers

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
some different granular type fertilizers

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.199 
some different granular type fertilizers
people<00:02:55.470> use<00:02:55.709> and<00:02:55.920> a<00:02:56.400> lot<00:02:56.430> of<00:02:56.579> times<00:02:56.819> I'll<00:02:57.030> see

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
people use and a lot of times I'll see

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.670 
people use and a lot of times I'll see
their<00:02:57.360> bring<00:02:57.660> their<00:02:57.810> basket<00:02:58.260> back<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.620> they

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
their bring their basket back and they

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.990 
their bring their basket back and they
burn<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.920> hole<00:02:59.190> right<00:02:59.220> through<00:02:59.430> the<00:02:59.670> middle<00:02:59.790> of

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
burn a hole right through the middle of

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.089 
burn a hole right through the middle of
it<00:03:00.120> but<00:03:00.599> if<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.810> use<00:03:01.049> the<00:03:01.230> Osmocote<00:03:01.769> you<00:03:01.920> don't

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
it but if you use the Osmocote you don't

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:03.979 
it but if you use the Osmocote you don't
have<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.430> problem<00:03:02.640> and<00:03:03.390> it<00:03:03.540> doesn't<00:03:03.840> take

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
have that problem and it doesn't take

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:05.390 
have that problem and it doesn't take
that<00:03:04.019> much<00:03:04.379> but<00:03:04.650> what<00:03:04.769> we<00:03:04.860> want<00:03:05.040> to<00:03:05.129> do<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.310> we

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
that much but what we want to do is we

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.030 
that much but what we want to do is we
just<00:03:05.430> want<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.819> take<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.150> Osmocote<00:03:06.720> and

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
just want to take that Osmocote and

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.309 
just want to take that Osmocote and
sprinkle<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.099> down<00:03:08.340> inside<00:03:08.940> okay<00:03:09.870> use<00:03:10.109> our

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:10.319 
sprinkle it down inside okay use our

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:12.110 
sprinkle it down inside okay use our
finger<00:03:10.769> to<00:03:10.920> work<00:03:11.130> that<00:03:11.340> into<00:03:11.549> the<00:03:11.700> soil<00:03:12.030> a

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
finger to work that into the soil a

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.569 
finger to work that into the soil a
little<00:03:12.209> bit<00:03:12.480> and<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:13.920> is<00:03:13.980> a<00:03:14.130> slow-release

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
little bit and this is a slow-release

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:16.099 
little bit and this is a slow-release
fertilizer<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.329> it's<00:03:15.420> not<00:03:15.569> all<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:15.989> to<00:03:16.049> be

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:16.109 
fertilizer so it's not all going to be

00:03:16.109 --> 00:03:19.160 
fertilizer so it's not all going to be
there<00:03:16.500> at<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.160> same<00:03:17.489> time<00:03:17.819> but<00:03:18.600> what<00:03:18.780> happens

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
there at the same time but what happens

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.960 
there at the same time but what happens
these<00:03:19.319> pearls<00:03:19.739> actually<00:03:20.220> swell<00:03:20.549> up<00:03:20.700> due<00:03:20.940> to

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
these pearls actually swell up due to

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:23.390 
these pearls actually swell up due to
the<00:03:21.120> hydraulic<00:03:21.599> pressure<00:03:21.840> inside<00:03:22.349> and<00:03:22.709> begin

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:23.400 
the hydraulic pressure inside and begin

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.550 
the hydraulic pressure inside and begin
to<00:03:23.579> release<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.180> fertility<00:03:24.540> and<00:03:24.930> there's

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
to release the fertility and there's

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.440 
to release the fertility and there's
different<00:03:26.040> coatings<00:03:26.579> that<00:03:26.700> dissolve<00:03:27.269> at

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
different coatings that dissolve at

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.210 
different coatings that dissolve at
different<00:03:27.780> times<00:03:27.989> which<00:03:28.560> is<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.739> lot<00:03:28.859> which<00:03:29.190> is

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
different times which is a lot which is

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.229 
different times which is a lot which is
what<00:03:29.489> allows<00:03:29.730> this<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.269> a<00:03:30.299> three<00:03:30.690> month

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239
