00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:09.380
 I can learn by entering Sakapon teacher and Tingui I will answer questions from now on 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:13.610
 It is a problem of saline solution 

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.250
 In Yes once this is decided to use the equation 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.600
 a 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 Well 200 grams of 15% salt water 200g 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:34.240
 In addition to this or 8% securities stylish do Gran and Farro Satie loss car made a number of 10 percent of staff 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.830
 Let's go 

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:44.560
 In not only his wife and child After Teki out I problems mix of saline problem 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:47.000
 Well I want to buy a beater-like head h Weight of salt water 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.650
 And then to write a concentration above 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.780
 Let's see 200 grams of salt water and x good luck from the horse good man 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:01:01.250
 How many g can you express by using the saline solution you bought or bought ? 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:05.720
 Please let me know so that is only before 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.450
 Mix this x Swordsman in reverse graw 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:13.030
 It becomes a middle wind 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.400
 It has entered into a salt contained therein Yes Well 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.490
 Come on now 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:25.009
 Do Now to the second Uragoshi say tight 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.770
 How do I calculate the amount of salt that is on the 15% shop page at 200 flow? 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.450
 Speaking of 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:36.630
 Weight of saline solution 2 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:40.049
 15 and why come out if you take over 10/100 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.400
 i love calculation and it becomes yoisho 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.690
 is 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.730
 It will come out with the explanation of 30g 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:51.830
 Let's go for the second one 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:53.830
 I think to be a form of expression in the Tteyuu xi but let's not write in situ 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.110
 If you do 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:59.930
 multiplied by the weight of the xde saline 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.159
 Of 100 minutes or 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:05.360
 Yes it is an issue 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.950
 Yes I think you go the next This is also 

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.950
 Naa scale salt water deaf 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.780
 l 100-10 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:25.690
 Let's not allowed to put this fighting 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:31.400
 Of course when I'm delivering it, I'm getting into it now, and the amount of large amount of salt I 'm getting into it now. 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:35.209
 I will go there tomorrow when I raise it, but I will reduce such voices 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:38.310
 So with the problem of saline 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.940
 Nude is salt-like 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.260
 2 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:46.260
 It's about making a copy machine 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 I'm waiting 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:54.240
 Out 30 and make in this 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 There is a box to 100 minutes of 8 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:01.350
 100 minutes 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:06.630
 10 brackets x 200 say 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:08.490
 Was 100 over from Mendokuse I not be reversed minute and this each fraud's role of the rear was 

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:15.020
 But it's fast 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:19.310
 If you take 100, 3000+ standing x is 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:28.130
 Junior high school x I am sorry 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:34.030
 a 3000 + first x is sap system 2000 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:37.530
 y water x = minor species of the line tax 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.970
 x will go out of the way 100 Goods 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.970
 So the answer is 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.819
 500g 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:53.630
 It will be the wind that policymakers Hey or 

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:58.300
 Please fly over the paper of building the formula with the amount of salt 

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:58.300
 Was just Sakamoto at 0 d 2 place to learn to
