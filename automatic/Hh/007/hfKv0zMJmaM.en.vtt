00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay so here we have the Rope over 25

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.190 
okay so here we have the Rope over 25
system<00:00:05.250> here's<00:00:06.210> a<00:00:06.299> box<00:00:06.509> unit<00:00:06.750> if<00:00:06.899> I'm<00:00:07.020> going<00:00:07.140> to

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
system here's a box unit if I'm going to

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.540 
system here's a box unit if I'm going to
go<00:00:07.290> ahead<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.529> use<00:00:07.620> this<00:00:07.710> for<00:00:07.890> demonstration

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
go ahead and use this for demonstration

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.669 
go ahead and use this for demonstration
which<00:00:09.210> one<00:00:09.450> do<00:00:09.599> you<00:00:09.630> want<00:00:09.870> remove<00:00:10.320> the<00:00:10.440> top<00:00:10.650> and

which one do you want remove the top and

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.740 
which one do you want remove the top and
then<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.219> here<00:00:11.300> you're<00:00:12.300> going<00:00:12.450> to<00:00:12.509> go<00:00:12.660> ahead

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
then from here you're going to go ahead

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.930 
then from here you're going to go ahead
and<00:00:12.960> see<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.920> think<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.280> I<00:00:14.490> believe<00:00:14.820> they

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
and see the I think it's I believe they

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.820 
and see the I think it's I believe they
call<00:00:15.089> it<00:00:15.210> the<00:00:15.330> auto<00:00:15.509> shutoff<00:00:15.900> valve<00:00:16.199> that's

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
call it the auto shutoff valve that's

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.160 
call it the auto shutoff valve that's
what<00:00:16.949> this<00:00:17.100> assembly<00:00:17.580> is<00:00:17.699> here<00:00:17.970> when<00:00:18.869> I<00:00:18.900> call

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
what this assembly is here when I call

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
what this assembly is here when I call
it<00:00:19.289> whirlpool<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.580> person<00:00:20.970> I<00:00:21.029> got<00:00:21.180> was<00:00:21.330> really

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
it whirlpool the person I got was really

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.840 
it whirlpool the person I got was really
snobby<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.260> I<00:00:22.439> had<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.949> go<00:00:23.039> through<00:00:23.250> through<00:00:23.789> a

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:23.850 
snobby and I had to go through through a

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.220 
snobby and I had to go through through a
bit<00:00:24.150> back<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.480> forth<00:00:24.570> before<00:00:24.990> they<00:00:25.109> actually

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
bit back and forth before they actually

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.800 
bit back and forth before they actually
explained<00:00:25.980> everything<00:00:26.250> to<00:00:26.430> me<00:00:26.699> but<00:00:26.880> what<00:00:27.779> you

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
explained everything to me but what you

have to do is you have to remove these
six<00:00:29.160> screws<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:30.380> they<00:00:31.380> use<00:00:31.710> what's<00:00:32.099> called

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
six screws here I they use what's called

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.790 
six screws here I they use what's called
a<00:00:32.460> torque<00:00:32.820> screw<00:00:33.239> you<00:00:34.170> can't<00:00:34.380> really<00:00:34.500> see<00:00:34.739> in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
a torque screw you can't really see in

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
a torque screw you can't really see in
this<00:00:34.860> video<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.579> star-shaped<00:00:35.880> screw

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
this video but it's a star-shaped screw

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.709 
this video but it's a star-shaped screw
after<00:00:37.110> you<00:00:37.530> remove<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.610> you've<00:00:39.270> unscrewed

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
after you remove this you've unscrewed

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.370 
after you remove this you've unscrewed
it<00:00:39.870> go<00:00:40.200> ahead<00:00:40.320> and<00:00:40.469> remove<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.950> screws

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:47.380 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.020 

and<00:00:48.380> once<00:00:48.830> you<00:00:48.920> move<00:00:49.070> it<00:00:49.250> you're<00:00:49.850> going<00:00:49.970> to

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 
and once you move it you're going to

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.300 
and once you move it you're going to
want<00:00:50.150> to<00:00:50.180> pull<00:00:50.360> out<00:00:50.480> this<00:00:50.600> unit<00:00:51.250> and<00:00:52.250> just

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
want to pull out this unit and just

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:55.120 
want to pull out this unit and just
place<00:00:52.670> it<00:00:52.700> on<00:00:52.850> the<00:00:52.940> side<00:00:53.710> and<00:00:54.710> then<00:00:54.890> you're

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:55.130 
place it on the side and then you're

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:57.790 
place it on the side and then you're
going<00:00:55.220> to<00:00:55.310> basically<00:00:55.430> reveal<00:00:56.060> the<00:00:56.420> inlets<00:00:57.290> for

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
going to basically reveal the inlets for

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.520 
going to basically reveal the inlets for
the<00:00:57.920> water<00:00:58.100> ins<00:00:58.430> outs<00:00:58.730> and<00:00:59.060> also<00:00:59.360> the<00:00:59.660> this<00:01:00.380> is

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
the water ins outs and also the this is

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.260 
the water ins outs and also the this is
what<00:01:00.860> they<00:01:01.010> call<00:01:01.130> diaphragms<00:01:01.700> now<00:01:01.910> when<00:01:02.120> you

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:02.270 
what they call diaphragms now when you

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:05.080 
what they call diaphragms now when you
basically<00:01:02.660> pull<00:01:02.840> it<00:01:02.960> out<00:01:03.080> it's<00:01:04.010> a<00:01:04.309> it's<00:01:05.000> a

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:05.090 
basically pull it out it's a it's a

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.910 
basically pull it out it's a it's a
rubbery<00:01:07.030> membrane<00:01:08.030> so<00:01:08.390> again<00:01:08.830> you're<00:01:09.830> going

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
rubbery membrane so again you're going

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.440 
rubbery membrane so again you're going
to<00:01:09.980> want<00:01:10.130> to<00:01:10.190> go<00:01:10.280> ahead<00:01:10.400> and<00:01:10.640> check<00:01:11.270> those

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
to want to go ahead and check those

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.730 
to want to go ahead and check those
those<00:01:11.750> are<00:01:11.870> most<00:01:12.110> likely<00:01:12.290> going<00:01:12.350> to<00:01:12.470> be<00:01:12.560> the

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
those are most likely going to be the

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:14.710 
those are most likely going to be the
cause<00:01:13.190> of<00:01:13.220> your<00:01:13.370> leaks<00:01:13.610> now<00:01:14.150> there's<00:01:14.330> two<00:01:14.510> main

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
cause of your leaks now there's two main

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.670 
cause of your leaks now there's two main

there's<00:01:16.550> two<00:01:16.790> diaphragms<00:01:17.780> one<00:01:18.680> on<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.800> top

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.010 
there's two diaphragms one on the top

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:20.469 
there's two diaphragms one on the top
and<00:01:19.340> then<00:01:19.610> one<00:01:19.880> there's<00:01:20.150> going<00:01:20.240> to<00:01:20.300> be<00:01:20.360> this

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.479 
and then one there's going to be this

plastic nickel shaped device here then

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.040 
plastic nickel shaped device here then
you<00:01:26.300> also<00:01:26.420> have<00:01:26.630> the<00:01:26.780> rim<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.490> may<00:01:28.490> have<00:01:28.670> to

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
you also have the rim you may have to

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.980 
you also have the rim you may have to
pull<00:01:30.050> that<00:01:30.170> out<00:01:30.550> and<00:01:31.550> at<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.729> bottom<00:01:31.960> you<00:01:32.960> have

this other diaphragm now this is the

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.810 
this other diaphragm now this is the
cause<00:01:35.510> of<00:01:35.540> my<00:01:35.810> my<00:01:36.500> out<00:01:36.680> reverse<00:01:37.460> osmosis

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.710 
blog is you could basically order these
or<00:01:52.970> $6<00:01:53.420> each<00:01:53.570> which<00:01:53.840> is<00:01:53.869> kind<00:01:54.140> of<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.289> ripoff<00:01:54.619> but

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
or $6 each which is kind of a ripoff but

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
or $6 each which is kind of a ripoff but
it<00:01:56.720> seems<00:01:56.960> like<00:01:57.080> they're<00:01:57.200> only<00:01:57.320> a<00:01:57.410> couple<00:01:57.440> of

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
it seems like they're only a couple of

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.310 
it seems like they're only a couple of
cents<00:01:58.130> maybe<00:01:58.340> fifteen<00:01:58.670> cents<00:01:58.910> worth<00:01:59.030> of<00:01:59.320> worth

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
cents maybe fifteen cents worth of worth

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.100 
cents maybe fifteen cents worth of worth
of<00:02:00.440> material<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.390> that's<00:02:02.390> what<00:02:02.660> whirlpool

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
of material but that's what whirlpool

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.139 
of material but that's what whirlpool
wants<00:02:03.500> so<00:02:03.729> another<00:02:04.729> than<00:02:04.820> that

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
wants so another than that

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:07.150 
wants so another than that
basically<00:02:05.450> this<00:02:05.600> is<00:02:05.690> empty<00:02:05.929> so<00:02:06.200> once<00:02:07.039> you

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
basically this is empty so once you

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.320 
basically this is empty so once you
replace<00:02:08.030> these<00:02:08.390> units<00:02:11.020> go<00:02:12.020> go<00:02:12.230> ahead<00:02:12.380> and

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
replace these units go go ahead and

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.940 
replace these units go go ahead and
totally<00:02:14.330> put<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.750> unit<00:02:15.050> back<00:02:15.610> face<00:02:16.610> down

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
totally put this unit back face down

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.460 
totally put this unit back face down
diaphragm<00:02:18.950> on<00:02:19.069> top

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.770 

and<00:02:25.850> then<00:02:26.850> you<00:02:26.910> just<00:02:27.090> place<00:02:27.270> this<00:02:27.390> unit<00:02:27.660> back

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
and then you just place this unit back

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.010 
and then you just place this unit back
on<00:02:27.960> you<00:02:28.950> put<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.460> screws<00:02:29.700> back<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:30.120> the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
on you put the screws back in the

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.840 
on you put the screws back in the
screens<00:02:31.530> without<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.920> washers<00:02:32.250> go<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.640> this

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:32.850 
screens without the washers go on this

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.150 
screens without the washers go on this
side<00:02:33.060> and<00:02:33.590> then<00:02:34.590> the<00:02:34.650> screws<00:02:34.920> with<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
side and then the screws with the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.060 
side and then the screws with the
washers<00:02:35.900> are<00:02:36.900> directly<00:02:37.290> over<00:02:37.560> the<00:02:37.620> diaphragm

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
washers are directly over the diaphragm

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:39.110 
washers are directly over the diaphragm
and<00:02:38.520> that's<00:02:38.700> it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
and that's it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:46.640 
and that's it
once<00:02:39.930> you<00:02:40.020> do<00:02:40.140> that<00:02:42.470> your<00:02:44.210> your<00:02:45.210> unit<00:02:45.510> will<00:02:46.470> no

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
once you do that your your unit will no

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.730 
once you do that your your unit will no
longer<00:02:46.830> leak<00:02:48.020> and<00:02:49.020> here's<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.320> replacement

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
longer leak and here's the replacement

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.110 
longer leak and here's the replacement
unit<00:02:49.770> I<00:02:50.040> have<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.520> this<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> actual

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
unit I have or this is the actual

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.000 
unit I have or this is the actual
original<00:02:51.300> unit<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:52.290> again<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.620> was<00:02:52.770> leaking

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
original unit and again it was leaking

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.510 
original unit and again it was leaking
from<00:02:53.160> here<00:02:53.670> at<00:02:54.480> least<00:02:54.690> two<00:02:54.840> holes<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.490> when<00:02:56.490> I

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
from here at least two holes and when I

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.100 
from here at least two holes and when I
actually<00:02:56.700> took<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.090> off<00:02:57.270> I<00:02:57.510> had<00:02:57.810> it<00:02:57.930> mounted

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
actually took it off I had it mounted

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.620 
actually took it off I had it mounted
underneath<00:02:58.560> here<00:02:58.940> when<00:02:59.940> I<00:03:00.000> took<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.240> off<00:03:00.360> I

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
underneath here when I took it off I

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.240 
underneath here when I took it off I
found<00:03:01.290> that<00:03:01.380> it<00:03:01.500> wasn't<00:03:01.620> really<00:03:01.830> leaking<00:03:02.160> from

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
found that it wasn't really leaking from

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.970 
found that it wasn't really leaking from
here<00:03:02.460> it<00:03:02.940> was<00:03:03.060> actually<00:03:03.300> leaking<00:03:03.450> from<00:03:04.230> from

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:04.980 
here it was actually leaking from from

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.240 
here it was actually leaking from from
around<00:03:05.610> the<00:03:05.760> diaphragm<00:03:06.030> section<00:03:06.540> I<00:03:07.250> also

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
around the diaphragm section I also

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.370 
around the diaphragm section I also
tried<00:03:08.640> to<00:03:08.820> tighten<00:03:09.420> these<00:03:09.660> bolts<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.230> that

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
tried to tighten these bolts but that

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.560 
tried to tighten these bolts but that
didn't<00:03:10.620> work<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.010> what<00:03:11.430> happens<00:03:11.700> is<00:03:11.820> when<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
didn't work and what happens is when the

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.910 
didn't work and what happens is when the
water<00:03:12.750> leaks<00:03:13.050> out<00:03:13.170> of<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.290> diaphragm<00:03:13.560> it

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
water leaks out of the diaphragm it

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.240 
water leaks out of the diaphragm it
collects<00:03:14.340> in<00:03:14.460> this<00:03:14.580> pool<00:03:14.850> area<00:03:15.150> and<00:03:16.250> those

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
collects in this pool area and those

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.340 
collects in this pool area and those
little<00:03:17.430> holes<00:03:17.730> which<00:03:18.240> we've<00:03:18.420> seen<00:03:18.540> them<00:03:18.660> they

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
little holes which we've seen them they

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.870 
little holes which we've seen them they
can't<00:03:19.560> are<00:03:19.710> there<00:03:19.860> are<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.250> only<00:03:20.400> outlets

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
can't are there are the only outlets

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.040 
can't are there are the only outlets
this<00:03:21.420> this<00:03:21.720> these<00:03:22.650> back<00:03:22.920> units<00:03:23.630> so<00:03:24.630> again<00:03:24.870> it's

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
this this these back units so again it's

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:26.810 
this this these back units so again it's
not<00:03:25.110> like<00:03:25.380> what<00:03:26.310> some<00:03:26.490> people<00:03:26.580> are<00:03:26.730> saying

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
not like what some people are saying

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:30.680 
not like what some people are saying
that<00:03:27.060> the<00:03:27.750> filters<00:03:28.170> are<00:03:28.790> totally<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.120> capacity

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:30.690 
that the filters are totally to capacity

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:33.440 
that the filters are totally to capacity
they'll<00:03:30.810> continue<00:03:31.050> to<00:03:31.230> work<00:03:31.410> until<00:03:32.420> for<00:03:33.420> a

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
they'll continue to work until for a

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.030 
they'll continue to work until for a
long<00:03:33.630> time<00:03:33.870> even<00:03:34.200> if<00:03:34.440> they're<00:03:34.590> completely

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
long time even if they're completely

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.930 
long time even if they're completely
useless<00:03:35.630> they<00:03:36.630> won't<00:03:36.840> cause<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.110> clog<00:03:37.940> it's

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
useless they won't cause the clog it's

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.030 
useless they won't cause the clog it's
what's<00:03:39.390> causing<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.840> leak<00:03:40.530> most<00:03:40.740> likely<00:03:40.950> is

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
what's causing the leak most likely is

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.140 
what's causing the leak most likely is
going<00:03:41.190> to<00:03:41.250> be<00:03:41.310> the<00:03:41.400> diaphragm<00:03:41.820> so<00:03:41.970> go<00:03:42.060> ahead

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
going to be the diaphragm so go ahead

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.210 
going to be the diaphragm so go ahead
and<00:03:42.360> check<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.140> remove<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.890> and<00:03:44.010> you<00:03:44.100> should

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
and check that remove it and you should

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.260 
and check that remove it and you should
be<00:03:44.280> able<00:03:44.340> to<00:03:44.520> get<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.760> fixed

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
be able to get that fixed

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:48.050 
be able to get that fixed
and<00:03:45.720> that's<00:03:45.840> it
