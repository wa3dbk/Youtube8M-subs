feeding the rats Chinese food let's talk
a<00:01:52.920> little<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.159> about<00:01:53.340> sugar<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:54.000> know<00:01:54.090> sugar

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
a little bit about sugar you know sugar

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
a little bit about sugar you know sugar
is<00:01:54.570> in<00:01:54.720> just<00:01:54.869> about<00:01:55.079> everything<00:01:55.409> these<00:01:55.710> days

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
is in just about everything these days

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.620 
is in just about everything these days
but<00:01:56.310> it's<00:01:56.460> not<00:01:56.640> maybe<00:01:56.909> for<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.210> reason<00:01:57.540> that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
but it's not maybe for the reason that

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.450 
but it's not maybe for the reason that
we<00:01:57.750> might<00:01:57.930> assume<00:01:58.229> wouldn't<00:01:59.070> you<00:01:59.130> put<00:01:59.280> sugar

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
we might assume wouldn't you put sugar

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.980 
we might assume wouldn't you put sugar
to<00:01:59.700> product<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.090> actually<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.509> something<00:02:00.719> it

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
to product it actually does something it

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.780 
to product it actually does something it
blocks<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.380> calcium<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.009> magnesium<00:02:02.189> from

getting into your body and guess what

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.050 
getting into your body and guess what
happens<00:02:04.860> when<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.189> don't<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:05.490> any<00:02:05.700> calcium

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
happens when you don't have any calcium

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.300 
happens when you don't have any calcium
magnesium<00:02:06.180> in<00:02:06.540> your<00:02:06.630> body<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:07.770> create<00:02:08.039> sugar

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
right we're gonna talk about the

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.229 
right we're gonna talk about the
artificial<00:02:25.680> taste<00:02:25.950> stimulators<00:02:26.849> here<00:02:27.120> so

there's really no flavor in them but

00:02:29.189 --> 00:02:30.619 
there's really no flavor in them but
what<00:02:29.370> they<00:02:29.489> do<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.790> they<00:02:29.909> go<00:02:30.030> in<00:02:30.060> and<00:02:30.209> they<00:02:30.269> play

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
what they do is they go in and they play

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.420 
what they do is they go in and they play
with<00:02:30.659> your<00:02:30.959> taste<00:02:31.230> buds<00:02:31.500> this<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.189> where<00:02:32.340> the

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
with your taste buds this is where the

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.580 
with your taste buds this is where the
scientists<00:02:32.879> dial<00:02:33.209> into<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.689> they<00:02:33.840> call<00:02:34.139> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
scientists dial into what they call to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.199 
scientists dial into what they call to
the<00:02:34.709> Bliss<00:02:35.069> point<00:02:35.099> they<00:02:35.579> want<00:02:35.760> to<00:02:35.849> have<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
the Bliss point they want to have you

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.610 
the Bliss point they want to have you
eating<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.719> the<00:02:36.810> point<00:02:36.989> where<00:02:37.109> you<00:02:37.230> can't<00:02:37.439> put

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
eating to the point where you can't put

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.170 
eating to the point where you can't put
the<00:02:37.739> food's<00:02:37.920> down<00:02:38.189> so<00:02:38.579> what<00:02:38.730> they<00:02:38.819> do<00:02:38.879> is<00:02:39.060> they

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
the food's down so what they do is they

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:40.670 
the food's down so what they do is they
block<00:02:39.510> the<00:02:39.689> negative<00:02:39.840> flavors<00:02:40.409> and<00:02:40.560> they

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
block the negative flavors and they

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.860 
block the negative flavors and they
enhance<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.159> good<00:02:41.400> ones<00:02:41.639> making<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.299> so<00:02:42.540> we

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
enhance the good ones making it so we

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.209 
enhance the good ones making it so we
can't<00:02:43.109> we<00:02:43.319> can't<00:02:43.469> stop<00:02:43.680> eating<00:02:43.829> these<00:02:44.010> foods
