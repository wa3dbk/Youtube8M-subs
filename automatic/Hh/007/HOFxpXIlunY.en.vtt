00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.720
 Today we make healthy lupins or chochos Mila shows us the lupins and we put them 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:25.329
 soaking 24 hours this one almost runs away 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:28.779
 the next day at the same time this is how they look, 

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.470
 they are already hydrated, we wash them and we start. 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:43.660
 In a pot we heat water and add a spoonful of salt 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:47.280
 we spill the chochos and since it boils we will have 20 minutes 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:56.290
 We wait for it to cool a little and Enrique starts to strain them and wash them. 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:21.159
 We put them in a bowl and cover them with water 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:26.960
 and a spoonful of salt are already made but they are inedible, 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.620
 now it is about losing the bitterness by changing the water twice a day. 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.560
 The best thing not to forget is to have a routine, every day at breakfast 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.610
 and after dinner for example, so it will not happen to you 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.850
 The best thing to do is to test them until five or seven days 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.880
 are to your taste to enjoy them better can not miss a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:14.830
 beer and that's how they are 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:28.430
 We hope you like it and health for all.
