00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:35.550 
down the dumps right then even there to

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:37.460 
down the dumps right then even there to
be<00:03:35.670> successful<00:03:36.240> you<00:03:36.270> be<00:03:36.930> able<00:03:37.050> just<00:03:37.260> started

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
be successful you be able just started

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.840 
be successful you be able just started
to<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.680> accept<00:03:38.160> the<00:03:38.310> fact<00:03:38.520> that<00:03:38.580> that<00:03:38.730> was

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
to just accept the fact that that was

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.440 
to just accept the fact that that was
likely<00:03:39.500> right<00:03:40.500> so<00:03:41.490> we<00:03:41.730> can<00:03:41.850> take<00:03:42.000> chances<00:03:42.390> you

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
likely right so we can take chances you

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.030 
likely right so we can take chances you
can<00:03:42.690> get<00:03:42.810> out<00:03:42.900> there<00:03:43.080> take<00:03:43.380> crits<00:03:43.650> then<00:03:43.830> turned

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
can get out there take crits then turned

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.770 
can get out there take crits then turned
out<00:03:44.130> what<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.370> know<00:03:44.490> so<00:03:45.240> the<00:03:45.330> trick<00:03:45.540> is<00:03:45.570> never

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
out what you know so the trick is never

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.340 
out what you know so the trick is never
practice<00:03:46.740> like<00:03:47.070> the<00:03:47.220> team<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:48.350> failing

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350
