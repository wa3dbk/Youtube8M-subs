people through where they needed to go i

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
people through where they needed to go i

guess i said because we're service
desperate<00:00:29.460> i<00:00:29.550> really<00:00:29.760> put<00:00:29.970> into<00:00:30.240> one<00:00:30.330> of<00:00:30.449> the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
desperate i really put into one of the

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.030 
desperate i really put into one of the
bases<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:32.189> would<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:33.149> on<00:00:33.630> as<00:00:34.530> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.829> see

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
bases so that would go on as you can see

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.459 
bases so that would go on as you can see
there's<00:00:35.250> a<00:00:35.280> little<00:00:35.430> button<00:00:35.640> here<00:00:35.820> which<00:00:36.469> is

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
there's a little button here which is

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.160 
there's a little button here which is
connected<00:00:38.219> to<00:00:38.460> some<00:00:38.879> of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.120> there<00:00:39.719> right<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
connected to some of the there right the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.170 
connected to some of the there right the
wire<00:00:40.379> i'm<00:00:40.800> going<00:00:41.070> to<00:00:41.129> call<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.340> wired<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:42.030> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
wire i'm going to call it wired up so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.500 
wire i'm going to call it wired up so
that's<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.629> because<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:43.079> easier<00:00:44.360> so<00:00:45.360> this

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
that's just because it's easier so this

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
that's just because it's easier so this
button<00:00:45.780> is<00:00:45.840> connected<00:00:46.230> to<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.410> wire<00:00:46.770> as<00:00:47.190> you

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879 
button is connected to this wire as you

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.700 
button is connected to this wire as you
can<00:00:48.090> see<00:00:48.360> from<00:00:48.570> down<00:00:48.780> here<00:00:49.110> it's<00:00:49.350> kind<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.559> hard

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
can see from down here it's kind of hard

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.260 
can see from down here it's kind of hard
to<00:00:49.739> tell<00:00:49.950> from<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> side<00:00:50.430> angle<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.180> a

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to tell from the side angle but that's a

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.680 
to tell from the side angle but that's a
door<00:00:51.539> which<00:00:52.350> is<00:00:52.530> also<00:00:52.770> connected<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.690> over

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
door which is also connected to over

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.260 
door which is also connected to over
there<00:00:54.960> through<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.620> same<00:00:56.010> wire<00:00:56.280> but<00:00:57.149> you

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
there through the same wire but you

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.750 
there through the same wire but you
can't<00:00:57.600> see<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.230> wire<00:00:58.440> I've<00:00:59.010> got<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.460> hidden

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
can't see the wire I've got it hidden

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.450 
can't see the wire I've got it hidden
underneath<00:01:00.300> this<00:01:00.989> wool<00:01:01.890> which<00:01:02.219> i've<00:01:02.370> been

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
using just for building purposes it's

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.760 
using just for building purposes it's
easy<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.799> destroy<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.519> whatever<00:01:05.939> so<00:01:06.869> this<00:01:07.740> is

luck<00:01:54.120> wiring<00:01:54.690> down<00:01:54.930> first<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.560> then<00:01:57.020> actually

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
luck wiring down first and then actually

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.440 
luck wiring down first and then actually
I<00:01:58.050> think<00:01:58.080> I<00:01:58.230> had<00:01:58.320> or<00:01:58.800> down<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.640> I<00:01:59.790> wired<00:02:00.060> it<00:02:00.270> all

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
I think I had or down and I wired it all

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.060 
I think I had or down and I wired it all
together<00:02:00.690> and<00:02:01.140> the<00:02:01.410> check<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.860> i<00:02:01.890> was

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
together and the check that i was

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.880 
together and the check that i was
working<00:02:02.490> i<00:02:02.670> was<00:02:02.790> using<00:02:02.970> this<00:02:03.150> power<00:02:03.420> source

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:03.890 
working i was using this power source

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.470 
working i was using this power source
instead<00:02:04.890> of<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.160> button<00:02:05.430> just<00:02:05.820> go<00:02:06.240> ahead<00:02:06.390> and

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:06.480 
instead of the button just go ahead and

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.390 
instead of the button just go ahead and
have<00:02:06.630> to<00:02:06.810> click<00:02:07.230> it<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.410> it's<00:02:07.680> always<00:02:07.830> on<00:02:10.400> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
have to click it and it's always on so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.190 
have to click it and it's always on so
yeah<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:11.850> lay<00:02:12.000> down<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.270> wire<00:02:12.450> first<00:02:12.870> and

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
yeah so you lay down the wire first and

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.370 
yeah so you lay down the wire first and
then<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.890> cover<00:02:14.340> it<00:02:14.520> up<00:02:14.760> which<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.840> an<00:02:15.990> issue<00:02:16.170> i

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 
then you cover it up which is an issue i

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.350 
then you cover it up which is an issue i
was<00:02:16.500> having<00:02:16.650> with<00:02:17.160> before<00:02:17.370> because<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:17.880> didn't

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
was having with before because I didn't

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.300 
was having with before because I didn't
like<00:02:18.720> it<00:02:18.990> wouldn't<00:02:19.440> work<00:02:19.650> for<00:02:19.710> me<00:02:19.920> later<00:02:20.190> if

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
like it wouldn't work for me later if

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.500 
like it wouldn't work for me later if
you<00:02:20.490> story<00:02:21.650> also<00:02:22.650> another<00:02:23.100> issue<00:02:23.430> with<00:02:24.210> the

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
you story also another issue with the

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.920 
you story also another issue with the
wiring<00:02:25.470> is<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.580> only<00:02:26.700> has<00:02:27.000> like<00:02:27.450> 16

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
wiring is that it only has like 16

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.680 
wiring is that it only has like 16
blocks<00:02:28.200> I<00:02:28.440> think<00:02:28.650> it<00:02:28.770> is<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:29.250> work<00:02:29.460> in<00:02:29.700> the<00:02:30.510> door

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
blocks I think it is to work in the door

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.370 
blocks I think it is to work in the door
being<00:02:30.900> the<00:02:31.050> 16th<00:02:31.560> block<00:02:31.830> so<00:02:33.290> what's<00:02:34.290> another

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
being the 16th block so what's another

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.290 
being the 16th block so what's another
constraint<00:02:35.340> that<00:02:35.490> you're<00:02:35.700> having<00:02:36.060> issues

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
constraint that you're having issues

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:38.270 
constraint that you're having issues
with<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.840> tried<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.350> figure<00:02:37.530> out<00:02:37.740> a<00:02:37.770> thing<00:02:38.040> over

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
with I tried to figure out a thing over

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.350 
with I tried to figure out a thing over
here<00:02:39.110> height<00:02:40.110> doesn't<00:02:40.500> matter<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.940> can<00:02:42.090> go<00:02:42.330> up

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
here height doesn't matter it can go up

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:44.360 
here height doesn't matter it can go up
we're<00:02:42.930> down<00:02:43.110> either<00:02:43.500> way<00:02:43.680> it<00:02:43.920> doesn't<00:02:43.980> matter

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
we're down either way it doesn't matter

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.160 
we're down either way it doesn't matter
it<00:02:44.730> will<00:02:44.940> still<00:02:45.180> activate<00:02:45.630> all<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:45.900> way<00:02:45.990> down

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
it will still activate all the way down

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.910 
it will still activate all the way down
to<00:02:46.470> the<00:02:46.500> end<00:02:48.980> but

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
to the end but

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.980 
to the end but
see<00:02:51.490> like<00:02:51.910> I<00:02:52.030> was<00:02:52.150> trying<00:02:52.360> to<00:02:52.420> have<00:02:52.569> like<00:02:52.630> an

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
see like I was trying to have like an

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.650 
see like I was trying to have like an
infinite<00:02:53.530> power<00:02:53.680> source<00:02:54.030> at<00:02:55.030> one<00:02:55.300> end<00:02:55.480> and

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
infinite power source at one end and

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.830 
infinite power source at one end and
then<00:02:56.560> down<00:02:56.800> here<00:02:57.130> at<00:02:57.730> another<00:02:58.030> La<00:02:58.330> Cava<00:02:58.540> an

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
then down here at another La Cava an

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.930 
then down here at another La Cava an
activation<00:02:59.349> switch<00:02:59.650> so<00:03:00.430> it<00:03:00.489> would<00:03:00.700> reach

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:00.940 
activation switch so it would reach

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.470 
activation switch so it would reach
farther<00:03:01.420> using<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.260> wiring<00:03:02.800> but<00:03:03.520> I<00:03:03.880> could<00:03:04.330> not

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
farther using the wiring but I could not

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.380 
farther using the wiring but I could not
get<00:03:04.720> that<00:03:04.810> to<00:03:04.989> work<00:03:06.000> hopefully<00:03:07.000> someone<00:03:07.239> else

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
get that to work hopefully someone else

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.660 
get that to work hopefully someone else
can<00:03:07.540> figure<00:03:07.840> that<00:03:08.020> out<00:03:08.080> because<00:03:08.980> I<00:03:09.370> think<00:03:09.430> yeah

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
can figure that out because I think yeah

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.870 
can figure that out because I think yeah
right<00:03:09.940> now<00:03:10.950> so<00:03:11.950> instead<00:03:12.400> of<00:03:12.459> how<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.670> like

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
right now so instead of how you like

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.970 
right now so instead of how you like
this<00:03:13.750> full<00:03:14.140> 16<00:03:14.980> length<00:03:15.280> track<00:03:15.819> and<00:03:16.209> then<00:03:17.080> like

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
this full 16 length track and then like

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.270 
this full 16 length track and then like
the<00:03:18.100> door<00:03:18.340> being<00:03:18.700> here<00:03:19.290> which<00:03:20.290> is<00:03:20.470> where<00:03:20.739> it

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
the door being here which is where it

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.280 
the door being here which is where it
should<00:03:21.310> end<00:03:21.610> that<00:03:22.030> this<00:03:22.209> is<00:03:22.390> like<00:03:22.569> 16th<00:03:23.080> lok

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
should end that this is like 16th lok

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.620 
should end that this is like 16th lok
from<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.769> distance<00:03:26.730> so<00:03:27.730> instead<00:03:28.239> of<00:03:28.300> like

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
from this distance so instead of like

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.220 
from this distance so instead of like
having<00:03:28.900> it<00:03:29.200> all<00:03:30.190> the<00:03:30.519> way<00:03:30.580> down<00:03:30.850> I<00:03:31.180> want<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.810> 16

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
having it all the way down I want the 16

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.830 
having it all the way down I want the 16
blocks<00:03:32.470> and<00:03:32.890> then<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.819> continue<00:03:34.150> on<00:03:34.510> down

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:34.840 
blocks and then like to continue on down

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:37.039 
blocks and then like to continue on down
around<00:03:35.049> a<00:03:35.170> corner<00:03:35.440> or<00:03:36.310> something<00:03:36.459> like<00:03:36.700> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
around a corner or something like that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.430 
around a corner or something like that
so<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.260> I<00:03:38.290> could<00:03:38.470> have<00:03:38.799> like<00:03:39.069> a<00:03:40.319> power<00:03:41.319> supply

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
so that I could have like a power supply

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.370 
so that I could have like a power supply
here<00:03:42.420> ok<00:03:43.420> new<00:03:43.930> boiler<00:03:44.410> up<00:03:44.880> over<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:47.230> we're

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:47.380 
here ok new boiler up over so we're

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:49.430 
here ok new boiler up over so we're
diagonally<00:03:47.799> maybe<00:03:48.430> that's

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
diagonally maybe that's

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:53.180 
diagonally maybe that's
we<00:03:49.950> get<00:03:50.070> ours<00:03:50.310> play<00:03:50.580> there<00:03:50.960> so<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:52.190> instead

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
we get ours play there so that instead

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.800 
we get ours play there so that instead
of<00:03:53.340> like<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.970> always<00:03:54.120> having<00:03:54.540> the<00:03:54.600> door

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
of like it always having the door

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.020 
of like it always having the door
trigger<00:03:55.110> hoping<00:03:55.590> that<00:03:56.130> I<00:03:56.160> can<00:03:56.280> push<00:03:56.610> a<00:03:56.640> switch

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
trigger hoping that I can push a switch

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.690 
trigger hoping that I can push a switch
and<00:03:57.240> have<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.450> extent<00:03:57.990> let<00:03:58.680> extend<00:03:59.160> this<00:03:59.400> part

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
and have it extent let extend this part

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.630 
and have it extent let extend this part
down<00:03:59.940> like<00:04:00.630> finishing<00:04:01.170> the<00:04:01.440> circuit<00:04:01.830> all<00:04:02.100> the

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640 
down like finishing the circuit all the

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:05.030 
down like finishing the circuit all the
way<00:04:02.730> down<00:04:02.970> but<00:04:03.870> I<00:04:04.110> wouldn't<00:04:04.650> work<00:04:04.800> because

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
way down but I wouldn't work because

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.830 
way down but I wouldn't work because

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:07.150 
looks like that's working also so as

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.150 
looks like that's working also so as
long<00:05:07.270> as<00:05:07.330> you<00:05:07.570> keep<00:05:07.840> that<00:05:08.290> diagonal<00:05:08.770> block

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.160 
long as you keep that diagonal block

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.490 
long as you keep that diagonal block
where<00:05:09.400> it<00:05:09.460> steps<00:05:09.790> down<00:05:10.230> because<00:05:11.230> that's<00:05:11.380> what

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 
where it steps down because that's what

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.890 
where it steps down because that's what
I<00:05:11.560> have<00:05:11.710> set<00:05:12.010> up<00:05:12.130> right<00:05:12.280> here<00:05:12.510> it's<00:05:13.510> actually<00:05:13.660> a

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
I have set up right here it's actually a

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.540 
I have set up right here it's actually a
step<00:05:14.200> down<00:05:14.680> from<00:05:15.330> inside<00:05:16.330> here<00:05:17.010> or<00:05:18.010> step<00:05:18.340> up

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
step down from inside here or step up

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.330 
step down from inside here or step up
however<00:05:19.180> you<00:05:19.270> look<00:05:19.390> at<00:05:19.510> it<00:05:19.570> he<00:05:19.810> goes<00:05:19.990> there<00:05:20.590> and

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:21.340 
however you look at it he goes there and

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:28.320 
however you look at it he goes there and
then<00:05:21.640> steps<00:05:22.090> up<00:05:22.360> right<00:05:22.900> here<00:05:24.810> Cupid<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:28.060> steps

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
then steps up right here Cupid it steps

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:41.740 
then steps up right here Cupid it steps
up<00:05:28.480> right<00:05:28.690> there<00:05:28.990> to<00:05:29.500> the

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.560 

nope<00:05:42.350> stewards<00:05:42.920> okay<00:05:43.550> so<00:05:43.940> even<00:05:44.300> though<00:05:44.390> that

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:44.570 
nope stewards okay so even though that

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.850 
nope stewards okay so even though that
looks<00:05:44.780> like<00:05:44.930> it<00:05:45.110> shouldn't<00:05:45.380> work<00:05:45.530> it's<00:05:45.800> still

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 
looks like it shouldn't work it's still

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.340 
looks like it shouldn't work it's still
breaking<00:05:46.510> looks<00:05:47.510> like<00:05:47.570> it's<00:05:47.780> not<00:05:47.900> connected

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:48.350 
breaking looks like it's not connected

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:50.830 
breaking looks like it's not connected
like<00:05:48.560> it's<00:05:48.710> one<00:05:48.890> of<00:05:48.980> them<00:05:49.180> as<00:05:50.180> if<00:05:50.420> I<00:05:50.510> would<00:05:50.570> just

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:50.840 
like it's one of them as if I would just

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.260 
like it's one of them as if I would just
put<00:05:51.200> piece<00:05:51.740> down<00:05:51.920> like<00:05:52.100> that<00:05:52.250> but<00:05:52.730> it's

00:05:53.260 --> 00:05:53.270 
put piece down like that but it's

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.790 
put piece down like that but it's
connected<00:05:53.750> apparently<00:05:55.420> so<00:05:56.420> yeah<00:05:56.530> that's<00:05:57.530> the

00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:57.800 
connected apparently so yeah that's the

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.040 
connected apparently so yeah that's the
video<00:05:58.070> on<00:05:58.250> how<00:05:58.400> to<00:05:58.430> get<00:05:58.640> a<00:05:58.700> working<00:05:59.060> door<00:05:59.750> I

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
video on how to get a working door I

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:04.930 
video on how to get a working door I
guess<00:06:00.440> it<00:06:00.650> looks<00:06:00.680> clean<00:06:00.980> nice<00:06:03.460> day<00:06:04.460> zombie<00:06:04.700> for

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:04.940 
guess it looks clean nice day zombie for

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:09.670 
guess it looks clean nice day zombie for
a<00:06:05.210> killer<00:06:05.540> squids<00:06:06.490> all<00:06:07.490> right
