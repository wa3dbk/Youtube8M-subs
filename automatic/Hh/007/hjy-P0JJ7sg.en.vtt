00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:13.350
 [Music] 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.470
 [Applause] 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:18.270
 Halli hello you look like the mgv and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.940
 certainly not kennedy here you know her 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.510
 still our old pentium 4 pc on 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:28.740
 socket 478 here in the picture yes the good old 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.840
 friend has served his time 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.610
 not only performance but also of 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.220
 his service so to speak 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.750
 and here is his successor is indeed 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.900
 not so brute great the system 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.360
 is still based on a pentium d 840's 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.610
 though old and relatively slow and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.730
 hot and so on, but still four times 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.780
 so quickly and the best the 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.760
 whole system is 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:55.080
 I've always done this from here 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.640
 about half an hour and it is 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.180
 already broken is already working 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.690
 no more 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.159
 I have the one since 2006 started 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.320
 First of all I am healthy what the problem 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:06.090
 because I really have everything 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.799
 tried what i ever in mine 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.530
 complete pc career-off has calm and 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.850
 it was fine then I'm fine 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.500
 the first time the power supply is defective 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.450
 I can not do it now but worldwide 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.060
 especially when he is from the 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:25.170
 dimensioning ago actually still in front 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.189
 the frame is good but if that 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.640
 all times now connected 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.170
 power adapter 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:40.890
 But if you try it here 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:42.869
 to turn on the button nothing at the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.820
 is of course very annoying and out of the 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 reason i suggest we test now 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.789
 the power supply we do not need much 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.310
 but only here in the picture a cable 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:56.820
 or for the electronics among us one 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.829
 You are not allowed to conduct the lines 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.549
 Under ground lay cable under 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.289
 lose the earth 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:07.109
 but that is only incidental with it 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.310
 Of course you can test it 

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:09.750
 not complete function of the power supply 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.400
 so but test after all, whether it's at 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.790
 The fan is spinning and something like that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.220
 that works then you have to 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.240
 your goal here is the one I have 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.440
 especially the meaning of the camera 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.460
 turned on to see that better 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:25.350
 can you have the 20 + 4 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.700
 but we take the 20 to go 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.890
 it's the 20 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.330
 the plug that comes from mainboard 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.620
 usually I find the socket now 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.030
 just not there and hid 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.410
 under the wire harness wiring here 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.769
 you have to now you see here the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.870
 green that is the power supply 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.870
 understands this line under power and 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.180
 that is bridge so that I am 14 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.950
 Here the green as the poisonous green is 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.599
 am 14 and now you have to go to one 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.660
 black bridges always here black 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:55.980
 I'll do it all here now 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.120
 I have that he already prepared by 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:02.160
 me the hoppala one here so in 14 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:04.920
 In this case, buxe is now full 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:07.530
 are already at the end of the line 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.410
 and there are others we are in now what 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.959
 never change then take the time here 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:16.400
 I do not want to take care of her now 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.400
 Do not put the air in the wrong place 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.040
 because otherwise, depending on the model that 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.500
 We want to damage the knife 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:27.599
 I would have folded anyway I think 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.900
 the whole time now here next to two so 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:32.970
 and how you are determined to do this 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:34.620
 collection hard disk noise 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:42.239
 have the whole state I can still do that 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:43.180
 sometimes they make something difficult I go 

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.610
 in here 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.400
 [Music] 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.800
 and the hard drive goes up, that is 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.950
 the power supply has turned on the wheel there 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.570
 seen is not direct and goes further 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:59.110
 the endless search has to be there either 

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:00.180
 be a short circuit somewhere but me 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:02.230
 do not understand where 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.700
 Well I will definitely have a video 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.160
 do this is lossless fight as more 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.730
 what to look for first thank you for 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:09.300
 watch 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.620
 I hope you know could press now 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.650
 fun aside, I hope you know now 

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:16.500
 how you could bridge your power supply 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.580
 and thus without mainboard turns on 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.140
 what ever you the brauchtum 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.260
 so fit for testing by a few 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.580
 LEDs iz spent if you can 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:26.980
 no model building application in front of you 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.120
 has it always helps otherwise yes 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.890
 thanks for watching and until the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.960
 next video which in any case with 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.560
 the pc to do that can you tell good 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.560
 that she
