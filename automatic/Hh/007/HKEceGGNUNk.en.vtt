window case now this is a European

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:15.289 
window case now this is a European
version<00:00:13.980> so<00:00:14.370> I'm<00:00:14.580> gonna<00:00:14.759> give<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.030> idea

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
version so I'm gonna give you the idea

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:16.550 
version so I'm gonna give you the idea
how<00:00:15.450> it<00:00:15.540> works<00:00:15.719> even<00:00:16.109> though<00:00:16.230> it's<00:00:16.320> gonna<00:00:16.410> be

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
how it works even though it's gonna be

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.170 
how it works even though it's gonna be
slightly<00:00:16.830> different<00:00:17.369> for<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.640> US<00:00:17.789> versions

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
slightly different for the US versions

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.580 
slightly different for the US versions
but<00:00:18.390> all<00:00:18.539> you<00:00:18.660> do<00:00:18.750> is<00:00:18.869> pop<00:00:19.080> it<00:00:19.230> in<00:00:19.289> like<00:00:19.320> that

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
but all you do is pop it in like that

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.900 
but all you do is pop it in like that
it's<00:00:19.890> that<00:00:20.100> simple<00:00:20.400> right

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it's that simple right

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.400 
it's that simple right
phone's<00:00:21.210> not<00:00:21.390> gonna<00:00:21.539> go<00:00:21.689> anywhere<00:00:21.900> it<00:00:22.170> comes

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
phone's not gonna go anywhere it comes

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.130 
phone's not gonna go anywhere it comes
out<00:00:22.560> almost<00:00:22.949> as<00:00:23.070> easily<00:00:23.250> though<00:00:23.580> and<00:00:24.050> give<00:00:25.050> you

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
out almost as easily though and give you

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.810 
out almost as easily though and give you
a<00:00:25.170> quick<00:00:25.410> walkthrough<00:00:25.650> of<00:00:25.980> how<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.609> case

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
a quick walkthrough of how the case

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.730 
a quick walkthrough of how the case
looks<00:00:27.119> and<00:00:27.330> works<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.779> open<00:00:28.320> it<00:00:28.410> up<00:00:28.500> you<00:00:28.619> see

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
looks and works so open it up you see

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.710 
looks and works so open it up you see
the<00:00:28.859> screen<00:00:29.070> close<00:00:29.849> it<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.240> you<00:00:30.449> get<00:00:30.570> some

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
the screen close it and you get some

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.900 
the screen close it and you get some
information<00:00:31.289> in<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.529> little<00:00:31.740> window<00:00:31.910> before

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
information in the little window before

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.459 
information in the little window before
we<00:00:33.030> dive<00:00:33.180> into<00:00:33.360> that<00:00:33.480> though<00:00:33.690> just<00:00:33.930> walk<00:00:34.320> you

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
we dive into that though just walk you

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.780 
we dive into that though just walk you
through<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.710> case<00:00:34.890> so<00:00:35.100> it's<00:00:35.219> got<00:00:35.370> a<00:00:35.399> nice

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
through the case so it's got a nice

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.479 
through the case so it's got a nice
little<00:00:36.090> kind<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.360> fetched<00:00:36.840> pattern<00:00:37.800> to<00:00:37.980> it<00:00:38.129> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
little kind of fetched pattern to it a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
little kind of fetched pattern to it a
little<00:00:39.059> bit<00:00:39.180> of<00:00:39.300> texture<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.690> feels<00:00:39.899> good<00:00:40.110> the

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
little bit of texture it feels good the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.660 
little bit of texture it feels good the
hinge<00:00:40.590> could<00:00:40.980> be<00:00:41.100> a<00:00:41.129> little<00:00:41.550> more

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
hinge could be a little more

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.430 
hinge could be a little more
sophisticated<00:00:42.329> I<00:00:42.510> think<00:00:42.719> it's<00:00:42.899> not<00:00:43.050> quite<00:00:43.320> as

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
sophisticated I think it's not quite as

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.200 
sophisticated I think it's not quite as
good<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.710> what<00:00:44.070> Samsung<00:00:44.280> does<00:00:44.640> but<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:44.940> okay

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
good as what Samsung does but it's okay

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.630 
good as what Samsung does but it's okay
a<00:00:45.870> nice<00:00:46.260> thin<00:00:46.590> shell<00:00:46.860> doesn't<00:00:47.280> really<00:00:47.430> add

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
a nice thin shell doesn't really add

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.090 
a nice thin shell doesn't really add
much<00:00:47.879> bulk<00:00:48.180> onto<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.570> phone<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.320> protect

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
much bulk onto the phone you do protect

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.860 
much bulk onto the phone you do protect
the<00:00:50.219> camera<00:00:50.520> a<00:00:50.550> little<00:00:50.820> bit<00:00:50.940> by<00:00:51.239> recessing<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
the camera a little bit by recessing it

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.560 
the camera a little bit by recessing it
there<00:00:52.050> nothing<00:00:52.800> really<00:00:53.039> holds<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.550> closed<00:00:54.000> so

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
there nothing really holds it closed so

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470 
there nothing really holds it closed so
you<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:55.230> there's<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.850> top<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.000> bottom<00:00:57.270> are

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
you know there's that top and bottom are

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.540 
you know there's that top and bottom are
open<00:00:57.989> right<00:00:58.140> so<00:00:58.739> here's<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.160> display

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
open right so here's how the display

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.240 
open right so here's how the display
works<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.390> got<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> little<00:01:01.140> tiny<00:01:01.410> magnet<00:01:02.129> in

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
works it's got a little tiny magnet in

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.799 
works it's got a little tiny magnet in
it<00:01:02.370> if<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:02.609> see<00:01:02.789> it<00:01:02.910> that<00:01:03.270> little<00:01:03.480> dot<00:01:03.780> there

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it if you see it that little dot there

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.450 
it if you see it that little dot there
in<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.199> middle<00:01:04.379> of<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.500> screen<00:01:04.680> there's<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
in the middle of the screen there's the

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.149 
in the middle of the screen there's the
magnet<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.570> as<00:01:06.869> soon<00:01:07.110> as<00:01:07.229> you<00:01:07.409> close<00:01:07.799> the<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
magnet so as soon as you close the the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:11.090 
magnet so as soon as you close the the
case<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.150> cover<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:10.140> triggers<00:01:10.560> it<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:10.860> then

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
case the cover it triggers it and then

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.980 
case the cover it triggers it and then
we<00:01:11.250> get<00:01:11.400> this<00:01:11.549> little<00:01:11.700> window<00:01:12.030> so<00:01:12.270> obviously

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
we get this little window so obviously

you just keep going you're gonna get
back<00:01:31.200> to<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.380> analog<00:01:33.229> those<00:01:34.229> are<00:01:34.380> kind<00:01:34.619> of
