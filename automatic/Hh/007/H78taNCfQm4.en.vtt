00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.399
 group 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.620
 I practice the scale today 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.060
 The scale is that of the bill bought by the street group 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.030
 I want to introduce 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:18.610
 It is Well um 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.610
 Somewhat that recording device 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.300
 I have something like a recording hourly salary 

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:28.850
 Whether now Toka those of even flow free crowded Aso 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:36.220
 After that ipad 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:41.380
 There is a man-free thing with ipad and so on , and a guitar that I'm driving in with 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:45.290
 Of it 's such would take even Noto had been able to connect with the buy had bis is really that 

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:51.220
 I think that it became familiar, so using that kind of thing 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.220
 I would like to introduce that practice I am doing 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:01:03.500
 Anything is fine, but I think the piano is probably that way or something else Share 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.500
 In that piano 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.090
 Four 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:16.550
 I hit the chord, it's a measure 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:22.400
 I will grumble it without chapter 4 and loop it all over again 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:24.409
 I put three of me in the feeling of being called Fujima base note of the tower brain tower drum that that 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.860
 All the time by loop 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.190
 The rest is over 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:33.630
 I'd have to say and try to fine various moving at scale 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.630
 So hem is really good 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:42.729
 Then I mean to'm glad also that Nankai another extended Haza location 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.729
 It means that the go 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.440
 Why is it also good to remember the place and 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.850
 By doing that after all while listening to the sound 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.890
 Toka Do not you lend and what has been matched to the code 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.580
 I wonder why I understand that 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.420
 By all means 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.490
 Oh is the recommended way 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:12.369
 In the Well song of that person not a that the net is called the b What I do 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.369
 Yes, it's quite easy to do action 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.380
 g rank 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.740
 Hmm 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.740
 Non 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.680
 Ishii 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.420
 I think that I make a loop with the red circle too 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.420
 Heard that if something Hii' 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:45.370
 Well it's that blues- poe and it's a really simple scale exercise and I can go to bed 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.340
 And brother of the bag to flow his brother 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.530
 My own coffee 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.080
 There is a feeling that yeah is fit 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.540
 It is very nice to be able to confirm 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:59.360
 Really something and solo 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:03:01.650
 If you go to those who want to strengthen such a thing is like that 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.409
 I guess it's not good 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.409
 You can really try coffee with the code block 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.720
 Riding Oh 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.510
 A lot of practice of mother vision and 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.180
 1 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.350
 You may try to draw one by one Suma 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.090
 I will make my own idea 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.090
 In it feels it 's Let's also do this yourself 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.240
 I can do it because I can do it 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.940
 A line with so many children tablature and so on 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.650
 Late 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.920
 That and say do unless we do this 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:42.569
 I think there are some hard parts 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.380
 The kana is not it really good because going to break the fine entered in the body from such Toko 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:45.560
 I think 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.590
 If if good that 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:53.740
 If it is in such an environment, that by all means 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:57.260
 Please try it Well software such as iphone 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:04:02.180
 I think it's important 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:05.830
 Because I can really receipt So even Kanamaa in more schools and mouth 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:09.440
 Because me also available it sound so I think at all good 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:11.770
 Please make sure to refer to that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.770
