00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 we want to deal with now 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.000
 a very interesting topic for a 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.889
 German works for Real Madrid and 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.769
 the whole in Germany and the title 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.109
 must read aloud has the director 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:23.609
 madrid foundation clinic beautiful evening 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:27.289
 stefan kohfahl right on the table because 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.359
 I learned that you do something like that 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:31.260
 in spain, above all else, the 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.910
 history has apparently 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.410
 rumgesprochen the story has become 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.190
 rumgesprochen I have no lying 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.770
 map now history must be 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.450
 to clarify briefly 

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.329
 Mr. Kuphal, you are after all 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:48.059
 spain traveled to real madrid and were 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.920
 at mister real madrid an sanchez 10j 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.430
 Sanchez where usually no one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.140
 get there 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.340
 and what's up with the 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 business card lying on the table 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.890
 So I have mine some time ago 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.329
 concept given at real madrid and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.090
 We have got an invitation 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.530
 Asked who receives me and that 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.700
 I was not told I did 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.409
 of course the third fourth level 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:12.090
 expected was less prepared 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.520
 a powerpoint presentation, so to speak 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.090
 and then I stopped 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.400
 Residencia led and the most important 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.900
 German real madrid came together and 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.640
 the first were business cards 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.250
 exchanged and I already in the moment 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.420
 failed because I did not have it 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.860
 whole is still very positive 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.180
 if you are very positive 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.939
 let us develop the story 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.560
 so they are in germany 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.780
 responsible for what exactly is you 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.119
 project why do you work for real 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.770
 madrid So what they do that goes into 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.390
 First line around soccer shoes and 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.149
 clinic screenings is not called here 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.369
 a talk hour hospital and me 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:50.250
 I'm responsible since last year 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.990
 for germany from this morning on 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.340
 was the press conference for switzerland 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.040
 Austria Liechtenstein Luxembourg 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.600
 Netherlands Belgium still a few countries 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.909
 Get more, so that was it 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.409
 not so bad the last year and it 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.149
 is about scouting football 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.280
 school it is about mediation of 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.890
 cultural sporting social values 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.560
 and scort foundation from the action 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.980
 takes place that his foundation and the 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.540
 is carrier of the whole 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.330
 and the foundation has now become straight too 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.030
 excellent for the best social 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.129
 project in sport 2014 when I do it 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 So let's try to get it together 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.580
 real madrid now has a base 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.459
 through them in germany where it comes from 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:28.599
 you have to find talents 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.580
 sometime again in quotation marks 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:32.650
 deliver what real madrid expects from 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.750
 They then want their new ones intimately 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.220
 toni kroos so we have the 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.170
 focus on seven to 14-year-olds 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.120
 So there's a little bit of time left 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.980
 There is also the word mediated 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.860
 long term and long term in football 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.230
 counts normali but here yes and it works 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.209
 But not only the invention of talent with the 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.310
 soccer with real madrid you have access 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.440
 in the children always grad pictures 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.940
 chelsea or from these fans and 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.069
 it represents her present time is it 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.599
 convey important values 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.670
 Football finds a positive approach 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:02.319
 with children you can achieve a lot 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:05.500
 so if you are responsible with it 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.209
 avoid toni kroos you want with 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.359
 embed which role he plays in the 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.819
 history yes the ambassador of us 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.579
 and that also stands for a lot of something real 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.130
 depicting madrid is a fairer 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:19.750
 sportsman that is someone very 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.109
 humble is also the whole 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.220
 history so no no diva and that 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.139
 was because of children also present that 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.590
 Good footballer much more 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:28.480
 his 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.980
 i see real madrid coming here right now 

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.440
 Incidentally, driving up with one 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.959
 dortmunder license plate on schalke 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.959
 so that has something 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.910
 a small pointed direction schalke 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.280
 hermannstädter 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.810
 but again on her conversation what 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.700
 They had there with Mr. Sanchez 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.810
 usually one does not know that 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.030
 You do not see it when you enter 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.380
 conversation with him then means it may 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:00.209
 I quote that no, I may 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.650
 photograph no and if they are from the 

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.239
 space give out after five seconds of 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.640
 Brands any information automatically in the 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.350
 Brain how did you get it? 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.730
 www is the story gone 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:13.470
 yes he was there and first philosophy 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.919
 philosoph did not study business administration 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.840
 or something else and vision and that 

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:21.090
 as a vision has also seen his 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:24.900
 own part contributed to what we did 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.540
 just implement and is someone of the matter 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:28.740
 understands and then other projects 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:31.470
 a long way because he again that 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.350
 next project makes like eg stadium construction 

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.700
 or real madrid has its own 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.620
 University is currently building its own 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.169
 district are quite a lot of projects 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:42.900
 real madrid does that too all josé 

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:44.700
 Angel Sanchez is responsible and I am 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.850
 just a small part of it and look forward 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.490
 to have this position on the 

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.060
 to be close to children and real madrid too 

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.940
 represent 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:57.330
 now they were in the past too 

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:58.860
 Germany works for German wines like 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.990
 have you come up with the idea? 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.280
 to develop a concept for foreigners 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.510
 clubs then cleaned their latches 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.760
 and above all things like that 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.080
 financially by the way, toni kroos can 

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.240
 her ambassador is on the hook 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:14.460
 arrives and then they have everything on red 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:16.800
 set and it came out bright red yes it 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.380
 so the concept i am since 36 

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.460
 years trainer and then have 50 years 

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:26.070
 football schools segment worked off 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:29.789
 study sports and then you make yourself 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:32.130
 also thoughts about football and the 

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:33.900
 Football here very regional that is called the 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.610
 hamburger sv could be less one now 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.729
 school in bavaria and bayer would have 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.380
 Difficulties in hamburg and madrid 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:41.940
 is already supraregional so far it does 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:43.890
 to come from outside 

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.920
 to be the first foreign club 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:46.650
 who does what 

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.990
 third, by a special address 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.540
 that makes sense in particular and the 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.150
 Children come open mouth to the clinic 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:57.400
 to and how can that also represent what 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:00.670
 we also spread with maria madrid 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.510
 What kind of role does it play for 

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:03.460
 your work 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:04.870
 real madrid said okay we take 

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:06.630
 you and we take Germany especially 

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:08.800
 as Germany has become world champion 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.210
 luckily I had the contract already 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:12.420
 So before singing not quite each other 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.730
 that was in november 13 

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.080
 and that was then beneficial effect of 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:19.330
 sportive moment of real madrid 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.110
 Champions league winners in the land of 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:21.850
 world champion 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.230
 that has the whole project of course 

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:25.260
 pushed on I think we had 

00:06:23.230 --> 00:06:27.820
 now over 1000 newspaper articles with us 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:30.070
 and the whole game with 1 and real 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:32.010
 madrid is really proud of what's here 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:35.290
 There is such a big thing happening 

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:37.060
 World map in the museum and you can there 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:38.770
 always see which country on the 

00:06:37.060 --> 00:06:41.740
 social media on the web page 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:44.320
 accesses and there shines Germany 

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:45.100
 Thank you very much 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:47.590
 for the insights 

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:49.420
 They were in the team hotel they go 

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:50.340
 of it all at madrid against schalke 

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.090
 We can do it easily 

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:53.950
 I believe it a certain 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.260
 tension there is real madrid 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.240
 loses reluctance 

00:06:55.260 --> 00:07:01.170
 and they have to prove themselves today and 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.590
 It will never be like a walk 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:07.000
 last year 

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:09.340
 and in that sense, I believe a result 

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:10.510
 you too satisfied when it's over for 

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:14.190
 real madrid goes out 

00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:14.190
 We hope for a result said Krupp 

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:20.520
 after the job together 

00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.410
 to look fully and we had said yes 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.980
 as soon as the Schalke exhibition 

00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:24.980
 come out
