Peter Griffin I think Seth MacFarlane
has<00:02:34.500> ruined<00:02:34.799> the<00:02:35.189> Massachusetts<00:02:35.970> Boston<00:02:36.209> area

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.869 
accent forever uh and Tom Hanks you know
I<00:02:40.440> think<00:02:40.530> also<00:02:40.980> the<00:02:41.250> other<00:02:41.370> problem<00:02:41.700> I<00:02:41.760> have

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
I think also the other problem I have

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.610 
I think also the other problem I have
Nellie<00:02:42.060> do<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.239> only<00:02:42.390> care<00:02:42.599> Peter<00:02:42.840> Griffin<00:02:43.200> but

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
Nellie do I only care Peter Griffin but

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.080 
Nellie do I only care Peter Griffin but
it<00:02:43.709> kind<00:02:43.860> of<00:02:43.890> goes<00:02:44.010> in<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:44.430> out<00:02:44.519> and<00:02:44.579> I<00:02:44.940> think

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
it kind of goes in and out and I think

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.640 
it kind of goes in and out and I think
maybe<00:02:45.209> Tom<00:02:45.450> Hanks<00:02:45.720> himself<00:02:46.049> was<00:02:46.230> wrestling

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
maybe Tom Hanks himself was wrestling

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:48.759 
maybe Tom Hanks himself was wrestling
with<00:02:46.769> how<00:02:46.890> heavy-handed<00:02:47.579> should<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.180> be<00:02:48.390> here

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
and so that that was kind of something

it's gonna be narrative ly compelling I
guess<00:03:22.620> that's<00:03:22.859> on<00:03:23.099> the<00:03:23.280> filmmakers<00:03:23.819> to<00:03:24.030> make

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
guess that's on the filmmakers to make

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.170 
guess that's on the filmmakers to make
that<00:03:24.329> happen<00:03:24.480> I<00:03:24.949> didn't<00:03:25.949> think<00:03:26.099> that<00:03:26.250> 127

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
that happen I didn't think that 127

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.390 
that happen I didn't think that 127
hours<00:03:27.269> succeeded<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.889> I<00:03:29.099> would<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.370> to

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
hours succeeded and I would like to

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.830 
hours succeeded and I would like to
clarify<00:03:29.639> and<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.359> where<00:03:30.510> you<00:03:30.720> know<00:03:30.810> I

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
clarify and this is where you know I

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.470 
clarify and this is where you know I
think<00:03:31.049> this<00:03:31.739> is<00:03:31.889> the<00:03:32.040> gray<00:03:32.220> area<00:03:32.699> where<00:03:33.000> when<00:03:33.449> I

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
think this is the gray area where when I

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.000 
think this is the gray area where when I
reviewed<00:03:33.840> that<00:03:33.959> movie<00:03:34.260> we<00:03:34.349> get<00:03:34.440> a<00:03:34.470> crew<00:03:34.680> review

can you not love hundred 27 hours what

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:41.509 
can you not love hundred 27 hours what

this man did was amazing and it's like
know<00:03:41.819> what<00:03:42.359> the<00:03:42.510> guy<00:03:43.169> in<00:03:43.349> 127<00:03:43.919> hours<00:03:44.220> went

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
know what the guy in 127 hours went

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.640 
know what the guy in 127 hours went
through<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.910> what<00:03:45.000> he<00:03:45.090> had<00:03:45.209> to<00:03:45.329> do<00:03:45.510> is<00:03:45.780> amazing

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
through and what he had to do is amazing

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.619 
through and what he had to do is amazing
and<00:03:46.829> just<00:03:47.400> because<00:03:47.669> the<00:03:47.790> movie<00:03:48.090> of<00:03:48.209> one<00:03:48.389> of

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
and just because the movie of one of

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:50.449 
and just because the movie of one of
that<00:03:48.810> incident<00:03:49.319> didn't<00:03:49.620> work<00:03:49.799> out<00:03:49.949> she<00:03:50.340> can

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
that incident didn't work out she can

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.849 
that incident didn't work out she can
take<00:03:50.730> away<00:03:50.970> from<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.269> real-life<00:03:51.720> drama<00:03:52.500> and

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
take away from the real-life drama and

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:55.159 
take away from the real-life drama and
heroics<00:03:53.340> so<00:03:54.269> I<00:03:54.299> think<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.750> important<00:03:55.139> that

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
heroics so I think it's important that

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:56.930 
heroics so I think it's important that
we<00:03:55.290> separate<00:03:55.709> these<00:03:55.889> two<00:03:56.129> and<00:03:56.310> we're<00:03:56.459> talking

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
we separate these two and we're talking

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:58.309 
we separate these two and we're talking
about<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.299> film<00:03:57.540> because<00:03:57.870> you<00:03:57.989> know<00:03:58.079> it<00:03:58.199> is<00:03:58.230> a

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
about the film because you know it is a

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.789 
about the film because you know it is a
piece<00:03:58.560> of<00:03:58.709> art<00:03:58.919> and<00:04:00.139> sometimes<00:04:01.139> sometimes<00:04:01.530> it

00:04:01.789 --> 00:04:01.799 
piece of art and sometimes sometimes it

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:03.890 
piece of art and sometimes sometimes it
doesn't<00:04:01.919> work<00:04:02.120> but<00:04:03.120> I'll<00:04:03.269> see<00:04:03.480> this<00:04:03.599> because

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
doesn't work but I'll see this because

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.089 
doesn't work but I'll see this because
you<00:04:03.989> know<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.199> produced<00:04:04.470> by<00:04:04.500> Scott<00:04:04.799> Rudin

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:05.099 
you know it's produced by Scott Rudin

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.909 
you know it's produced by Scott Rudin
Paul<00:04:05.340> Greengrass<00:04:05.639> is<00:04:06.299> directing<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.680> Tom

Hanks<00:04:08.190> is<00:04:08.310> starring<00:04:08.699> and<00:04:08.819> I<00:04:08.849> think<00:04:09.060> more<00:04:09.540> often

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
Hanks is starring and I think more often

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:11.270 
Hanks is starring and I think more often
than<00:04:10.049> not<00:04:10.079> I<00:04:10.440> mean<00:04:10.530> all<00:04:10.739> those<00:04:10.889> people<00:04:10.949> have

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
than not I mean all those people have

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.740 
than not I mean all those people have
had<00:04:11.400> misfires<00:04:11.849> but<00:04:12.120> more<00:04:12.269> often<00:04:12.569> than<00:04:12.720> not

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
had misfires but more often than not

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.219 
had misfires but more often than not
they<00:04:13.019> know<00:04:13.139> what<00:04:13.290> they're<00:04:13.409> doing<00:04:13.739> so<00:04:14.340> I<00:04:15.229> think

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
they know what they're doing so I think

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.810 
they know what they're doing so I think
this<00:04:16.500> is<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.799> some<00:04:16.949> interest<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.400> me

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
this is of some interest to me

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:19.490 
this is of some interest to me
to<00:04:18.000> say<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.389> actually<00:04:18.630> also<00:04:19.049> reminds<00:04:19.349> me<00:04:19.440> a

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
to say I actually also reminds me a

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.250 
to say I actually also reminds me a
little<00:04:19.620> bit<00:04:19.709> of<00:04:19.829> flight<00:04:20.099> you<00:04:20.639> know<00:04:20.760> a<00:04:21.260> captain

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
little bit of flight you know a captain

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.990 
little bit of flight you know a captain
of<00:04:22.349> something<00:04:22.770> and<00:04:22.979> a<00:04:23.039> harrowing<00:04:23.490> situation

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
of something and a harrowing situation

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000 
of something and a harrowing situation
having<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:24.210> overcome<00:04:24.479> it<00:04:24.750> so<00:04:24.930> we'll<00:04:25.620> see

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
having to overcome it so we'll see

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.670 
having to overcome it so we'll see
I'm<00:04:26.639> not<00:04:26.909> hugely<00:04:27.630> excited<00:04:28.080> about<00:04:28.289> it<00:04:28.500> it's

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
I'm not hugely excited about it it's

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.350 
I'm not hugely excited about it it's
something<00:04:28.979> if<00:04:29.130> it<00:04:29.310> gets<00:04:29.460> a<00:04:29.550> lot<00:04:29.669> of<00:04:29.789> Oscar<00:04:29.969> buzz

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
something if it gets a lot of Oscar buzz

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.659 
something if it gets a lot of Oscar buzz
I<00:04:30.539> maybe<00:04:30.780> would<00:04:30.990> see<00:04:31.169> it<00:04:31.260> in<00:04:31.349> theaters<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:32.219> so

00:04:32.659 --> 00:04:32.669 
I maybe would see it in theaters but so

00:04:32.669 --> 00:04:32.950 
I maybe would see it in theaters but so

think you know some people are saying
they<00:04:38.389> feel<00:04:38.539> this<00:04:38.690> is<00:04:38.840> kind<00:04:39.050> of<00:04:39.169> racist<00:04:39.590> because

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:39.830 
they feel this is kind of racist because

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:42.249 
they feel this is kind of racist because
you<00:04:40.130> know<00:04:40.220> you<00:04:40.280> have<00:04:40.690> mostly<00:04:41.690> a<00:04:41.780> white<00:04:41.990> crew

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:42.259 
you know you have mostly a white crew

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.029 
you know you have mostly a white crew
against<00:04:42.740> uh<00:04:42.889> you<00:04:43.460> know<00:04:43.580> Somali<00:04:43.940> black<00:04:44.330> pirates

00:04:45.029 --> 00:04:45.039 
against uh you know Somali black pirates

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.800 
against uh you know Somali black pirates
that's<00:04:46.039> what<00:04:46.280> happened<00:04:46.669> I'm<00:04:46.910> guessing<00:04:47.509> so<00:04:47.780> I

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
that's what happened I'm guessing so I

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.749 
that's what happened I'm guessing so I
don't<00:04:48.080> know<00:04:48.169> how<00:04:48.289> that<00:04:48.710> can<00:04:48.830> be<00:04:48.889> I<00:04:49.250> don't

00:04:49.749 --> 00:04:49.759 
don't know how that can be I don't

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:51.370 
don't know how that can be I don't
really<00:04:49.880> think<00:04:49.970> that's<00:04:50.270> racist<00:04:51.169> from<00:04:51.259> the

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:51.380 
really think that's racist from the

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.680 
really think that's racist from the
intent<00:04:51.650> of<00:04:51.740> the<00:04:51.860> filmmakers<00:04:52.400> it's<00:04:53.360> an<00:04:53.509> it's

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:53.690 
intent of the filmmakers it's an it's

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:55.210 
intent of the filmmakers it's an it's
unfortunate<00:04:54.289> nobody<00:04:54.590> likes<00:04:54.770> to<00:04:54.860> see<00:04:55.039> these
