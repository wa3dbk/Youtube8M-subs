I'm not ready to die yet plus500 space
points<00:01:57.030> yeah<00:01:57.210> yeah<00:01:57.840> yes<00:01:58.290> base<00:01:58.590> points<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.219> you

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
points yeah yeah yes base points and you

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.050 
points yeah yeah yes base points and you
can<00:01:59.610> use<00:01:59.790> your<00:01:59.969> space<00:02:00.180> points<00:02:00.799> basically<00:02:02.060> i'll

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
can use your space points basically i'll

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.429 
can use your space points basically i'll
show<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.360> a<00:02:03.420> little<00:02:03.570> bit<00:02:03.659> later<00:02:03.930> on<00:02:04.020> but<00:02:04.170> you

show you a little bit later on but you
can<00:02:04.560> use<00:02:04.770> those<00:02:05.009> to<00:02:05.340> upgrade<00:02:05.850> your<00:02:06.060> astronaut

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
and here we're exploring we got some

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.140 
and here we're exploring we got some
resources<00:02:10.619> just<00:02:10.979> from<00:02:11.160> exploring<00:02:11.520> that<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
resources just from exploring that and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.370 
resources just from exploring that and
other<00:02:12.510> times

pilot<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.350> little<00:03:19.650> bit<00:03:19.770> before<00:03:19.980> i<00:03:20.190> can<00:03:20.400> get<00:03:20.580> to

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
pilot a little bit before i can get to

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.630 
pilot a little bit before i can get to
actually<00:03:21.150> using<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.020> but<00:03:22.200> i<00:03:22.260> can<00:03:22.500> use<00:03:22.740> it<00:03:22.920> to

actually using that but i can use it to

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.880 
actually using that but i can use it to
slow<00:03:23.880> myself<00:03:24.060> down<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.450> not<00:03:24.720> get<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.830> know

scenario<00:03:41.850> there<00:03:42.000> are<00:03:42.090> three<00:03:42.300> scenarios<00:03:42.570> in

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
scenario there are three scenarios in

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:45.199 
scenario there are three scenarios in
the<00:03:42.990> game<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:44.430> this<00:03:44.670> is<00:03:44.760> stirred<00:03:44.910> the<00:03:45.030> first

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
the game and this is stirred the first

the game and this is stirred the first
one<00:03:45.390> this<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.660> beginner<00:03:46.340> scenario<00:03:47.340> so

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
one this is the beginner scenario so

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.460 
one this is the beginner scenario so

scenario<00:04:06.090> I<00:04:06.950> wonder<00:04:07.950> can<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:08.490> kind<00:04:08.820> of<00:04:08.850> use

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
scenario I wonder can you kind of use

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:10.850 
scenario I wonder can you kind of use
the<00:04:09.060> gravity<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.110> stations<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.830> the

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
the gravity of the stations and the

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.650 
the gravity of the stations and the
planets<00:04:11.250> to<00:04:11.370> kind<00:04:11.520> of<00:04:11.580> slingshot<00:04:11.940> you<00:04:12.390> sure

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
planets to kind of slingshot you sure

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:14.930 
planets to kind of slingshot you sure
can<00:04:12.959> I<00:04:13.200> wonder<00:04:13.440> yeah<00:04:13.860> absolutely<00:04:14.100> even<00:04:14.820> it's

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
can I wonder yeah absolutely even it's

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.150 
can I wonder yeah absolutely even it's
like<00:04:15.150> it<00:04:15.300> more<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:16.230> can<00:04:16.380> use<00:04:16.530> it<00:04:16.560> to<00:04:16.830> sort<00:04:17.040> of

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
like it more you can use it to sort of

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.160 
like it more you can use it to sort of
pull<00:04:17.489> yourself<00:04:17.880> in<00:04:18.090> and<00:04:18.299> then<00:04:18.390> try<00:04:18.600> to<00:04:18.630> oh<00:04:18.840> and

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
pull yourself in and then try to oh and

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.990 
pull yourself in and then try to oh and
there's<00:04:19.380> something<00:04:19.650> cool<00:04:19.830> here<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.850> can<00:04:20.970> use

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
there's something cool here you can use

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.700 
there's something cool here you can use
it<00:04:21.120> to<00:04:21.270> pull<00:04:21.419> yourself<00:04:21.540> in<00:04:21.930> and<00:04:22.350> then<00:04:22.500> also

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it to pull yourself in and then also

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.560 
it to pull yourself in and then also
sort<00:04:23.130> of<00:04:23.190> escape<00:04:23.580> with<00:04:23.790> with<00:04:24.090> a<00:04:24.120> little<00:04:24.360> burn

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
so here we go it's a moon lander get a

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.430 
so here we go it's a moon lander get a
little<00:04:28.490> text<00:04:28.940> definitely<00:04:29.900> got<00:04:30.020> some<00:04:30.139> of<00:04:30.229> space

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
little text definitely got some of space

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.770 
little text definitely got some of space
points<00:04:30.830> and<00:04:30.949> resources<00:04:31.520> and<00:04:31.850> it's<00:04:32.419> an<00:04:32.540> ancient

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:32.780 
points and resources and it's an ancient

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.580 
points and resources and it's an ancient
earth<00:04:33.560> moon<00:04:34.310> lander<00:04:34.789> so<00:04:35.389> that's<00:04:35.630> nice<00:04:35.780> it's

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
earth moon lander so that's nice it's
