00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:07.709
 What's up friends from youtube this time? 

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:11.180
 encounter on the route of 706 with very 3.0 

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:14.370
 Android version 4.4 points 2 kitkat 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:17.090
 how can you see this rom is pretty 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.900
 pretty the truth 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.880
 here I come to bring you the solution 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:24.250
 for some problems that this has 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.010
 room 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.760
 an example is that I have my liking 

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:33.220
 have nova launcher by default and then 

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.980
 if it opens me and everything but at the moment of 

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.980
 return is not in the launcher 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.250
 I come to the room by default to the 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:49.370
 very and well the truth is I do not like to have 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.379
 all my icons here piled up 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.370
 and then another problem is that of 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.770
 browser 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.910
 I want to watch videos and well 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.900
 the option to choose the youtube appears 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.920
 I have it installed 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.110
 there will still be some pages 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 and this browser opens automatically 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.229
 by default and well I like to use 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.229
 a lot of chroma 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.140
 this brings you a small solution 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.850
 we have to be root users as you see 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:27.990
 here I am root user I will leave you 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.200
 the link so you can see how to root this 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.200
 room 

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:37.500
 once they have already surrounded we are going to 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:42.350
 need link two sd 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.350
 we are going to look for and we are going to look for 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.569
 how are they going to see in each person 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.620
 until it freezes and we're going to freeze 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.890
 the Navigator 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:01.110
 personally let's say to the regulations and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.240
 I like that the chrome sometimes the 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.380
 operates mini and that's why it's going to give us 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:13.310
 the option of being able to choose the three grams 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.310
 well isolated let's look for the start 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.950
 before freezing the start clear they should 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:22.319
 have a launcher installed 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.170
 to disappear by default nothing happened 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.390
 because he in the same good me right now 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.970
 I froze it and then nothing will happen to it 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.920
 My cell phone has already been tested by 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:35.050
 that's what I do this little video only 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.510
 now at the moment of giving 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:43.230
 now it's going 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:46.019
 to answer in the woman that I wanted 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.420
 and the time of again there is staying 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.640
 well this is the small solution that 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.190
 I was hoping you liked this 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.620
 video subscribe if I will be uploading 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.489
 videos very often I have some other 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.300
 very interesting videos so that 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.500
 check 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.500
 see you later bye
