tiny click Edit tiny mix here are some
pentatonic<00:00:11.340> licks<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.910> are<00:00:12.599> two<00:00:12.870> notes<00:00:13.049> per

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
pentatonic licks that are two notes per

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.870 
pentatonic licks that are two notes per
string<00:00:14.150> but<00:00:15.150> they're<00:00:15.269> still<00:00:15.389> fast<00:00:16.820> this<00:00:17.820> is

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
string but they're still fast this is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.320 
string but they're still fast this is
sort<00:00:18.180> of<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.300> sixteenth<00:00:18.750> note<00:00:19.050> feel<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.039> a<00:00:20.699> minor

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
sort of a sixteenth note feel in a minor

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.630 
sort of a sixteenth note feel in a minor
pentatonic<00:00:21.630> and<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:23.039> sounds<00:00:23.340> something<00:00:23.490> like

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
pentatonic and it sounds something like

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:34.720 
pentatonic and it sounds something like
this<00:00:24.000> maybe<00:00:24.390> we<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.660> get<00:00:24.750> through<00:00:24.960> it<00:00:32.300> and

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
this maybe we can get through it and

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:38.360 
this maybe we can get through it and
basal<00:00:35.730> i'm<00:00:35.850> doing<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.680> this<00:00:37.680> kind<00:00:37.950> of<00:00:38.040> pattern

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
basal i'm doing is this kind of pattern

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.220 
basal i'm doing is this kind of pattern
where<00:00:40.610> got<00:00:41.610> an<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:41.879> note<00:00:42.120> on<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.629> D<00:00:42.750> string<00:00:42.780> and

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
where got an a note on the D string and

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.680 
where got an a note on the D string and
I<00:00:43.980> descend<00:00:44.520> three<00:00:44.910> notes<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.390> a<00:00:45.480> minor

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
I descend three notes in a minor

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.459 
I descend three notes in a minor
pentatonic<00:00:47.450> that<00:00:48.450> kind<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.629> thing<00:00:48.840> using<00:00:49.410> a

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
pentatonic that kind of thing using a

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.760 
pentatonic that kind of thing using a
pull-off<00:00:50.420> to<00:00:51.420> make<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> easier<00:00:52.469> to<00:00:52.590> pick

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
pull-off to make it easier to pick

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.200 
pull-off to make it easier to pick
basically<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.989> then<00:00:54.989> I<00:00:55.079> uh<00:00:55.110> send<00:00:56.059> backup<00:00:57.059> to

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
basically and then I uh send backup to

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.020 
basically and then I uh send backup to
the<00:00:57.390> original<00:00:57.690> note<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.399> look<00:00:59.399> at<00:00:59.550> the<00:00:59.609> cenote

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the original note and look at the cenote

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
the original note and look at the cenote
and<00:01:00.239> back<00:01:00.390> down<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.590> way<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.770> sort<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.160> look

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
and back down so the way I sort of look

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.160 
and back down so the way I sort of look
at<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.489> is<00:01:02.670> these<00:01:03.030> two<00:01:03.239> things<00:01:03.480> this<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
at it is these two things this is the

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.700 
at it is these two things this is the
first<00:01:04.379> part<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.060> second<00:01:06.299> part

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:06.710 
first part and this is the second part

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.530 
first part and this is the second part
so<00:01:07.710> it's<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.070> GE<00:01:09.229> think<00:01:10.229> about<00:01:10.409> them<00:01:10.560> notes<00:01:10.799> and

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
so it's a GE think about them notes and

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
so it's a GE think about them notes and
gac<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> the<00:01:14.189> two<00:01:14.340> parts<00:01:14.580> together

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.410 

that's<00:01:21.310> the<00:01:21.490> main<00:01:21.759> sort<00:01:22.090> of<00:01:22.149> meat<00:01:22.329> and

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:22.420 
that's the main sort of meat and

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.730 
that's the main sort of meat and
potatoes<00:01:22.840> in<00:01:22.990> fact<00:01:23.170> that'll<00:01:23.350> give<00:01:23.439> you<00:01:23.530> a<00:01:23.560> real

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
potatoes in fact that'll give you a real

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:32.850 
potatoes in fact that'll give you a real
good<00:01:23.890> kind<00:01:24.159> of<00:01:24.220> triplet<00:01:24.579> like<00:01:26.220> slower

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.990 

and<00:01:33.860> then<00:01:34.189> all<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.369> did<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.670> make<00:01:34.850> it<00:01:34.939> a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
and then all I did to make it a

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.969 
and then all I did to make it a
sixteenth<00:01:35.450> note<00:01:35.630> fields<00:01:35.990> add<00:01:36.140> two<00:01:36.439> more<00:01:36.740> notes

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
sixteenth note fields add two more notes

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:38.050 
sixteenth note fields add two more notes
on<00:01:37.100> the<00:01:37.189> end<00:01:37.340> that<00:01:37.520> we've<00:01:37.640> already<00:01:37.759> played<00:01:38.000> a

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
on the end that we've already played a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.249 
on the end that we've already played a
million<00:01:38.360> times<00:01:38.509> so<00:01:38.719> it<00:01:38.780> should<00:01:38.930> be<00:01:38.960> too<00:01:39.170> much

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:39.259 
million times so it should be too much

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.149 
million times so it should be too much
trouble<00:01:40.270> and<00:01:41.270> then<00:01:41.420> I<00:01:41.450> added<00:01:41.630> on<00:01:41.810> a<00:01:41.840> and<00:01:42.200> G<00:01:42.380> just

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:43.159 
trouble and then I added on a and G just

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.249 
trouble and then I added on a and G just
descending<00:01:43.880> again<00:01:44.119> on<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.299> same<00:01:44.509> scale<00:01:44.810> so

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
descending again on the same scale so

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:46.690 
descending again on the same scale so
repeating<00:01:45.679> a<00:01:45.710> lot<00:01:45.829> of<00:01:45.950> notes<00:01:46.130> but<00:01:46.399> ends<00:01:46.640> up

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
repeating a lot of notes but ends up

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.690 
repeating a lot of notes but ends up
sounding<00:01:46.850> cool<00:01:48.429> that's<00:01:49.429> the<00:01:49.579> whole<00:01:49.610> leg<00:01:54.700> just

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
sounding cool that's the whole leg just

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.160 
sounding cool that's the whole leg just
that<00:01:55.939> cycled<00:01:56.509> over<00:01:56.569> and<00:01:56.750> over<00:01:56.810> will<00:01:56.990> sound

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.170 
that cycled over and over will sound

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:03.179 
that cycled over and over will sound
pretty<00:01:57.319> cool

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.109 

check<00:02:04.189> out<00:02:04.280> the<00:02:04.340> accents<00:02:04.759> that's<00:02:04.909> real

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
check out the accents that's real

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.889 
check out the accents that's real
important<00:02:05.509> thing<00:02:06.789> all<00:02:07.789> I<00:02:07.850> did<00:02:08.090> was<00:02:08.239> put<00:02:08.690> that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
important thing all I did was put that

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.990 
important thing all I did was put that
on<00:02:09.140> each<00:02:09.410> set<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:10.009> three<00:02:10.489> strings<00:02:10.819> in<00:02:10.940> the

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
on each set of three strings in the

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.309 
on each set of three strings in the
pentatonic<00:02:11.269> scale<00:02:11.630> so<00:02:11.780> it<00:02:11.840> stood<00:02:11.989> the<00:02:12.110> first

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
pentatonic scale so it stood the first

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:14.620 
pentatonic scale so it stood the first
one<00:02:12.500> maybe<00:02:12.680> on<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.920> a<00:02:12.950> string<00:02:13.130> and<00:02:14.090> do<00:02:14.480> that

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
one maybe on the a string and do that

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.270 
one maybe on the a string and do that
pattern

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.560 

on<00:02:20.280> those<00:02:20.460> three<00:02:20.700> strings<00:02:20.970> keeping<00:02:21.390> within

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
on those three strings keeping within

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:24.050 
on those three strings keeping within
the<00:02:21.720> shape<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.170> a<00:02:22.290> minor<00:02:22.500> pentatonic<00:02:22.770> then<00:02:23.550> do

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
the shape of a minor pentatonic then do

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.650 
the shape of a minor pentatonic then do
the<00:02:24.150> one<00:02:24.300> based<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.780> D<00:02:24.960> string<00:02:26.300> is<00:02:27.300> when<00:02:27.600> we

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
the one based on the D string is when we

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.410 
the one based on the D string is when we
started<00:02:28.020> them<00:02:28.110> then<00:02:28.820> do<00:02:29.820> one<00:02:30.000> on<00:02:30.120> the<00:02:30.240> g<00:02:30.390> string

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
started them then do one on the g string

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.030 
started them then do one on the g string
which<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.750> happens<00:02:30.930> to<00:02:30.990> be<00:02:31.080> the<00:02:31.170> Dino<00:02:34.040> some

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
which it happens to be the Dino some

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.490 
which it happens to be the Dino some
kind<00:02:35.190> of<00:02:35.220> pairing<00:02:35.460> a<00:02:35.490> little<00:02:35.640> bit<00:02:35.730> slower

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:38.500 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:41.470 

and<00:02:39.500> some<00:02:40.400> kind<00:02:40.550> of<00:02:40.580> thing<00:02:40.760> based<00:02:41.030> off<00:02:41.209> the<00:02:41.300> B

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
and some kind of thing based off the B
