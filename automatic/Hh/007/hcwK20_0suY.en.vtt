00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
jumps I'm talking about jumps just like

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.510

large ninja jumps just as long as they
are<00:01:17.700> higher<00:01:18.090> than<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.840> regular<00:01:19.020> jumps<00:01:19.470> that

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
are higher than the regular jumps that

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.700 
are higher than the regular jumps that
we<00:01:20.009> have<00:01:20.189> no<00:01:20.430> storm<00:01:20.700> series<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.270> far<00:01:21.380> so<00:01:22.380> the

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
we have no storm series so far so the

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
we have no storm series so far so the

let's have a look on the first example

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:43.720 
let's have a look on the first example
here<00:01:42.560> we<00:01:42.680> get<00:01:42.830> knocked<00:01:43.040> down<00:01:43.130> on<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.550> ground

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.680 
then quickly roll / backflip into a high
jump<00:01:51.470> the<00:01:52.370> speed<00:01:52.640> of<00:01:52.760> this<00:01:52.910> should<00:01:53.300> be<00:01:53.450> on<00:01:53.600> the

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
jump the speed of this should be on the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:55.990 
jump the speed of this should be on the
level<00:01:53.870> as<00:01:54.140> a<00:01:54.200> chakra<00:01:54.950> a<00:01:54.980> dash<00:01:55.280> just<00:01:55.790> so<00:01:55.940> you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
level as a chakra a dash just so you

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.150 
level as a chakra a dash just so you
have<00:01:56.210> something<00:01:56.450> to<00:01:56.630> compare<00:01:57.080> to<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.560> I<00:01:58.040> think

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:58.160 
have something to compare to and I think

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.190 
have something to compare to and I think
it's<00:01:58.550> important<00:01:59.090> that<00:01:59.300> it<00:01:59.480> has<00:01:59.660> that

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:00.200 
it's important that it has that

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.320 
it's important that it has that
particular<00:02:00.890> speed<00:02:01.130> level<00:02:01.430> which<00:02:01.910> is<00:02:01.940> what<00:02:02.300> I

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.330 
particular speed level which is what I

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.610 
particular speed level which is what I
would<00:02:02.480> get<00:02:02.720> into<00:02:02.870> in<00:02:03.320> a<00:02:03.380> moment<00:02:04.990> okay<00:02:05.990> so<00:02:06.380> here

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620 
would get into in a moment okay so here

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:08.350 
would get into in a moment okay so here
you<00:02:06.770> see<00:02:06.830> it<00:02:07.130> in<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.340> more<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.760> game<00:02:08.030> perspective

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
you see it in a more in game perspective

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.930 
you see it in a more in game perspective
you<00:02:09.260> roll<00:02:09.470> back<00:02:09.500> into<00:02:09.890> a<00:02:10.010> backflip<00:02:10.429> and<00:02:10.640> from

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
you roll back into a backflip and from

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.700 
you roll back into a backflip and from
there<00:02:11.180> you<00:02:11.210> perform<00:02:11.780> a<00:02:11.930> high<00:02:12.110> jump<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.590> get

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:12.710 
there you perform a high jump to get

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.310 
there you perform a high jump to get
high<00:02:12.920> up<00:02:13.130> in<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.340> air<00:02:13.630> this<00:02:14.630> particular<00:02:14.960> move

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
high up in the air this particular move

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.080 
high up in the air this particular move
is<00:02:15.530> not<00:02:15.680> bounded<00:02:16.100> to<00:02:16.160> only<00:02:16.460> go<00:02:16.700> directly

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
is not bounded to only go directly

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.730 
is not bounded to only go directly
backwards<00:02:17.300> so<00:02:17.780> I<00:02:17.810> imagine<00:02:18.290> it<00:02:18.590> being

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:18.740 
backwards so I imagine it being

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:20.620 
backwards so I imagine it being
something<00:02:19.100> where<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.610> can<00:02:19.730> backflip<00:02:20.180> to<00:02:20.480> the

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
something where it can backflip to the

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:28.780 
something where it can backflip to the
sides<00:02:20.870> as<00:02:21.110> well<00:02:26.800> anyway<00:02:27.800> I<00:02:27.830> also<00:02:28.220> see<00:02:28.520> this

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
sides as well anyway I also see this

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.400 
sides as well anyway I also see this
happening<00:02:29.210> from<00:02:29.480> the<00:02:29.660> regular<00:02:29.810> rolling

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
happening from the regular rolling

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.410 
happening from the regular rolling
movement<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:31.580> doesn't<00:02:31.880> have<00:02:31.970> to<00:02:32.030> have<00:02:32.390> a

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
movement it doesn't have to have a

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.140 
movement it doesn't have to have a
specific<00:02:32.840> backflip<00:02:33.560> animation<00:02:34.070> so<00:02:34.760> as<00:02:34.970> you

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
specific backflip animation so as you

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.150 
specific backflip animation so as you
can<00:02:35.270> see<00:02:35.540> commencing<00:02:36.290> these<00:02:36.470> high<00:02:36.740> jumps

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
can see commencing these high jumps

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.070 
can see commencing these high jumps
could<00:02:37.520> also<00:02:37.700> happen<00:02:38.090> from<00:02:38.510> the<00:02:38.720> rolling

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
could also happen from the rolling

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.840 
could also happen from the rolling
movement<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:42.830> means<00:02:43.070> that<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.550> can<00:02:43.580> happen

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
movement this means that it can happen

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:51.420 
movement this means that it can happen
going<00:02:44.570> backwards

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.550 

and<00:02:51.519> it<00:02:52.329> can<00:02:52.480> also<00:02:52.629> happen<00:02:52.930> if<00:02:53.260> you're<00:02:53.349> going

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and it can also happen if you're going

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:03.509 
and it can also happen if you're going
forwards<00:02:54.099> towards<00:02:54.310> the<00:02:54.670> opponent<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:03.069> option

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
forwards towards the opponent the option

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.429 
forwards towards the opponent the option
to<00:03:03.640> as<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.180> mentioned<00:03:04.599> earlier<00:03:04.719> is<00:03:05.140> about

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
to as I mentioned earlier is about

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.110 
to as I mentioned earlier is about
leading<00:03:05.950> those<00:03:06.280> movements<00:03:06.700> into

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
leading those movements into

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.069 
leading those movements into
counter-attacks<00:03:08.109> I<00:03:09.569> see<00:03:10.569> this<00:03:10.780> as<00:03:11.019> something

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
counter-attacks I see this as something

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.679 
counter-attacks I see this as something
very<00:03:11.590> interesting<00:03:12.040> because<00:03:12.519> it's<00:03:13.150> an<00:03:13.269> element

00:03:13.679 --> 00:03:13.689 
very interesting because it's an element

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:15.420 
very interesting because it's an element
where<00:03:13.989> you<00:03:14.290> look<00:03:14.530> as<00:03:14.680> if<00:03:14.859> you're<00:03:15.099> about<00:03:15.159> to

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
where you look as if you're about to

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.759 
where you look as if you're about to
treat<00:03:15.939> or<00:03:16.120> at<00:03:16.689> least<00:03:16.900> create<00:03:17.349> some<00:03:17.560> distance

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:17.769 
treat or at least create some distance

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.800 
treat or at least create some distance
but<00:03:18.730> then<00:03:18.849> all<00:03:19.030> of<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.239> sudden<00:03:19.510> you<00:03:19.629> come

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:19.810 
but then all of a sudden you come

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:21.479 
but then all of a sudden you come
straight<00:03:20.139> back<00:03:20.170> at<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.709> opponent<00:03:21.159> to

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:21.489 
straight back at the opponent to

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:30.330 
straight back at the opponent to
counter-attack<00:03:28.709> again<00:03:29.709> this<00:03:30.010> is<00:03:30.189> something

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
counter-attack again this is something

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.460 
counter-attack again this is something
that<00:03:30.579> has<00:03:30.939> the<00:03:31.180> speed<00:03:31.450> of<00:03:31.659> a<00:03:31.750> chakra<00:03:32.109> a<00:03:32.139> dash

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
that has the speed of a chakra a dash

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.069 
that has the speed of a chakra a dash
and<00:03:32.709> it's<00:03:33.579> meant<00:03:33.819> to<00:03:33.909> be<00:03:33.939> very<00:03:34.359> quick<00:03:34.629> so<00:03:35.049> you

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:35.079 
and it's meant to be very quick so you

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:45.680 
and it's meant to be very quick so you
can<00:03:35.379> get<00:03:35.650> back<00:03:35.859> into<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.280> game

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:48.170 

I<00:03:45.860> see<00:03:46.860> this<00:03:47.070> as<00:03:47.130> something<00:03:47.280> very<00:03:47.820> important

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
I see this as something very important

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.850 
I see this as something very important
to<00:03:48.210> have<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.720> the<00:03:48.840> reason<00:03:48.990> to<00:03:49.290> that<00:03:49.470> is<00:03:49.650> very

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
to have and the reason to that is very

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.980 
to have and the reason to that is very
simple<00:03:50.180> every<00:03:51.180> time<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:51.510> get<00:03:51.630> knocked<00:03:51.870> back

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 
simple every time you get knocked back

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.080 
simple every time you get knocked back
on<00:03:52.320> knocked<00:03:52.650> down<00:03:52.830> you<00:03:53.400> can't<00:03:53.640> get<00:03:53.820> back<00:03:53.940> out

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
on knocked down you can't get back out

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:56.270 
on knocked down you can't get back out
quickly<00:03:54.420> to<00:03:54.630> counter<00:03:54.960> take<00:03:55.200> you<00:03:55.950> just

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
quickly to counter take you just

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.800 
quickly to counter take you just
automatically<00:03:56.820> bounded<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.330> wait<00:03:57.630> a<00:03:57.660> couple

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
automatically bounded to wait a couple

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.930 
automatically bounded to wait a couple
of<00:03:58.200> moments<00:03:58.410> before<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.100> really<00:03:59.370> get<00:03:59.490> back<00:03:59.700> at

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
of moments before you really get back at

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.870 
of moments before you really get back at
the<00:04:00.120> opponent<00:04:00.890> this<00:04:01.890> is<00:04:02.070> why<00:04:02.250> I'm<00:04:02.430> saying<00:04:02.640> that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
the opponent this is why I'm saying that

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.270 
the opponent this is why I'm saying that
in<00:04:03.180> general<00:04:03.210> cyberconnect2<00:04:04.170> should<00:04:04.740> focus<00:04:04.980> on

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:05.280 
in general cyberconnect2 should focus on

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.040 
in general cyberconnect2 should focus on
inventing<00:04:05.820> new<00:04:06.000> ways<00:04:06.210> of<00:04:06.480> getting<00:04:06.810> up<00:04:06.930> from

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
inventing new ways of getting up from

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.230 
inventing new ways of getting up from
the<00:04:07.200> ground<00:04:07.350> after<00:04:07.620> being<00:04:08.010> knocked<00:04:08.160> down<00:04:08.280> like

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
the ground after being knocked down like

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.960 
the ground after being knocked down like
I<00:04:09.270> just<00:04:09.600> showed<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.280> it<00:04:11.280> will<00:04:11.460> make<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.820> game

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
I just showed you it will make the game

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.420 
I just showed you it will make the game
more<00:04:12.000> dynamic<00:04:12.750> and<00:04:12.840> we<00:04:13.260> avoid<00:04:13.650> people<00:04:14.160> getting

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
more dynamic and we avoid people getting

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.070 
more dynamic and we avoid people getting
trapped<00:04:14.670> far<00:04:15.000> too<00:04:15.180> easily<00:04:15.360> by<00:04:15.660> different

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
trapped far too easily by different

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:18.349 
trapped far too easily by different
attacks<00:04:16.380> so<00:04:16.769> you'll<00:04:17.250> always<00:04:17.730> have<00:04:17.940> a<00:04:18.000> chance

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
attacks so you'll always have a chance

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.449 
attacks so you'll always have a chance
to<00:04:18.540> fight<00:04:18.750> back<00:04:18.780> you<00:04:19.380> can<00:04:19.500> also<00:04:19.650> consider<00:04:20.190> this

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
to fight back you can also consider this

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.730 
to fight back you can also consider this
as<00:04:20.730> some<00:04:21.090> kind<00:04:21.120> of<00:04:21.390> defense<00:04:21.930> mechanism<00:04:22.500> but

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
as some kind of defense mechanism but

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.860 
as some kind of defense mechanism but
that<00:04:22.980> subject<00:04:23.490> has<00:04:23.640> yet<00:04:23.850> to<00:04:23.970> come<00:04:24.180> up<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.540> this

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870 
that subject has yet to come up in this

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:28.910 
that subject has yet to come up in this
suggestion<00:04:25.350> video<00:04:25.800> series<00:04:26.930> so<00:04:27.930> again<00:04:28.260> these

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
suggestion video series so again these

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.060 
suggestion video series so again these
jumps<00:04:29.370> are<00:04:29.520> meant<00:04:29.820> to<00:04:30.000> be<00:04:30.030> very<00:04:30.480> quick<00:04:30.810> and

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
jumps are meant to be very quick and

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.220 
jumps are meant to be very quick and
actually<00:04:32.070> just<00:04:32.280> as<00:04:32.550> fast<00:04:32.820> as<00:04:33.150> the<00:04:33.270> chakra<00:04:33.660> s<00:04:33.930> so

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
actually just as fast as the chakra s so

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:35.960 
actually just as fast as the chakra s so
you<00:04:34.320> really<00:04:34.800> can<00:04:34.920> use<00:04:35.130> it<00:04:35.310> instead<00:04:35.520> of<00:04:35.640> getting

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
you really can use it instead of getting

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.450 
you really can use it instead of getting
interrupted<00:04:36.720> very<00:04:37.230> quickly<00:04:37.590> without<00:04:38.310> having

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
interrupted very quickly without having

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:43.160 
interrupted very quickly without having
any<00:04:38.910> options<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.270> getting<00:04:39.480> away<00:04:39.720> again<00:04:41.870> so<00:04:42.870> in

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
any options of getting away again so in

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.840 
any options of getting away again so in
the<00:04:43.290> next<00:04:43.380> video<00:04:43.740> we<00:04:44.040> would<00:04:44.190> talk<00:04:44.310> about<00:04:44.370> new

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:44.850 
the next video we would talk about new

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:47.240 
the next video we would talk about new
controllable<00:04:45.510> chakra<00:04:45.990> dashes<00:04:46.470> more<00:04:46.890> levels

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
controllable chakra dashes more levels

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.070 
controllable chakra dashes more levels
of<00:04:47.430> dashing<00:04:47.880> and<00:04:48.000> it's<00:04:48.540> going<00:04:48.750> to<00:04:48.870> be

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
of dashing and it's going to be

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.260 
of dashing and it's going to be
connected<00:04:49.320> with<00:04:49.500> what<00:04:50.130> you<00:04:50.250> just<00:04:50.430> saw<00:04:50.640> here<00:04:50.940> so
