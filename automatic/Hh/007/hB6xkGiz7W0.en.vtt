00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.170
 the fact that the same example came into much 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.640
 more democratic than 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.210
 creation of priests for example duel 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.000
 a year before the release of one which 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.100
 appreciated the creation 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.140
 device 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.790
 arbidol creation contest

 excellent move and led to the fact that 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.270
 the moment of exit is gone daily 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.460
 a large number of applications 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.400
 break the device to the full that it can 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.920
 bogota consider 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.170
 So this slider got with qwerty 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.399
 keyboard 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:13.240
 and say hello bye 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.899

 and as very bright juicy Pavlograd 40 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.400
 plus one more important detail 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.400
 cn and reacts easily to finger movements 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.050
 in this regard, guk housing fund handcuffed 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:08.540
 fund 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:10.080

 it really works 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:17.759
 almost immediately interesting 

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.919
 implemented 

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:21.599
 there are three desktops which can 

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.319
 beat down Japanese women as our heart desires 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.949
 does not cause 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.939
 there is such a release list 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.939
 view incoming messages 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.119
 simpler to say the story is very nice 

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:36.129
 buttons so that they fill the keyboard 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.239
 good too 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:39.329
 start and end paper output response 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:40.110
 on the action 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.369
 plus here's a small floor project 

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:44.479
 convenient scrolling examples 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:46.979
 we see of course where do without him 

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.929
 slider and fold easily 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:51.429
 count them with a flick of a finger 48 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:52.529
 stupid light 

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:55.119
 I was told that no Ukraine 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.670
 coming was only the beginning 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:00.029
 then the court got used much better 

00:03:00.029 --> 00:03:01.769
 anniversary of security of all 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.839

 one more detail is shifted porch 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.049
 straight to the floor 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.019
 how solid this one seems 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:15.969
 the mechanism is not clear here because 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:17.829
 Of course in Belarusian consume not one 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:18.929
 month 

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:20.729
 specifications here 

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:23.209
 anarchists song services to offer that pipe 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:24.629
 feeling unwell 

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:25.680
 with representatives of traditional 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.769
 compete in an area called iron 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.709
 since a year can come up with different 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.359
 Turkish program 

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.430
 slows down offended plays poorly 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.060
 nothing will save you 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.099
 complies with modern 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.119
 standards 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.419
 528 megahertz qualcomm processor 

00:03:41.419 --> 00:03:43.969
 192 megabytes of RAM 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:45.789
 in principle, everything is still early 

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:48.689
 positive turtle constantly 256 

00:03:48.689 --> 00:03:51.189
 megabyte but of course a lot but there is a place 

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:53.049
 for microsd memory cards 

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.269
 such data is not very easy to open but 

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:57.339
 males cope with it 

00:03:57.339 --> 00:03:59.199
 the card will be put to mix 

00:03:59.199 --> 00:04:00.399
 sisters music 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.389
 by the way i saw first 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.249
 high quality sound clean enough 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:06.159
 loud at the construction site Pechkin 

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:08.079
 individual ration is much better 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:10.919
 than a number of devices bandidos pabat 

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:12.939
 he dedicated not so rosy 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:14.089
 The most common 

00:04:14.089 --> 00:04:15.409
 file format they are waiting for not 

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:16.430
 reproduced 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.299
 we tried several formats 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.329
 even declared 4 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:21.939
 not extended 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:23.229
 so get ready to comment 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.169
 gigabytes of video memory that he plays all the same 

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.930
 not the most convenient to send 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.840
 those who were converted 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.610
 satiety typhoon because ruffled nerves 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.110
 with food 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.379
 and then there's nowhere to go 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:39.370
 headsets 

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:41.000
 so kindly 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.550
 apartments for their extremists 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:45.039
 the camera is something different from 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:46.499
 influences mood 

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:50.409
 although China has no mood at all 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:51.689
 with this form 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:54.689
 Kittens Crown Prince turns 

00:04:55.819 --> 00:04:57.469
 and poor quality 

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:00.229
 The battery has a capacity of 1150 megapir 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:00.779
 hour 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:02.569
 little if you listen to music 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:05.300
 for example trips were off perish 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.120
 and reading books they do not have enough davidovich 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.120
 while the charge is silent 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:14.779
 here so as kravchenko rock observable about 

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:15.380
 tom how 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:18.380
 he wants to take over the world 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.960
 leadership favor 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:32.529
 when sync 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:34.699
 the simplest 

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:37.059
 means that in it the most beautiful 

00:05:37.059 --> 00:05:40.059
 small gadgets 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:44.830
 headset in the text lawyers as we 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.789
 already said a complete collapse he of course 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:48.139
 pitot tube adjustment 

00:05:48.139 --> 00:05:49.050
 volume children 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.050
 average standard headphones 

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:56.210
 but for a long time 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.789
 Charger 

00:05:58.789 --> 00:06:00.080
 plus 3 which 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:01.669
 communication media again 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:03.800
 did not let us down on the mortgage of the first session 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.099
 and here is the profile of the year the border guards 

00:06:05.099 --> 00:06:07.919
 in fact, only work with the headset 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:09.740
 state of emergency from work with the preset 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.080
 google maps 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.860
 very interesting vs good 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.759
 internet surfing 

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.129
 true answer 

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:18.889
 This is generally the first subject bad 

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:20.649
 control so in the morning revolutionary 

00:06:20.649 --> 00:06:22.719
 how many disputed moments were there 

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:24.139
 it is their stay with us
