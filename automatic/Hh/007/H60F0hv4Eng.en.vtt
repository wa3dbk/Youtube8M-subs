but if they're not on your side you can

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.930 
but if they're not on your side you can
also<00:02:15.500> listen<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.950> their<00:02:16.130> reasons<00:02:16.520> and<00:02:16.790> then

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
also listen to their reasons and then

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.430 
also listen to their reasons and then
look<00:02:17.270> at<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> perspective<00:02:17.900> that<00:02:18.020> you<00:02:18.140> didn't

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
look at a perspective that you didn't

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
the market I would say this class is

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.630 
the market I would say this class is
really<00:02:45.170> good<00:02:45.290> at<00:02:45.380> teaching<00:02:45.470> how<00:02:46.310> important

and they'll pitch a stock based on like

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.199 
and they'll pitch a stock based on like
a<00:02:51.650> new<00:02:51.830> product<00:02:52.130> or<00:02:52.459> some<00:02:53.030> type<00:02:53.180> of

then you have to take a look at the

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:57.100 
then you have to take a look at the
stock<00:02:56.090> itself<00:02:56.390> to<00:02:56.540> see<00:02:56.660> if<00:02:56.690> it's<00:02:56.870> overvalued

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:57.110
