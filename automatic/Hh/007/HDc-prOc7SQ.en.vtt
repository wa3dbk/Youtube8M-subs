00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:02.610 
and sometimes people wonder what would

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.030 
and sometimes people wonder what would
happen<00:00:02.760> if<00:00:03.030> I<00:00:03.120> drop<00:00:03.389> this<00:00:03.600> microphone<00:00:04.140> like<00:00:04.410> am

happen if I drop this microphone like am
I<00:00:05.130> going<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.430> damage<00:00:05.730> this<00:00:05.819> microphone<00:00:06.330> well

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:07.550 
I going to damage this microphone well

I going to damage this microphone well
one<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.790> characteristics<00:00:09.450> of<00:00:09.540> a<00:00:09.660> dynamic

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
one of the characteristics of a dynamic

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.990 
one of the characteristics of a dynamic
microphone<00:00:10.679> is<00:00:11.010> that<00:00:11.219> they<00:00:11.370> can<00:00:11.550> take<00:00:11.700> a<00:00:11.730> lot

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
microphone is that they can take a lot

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.350 
microphone is that they can take a lot
of<00:00:12.030> abuse<00:00:13.160> now<00:00:14.160> there<00:00:14.759> are<00:00:14.849> some<00:00:15.030> really

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
of abuse now there are some really

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.650 
of abuse now there are some really
popular<00:00:15.540> microphones<00:00:16.260> like<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.470> sm58<00:00:17.660> that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
popular microphones like in sm58 that

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.769 
popular microphones like in sm58 that
the<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.320> ball<00:00:19.529> screen<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:21.210> protects<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
the the ball screen it protects the

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.359 
the the ball screen it protects the
microphone<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.350> protects<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.769> capsule<00:00:23.220> but

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
microphone it protects the capsule but

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.570 
microphone it protects the capsule but
it's<00:00:23.970> not<00:00:24.180> hardened<00:00:25.140> steel<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:26.250> if<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.400> drop

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
it's not hardened steel so if you drop

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.609 
it's not hardened steel so if you drop
that<00:00:26.789> microphone<00:00:27.330> you<00:00:27.750> might<00:00:27.900> get<00:00:28.050> a<00:00:28.080> dent<00:00:28.410> but

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
that microphone you might get a dent but

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.620 
that microphone you might get a dent but
I<00:00:29.189> mean<00:00:29.609> that's<00:00:29.760> all<00:00:29.910> you<00:00:30.000> get<00:00:30.119> you<00:00:30.269> get<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.539> in

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I mean that's all you get you get it in

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.569 
I mean that's all you get you get it in
it<00:00:30.750> doesn't<00:00:31.019> look<00:00:31.140> so<00:00:31.289> good<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.679> it's<00:00:31.830> it

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
it doesn't look so good but it's it

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.130 
it doesn't look so good but it's it
doesn't<00:00:32.730> hurt<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.090> microphone<00:00:33.540> it<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.050> know

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
doesn't hurt the microphone it you know

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.780 
doesn't hurt the microphone it you know
it's<00:00:34.380> it's<00:00:34.559> always<00:00:34.770> better<00:00:35.040> not<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> drop

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
it's it's always better not to drop

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.280 
it's it's always better not to drop
things<00:00:36.030> but<00:00:36.360> if<00:00:36.600> you<00:00:36.660> do<00:00:36.870> it's<00:00:37.020> not<00:00:37.140> gonna

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
things but if you do it's not gonna

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.860 
things but if you do it's not gonna
damage<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.739> microphone<00:00:38.129> our<00:00:39.030> microphone<00:00:39.629> the

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
damage the microphone our microphone the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.190 
damage the microphone our microphone the
MB<00:00:40.739> 70<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.460> ambi<00:00:42.090> 75<00:00:42.540> +<00:00:42.750> MP<00:00:42.840> 76<00:00:43.350> our<00:00:45.200> screens

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
MB 70 and ambi 75 + MP 76 our screens

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.060 
MB 70 and ambi 75 + MP 76 our screens
are<00:00:46.649> all<00:00:47.309> hardened<00:00:48.270> so<00:00:48.750> what<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.649> means<00:00:49.860> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
are all hardened so what that means is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.729 
are all hardened so what that means is
first<00:00:50.340> they<00:00:50.520> form<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.090> screen<00:00:51.469> and<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.530> shape

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
first they form the screen and the shape

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.920 
first they form the screen and the shape
that<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.129> and<00:00:53.430> then<00:00:54.149> they<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.420> heat

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
that it is and then they actually heat

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.810 
that it is and then they actually heat
harden<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.860> these<00:00:56.039> things<00:00:56.219> they<00:00:56.399> get<00:00:56.520> red

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
harden it so these things they get red

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.880 
harden it so these things they get red
hot<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:57.420> then<00:00:57.809> they<00:00:57.930> cool<00:00:58.170> them<00:00:58.379> down<00:00:58.410> really

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
hot and then they cool them down really

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.920 
hot and then they cool them down really
quickly<00:00:59.219> and<00:00:59.579> I<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.570> some<00:01:00.719> type<00:01:00.899> of

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
quickly and I I think it's some type of

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.810 
quickly and I I think it's some type of
oil<00:01:01.289> or<00:01:01.469> something<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.890> that<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.340> that's

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
oil or something like that and that's

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.460 
oil or something like that and that's
what<00:01:02.969> they<00:01:03.059> do<00:01:03.120> before<00:01:03.420> they<00:01:03.660> they<00:01:04.199> put<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
what they do before they they put the

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.950 
what they do before they they put the
finish<00:01:04.680> on<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.760> as<00:01:05.909> a<00:01:05.939> result<00:01:06.299> this

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
finish on them so as a result this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.750 
finish on them so as a result this
microphone<00:01:07.470> can<00:01:07.680> take<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:07.860> lot<00:01:08.070> of<00:01:08.100> abuse<00:01:08.310> and

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
microphone can take a lot of abuse and

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.070 
microphone can take a lot of abuse and
to<00:01:09.090> show<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.479> kind<00:01:09.659> of<00:01:09.720> abuse<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.049> can

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
to show you the kind of abuse you can

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.770 
to show you the kind of abuse you can
take<00:01:10.350> I'm<00:01:11.280> gonna<00:01:11.430> drop<00:01:11.760> it<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.390> I'm<00:01:12.450> gonna<00:01:12.570> take

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.590 
doesn't it won't get damaged as far as
its<00:01:51.119> functionality<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.500> will<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.920> know<00:01:53.040> you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
its functionality it will you know you

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.700 
its functionality it will you know you
sort<00:01:54.600> of<00:01:54.689> change<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:55.110> shape<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> ball<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
sort of change the shape of the ball a

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.260 
sort of change the shape of the ball a
little<00:01:56.009> bit<00:01:56.130> but<00:01:56.310> you<00:01:56.700> probably<00:01:57.030> wouldn't

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
little bit but you probably wouldn't

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.310 
little bit but you probably wouldn't
even<00:01:57.329> notice<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:57.869> unless<00:01:57.990> you<00:01:58.200> were<00:01:58.290> looking

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
even notice it unless you were looking

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.910 
even notice it unless you were looking
for<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.009> inside<00:02:00.200> it's<00:02:01.200> just<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.710> it's

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
for it and inside it's just that it's

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.100 
for it and inside it's just that it's
that<00:02:02.070> diaphragm<00:02:02.460> it<00:02:03.000> when<00:02:03.390> you<00:02:03.479> drop<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
that diaphragm it when you drop it I

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.600 
that diaphragm it when you drop it I
mean<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.530> voice<00:02:04.680> coil<00:02:04.950> might<00:02:05.219> wiggle<00:02:05.579> a

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
mean the voice coil might wiggle a

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.070 
mean the voice coil might wiggle a
little<00:02:05.729> bit<00:02:05.969> but

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
little bit but

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.130 
little bit but
it's<00:02:08.620> not<00:02:08.830> gonna<00:02:09.010> damage<00:02:09.250> the<00:02:09.430> microphone<00:02:10.140> so

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
it's not gonna damage the microphone so

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:12.570 
it's not gonna damage the microphone so
not<00:02:11.440> all<00:02:11.560> even<00:02:11.830> I'll<00:02:11.950> just<00:02:12.100> plug<00:02:12.310> it<00:02:12.400> in<00:02:12.490> to

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
not all even I'll just plug it in to

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.710 
not all even I'll just plug it in to
show<00:02:12.610> you<00:02:12.850> that<00:02:12.970> it<00:02:13.090> still<00:02:13.300> works

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
show you that it still works

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.720 
show you that it still works
no<00:02:13.960> let's<00:02:14.620> hopefully<00:02:15.010> it<00:02:15.130> does<00:02:15.370> still<00:02:15.610> work

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
no let's hopefully it does still work

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.420 
no let's hopefully it does still work
right<00:02:15.840> check<00:02:16.840> check<00:02:17.110> oh<00:02:17.230> yeah<00:02:17.770> it<00:02:17.950> does<00:02:18.130> still

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
right check check oh yeah it does still

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:26.310 
right check check oh yeah it does still
work<00:02:18.550> so<00:02:18.760> there<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.330> go<00:02:21.300> cause<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.570> death<00:02:25.320> the

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
work so there you go cause of death the

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:28.050 
work so there you go cause of death the
most<00:02:26.530> common<00:02:26.980> cause<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.160> mic<00:02:27.520> death

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
most common cause of mic death

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.640 
most common cause of mic death
um<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:29.530> guess<00:02:30.340> getting<00:02:30.880> run<00:02:31.060> over<00:02:31.090> by<00:02:31.570> trains<00:02:32.350> or

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
um I guess getting run over by trains or

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.150 
um I guess getting run over by trains or
something

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
something

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.730 
something
they're<00:02:33.730> pretty<00:02:34.450> indestructible<00:02:34.870> I<00:02:35.350> think

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
they're pretty indestructible I think

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:38.910 
they're pretty indestructible I think
maybe<00:02:36.120> um<00:02:37.120> I<00:02:37.260> don't<00:02:38.260> know<00:02:38.320> if<00:02:38.380> it<00:02:38.470> kills<00:02:38.740> the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
maybe um I don't know if it kills the

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.450 
maybe um I don't know if it kills the
microphone<00:02:39.400> but<00:02:39.670> I<00:02:39.850> think<00:02:40.210> if<00:02:40.980> if<00:02:41.980> it<00:02:42.130> was<00:02:42.250> left

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
microphone but I think if if it was left

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.300 
microphone but I think if if it was left
out<00:02:42.610> in<00:02:42.640> the<00:02:42.820> rain<00:02:42.900> I'm<00:02:43.900> getting<00:02:44.230> maybe<00:02:44.440> if

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:45.310 
out in the rain I'm getting maybe if

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:48.060 
out in the rain I'm getting maybe if
there's<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.780> some<00:02:46.780> corrosion<00:02:47.140> actually<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:47.950> the

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:48.070 
there's a some corrosion actually in the

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.190 
there's a some corrosion actually in the
gap<00:02:48.280> and<00:02:48.580> the<00:02:48.640> magnet<00:02:49.030> magnetic<00:02:49.690> gap<00:02:49.900> where

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.200 
gap and the magnet magnetic gap where

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.230 
gap and the magnet magnetic gap where
the<00:02:50.230> voice<00:02:50.470> cold<00:02:50.710> I<00:02:51.310> would<00:02:51.490> that<00:02:51.940> would<00:02:52.060> damage

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
the voice cold I would that would damage

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.850 
the voice cold I would that would damage
a<00:02:52.480> microphone<00:02:52.900> that<00:02:53.110> would<00:02:53.230> cause<00:02:53.410> it<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.650> stop

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
a microphone that would cause it to stop

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:58.440 
a microphone that would cause it to stop
working<00:02:55.950> yeah<00:02:56.950> I<00:02:56.980> think<00:02:57.370> dynamic<00:02:58.000> microphones

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.450 
working yeah I think dynamic microphones

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.830 
working yeah I think dynamic microphones
in<00:02:58.630> general<00:02:59.020> they're<00:02:59.920> pretty<00:03:00.130> indestructible

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
in general they're pretty indestructible

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.140 
in general they're pretty indestructible
likely<00:03:01.840> I<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.860> guess<00:03:03.190> if<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.400> microphone<00:03:03.820> did

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
likely I I guess if a microphone did

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.120 
likely I I guess if a microphone did
fail<00:03:04.480> after<00:03:04.960> a<00:03:05.230> person<00:03:05.590> had<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.950> and<00:03:06.070> they

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
fail after a person had it and they

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:07.590 
fail after a person had it and they
dropped<00:03:06.400> it<00:03:06.580> or<00:03:06.700> something<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.030> few<00:03:07.150> times<00:03:07.420> it

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
dropped it or something a few times it

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.560 
dropped it or something a few times it
probably<00:03:07.930> has<00:03:08.080> more<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.440> do<00:03:08.590> with<00:03:08.770> a

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
probably has more to do with a

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.640 
probably has more to do with a
manufacturing<00:03:10.570> defect<00:03:10.780> maybe<00:03:11.290> there<00:03:11.530> was

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
manufacturing defect maybe there was

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.560 
manufacturing defect maybe there was
something<00:03:11.860> a<00:03:12.250> solder<00:03:12.760> joint<00:03:12.880> wasn't<00:03:13.420> made

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
something a solder joint wasn't made

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.360 
something a solder joint wasn't made
very<00:03:13.810> well<00:03:13.990> so<00:03:14.170> just<00:03:14.350> shaking<00:03:15.160> it<00:03:15.280> or

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
very well so just shaking it or

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.130 
very well so just shaking it or
vibrating<00:03:15.970> would<00:03:16.150> you<00:03:16.480> know<00:03:16.600> cause<00:03:16.840> the<00:03:17.110> the

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
vibrating would you know cause the the

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.140 
vibrating would you know cause the the
the<00:03:17.890> wire<00:03:18.100> to<00:03:18.280> come<00:03:18.430> off<00:03:18.580> or<00:03:18.760> something<00:03:19.000> like

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the wire to come off or something like

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.350 
the wire to come off or something like
that<00:03:19.360> but<00:03:19.630> and<00:03:20.200> generally<00:03:20.890> generally<00:03:21.700> dynamic

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
that but and generally generally dynamic

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.890 
that but and generally generally dynamic
microphones<00:03:22.810> are<00:03:22.990> quite<00:03:23.170> indestructible
