too much about those consoles and a lot

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.240 
too much about those consoles and a lot
of<00:00:33.540> you<00:00:33.750> actually<00:00:33.960> expressed<00:00:34.440> your<00:00:34.680> desire<00:00:34.829> to

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
of you actually expressed your desire to

of you actually expressed your desire to
move<00:00:35.399> over<00:00:35.640> to<00:00:35.760> PC<00:00:36.270> gaming<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.780> thought<00:00:37.020> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
move over to PC gaming you thought the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.660 
move over to PC gaming you thought the
cost<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.710> sort<00:00:37.920> of<00:00:37.950> coming<00:00:38.280> down<00:00:38.309> for

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
cost was sort of coming down for

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.369 
cost was sort of coming down for
components<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.329> stuff<00:00:39.480> like<00:00:39.629> that<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.989> you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
components and stuff like that and you

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.750 
components and stuff like that and you
said<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.590> was<00:00:40.680> cheaper<00:00:41.070> than<00:00:41.160> ever<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.579> move

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
said it was cheaper than ever to move

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.030 
said it was cheaper than ever to move
across<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.180> PC<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.620> really<00:00:43.800> what<00:00:44.010> I

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
across to PC so that's really what I

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.590 
across to PC so that's really what I
want<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.340> talk<00:00:44.520> about<00:00:44.550> today<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.450> talk

pc but i can tell you right off the bat
know<00:02:45.069> what<00:02:45.849> those<00:02:46.000> pcs<00:02:46.480> were<00:02:46.659> running<00:02:47.019> was<00:02:47.319> a

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
know what those pcs were running was a

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:49.349 
know what those pcs were running was a
pre-alpha<00:02:47.920> version<00:02:48.099> of<00:02:48.459> battlefield<00:02:48.879> 4<00:02:49.090> which

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:49.359 
pre-alpha version of battlefield 4 which

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.000 
pre-alpha version of battlefield 4 which
in<00:02:49.540> layman's<00:02:49.659> terms<00:02:49.959> means<00:02:50.379> it's<00:02:50.530> completely

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
in layman's terms means it's completely

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.259 
in layman's terms means it's completely
uh<00:02:51.040> not<00:02:51.250> to<00:02:51.400> Mai's<00:02:51.549> for<00:02:51.760> the<00:02:51.819> system<00:02:52.120> it's

00:02:52.259 --> 00:02:52.269 
uh not to Mai's for the system it's

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:53.670 
uh not to Mai's for the system it's
actually<00:02:52.540> running<00:02:52.750> on<00:02:52.930> so<00:02:53.260> they<00:02:53.349> have<00:02:53.530> to

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
actually running on so they have to

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.440 
actually running on so they have to
compensate<00:02:54.040> for<00:02:54.489> that<00:02:54.519> by<00:02:54.639> giving<00:02:55.120> it<00:02:55.359> an

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
compensate for that by giving it an

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:57.839 
compensate for that by giving it an
overkill<00:02:55.959> machine<00:02:56.409> this<00:02:57.129> way<00:02:57.310> we<00:02:57.489> didn't<00:02:57.730> see

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
personally I'm pretty much going to go

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.490 
personally I'm pretty much going to go
along<00:03:57.970> the<00:03:58.120> lines<00:03:58.329> of<00:03:58.479> what<00:03:58.659> DICE<00:03:58.959> has<00:03:58.989> built

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.439 
along the lines of what DICE has built
so<00:03:59.769> far<00:04:00.069> I'm<00:04:00.370> going<00:04:00.729> to<00:04:00.790> be<00:04:00.849> trying<00:04:01.120> to<00:04:01.299> upgrade

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:01.449 
so far I'm going to be trying to upgrade

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:04.619 
so far I'm going to be trying to upgrade
my<00:04:01.690> cpu<00:04:02.349> either<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.979> an<00:04:03.220> eight<00:04:03.489> core<00:04:03.849> AMD<00:04:04.359> or<00:04:04.540> a

00:04:04.619 --> 00:04:04.629 
my cpu either to an eight core AMD or a

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.680 
my cpu either to an eight core AMD or a
core<00:04:05.349> i7<00:04:05.530> on<00:04:06.010> the<00:04:06.099> Intel<00:04:06.519> side<00:04:06.819> now<00:04:07.389> one<00:04:07.599> of

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
core i7 on the Intel side now one of

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.509 
core i7 on the Intel side now one of
those<00:04:07.780> upgrades<00:04:08.199> would<00:04:08.349> require<00:04:08.739> me<00:04:08.979> to<00:04:09.010> get

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
those upgrades would require me to get

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.189 
those upgrades would require me to get
out<00:04:09.639> a<00:04:09.669> new<00:04:09.940> motherboard<00:04:10.269> as<00:04:10.569> well<00:04:10.780> because<00:04:11.109> an

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:11.199 
out a new motherboard as well because an

00:04:11.199 --> 00:04:13.170 
out a new motherboard as well because an
intel<00:04:11.530> socket<00:04:11.709> doesn't<00:04:12.220> fit<00:04:12.400> into<00:04:12.579> my<00:04:12.790> current

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.180 
intel socket doesn't fit into my current

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.000 
intel socket doesn't fit into my current
motherboard<00:04:13.690> so<00:04:14.079> i<00:04:14.109> might<00:04:14.470> be<00:04:14.680> steering

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
motherboard so i might be steering

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.890 
motherboard so i might be steering
towards<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.400> AMD<00:04:15.849> side<00:04:16.090> of<00:04:16.269> things<00:04:16.389> however

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
towards the AMD side of things however

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.300 
towards the AMD side of things however
intel<00:04:17.320> does<00:04:17.470> have<00:04:17.650> some<00:04:17.829> seriously<00:04:18.220> good

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
intel does have some seriously good

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.039 
intel does have some seriously good
performance<00:04:18.940> at<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.120> moment<00:04:19.449> I've<00:04:19.840> already

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
performance at the moment I've already

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.740 
performance at the moment I've already
got<00:04:20.380> 16<00:04:20.799> gigabytes<00:04:21.310> of<00:04:21.459> ram<00:04:21.700> running<00:04:22.000> at<00:04:22.090> 1600

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
got 16 gigabytes of ram running at 1600

so<00:04:26.370> I'm<00:04:26.460> pretty<00:04:26.580> much<00:04:26.790> set<00:04:27.090> there<00:04:27.360> but

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
so I'm pretty much set there but

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.870 
so I'm pretty much set there but
currently<00:04:28.470> what's<00:04:28.710> lacking<00:04:28.920> behind<00:04:29.190> in<00:04:29.490> my<00:04:29.640> PC

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
currently what's lacking behind in my PC

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.000 
currently what's lacking behind in my PC
is<00:04:30.090> my<00:04:30.450> graphics<00:04:30.930> card<00:04:30.990> at<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.560> moment<00:04:31.890> i'm

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
is my graphics card at the moment i'm

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:35.210 
is my graphics card at the moment i'm
