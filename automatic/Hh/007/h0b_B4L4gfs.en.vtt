00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:20.789
 I'm going to show you how to do it 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.599

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.740
 place on the stones 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:34.270
 this was a used shoe of jessica 

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:37.210
 Simpson who decorates it with stones is very 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:42.070
 easy I'm going to tell you what they are going to 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:45.610
 need and that's how shoe looks 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 before being decorated 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.300

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.810

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.330
 do looks very elegant and very chic I 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.300
 I chose this color because I think 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:10.060
 perfect for wearing with blue jeans 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.300
 a white shirt or if you want a shirt 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:15.090

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.510
 I teach the other shoes that I have made 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:34.900
 I make these shoes because I sell them 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.890
 on ebay and also some people I 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:43.040

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.930
 Y 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.940
 you will not charge so expensive 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:52.690
 stones are very economical I think that 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:56.980
 they are not going out because there are some that come out 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:59.040

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:04.810
