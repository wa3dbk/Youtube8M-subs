00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.000
 at tt electronics with the gate with the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.959
 new ditto stereo magnifier da eg into the water 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.230
 ten goals 

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:19.830
 what 's new we have a whole 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.560
 new luca made it's the medium 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.369
 Brothers witchen the little and the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.590
 Great the 62 and with this job 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:39.569
 rather you get the stereo function 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:41.999
 you also get called backing tracks and 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:46.650
 With this feature you can doubs 

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:49.140
 from your computer to the pedals 

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:51.510
 import and you could too 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.230
 Looks of the pedals that you made with 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.860
 a guitar back to your computer 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.640
 So send that to logic or cubase 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.820
 or garage band music can do with 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:08.610
 loops the duo has made to the pedals 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:13.760
 and that leaves the thing that way, too 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.760
 Passer is is this gap can 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.229
 Battery compartment with sympathy must be for 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:26.010
 for acoustic guitarists that's easy 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:28.260
 very important because electric guitar 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.860
 has a typical big board with power 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:33.840
 supplies and so but acoustic guitarist 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.869
 Billy does not like that 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.640
 if you have a ball with the whole look 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.580
 to make an acoustic guitar 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.710
 there you can only from battery 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:47.310
 okay, they are already in production or 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.310
 when are you coming out? 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:02:07.180
 Three weeks and priced are the 100 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:08.500
 29 okay alright everything okay all right 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.970
 then we are curious if it 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.800
 Maybe it also comes out in the 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.360
 You can also try antesten tories 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:16.540
 after many thanks for your approach 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:18.790
 have tried in German and 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.850
 wish you a lot of fun at the fair many 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.850
 thanks
