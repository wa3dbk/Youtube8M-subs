to my scalp is a good sign that it is

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.610 
to my scalp is a good sign that it is

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
out because then I probably should have

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.870 
out because then I probably should have

let it grow a little hunger because it

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.009 
let it grow a little hunger because it
