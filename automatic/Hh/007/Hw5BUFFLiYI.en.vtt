00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.160
 It's no secret that Israel is one of the most 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.200
 warring countries in the world and she always 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.460
 moves by leaps and bounds in the field 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.130
 military developments 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.380
 today we will tell and show the newest 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.410
 achievements of the Israeli gunsmiths tank 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.279
 merkava mark4 it is his many experts 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 is rightly considered the best tank in the world 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.010
 bright mark4 pride of the israeli army 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.730
 ground army main battle tank 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 tsahala 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:32.399
 on technical equipment of this tank 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.070
 no match in the world that's why he 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.870
 considered to be invincible in the world 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.870
 called the sacred chariot 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.760
 the main criterion in the development of the tank 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:45.829
 merkava 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.879
 for the Israeli designers was 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.350
 crew safety is therefore driven 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.079
 placed not in the feed as usual 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.720
 happens in the nose of the combat vehicle 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.750
 because of this the team happened a bit 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:02.540
 back and now if the enemy shell 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:04.729
 will pierce the front armor of the tank engine 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.250
 will fail but will work as 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:09.440
 additional shield and tank crews will remain 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.360
 safe and sound israel 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.090
 the only country in the world that 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.310
 serially produces tanks with front 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.789
 the location of the motor-transmission 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.320
 offices is one of the options 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:25.340
 plastic layout but nonetheless 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.970
 they have an engine in front and in 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.149
 stern 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.009
 located fighting compartment for 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.190
 ensure complete crew safety 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:36.740
 multi layer was installed on the merkavu 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.259
 armor is made by an Israeli tank 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.720
 virtually invulnerable its hard 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.090
 punch and kinetic and cumulative 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.459
 projectiles such that 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.080
 stuffed with explosives and hexogen he and 

00:01:46.459 --> 00:01:49.720
 can burn tank armor 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:53.150
 practically 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.220
 Israeli tank armor difficult to burn 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.380
 because by its structure it 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.479
 resembles a layered cake in 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.110
 the rest of the layer should be a layer of 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.990
 ceramics 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:06.280
 then kevlar then ceramics again and 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.200
 become this way with the defeat of the tank 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.160
 the enemy shell is braked first 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.340
 layers of armor 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:18.220
 thanks to this the merkava remains not 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:20.480
 hurts in the case of a multilayer barrier 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.500
 if the background is this focus on both on 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.230
 armor surfaces 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.810
 making its way from this steel first sheet 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.610
 but 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.880
 composite materials disperse 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:32.510
 jet and inner layer is the third layer 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.170
 good not 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.750
 It does not break through the whole multilayer 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.660
 booking reliably protects the tank 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.239
 true today they can boast 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:47.420
 almost all tanks are worlds like 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.070
 composite armor was used in the 60s 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.269
 Soviet years 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.730
 constructors 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.340
 equipped her to the beach promise 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:58.500
 here is the active protection complex which 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.040
 israeli weapon obscurity or its 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.220
 merkava 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:04.950
 development of a unique such system no 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.940
 not a single tank to live is not American 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.650
 Abrams of German lepo 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.430
 forever uk and have agan chimney 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.590
 active hotel tanks electronic strenuously 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.459
 active protection systems are being developed 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.410
 for chadha tanks their food for mr in all 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.900
 armies numbers understand both in general and 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.670
 it became clear many years ago that for 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.459
 order to protect the tank from all sides 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.680
 pass and need to create a different many 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.599
 shon us a typewriter different from 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.879
 existing technologies can 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:40.590
 Migunov advice we just had time to do 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:42.720
 this is 1 and I al hulya trophy such a name 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 Israeli designers gave their 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.569
 the complex of active protection seems to be 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.329
 tank shells 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.209
 his main task will protect the world from the bark 

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:55.090
 any impending danger acts 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:56.709
 he follows on the tank tower 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.409
 4 radars are installed 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:02.189
 round the clock they monitor the situation on 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.870
 the field under the cabin is a computer 

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:08.049
 reads information from these radars 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:10.420
 as soon as the enemy shell turns out 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.700
 in the zone of visibility of the trophy system 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.030
 computer alarm is sent 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:18.139
 after that the computer is practically 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.540
 instantly determines where it goes from 

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.550
 fire calculates the flight path 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:25.430
 enemy projectile and gives the command 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.130
 system of opposition she releases 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.900
 special anti-missiles that fly 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:33.320
 towards enemy projectile 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.470
 and close to him explode form 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:38.900
 huge clouds 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.570
 but the most amazing complex is active 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.310
 protection tank merkava can reflect 

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:46.420
 at the same time 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:50.140
 several attacks from different sides 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:52.900
 and to whom is this system equipped with two 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.070
 intercept devices if missiles 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.290
 started up on both sides 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:58.780
 these are both devices independent of each other 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.760
 hands account between his legs but they for the base 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.980
 the system is able to follow large 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:04.960
 the number of threats simultaneously and in 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.480
 able to neutralize several from both 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:10.420
 Schmitt both sides have not slept 

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.550
 mimbi mobile alt from an Israeli tank 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:17.070
 the merkava is still the newest 

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:19.330
 120mm smoothbore gun 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.850
 actually guns of this caliber 

00:05:19.330 --> 00:05:25.300
 equipped with many modern tanks 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.020
 but the gun is merkava especially she 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:31.180
 ability to shoot hyper sound 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.490
 anti-tank shells such shells 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.610
 equipped with air-jet 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.100
 engines it means that in flight they 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:41.540
 do not lose speed at all unlike 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:43.880
 ordinary king 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:47.210
 hypersonic shells fly further a 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.699
 more damage they do 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.600
 just imagine such shells 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:56.169
 able to flash the armor of three tanks at once 

00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:59.319
 standing next to each other 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:03.280
 besides this merkava can fire 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:05.900
 special bomb lunar acer shell 

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:08.720
 which allows you to work against 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:12.190
 fortifications what he first punches 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.720
 wall and then inside explodes 

00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:16.039
 cassettes that contain ready and 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:19.039
 damaging elements 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:20.840
 besides hypersonic shells and bombing 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.940
 Mirkalla cassettes can shoot 

00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:25.759
 guided missiles and varnish 

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.650
 these unique shells are capable 

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:30.380
 destroy nickname only armored vehicles 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.789
 enemy fortifications but also boats and 

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.860
 even helicopters 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:37.130
 the rocket flies with a significant excess 

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:40.340
 on the trajectory and decreases to the level 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.860
 goals for height mean literally for 

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:46.729
 150 200 meters to the target such a mode 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.449
 allows you to overcome there shrub 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:52.310
 undersized trees and so on 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:56.240
 the safety of the fact that the rocket will fall on 

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:58.490
 trajectories other than the main gun on 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:01.820
 turret merkavy placed two machine guns 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:04.400
 and on the sides smoke grenade launchers if 

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:06.560
 the tank needs to retreat from the battlefield or on 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.689
 time to disappear he shoots 

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:11.539
 special grenades in the brain 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:14.360
 lined up and the tank smoke screen can 

00:07:11.539 --> 00:07:17.029
 save it from destruction there is such 

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.439
 means like these here are flue 

00:07:17.029 --> 00:07:21.709
 rocket launchers for literally 

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:23.749
 few seconds on modern 

00:07:21.709 --> 00:07:26.089
 grenade launcher them this time is from 

00:07:23.749 --> 00:07:28.059
 one and a half to three seconds tank can 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:30.949
 put a smoke screen 

00:07:28.059 --> 00:07:33.519
 which will hide him from sight 

00:07:30.949 --> 00:07:36.110
 helicopter sighting system and 

00:07:33.519 --> 00:07:39.159
 respectively the vision of anti-tank 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:42.110
 show a rocket ceiling will break 

00:07:39.159 --> 00:07:44.929
 Israeli gunsmiths assure if 

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:47.179
 the smoke screen will dissipate and the tank will suddenly not 

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:49.459
 have time to retreat complex active 

00:07:47.179 --> 00:07:51.949
 protect the traffic will ensure it 

00:07:49.459 --> 00:07:54.110
 security until you arrive 

00:07:51.949 --> 00:07:56.059
 reinforcement after all merkava with 

00:07:54.110 --> 00:07:56.599
 installed on her complex active 

00:07:56.059 --> 00:07:59.539
 of protection 

00:07:56.599 --> 00:08:01.830
 able to neutralize up to 6 flying 

00:07:59.539 --> 00:08:03.480
 rockets simultaneously 

00:08:01.830 --> 00:08:05.370
 it only remains to add that 

00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:07.590
 first set of active protection against 

00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:10.290
 anti-tank missiles was developed yet 

00:08:07.590 --> 00:08:12.840
 Soviet designers in the 80s 

00:08:10.290 --> 00:08:15.480
 he was called an arena for some 

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.580
 inexplicable reason on our tanks his 

00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.580
 practically no one sees in
