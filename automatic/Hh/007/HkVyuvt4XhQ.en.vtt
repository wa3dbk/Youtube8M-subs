00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:14.959 
I don't know if this is a problem for

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.630 
I don't know if this is a problem for
you<00:02:15.110> guys<00:02:15.319> it<00:02:16.250> could<00:02:16.370> be<00:02:16.750> hey<00:02:17.750> not<00:02:18.189> but<00:02:19.189> we<00:02:19.340> we

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
you guys it could be hey not but we we

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.940 
you guys it could be hey not but we we
tend<00:02:19.879> to<00:02:19.970> eat<00:02:20.120> out<00:02:20.299> a<00:02:20.329> lot<00:02:20.540> and<00:02:20.659> sometimes<00:02:21.049> it's

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
tend to eat out a lot and sometimes it's

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:24.399 
tend to eat out a lot and sometimes it's
you<00:02:22.489> know<00:02:22.610> it's<00:02:22.909> not<00:02:23.090> us<00:02:23.390> eating<00:02:23.840> out<00:02:23.959> like<00:02:24.170> my

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
you know it's not us eating out like my

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:26.649 
you know it's not us eating out like my
parents<00:02:24.680> might<00:02:25.129> want<00:02:25.819> to<00:02:25.879> go<00:02:26.000> somewhere<00:02:26.269> and

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
parents might want to go somewhere and

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.780 
parents might want to go somewhere and
and<00:02:26.959> they'll<00:02:27.110> ask<00:02:27.829> us<00:02:28.099> if<00:02:28.220> we<00:02:28.250> want<00:02:28.519> to<00:02:28.549> go<00:02:28.670> and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
and they'll ask us if we want to go and

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.619 
and they'll ask us if we want to go and
then<00:02:28.909> we'll<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.120> with<00:02:29.239> them

00:02:29.619 --> 00:02:29.629 
then we'll go with them

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.649 
then we'll go with them
and<00:02:30.440> maybe<00:02:31.370> it's<00:02:31.640> just<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> combination<00:02:32.150> of

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:32.659 
and maybe it's just the combination of

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.119 
and maybe it's just the combination of
sometimes<00:02:33.170> we'll<00:02:33.440> go<00:02:33.560> out<00:02:33.739> and<00:02:34.010> then

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
sometimes we'll go out and then

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.500 
sometimes we'll go out and then
sometimes<00:02:34.519> we'll<00:02:34.730> go<00:02:34.819> out<00:02:34.940> with<00:02:35.060> my<00:02:35.150> parents

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
sometimes we'll go out with my parents

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.509 
sometimes we'll go out with my parents
and<00:02:35.599> then<00:02:35.690> we<00:02:35.720> might<00:02:35.900> go<00:02:36.019> out<00:02:36.049> again<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.430> I

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
and then we might go out again and I

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:39.339 
and then we might go out again and I
guess<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.819> just<00:02:37.849> in<00:02:38.090> quick<00:02:38.269> succession<00:02:38.510> it

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 
guess it's just in quick succession it

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.660 
guess it's just in quick succession it
makes<00:02:39.620> it<00:02:39.769> feel<00:02:39.890> like<00:02:39.950> we're<00:02:40.220> eating<00:02:40.400> out<00:02:40.519> more

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
makes it feel like we're eating out more

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.080 
makes it feel like we're eating out more
than<00:02:40.790> we<00:02:40.909> are

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
than we are

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:42.640 
than we are
although<00:02:41.629> we<00:02:41.750> definitely<00:02:42.140> eat<00:02:42.230> out<00:02:42.379> more<00:02:42.560> than

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
although we definitely eat out more than

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.089 
although we definitely eat out more than
we<00:02:42.739> ever<00:02:42.829> did<00:02:43.040> I<00:02:43.250> think<00:02:43.760> back<00:02:43.939> to<00:02:44.769> earlier<00:02:45.769> vlog

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:46.099

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
journey will remember when we were in

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:53.170 
journey will remember when we were in
Colombia<00:02:51.709> when<00:02:52.069> we<00:02:52.190> first<00:02:52.459> moved<00:02:52.609> to<00:02:52.730> Colombia

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:53.180 
Colombia when we first moved to Colombia

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.750 
Colombia when we first moved to Colombia

I wasn't Mickey Jack diddly crap he's
making<00:02:56.060> very<00:02:56.170> very<00:02:57.170> little<00:02:57.409> money<00:02:57.530> with

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
making very very little money with

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.020 
making very very little money with
YouTube<00:02:58.129> and<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> was<00:02:58.400> actually<00:02:58.549> still<00:02:58.909> in<00:02:58.970> the

00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.030 
YouTube and I was actually still in the

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.960 
YouTube and I was actually still in the
process<00:02:59.180> from<00:02:59.920> looking<00:03:00.920> for<00:03:01.129> work<00:03:01.310> but<00:03:01.819> back

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
process from looking for work but back

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.759 
process from looking for work but back
then<00:03:02.209> things<00:03:02.450> were<00:03:02.599> very<00:03:02.629> different<00:03:03.139> in<00:03:03.500> fact

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
then things were very different in fact

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:05.949 
then things were very different in fact
there<00:03:03.920> was<00:03:04.040> actually<00:03:04.400> a<00:03:04.430> vlog<00:03:04.970> about

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
there was actually a vlog about

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.580 
there was actually a vlog about
budgeting<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.909> we<00:03:07.909> we<00:03:08.690> we<00:03:09.170> actually<00:03:09.440> never

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
budgeting and we we we actually never

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.710 
budgeting and we we we actually never
really<00:03:09.769> budgeted<00:03:10.340> instead<00:03:10.879> which<00:03:11.269> I<00:03:11.420> think

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
really budgeted instead which I think

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.360 
really budgeted instead which I think
was<00:03:11.870> actually<00:03:12.109> another<00:03:12.500> idea<00:03:12.799> we<00:03:12.920> just<00:03:12.950> didn't

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
was actually another idea we just didn't

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.839 
was actually another idea we just didn't
spend<00:03:13.730> money<00:03:14.060> you<00:03:14.329> know<00:03:14.900> ever<00:03:15.370> we<00:03:16.370> would<00:03:16.609> eat

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 
spend money you know ever we would eat

didn't spend you know very much money so

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.610 
didn't spend you know very much money so
that<00:03:55.099> has<00:03:55.459> just<00:03:56.049> we've<00:03:57.049> never<00:03:57.079> had<00:03:57.379> a<00:03:57.440> budget

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
that has just we've never had a budget

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.319 
that has just we've never had a budget
but<00:03:57.889> it's<00:03:58.010> just<00:03:58.159> become<00:03:58.609> looser<00:03:59.000> and<00:03:59.150> looser

00:03:59.319 --> 00:03:59.329 
but it's just become looser and looser

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:03.099 
but it's just become looser and looser
and<00:03:59.599> looser<00:03:59.780> and<00:04:00.139> now<00:04:01.010> I<00:04:01.040> feel<00:04:01.669> like<00:04:01.720> it's<00:04:02.720> I

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:03.109 
and looser and now I feel like it's I

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:04.750 
and looser and now I feel like it's I
don't<00:04:03.530> know<00:04:03.620> if<00:04:03.739> it's<00:04:03.859> almost<00:04:04.190> too<00:04:04.519> loose

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
don't know if it's almost too loose

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.379 
don't know if it's almost too loose
because<00:04:05.659> we<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.859> out<00:04:07.040> probably<00:04:07.849> more<00:04:08.000> often

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
because we go out probably more often

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:12.039 
because we go out probably more often
than<00:04:08.690> we<00:04:08.780> need<00:04:08.959> to<00:04:09.139> but<00:04:10.569> it's<00:04:11.569> just<00:04:11.690> something

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:22.330 
know that but I guess there's just some
times<00:04:20.900> where<00:04:21.260> you<00:04:21.650> know<00:04:21.739> I<00:04:21.769> can
