hello<00:00:00.570> we<00:00:00.810> are<00:00:00.960> talking<00:00:01.469> about<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:01.890> to

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
hello we are talking about how to

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.889 
hello we are talking about how to
install<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.700> fan<00:00:03.389> into<00:00:04.380> a<00:00:04.410> computer<00:00:05.899> it's

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
install a fan into a computer it's

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.330 
install a fan into a computer it's
really<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.230> simple<00:00:07.470> process<00:00:07.620> in<00:00:08.220> this

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
really a simple process in this

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.490 
really a simple process in this
particular<00:00:08.490> instance<00:00:08.900> this<00:00:09.900> is<00:00:10.080> an<00:00:10.170> older

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
particular instance this is an older

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.089 
particular instance this is an older
dell<00:00:10.710> model<00:00:11.059> and<00:00:12.410> dell<00:00:13.410> tends<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.799> have<00:00:13.950> these

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
dell model and dell tends to have these

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.410 
dell model and dell tends to have these
these<00:00:15.350> cases<00:00:16.350> pretty<00:00:16.560> much<00:00:16.680> built<00:00:17.090> to<00:00:18.090> spec<00:00:18.390> so

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
these cases pretty much built to spec so

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.950 
these cases pretty much built to spec so
they're<00:00:18.840> they're<00:00:19.140> really<00:00:19.439> simple<00:00:19.800> to<00:00:19.830> install

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
they're they're really simple to install

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.179 
they're they're really simple to install
there's<00:00:21.960> there's<00:00:22.230> other<00:00:22.380> fan<00:00:22.680> components

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
there's there's other fan components

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.220 
there's there's other fan components
that<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.310> can<00:00:23.490> install<00:00:23.779> some<00:00:24.779> cases<00:00:25.109> you<00:00:25.199> can

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
that you can install some cases you can

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.830 
that you can install some cases you can
put<00:00:25.560> one<00:00:26.490> or<00:00:26.609> more<00:00:26.730> case<00:00:26.970> fans<00:00:27.240> in<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.720> then

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
put one or more case fans in and then

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.570 
put one or more case fans in and then
obviously<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.830> processor<00:00:29.310> fans

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
obviously you have your processor fans

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.620 
obviously you have your processor fans
in<00:00:30.090> this<00:00:30.300> instance<00:00:31.309> this<00:00:32.309> particular<00:00:32.790> fan<00:00:33.329> is

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
in this instance this particular fan is

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.229 
in this instance this particular fan is
both<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.079> case<00:00:34.500> fan<00:00:34.860> and<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.489> processor<00:00:35.730> fan

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
both the case fan and a processor fan

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.549 
both the case fan and a processor fan
because<00:00:36.450> it<00:00:36.809> sits<00:00:37.020> right<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.230> front<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> the

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
because it sits right in front of the

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.700 
because it sits right in front of the
heatsink<00:00:37.950> for<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.190> processor<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.710> when

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
heatsink for the processor so when

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.260 
heatsink for the processor so when
you're<00:00:40.829> installing<00:00:41.010> it<00:00:41.399> they're<00:00:42.120> basically

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
you're installing it they're basically

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
you're installing it they're basically
two<00:00:42.660> considerations<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.770> keep<00:00:44.160> them<00:00:44.460> on

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
two considerations to keep them on

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.049 
two considerations to keep them on
number<00:00:45.270> one<00:00:45.480> is<00:00:45.750> how<00:00:45.989> does<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.559> fan<00:00:46.940> secure<00:00:47.940> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
number one is how does the fan secure to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.299 
number one is how does the fan secure to
the<00:00:48.090> case<00:00:48.450> and<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:49.500> instance<00:00:50.039> still

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the case and this instance still

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.880 
the case and this instance still
actually<00:00:50.520> has<00:00:50.879> this<00:00:51.180> housing<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.649> locks

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
actually has this housing that the locks

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.040 
actually has this housing that the locks
into<00:00:53.160> the<00:00:53.370> case<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:53.940> that<00:00:54.180> part<00:00:54.600> is<00:00:54.660> covered

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
into the case so that part is covered

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.389 
into the case so that part is covered
usually<00:00:55.530> though<00:00:55.710> if<00:00:55.890> you're<00:00:56.039> using<00:00:56.190> an

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
usually though if you're using an

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:59.959 
usually though if you're using an
aftermarket<00:00:56.879> fan<00:00:57.949> there'll<00:00:58.949> be<00:00:58.980> some<00:00:59.579> kind<00:00:59.910> of

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
aftermarket fan there'll be some kind of

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.970 
aftermarket fan there'll be some kind of
screws<00:01:00.329> we're<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.930> bolts<00:01:01.199> into<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.500> case<00:01:01.710> or

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
screws we're just bolts into the case or

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
screws we're just bolts into the case or
sometimes<00:01:02.370> they'll<00:01:02.520> have<00:01:02.699> some<00:01:03.690> little

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
sometimes they'll have some little

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.450 
sometimes they'll have some little
rubber<00:01:04.199> pieces<00:01:04.470> actually<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.070> just<00:01:05.220> pull

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
rubber pieces actually you just pull

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.280 
rubber pieces actually you just pull
through<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> holes<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.450> those<00:01:06.930> will<00:01:07.110> hold

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
through the holes and it those will hold

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.590 
through the holes and it those will hold
it<00:01:07.409> in<00:01:07.530> place<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:08.400> second<00:01:08.820> is<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.090> power<00:01:09.299> for

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
it in place the second is the power for

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.980 
it in place the second is the power for
the<00:01:09.630> fan<00:01:09.960> typically<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.189> a<00:01:11.400> four<00:01:11.850> port<00:01:12.180> are

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
the fan typically it's a four port are

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.760 
the fan typically it's a four port are
four<00:01:13.939> connector<00:01:14.939> hole<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:16.020> just<00:01:16.560> slides

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
four connector hole that just slides

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.710 
four connector hole that just slides
into<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.250> the<00:01:17.880> fan<00:01:18.119> power<00:01:18.390> on<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
into the the fan power on the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.380 
into the the fan power on the
motherboard<00:01:19.020> so<00:01:19.759> I'm<00:01:20.759> going<00:01:20.909> to<00:01:20.939> go<00:01:21.090> on<00:01:21.180> and

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
motherboard so I'm going to go on and

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.390 
motherboard so I'm going to go on and
install<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.229> you'll<00:01:22.619> see<00:01:22.830> exactly<00:01:22.920> how

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
install this and you'll see exactly how

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.560 
install this and you'll see exactly how
it's<00:01:23.610> done<00:01:24.619> first<00:01:25.619> let<00:01:25.770> us<00:01:25.799> suggest<00:01:26.570> in

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
it's done first let us suggest in

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350 
it's done first let us suggest in
securing<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> case<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:29.549> fan<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.329> the

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
securing the case or the the fan to the

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.490 
securing the case or the the fan to the
case<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:31.799> way<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.880> don't<00:01:33.110> you<00:01:34.110> don't<00:01:34.290> pull

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
case this way you don't you don't pull

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.690 
case this way you don't you don't pull
the<00:01:34.680> cable<00:01:35.009> while<00:01:35.130> you're<00:01:35.280> moving<00:01:35.400> it<00:01:35.610> around

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
the cable while you're moving it around

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.030 
the cable while you're moving it around
so<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.450> this<00:01:36.540> instance<00:01:36.600> it's<00:01:37.170> real<00:01:37.380> simple<00:01:37.560> it

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
so in this instance it's real simple it

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.370 
so in this instance it's real simple it
just<00:01:38.070> goes<00:01:39.000> in<00:01:39.270> and<00:01:39.509> then<00:01:39.600> slides<00:01:39.900> down<00:01:40.049> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
just goes in and then slides down and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.429 
just goes in and then slides down and
locks<00:01:40.530> in<00:01:40.680> place<00:01:41.150> and<00:01:42.150> then<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.479> connector<00:01:43.200> to

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
locks in place and then the connector to

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.889 
locks in place and then the connector to
the<00:01:43.470> motherboard<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.280> right<00:01:44.729> here<00:01:45.149> and

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
the motherboard is right here and

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:48.469 
the motherboard is right here and
typically<00:01:46.710> there's<00:01:46.920> a<00:01:46.979> there's<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.520> latch<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
typically there's a there's a latch it

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.530 
typically there's a there's a latch it
sits<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.899> the<00:01:49.020> top<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.530> the<00:01:49.799> connector<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.420> you

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
sits on the top of the connector and you

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.030 
sits on the top of the connector and you
just<00:01:51.720> line<00:01:51.930> that<00:01:51.960> up<00:01:52.200> with<00:01:52.590> where<00:01:52.799> it<00:01:52.890> goes<00:01:52.979> on

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
just line that up with where it goes on

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.280 
just line that up with where it goes on
the<00:01:53.369> motherboard<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.390> when<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.960> push<00:01:55.140> it

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
the motherboard and when you push it

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.100 
the motherboard and when you push it
down<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:56.070> click<00:01:56.369> into<00:01:56.640> place<00:01:57.110> and

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110

this<00:02:00.540> model<00:02:00.780> there's<00:02:01.079> a<00:02:01.140> heat<00:02:01.590> sink<00:02:01.770> right

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
this model there's a heat sink right
