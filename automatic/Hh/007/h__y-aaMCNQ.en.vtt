00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
 after a long absence are the 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.850
 charts are finally here again but me 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.610
 I must say this development appeals to me 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.300
 Not at all, I 'm mine too 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.040
 source vg chartpunkt com instructed and 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.199
 There was no one for weeks now 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.490
 charts update not only for 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.340
 germany but also for the others 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.920
 regions and that's why no 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.650
 bring video and the delay is mine 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 just too big I have to say there 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.800
 also like your opinion in the kombis 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.880
 while always the hardware 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.289
 play charts 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.020
 but I have to say we have it now 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:37.079
 In the middle of May and I present you the 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.210
 Charts from the end of march from 23 to 28 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.070
 march 2015 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.829
 I think that's a bit 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.500
 blatantly so my opinion is if 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.820
 the delay weiberheld or even 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.899
 worse it will be with the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.149
 be transportable 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.860
 as bad as it is, that should be 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.030
 better it goes on I would like it 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.079
 I would have done it gladly 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.670
 I made it regularly 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:00.949
 pulled through you can believe me but 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:03.270
 so it makes fun and still makes sense 

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:06.119
 your opinion in the combos we have to 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.130
 but watch the trend is yes 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.280
 Unfortunately rather in the negative pity 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.560
 just since I courage these charts 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.750
 do it really is that delay and 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.580
 which is getting worse otherwise they were 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.350
 always regularly all the years and now 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.330
 already they are seemingly demotivated like 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 also always seen at the moment 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.140
 Hardware charts did not do much 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.970
 done no changes and the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.610
 software for one thing we have one 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 newcomer platform on the one of the 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.700
 another in fifth place 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.549
 newcomers with borderlands the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:39.210
 handsome collection and there is 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.720
 the xbox wii version on place 22 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.670
 which I also find very suspicious that me 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.750
 many new games crept in 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.799
 have been on the market for some time 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.729
 and that it is so 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.670
 mine so you see you watchdog 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.969
 little big planet 3 and wolfenstein the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.610
 new order that three games at the 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.780
 not yet the previous week's charts 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.460
 times in the top 5 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.170
 So, I could not even 70 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.970
 determine and which place the verdi 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.810
 were this is very unusual for 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.550
 my concepts 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.160
 I do not know what I mean by the 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.110
 but you should keep charts 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.150
 See that is that the charts are predominantly 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.890
 consist of ps four titles and that's why 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.200
 the nintendo charts are also very 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.280
 interesting there are the top 3 so the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.940
 top steppe climber like 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 one likes to 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.830
 these are still mario party 10 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.290
 zelda majora's mask 3d and pokÃ©mon mega 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.209
 open and alpha sapphire then comes the 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.440
 Kracher in fourth place, super 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.970
 mario bros wii 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.570
 in the week of 280 what should I do with it 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.820
 hold 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.489
 new super mario bros wii is that 

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:46.730
 fourth best sold games on one 

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:50.970
 nintendo console in said 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:53.489
 march week in 2015 so the game 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:56.310
 Alright , I can not say anything yet 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:03:00.180
 but can not imagine that 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.130
 also mario party 9 and justin 2015 are 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.780
 good at doing well you have to say in each one 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 Well stocked electro shop then 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.690
 everywhere the wii play the like 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.910
 classical games are also very 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.049
 cheap and every kind newey and there can 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.030
 you will also get to access or ever 

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:13.590
 I am surprised that very much me 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.030
 my where is a mario kart eight 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.560
 For example, it does not fit in the top 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.810
 and smash brothers 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.880
 relegated 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.920
 very strange something with the charts 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.860
 So we are also content 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.110
 have to look like that in the near 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.280
 future developed so now I want to do 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:31.200
 do not pull so long because it stops too 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.090
 you have to say outdated is there 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.980
 I can take place after your criticism 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.840
 I do not understand , maybe that's it 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:40.470
 the last batch video or it comes 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.590
 promptly come new information really 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.440
 we have to keep that in mind 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.090
 if not his shot but that it 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.769
 continues on the spot until the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.769
 next time better monschau
