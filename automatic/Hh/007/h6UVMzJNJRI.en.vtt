00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
10 yeah just just over the top of the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.390 
10 yeah just just over the top of the
ship<00:03:24.269> a<00:03:24.510> few<00:03:24.750> kilometers<00:03:25.260> north<00:03:26.040> of<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.250> wreck

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
ship a few kilometers north of the wreck

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.690 
ship a few kilometers north of the wreck
might<00:03:26.640> be<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:26.819> little<00:03:27.000> or<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.239> little<00:03:27.569> overkill

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
might be a little or a little overkill

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.740 
might be a little or a little overkill
it's<00:03:29.700> not<00:03:29.970> what<00:03:30.180> I<00:03:30.209> meant

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
it's not what I meant

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.539 
it's not what I meant
um<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.200> guys<00:03:31.350> know<00:03:31.680> it<00:03:31.860> the<00:03:32.160> ship<00:03:32.370> was

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
um you guys know it the ship was

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:34.699 
um you guys know it the ship was
completely<00:03:32.790> empty<00:03:33.180> when<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.540> was<00:03:33.630> sunk<00:03:33.840> of

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
completely empty when it was sunk of

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.910 
completely empty when it was sunk of
people<00:03:35.459> and<00:03:36.299> presumably<00:03:36.810> any<00:03:37.440> valuable

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:37.920 
people and presumably any valuable

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.360 
people and presumably any valuable
technology<00:03:38.250> unless<00:03:38.850> the<00:03:39.239> Navy<00:03:39.450> is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:40.340> was<00:03:41.340> a

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
technology unless the Navy is a was a

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.770 
technology unless the Navy is a was a
little<00:03:41.609> more<00:03:41.760> wasteful<00:03:42.120> at<00:03:42.209> the<00:03:42.299> time<00:03:42.450> I<00:03:42.480> can't

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
little more wasteful at the time I can't

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.380 
little more wasteful at the time I can't
confirm<00:03:43.079> that<00:03:43.109> but<00:03:43.290> um<00:03:43.970> sorry<00:03:44.970> I<00:03:45.060> shouldn't

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
confirm that but um sorry I shouldn't

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.180 
confirm that but um sorry I shouldn't
speculate<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:46.170> that<00:03:46.380> but<00:03:46.560> it<00:03:46.650> was<00:03:46.680> free<00:03:47.100> of

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
speculate like that but it was free of

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.650 
speculate like that but it was free of
people<00:03:47.519> there<00:03:47.640> were<00:03:47.730> no<00:03:47.880> people<00:03:48.060> on<00:03:48.390> the<00:03:48.510> wreck

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
people there were no people on the wreck

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.770 
people there were no people on the wreck
