know you gotta you gotta research it
yourself<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.850> got<00:02:12.000> to<00:02:12.090> figure<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.420> out<00:02:12.480> what

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
if you spend the time to research it you

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:30.410 
if you spend the time to research it you
could<00:02:28.230> say<00:02:28.380> well<00:02:28.590> maybe<00:02:28.920> it<00:02:29.610> isn't<00:02:29.790> that<00:02:30.150> maybe

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
could say well maybe it isn't that maybe

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.090 
could say well maybe it isn't that maybe
it's<00:02:30.660> this<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.230> then<00:02:31.320> he<00:02:31.440> could<00:02:31.590> realize<00:02:31.890> all

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:32.100 
it's this and then he could realize all

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.740 
it's this and then he could realize all
your<00:02:32.130> right<00:02:32.370> never<00:02:32.940> seen<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.180> before<00:02:33.330> look
