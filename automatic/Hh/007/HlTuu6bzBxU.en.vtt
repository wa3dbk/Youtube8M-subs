beachy<00:00:08.740> waves<00:00:08.950> just<00:00:09.700> by<00:00:09.820> putting<00:00:10.150> a<00:00:10.270> couple

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
beachy waves just by putting a couple

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.270 
beachy waves just by putting a couple
braids<00:00:10.780> in<00:00:10.990> your<00:00:11.110> hair<00:00:11.320> and<00:00:11.590> using<00:00:11.920> your<00:00:12.100> flat

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
braids in your hair and using your flat

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:13.980 
braids in your hair and using your flat
iron<00:00:12.549> so<00:00:13.180> let's<00:00:13.330> get<00:00:13.420> started

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:13.990 
iron so let's get started

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.410 
iron so let's get started
I<00:00:14.020> don't<00:00:14.740> flatten<00:00:15.219> your<00:00:15.490> hair<00:00:15.760> or<00:00:16.029> brush<00:00:16.240> it

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:16.420 
I don't flatten your hair or brush it

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.630 
I don't flatten your hair or brush it
out<00:00:16.570> stick<00:00:17.050> with<00:00:17.230> its<00:00:17.529> natural<00:00:17.949> texture<00:00:18.430> if

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:18.640 
out stick with its natural texture if

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.830 
out stick with its natural texture if
you<00:00:18.699> have<00:00:18.880> any<00:00:19.000> wave<00:00:19.240> just<00:00:19.480> leave<00:00:19.690> it<00:00:19.810> like

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:19.840 
you have any wave just leave it like

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:22.500 
you have any wave just leave it like
that<00:00:19.990> and<00:00:20.320> work<00:00:20.500> with<00:00:20.530> it<00:00:20.890> so<00:00:21.100> I<00:00:21.580> just<00:00:21.850> loosely

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:22.510 
that and work with it so I just loosely

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.260 
that and work with it so I just loosely
divide<00:00:23.410> your<00:00:23.680> hair<00:00:23.980> into<00:00:24.120> three<00:00:25.120> or<00:00:25.210> four

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:25.270 
divide your hair into three or four

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:32.670 
divide your hair into three or four
sections<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:28.230> then<00:00:29.230> braid<00:00:29.470> away<00:00:31.259> the<00:00:32.259> larger

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:32.680 
sections and then braid away the larger

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.290 
sections and then braid away the larger
you<00:00:32.829> make<00:00:33.039> the<00:00:33.219> braid<00:00:33.460> the<00:00:33.789> bigger<00:00:33.969> the<00:00:34.120> waves

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
you make the braid the bigger the waves

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.930 
you make the braid the bigger the waves
will<00:00:34.510> be<00:00:34.629> so<00:00:34.960> don't<00:00:35.260> do<00:00:35.410> tiny<00:00:35.680> little<00:00:36.040> braids

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
will be so don't do tiny little braids

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.580 
will be so don't do tiny little braids
because<00:00:37.270> it'll<00:00:37.660> end<00:00:37.870> up<00:00:37.930> looking<00:00:37.989> more<00:00:38.440> like<00:00:38.560> a

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.590 
because it'll end up looking more like a

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.330 
because it'll end up looking more like a
crimp<00:00:39.010> than<00:00:39.280> a<00:00:39.610> nice<00:00:40.540> sort<00:00:40.780> of<00:00:40.810> texture<00:00:41.340> so

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
crimp than a nice sort of texture so

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.160 
crimp than a nice sort of texture so
braid<00:00:42.550> all<00:00:42.790> the<00:00:42.820> way<00:00:42.910> down<00:00:43.030> they<00:00:43.899> don't<00:00:44.079> need

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.170 
braid all the way down they don't need

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.450 
braid all the way down they don't need
to<00:00:44.290> be<00:00:44.380> perfect<00:00:44.770> at<00:00:44.890> all<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.860> then<00:00:47.860> secure<00:00:48.370> in

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
to be perfect at all and then secure in

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.620 
to be perfect at all and then secure in
place<00:00:48.489> with<00:00:48.730> a<00:00:49.690> little<00:00:49.780> elastic<00:00:51.300> great<00:00:52.300> so<00:00:52.510> now

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:52.630 
place with a little elastic great so now

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:56.010 
place with a little elastic great so now
you<00:00:52.690> have<00:00:52.899> all<00:00:52.930> your<00:00:53.230> hair<00:00:53.530> in<00:00:53.910> braids<00:00:54.910> and<00:00:55.360> I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.020 
you have all your hair in braids and I

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.450 
you have all your hair in braids and I
like<00:00:56.200> to<00:00:56.320> spray<00:00:56.649> it<00:00:56.800> with<00:00:56.950> a<00:00:57.010> bit<00:00:57.219> of<00:00:57.280> hairspray

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
like to spray it with a bit of hairspray

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.479 
like to spray it with a bit of hairspray
before<00:00:57.820> flatiron<00:00:58.570> just<00:00:58.960> so<00:00:59.110> that<00:00:59.290> it<00:00:59.920> has<00:01:00.130> a

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:00.489 
before flatiron just so that it has a

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:02.970 
before flatiron just so that it has a
little<00:01:00.790> something<00:01:01.059> to<00:01:01.149> hold<00:01:01.239> on<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.710> your

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
little something to hold on to as your

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:12.840 
little something to hold on to as your
spring<00:01:09.030> perfect<00:01:10.030> and<00:01:10.959> then<00:01:11.319> you<00:01:11.889> start<00:01:12.249> by

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
spring perfect and then you start by

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.330 
spring perfect and then you start by
taking<00:01:13.030> your<00:01:13.209> flat<00:01:13.479> iron<00:01:13.719> and<00:01:14.219> running<00:01:15.219> it

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
taking your flat iron and running it

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.459 
taking your flat iron and running it
down<00:01:15.369> the<00:01:16.319> length<00:01:17.319> of<00:01:17.499> your<00:01:17.590> braid<00:01:17.859> and<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:20.079> just

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:20.469 
down the length of your braid and I just

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:22.199 
down the length of your braid and I just
like<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.740> do<00:01:20.859> it<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:20.979> couple<00:01:21.189> times<00:01:21.459> but<00:01:21.999> don't

00:01:22.199 --> 00:01:22.209 
like to do it a couple times but don't

00:01:22.209 --> 00:01:24.300 
like to do it a couple times but don't
hold<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.600> heat<00:01:22.810> in<00:01:23.079> place<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.679> too<00:01:23.859> too<00:01:24.069> long

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
hold the heat in place for too too long

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.800 
hold the heat in place for too too long
at<00:01:25.149> once<00:01:25.420> so<00:01:25.630> you<00:01:25.689> don't<00:01:25.840> damage<00:01:26.049> the<00:01:26.319> hair<00:01:27.810> and

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
at once so you don't damage the hair and

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.459 
at once so you don't damage the hair and
then<00:01:29.109> again<00:01:29.409> do<00:01:29.709> it<00:01:29.740> with<00:01:29.889> the<00:01:29.979> next<00:01:30.310> one<00:01:31.469> so

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
then again do it with the next one so

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:35.069 
then again do it with the next one so
you're<00:01:32.590> just<00:01:32.770> running<00:01:32.979> it<00:01:33.189> down<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.869> length

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
you're just running it down the length

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.319 
you're just running it down the length
of<00:01:35.349> the<00:01:35.469> braid<00:01:35.679> a<00:01:35.709> couple<00:01:35.799> times<00:01:36.329> and

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
of the braid a couple times and

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.760 
of the braid a couple times and
basically<00:01:37.659> you're<00:01:38.229> just<00:01:40.349> get<00:01:41.349> it<00:01:41.439> to<00:01:41.529> place

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
basically you're just get it to place

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:43.469 
basically you're just get it to place
using<00:01:42.219> that<00:01:42.429> braid<00:01:42.729> I<00:01:42.759> sort<00:01:43.090> of<00:01:43.119> it's<00:01:43.270> going

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
using that braid I sort of it's going

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:44.819 
using that braid I sort of it's going
great<00:01:43.719> so<00:01:43.810> now<00:01:44.079> you've<00:01:44.259> taken<00:01:44.439> out<00:01:44.649> all<00:01:44.799> of

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:44.829 
great so now you've taken out all of

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.459 
great so now you've taken out all of
your<00:01:45.279> braids<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.389> if<00:01:46.869> you<00:01:46.990> find<00:01:47.139> there's<00:01:47.319> any

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
your braids and if you find there's any

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.139 
your braids and if you find there's any
parts<00:01:47.859> that<00:01:48.009> feel<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.189> bit<00:01:48.340> flat<00:01:48.639> or<00:01:48.909> don't<00:01:49.090> have

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:49.149 
parts that feel a bit flat or don't have

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:51.870 
parts that feel a bit flat or don't have
enough<00:01:49.209> volume<00:01:49.810> I<00:01:50.020> just<00:01:50.590> like<00:01:50.709> to<00:01:50.859> take<00:01:51.099> small

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
enough volume I just like to take small

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.749 
enough volume I just like to take small
sections<00:01:52.419> of<00:01:52.539> the<00:01:52.659> hair<00:01:52.810> just<00:01:53.590> like<00:01:53.859> this<00:01:54.249> and

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
sections of the hair just like this and

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.089 
sections of the hair just like this and
then<00:01:55.359> loop<00:01:55.929> it<00:01:56.049> around<00:01:56.139> the<00:01:56.380> fingers<00:01:56.679> a<00:01:56.709> couple

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
then loop it around the fingers a couple

00:01:57.099 --> 00:01:58.769 
then loop it around the fingers a couple
times<00:01:57.340> just<00:01:57.639> so<00:01:57.849> you<00:01:57.999> have<00:01:58.119> a<00:01:58.149> nice<00:01:58.329> loop<00:01:58.599> like

00:01:58.769 --> 00:01:58.779 
times just so you have a nice loop like

00:01:58.779 --> 00:02:02.699 
times just so you have a nice loop like
that<00:01:58.979> clamp<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.130> between<00:02:00.219> the<00:02:00.849> two<00:02:01.499> the<00:02:02.499> flat

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:02.709 
that clamp it between the two the flat

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.379 
that clamp it between the two the flat
iron<00:02:02.919> here<00:02:03.279> so<00:02:03.789> you're<00:02:03.880> just<00:02:03.939> gonna<00:02:04.060> hold<00:02:04.299> it

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:04.389 
iron here so you're just gonna hold it

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:06.059 
iron here so you're just gonna hold it
like<00:02:04.539> that<00:02:04.659> for<00:02:04.840> just<00:02:04.929> a<00:02:05.079> couple<00:02:05.229> seconds<00:02:05.829> and
