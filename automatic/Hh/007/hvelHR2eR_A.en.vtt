00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
one so closely that no one would really

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.389 
one so closely that no one would really
know<00:01:49.409> what's<00:01:49.590> in<00:01:49.710> it<00:01:49.740> except<00:01:50.040> for<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.220> chef

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
that makes it so this should take you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.819 
that makes it so this should take you
about<00:01:54.270> another<00:01:54.420> 20<00:01:55.140> seconds<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.590> sort<00:01:55.770> of

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
about another 20 seconds to sort of

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.160 
about another 20 seconds to sort of
thicken<00:01:56.100> up<00:01:56.270> and<00:01:57.270> also<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.719> wouldn't<00:01:57.899> recommend

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
thicken up and also I wouldn't recommend

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.690 
thicken up and also I wouldn't recommend
using<00:01:58.409> frozen<00:01:58.740> spinach<00:01:59.040> either<00:01:59.399> because

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
using frozen spinach either because

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.310 
using frozen spinach either because
frozen<00:02:00.090> spinach<00:02:00.240> all<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.780> moisture<00:02:01.049> is<00:02:01.110> gonna

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
frozen spinach all the moisture is gonna

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.170 
frozen spinach all the moisture is gonna
fall<00:02:01.500> right<00:02:01.649> out<00:02:01.770> of<00:02:01.860> it<00:02:01.979> and<00:02:02.159> your<00:02:02.310> it'll<00:02:02.759> if

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
fall right out of it and your it'll if

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.459 
fall right out of it and your it'll if
you're<00:02:03.299> gonna<00:02:03.390> use<00:02:03.570> frozen<00:02:03.960> spinach<00:02:04.110> you<00:02:04.350> may

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
you're gonna use frozen spinach you may

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.690 
you're gonna use frozen spinach you may
as<00:02:04.530> well<00:02:04.590> use<00:02:04.680> the<00:02:04.950> roux<00:02:05.070> to<00:02:05.100> thicken<00:02:05.280> it<00:02:05.579> up

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
as well use the roux to thicken it up

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.280 
as well use the roux to thicken it up
and<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> want<00:02:06.689> to<00:02:06.750> make<00:02:06.840> sure<00:02:06.869> it's<00:02:07.110> almost

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
and you want to make sure it's almost

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.570 
and you want to make sure it's almost
like<00:02:07.469> a<00:02:07.530> paste<00:02:07.740> before<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> get<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.280> Spanish

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
like a paste before you get the Spanish

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:09.770 
like a paste before you get the Spanish
to<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.789> too<00:02:08.910> so<00:02:09.030> much<00:02:09.119> water<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.479> gonna<00:02:09.629> come

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
to it too so much water is gonna come

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:21.860 
to it too so much water is gonna come
out<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.989> it

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.520 

all<00:02:22.870> right<00:02:22.990> so<00:02:23.110> I'm<00:02:23.170> gonna<00:02:23.260> make<00:02:23.380> one<00:02:23.500> more

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
all right so I'm gonna make one more

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:33.210 
all right so I'm gonna make one more
pass<00:02:23.650> with<00:02:24.069> a<00:02:24.100> salt<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.370> pepper<00:02:31.740> and<00:02:32.740> you<00:02:33.100> can

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
pass with a salt and pepper and you can

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:34.920 
pass with a salt and pepper and you can
tell<00:02:33.370> now<00:02:33.520> how<00:02:33.910> it's<00:02:34.060> not<00:02:34.150> bubbling<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.750> its

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
tell now how it's not bubbling up its

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:38.660 
tell now how it's not bubbling up its
kind<00:02:35.080> of<00:02:35.140> bubbling<00:02:35.410> down<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.970> we<00:02:37.600> are<00:02:37.690> going

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
kind of bubbling down that we are going

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.150 
kind of bubbling down that we are going
to<00:02:39.670> see<00:02:39.760> the<00:02:39.850> consistency<00:02:40.150> there<00:02:40.950> nice<00:02:41.950> and

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.160 
to see the consistency there nice and

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.210 
to see the consistency there nice and
thick<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:46.410> as<00:02:47.410> that<00:02:47.560> cools<00:02:47.800> I<00:02:47.950> will<00:02:48.070> pick<00:02:48.190> it

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
thick and as that cools I will pick it

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.620 
thick and as that cools I will pick it
up<00:02:48.430> too<00:02:48.550> because<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.970> cheese<00:02:49.180> it's<00:02:49.390> in<00:02:49.510> there

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:49.630 
up too because the cheese it's in there

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.340 
up too because the cheese it's in there
so<00:02:50.500> let's<00:02:50.650> move<00:02:50.800> on<00:02:50.950> to<00:02:51.130> our<00:02:52.170> throwing<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:53.290> in

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
so let's move on to our throwing them in

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.860 
so let's move on to our throwing them in
the<00:02:53.380> oven<00:02:53.530> stage
