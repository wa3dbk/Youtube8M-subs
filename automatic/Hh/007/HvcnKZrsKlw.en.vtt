 any problem there 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.149
 the problem of you consume beer and 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.250
 an appetizer regularly almost every 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.940
 days is very caloric and with few 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.070
 nutrients 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.260

 ingesting less nutrients as you have 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.789
 a nice limitation over the course of the day 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.590
 It's so much a problem now, I'm sure. 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.870
 if you decrease the frequency of these 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.550
 beers and aperitifs would take place 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:06.090
 with a better result

 a little more fat 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.290
