00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
fit in five people but I'm guessing for

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.330

could guess this is probably gonna cost
like<00:01:53.100> a<00:01:53.220> million<00:01:53.670> dollars<00:01:54.030> so<00:01:54.299> that's<00:01:54.930> gonna

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
like a million dollars so that's gonna

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.859 
like a million dollars so that's gonna
