what we got here are usually disorder
there<00:00:17.760> simply<00:00:18.449> because<00:00:18.570> it's<00:00:19.050> quicker<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
there simply because it's quicker and

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.700 
there simply because it's quicker and
easier<00:00:19.770> than<00:00:20.460> a<00:00:20.970> lot<00:00:21.510> cheaper<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.930> well<00:00:22.080> then

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
easier than a lot cheaper as well then

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.429 
easier than a lot cheaper as well then
going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> my<00:00:23.160> local<00:00:23.369> pet<00:00:23.609> store<00:00:25.130> alright<00:00:26.150> so

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
going to my local pet store alright so

going to my local pet store alright so
we've<00:00:28.439> got<00:00:28.650> three<00:00:28.890> containers<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.849> the<00:00:30.449> red

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
we've got three containers of the red

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.380 
we've got three containers of the red
shrimp<00:00:31.070> this<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.279> krill<00:00:32.610> will<00:00:32.910> actually

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
shrimp this in krill will actually

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.280 
shrimp this in krill will actually
increase<00:00:34.160> yellows<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.300> reds<00:00:36.300> in<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.660> turtles

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
increase yellows and reds in the turtles

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.729 
increase yellows and reds in the turtles
up<00:00:37.559> skin<00:00:38.340> only<00:00:38.550> not<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.000> shell<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:39.660> all<00:00:39.780> due<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
up skin only not the shell at all due to

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.920 
up skin only not the shell at all due to
the<00:00:40.980> carrots<00:00:41.820> and<00:00:41.969> i<00:00:42.030> believe<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.360> is<00:00:42.480> with

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
the carrots and i believe it is with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.010 
the carrots and i believe it is with
inside<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.559> animal<00:00:43.890> that<00:00:44.160> well<00:00:45.090> the<00:00:45.750> shriller

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
inside the animal that well the shriller

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.850 
inside the animal that well the shriller
the<00:00:46.230> crib<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.930> krill<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.260> shrimp<00:00:49.530> there<00:00:49.770> we

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
the crib so krill or the shrimp there we

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.590 
the crib so krill or the shrimp there we
go<00:00:49.980> yeah<00:00:50.969> so<00:00:51.960> that's<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:54.199> the<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
go yeah so that's that the other one and

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.090 
go yeah so that's that the other one and
find<00:00:57.600> one<00:00:57.780> here<00:01:00.469> we've<00:01:01.469> got<00:01:01.550> Hikari<00:01:02.550> koi<00:01:03.030> food

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
find one here we've got Hikari koi food

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.580 
find one here we've got Hikari koi food
what<00:01:05.100> this<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.670> is<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.659> wheat<00:01:06.869> germ<00:01:07.170> pellet

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
what this is is it's a wheat germ pellet

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.179 
what this is is it's a wheat germ pellet
that<00:01:08.510> has<00:01:09.510> a<00:01:09.540> very<00:01:09.810> low<00:01:10.020> protein<00:01:10.350> count<00:01:10.799> it's

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
that has a very low protein count it's

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.100 
that has a very low protein count it's
better<00:01:12.119> for<00:01:12.720> your<00:01:13.260> adult<00:01:13.619> species<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.400> turtles

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.110 
better for your adult species of turtles

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.080 
better for your adult species of turtles
it's<00:01:16.110> also<00:01:16.409> very<00:01:16.799> good<00:01:17.070> to<00:01:17.220> throw<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.640> in<00:01:17.880> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
it's also very good to throw this in as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.520 
it's also very good to throw this in as
variety<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:19.680> won't<00:01:20.580> create<00:01:21.530> pyramiding

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
variety it won't create pyramiding

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.480 
variety it won't create pyramiding
within<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:22.830> shell<00:01:23.450> shouldn't<00:01:24.450> say<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.720> but

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
within the shell shouldn't say that but

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.310 
within the shell shouldn't say that but
obviously<00:01:26.490> overfeeding<00:01:27.270> will<00:01:27.479> create

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
obviously overfeeding will create

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.520 
obviously overfeeding will create
pyramiding<00:01:28.829> it's<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.880> typical<00:01:30.210> like<00:01:30.810> Rep

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
pyramiding it's the typical like Rep

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.429 
pyramiding it's the typical like Rep
dhiman<00:01:32.540> foods<00:01:33.540> like<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.140> are<00:01:34.170> such

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
dhiman foods like that that are such

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.940 
dhiman foods like that that are such
high<00:01:34.619> in<00:01:34.740> protein<00:01:34.950> thirty-five<00:01:35.759> percent<00:01:35.970> up

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
high in protein thirty-five percent up

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.359 
high in protein thirty-five percent up
that<00:01:37.950> will<00:01:38.159> create<00:01:38.520> your<00:01:39.020> issues<00:01:40.020> there<00:01:40.369> your

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that will create your issues there your

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.880 
that will create your issues there your
crude<00:01:41.579> protein<00:01:41.850> games<00:01:42.240> 32<00:01:42.659> but<00:01:43.409> it's<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.710> far

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
crude protein games 32 but it's a far

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.160 
crude protein games 32 but it's a far
better<00:01:44.070> staple<00:01:44.820> than<00:01:45.240> most<00:01:46.140> other<00:01:46.380> fruits

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170

here we've got sinking sticks now it's I

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.550 
here we've got sinking sticks now it's I
like<00:01:53.909> it<00:01:54.060> for<00:01:54.210> my<00:01:54.329> Musk's<00:01:54.810> that<00:01:55.049> don't<00:01:55.229> like<00:01:55.409> to

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
feed on the top and then we got a bigger

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.610 
feed on the top and then we got a bigger
bag<00:02:00.360> of<00:02:00.600> it
