 [Music] 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.190
 I will prepare a fennel cream with 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.559
 spelled is the oldest wheat 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.480
 cultivated by man, there are traces of it 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.060
 from 5 thousand forward christ 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.670
 the ingredients for 4 people are one 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.940
 fennel a potato a small onion 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.730
 extra virgin olive oil salt, pepper and 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.040
 150 grams of spelled the tools of 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.260
 cooking we're going to use for 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.570
 this recipe is a pan and a 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:37.079
 first casserole 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.079
 we prepare fennel we deprive it 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.769
 of the hardest outer coasts 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.890
 in this way so we keep the parts a 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:48.329
 a little more tender and so we cut it 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.449
 in half 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.909
 then with a knife 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.269
 this is the name of the knife e 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:58.620
 we are going to do it in julienne style 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.739
 very fine 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 now the finer we prepare it the faster 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:08.490
 will be cooking the same operation 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.450
 we do it with the onion very well 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.280
 then we clean the da cut in half and 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:20.630
 here is the important julien again 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.630
 cut it very fine 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:29.340
 we admit aloof as we have 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:33.000
 made with fennel and let's go to 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 prepare the potato now the potato 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.850
 you must peel it, if possible, wash it 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.310
 before blossoming 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:48.420
 after that we have to make cubes 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:50.820
 we cut into various sizes and create gods 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.760
 cubes this is not very important 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:56.340
 the speech of the rectangle cube 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.800
 triangle or hexagon the important thing is 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:02.130
 create small pieces because 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.800
 when we are going to whisk it will be a lot 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.190
 simpler and will become much more 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:11.190
 our soup is creamy in a pan 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 let's put extra virgin olive oil 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.310
 olive 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.530
 Let's start immediately with the onion 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:26.270
 this is the sizzle that must be 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:29.739
 feel to understand that the oil is hot and 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.739
 which starts to brown the onion 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:48.350
 we follow with fennel and now 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:50.750
 we put the potato we bring to 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:52.420
 boil a saucepan of water 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.950
 salt 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:02.840
 let's go and put some of this water 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:06.049
 in the pan and in the meantime we go to 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:13.180
 cook in the remaining water we go 

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:13.180
 cook the do it this way 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:21.320
 the water is salty we put the lighthouse 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:25.280
 let's turn to let the spelled cook for 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:29.390
 about 30 35 minutes and it's just the time 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:32.799
 which we need to cook the 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.799
 fennel with potatoes 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:40.299
 then here in the casserole we have the 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:46.510
 fennel and cooked potatoes 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:51.010
 let's go to put out the fire and bring 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:56.870
 all in a high-sided pan 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:04:02.810
 very well perfect so then we take the 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:05.360
 blender and whisk until you get it 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.390
 a beautiful cream must be right 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:14.060
 homogeneous must not be pieces 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:17.959
 and nothing but just beautiful creamy perfect 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.229
 as you can see, some splashes so you need to 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.550
 to use these pots 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:31.520
 high edges 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:35.360
 let's go back to the pan and add it to 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:38.240
 at this point we are going to drain the spelled 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.340
 that by now it will be cooked and that 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:46.520
 previously we will also have checked 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:53.030
 the right amount of salt 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:59.630
 we put the spelled with the cream of 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:05:03.889
 fennel, we're all good together 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:07.580
 let the spelled be well mixed with 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:14.410
 cream when everything is well 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.410
 when mixed together, add salt and pepper 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:25.530
 well 

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:29.220
 and we are going to implant it in a holster 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.220
 slightly flared 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:42.050
 well planted so we could decorate 

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:48.140
 with tuft of parsley e 

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:51.140
 of the excellent extra virgin olive oil ed 

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.630
 here is our fennel cream with 

00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:56.430
 spelled is an ideal dish for the 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:06:07.779
 autumn and winter evenings 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:07.779
