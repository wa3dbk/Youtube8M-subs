00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
felt like should be recorded on some

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.910 
felt like should be recorded on some
sort<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.150> recording<00:00:09.660> device<00:00:09.719> and<00:00:10.469> don't

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
sort of recording device and don't

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.249 
sort of recording device and don't
expect<00:00:11.370> anything<00:00:11.730> like<00:00:12.210> profound<00:00:12.900> or

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
expect anything like profound or

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.740 
expect anything like profound or
life-changing<00:00:14.130> cuz<00:00:14.370> today<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.880> like<00:00:15.120> not<00:00:15.509> the

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
life-changing cuz today is like not the

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.359 
life-changing cuz today is like not the
day<00:00:15.929> for<00:00:15.960> that<00:00:16.379> I<00:00:16.650> was<00:00:16.830> just<00:00:16.920> having<00:00:17.160> all<00:00:17.250> these

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
day for that I was just having all these

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.580 
day for that I was just having all these
pond'rous<00:00:17.880> thoughts<00:00:18.090> and<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.420> was<00:00:18.570> like<00:00:18.779> my<00:00:19.140> V<00:00:19.560> I

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
pond'rous thoughts and I was like my V I

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.890 
pond'rous thoughts and I was like my V I
should<00:00:19.980> put<00:00:20.130> some<00:00:20.160> on<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.460> camera<00:00:20.730> and<00:00:21.090> maybe<00:00:21.630> my

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
should put some on a camera and maybe my

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.000 
should put some on a camera and maybe my
nose<00:00:21.960> should<00:00:22.320> stop<00:00:22.560> running

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
nose should stop running

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.429 
nose should stop running
that'd<00:00:23.160> be<00:00:23.189> great<00:00:23.609> -<00:00:24.000> I<00:00:24.359> would<00:00:24.990> love<00:00:25.109> that<00:00:25.170> I

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
that'd be great - I would love that I

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.019 
that'd be great - I would love that I
was<00:00:25.560> looking<00:00:25.800> around<00:00:25.830> in<00:00:26.099> chemistry<00:00:26.580> chai<00:00:26.760> and

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
was looking around in chemistry chai and

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
was looking around in chemistry chai and
I<00:00:27.150> basically<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.869> wasn't<00:00:28.199> doing<00:00:28.439> chemistry

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
I basically I wasn't doing chemistry

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.500 
I basically I wasn't doing chemistry
because<00:00:29.189> chemistry<00:00:29.550> was<00:00:29.760> complicated

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
because chemistry was complicated

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.690 
because chemistry was complicated
I<00:00:30.630> keep<00:00:31.260> thinking<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.710> I<00:00:31.830> can<00:00:32.009> do<00:00:32.130> it<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.399> I'm

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
I keep thinking that I can do it and I'm

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.610 
I keep thinking that I can do it and I'm
wrong<00:00:33.059> I<00:00:33.390> was<00:00:33.719> looking<00:00:33.930> around<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.170> chemistry

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
wrong I was looking around in chemistry

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.959 
wrong I was looking around in chemistry
and<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.100> was<00:00:35.190> looking<00:00:35.399> at<00:00:35.460> all<00:00:35.520> these<00:00:35.640> people

pondering people looking old and then I

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.319 
pondering people looking old and then I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
in this class are not gonna get to being

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.080 
in this class are not gonna get to being
old<00:00:58.410> because<00:00:58.800> they're<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.039> die<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.000> we

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
unexpected and everyone just sort of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.580 
unexpected and everyone just sort of
moved<00:01:06.360> on<00:01:06.540> with<00:01:06.750> life<00:01:06.930> like<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.290> wasn't<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.560> big

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
moved on with life like it wasn't a big

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.859 
moved on with life like it wasn't a big
deal<00:01:07.950> like<00:01:08.400> there<00:01:08.700> was<00:01:08.820> like<00:01:09.000> stuff<00:01:09.390> about<00:01:09.659> it

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
but everyone just moved on and it was

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:12.980 
but everyone just moved on and it was
really<00:01:12.060> weird<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.420> they<00:01:12.630> just<00:01:12.780> announced

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
really weird and they just announced

moved on but anyways so I was thinking
about<00:01:18.479> death<00:01:18.810> which<00:01:19.530> is<00:01:19.740> kind<00:01:19.979> of<00:01:20.070> morbid<00:01:20.280> but

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
about death which is kind of morbid but

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
about death which is kind of morbid but
like<00:01:20.850> I<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.270> a<00:01:21.299> really<00:01:21.509> weird<00:01:21.659> relationship

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
like I have a really weird relationship

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.630 
like I have a really weird relationship
with<00:01:22.439> death<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:22.979> a<00:01:23.009> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.189> people<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.549> my

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
with death because a lot of people in my

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.429 
with death because a lot of people in my
life<00:01:23.820> have<00:01:24.000> died<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.930> haven't<00:01:25.140> been<00:01:25.290> too

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
life have died and I haven't been too

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.469 
life have died and I haven't been too
worried<00:01:25.680> about<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.920> because<00:01:26.280> death<00:01:27.000> is<00:01:27.180> just<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
worried about it because death is just a

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.300 
worried about it because death is just a
thing<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.780> happens<00:01:28.170> maybe<00:01:28.770> it's<00:01:28.920> cuz<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.159> read

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
thing that happens maybe it's cuz I read

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
thing that happens maybe it's cuz I read
Vonnegut<00:01:29.790> that's<00:01:30.119> probably<00:01:30.479> why<00:01:30.689> but<00:01:31.409> anyways

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
Vonnegut that's probably why but anyways

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.620 
Vonnegut that's probably why but anyways
okay<00:01:31.920> so<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.130> was<00:01:32.250> thinking<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:33.090> death<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
okay so I was thinking about death and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.990 
okay so I was thinking about death and
the<00:01:33.689> last<00:01:33.930> thing<00:01:34.079> about<00:01:34.110> life<00:01:34.740> and<00:01:35.100> life<00:01:35.460> picks

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
the last thing about life and life picks

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.749 
the last thing about life and life picks
you<00:01:36.210> off<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:37.290> life<00:01:37.500> kills<00:01:37.860> you<00:01:38.100> isn't<00:01:38.700> that

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
you off like life kills you isn't that

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:39.980 
you off like life kills you isn't that
like<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:39.000> weird<00:01:39.180> thought<00:01:39.390> like<00:01:39.570> I'm<00:01:39.720> sure

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
everybody else is thought that at some

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.399 
everybody else is thought that at some
point<00:01:41.490> but<00:01:41.909> like<00:01:42.030> just<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:42.960> how<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.049> or<00:01:43.320> is

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
