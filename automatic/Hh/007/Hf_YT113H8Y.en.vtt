00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:23.850
 Hi seekers! 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.950
 Another superhero film and another portion of Easter eggs, 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:27.950
 connected with different things. 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.380
 Mostly with Marvel, but with some others. 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.619
 We still get to them. 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.160
 Do not forget that the video will be spoilers for this 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.140
 film, other MCU films, and possibly future projects 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.140
 the company. 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 Surely I showed in this video is not all, by 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.300
 don't forget to write cool ones that you noticed 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.300
 things in the comments. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.410
 From the very beginning we get nods to the Chitauri attack 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.170
 from the previous movie The Avengers. 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.300
 When the Avengers get into the castle, making their way through 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.510
 Baron's forces, dressed in the way of the Chitauri armor, assembled 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.260
 after the Battle of New York, Tony Stark finds a secret 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.989
 a room in which there are many interesting artifacts. 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.100
 The most noticeable, of course, is Loki's scepter. 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.530
 But there is also the corpse of Leviathan from the first film, 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.140
 only greatly reduced in size. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.830
 And other technologies Chitauri, which used 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:10.820
 A stalker to increase HYDRA forces. 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.149
 By the way, about the Battle of New York. 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:14.750
 Events at the end of the Avengers still play great 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.610
 role in the formation of the MCU, not just in Hellish Kitchen 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.610
 Daredevil. 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.500
 When the Avengers return to the new Stark tower - the Tower 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.210
 Avengers - there will be a soaring frame that shows 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.100
 memorial to those who fell in the battle, including firefighters, 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.690
 who fought to save the city. 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.770
 There are so many things Marvel could do 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.750
 learns from the “Man of Steel”. 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.880
 They showed the human cost of superhero battles. 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.610
 There are some changes in the costumes, which send 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 to comics. 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.860
 Captain America's new magnetic clamp for return 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.810
 his shield was visible in the early days of the Avengers comic. 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.409
 In one of the scenes, the other personality of Astron is also mentioned. 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.409
 - Crimson Kaul. 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.060
 When he makes an upgrade and goes to Sokovia, 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.910
 that would enlist the support of the twins, at first he 

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.840
 visible to them in a red cloak. 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.660
 Explicitly referring to his first appearance in comics, in 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.870
 which he was under the pseudo-Crimson Kaul. 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.550
 In the competition “who raises the hammer of Thor” Steve Rogers 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:07.770
 quite a bit shifts the hammer hinting that 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.280
 he is really worthy of a hammer and uses it 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280
 in the comic. 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.780
 And the Black Widow refuses to participate at all. 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
 But here it is not so simple. 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:17.959
 In the “What if ...” arch, it is also considered worthy 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.930
 and becomes the goddess of thunder. 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.700
 Wall Lee has his next classic appearance, 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.099
 which also became his favorite. 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:26.600
 At the party of the Avengers about the victory over the base 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.890
 HYDRA in Sokoviya. 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.390
 Heroes invited their friends and colleagues there, including 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.620
 and war veterans who, as I understand, contemporaries 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:34.620
 Captain 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.450
 Among them will be Sten, who takes 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:39.350
 Thor's challenge is that his thousand-year-old whiskey “is not 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:40.440
 for mortals. " 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.170
 It all ends not very well. 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.340
 The chief Marovelovtsa will be led away from the party to his screams. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.940
 Towards the end Hawkeye calls his son Nathaniel 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.160
 Pietro Batn in honor of the Black Widow and Mercury. 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:53.000
 Noticeably the Red Room in which there was 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.230
 Black Widow. 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:55.890
 If you want to know about it a little more advise 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.440
 look at the series “Agent Carter”. 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.590
 On the Hulk battle scene, when he is thrown into a truck, 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.210
 Crow Food Food Service can be seen on it, possibly a hint 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.110
 to Doctor Crawford, a guy with similar powers 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:07.110
 Hulk 

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:09.380
 And Hulkbaster armor is called Veronica. 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.850
 This is a joke to the account of the comic “Archie” in which one 

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.250
 of the girls name is Veronica, and the other is Batty. 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.660
 Batty's name is Bruce's ex-girlfriend who disappeared 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:19.470
 half a dozen movies ago and we haven't seen her 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:20.470
 since. 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.150
 New program of artificial intelligence Tony Stark 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:23.510
 called "Friday." 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.900
 Once in a comic, he created it as a personal assistant, 

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.550
 calling her after the movie “His Girlfriend is Friday”. 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.420
 Also noticeable is a piece of the “Jokasta” program, which 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.730
 again from the comics in which Ultron creates 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.310
 her for myself as a bride based on the mind of Janet 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.550
 Van Dyne, wife of Ant-Men, also known as Wasp. 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.410
 But she hated him there because, you know, 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:44.410
 he's a complete moron. 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.720
 There are references to the real world and real people. 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.240
 When Iron Man sends his Iron Legion, he 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.450
 stumbles upon protest. 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.960
 Against the background of it there are drawings of Iron Man drawn 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.410
 artist Benxie. 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.120
 The fact is that on the same weekend, which fell 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.770
 the premiere of “The Avengers”, as well as in cinemas showed 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.940
 and the premiere of the Benxi Documentary. 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.430
 Surely this is somehow connected and directed by “The Age of Ultron” 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.220
 I wanted to pay tribute to the famous street artist. 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.590
 Here is another unexpected reference. 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.170
 Continuing from the first trailer, the film returns a reference. 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.340
 to Pinocchio, including moments where Altron constantly speaks 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.630
 lines from the Pinocchio song “I've Got No Strings” when he 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.630
 trying to kill his personal jepetto 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.490
 Composer Brian Tyler also admitted that the soundtrack 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:28.500
 pays tribute to the works of John Williams of “In Search 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.880
 of the lost ark ”,“ Star Wars: New 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880
 Hope ”and“ Superman ”. 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.990
 Many moments are sent to future films. 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.539
 We are getting closer to the “Civil War” through interaction 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:38.539
 characters. 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:41.520
 As Captain America almost threatens Iron Man, 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.190
 that he still has not seen his dark side. 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.240
 Their fight and death of Steve Rogers in a sleep scene possible 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:50.110
 a hint of his potential death, like the death of a story 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.930
 Captain America, immediately after the “Civil War”. 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:55.270
 There was also a person who might become 

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.780
 the enemy of the Black Panther is Yulisis Cove. 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.320
 His loss of hand is certainly preparation for installation. 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:01.490
 his cool guns. 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.440
 In general, Kevin Foggy, the head of Marvel, noticed that the loss 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.330
 hands in every Marvel second phase movie is a reference 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.220
 on “The Empire Strikes Back”. 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.550
 And quickly - Tony Stark cuts off Killian's hand 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.320
 in “Iron Man 3”, Loki presents how he chops off 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.720
 Torah’s hand in “The Kingdom of Darkness”, by Bucky of the “First Avenger” 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:21.740
 No hands, and in Guardians of the Galaxy Gamora chops off both hands 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.740
 Gruta. 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.370
 At the end of the film, when Ultron is defeated, and the original 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.151
 crew scattered around the world (and Asgard), Captain 

00:05:28.151 --> 00:05:30.750
 returns to the Avengers base to collect 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.440
 together with the Black Widow Avengers Academy. 

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:36.720
 It is later shown that the couple gathered a new team of Avengers, 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.800
 including the Falcon, the Scarlet Witch and the Warmaster 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.270
 replace retired members. 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.370
 There is even a direct nod to the comics when Captain 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.180
 introduced the new team in the 1960s. 

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.940
 And finally, the scene in the midst of shooting. 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:51.320
 In her Thanos raises the Glove of Infinity, in which 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:54.030
 there is not one stone, four of which we see in the film. 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.000
 And all of which we will see in all future films. 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
 “Wars of Infinity”. 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.419
 But this glove is not the same that we saw as 

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:01.500
 Easter eggs in Torah. 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.150
 In that movie she was on the right hand, and in this 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.150
 she is on the left. 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:06.810
 So it turns out, there are two of them? 

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:09.990
 Or the one in the Torah is meant for something else? 

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:17.770
 Maybe to challenge the enemies in a duel? 

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.830
 Who knows.
