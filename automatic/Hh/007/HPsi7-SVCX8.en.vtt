00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
what the flesh you'll see it did you

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.069 
what the flesh you'll see it did you
guys<00:00:52.500> hear<00:00:52.739> that<00:00:52.800> right<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.510> me<00:00:54.510> people

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
guys hear that right there me people

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.840 
guys hear that right there me people
think<00:00:55.170> it's<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.469> zombie<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.129> then<00:00:56.309> pretty<00:00:56.670> sure

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
think it's a zombie but then pretty sure

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.400 
think it's a zombie but then pretty sure
there's<00:00:57.030> not<00:00:57.180> a<00:00:57.210> zombie<00:00:57.449> and<00:00:59.930> so<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.289> just

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
there's not a zombie and so this is just

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.650 
there's not a zombie and so this is just
another<00:01:01.710> theory<00:01:02.129> i'm<00:01:02.340> pretty<00:01:02.670> sure<00:01:02.940> samuel

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
another theory i'm pretty sure samuel

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.939 
another theory i'm pretty sure samuel
becoming<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.110> zombie<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.530> everyone's
