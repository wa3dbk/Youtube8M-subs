00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.370
 I stop by for this short video 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.690
 show you a color here away from the country 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.940
 if I have a nice even 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.789
 gradient as a caller run 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.680
 I want to work on my cake now 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.330
 with a blue and a white one found 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.160
 I can definitely recommend you 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.859
 if you want to use this method 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.570
 that you best only from one 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.279
 bright to a dark color works 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.870
 or the other way around, but not that you too 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.760
 example two complementary colors like 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.020
 red or green for example, that takes 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.010
 In the end, it would be really terrible 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.500
 I would like you to look at each one 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 do not recommend this case 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.260
 ok I work here now with each 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.820
 250 grams 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.170
 that's enough for me in any case 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.879
 to demonstrate to you as the whole 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 works if you but a right 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.510
 I would definitely have pie 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.000
 Recommend slightly larger amounts of land 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.960
 to use for it 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.520
 okay i have mine from country now 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.469
 each time pretty smooth 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.510
 kneaded so that is beautifully elastic 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:03.149
 and now I take the white one 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.619
 bandaged and roll in a strand and 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.330
 one side had the one end of the 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.150
 strand I wanted very, very thin 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.220
 So yes I know that in any case 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.659
 to run in and do the same thing 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.600
 I now with my second color 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.390
 with the blue of land that is 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.040
 just once relatively evenly too 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.840
 a long roll out the strand 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.340
 if that's not too uniform it is 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.100
 that is not so dramatic then 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.479
 you do not have to worry 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.490
 the whole thing looks like this with me now 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.920
 all I do now is one thing 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.600
 end is a thin end of the financial with 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.460
 one with the other color with the 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.020
 to connect thick internet like that 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.420
 can see there now and now I should 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.970
 that once briefly to one to a whole 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.780
 complete long rods together 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.130
 and then it almost has 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.409
 managed I take now quite a 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.479
 normal knife and cuts me 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.799
 even pieces down here I know 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.439
 not like many have lifted but that 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.579
 it ultimately does not matter 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.840
 now you have in any case if you 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.219
 you care about the pieces cuts 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.200
 that here is a nice even 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.930
 Gradient because we are on the one 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.790
 side of the fund in the thick dark 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.049
 had color and the other side was yes 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.090
 in the light color 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.470
 I hope you understand me but you 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.320
 in any case look like the whole 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.130
 that works super easy 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:16.890
 that means the next step is 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.570
 just everything smooth together 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.830
 knead with each other and in the beginning 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:21.450
 It usually looks like that 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.460
 color stays the same all the time and 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.690
 if you put two colors next to each other 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.910
 then it looks the same when the 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.500
 color is the same if you but 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.880
 look at the end then you see 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.180
 every case then the beautiful color gradient 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.130
 and was different I have mine 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.690
 fondant my very long strand now 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.220
 cut into relatively small pieces 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.390
 but you could also do that in bigger ones 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.370
 pieces cut for example this 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.900
 very long had not straight 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.370
 if you are the only four, for example 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.230
 I still have some cuts 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.270
 nice gradient I hope you understand 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:49.590
 what I mean but you have to get up 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:51.330
 do not limit each case to this 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:54.690
 size in pieces that I now there 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:56.040
 okay you cut it on everyone 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.170
 but it ensures that you have one 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.760
 pretty same with 7 0 run off because you 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.410
 just at the beginning of this method with the 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.100
 made two colors into each other 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.120
 Of course, that's super enjoyable 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:07.920
 I have my country now again 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.470
 for ten 15 minutes just like that 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.820
 leave because I kneaded that long 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.350
 with my warm hands that 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.090
 has become relatively soft that is 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.710
 if you have the problem also if yours 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.000
 of the extreme sticking would be then 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:19.200
 I times are still a few minutes 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.850
 let me do that a bit 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.800
 can reassure , so to speak, and then 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.420
 I can keep working and then 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.180
 to make different patterns with it 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.750
 or just what your heart desires 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.040
 every case 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.300
 that's just not just that now 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.130
 method and want to show how beautiful 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.900
 get even color gradient without 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.520
 that each piece is a cent extra 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.460
 Colorize is because you have two 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.720
 large pieces that have been colored 

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.380
 then they knead you together and then 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:45.360
 have the nice even color gradient 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.860
 okay that was it then as far as me 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.240
 Hope you liked the short video 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.640
 but maybe helpful because of me 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.730
 This is an old video of me quite often 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:55.110
 to ask questions I have ok if something else 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.940
 I want to see something else in front of me 

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.500
 best on the right or left video 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.660
 who has questions he writes me the am 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.640
 best and take the comments and 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.080
 then I wish you even beautiful 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.400
 Easter days and see you in the next 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.400
 video is good
