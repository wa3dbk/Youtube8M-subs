00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
is any menu so let's generate this for a

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.260 
is any menu so let's generate this for a
second<00:01:55.840> there<00:01:56.049> we<00:01:56.110> go<00:01:56.290> ah<00:01:56.470> nice<00:01:57.190> snow<00:01:58.090> biome

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270

00:02:26.339 --> 00:02:26.349 
can just get this egg right click and as

00:02:26.349 --> 00:02:28.530 
can just get this egg right click and as
you<00:02:26.440> can<00:02:26.560> see<00:02:26.590> you<00:02:26.950> can<00:02:27.250> spawn<00:02:27.670> mobs<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.360> this

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
apart from a few I guess but magma cubes

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.860 
apart from a few I guess but magma cubes
blazes<00:02:36.579> and<00:02:36.760> such<00:02:37.200> they're<00:02:38.200> all<00:02:39.870> being

blazes and such they're all being
spammed<00:02:41.260> with<00:02:41.440> this<00:02:41.829> so<00:02:42.340> that<00:02:42.879> is<00:02:43.060> pretty

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:20.109 
is pretty funny and another thing that I

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.309 
is pretty funny and another thing that I
do<00:03:20.169> actually<00:03:20.980> really<00:03:21.760> like<00:03:21.970> is<00:03:22.180> that<00:03:22.810> they<00:03:23.109> now

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:23.319

do<00:03:27.250> that<00:03:27.519> and<00:03:27.760> that<00:03:28.269> was<00:03:28.450> very<00:03:28.510> very<00:03:29.049> annoying

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
do that and that was very very annoying

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.640 
do that and that was very very annoying
because<00:03:30.940> I'm<00:03:31.450> one<00:03:31.720> should<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:31.959> had<00:03:32.079> shared<00:03:32.379> all

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
because I'm one should I had shared all

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.099 
because I'm one should I had shared all
the<00:03:32.829> sheep's<00:03:33.340> in<00:03:33.519> your<00:03:33.669> world<00:03:33.879> and<00:03:34.180> there<00:03:34.989> was

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
the sheep's in your world and there was

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:38.190 
the sheep's in your world and there was
no<00:03:35.349> where<00:03:35.560> to<00:03:35.739> get<00:03:36.069> any<00:03:36.280> more<00:03:36.489> rule<00:03:36.780> or<00:03:37.780> you<00:03:38.049> had

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
no where to get any more rule or you had

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.920 
no where to get any more rule or you had
to<00:03:38.349> wander<00:03:38.620> off<00:03:38.889> like<00:03:38.919> a<00:03:39.160> very<00:03:39.579> large<00:03:41.819> distance

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:42.930 
to wander off like a very large distance

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:47.039 
to wander off like a very large distance
so<00:03:43.930> and<00:03:44.549> well<00:03:45.549> basically<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:46.299> is<00:03:46.359> it<00:03:46.720> for

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
so and well basically this is it for

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.379 
so and well basically this is it for
this<00:03:47.169> update<00:03:47.410> it's<00:03:47.799> as<00:03:47.980> I<00:03:48.250> said<00:03:48.400> snapshot<00:03:49.209> it

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:49.389

00:03:51.539 --> 00:03:51.549 
isn't really pre-release but it's a bit

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:54.960 
isn't really pre-release but it's a bit
smaller<00:03:51.879> but<00:03:52.180> there<00:03:53.169> were<00:03:53.260> a<00:03:53.290> few<00:03:53.470> bug<00:03:54.400> fixes

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
smaller but there were a few bug fixes

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:00.050 
smaller but there were a few bug fixes

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
that but that is basically it and that's

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.430 
that but that is basically it and that's
kind<00:04:09.489> of<00:04:09.579> weird<00:04:09.790> actually<00:04:10.060> snow<00:04:10.870> next<00:04:11.199> to<00:04:11.410> a
