the equation is well worth it and it'll

for a fire one strike from a Ferro rod
as<00:00:56.280> an<00:00:56.430> example<00:00:56.840> so<00:00:57.840> I<00:00:57.899> could<00:00:58.050> do<00:00:58.109> a<00:00:58.140> lot<00:00:58.289> of

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
as an example so I could do a lot of

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
as an example so I could do a lot of
things<00:00:58.620> here<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.789> tinder<00:01:00.180> bundle<00:01:00.329> I

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
things here with this tinder bundle I

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.389 
things here with this tinder bundle I
could<00:01:00.870> drop<00:01:01.020> a<00:01:01.079> coal<00:01:01.350> in<00:01:01.530> it<00:01:01.649> from<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:02.039> friction

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
could drop a coal in it from a friction

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.770 
could drop a coal in it from a friction
fire<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.739> more<00:01:04.739> than<00:01:04.890> likely<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.400> my

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
fire I could more than likely if my

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.140 
fire I could more than likely if my
ferrocene<00:01:06.780> rod<00:01:07.049> was<00:01:07.770> good<00:01:08.430> enough<00:01:08.640> and<00:01:09.000> I<00:01:09.119> got

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
ferrocene rod was good enough and I got

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.700 
ferrocene rod was good enough and I got
the<00:01:09.420> hot<00:01:09.570> enough<00:01:09.750> spark<00:01:10.080> I<00:01:10.200> could<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.530> light

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
the hot enough spark I could just light

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.940 
the hot enough spark I could just light
it<00:01:10.740> with<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:12.030> could<00:01:12.600> shave<00:01:12.950> magnesium

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
it with that I could shave magnesium

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.160 
it with that I could shave magnesium
shavings<00:01:13.979> into<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.820> then<00:01:15.119> light<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.689> I<00:01:15.840> could

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
shavings into it then light it I could

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.499 
shavings into it then light it I could
use<00:01:16.799> char<00:01:17.130> cloth<00:01:17.280> and<00:01:17.670> drop<00:01:17.850> char<00:01:18.119> cloth<00:01:18.240> in

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
use char cloth and drop char cloth in

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.660 
use char cloth and drop char cloth in
here<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:19.229> I<00:01:19.259> could<00:01:19.500> use<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.650> magnifying<00:01:20.189> lens<00:01:20.310> is

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
here or I could use a magnifying lens is

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.039 
here or I could use a magnifying lens is
another<00:01:20.939> example<00:01:21.119> I'm<00:01:21.450> going<00:01:21.600> to<00:01:21.659> try<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:21.960> do

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
another example I'm going to try and do

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.410 
another example I'm going to try and do
that<00:01:22.200> right<00:01:22.380> now<00:01:22.619> with<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.860> Fresnel<00:01:23.310> lens<00:01:23.580> and

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
that right now with a Fresnel lens and

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.300 
that right now with a Fresnel lens and
this<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.259> pretty<00:01:25.500> weak<00:01:25.770> Fresnel

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
this is actually a pretty weak Fresnel

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.190 
this is actually a pretty weak Fresnel
lens<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.090> magnification<00:01:28.020> is<00:01:28.140> only

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
lens in that it's magnification is only

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.249 
lens in that it's magnification is only
two<00:01:28.470> times<00:01:28.710> you<00:01:28.890> can<00:01:29.070> find<00:01:29.369> them<00:01:29.520> with<00:01:29.549> higher

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
two times you can find them with higher

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:31.999 
two times you can find them with higher
magnification<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.530> when<00:01:31.740> you're<00:01:31.860> dealing

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
magnification and when you're dealing

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.100 
magnification and when you're dealing
with<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.340> lower<00:01:32.579> magnification<00:01:33.299> piece<00:01:33.960> of

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
with a lower magnification piece of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.200 
with a lower magnification piece of
equipment<00:01:34.619> such<00:01:34.799> as<00:01:34.829> this<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.400> think<00:01:35.939> it's

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
equipment such as this I think it's

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
equipment such as this I think it's
critical<00:01:36.630> to<00:01:36.810> get<00:01:36.930> everything<00:01:37.200> lined<00:01:37.500> up<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.009> I

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
critical to get everything lined up so I

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.170 
critical to get everything lined up so I
could<00:01:38.700> point<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:40.049> sunlight<00:01:40.640> from<00:01:41.640> an<00:01:41.820> angle

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
could point the sunlight from an angle

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.999 
could point the sunlight from an angle
into<00:01:42.360> my<00:01:42.570> tinder<00:01:42.810> bundle<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.530> I'll<00:01:43.619> get<00:01:43.799> more

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
into my tinder bundle that I'll get more

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.990 
into my tinder bundle that I'll get more
intensity<00:01:44.670> if<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.560> line<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.590> my<00:01:46.890> Fresnel<00:01:47.670> lens

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
intensity if I line up my Fresnel lens

intensity if I line up my Fresnel lens
with<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.750> Sun<00:01:48.960> so<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.290> sun's<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:49.770> much

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
with the Sun so the sun's pretty much

with the Sun so the sun's pretty much
behind<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:51.030> camera<00:01:51.450> and<00:01:51.600> I'm<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.680> going<00:01:52.829> to

try and get all this in line and this

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.039 
try and get all this in line and this
isn't<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.470> to<00:01:55.560> burst<00:01:55.829> into<00:01:56.189> flame<00:01:56.990> but<00:01:57.990> it

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
isn't going to burst into flame but it

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.649 
isn't going to burst into flame but it
will<00:01:58.770> generate<00:01:59.520> a<00:02:00.290> ember<00:02:01.290> in<00:02:01.469> the<00:02:01.530> tinder<00:02:02.659> that

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
will generate a ember in the tinder that

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.290 
will generate a ember in the tinder that
I<00:02:04.020> will<00:02:04.770> hopefully<00:02:05.270> blow<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.450> flame

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:08.300 
I will hopefully blow to flame

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.380 
I will hopefully blow to flame
I<00:02:08.420> hope<00:02:09.050> this<00:02:09.260> in<00:02:09.470> the<00:02:09.560> camera<00:02:10.270> because<00:02:11.270> I

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
I hope this in the camera because I

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:31.800 
I hope this in the camera because I
can't<00:02:11.690> see

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.130 

that<00:02:32.440> easy

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
that easy

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:46.690 
that easy
if<00:02:34.620> you<00:02:34.770> do<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.010> right<00:02:35.330> sit<00:02:36.330> right<00:02:36.510> down

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:57.199 

and<00:02:47.180> just<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.690> time<00:02:47.870> the<00:02:48.440> Sun<00:02:48.800> disappeared

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.550 

so<00:02:57.780> good<00:02:58.019> tender<00:02:58.319> bundle<00:02:58.739> worth<00:02:59.250> the<00:02:59.280> effort

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
so good tender bundle worth the effort

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.399 
so good tender bundle worth the effort
two-thirds<00:03:01.560> of<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.829> equation<00:03:03.200> hope<00:03:04.200> that

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
two-thirds of the equation hope that

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.799 
two-thirds of the equation hope that
helps<00:03:04.650> you<00:03:04.709> out
