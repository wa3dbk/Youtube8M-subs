00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:25.719 
out well at least I thought he would and
he<00:01:24.319> did<00:01:24.679> so<00:01:24.890> i<00:01:24.920> go<00:01:25.069> for<00:01:25.160> the<00:01:25.250> hard<00:01:25.429> world<00:01:25.580> her

he did so i go for the hard world her

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:28.240 
he did so i go for the hard world her
here<00:01:25.970> which<00:01:26.840> basically<00:01:27.709> i<00:01:27.830> was<00:01:27.979> hoping<00:01:28.160> for

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
here which basically i was hoping for

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.249 
here which basically i was hoping for
the<00:01:28.399> flinch<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:29.060> you<00:01:29.390> know<00:01:29.509> it's<00:01:29.750> a<00:01:30.140> good

00:01:30.249 --> 00:01:30.259 
the flinch it's you know it's a good

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:32.770 
the flinch it's you know it's a good
it's<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.619> great<00:01:31.069> great<00:01:31.819> move<00:01:32.030> for<00:01:32.330> for

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
it's a great great move for for

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.050 
it's a great great move for for
flinching<00:01:33.050> um<00:01:33.500> I<00:01:33.740> think<00:01:34.130> the<00:01:34.550> flinch<00:01:34.789> rate<00:01:34.940> is

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
flinching um I think the flinch rate is

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.460 
flinching um I think the flinch rate is
only<00:01:35.179> like<00:01:35.390> ten<00:01:35.569> percent<00:01:35.899> but<00:01:36.080> it<00:01:36.170> seems<00:01:36.349> to

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
only like ten percent but it seems to

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.109 
only like ten percent but it seems to
always<00:01:36.560> do<00:01:36.800> it<00:01:36.950> for<00:01:37.099> me<00:01:37.220> and<00:01:37.429> what<00:01:37.789> this<00:01:37.940> one

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
always do it for me and what this one

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:39.370 
always do it for me and what this one
time<00:01:38.300> it<00:01:38.569> decided<00:01:38.929> it<00:01:39.020> was<00:01:39.110> going<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.289> be<00:01:39.349> a

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
metric ton of cop um because I could

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.300 
metric ton of cop um because I could
have<00:02:09.289> really<00:02:09.470> used<00:02:09.500> that<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:09.950> today's<00:02:10.130> it<00:02:10.220> goes

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.830 
for the gyroball in there I lose about a
third<00:02:12.110> HP<00:02:12.709> and<00:02:12.980> I<00:02:13.819> finally<00:02:14.420> get<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.630> sleep

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
third HP and I finally get the sleep

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.930 
third HP and I finally get the sleep
powder<00:02:15.020> off<00:02:15.290> hahahaha<00:02:16.040> get<00:02:16.430> off<00:02:16.550> we're<00:02:16.849> going

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
powder off hahahaha get off we're going

powder off hahahaha get off we're going
to<00:02:17.030> go<00:02:17.150> on<00:02:17.270> with<00:02:17.450> that<00:02:17.569> uh<00:02:17.630> get<00:02:18.620> off<00:02:18.709> again<00:02:18.980> I

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
to go on with that uh get off again I

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.490 
to go on with that uh get off again I
always<00:02:19.310> say<00:02:19.520> that<00:02:19.760> it's<00:02:20.000> like<00:02:20.209> I<00:02:20.480> I'd<00:02:21.230> never

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
always say that it's like I I'd never

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:23.050 
always say that it's like I I'd never
say<00:02:21.709> it<00:02:21.739> hits<00:02:22.040> it's<00:02:22.280> always<00:02:22.520> for<00:02:22.670> some<00:02:22.790> reason

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
say it hits it's always for some reason

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:24.400 
say it hits it's always for some reason
it's<00:02:23.180> get<00:02:23.360> off<00:02:23.480> but<00:02:23.840> there's<00:02:24.020> not<00:02:24.110> much<00:02:24.260> I<00:02:24.349> can

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
it's get off but there's not much I can

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:25.630 
it's get off but there's not much I can
do<00:02:24.530> about<00:02:24.560> that<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:24.860> guess<00:02:25.069> it's<00:02:25.310> just<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.520> way

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
do about that I guess it's just the way

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.220 
do about that I guess it's just the way
I<00:02:25.670> talk<00:02:25.910> so<00:02:26.150> I<00:02:26.180> decided<00:02:26.569> to<00:02:26.629> see<00:02:26.780> them<00:02:26.930> up<00:02:27.019> here

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
I talk so I decided to see them up here

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.970 
I talk so I decided to see them up here
predicting<00:02:27.739> the<00:02:27.829> switch<00:02:28.390> and<00:02:29.390> I<00:02:30.170> end<00:02:30.890> up

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
predicting the switch and I end up

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.050 
predicting the switch and I end up
seeding<00:02:31.400> his

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
seeding his

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.690 
seeding his
uh<00:02:32.290> hisses<00:02:33.290> or<00:02:33.500> so<00:02:33.950> he<00:02:34.069> goes<00:02:34.190> for<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.430> u-turn

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
uh hisses or so he goes for the u-turn

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.790 
uh hisses or so he goes for the u-turn
here<00:02:34.970> I<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.720> basically<00:02:35.989> stated<00:02:36.440> thinking<00:02:36.739> I

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:36.800 
here I just basically stated thinking I

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.120 
here I just basically stated thinking I
could<00:02:36.860> live<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.550> I<00:02:37.730> do<00:02:37.790> with<00:02:38.209> the<00:02:38.390> 109<00:02:39.130> HP

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
could live it and I do with the 109 HP

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.880 
could live it and I do with the 109 HP
and<00:02:40.489> in<00:02:40.910> before<00:02:41.390> specs<00:02:41.750> comes<00:02:42.050> in<00:02:42.230> so<00:02:42.650> I'm

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
and in before specs comes in so I'm

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.650 
and in before specs comes in so I'm
guessing<00:02:43.099> this<00:02:43.459> thing<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.760> fucking<00:02:43.910> specs<00:02:44.390> I

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
guessing this thing is fucking specs I

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.150 
guessing this thing is fucking specs I
don't<00:02:44.870> know<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.170> name<00:02:45.319> kind<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.739> tells<00:02:45.980> me

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
don't know the name kind of tells me

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.850 
don't know the name kind of tells me
that<00:02:46.360> but<00:02:47.360> I<00:02:47.420> do<00:02:47.540> as<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.780> go<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.200> just<00:02:48.410> go<00:02:48.530> right<00:02:48.709> in

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
that but I do as I go I just go right in

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.140 
that but I do as I go I just go right in
with<00:02:48.950> the<00:02:48.980> energy<00:02:49.160> ball<00:02:49.489> because<00:02:49.790> it's<00:02:49.940> tab

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
with the energy ball because it's tab

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.370 
with the energy ball because it's tab
and<00:02:50.390> I<00:02:50.450> really<00:02:50.780> don't<00:02:50.959> see<00:02:51.050> the<00:02:51.080> point<00:02:51.200> in

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
and I really don't see the point in

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.890 
and I really don't see the point in
switching<00:02:51.709> out<00:02:51.800> at<00:02:51.950> this<00:02:52.040> point<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.400> time<00:02:52.900> so

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
switching out at this point in time so

switching out at this point in time so
anyway<00:02:54.200> he<00:02:54.410> goes<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.709> the<00:02:54.769> hidden<00:02:54.890> power<00:02:55.160> here

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
anyway he goes for the hidden power here

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.330 
anyway he goes for the hidden power here
well<00:02:56.480> excuse<00:02:57.019> me<00:02:57.050> wow<00:02:57.530> I<00:02:57.560> didn't<00:02:57.980> realize<00:02:58.040> I
