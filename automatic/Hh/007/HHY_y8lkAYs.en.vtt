00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.090
 hi friends today in crazy crafts 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:18.220
 let's learn how to decorate a tree 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:22.020
 Christmas with good ribbon to start 

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:22.020
 what we are going to need is 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.210
 a ribbon and good let me tell you that 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:31.869
 the first is the Christmas tree measures 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:34.629
 approximately three and a half meters and 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.180
 I have here a ribbon and I set this ribbon 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.340
 over five meters and a half the 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:41.350
 important of this bar is that 

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:44.440
 You need me to have some wire in 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.810
 the edges because as you can 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.880
 watch 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.040
 the way he folded it that way he stays 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.930
 then it is very important and it is a 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.210
 very fun way to decorate your 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.730
 little tree in the past year I did this and 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.850
 I had several friends who asked me to 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:03.420
 will show how to do it and good to the 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.820
 another thing that we are going to need is a 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.640
 couple of leagues and I do not know if you can see them 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.010
 here are these are small leagues and I 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.560
 included green so they do not show 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.780
 in the little tree but in Chinese it does not matter 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.450
 well of any type of leagues that 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.660
 have anything at hand 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.720
 can help hold the ribbon of the 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:29.430
 top of the tree 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.650
 we are going to need four rolls 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.190
 this ribbon can be found in 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 any bone shop or in this I bought it 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.630
 in ioannes and well let's start the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.900
 first step 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.120
 is to put the lights on the tree I know that 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.820
 some trees now come with the 

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:50.520
 Integrated lights then do not have 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.920
 what to worry about that but yes but if 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.290
 Your tree requires lights then 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.610
 As a first step put the lights now 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:01.190
 let's start by placing 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.130
 the ribbon the top part where 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.450
 you can put your star or your angel and 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.569
 let's put the league 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.830
 to hold it and not to not fall 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:16.820
 the ribbon since you are fastened 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:21.210
 this way we're going to start putting 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:24.350
 the bar in the middle of the water that 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:27.470
 we want to do is to adore him 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:31.130
 attracts the ribbon so that it does not come and 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:33.340
 we will work down now 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.020
 make sure not to pull it so it does not 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.190
 the bar comes to us and that's why 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.080
 that it is important that 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:43.400
 buy 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.400
 of this type of piston 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.840
 so that it stays like this 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.440
 they are working with your little tree towards 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.600
 down 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.520
 if they want to make a straight line they can 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.350
 do it if they want to do it a little 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:01.350
 deviated deviated too 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.760
 and in any case it looks very 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.760
 pretty the truth 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:14.630
 you can also use your imagination and 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:18.850
 use the ribbon of different colors 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.850
 I tried to find something Christmas 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:25.550
 as you can see do not take any time 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.910
 and it looks nice now I'm going to do what 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:32.330
 same with these the other parts of the 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.040
 tree and here I have my other roll after 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.040
 to teach a shot of how it looks 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.040
 good friends, I already put the waits to you 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:44.010
 ring 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.859
 can see the different slats I 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.989
 I put pictures has can put more and 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:52.730
 I promise you it looks much better in 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.730
 I hope you liked it 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.140
 and here that a shot already with the lights 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.470
 turned on so they see that you see a lot 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:06.470
 best 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:32.290
 friends before saying goodbye anything 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.030
 more I wanted to share this idea with you 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:35.500
 I came up with some spheres that 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.140
 had glass that he could no longer use 

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:40.120
 because I broke the others and had 

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:43.120
 these spheres here that I already thought 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:46.600
 discard but to me it struck me that 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.849
 I could put them in this container of 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:54.289
 crystal and nothing else 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:57.169
 I used them here and it occurred to me that it is 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.439
 a very good idea as decoration is a 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:03.580
 it was a way to recycle so they do not have 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:06.479
 to get rid of their spheres 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.009
 and they already have a nice centerpiece 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:12.159
 our to her friends 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:13.960
 janet and glory of crazy man crafts 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:15.789
 They want you to have a very happy time 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:17.919
