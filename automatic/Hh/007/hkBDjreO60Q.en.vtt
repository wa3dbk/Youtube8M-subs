00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.750

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.490

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.439
 before they call me a malinchista and 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.480
 who knows that the instrument that 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.400
 mexico this tradition is not used 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.439
 of the Easter rabbit back spoken the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.420
 smell but if it is to use it in others 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.980

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.980
 know this tradition together 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.429
 As they had commented, I had the 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.359
 curious to know the meaning of 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.489
 This tradition 

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:44.589
 so I was touring the wikipedia santa 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.390
 according to the legend the rabbit bring high 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.250
 full of colorful eggs and candy to 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.039
 children's homes is mentioned by 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.489
 first time in the work of georg frank a 

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.309
 fan that even of bishops and virus job something 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.989
 so about the easter eggs of 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.969
 1682 which refers to a tradition of 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.039
 Alsace of a hare that brings eggs from 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.989
 easter in pagan origin is supposed to 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.539
 the choice of the rabbit is due to its 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.220
 known ability to procreate from 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.200
 before Christ - the rabbit was a 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.509
 symbol of fertility and immaturity 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:16.360
 gonadal associated with the Phoenician goddess 

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.380
 quite someone else was also dedicated 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.360
 the month of April 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.119
 the rabbit as a symbol of fertility 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.310
 and renewal in the German religion is 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.350
 It became a tradition within 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.509
 this tradition there was a legend 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.610
 German in which a poor woman 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:32.590
 unable to offer sweets to their children 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.170
 hidden in the garden decorated eggs 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.939
 the children seeing a rabbit believed that 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.619
 I had laid the eggs since then 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:40.569
 the children made a nest that 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.710
 He was in the garden waiting 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:44.119
 the bunny eggs 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.600
 4 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:51.140
 and have dressed 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:55.130
 I'm not a father 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.990
 wow in Christianity already within the 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.460
 5th century 678 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.290
 Germanic Christians had 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.780
 transferred that feast to the faith 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.790
 Christian assigning him the celebration of 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.320
 the resurrection of christ and they adopted the 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.729
 pagan track in the traditions 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.770
 Christians in this new framework 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.840
 they developed the legend that when 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.790
 they put Jesus in the tomb had 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.130
 inside the cave a hidden rabbit 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.380
 that very scared saw as all the people 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.360
 I went in crying and I was sad because 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:22.130
 jesus had died the rabbit stayed 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.630
 there seeing the body of Jesus when 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.520
 they put the stone that closed the 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
 entrance so he spends a lot of time watching it 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:29.810
 all day and all night when from 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.100
 suddenly he saw that Jesus got up and doubled 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.019
 the sheets with which they had 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.000
 wrapped an angel that take stone that 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:35.330
 it covered the entrance and Jesus left the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.280
 cave 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.019
 the rabbit understood that Jesus was the 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.730
 son of god and decided that he had to 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.380
 warn the world and all people 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.000
 they cried that they no longer had to 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.010
 be sad because Jesus had 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.870
 resurrected like rabbits can not 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.550
 talk occurred to him that if he had a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.739
 painted egg that they would understand the 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:53.780
 message of life and joy and so he did 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.500
 since then according to the legend the 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.360
 rabbit leaves every Sunday 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.220
 to leave colored eggs in all 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.370
 houses to remind the world that jesus 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.050
 resurrected and that you have to live happy and 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 good in particular it seems like a 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.770
 nice story so I hope that you 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.450
 like all those who celebrate this 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.920
 great tradition and those not now 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:12.870
 we celebrate it would be very funny 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.640
 try and well I already talked a lot 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.580
 let's do it 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:19.410
 you will need eggs kinder surprise 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.959
 Paint of different colors is very 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.570
 important that is not toxic brushes and 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.790
 diamond brushes and all that 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:29.220
 material that serves to decorate and for 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.170
 Of course the surprise is saying what 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.090
 go to introduce in the egg what 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:35.430
 first is to unwrap very carefully 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:38.400
 the chocolate takes care that the whole 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.440
 the wrapper will need soon 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.450
 separates very carefully the two parts 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.239
 of chocolate can help you with a 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.790
 knife then replaces the surprise 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.500
 with something that you want money jewelry 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.500
 sweet coins and so on 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.760
 reassemble the egg and proceed 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.760
 wrap it with the original wrap 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.170
 remember to maintain impeccable hygiene 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.810
 you may have some problems in 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:06.760
 this point but obviously neglects 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.409
 it will be like factory and the 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.750
 wrapper you may have left a little 

00:04:08.409 --> 00:04:12.519
 loose to solve this we take 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:15.250
 small pieces of toilet paper or 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:18.239
 napkin and using only water 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.430
 clean we proceed to stick some layers 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:23.320
 Once the eggs are covered, leave them 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.300
 dry with the fan because 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.970
 obvious reasons if you leave it to the sun 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.800
 chocolate is finally melted 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:34.050
 since they dried up it was time for 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.050
 paint them and decorate them as you like 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.150
 or something 

00:04:55.700 --> 00:05:00.050
 I hope you liked this

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.370
 use this same technique and hide 

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:06.200
 inside what you want money 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.300
