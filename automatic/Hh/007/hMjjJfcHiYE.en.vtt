00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
made a point to say that he was only the

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.070 
made a point to say that he was only the
only<00:00:39.950> black<00:00:40.510> skateboarder<00:00:41.510> on<00:00:41.630> the<00:00:41.750> entire

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.080 
only black skateboarder on the entire

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.770 
only black skateboarder on the entire
list<00:00:42.520> that<00:00:43.520> makes<00:00:43.760> a<00:00:43.910> lot<00:00:43.940> of<00:00:44.090> sense<00:00:44.210> even

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
list that makes a lot of sense even

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.299 
list that makes a lot of sense even
though<00:00:44.840> there's<00:00:45.020> a<00:00:45.110> long<00:00:45.290> list<00:00:45.530> of<00:00:45.710> them<00:00:45.920> I

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
though there's a long list of them I

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:48.190 
though there's a long list of them I
think<00:00:46.970> Steve<00:00:47.180> Wiggins<00:00:47.480> was<00:00:47.780> the<00:00:47.930> most

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
think Steve Wiggins was the most

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.229 
think Steve Wiggins was the most
influential<00:00:48.830> you<00:00:49.220> got<00:00:49.400> like<00:00:49.520> great<00:00:49.790> bargain

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:50.239 
influential you got like great bargain

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:52.150 
influential you got like great bargain
you<00:00:50.330> got<00:00:50.510> like<00:00:50.690> Bashar<00:00:51.170> mostly<00:00:51.680> a<00:00:51.710> whole<00:00:51.950> lot

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.160 
you got like Bashar mostly a whole lot

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.010 
you got like Bashar mostly a whole lot
of<00:00:52.190> black<00:00:52.489> skaters<00:00:52.970> who<00:00:53.480> never<00:00:53.660> got<00:00:53.870> that

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
of black skaters who never got that

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.350 
of black skaters who never got that
recognition<00:00:54.500> but<00:00:55.430> I<00:00:55.460> think<00:00:55.820> Steve<00:00:56.150> Wiggins

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
recognition but I think Steve Wiggins

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.720 
recognition but I think Steve Wiggins
was<00:00:56.630> so<00:00:56.780> influential<00:00:57.140> was<00:00:57.530> because<00:00:57.860> he

00:00:58.720 --> 00:00:58.730 
was so influential was because he

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.000 
was so influential was because he
dresses<00:00:59.120> like<00:00:59.150> me<00:00:59.329> but<00:00:59.720> he<00:00:59.840> dressed<00:01:00.110> like<00:01:00.200> like

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
dresses like me but he dressed like like

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.240 
dresses like me but he dressed like like
the<00:01:01.100> rapper<00:01:01.370> or<00:01:01.640> something<00:01:02.030> but<00:01:02.390> he's<00:01:02.510> a<00:01:02.540> total

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
the rapper or something but he's a total

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.650 
the rapper or something but he's a total
thoroughbred<00:01:04.250> skateboarder<00:01:04.880> but<00:01:05.300> he<00:01:05.420> has<00:01:05.540> the

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
thoroughbred skateboarder but he has the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.870 
thoroughbred skateboarder but he has the
personality<00:01:05.930> of<00:01:06.440> her<00:01:06.680> a<00:01:06.710> star<00:01:07.130> has<00:01:07.430> to<00:01:07.580> grill

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:07.880 
personality of her a star has to grill

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.420 
personality of her a star has to grill
the<00:01:08.180> swagger<00:01:08.960> and<00:01:09.170> everything<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.950> like<00:01:10.130> a<00:01:10.160> rap

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
the swagger and everything of like a rap

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.109 
the swagger and everything of like a rap
star<00:01:10.580> I<00:01:11.710> think<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.830> was<00:01:12.979> just<00:01:13.369> that<00:01:13.700> they<00:01:13.820> put

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
star I think that was just that they put

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.930 
star I think that was just that they put
him<00:01:14.600> on<00:01:14.630> there<00:01:15.020> but<00:01:15.050> i<00:01:15.350> don't<00:01:15.560> think<00:01:15.770> a

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
him on there but i don't think a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.690 
him on there but i don't think a
only<00:01:17.360> 30<00:01:17.540> on<00:01:17.810> it<00:01:18.200> cause<00:01:18.470> black<00:01:18.830> representation

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
only 30 on it cause black representation

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.490 
only 30 on it cause black representation
and<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.000> culture<00:01:20.360> of<00:01:20.390> skateboarding<00:01:20.960> and<00:01:21.350> our

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
and the culture of skateboarding and our

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.770 
and the culture of skateboarding and our
constant<00:01:21.890> users<00:01:22.130> to<00:01:22.280> it<00:01:22.430> it<00:01:23.330> goes<00:01:23.509> back

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
constant users to it it goes back

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.639 
constant users to it it goes back
further<00:01:23.990> than<00:01:24.170> Stevie<00:01:24.680> but<00:01:25.450> hey<00:01:26.470> Stevie<00:01:27.470> was

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
weird when you first start skating

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:37.179 
weird when you first start skating
