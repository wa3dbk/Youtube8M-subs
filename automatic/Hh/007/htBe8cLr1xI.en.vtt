00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.320
 First child in mechanical saline problem 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:13.650
 Mix 10% saline with 4% saline 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.199
 How many grams each you want to make 4280 grams of 8% saline 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.579
 Should I mix 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:23.579
 about it 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 Let's revise and organize the seat of the parliament 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.349
 4% of 400 million yen 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:33.740
 I do not know whether or not the 3 Corborn 

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:34.860
 to this 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.350
 Mix ie10% saline solution 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.449
 I don't know how many grams this is 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.000
 I want to make an 8% saline solution 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.450
 I want to make 4 280 grams of 8% saline solution 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.070
 about it 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.070
 It would have been nice to have several grams of each 

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.830
 That's all I know from the problem 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:03.500
 What did you do next 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.890
 Yes please put x 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.100
 Should I mix each 班 gram 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.820
 In the same way as xgrid can't do each of them 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.050
 It becomes 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.080
 So please put either x 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.409
 Japanese music group of 4% English salt water 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.470
 It was made 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.470
 Then 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.570
 What about the 10% saline solution? 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.070
 This x g 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.590
 People mixed with 10% saline 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.390
 The whole is 4280 grams 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.920
 So 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.890
 10% saline drops 480-apex 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.440
 I hope you do the same 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.500
 here 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.500
 4% saline solution 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:01.670
 To be an X brand bowwa 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.870
 This salt water mixed with 10 salt water and the whole is 4280 grams 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.189
 Because it becomes 

00:02:09.189 --> 00:02:12.510
 The amount of saline solution here is x 

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:17.189
 4280-x grams 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.879
 This part will be there 

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:24.069
 And the second voice 

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:27.450
 We will calculate the amount of salt that Fukuma has 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:39.230
 The amount of salt contained in 4% saline xfm 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.890
 It is 100 minutes that is X brand 

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:51.009
 There was the use of the staff included in 10% saline 480-x grams 

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:55.279
 480-x catheter 100 minutes 

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:57.980
 further 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:05.580
 City staff Tanigawa 480 * 1100 included in 8% saline 4280 grams 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.699
 Divided 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:11.589
 The amount of this salt and the amount of this salt 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.799
 Public funds because it is equal to the use of the entire salt 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.919
 It will be 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:20.799
 Let's go the other day 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:24.029
 One hundred and twenty four years 

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:26.209
 1/100 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.329
 Small 480-x 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.579
 equal 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.060
 The light is fine as it is 480 minutes in 100 minutes 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:37.449
 I think that is good here 

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:39.169
 Open to both 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.109
 There is also a title 

00:03:42.109 --> 00:03:44.809
 Each one does not multiply 100 times 

00:03:44.809 --> 00:03:47.299
 As soon as possible 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:52.599
 Organize and show 4x + tsu from now on 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:59.979
 4800 minus 19 x equal 480 is broken inside 

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.209
 The city is the 32nd place- 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.489
 3800 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.789
 406140 

00:04:07.789 --> 00:04:10.789
 It is that 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:15.069
 I will arrange high 

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.870
 Minus 6x recalled by Japanese x-10x 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.210
 380040 quality of offense 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:28.819
 With 4800 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.320
 After minus 6x 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.889
 I say high capacity 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:40.150
 Sumio Kagawa 42 to 960s2 to be packed 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.580
 i-I will communicate well 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:46.819
 I spoke of Japanese culture 

00:04:46.819 --> 00:04:51.830
 No 160 grams of 4% saline solution 

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:56.780
 And what should I mix each 1 gram 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:57.879
 Rich 

00:04:57.879 --> 00:05:03.180
 10% of those who calculate 480-three hundred sixty 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:09.000
 830020 cases for 6% saline solution 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.229
 4% saline solution is 160 yen 

00:05:15.229 --> 00:05:19.229
 Up to 320 grams of 6% saline 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.229
 I am answering 

00:05:24.029 --> 00:05:25.969
 here 

00:05:25.969 --> 00:05:26.990
 At first 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.990
 There is an overall cost of doing 

00:05:30.499 --> 00:05:33.379
 Should I mix 9 grams each 

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:37.169
 You are asked, but it doesn't matter 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.620
 If you say one x g 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.550
 One is the entire utilization 480-x grant 

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:48.719
 That is the point 

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:49.479
 Iga City dropped
