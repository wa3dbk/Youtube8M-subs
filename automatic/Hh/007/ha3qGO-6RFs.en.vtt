all right so here we've got two videos
where<00:00:56.399> we<00:00:56.579> use<00:00:56.789> our<00:00:57.030> easy<00:00:57.239> sink<00:00:57.629> to<00:00:58.050> trim<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
where we use our easy sink to trim the

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.280 
where we use our easy sink to trim the
clip<00:00:59.250> at<00:00:59.909> the<00:01:00.839> exact<00:01:01.769> same<00:01:02.039> point<00:01:03.170> we<00:01:04.170> can

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
clip at the exact same point we can

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.440 
clip at the exact same point we can
control<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.680> left<00:01:04.890> both<00:01:05.549> or<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.119> let's

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
control the left both or right let's

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.359 
control the left both or right let's
move<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.869> both<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.380> since<00:01:07.860> these<00:01:08.009> videos

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
move it to both and since these videos

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.279 
move it to both and since these videos
are<00:01:08.520> synced<00:01:08.909> let's<00:01:09.630> let<00:01:09.780> it<00:01:09.899> play<00:01:11.780> and<00:01:12.780> it<00:01:13.229> was

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
are synced let's let it play and it was

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.310 
are synced let's let it play and it was
all<00:01:13.470> about<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.890> sink<00:01:14.220> point<00:01:14.460> right<00:01:14.820> there<00:01:15.320> so

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
all about that sink point right there so

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.080 
all about that sink point right there so
let's<00:01:16.500> take<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.710> back<00:01:19.070> and<00:01:20.070> then<00:01:20.700> let's<00:01:20.880> let<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
let's take it back and then let's let it

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.809 
let's take it back and then let's let it
roll<00:01:21.270> forward<00:01:21.659> and<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:26.130> course<00:01:26.369> we<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.640> all

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
roll forward and of course we have all

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:30.410 
roll forward and of course we have all
the<00:01:26.970> telestrator<00:01:27.409> you<00:01:28.409> can<00:01:28.560> erase<00:01:29.210> can<00:01:30.210> to<00:01:30.299> get

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
the telestrator you can erase can to get

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.309 
the telestrator you can erase can to get
some<00:01:30.569> lines<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:31.140> in<00:01:31.380> there<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:32.759> can<00:01:32.909> undo

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
some lines going in there you can undo

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:36.440 
some lines going in there you can undo
get<00:01:34.319> another<00:01:34.560> line<00:01:34.770> in<00:01:34.799> there<00:01:35.130> here's<00:01:36.090> our<00:01:36.270> new

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
get another line in there here's our new

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.419 
get another line in there here's our new
zoom<00:01:36.750> capability<00:01:37.590> all<00:01:37.770> right<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.069> let's<00:01:38.250> take

00:01:38.419 --> 00:01:38.429 
zoom capability all right so let's take

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:39.800 
zoom capability all right so let's take
a<00:01:38.459> look<00:01:38.640> at<00:01:38.789> one<00:01:39.000> video

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
a look at one video

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.600 
a look at one video
load<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.259> up<00:01:40.380> this<00:01:40.649> is<00:01:40.770> loaded<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.069> over<00:01:41.429> here

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
load it up this is loaded up over here

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.990 
load it up this is loaded up over here
in<00:01:41.789> a<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.360> then<00:01:43.049> we<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.380> swap<00:01:43.649> over<00:01:43.709> to<00:01:44.039> B<00:01:44.759> and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
in a and then we can swap over to B and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.029 
in a and then we can swap over to B and
we<00:01:45.149> have<00:01:45.179> a<00:01:45.270> separate<00:01:45.600> video<00:01:45.780> or<00:01:46.289> we<00:01:46.709> can<00:01:46.860> put

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
we have a separate video or we can put

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.850 
we have a separate video or we can put
them<00:01:47.130> both<00:01:47.280> side<00:01:47.700> by<00:01:47.729> side<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.420> with<00:01:49.110> zoom<00:01:49.380> we

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
them both side by side and with zoom we

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.410 
them both side by side and with zoom we
have<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.190> ability<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.789> give<00:01:51.090> you<00:01:51.179> a<00:01:51.240> better

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
have the ability to give you a better

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.699 
have the ability to give you a better
look<00:01:53.060> at<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.119> focal<00:01:54.929> point<00:01:55.110> let's<00:01:55.289> move<00:01:55.470> these

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:55.709 
look at the focal point let's move these

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:57.919 
look at the focal point let's move these
guys<00:01:55.819> let's<00:01:56.819> put<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.119> bar<00:01:57.330> where<00:01:57.599> we<00:01:57.720> want

00:01:57.919 --> 00:01:57.929 
guys let's put the bar where we want

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:58.990 
guys let's put the bar where we want
them

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
them

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.779

alright<00:02:00.000> and<00:02:00.330> let's<00:02:00.539> go<00:02:00.840> frame<00:02:01.259> by<00:02:01.289> frame<00:02:01.789> and

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
alright and let's go frame by frame and

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:06.440 
alright and let's go frame by frame and
we<00:02:03.479> can<00:02:03.660> watch<00:02:03.840> them<00:02:04.379> go<00:02:04.679> over<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.940> bar<00:02:06.149> here

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
we can watch them go over the bar here

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.630 
we can watch them go over the bar here
and<00:02:07.519> of<00:02:08.519> course<00:02:09.349> we<00:02:10.349> can<00:02:10.530> do<00:02:11.400> some<00:02:11.610> work
