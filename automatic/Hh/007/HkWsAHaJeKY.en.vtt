so<00:01:39.720> youthful<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.070> so<00:01:42.060> good<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.420> have<00:01:42.840> no

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
so youthful and just so good I have no

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.780 
so youthful and just so good I have no
idea<00:01:43.260> why<00:01:43.440> maybe<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:43.890> because<00:01:43.979> of<00:01:44.190> the<00:01:44.340> hydro

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
idea why maybe it's because of the hydro

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.480 
idea why maybe it's because of the hydro
collagen<00:01:45.360> complex<00:01:45.810> in<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.140> or<00:01:46.380> because<00:01:47.280> of<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
collagen complex in it or because of the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.850 
collagen complex in it or because of the
little<00:01:47.760> tiny<00:01:47.970> bits<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.390> shimmer<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.650> just

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
little tiny bits of shimmer but it just

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.399 
little tiny bits of shimmer but it just
applies<00:01:50.370> really<00:01:51.030> well<00:01:51.180> to<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.479> skin<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:51.990> I

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
applies really well to your skin and I

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.590 
applies really well to your skin and I
also<00:01:52.590> love<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> fact<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.299> really

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
also love the fact that it's a really

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.780 
also love the fact that it's a really
thin<00:01:54.900> formula<00:01:55.530> now<00:01:56.100> I<00:01:56.130> kind<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.490> thought<00:01:56.640> at

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
thin formula now I kind of thought at

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.010 
thin formula now I kind of thought at
first<00:01:56.820> since<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.390> was<00:01:57.510> kind<00:01:57.720> of<00:01:57.750> a<00:01:57.840> thin

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
first since it was kind of a thin

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.080 
first since it was kind of a thin
formula<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:59.490> wasn't<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.909> to<00:01:59.970> be<00:02:00.060> very

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
formula that it wasn't going to be very

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
formula that it wasn't going to be very
good<00:02:00.450> coverage<00:02:00.900> but<00:02:01.140> it<00:02:01.320> actually<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.860> a

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
good coverage but it actually is a

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.399 
good coverage but it actually is a
medium<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.640> full<00:02:02.820> coverage<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.570> one<00:02:04.140> thing<00:02:04.320> I

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
medium to full coverage and one thing I

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.050 
medium to full coverage and one thing I
had<00:02:04.590> to<00:02:04.619> say<00:02:04.890> about<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:05.340> other<00:02:05.490> foundations

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
had to say about my other foundations

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.270 
had to say about my other foundations
I've<00:02:06.210> tried<00:02:06.510> is<00:02:06.720> that<00:02:06.900> you<00:02:07.619> know<00:02:07.740> they<00:02:07.950> start

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
I've tried is that you know they start

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.830 
I've tried is that you know they start
to<00:02:08.369> build<00:02:08.489> up<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:08.970> they<00:02:09.030> look<00:02:09.179> cakey<00:02:09.420> on<00:02:09.659> your

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
to build up and they look cakey on your

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.360 
to build up and they look cakey on your
skin<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.500> then<00:02:10.619> they<00:02:10.769> just<00:02:10.920> don't<00:02:11.069> look<00:02:11.310> good

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
skin and then they just don't look good

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.269 
skin and then they just don't look good
if<00:02:11.700> you<00:02:11.819> reapply<00:02:12.209> it<00:02:12.329> but<00:02:13.170> this<00:02:13.499> foundation<00:02:14.040> is

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:14.279 
if you reapply it but this foundation is

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:15.809 
if you reapply it but this foundation is
really<00:02:14.519> buildable<00:02:14.999> you<00:02:15.269> know<00:02:15.389> you<00:02:15.480> can

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
really buildable you know you can

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.660 
really buildable you know you can
at<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.299> end<00:02:16.450> of<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.659> day<00:02:16.840> or<00:02:17.319> even<00:02:17.980> apply<00:02:18.370> more

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
at the end of the day or even apply more

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.239 
at the end of the day or even apply more
to<00:02:18.700> get<00:02:19.030> more<00:02:19.299> of<00:02:19.629> a<00:02:19.900> coverage<00:02:20.349> and<00:02:20.650> you're<00:02:21.099> not

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:21.249 
to get more of a coverage and you're not

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:22.679 
to get more of a coverage and you're not
gonna<00:02:21.400> find<00:02:21.730> that<00:02:21.879> it<00:02:22.060> looks<00:02:22.239> cakey<00:02:22.659> or

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:22.689 
gonna find that it looks cakey or

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:24.809 
gonna find that it looks cakey or
anything<00:02:23.049> so<00:02:23.739> I<00:02:23.769> love<00:02:24.159> it<00:02:24.189> for<00:02:24.459> that<00:02:24.609> reason

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
anything so I love it for that reason

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.140 
anything so I love it for that reason
and<00:02:25.269> I<00:02:25.959> also<00:02:26.170> love<00:02:26.590> how<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.010> can<00:02:27.489> see<00:02:27.730> what's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
and I also love how you can see what's

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.750 
and I also love how you can see what's
left<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.659> actual<00:02:29.079> bottle<00:02:29.469> so<00:02:30.340> you<00:02:30.370> can<00:02:30.579> see

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:30.760 
left in the actual bottle so you can see

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.550 
left in the actual bottle so you can see
how<00:02:30.939> much<00:02:31.090> you've<00:02:31.329> used<00:02:31.359> here<00:02:31.930> because<00:02:32.409> I've

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
how much you've used here because I've

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.110 
how much you've used here because I've
noticed<00:02:32.709> other<00:02:33.189> products<00:02:33.670> in<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:33.849> drugstore

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
noticed other products in the drugstore

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.629 
noticed other products in the drugstore
I<00:02:34.659> mean<00:02:35.230> you<00:02:35.349> can't<00:02:35.560> tell<00:02:35.829> how<00:02:36.280> much<00:02:36.430> they've

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:36.639 
I mean you can't tell how much they've

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:38.940 
I mean you can't tell how much they've
used<00:02:36.879> because<00:02:37.120> there's<00:02:37.450> a<00:02:37.510> label<00:02:37.750> over<00:02:38.019> it<00:02:38.230> so

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
used because there's a label over it so

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.830 
used because there's a label over it so
I<00:02:38.980> love<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.549> can<00:02:39.760> see<00:02:39.939> how<00:02:40.180> much<00:02:40.359> product<00:02:40.750> I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
I love that I can see how much product I

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.839 
I love that I can see how much product I
have<00:02:40.989> left<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.769> if<00:02:42.069> I'm<00:02:42.250> running<00:02:42.370> out<00:02:42.609> or<00:02:42.730> not

00:02:42.839 --> 00:02:42.849 
have left and if I'm running out or not

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:44.490 
have left and if I'm running out or not
asked<00:02:43.510> for<00:02:43.689> the<00:02:43.840> other<00:02:43.959> things<00:02:44.260> I'm<00:02:44.409> not

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
asked for the other things I'm not

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.170 
asked for the other things I'm not
really<00:02:44.739> a<00:02:44.829> fan<00:02:45.159> of<00:02:45.189> with<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.549> foundation<00:02:46.060> I

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
really a fan of with this foundation I

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.459 
really a fan of with this foundation I
just<00:02:46.359> thought<00:02:46.510> I<00:02:46.569> would<00:02:46.810> mention<00:02:46.959> them<00:02:47.260> so<00:02:47.409> you

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:47.469 
just thought I would mention them so you

00:02:47.469 --> 00:02:50.250 
just thought I would mention them so you
guys<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:47.829> aware<00:02:47.950> but<00:02:48.159> I<00:02:48.760> find<00:02:49.480> that<00:02:49.629> it<00:02:50.019> does

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
guys are aware but I find that it does

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.920 
guys are aware but I find that it does
start<00:02:50.530> to<00:02:50.650> fade<00:02:50.889> over<00:02:51.159> I<00:02:51.760> would<00:02:51.909> say<00:02:52.090> eight<00:02:52.780> or

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
start to fade over I would say eight or

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.720 
start to fade over I would say eight or
nine<00:02:53.079> hours<00:02:53.109> which<00:02:53.739> I<00:02:54.010> mean<00:02:54.400> it's<00:02:54.609> pretty

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
nine hours which I mean it's pretty

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.640 
nine hours which I mean it's pretty
standard<00:02:55.239> with<00:02:55.389> drugstore<00:02:55.959> foundations

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
standard with drugstore foundations

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.110 
standard with drugstore foundations
you're<00:02:56.829> gonna<00:02:56.980> find<00:02:57.219> that<00:02:57.459> it<00:02:57.609> doesn't<00:02:57.939> last

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
you're gonna find that it doesn't last

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.649 
you're gonna find that it doesn't last
all<00:02:58.449> day<00:02:58.750> long<00:02:58.959> or<00:02:59.260> 24<00:03:00.159> hours<00:03:00.489> but<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:01.090> don't

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:01.659 
all day long or 24 hours but I don't

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:03.569 
all day long or 24 hours but I don't
find<00:03:01.900> it's<00:03:02.230> too<00:03:02.349> big<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.530> a<00:03:02.709> problem<00:03:02.949> I<00:03:03.280> mean<00:03:03.310> I

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:03.579 
find it's too big of a problem I mean I

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:05.129 
find it's too big of a problem I mean I
think<00:03:03.790> it<00:03:03.909> lasts<00:03:04.329> long<00:03:04.569> enough<00:03:04.599> throughout

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:05.139 
think it lasts long enough throughout

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:06.899 
think it lasts long enough throughout
the<00:03:05.290> day<00:03:05.439> it's<00:03:05.709> not<00:03:05.769> going<00:03:06.069> to<00:03:06.129> completely

00:03:06.899 --> 00:03:06.909 
the day it's not going to completely

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.909 
the day it's not going to completely
fade<00:03:07.299> off<00:03:07.510> or<00:03:07.870> melt<00:03:08.169> off<00:03:08.349> your<00:03:08.560> face<00:03:08.709> or

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:08.919 
fade off or melt off your face or

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:11.009 
fade off or melt off your face or
anything<00:03:09.069> but<00:03:09.459> just<00:03:10.239> to<00:03:10.359> make<00:03:10.510> sure<00:03:10.540> that<00:03:10.900> it

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
anything but just to make sure that it

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.929 
anything but just to make sure that it
does<00:03:11.230> last<00:03:11.500> really<00:03:11.829> long<00:03:11.859> I<00:03:12.310> always<00:03:12.489> set<00:03:12.819> it

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
does last really long I always set it

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.720 
does last really long I always set it
with<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.449> powder<00:03:13.510> just<00:03:14.260> to<00:03:14.379> make<00:03:14.560> sure<00:03:14.799> that<00:03:15.099> you

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
with a powder just to make sure that you

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.339 
with a powder just to make sure that you
know<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:16.000> completely<00:03:16.150> sets<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.079> then<00:03:17.199> it's

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:17.349 
know it completely sets and then it's

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.750 
know it completely sets and then it's
just<00:03:17.500> gonna<00:03:17.620> stay<00:03:17.889> put<00:03:18.129> throughout<00:03:18.459> the<00:03:18.579> day

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:18.760 
just gonna stay put throughout the day

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.909 
just gonna stay put throughout the day
but<00:03:19.060> I<00:03:19.299> mean<00:03:19.959> I<00:03:19.989> think<00:03:20.079> it<00:03:20.349> generally<00:03:20.739> does

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:20.919 
but I mean I think it generally does

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.369 
but I mean I think it generally does
last<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.609> pretty<00:03:21.970> long<00:03:22.150> time<00:03:22.359> another<00:03:23.109> thing

00:03:23.369 --> 00:03:23.379 
last a pretty long time another thing

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:25.530 
last a pretty long time another thing
that<00:03:23.590> I<00:03:23.620> just<00:03:24.220> wanted<00:03:24.699> you<00:03:24.790> guys<00:03:24.909> to<00:03:24.970> know<00:03:25.150> is

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
that I just wanted you guys to know is

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.390 
that I just wanted you guys to know is
that<00:03:25.780> because<00:03:26.500> it<00:03:26.620> does<00:03:26.769> have<00:03:26.949> the<00:03:27.159> brush

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
that because it does have the brush

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.059 
that because it does have the brush
applicator<00:03:28.000> it<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.449> kind<00:03:28.810> of<00:03:28.900> annoying<00:03:29.709> to

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
applicator it is kind of annoying to

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.399 
applicator it is kind of annoying to
apply<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.909> this<00:03:31.359> is<00:03:31.509> what<00:03:31.659> it<00:03:31.720> looks<00:03:31.870> like<00:03:31.930> here

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:32.409 
apply so this is what it looks like here

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.740 
apply so this is what it looks like here
and<00:03:32.819> basically<00:03:33.819> what<00:03:33.970> you<00:03:34.060> do<00:03:34.239> is<00:03:34.540> you<00:03:34.720> just

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
and basically what you do is you just

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.050 
and basically what you do is you just
twist<00:03:35.439> it<00:03:35.560> up<00:03:35.709> and<00:03:35.769> then<00:03:36.280> the<00:03:36.459> foundation<00:03:36.939> is

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:37.060 
twist it up and then the foundation is

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.819 
twist it up and then the foundation is
going<00:03:37.239> to<00:03:37.299> come<00:03:37.479> out<00:03:37.599> right<00:03:38.439> through<00:03:38.650> the

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
going to come out right through the

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.009 
going to come out right through the
middle<00:03:39.099> of<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.459> brush<00:03:39.699> here<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:40.209> what<00:03:40.720> I<00:03:40.750> find

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
middle of the brush here and what I find

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.229 
middle of the brush here and what I find
works<00:03:41.169> best<00:03:41.530> is<00:03:41.799> I<00:03:41.919> just<00:03:42.129> dot<00:03:42.400> it<00:03:42.609> all<00:03:42.819> over<00:03:43.090> my

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
works best is I just dot it all over my

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.270 
works best is I just dot it all over my
face<00:03:43.269> and<00:03:43.930> then<00:03:44.470> I'll<00:03:44.590> take<00:03:44.769> a<00:03:44.799> step<00:03:45.069> like

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
face and then I'll take a step like

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.210 
face and then I'll take a step like
brush<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.819> just<00:03:45.939> blend<00:03:46.150> it<00:03:46.389> all<00:03:46.479> in<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.889> mean

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
brush and just blend it all in so I mean

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.589 
brush and just blend it all in so I mean
the<00:03:48.370> thing<00:03:48.400> with<00:03:48.639> the<00:03:48.759> brush<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.239> that<00:03:49.389> it's

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
the thing with the brush is that it's

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.330 
the thing with the brush is that it's
kind<00:03:49.810> of<00:03:49.900> unsanitary<00:03:50.650> to<00:03:50.889> have<00:03:51.069> the

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
kind of unsanitary to have the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:53.939 
kind of unsanitary to have the
foundation<00:03:51.669> build<00:03:52.060> up<00:03:52.180> over<00:03:52.540> it<00:03:52.629> so<00:03:52.959> you're

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
foundation build up over it so you're

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.099 
foundation build up over it so you're
obviously<00:03:54.069> gonna<00:03:54.430> have<00:03:54.669> to<00:03:54.879> clean<00:03:55.359> it<00:03:55.389> off<00:03:55.629> but

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
obviously gonna have to clean it off but

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.469 
obviously gonna have to clean it off but
I<00:03:56.379> just<00:03:57.340> I<00:03:57.549> don't<00:03:57.669> know<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:57.849> wish<00:03:58.120> they<00:03:58.329> would

00:03:58.469 --> 00:03:58.479 
I just I don't know I wish they would

00:03:58.479 --> 00:04:00.179 
I just I don't know I wish they would
have<00:03:58.599> had<00:03:58.870> a<00:03:58.900> pump<00:03:59.409> with<00:03:59.650> this<00:03:59.799> particular

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:00.189 
have had a pump with this particular

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:02.280 
have had a pump with this particular
formula<00:04:01.090> I<00:04:01.299> mean<00:04:01.449> I<00:04:01.479> know<00:04:01.599> that<00:04:01.959> they<00:04:02.079> have

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
formula I mean I know that they have

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:04.439 
formula I mean I know that they have
other<00:04:02.949> visible<00:04:03.400> lift<00:04:03.639> ones<00:04:03.969> that<00:04:04.180> don't<00:04:04.329> have

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:04.449 
other visible lift ones that don't have

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:07.050 
other visible lift ones that don't have
the<00:04:04.659> brush<00:04:04.870> but<00:04:05.199> I<00:04:05.469> would<00:04:06.040> just<00:04:06.189> like<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.549> see<00:04:06.759> a

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
the brush but I would just like to see a

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:09.539 
the brush but I would just like to see a
different<00:04:07.810> kind<00:04:07.989> of<00:04:08.019> applicator<00:04:08.530> for<00:04:09.009> this

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
different kind of applicator for this

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.699 
different kind of applicator for this
specific<00:04:10.180> formula<00:04:10.719> the<00:04:11.319> last<00:04:11.469> thing<00:04:11.620> I<00:04:11.680> just

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709 
specific formula the last thing I just

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.959 
specific formula the last thing I just
want<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:12.039> mention<00:04:12.310> about<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.819> foundation

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:12.969 
want to mention about this foundation

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.059 
want to mention about this foundation
and<00:04:13.659> I've<00:04:14.109> already<00:04:14.289> kind<00:04:14.530> of<00:04:14.680> touched<00:04:14.859> on<00:04:15.009> it

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
and I've already kind of touched on it

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:17.849 
and I've already kind of touched on it
before<00:04:15.280> but<00:04:15.819> I<00:04:16.120> don't<00:04:17.049> think<00:04:17.199> that<00:04:17.380> has<00:04:17.590> that

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
before but I don't think that has that

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.740 
before but I don't think that has that
much<00:04:18.039> product<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.669> it<00:04:18.820> for<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.509> drugstore

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
much product in it for a drugstore

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.110 
much product in it for a drugstore
foundation<00:04:20.500> I've<00:04:20.680> definitely<00:04:20.919> seen<00:04:21.459> products

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
foundation I've definitely seen products

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.480 
foundation I've definitely seen products
with<00:04:22.330> more<00:04:22.599> foundation<00:04:23.169> in<00:04:23.349> them<00:04:23.560> so<00:04:24.219> you<00:04:24.310> can

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:24.490 
with more foundation in them so you can

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.010 
with more foundation in them so you can
see<00:04:24.639> here<00:04:24.940> I<00:04:24.969> mean<00:04:25.180> I<00:04:25.210> haven't<00:04:25.570> even<00:04:25.630> had<00:04:25.870> it

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
see here I mean I haven't even had it

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.620 
see here I mean I haven't even had it
that<00:04:26.139> long<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.620> I've<00:04:26.740> already<00:04:27.190> gone<00:04:27.430> through

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
that long and I've already gone through

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.140 
that long and I've already gone through
half<00:04:28.630> of<00:04:28.810> it

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:29.150 
half of it

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.560 
half of it
ready<00:04:29.360> so<00:04:29.870> I<00:04:30.400> just<00:04:31.400> wish<00:04:31.580> that<00:04:31.850> I<00:04:31.910> came<00:04:32.510> with
