 Hello, my dear friends, dear 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.800
 viewers followers with you Anton and this 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.140
 my 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:19.540
 informational video i even have podcasts 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.270
 I canâ€™t say what will happen 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:25.540
 on yesterday 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.820
 August 11 , I posted the last 29 part 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:30.340
 passing game black jackets and in 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.010
 comments a crowd of people who 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.640
 began to very vigorously discuss about what 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.200
 everything will be on my channel 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.989
 divided into three groups 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.540
 the first group are people who 

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.720
 wondering what will happen next I 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:50.710
 I understand often very important such 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:54.100
 the liveliest question the second group is the people 

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.579
 who really wants the passage of a mod for 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.320
 the second assault which is called the cook 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.109
 just fill me up with requests 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.620
 it even seems like passing requirements 

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:08.710
 I have answered this mod a thousand times and will answer 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:10.390
 again no I will not pass Alba 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.370
 guys if you want to see it 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.690
 find on the internet i think somebody 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.730
 already hurry up and did it 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.190
 the passage 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:21.190
 Well, the third group of people are those who 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.190
 absolutely sure that I will pass 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.760
 saboteurs vietnam 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.440
 that post in the VKontakte group which I 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:33.070
 did and there I talked about saboteurs 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:35.710
 vietnam he means nothing 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.920
 in terms of what I will absolutely 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.560
 to pass this game, I just assumed 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.200
 my possibilities are not as i am now 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.960
 stress now not related to my 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.040
 desires therefore 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.290
 one hundred percent claim that saboteurs 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.000
 Vietnam will or will not 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.130
 I cant 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.470

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.150
 life relocation all things but i don't have to 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.460

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.479

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.900
 personal life but I understand that people are waiting 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:11.020

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:15.459

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.550
