watchdog<00:00:13.980> right<00:00:14.250> no<00:00:14.490> Claymore<00:00:15.330> he<00:00:15.660> sets<00:00:15.990> up

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
watchdog right no Claymore he sets up

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.439 
watchdog right no Claymore he sets up
proximity<00:00:16.770> mines<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.880> if<00:00:17.940> you<00:00:18.029> lay<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.240> on<00:00:18.359> the

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
proximity mines so if you lay it on the

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.140 
proximity mines so if you lay it on the
ground<00:00:18.480> and<00:00:18.930> a<00:00:18.990> a<00:00:19.640> Decepticon<00:00:20.640> walks<00:00:20.910> body

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
ground and a a Decepticon walks body

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.210 
ground and a a Decepticon walks body
it'll<00:00:21.720> blow<00:00:22.020> up<00:00:22.260> and<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.680> it's<00:00:22.859> under<00:00:23.100> their

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
it'll blow up and if it's under their

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.519 
it'll blow up and if it's under their
feet<00:00:23.550> they'll<00:00:23.910> go<00:00:24.029> flying<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.779> air<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.260> so

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
feet they'll go flying in the air is so

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.320 
feet they'll go flying in the air is so
funny<00:00:25.859> it's<00:00:26.609> even<00:00:26.849> better<00:00:26.970> when<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.210> can

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330

physics<00:00:35.730> in<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.300> game<00:00:36.390> are<00:00:36.719> absolutely

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
physics in this game are absolutely

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.459 
physics in this game are absolutely
hilarious<00:00:37.469> like<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.219> frequently<00:00:39.200> done<00:00:40.200> one<00:00:40.350> of

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
hilarious like I frequently done one of

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.869 
hilarious like I frequently done one of
those<00:00:40.559> where<00:00:40.980> one<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.309> those<00:00:41.489> things<00:00:41.730> where<00:00:41.850> I

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
those where one of those things where I

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.959 
those where one of those things where I
transform<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.960> pick<00:00:43.860> up<00:00:44.010> speed<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.610> then<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
transform I pick up speed and then I

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.260 
transform I pick up speed and then I
transform<00:00:45.870> into<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:47.070> robot<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.000> get<00:00:48.149> uh<00:00:48.180> some

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
transform into a robot and I get uh some

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.439 
transform into a robot and I get uh some
boost<00:00:48.539> of<00:00:48.690> speed<00:00:48.780> like<00:00:49.110> that<00:00:49.379> out<00:00:50.210> yeah<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.239> I

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
boost of speed like that out yeah and I

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.110 
boost of speed like that out yeah and I
pretty<00:00:51.690> much<00:00:51.780> hit<00:00:52.230> a<00:00:52.260> tree<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.010> then<00:00:53.579> I<00:00:53.610> go

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
pretty much hit a tree and then I go

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.029 
pretty much hit a tree and then I go
around<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.690> were<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> wrap<00:00:55.320> around<00:00:55.739> it<00:00:55.980> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
around I were like wrap around it and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.790 
around I were like wrap around it and
it's<00:00:56.520> crazy<00:00:57.030> it's<00:00:57.449> crazy<00:00:57.480> dude<00:00:58.079> it's<00:00:58.530> crazy

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
it's crazy it's crazy dude it's crazy

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.099 
it's crazy it's crazy dude it's crazy
and<00:00:59.460> actually<00:00:59.940> in<00:01:00.059> these<00:01:00.149> ravines<00:01:00.510> as<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> data

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
and actually in these ravines as a data

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.820 
and actually in these ravines as a data
continents<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.129> high<00:01:02.340> cliff<00:01:03.019> and<00:01:04.019> we

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
continents up on a high cliff and we

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.670 
continents up on a high cliff and we
need<00:01:05.390> slipstream<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.659> get<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.049> which<00:01:07.470> we'll

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
need slipstream to get that which we'll

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.330 
need slipstream to get that which we'll
be<00:01:07.710> getting<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:09.000> level<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.830> in<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:10.920> play<00:01:11.130> at<00:01:11.310> a

is probably you'll be using this

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.700 
is probably you'll be using this

throughout the majority of the game this

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.800 
throughout the majority of the game this
is<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.040> shield<00:01:35.550> Minicon<00:01:36.119> there<00:01:36.330> are<00:01:36.390> three<00:01:36.659> of

these in the game protecting its

container we have our second rocket

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.179 
container we have our second rocket
Minicon<00:03:24.200> this<00:03:24.799> is<00:03:24.980> flashbang<00:03:25.760> actually<00:03:26.480> on

00:03:27.179 --> 00:03:27.189 
Minicon this is flashbang actually on

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.649 
Minicon this is flashbang actually on
flashbang<00:03:28.189> rocket<00:03:28.819> launcher<00:03:29.180> now<00:03:29.299> this<00:03:29.510> is

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659 
flashbang rocket launcher now this is

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.369 
flashbang rocket launcher now this is
better<00:03:29.900> than<00:03:30.079> walk<00:03:30.260> on<00:03:31.870> however<00:03:32.870> we<00:03:33.049> did<00:03:33.260> just

00:03:33.369 --> 00:03:33.379 
better than walk on however we did just

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:35.259 
better than walk on however we did just
lose<00:03:33.620> our<00:03:33.799> boost<00:03:34.069> of<00:03:34.250> two<00:03:34.459> Reds<00:03:34.760> but<00:03:35.060> the<00:03:35.120> thing

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
lose our boost of two Reds but the thing

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.390 
lose our boost of two Reds but the thing
is<00:03:35.299> look<00:03:35.930> at<00:03:36.049> how<00:03:36.139> much<00:03:36.319> more<00:03:36.709> powerful<00:03:37.069> it<00:03:37.280> is

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
is look at how much more powerful it is

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.289 
is look at how much more powerful it is
because<00:03:37.579> flashbang<00:03:38.540> fires<00:03:38.810> two<00:03:39.370> missiles<00:03:40.370> but

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
because flashbang fires two missiles but

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.640 
because flashbang fires two missiles but
they<00:03:41.450> don't<00:03:41.629> walk<00:03:41.780> on

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
they don't walk on

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.149 
they don't walk on
so<00:03:44.190> it's<00:03:44.360> incredibly<00:03:45.360> powerful<00:03:45.629> oh<00:03:46.170> and<00:03:46.860> if

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:47.159 
so it's incredibly powerful oh and if

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:49.670 
so it's incredibly powerful oh and if
you're<00:03:47.280> too<00:03:47.430> close<00:03:47.640> to<00:03:47.700> a<00:03:47.879> wall<00:03:48.269> or<00:03:48.930> someone

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
you're too close to a wall or someone

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.920 
you're too close to a wall or someone
and<00:03:49.950> he<00:03:50.159> blasts<00:03:50.790> whatever's<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.480> front<00:03:51.720> of<00:03:51.810> you

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:51.930 
and he blasts whatever's in front of you

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.699 
and he blasts whatever's in front of you
with<00:03:53.239> flashbang<00:03:54.239> you'll<00:03:54.959> wind<00:03:55.349> up<00:03:55.530> actually

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
with flashbang you'll wind up actually

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.619 
with flashbang you'll wind up actually
blowing<00:03:56.549> yourself<00:03:56.610> backwards<00:03:57.360> because<00:03:57.420> the
