all<00:00:46.809> so<00:00:47.050> you<00:00:47.109> I<00:00:47.559> think<00:00:47.769> that's<00:00:47.920> the<00:00:48.359> the<00:00:49.359> one

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
all so you I think that's the the one

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:51.059 
all so you I think that's the the one
that<00:00:49.690> keeps<00:00:49.839> you<00:00:49.960> invisible<00:00:50.170> invisibility

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:51.069 
that keeps you invisible invisibility
