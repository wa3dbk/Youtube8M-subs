that when you if a person if a player's
in<00:00:14.160> them<00:00:14.340> then<00:00:14.910> they<00:00:15.210> get<00:00:15.690> released<00:00:15.839> back<00:00:16.320> into

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
in them then they get released back into

whatever<00:00:16.740> my<00:00:17.100> car<00:00:17.310> track<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:17.730> want<00:00:17.910> and<00:00:18.150> if

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
whatever my car track you want and if

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.330 
whatever my car track you want and if
they<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.199> no<00:00:19.380> person<00:00:19.710> had<00:00:19.830> none<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.100> I<00:00:20.160> keep

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
they have no person had none that I keep

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.929 
they have no person had none that I keep
circulating<00:00:20.689> all<00:00:21.689> right<00:00:21.810> here<00:00:21.990> we<00:00:22.020> go<00:00:22.850> so<00:00:23.850> as

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
circulating all right here we go so as

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.370 
circulating all right here we go so as
you<00:00:24.029> can<00:00:24.180> see<00:00:24.359> here<00:00:24.570> we<00:00:24.660> got<00:00:24.810> a<00:00:24.840> pretty<00:00:25.080> simple

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
you can see here we got a pretty simple

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:34.450 
you can see here we got a pretty simple
setup<00:00:25.800> going<00:00:27.949> um<00:00:29.119> it's<00:00:30.119> basically<00:00:30.720> just<00:00:31.489> a

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
setup going um it's basically just a

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.780 
setup going um it's basically just a
basically<00:00:35.460> just<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.880> at<00:00:36.030> one<00:00:36.210> of<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:37.790> infinite

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
basically just a at one of the infinite

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.310 
basically just a at one of the infinite
minecart<00:00:39.210> boosters<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.960> showed<00:00:40.200> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
minecart boosters that we showed you

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.530 
minecart boosters that we showed you
earlier<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.739> an<00:00:41.070> extra<00:00:41.370> track<00:00:41.640> with<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> small

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
earlier and an extra track with a small

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.500 
earlier and an extra track with a small
red<00:00:42.840> stone<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.550> small<00:00:44.550> redstone<00:00:45.000> circuit<00:00:45.239> as

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
red stone a small redstone circuit as

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.700 
red stone a small redstone circuit as
you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.750> see<00:00:45.899> right<00:00:45.930> over<00:00:46.140> there<00:00:46.469> I'm

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
you can see right over there I'm

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.119 
you can see right over there I'm
pointing<00:00:46.950> and<00:00:47.280> what<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.360> should<00:00:48.539> do<00:00:49.129> well

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
pointing and what this should do well

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.660 
pointing and what this should do well
for<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:50.460> explain<00:00:50.789> so<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:52.190> stone<00:00:53.190> pressure

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
for some explain so the stone pressure

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.150 
for some explain so the stone pressure
plate<00:00:54.030> is<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.270> great<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:55.050> in<00:00:55.320> mine<00:00:55.800> cards

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
plate is a great use in mine cards

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.090 
plate is a great use in mine cards
because<00:00:56.750> it<00:00:57.750> it's<00:00:58.170> basically<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.949> mine

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
because it it's basically if the mine

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.860 
because it it's basically if the mine
cards<00:00:59.309> are<00:00:59.399> going<00:00:59.550> I<00:00:59.609> has<00:00:59.789> speed<00:01:00.120> it<00:01:00.329> basically

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
cards are going I has speed it basically

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
cards are going I has speed it basically
functions<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> track<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.039> you<00:01:02.160> can<00:01:02.309> see<00:01:02.489> my

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
functions as a track as you can see my

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.600 
functions as a track as you can see my
car<00:01:03.059> just<00:01:03.239> go<00:01:03.390> right<00:01:03.539> over<00:01:03.600> it<00:01:03.899> but<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:05.040> does

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
car just go right over it but it does

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.399 
car just go right over it but it does
it's<00:01:05.820> not<00:01:06.000> activated<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.810> you're<00:01:06.930> just<00:01:07.140> at<00:01:07.350> my

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it's not activated if you're just at my

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.440 
it's not activated if you're just at my
cart<00:01:07.860> with<00:01:08.250> nobody<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.670> it<00:01:08.850> goes<00:01:09.060> across<00:01:09.240> it

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
cart with nobody and it goes across it

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.270 
cart with nobody and it goes across it
like<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.689> can<00:01:09.780> see<00:01:09.900> here<00:01:10.110> but<00:01:10.500> if<00:01:10.680> a<00:01:10.740> person<00:01:11.159> is

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
like you can see here but if a person is

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.890 
like you can see here but if a person is
in<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.580> then<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.290> then<00:01:13.290> it's<00:01:13.500> activated<00:01:13.920> so

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:14.900 
in it then the then it's activated so

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.179 
in it then the then it's activated so
what<00:01:15.900> should<00:01:16.080> happen<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.710> I've<00:01:16.860> hooked<00:01:16.979> up

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
what should happen is I've hooked up

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.039 
what should happen is I've hooked up
this<00:01:17.310> redstone<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> piece<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.750> track

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
this redstone to a to a piece of track

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.359 
this redstone to a to a piece of track
over<00:01:22.229> here<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.560> piece<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> track<00:01:23.130> should

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
over here that piece of track should

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.880 
over here that piece of track should
change<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.150> flip<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.810> it<00:01:25.409> should<00:01:25.619> flip<00:01:25.770> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
change and flip it it should flip the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.230 
change and flip it it should flip the
track<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.310> other<00:01:26.460> way<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.759> i'll<00:01:26.970> end<00:01:27.119> up

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
track the other way so that i'll end up

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.760 
track the other way so that i'll end up
going<00:01:27.479> around<00:01:27.720> right<00:01:27.960> here<00:01:27.990> and<00:01:28.409> back<00:01:28.590> into

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
going around right here and back into

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
going around right here and back into
the<00:01:28.920> circulation<00:01:29.310> and<00:01:31.100> what<00:01:32.100> the<00:01:32.189> heck<00:01:33.020> okay

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
the circulation and what the heck okay

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.890 
the circulation and what the heck okay
well<00:01:34.729> hey<00:01:35.729> that<00:01:36.060> real<00:01:36.240> quick<00:01:38.450> all<00:01:39.450> right<00:01:39.689> now

let's justice
see<00:01:43.270> I<00:01:43.570> went<00:01:44.140> around<00:01:44.260> off<00:01:44.860> the<00:01:44.980> track<00:01:45.220> and

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
see I went around off the track and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.740 
see I went around off the track and
there<00:01:47.020> you<00:01:47.110> have<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.640> so<00:01:48.640> basically<00:01:49.210> it<00:01:49.510> this

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
there you have it so basically it this

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.010 
there you have it so basically it this
one's<00:01:49.990> a<00:01:50.110> rather<00:01:50.260> small<00:01:50.530> example<00:01:51.220> of<00:01:51.720> my<00:01:52.720> cart

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
one's a rather small example of my cart

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.990 
one's a rather small example of my cart
booster<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:53.890> a<00:01:54.010> station<00:01:54.490> but<00:01:54.640> you<00:01:54.820> could

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
booster and a station but you could

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.820 
booster and a station but you could
really<00:01:55.270> make<00:01:55.420> this<00:01:55.660> part<00:01:55.900> right<00:01:55.960> here<00:01:56.080> go

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 
really make this part right here go

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.540 
really make this part right here go
anywhere<00:01:57.130> you<00:01:57.190> want<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:58.290> could<00:01:59.290> go<00:01:59.500> off<00:01:59.800> to

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
anywhere you want this could go off to

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.250 
anywhere you want this could go off to
your<00:02:01.120> I<00:02:01.150> don't<00:02:01.630> know<00:02:01.720> whatever<00:02:01.930> you<00:02:02.110> have

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:02.260 
your I don't know whatever you have
