00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:51.439 
it it's a super amoled advanced display

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.380 
it it's a super amoled advanced display
and<00:01:52.439> so<00:01:52.799> what<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.130> offers<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> qHD

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
and so what that offers is qHD

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.050 
and so what that offers is qHD
resolution<00:01:55.820> in<00:01:56.820> an<00:01:57.479> enamel<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:59.000> display<00:02:00.000> so

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
resolution in an enamel that display so

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.859
