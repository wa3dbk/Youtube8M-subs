00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.280
 or 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.029
 do not 

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.009
 t 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.009
 a ray corresponds to a powerful 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.289
 natural electrostatic discharge that 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:34.230
 produces between a cloud and the surface or 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.470
 between two clouds the air from the point 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:39.090
 of electric sight is a good insulator 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.430
 so that a storm is made and 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.650
 can produce a beam it is required that 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 cumulus clouds have nimbus one 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:47.519
 dense and powerful cloud of dimension 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.400
 considerable vertical in the form of 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.440
 mountain or huge towers when that 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.140
 cloud is made anvil shape then it 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.089
 It can be classified as storm too 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.129
 the phenomenon is called cells of 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:01.260
 storm and when they start to spin 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.299
 about themselves and acquire enough 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.489
 energy are called super cells of 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.000
 storm causing tornadoes and 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.100
 fatal hailstorms and very powerful rays 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.900
 and as we explained the lightning occurs 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.729
 whenever that two loop that could be 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.799
 the earth produce a potential 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.409
 very distant electric and turn the super 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:22.049
 cells together can produce rays 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.920
 from strong to very powerful in your 

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.780
 trajectory 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.970
 the ray carries electric currents 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.400
 that can reach as a mean 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.659
 30,000 amps for millionths of 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.460
 second with potential 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.409
 that have been estimated in values 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.539
 that exceeded 15 million 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.920
 volts can reach even the 

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.810
 200 million but what about the lightning 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.609
 the temperature increase in the points 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.920
 where the discharge goes to a 

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.810
 value close to 30,000 centigrade and the 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.789
 sudden increase in pressure due to 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 associated heating generate a large 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:55.079
 luminosity and sound waves that 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.000
 they constitute the thunder the speed of 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.399
 propagation of sound in the air is of 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.469
 order of 1200 kilometers per hour of 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.479
 so that the time elapsed between the 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:05.159
 sighting of lightning and thunder 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.959
 allows to estimate the distance of 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:10.049
 observer to the point of occurrence of 

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:13.009
 lightning remember if you liked the video give
