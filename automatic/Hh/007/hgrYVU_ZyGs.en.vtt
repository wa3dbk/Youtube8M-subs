00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
now we used a whisk however it did start

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.310 
now we used a whisk however it did start
to<00:01:50.579> get<00:01:50.759> clumpy<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.450> whisk<00:01:51.659> so<00:01:51.990> we<00:01:52.110> had<00:01:52.200> to

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
to get clumpy in the whisk so we had to

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.310 
to get clumpy in the whisk so we had to
switch<00:01:52.590> over<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:52.920> just<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.430> spatula<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:54.600> you

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
switch over to just a spatula so you

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.319 
switch over to just a spatula so you
know<00:01:55.439> make<00:01:56.250> your<00:01:56.399> own<00:01:56.430> decisions<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.149> guess

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
and mix it in here you can see we're

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.340 
and mix it in here you can see we're
using<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.189> spatula<00:02:05.549> and<00:02:06.060> once<00:02:06.659> all<00:02:06.899> those<00:02:07.140> are

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
using the spatula and once all those are

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:08.479 
using the spatula and once all those are
mixed<00:02:07.619> in<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.890> want<00:02:08.069> to<00:02:08.129> add<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.459> your
