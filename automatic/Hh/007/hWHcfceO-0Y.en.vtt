childhood back to life

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.820 
childhood back to life
I<00:01:57.700> assume<00:01:58.700> every<00:01:59.630> video<00:01:59.780> game<00:01:59.900> designer<00:02:00.470> has

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
I assume every video game designer has

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.500 
I assume every video game designer has
like<00:02:01.190> a<00:02:01.550> similar<00:02:02.270> feeling<00:02:02.800> so<00:02:04.390> it's<00:02:05.390> just

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:05.510 
like a similar feeling so it's just

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.270 
like a similar feeling so it's just
something<00:02:05.780> that<00:02:05.960> you've<00:02:06.890> always<00:02:07.040> been

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
something that you've always been

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.889 
something that you've always been
passionate<00:02:07.490> about<00:02:07.850> it's<00:02:08.210> not<00:02:08.330> something<00:02:08.780> that

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
passionate about it's not something that

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.680 
passionate about it's not something that
feels<00:02:09.200> like<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:10.490> ever<00:02:10.729> left<00:02:11.090> it's<00:02:11.360> not<00:02:11.420> like

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
feels like it ever left it's not like

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.110 
feels like it ever left it's not like
you're<00:02:12.040> being<00:02:13.040> reborn<00:02:13.460> in<00:02:13.760> your<00:02:13.880> childhood

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
you're being reborn in your childhood

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.870 
you're being reborn in your childhood
coming<00:02:14.600> back<00:02:14.780> it's<00:02:15.650> always<00:02:15.830> been<00:02:16.100> there<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.850> I

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
coming back it's always been there so I

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.430 
coming back it's always been there so I
guess<00:02:17.090> it's<00:02:17.240> finally<00:02:17.630> like<00:02:17.810> the<00:02:18.080> ability<00:02:18.230> to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
guess it's finally like the ability to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.290 
guess it's finally like the ability to
share<00:02:18.800> another<00:02:19.190> extension<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:20.060> something

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
share another extension of something

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.600 
share another extension of something

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.030 
nice and okay this is a 2d platformer
and<00:02:25.880> it's<00:02:26.120> pretty<00:02:26.510> hardcore<00:02:26.870> but<00:02:27.350> if<00:02:27.530> you

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
and it's pretty hardcore but if you

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:30.610 
and it's pretty hardcore but if you

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620

skill<00:02:30.920> of<00:02:31.220> 2d<00:02:31.700> platformers<00:02:32.150> where<00:02:32.480> would<00:02:32.600> you

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
skill of 2d platformers where would you

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.690 
skill of 2d platformers where would you
put<00:02:32.840> it<00:02:32.900> if<00:02:33.140> you<00:02:33.230> Megaman<00:02:33.860> and<00:02:34.160> it's<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.520> top

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
put it if you Megaman and it's the top

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.380 
put it if you Megaman and it's the top
or<00:02:34.970> something

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
or something

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.360 
or something
um<00:02:35.630> well<00:02:36.590> our<00:02:36.980> game<00:02:37.250> has<00:02:37.670> a<00:02:38.500> sliding<00:02:39.500> scale<00:02:40.340> of

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:40.370 
um well our game has a sliding scale of

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:42.970 
um well our game has a sliding scale of
range<00:02:40.970> so<00:02:41.420> I<00:02:41.450> mean<00:02:41.990> it<00:02:42.440> would<00:02:42.590> definitely<00:02:42.710> be

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:42.980 
range so I mean it would definitely be

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.870 
range so I mean it would definitely be
the<00:02:44.560> easier<00:02:45.560> side<00:02:45.770> would<00:02:46.010> be<00:02:46.130> closer<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.550> kind

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:46.880 
the easier side would be closer to kind

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.990 
the easier side would be closer to kind
of<00:02:47.060> Megaman<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.350> then<00:02:48.860> it'll<00:02:49.280> slowly<00:02:49.640> move

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000 
of Megaman and then it'll slowly move

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.910 
of Megaman and then it'll slowly move
towards<00:02:50.600> or<00:02:50.720> Mega<00:02:50.959> Man<00:02:51.110> goes<00:02:51.320> to<00:02:51.500> our<00:02:51.560> heroes

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
towards or Mega Man goes to our heroes

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.130 
towards or Mega Man goes to our heroes
then<00:02:52.160> we'll<00:02:52.280> slowly<00:02:52.550> move<00:02:52.880> towards<00:02:53.060> more<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.780> a

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
then we'll slowly move towards more of a

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.890 
then we'll slowly move towards more of a
conscious<00:02:55.070> three<00:02:55.570> conscious<00:02:56.570> three<00:02:56.750> down

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
conscious three conscious three down

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.630 
conscious three conscious three down
hard<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.500> then<00:02:57.920> because<00:02:58.160> our<00:02:58.280> game<00:02:58.430> has

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
hard and then because our game has

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.900 
hard and then because our game has
infinite<00:02:59.150> lives<00:03:00.340> we<00:03:01.340> have<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.550> ability<00:03:01.880> to

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:01.910 
infinite lives we have the ability to

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:03.670 
infinite lives we have the ability to
make<00:03:02.090> some<00:03:02.330> of<00:03:02.360> the<00:03:02.480> bosses<00:03:02.660> even<00:03:03.170> harder<00:03:03.500> than

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
make some of the bosses even harder than

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.320 
make some of the bosses even harder than
any<00:03:03.890> of<00:03:04.040> those<00:03:04.130> games<00:03:04.340> possibly<00:03:04.700> could<00:03:05.209> have

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
any of those games possibly could have

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:07.600 
any of those games possibly could have
because<00:03:06.140> you<00:03:06.350> don't<00:03:06.500> have<00:03:06.709> to<00:03:06.830> start<00:03:07.070> fresh

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:07.610 
because you don't have to start fresh

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.510 
because you don't have to start fresh
you<00:03:08.170> should<00:03:09.170> have<00:03:09.320> the<00:03:09.620> ability<00:03:10.040> to<00:03:10.070> grind

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:10.520 
you should have the ability to grind

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.619 
you should have the ability to grind
past<00:03:10.910> it

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:17.059 

how<00:03:15.629> do<00:03:15.689> you<00:03:15.870> play<00:03:16.140> test<00:03:16.439> that<00:03:16.680> when<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.920> make

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:17.069 
how do you play test that when you make

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:20.330 
how do you play test that when you make
it<00:03:17.189> that<00:03:17.370> difficult<00:03:18.439> well<00:03:19.439> in<00:03:19.739> the<00:03:19.890> end<00:03:20.040> will
