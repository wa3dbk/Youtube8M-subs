00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.410
 Hello 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.050
 welcome to the one of my internet we are going to 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.990
 solve the following exercise says well 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:16.960
 how many common divisors do the 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:19.830
 numbers 540 and 360 common dividers here 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.830
 it makes you remember 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.800
 as a true divider 

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:27.800
 greatest common divisor 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.890
 Well, they ask you exactly for the 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.140
 maximum common divisor are fine 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.750
 common dividers I can apply the 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.800
 technique to find common dividers 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.800
 that's what it's about 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:52.550
 we have two 270 182 and 135 90 and so 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.129
 this then is faster than me 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:57.129
 You can take half and no third 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.829
 I know that you can keep pulling 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:02.829
 tertiary 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:09.009
 something more 5a 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:11.310
 that's why it's called common dividers 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:11.310
 true 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.710
 since now there are two and this three 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.520
 cousins ​​with each other then up and 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 finished 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.570
 the decomposition technique 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.570
 to find the mcd 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.570
 here I have common dividers 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:38.880
 if I multiply of course I'm going 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.770
 to have the highest common divisor 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.240
 then the technique of the greatest common 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.570
 divider 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.220
 is to find the maximum the maximum 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.710
 of the multiplication of course of 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.000
 but I do not want to find the maximum what 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:53.350
 I want to find the amount of 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.259
 common dividers 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.310
 then applied the theory for quantity 

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.230
 of dividers 2 plus 1 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:05.430
 here two plus one 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.430
 here was a truth 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:13.640
 11 that's the formula to find the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.640
 number of dividers 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.730
 2 sports 9 for 2 18 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.700
 18 common dividers that is what I 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.860
 they were asking not the maximum the maximum 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.980
 and does that is the multiplication would be 60 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.870
 I think 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.870
 no more 1080 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:43.110
 ready we apply the same strategy but 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:45.570
 conte the number of viewers ready 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.750
 we come back with more than castles up 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.750
 soon
