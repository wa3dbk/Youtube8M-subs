on my Instagram a few days ago it's

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.240 
on my Instagram a few days ago it's
actually<00:00:06.629> super<00:00:07.080> easy<00:00:07.290> even<00:00:07.919> though<00:00:08.010> it<00:00:08.099> looks

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
actually super easy even though it looks

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.459 
actually super easy even though it looks
really<00:00:08.490> unique<00:00:08.880> and<00:00:09.179> different<00:00:10.080> than<00:00:10.349> a<00:00:10.380> lot

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
really unique and different than a lot

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.530 
really unique and different than a lot
of<00:00:10.530> other<00:00:10.769> brains<00:00:11.010> I've<00:00:11.190> seen<00:00:11.490> so<00:00:12.210> as<00:00:12.360> long<00:00:12.480> as

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
of other brains I've seen so as long as

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.379 
of other brains I've seen so as long as
you<00:00:12.750> know<00:00:12.960> how<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.170> do<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.440> French<00:00:13.740> braid<00:00:14.389> it

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
you know how to do a French braid it

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.330 
you know how to do a French braid it
should<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.170> no<00:00:16.320> problem<00:00:16.350> for<00:00:16.830> you<00:00:17.039> to<00:00:17.160> learn

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
should be no problem for you to learn

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.529 
should be no problem for you to learn
and<00:00:17.900> I'd<00:00:18.900> say<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.320> works<00:00:19.529> best<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.480> kind<00:00:21.480> of

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
and I'd say it works best on kind of

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.330 
and I'd say it works best on kind of
like<00:00:21.720> dirty<00:00:22.050> hair<00:00:22.410> so<00:00:22.830> you're<00:00:22.980> not<00:00:23.100> going<00:00:23.279> to

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
like dirty hair so you're not going to

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.160 
like dirty hair so you're not going to
want<00:00:23.430> fresh<00:00:23.699> clean<00:00:23.939> hair<00:00:24.150> and<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.869> definitely

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
want fresh clean hair and it definitely

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.380 
want fresh clean hair and it definitely
works<00:00:25.500> best<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.039> longer<00:00:26.430> hair<00:00:26.640> so<00:00:27.000> I<00:00:27.029> mean

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
works best on the longer hair so I mean

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.439 
works best on the longer hair so I mean
if<00:00:27.510> your<00:00:27.660> hair<00:00:27.930> isn't<00:00:29.000> you<00:00:30.000> know<00:00:30.029> isn't

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
if your hair isn't you know isn't

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.479 
if your hair isn't you know isn't
probably<00:00:30.779> about<00:00:30.900> to<00:00:31.080> hear<00:00:31.380> it's<00:00:31.619> not<00:00:32.160> really

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
probably about to hear it's not really

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.920 
probably about to hear it's not really
going<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.700> be<00:00:32.880> very<00:00:33.000> easy<00:00:33.270> for<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:33.840> it's

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
going to be very easy for you and it's

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.299 
going to be very easy for you and it's
probably<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.469> going<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.680> look<00:00:34.860> right<00:00:34.920> because

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
probably not going to look right because

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.280 
probably not going to look right because
you<00:00:35.460> do<00:00:35.579> kind<00:00:35.850> of<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.180> length<00:00:37.050> to

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you do kind of need that length to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.490 
you do kind of need that length to
really<00:00:37.649> get<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> look<00:00:38.190> um<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.329> are<00:00:39.719> you<00:00:40.200> gonna

just<00:01:33.430> isn't<00:01:34.210> dirty<00:01:34.420> enough<00:01:34.720> to<00:01:34.930> really

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
just isn't dirty enough to really

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.140 
just isn't dirty enough to really
properly<00:01:35.530> do<00:01:35.830> it<00:01:36.010> so<00:01:36.340> sometimes<00:01:36.729> I<00:01:36.940> just<00:01:37.000> like

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:37.150 
properly do it so sometimes I just like

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.390 
properly do it so sometimes I just like
to<00:01:37.330> add<00:01:37.450> some<00:01:37.690> texture<00:01:38.080> because<00:01:39.010> it<00:01:39.190> just

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
to add some texture because it just

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.430 
to add some texture because it just
seems<00:01:39.670> a<00:01:39.820> whole<00:01:40.030> better<00:01:40.300> when<00:01:40.810> there's<00:01:41.140> more

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
seems a whole better when there's more

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.200 
seems a whole better when there's more
texture<00:01:41.920> in<00:01:42.010> it<00:01:42.130> and<00:01:42.340> when<00:01:42.430> it's<00:01:42.580> not<00:01:42.729> just<00:01:43.030> so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
texture in it and when it's not just so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.530

so<00:05:33.169> it's<00:05:33.320> different<00:05:33.530> than<00:05:33.830> a<00:05:33.860> regular<00:05:33.949> French

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:34.520 
so it's different than a regular French

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:37.270 
so it's different than a regular French
braid<00:05:34.610> because<00:05:35.030> you're<00:05:35.990> still<00:05:36.349> adding<00:05:36.830> Heron

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:37.280 
braid because you're still adding Heron

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.010 
braid because you're still adding Heron
at<00:05:37.550> this<00:05:37.789> point<00:05:38.120> where<00:05:38.300> as<00:05:38.389> a<00:05:38.449> regular<00:05:38.780> French

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:39.020 
at this point where as a regular French

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:41.650 
at this point where as a regular French
braid<00:05:39.080> but<00:05:39.410> now<00:05:39.530> just<00:05:39.770> be<00:05:39.979> I<00:05:40.310> don't<00:05:41.240> know<00:05:41.389> what

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:41.660 
braid but now just be I don't know what

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.200 
braid but now just be I don't know what
would<00:05:41.780> you<00:05:41.900> call<00:05:42.110> it<00:05:42.169> just<00:05:42.680> you<00:05:43.520> know<00:05:43.669> that<00:05:43.849> you

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
would you call it just you know that you

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.700 
would you call it just you know that you
you'd<00:05:44.630> be<00:05:44.750> done<00:05:44.900> adding<00:05:45.169> hair<00:05:45.380> and<00:05:45.530> all<00:05:45.620> the

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:45.710 
you'd be done adding hair and all the

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:47.500 
you'd be done adding hair and all the
hair<00:05:45.889> that<00:05:46.010> you'd<00:05:46.159> be<00:05:46.280> working<00:05:46.940> with<00:05:47.240> would

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
hair that you'd be working with would

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:48.969 
hair that you'd be working with would
already<00:05:47.690> be<00:05:47.810> in<00:05:48.020> the<00:05:48.110> parade<00:05:48.380> so<00:05:48.710> you<00:05:48.800> don't

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:48.979 
already be in the parade so you don't

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:51.399 
already be in the parade so you don't
get<00:05:49.099> that<00:05:49.400> I<00:05:49.849> kind<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.300> cascading<00:05:50.930> hair<00:05:51.110> over

00:05:51.399 --> 00:05:51.409 
get that I kind of cascading hair over

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:56.170 
get that I kind of cascading hair over
here<00:05:51.729> so<00:05:53.470> of<00:05:54.470> course<00:05:54.530> you<00:05:54.830> can<00:05:54.979> also<00:05:55.159> as<00:05:55.970> you're

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
here so of course you can also as you're

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.570 
here so of course you can also as you're
doing<00:05:56.300> it<00:05:56.510> take<00:05:56.750> smaller<00:05:57.110> pieces<00:05:57.470> so<00:05:57.979> that

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
doing it take smaller pieces so that

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.510 
doing it take smaller pieces so that
there's<00:05:59.000> less<00:05:59.090> of<00:05:59.630> this<00:06:00.169> area<00:06:00.710> and<00:06:00.979> more<00:06:01.250> of

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
there's less of this area and more of

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.350 
there's less of this area and more of
that<00:06:01.970> going<00:06:02.449> on

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
that going on

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:08.550
