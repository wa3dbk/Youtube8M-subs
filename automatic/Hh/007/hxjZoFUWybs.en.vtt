00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.350 
consistency between all the jungles I'm
testing<00:00:41.210> so<00:00:42.210> yeah<00:00:42.629> let's<00:00:42.840> get<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.140> started

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
testing so yeah let's get this started

00:00:44.360 --> 00:01:02.510 
testing so yeah let's get this started
the<00:00:45.360> end<00:00:45.570> is<00:00:45.750> near<00:00:57.680> drain<00:00:58.680> drain<00:01:00.590> can<00:01:01.590> I<00:01:01.770> feel

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the end is near drain drain can I feel

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:12.940 
the end is near drain drain can I feel
your<00:01:02.550> fear

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:35.570 

to<00:01:13.950> end<00:01:16.040> this<00:01:17.040> way<00:01:31.640> indeed<00:01:33.920> and<00:01:34.920> you<00:01:35.130> go<00:01:35.340> let's

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:35.580 
to end this way indeed and you go let's

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:44.980 
to end this way indeed and you go let's
go<00:01:35.790> kill<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.330> white

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:44.990 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.020

state<00:01:51.390> is<00:01:51.479> actually<00:01:51.690> doing<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.870> little<00:01:51.900> bit

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
state is actually doing a little bit

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.110 
state is actually doing a little bit
slower<00:01:52.620> but<00:01:52.770> he's<00:01:52.890> extremely<00:01:53.370> healthy<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.060> i

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
slower but he's extremely healthy like i

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.160 
slower but he's extremely healthy like i
haven't<00:01:54.390> bought<00:01:54.570> a<00:01:54.600> single<00:01:54.960> pot<00:01:56.270> um<00:01:57.270> so<00:01:57.960> looks

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
haven't bought a single pot um so looks

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.600 
haven't bought a single pot um so looks
like<00:01:58.260> that<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:58.710> case<00:01:58.830> of<00:01:58.890> fiddlesticks

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
like that in the case of fiddlesticks

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.370 
like that in the case of fiddlesticks
you<00:01:59.760> could<00:01:59.909> probably<00:02:00.210> switch<00:02:00.750> up<00:02:00.960> maybe<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
you could probably switch up maybe the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.950 
you could probably switch up maybe the
item<00:02:01.680> you<00:02:01.830> buy<00:02:04.850> at<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> beginning<00:02:06.300> or<00:02:06.540> even<00:02:06.810> go

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
item you buy at the beginning or even go

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.900 
item you buy at the beginning or even go
like<00:02:07.200> significantly<00:02:07.800> less<00:02:08.130> defensive<00:02:08.789> in

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
like significantly less defensive in

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:15.280 
like significantly less defensive in
terms<00:02:09.149> of<00:02:09.240> your<00:02:09.360> masteries<00:02:09.840> very<00:02:10.530> easily<00:02:10.800> I

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.750 

probably<00:02:16.290> do<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.680> I<00:02:16.740> give<00:02:17.250> them<00:02:17.340> much<00:02:17.580> more

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
probably do that I give them much more

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.020 
probably do that I give them much more
offensive<00:02:18.239> masteries<00:02:18.720> instead<00:02:19.050> of<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:20.030> 921

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
offensive masteries instead of going 921

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:34.510 
offensive masteries instead of going 921
like<00:02:21.270> I<00:02:21.390> am<00:02:21.450> now<00:02:23.420> being<00:02:26.900> those<00:02:27.900> guys<00:02:32.959> have<00:02:33.959> it

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
like I am now being those guys have it

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.880 
like I am now being those guys have it
sure<00:02:35.520> what<00:02:35.700> other<00:02:35.850> item<00:02:36.120> he<00:02:36.180> would<00:02:36.330> start

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
sure what other item he would start

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:44.880 
sure what other item he would start
indeed<00:02:37.890> Driggs<00:02:38.519> to<00:02:38.730> anything<00:02:38.940> I<00:02:39.150> guess

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:49.449 

how<00:02:45.890> about<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.100> hit<00:02:46.190> the<00:02:46.280> 4-minute<00:02:46.790> mark<00:02:48.459> the

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
how about to hit the 4-minute mark the

00:02:49.459 --> 00:03:04.090 
how about to hit the 4-minute mark the
end<00:02:49.670> is<00:02:49.880> a<00:02:50.060> single<00:02:50.540> pot<00:03:00.700> you<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:02.740> so<00:03:03.740> roughly

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
end is a single pot you go so roughly

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.370 
end is a single pot you go so roughly
four<00:03:04.490> minutes<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.090> 12<00:03:05.390> seconds<00:03:05.870> it<00:03:06.020> look<00:03:06.140> like

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
four minutes and 12 seconds it look like

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.270 
four minutes and 12 seconds it look like
um<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.900> he's<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.410> safest<00:03:09.980> thing<00:03:10.160> I've

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
um and so he's the safest thing I've

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.760 
um and so he's the safest thing I've
done<00:03:10.459> so<00:03:10.610> far<00:03:10.640> didn't<00:03:10.940> use<00:03:11.060> a<00:03:11.150> single<00:03:11.570> pot<00:03:11.780> yeah

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:12.770 
done so far didn't use a single pot yeah

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:14.290 
done so far didn't use a single pot yeah
