00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.189
 let's start 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.190
 hello my name is Augustin this story 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.080
 it really happened I lived it good I just 

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.790
 I was a spectator in everything that has 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.189
 last and luckily I was not the 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.470
 victim good to the point I will tell my 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.540
 story in 2008 I had a friend 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.340
 called Mauricio and that was about three 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.070
 years bigger than me at that time 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.590
 Mauricio was 15 years old and I only had 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.989
 12 years old he was someone who played a lot 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.210
 the counter strike loved to play it 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.340
 but one day he was surfing the 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.920
 ccoo clan page where they always do 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.750
 propaganda servers then put a go 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.530
 from a server called the server of 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.480
 hell 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.399
 Mauricio was as curious as me and he 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.320
 was and wanted to enter the server I 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.570
 I was looking at him while putting the 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.239
 ipi was loaded but something totally happened 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.369
 unexpected in the middle of the loaded bar 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.740
 above it appeared in a red color and 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.110
 it looked like dripping blood said in 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.390
 blood a very disturbing poetry hello 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.180
 I am the devil and after these words we 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.250
 He told you it is a journey I 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.320
 because of the fright I went to my house because 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.720
 I hate this kind of thing because they end up 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.790
 scary was a new day and there was sun 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.330
 and it was beautiful everything stayed that way until 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.700
 the 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.980
 in the afternoon when Mauricio came to me 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.660
 house even though it was black it was 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:33.270
 white as a zombie and was depressed 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.460
 see him in that state he was pale and cold 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.620
 my mom was surprised to see it like that and 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.690
 he called his house but the line was 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.760
 cut then my mother and I 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.070
 We sit at the table and prepare a 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:45.810
 coffee to mauricio ni grabbed the cup and 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.970
 the shot because it fell out of his hand 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.250
 after this Fabricio put a face 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.290
 angry very forced and then we 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.450
 he began to explain what had happened 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.310
 Maurice had a high- pitched voice that 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.890
 resembled that of a pop singer 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.260
 but this time he was with a faint voice and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.180
 trembling was unbecoming of him with that 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:05.729
 same gloomy voice explained all the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.800
 problem the first thing he said was Augustine 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.670
 you were right we should run 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.709
 of the place 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.110
 The first thing I saw when entering there was what 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.570
 Always choose side and soldier but 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.640
 There was something strange here once I chose 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.800
 the antiterrorist camp does not 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.050
 appeared one of those typical to choose 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.570
 I appeared on that list and as the only 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.640
 option to choose I accepted but I took 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.800
 a huge scare at this time the voice 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.870
 of Mauricio became stronger and hoarse 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.260
 in the list was the name of all my 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.629
 family 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.340
 and my mom my dad and my brothers at 

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.799
 principle I thought it would be mere 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.019
 chance but I was wrong I passed that 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.480
 long and I kept playing back then 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:44.549
 I came across one of the enemies and I 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.319
 he was shaking he was alone with a 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:48.510
 gun he had a rifle 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:50.459
 sniper and I was aiming at 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.620
 the face he knows that because mauricio 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:54.989
 I had one to know where they were pointing 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.150
 and then I decided to kill him with a knife 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.159
 to save bullets I could not help but see 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.530
 that the tears fell to the one who was going 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:03.480
 to kill when I killed him came a scream 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.310
 shuddering did not seem to come from 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.409
 stereo when I saw the name was my 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.959
 older brother diego he lowered in a 

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:12.090
 altiro office we listen to the phone 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.159
 sound ignore that and I heard my mother 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.590
 scream and call me my brother 

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:19.349
 junior king of 11 years we met 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.540
 everyone and apparently was killed had 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:23.609
 stab marks on the body and 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.769
 she was crying in some way she 

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:28.200
 He said not to move from home and that 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.060
 I'll be taking care of Sebastian then 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.920
 I almost cried I went back to the counter 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.530
 strike and what I saw left me speechless 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.480
 where that person had died had 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.550
 found a message in blood saying 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 I killed one and you will be without three 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:44.019
 freed from the chains that bind you 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.090
 I did not understand and I kept playing but then 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:48.340
 two terrorists appeared to me in the 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:50.319
 counter strike as before I did not 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.629
 they fired I heard that the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:54.819
 door and it was my father who came from 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:57.280
 happy work as usual came 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:59.260
 with a smile on his face he greeted us 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.660
 me and my brother and how he was a fan of 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.760
 counter strike and how we sat 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:06.310
 to see how he played then mauricio 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.440
 shot on one of the terrorists what 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.450
 he killed with a shot in the leg but he said 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.400
 that he did not die by the shot a lament 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.590
 very sharp he covered the room and we 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.720
 The three of them entered a huge chill 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.820
 father was more cagón than my brother of 11 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:21.519
 years but he said do not pay attention 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.530
 keep playing then I shot in the 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.720
 head to the terrorist that was left and my 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.910
 father fell from his chair when my brother 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.740
 and I raise my father we noticed that 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.750
 I had a hole in my head 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:33.940
 my brother burst into tears when he noticed 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.949
 this and I vomited I cried of sadness for 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.560
 the death of my father but when I was going to 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:40.360
 call the police something curious happened the 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:42.310
 police called us and we 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.500
 reported that our mother died in her 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.050
 car apparently happened something in the 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.060
 and lost control of the car leaving 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.310
 well of the Mauritian highway was 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.470
 insightful so he realized that 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.660
 so he said that message the only 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.030
 way to finish this was to finish the 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.860
 ties and get out of the dream at least that 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.440
 he thought but when he went to look for 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:04.120
 sebastián the last terrorist results 

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.550
 that in the upper right corner 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.260
 then the suicide icon appeared 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:10.390
 He stopped listening to his crying 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.610
 brother turned shaky and 

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:14.830
 that he saw was horrendous he saw his brother 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:17.020
 beheaded by a scissors in his hands and 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:19.450
 another inserted in the throat but not 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:21.880
 he got bad in fact he was happy and started to 

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:24.100
 laugh out loud as he told me 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:25.990
 I thought that when everyone died in the 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.700
 the counter strike but what he saw what 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:29.950
 He left ice cream saw that where he said 

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.960
 terrorist the list of names was in 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.360
 gray as if they were spectators 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:36.280
 then he sat down and found all the 

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:38.830
 enemy side together and read when 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.390
 they spoke diego said because you killed me 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:43.000
 brother what did I do to get me 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.370
 you did that the character came out of the 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.890
 list my mother said should have you 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:50.530
 forbidden that game now you are a murderer 

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:51.330
 you are no longer my son the father never told me 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:53.970
 I imagined 

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:56.039
 I trembled was ready to read 

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:58.379
 the last sentence but I was surprised to 

00:05:56.039 --> 00:06:00.270
 what happened spoke for the stereo as if 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.580
 I had a microphone and with the same voice 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.069
 of my brother's whistle said we're with 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:07.590
 voice and let's get revenge we will keep you 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:09.960
 in this house and if you go we kill you and 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.210
 then Fabricio closed his eyes and we 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.099
 stopped counting my mother was pale 

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:16.379
 like a leaf and was alarmed to see 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.979
 Mauricio closed his eyes exploded in 

00:06:16.379 --> 00:06:19.289
 tears 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:21.750
 Mauricio looked up and started 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.569
 cry blood and said I will get rid of those 

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.849
 ties I knew Fabricio well and I know 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:28.680
 what I was going to do then I jumped out of the 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.110
 table but like he was three years older 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:33.569
 great that I punched myself in the 

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:36.360
 belly and I fell to the floor and this time I cried and 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:38.699
 I was screaming saying I'm going to finish this 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.009
 play more counter strike and killed yourself 

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.419
 with the kitchen utensils he nailed 

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:44.039
 a fork in one eye and how not 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.629
 I found the knives the very 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.909
 desperate for pain and he was still 

00:06:45.629 --> 00:06:50.250
 nailing the forks and as he saw that 

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:52.259
 he did not die he grabbed a spoon and started 

00:06:50.250 --> 00:06:54.479
 to hit the throat until the 

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:56.849
 my mother was crying scared and I 

00:06:54.479 --> 00:06:58.289
 I could not breathe from that punch 

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:00.809
 a friend die as if not 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:02.610
 and I could not help my father to see this 

00:07:00.809 --> 00:07:04.949
 He called the police but he had arrived 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:07.319
 ten minutes late two years passed 

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:09.449
 after this and now I have 14 to 

00:07:07.319 --> 00:07:13.129
 just like rockerito oeste I assure you 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:13.129
 this story is real
