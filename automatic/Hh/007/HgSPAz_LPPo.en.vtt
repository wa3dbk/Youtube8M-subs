the xbox 360 connected so like I said
well<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:01.950> good<00:02:02.100> for<00:02:02.280> some<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:02.790> purchasing

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
well it's good for some for purchasing

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.569 
well it's good for some for purchasing
and<00:02:03.450> it's<00:02:03.570> good<00:02:03.750> on<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> wallet<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:05.189> just

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
and it's good on the wallet it's just

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.830 
and it's good on the wallet it's just
disappointing<00:02:05.729> because<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.509> like<00:02:06.630> another

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
disappointing because it's like another

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.229 
disappointing because it's like another
thing<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.380> xbox<00:02:07.860> and<00:02:08.099> microsoft<00:02:08.160> have<00:02:08.910> given

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
thing that xbox and microsoft have given

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.330 
thing that xbox and microsoft have given
up<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:09.780> only<00:02:09.929> six<00:02:10.440> months<00:02:10.649> into<00:02:11.250> the

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
up on and only six months into the

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.370 
up on and only six months into the
consoles<00:02:11.760> lifecycle<00:02:12.420> that's<00:02:12.660> crazy

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
consoles lifecycle that's crazy

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.990 
consoles lifecycle that's crazy
I<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> was<00:02:14.070> probably<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.460> desperate<00:02:14.850> move

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
I know it was probably a desperate move

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.090 
I know it was probably a desperate move
to<00:02:15.060> really<00:02:15.930> shake<00:02:16.140> things<00:02:16.170> up<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.710> keep

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
to really shake things up and keep

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.500 
to really shake things up and keep
things<00:02:17.310> alive<00:02:17.460> and<00:02:17.760> keep<00:02:17.880> things<00:02:18.090> fresh<00:02:18.330> and

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
things alive and keep things fresh and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.030 
things alive and keep things fresh and
good<00:02:18.960> it's<00:02:19.230> probably<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.710> to<00:02:19.770> do<00:02:19.890> them

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
good it's probably going to do them

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.400 
good it's probably going to do them

that<00:02:30.390> it<00:02:30.930> seemed<00:02:31.320> like<00:02:31.500> it<00:02:31.620> would<00:02:31.770> have<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> lot

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
that it seemed like it would have a lot

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.010 
that it seemed like it would have a lot
of<00:02:32.250> potential<00:02:32.640> eventually<00:02:33.360> and<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.840> fact

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
of potential eventually and the fact

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.630 
of potential eventually and the fact
that<00:02:34.170> every<00:02:34.590> console<00:02:34.890> was<00:02:35.040> going<00:02:35.250> to<00:02:35.310> have<00:02:35.490> it

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that every console was going to have it

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.060 
that every console was going to have it
I<00:02:35.730> figured<00:02:36.210> eventually<00:02:36.560> some<00:02:37.560> developers

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
I figured eventually some developers

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.300 
I figured eventually some developers
going<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.550> use<00:02:38.760> it<00:02:38.910> besides<00:02:39.450> harmonics<00:02:39.980> but<00:02:40.980> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
going to use it besides harmonics but it

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:43.190 
going to use it besides harmonics but it
just<00:02:41.550> wasn't<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.030> case<00:02:42.180> but<00:02:42.240> that's<00:02:42.720> only<00:02:42.930> six

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
just wasn't the case but that's only six

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.090 
just wasn't the case but that's only six
months<00:02:43.590> in<00:02:43.830> and<00:02:44.340> they<00:02:44.910> ditched<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.300> mm<00:02:46.140> I<00:02:46.350> don't

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100
