other box there we go to very
attractive-looking<00:00:25.099> boxes<00:00:26.099> cool<00:00:26.430> way<00:00:26.849> so

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
attractive-looking boxes cool way so

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:35.959 
attractive-looking boxes cool way so
what<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.789> have<00:00:30.150> its<00:00:31.579> box<00:00:32.579> numero<00:00:33.210> 1<00:00:34.790> look<00:00:35.790> at

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
what we have its box numero 1 look at

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.979 
what we have its box numero 1 look at
that<00:00:36.149> how<00:00:36.480> lovely<00:00:37.050> looking<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> we'll<00:00:39.629> open<00:00:39.780> it

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
that how lovely looking so we'll open it

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.709 
that how lovely looking so we'll open it
up<00:00:41.239> here<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.420> have<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.960> camera<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:44.719> here's

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
up here we have the camera and here's

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.660 
up here we have the camera and here's
just<00:00:45.930> some<00:00:47.030> video<00:00:48.030> cable<00:00:49.219> doesn't<00:00:50.219> even<00:00:50.430> have

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
just some video cable doesn't even have

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.529 
just some video cable doesn't even have
as<00:00:51.149> weird<00:00:51.539> connectors<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:53.149> so<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.180> won't<00:00:54.390> be

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
as weird connectors on it so I won't be

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.470 
as weird connectors on it so I won't be
using<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.899> one<00:00:55.820> and<00:00:56.820> then<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.149> off<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
using that one and then here off the

this one for a battery connection plugs
in<00:02:24.440> that<00:02:25.440> way<00:02:25.620> around<00:02:26.360> and<00:02:27.360> we've<00:02:27.540> got<00:02:27.720> this

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
in that way around and we've got this

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.060 
in that way around and we've got this
one<00:02:28.730> which<00:02:29.730> has<00:02:31.460> white<00:02:32.460> and<00:02:33.200> green<00:02:34.200> are<00:02:34.560> audio

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
one which has white and green are audio

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.940 
one which has white and green are audio
yellow<00:02:35.550> his<00:02:35.730> video<00:02:36.200> black<00:02:37.200> his<00:02:37.410> ground<00:02:38.180> red<00:02:39.180> is

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
yellow his video black his ground red is

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.940 
yellow his video black his ground red is
positive<00:02:42.260> unfortunately<00:02:43.260> enough<00:02:43.530> they<00:02:43.800> match

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
positive unfortunately enough they match

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
the same colors for the actual camera so

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.330 
the same colors for the actual camera so
it'll<00:02:46.350> be<00:02:46.380> easy<00:02:47.690> doing<00:02:48.690> them<00:02:48.950> here<00:02:49.950> it<00:02:50.070> is<00:02:50.130> it's

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
it'll be easy doing them here it is it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.390 
it'll be easy doing them here it is it's
a<00:02:50.490> 200<00:02:50.910> milliwatt<00:02:51.590> 5.8<00:02:52.590> you<00:02:52.740> get<00:02:52.920> hurt<00:02:53.040> one<00:02:53.190> it

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
a 200 milliwatt 5.8 you get hurt one it

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.250 
a 200 milliwatt 5.8 you get hurt one it
looks<00:02:53.580> from<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.300> front<00:02:54.420> like<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.870> two<00:02:55.020> point

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
looks from the front like the two point

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.550 
looks from the front like the two point
four<00:02:56.000> and<00:02:57.000> five<00:02:57.540> hundred<00:02:57.840> milliwatts<00:02:58.170> but

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
four and five hundred milliwatts but

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.580 
four and five hundred milliwatts but
it's<00:02:58.709> not<00:02:58.890> and<00:02:59.850> it's<00:02:59.970> good<00:03:00.330> in<00:03:00.450> heat<00:03:00.720> heat

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
it's not and it's good in heat heat

it's not and it's good in heat heat
shrink<00:03:02.040> wrap<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:03.470> think<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.650> remove<00:03:04.950> that<00:03:05.240> not

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
shrink wrap I think you remove that not

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.240 
shrink wrap I think you remove that not
one<00:03:06.330> hundred<00:03:06.390> percent<00:03:06.600> shoulder<00:03:07.170> I'm<00:03:08.100> going

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
one hundred percent shoulder I'm going

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.110 
one hundred percent shoulder I'm going
to<00:03:08.370> form<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.120> later<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:10.650> it's<00:03:11.100> got<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.430> 2d

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
to form that one later and it's got a 2d

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:18.580
