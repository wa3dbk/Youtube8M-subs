00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
old coins but I'll I knew there was a

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.310 
old coins but I'll I knew there was a
lot<00:00:27.090> of<00:00:27.119> cloud<00:00:27.390> there<00:00:27.630> so<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> figured<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.199> know

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
lot of cloud there so I figured you know

lot of cloud there so I figured you know
I'd<00:00:28.500> look<00:00:28.769> at<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:28.949> old<00:00:29.099> stuff<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.490> between<00:00:29.640> and

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
I'd look at the old stuff in between and

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
I'd look at the old stuff in between and
take<00:00:30.269> a<00:00:30.300> lot<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.539> cloud<00:00:30.810> but<00:00:31.679> um<00:00:31.830> you<00:00:32.099> can<00:00:32.340> tell

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
take a lot of cloud but um you can tell

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.479 
take a lot of cloud but um you can tell
I<00:00:32.550> focused<00:00:33.000> on<00:00:33.090> quarters<00:00:33.540> it's<00:00:33.750> probably

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
I focused on quarters it's probably

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.740

maybe<00:00:35.489> four<00:00:35.730> dollars<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.180> still<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.480> cloud

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750

on<00:03:26.280> a<00:03:26.310> silver<00:03:26.760> ring<00:03:26.820> like<00:03:27.030> this<00:03:27.209> with<00:03:27.600> that

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
on a silver ring like this with that

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:31.430 
on a silver ring like this with that
many<00:03:28.019> and<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:28.200> big<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.680> be<00:03:28.830> real<00:03:29.070> and<00:03:30.440> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
many and that big to be real and you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.140 
many and that big to be real and you
know<00:03:31.470> a<00:03:31.590> few<00:03:31.920> that<00:03:32.070> I<00:03:32.100> thought<00:03:32.519> might<00:03:33.000> have

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
know a few that I thought might have

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.880 
know a few that I thought might have
been<00:03:33.300> you<00:03:33.840> know<00:03:33.959> turned<00:03:34.170> out<00:03:34.320> to<00:03:34.470> be<00:03:34.560> not<00:03:34.739> too

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
been you know turned out to be not too

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.850 
been you know turned out to be not too
great<00:03:35.160> but<00:03:35.880> the<00:03:36.239> good<00:03:36.420> news<00:03:36.600> is<00:03:36.810> I<00:03:37.080> did<00:03:37.410> find<00:03:37.709> my

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
great but the good news is I did find my

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.160 
great but the good news is I did find my
first<00:03:38.100> diamond<00:03:38.760> ring<00:03:39.090> and<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.360> did<00:03:39.750> think<00:03:40.019> this

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
first diamond ring and I did think this

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.810 
first diamond ring and I did think this
one<00:03:40.410> was<00:03:40.590> going<00:03:40.769> to<00:03:40.830> be<00:03:40.950> real<00:03:41.160> when<00:03:41.280> I<00:03:41.370> found<00:03:41.640> it

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
one was going to be real when I found it

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:45.650 
one was going to be real when I found it
just<00:03:42.030> because<00:03:42.959> of<00:03:42.989> how<00:03:43.290> how<00:03:44.250> tiny<00:03:44.670> it<00:03:44.970> is<00:03:45.090> you

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
just because of how how tiny it is you

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.000 
just because of how how tiny it is you
can<00:03:45.780> see<00:03:45.959> it<00:03:46.050> catching<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.590> light<00:03:46.739> there<00:03:46.980> a

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
can see it catching the light there a

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.250 
can see it catching the light there a
little<00:03:47.190> bit<00:03:47.430> I<00:03:47.700> mean<00:03:48.030> this<00:03:48.209> thing<00:03:48.510> is<00:03:48.540> just

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
little bit I mean this thing is just

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.600 
little bit I mean this thing is just
about<00:03:49.530> as<00:03:49.709> small<00:03:50.010> as<00:03:50.130> it<00:03:50.280> gets

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
about as small as it gets

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:52.699 
about as small as it gets
and<00:03:50.910> I<00:03:51.000> couldn't<00:03:51.300> see<00:03:51.510> somebody<00:03:51.840> putting<00:03:52.650> a

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
and I couldn't see somebody putting a

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.680 
and I couldn't see somebody putting a
fake<00:03:53.060> stone<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.709> miniscule<00:03:55.709> you<00:03:56.010> know<00:03:56.160> in<00:03:56.690> in

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
fake stone that miniscule you know in in

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:02.270 
fake stone that miniscule you know in in
a<00:03:57.780> ring<00:03:57.989> like<00:03:58.170> this<00:03:58.700> but<00:03:59.700> I<00:03:59.730> have<00:04:00.830> my<00:04:01.830> settings

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
a ring like this but I have my settings

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.210 
a ring like this but I have my settings
set<00:04:02.610> to<00:04:02.640> the<00:04:02.940> proper<00:04:03.300> setting<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:04.590> the<00:04:04.709> size<00:04:05.010> of

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
set to the proper setting to the size of

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.720 
set to the proper setting to the size of
it<00:04:05.400> and<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.300> temperature<00:04:06.840> so<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:08.519> give<00:04:08.700> you

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:08.730 
it and to the temperature so to give you

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:11.870 
it and to the temperature so to give you
an<00:04:08.880> example<00:04:09.209> first<00:04:10.100> let<00:04:11.100> me<00:04:11.220> see<00:04:11.430> it<00:04:11.550> have<00:04:11.730> to

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:11.880 
an example first let me see it have to

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:16.009 
an example first let me see it have to
adjust<00:04:12.330> this<00:04:12.600> a<00:04:13.700> little<00:04:14.700> bit<00:04:15.269> this<00:04:15.660> would<00:04:15.870> have

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
adjust this a little bit this would have

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:17.440 
adjust this a little bit this would have
to<00:04:16.170> come<00:04:16.320> down<00:04:16.350> a<00:04:16.530> little<00:04:16.680> bit

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
to come down a little bit

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.270 
to come down a little bit
here<00:04:17.630> I'll<00:04:17.930> see<00:04:18.320> if<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:18.500> can<00:04:18.650> get<00:04:18.800> this<00:04:18.950> that's

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
here I'll see if I can get this that's

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.180 
here I'll see if I can get this that's
about<00:04:19.400> right<00:04:19.790> there<00:04:20.030> and<00:04:20.810> I'll<00:04:21.020> put<00:04:21.800> it<00:04:21.890> on<00:04:22.010> the

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
about right there and I'll put it on the

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.700 
about right there and I'll put it on the
test<00:04:22.580> for<00:04:22.850> here<00:04:23.030> just<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.450> show<00:04:23.510> you<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:24.200> get<00:04:24.680> a

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:24.710 
test for here just to show you I get a

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:28.540 
test for here just to show you I get a
fake<00:04:24.980> reading<00:04:25.340> on<00:04:25.460> this<00:04:26.470> it's<00:04:27.470> clearly<00:04:28.130> on<00:04:28.400> the

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
fake reading on this it's clearly on the

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.600 
fake reading on this it's clearly on the
stone<00:04:28.820> doesn't<00:04:29.120> really<00:04:29.330> go<00:04:29.510> anywhere

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
stone doesn't really go anywhere

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:33.250 
stone doesn't really go anywhere
indicating<00:04:31.610> it<00:04:31.730> that's<00:04:31.970> fake<00:04:32.300> and<00:04:32.900> I<00:04:33.020> messed

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
indicating it that's fake and I messed

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:34.660 
indicating it that's fake and I messed
around<00:04:33.410> with<00:04:33.650> this<00:04:33.830> a<00:04:33.890> lot<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.340> make<00:04:34.490> sure<00:04:34.640> I

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
around with this a lot to make sure I

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.000 
around with this a lot to make sure I
was<00:04:34.940> doing<00:04:34.970> it<00:04:35.420> right<00:04:35.630> you<00:04:36.590> know<00:04:36.650> to<00:04:36.770> kind<00:04:36.890> of

this little one I gotta do it real
carefully<00:04:51.500> make<00:04:51.680> sure<00:04:51.710> it's<00:04:51.980> not<00:04:52.100> on<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.370> ring

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
carefully make sure it's not on the ring

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.840

hold this out of here a little bit and
you<00:04:57.980> can<00:04:58.010> see<00:04:58.190> if<00:04:58.520> once<00:04:59.030> it<00:04:59.150> goes<00:04:59.300> up<00:04:59.510> into<00:05:00.170> this

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
you can see if once it goes up into this

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.920 
you can see if once it goes up into this
area<00:05:00.740> here<00:05:00.910> into<00:05:01.910> the<00:05:02.030> red<00:05:02.210> and<00:05:02.450> I<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.570> starts

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
area here into the red and I it starts

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.170 
area here into the red and I it starts
beeping<00:05:03.380> and<00:05:03.560> it's<00:05:03.980> it's<00:05:04.310> it's<00:05:04.610> an<00:05:04.760> indication

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:05.180 
beeping and it's it's it's an indication

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:14.590 
beeping and it's it's it's an indication
it's<00:05:05.540> a<00:05:05.690> diamond<00:05:12.910> and<00:05:13.910> no<00:05:14.060> matter<00:05:14.240> how<00:05:14.450> many

it's a diamond and no matter how many

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.440 
it's a diamond and no matter how many
times<00:05:14.870> I<00:05:15.050> test<00:05:15.290> this<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:15.970> no<00:05:16.970> matter<00:05:17.180> how<00:05:17.300> I've

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
times I test this one no matter how I've

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.870 
times I test this one no matter how I've
had<00:05:17.660> the<00:05:17.780> settings<00:05:18.110> it's<00:05:18.260> come<00:05:18.500> up<00:05:18.650> real<00:05:18.980> so<00:05:19.850> uh
