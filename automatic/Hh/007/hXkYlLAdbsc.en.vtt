00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200 
now we are going to make cloverleaf nut

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.950 
now we are going to make cloverleaf nut
clover<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.259> lib<00:00:07.470> nut<00:00:07.770> means<00:00:08.330> the<00:00:09.330> knob<00:00:09.570> looks

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
clover the lib nut means the knob looks

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.079 
clover the lib nut means the knob looks
like<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:11.059> three<00:00:12.059> years<00:00:12.440> over<00:00:13.440> there<00:00:13.679> one<00:00:14.639> two

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
like this three years over there one two

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.620 
like this three years over there one two
three<00:00:15.360> years<00:00:15.780> like<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.230> cloverleaf<00:00:16.940> okay<00:00:17.940> but

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
three years like a cloverleaf okay but

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.109 
three years like a cloverleaf okay but
that<00:00:18.900> what<00:00:19.080> you<00:00:19.230> have<00:00:19.380> to<00:00:19.560> do<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.850> put<00:00:21.090> it

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
that what you have to do but to put it

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.910 
that what you have to do but to put it
up<00:00:21.510> like<00:00:21.750> that<00:00:21.990> and<00:00:22.289> put<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> pin<00:00:23.670> on<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.029> top

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:24.920 
up like that and put a pin on the top

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.519 
up like that and put a pin on the top
this<00:00:25.920> is<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.369> pastor<00:00:26.970> look<00:00:27.320> okay<00:00:28.369> then<00:00:30.260> dip<00:00:31.260> in

near to this place on the head okay now
took<00:00:57.510> your<00:00:57.750> pin<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:59.960> then<00:01:00.960> dip<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:02.039> here<00:01:02.370> too

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:03.379 
took your pin here then dip in here too

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.580 
took your pin here then dip in here too
then<00:01:04.379> take<00:01:05.010> this<00:01:05.309> one<00:01:05.610> go<00:01:06.540> around<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.380> this

then take this one go around with this

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:15.080 
then take this one go around with this
pin<00:01:07.920> like<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:09.380> then<00:01:10.700> go<00:01:11.700> inside<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.990> look<00:01:14.090> so

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
pin like this then go inside the look so

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.690 
pin like this then go inside the look so
you<00:01:15.150> can<00:01:15.540> bend<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.380> go<00:01:16.740> inside<00:01:17.310> the<00:01:17.520> loop

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you can bend it and go inside the loop

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.050 
you can bend it and go inside the loop
like<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.680> see<00:01:20.060> let<00:01:21.060> this<00:01:21.390> month<00:01:21.780> you<00:01:22.500> got<00:01:22.740> it

like that see let this month you got it

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:30.100 
like that see let this month you got it
now<00:01:24.350> put<00:01:25.350> your<00:01:25.560> pin<00:01:25.830> again<00:01:27.350> then<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.740> last<00:01:28.950> one

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
now put your pin again then the last one

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:35.270 
now put your pin again then the last one
see<00:01:31.110> last<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:32.540> last<00:01:33.540> one<00:01:33.930> come<00:01:34.500> round<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.159> see

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
see last one last one come round and see

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:42.399 
see last one last one come round and see
one<00:01:35.820> two<00:01:36.420> three<00:01:36.990> let's<00:01:37.799> go<00:01:38.100> under<00:01:38.579> these<00:01:38.939> three

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:49.880 

see<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.710> comes<00:01:44.640> out<00:01:46.159> 12<00:01:47.159> count<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:48.470> then<00:01:49.470> comes

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
see and comes out 12 count it then comes

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.590 
see and comes out 12 count it then comes
up

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
up

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.719 
up
now<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.290> cannot<00:01:52.860> just<00:01:53.130> let<00:01:53.369> a<00:01:53.430> bit<00:01:53.790> like<00:01:54.509> that

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:55.729 
now you cannot just let a bit like that

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.710 
now you cannot just let a bit like that
put<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.909> outer<00:01:57.119> bit<00:01:57.830> pin<00:01:58.830> it<00:01:58.979> together<00:01:59.720> then

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
put the outer bit pin it together then

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.850 
put the outer bit pin it together then
can<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.770> squared<00:02:02.070> like<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:06.860> slowly

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
can get this squared like that slowly

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.249 
can get this squared like that slowly
and<00:02:08.130> just<00:02:08.489> keep<00:02:08.759> on<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.300> board<00:02:09.600> itself<00:02:09.780> then

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
and just keep on the board itself then

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.370 
and just keep on the board itself then
it<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.590> be<00:02:10.739> easy<00:02:10.979> for<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.370> to<00:02:11.760> come<00:02:12.000> on<00:02:12.380> then

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it will be easy for you to come on then

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.790 
it will be easy for you to come on then
you<00:02:13.590> can<00:02:13.830> be<00:02:14.040> like<00:02:14.069> this<00:02:14.730> one<00:02:15.000> see<00:02:15.420> you<00:02:16.410> can<00:02:16.590> get

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
you can be like this one see you can get

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.280 
you can be like this one see you can get
three<00:02:17.069> looks<00:02:17.430> right<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:19.470> is<00:02:19.709> called

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:21.290 
three looks right this is called

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.979 
three looks right this is called
cloverleaf<00:02:22.290> not<00:02:23.150> and<00:02:24.150> send<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:26.209> so<00:02:27.209> easy<00:02:27.600> to

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
cloverleaf not and send it so easy to

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:35.800 
cloverleaf not and send it so easy to
make<00:02:28.019> it<00:02:28.350> right<00:02:29.239> see<00:02:32.360> remove<00:02:33.360> all<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.690> pins

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
make it right see remove all the pins

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.720 
make it right see remove all the pins
see<00:02:36.810> and<00:02:37.110> tighten<00:02:37.800> is<00:02:37.950> like

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730
