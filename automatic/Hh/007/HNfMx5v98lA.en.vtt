 that 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:12.709
 if people want to repeat using creativity 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:19.669
 baptized in course something alien to this personal interest 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.489
 of careers 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:23.960
 any crisis can overcome 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.349
 she said that 

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.349
 3rd of the law n 

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.269
 he understands what is happening and from this point of view the huge increase 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.120
 the advertising 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.750
 Can you pass on to society? 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.340
 what's happening 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.059
 I think the differential 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.430
 much of what is happening in the world 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.130
 this Tuesday in Brazil 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.860
 the treatment of the product a final part 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.040
 autonomous 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.040
 of the financial system it is built 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.880
 her sister 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.960
 and appropriated 1 April new products 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 that was likely 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.730
 the actress 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:08.620
 indignant it is our duty to pant 

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.420
 but it depends on a more important race 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.540
 keita 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.910
 level of employment 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.240
 from the point of view of businessmen 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.190
 he left the station still looking for new technologies 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.610
 and so that there is no internet access 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.760
 Do you believe that the demand 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.950
 then the investments 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.720
 the two titles 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.200
 depends on objective goals 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.300
 but it depended heavily on things that are here 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.530
 of this amount at rates by communication 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:39.740
 between the facts 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.130
 forward of the entire line 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.580
 the consumer 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.190
 3rd their interest 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.730
 who wants to get incredible and keeps a real showcase 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.960
 the entrepreneur 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.690
 because if you are not sure you will gain anything 

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:56.940
 by miami 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.440
 he will wait 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.940
 is the government preferred the news you can take the body up to the bridge 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.610
 the problem is that they do not know how I fought with the bbc 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.280
 in the United States 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.709
 in Japan 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.219
 in Europe 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.129
 it's a crisis 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:14.429
 the financial system 

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.429
 that was revealed 

00:02:17.429 --> 00:02:19.449
 in an intervention on this 

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:21.009
 in October many set 

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:22.349
 about the possibility 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:24.079
 hence the businessmen 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.519
 joking and from the capital to the banks 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.519
 in my opinion will end the solution 

00:02:30.929 --> 00:02:33.649
 the social services of america 

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:35.999
 if he talks to the boss 

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:38.469
 on a Tuesday 9 later 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.209
 and play 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:41.819
 the system 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.129
 clinical practice 

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.289
 he ran around noon 

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:49.969
 in any case to obtain a peace 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.659
 the old ones 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:53.879
 investors will lose everything 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.279
 and the organizers will pay nothing in our otherwise 

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.719
 the crisis 

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.249
 cafu 

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:01.609
 in the past when the sea 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.389
 the so-called project that demand grew 4% of GDP and banking inclusion and 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.619
 from there 

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:11.099
 my criticisms of monetary policy are always very 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.619
 during the tournament 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.329
 in fact it was terrible 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.419
 but from the fiscal point of view 

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:20.179
 the Brazilian central bank never again 

00:03:20.179 --> 00:03:21.509
 turned a river 

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:22.999
 made use of the arms 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:26.049
 - it's a day after scoring the first goal 

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:28.769
 in a few months 

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.769
 because it has because customers individuals 

00:03:33.559 --> 00:03:35.849
 in Portugal 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.170
 mild temperatures 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.929
 what starts with the agenda 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:41.290
 apparently the quality of the player 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.290
 for 25 years away from pacaembu 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.449
 just the stretch 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:50.269
 badly grew back more than the world 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.029
 we had better go 

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:55.479
 even though the activity level will be much better they will not book 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:59.079
 these financial innovations 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:00.319
 the pilot 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.829
 which were produced by a dream 

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:06.019
 since the economists had discovered and three minimums 

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:08.539
 stuck at any time 

00:04:08.539 --> 00:04:11.539
 helped to expand 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.779
 this expansion of credit 

00:04:13.779 --> 00:04:16.409
 was responsible for insuring 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:21.039
 a great expansion of the world loses in the last five years but another factor 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:22.229
 preponderant 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.680
 trade of the united states 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.159
 accumulated 

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:28.949
 from 2002 to 2008 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:30.279
 are 24 

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:32.289
 million dollars 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.770
 this fury and turns 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.050
 kate winslet around the world running 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.300
 the smartest bank to be 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.990
 mendonÃ§a 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:45.530
 in the great abc coach vineyard 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.039
 something 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:48.639
 that the lender does not know 

00:04:48.639 --> 00:04:50.930
 when it happens 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.699
 a goal in which it is increasingly difficult to assess the quality 

00:04:56.189 --> 00:04:57.069
 that he spoke 

00:04:57.069 --> 00:04:59.719
 there is a reduction of the personal credit of the south 

00:04:59.719 --> 00:05:01.520
 when are we all? 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.659
 appears another phenomenon all adverse selection 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:08.829
 who presents himself with the loan with higher interest in general 

00:05:08.829 --> 00:05:10.159
 and it will not erase 

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:14.740
 suggested to me that they will continue you going to a definitive system collapse 

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.150
 in the rural sector 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:19.159
 when he saw that it was happening all 

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:23.259
 risk-free system in which the liquidity of the system is located for the 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:24.990
 balance 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.650
 what is hc estimates 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.680
 the band slows down a bit 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.419
 but loses its name 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.349
 we suspend less 

00:05:33.349 --> 00:05:34.860
 everybody looks for 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.479
 good part of the resources 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.490
 and how do you have 

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:39.960
 the global demand for the circuit 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:41.650
 everybody's head 

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.059
 and will live with mother cast 

00:05:44.059 --> 00:05:46.379
 the block 

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:49.379
 there is no politics because the politics of many movements 

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:53.280
 I saw the most important thing we do pt 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.310
 punishing mine is not so important for the right of other leaders to want 

00:05:59.389 --> 00:06:03.919
 I define 1 million entrepreneurs and workers can raise the price 

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:05.599
 increase in salary 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:07.360
 and it was inflation that 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.759
 now with the preventive 

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:11.349
 after the robbery 

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:15.719
 after opting for me I go to all who have no risk of staying 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:16.930
 unemployed in Brazil 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.389
 I want Brazil does not have to worry
