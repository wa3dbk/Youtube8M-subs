the RB 5 this is as I say the third

over<00:01:04.430> the<00:01:04.580> winter<00:01:05.000> so<00:01:05.830> exactly<00:01:06.830> how<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.009> car

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
over the winter so exactly how the car

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.830 
over the winter so exactly how the car
suits<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.759> tires<00:01:08.000> and<00:01:08.210> what<00:01:08.390> we'll<00:01:08.539> have<00:01:08.570> to

suits the tires and what we'll have to

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.010 
suits the tires and what we'll have to

we're<00:01:26.960> using<00:01:27.140> the<00:01:27.350> Rhino<00:01:27.590> system<00:01:28.040> it's

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.219 
we're using the Rhino system it's
probably<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.420> little<00:01:29.479> bit<00:01:29.659> on<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:29.960> heavy<00:01:30.200> side

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
probably a little bit on the heavy side

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.010 
probably a little bit on the heavy side
but<00:01:30.950> it's<00:01:31.100> something<00:01:31.640> that<00:01:31.820> was<00:01:32.119> developed

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:33.020 
but it's something that was developed

two<00:01:33.170> years<00:01:33.409> ago<00:01:33.680> we<00:01:34.490> tested<00:01:35.060> very<00:01:35.270> briefly

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:35.689 
two years ago we tested very briefly

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
with it start of 2009 but elected not to

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:41.409 
race it through 2009 so in that sense

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.200 
race it through 2009 so in that sense
possibly<00:01:42.409> Ferrari<00:01:43.189> and<00:01:43.369> McLaren<00:01:43.430> who<00:01:43.850> did<00:01:44.030> use

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
it through the whole year I've certainly

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:47.649 
it through the whole year I've certainly
have<00:01:46.400> more<00:01:46.610> experience<00:01:47.060> with<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:47.360> system

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.649 
have more experience with the system
than<00:01:47.840> we<00:01:47.990> do<00:01:48.610> we've<00:01:49.610> tried<00:01:49.790> to<00:01:49.820> package<00:01:50.210> it<00:01:50.390> in

than we do we've tried to package it in

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.560 
than we do we've tried to package it in
a<00:01:50.840> way<00:01:50.869> that<00:01:51.290> minimizes<00:01:52.000> the<00:01:53.000> aerodynamic

those for the designers main regulation
change<00:02:08.030> really<00:02:08.390> has<00:02:08.540> been<00:02:08.750> the<00:02:08.899> double

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
change really has been the double

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.039 
change really has been the double
banning<00:02:09.709> of<00:02:09.799> the<00:02:09.829> double<00:02:10.160> diffuser<00:02:11.049> that's

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.049 
banning of the double diffuser that's

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.290 
banning of the double diffuser that's
quite<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.320> big<00:02:12.590> downforce<00:02:13.220> reduction<00:02:13.730> it<00:02:13.879> takes

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
quite a big downforce reduction it takes

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.620 
quite a big downforce reduction it takes
us<00:02:14.480> back<00:02:15.230> to<00:02:15.260> a<00:02:15.410> start<00:02:16.250> of<00:02:16.370> 2009

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
us back to a start of 2009

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.680 
us back to a start of 2009
so<00:02:17.990> we<00:02:18.110> have<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.670> try<00:02:19.670> and<00:02:19.700> develop<00:02:20.030> as<00:02:20.390> much<00:02:20.450> as

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
so we have to try and develop as much as

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.960 
so we have to try and develop as much as
we<00:02:20.810> can<00:02:20.960> to<00:02:21.020> recover<00:02:21.470> that<00:02:21.530> lost<00:02:21.710> downforce<00:02:22.400> if

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
we can to recover that lost downforce if

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.580 
we can to recover that lost downforce if
we're<00:02:23.120> still<00:02:23.360> behind<00:02:23.900> where<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.290> finished

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
we're still behind where we finished

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.860 
we're still behind where we finished
last<00:02:24.770> year

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
last year

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.000 
last year
we'll<00:02:26.870> just<00:02:27.050> keep<00:02:27.230> chipping<00:02:27.440> away<00:02:27.650> that's<00:02:27.890> it

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.010 
we'll just keep chipping away that's it

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:36.080 
we'll just keep chipping away that's it
really

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.150
