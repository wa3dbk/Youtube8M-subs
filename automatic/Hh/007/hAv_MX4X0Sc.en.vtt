00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
as well because it's so powerful it's

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.399 
as well because it's so powerful it's
basically<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.220> way<00:01:29.670> better<00:01:30.030> version<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:30.869> the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
basically a way better version of the

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.340 
basically a way better version of the
ae4<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:32.640> can<00:01:32.820> also<00:01:33.060> toggle<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.750> shotgun

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
ae4 and you can also toggle the shotgun

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.020 
ae4 and you can also toggle the shotgun
mode<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.829> really<00:01:35.340> packs<00:01:35.790> a<00:01:36.000> punch

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
mode which really packs a punch

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.450 
mode which really packs a punch
especially<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:37.079> you're<00:01:37.320> close<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.250> does<00:01:38.430> a

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
especially if you're close and it does a

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.130 
especially if you're close and it does a
lot<00:01:38.729> of<00:01:38.790> damage<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.479> when<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.659> upgrade<00:01:40.110> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
lot of damage and when you upgrade it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.630 
lot of damage and when you upgrade it
this<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.799> probably<00:01:41.130> one<00:01:41.280> of<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.400> best

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
this is probably one of the best

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
think that's a really good addition

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.280 
think that's a really good addition
towards<00:02:01.680> it<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.159> honestly<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.850> hope<00:02:03.270> DLC<00:02:03.990> for

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
towards it and I honestly I hope DLC for

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.920 
towards it and I honestly I hope DLC for
adds<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:05.040> sort<00:02:05.369> of<00:02:05.460> directed-energy<00:02:06.210> weapon

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
adds some sort of directed-energy weapon

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.109 
adds some sort of directed-energy weapon
like<00:02:07.229> this<00:02:07.530> so<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:08.039> they<00:02:08.220> continue<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.819> add

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
like this so that they continue to add

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.880 
like this so that they continue to add
the<00:02:09.390> sort<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.750> flare<00:02:10.110> towards<00:02:10.619> advanced

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
the sort of flare towards advanced

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.380 
the sort of flare towards advanced

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.940 
remind me of is am buried when you get
the<00:02:30.329> Remington<00:02:30.900> New<00:02:31.079> Model<00:02:31.109> Army<00:02:31.439> you<00:02:31.890> know

the Remington New Model Army you know

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.220 
the Remington New Model Army you know
how<00:02:32.189> you<00:02:32.250> flip<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:32.790> and<00:02:33.090> so<00:02:33.299> basically<00:02:33.840> get

that get it akimbo and you're pretty
much<00:02:36.810> set<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.500> honestly<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.950> believe<00:02:38.040> they're

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
much set and honestly I believe they're

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.610 
much set and honestly I believe they're
around<00:02:38.939> the<00:02:39.150> straight<00:02:39.450> same<00:02:39.810> strength<00:02:40.290> maybe

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
around the straight same strength maybe

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.250 
around the straight same strength maybe
the<00:02:40.829> m1<00:02:41.099> irons<00:02:41.459> are<00:02:41.609> a<00:02:41.640> bit<00:02:42.120> stronger<00:02:42.599> and<00:02:42.989> if

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
the m1 irons are a bit stronger and if

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.129 
the m1 irons are a bit stronger and if
you<00:02:43.319> actually<00:02:43.560> double<00:02:44.400> tap<00:02:44.609> Y<00:02:45.000> on<00:02:45.480> the<00:02:45.750> weapon

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:46.139 
you actually double tap Y on the weapon

00:02:46.139 --> 00:02:48.140 
you actually double tap Y on the weapon
when<00:02:46.349> you<00:02:46.470> just<00:02:46.769> walk<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> weapons<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.849> makes

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
when you just walk the weapons it makes

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.180 
when you just walk the weapons it makes
this<00:02:48.299> really<00:02:48.599> cool<00:02:48.780> animation<00:02:49.709> of<00:02:49.889> you<00:02:50.010> like

one of the best weapons on exo-zombies
in<00:02:57.359> terms<00:02:57.659> of<00:02:57.870> aesthetics<00:02:58.560> like<00:02:58.769> man<00:02:59.069> does<00:02:59.340> it

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
look especially great with that second

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.470 
look especially great with that second
camel<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.040> it's<00:03:02.189> just<00:03:02.370> so<00:03:02.549> much<00:03:02.700> fun<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:03.209> use

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
camel and it's just so much fun to use

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.509 
camel and it's just so much fun to use
and<00:03:03.689> you<00:03:04.109> don't<00:03:04.139> really<00:03:04.530> run<00:03:04.829> out<00:03:04.859> of<00:03:04.980> ammo<00:03:05.459> too

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
and you don't really run out of ammo too

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.550 
and you don't really run out of ammo too
fast<00:03:05.970> and<00:03:06.269> when<00:03:06.359> you<00:03:06.450> do<00:03:06.629> you<00:03:06.840> usually<00:03:07.139> have

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:07.560 
fast and when you do you usually have

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.589 
fast and when you do you usually have
enough<00:03:07.859> points<00:03:08.189> to<00:03:08.700> upgrade<00:03:08.849> it<00:03:09.239> up<00:03:09.329> to<00:03:09.510> the

00:03:09.589 --> 00:03:09.599 
enough points to upgrade it up to the

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.509 
enough points to upgrade it up to the
next<00:03:09.810> mark<00:03:10.170> upgrade<00:03:10.680> and<00:03:10.889> I<00:03:10.950> think<00:03:11.220> it's<00:03:11.370> just

00:03:11.509 --> 00:03:11.519 
next mark upgrade and I think it's just

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:13.580 
next mark upgrade and I think it's just
a<00:03:11.670> lot<00:03:12.030> of<00:03:12.060> fun<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.510> use<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.870> definitely<00:03:13.530> a

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
great for points but it definitely packs

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.119

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
always going to be there you can bet

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.199 
always going to be there you can bet
your<00:03:44.129> ass<00:03:44.159> you're<00:03:44.459> gonna<00:03:44.579> see<00:03:44.849> the<00:03:44.970> cel-3

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
your ass you're gonna see the cel-3

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.020 
your ass you're gonna see the cel-3
cauterizer<00:03:45.389> in<00:03:46.109> DLC<00:03:46.530> four<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.010> I'd<00:03:47.430> even<00:03:47.609> say

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
cauterizer in DLC four and I'd even say

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.990 
cauterizer in DLC four and I'd even say
most<00:03:48.389> likely<00:03:48.599> in<00:03:49.229> advanced<00:03:49.919> warfare<00:03:50.220> 2<00:03:50.729> if

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
most likely in advanced warfare 2 if

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.759 
most likely in advanced warfare 2 if
they<00:03:51.150> ever<00:03:51.269> decide<00:03:51.510> to<00:03:51.930> release<00:03:52.079> that<00:03:52.500> way

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
they ever decide to release that way

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.219 
they ever decide to release that way
farther<00:03:53.129> in<00:03:53.459> the<00:03:53.639> future<00:03:53.669> so<00:03:54.299> for<00:03:54.329> example<00:03:55.109> I

00:03:55.219 --> 00:03:55.229 
farther in the future so for example I

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:56.420 
farther in the future so for example I
don't<00:03:55.290> know<00:03:55.530> and<00:03:55.739> maybe<00:03:55.859> they<00:03:56.129> could<00:03:56.190> have

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
don't know and maybe they could have

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.129 
don't know and maybe they could have
like<00:03:56.609> a<00:03:56.639> whole<00:03:57.000> different<00:03:57.209> version<00:03:57.780> so<00:03:57.959> like

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
like a whole different version so like

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.710 
like a whole different version so like
the<00:03:58.290> cel-3<00:03:58.560> cauterizer<00:03:58.940> mark<00:03:59.940> 2<00:04:00.239> but<00:04:00.659> that

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
the cel-3 cauterizer mark 2 but that

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.969 
the cel-3 cauterizer mark 2 but that
doesn't<00:04:00.989> really<00:04:01.049> make<00:04:01.229> sense<00:04:01.500> because<00:04:01.739> you

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
doesn't really make sense because you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.589 
doesn't really make sense because you
can<00:04:02.099> upgrade<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.549> to<00:04:02.729> mark<00:04:02.940> do<00:04:03.090> so<00:04:03.269> I<00:04:03.299> don't

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:03.599 
can upgrade it to mark do so I don't

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.030 
can upgrade it to mark do so I don't
know<00:04:03.659> some<00:04:03.930> different<00:04:04.139> version<00:04:04.650> maybe<00:04:04.829> the

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
know some different version maybe the

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.159 
know some different version maybe the
self<00:04:05.280> or<00:04:05.579> carter<00:04:05.970> Iser<00:04:06.150> but<00:04:06.690> guys<00:04:06.840> this

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
self or carter Iser but guys this

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.170 
self or carter Iser but guys this
shotgun<00:04:07.470> is<00:04:07.829> definitely<00:04:08.340> one<00:04:08.519> of<00:04:08.549> the<00:04:08.699> best<00:04:08.970> I

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
shotgun is definitely one of the best I

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.149 
shotgun is definitely one of the best I
honestly<00:04:09.599> don't<00:04:09.840> really<00:04:10.049> even<00:04:10.260> consider<00:04:10.919> this

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
honestly don't really even consider this

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.069 
honestly don't really even consider this
like<00:04:11.400> a<00:04:11.579> wonder<00:04:12.120> weapon<00:04:12.299> in<00:04:12.629> the<00:04:12.720> sort<00:04:12.989> of

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
like a wonder weapon in the sort of

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.289 
like a wonder weapon in the sort of
sense<00:04:13.440> but<00:04:13.709> I<00:04:13.919> just<00:04:14.370> think<00:04:14.549> it's<00:04:14.699> just<00:04:14.909> a<00:04:15.000> very

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
sense but I just think it's just a very

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:16.909 
sense but I just think it's just a very
very<00:04:15.419> good<00:04:15.989> weapon<00:04:16.169> there<00:04:16.470> isn't<00:04:16.709> really<00:04:16.769> a

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:16.919 
very good weapon there isn't really a

00:04:16.919 --> 00:04:18.830 
very good weapon there isn't really a
term<00:04:17.280> that<00:04:17.459> you<00:04:17.519> can<00:04:17.669> say<00:04:17.970> with<00:04:18.120> extra<00:04:18.479> zombies

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
term that you can say with extra zombies

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.689 
term that you can say with extra zombies
in<00:04:18.989> terms<00:04:19.199> of<00:04:19.380> these<00:04:19.470> weapons<00:04:19.739> but<00:04:20.340> it's<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.519> lot

00:04:20.689 --> 00:04:20.699 
in terms of these weapons but it's a lot

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.610 
in terms of these weapons but it's a lot
of<00:04:20.729> fun<00:04:21.000> to<00:04:21.180> use<00:04:21.329> and<00:04:21.599> I<00:04:21.659> just<00:04:21.900> hope<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.440> in

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
of fun to use and I just hope that in

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.250 
of fun to use and I just hope that in
DLC<00:04:23.099> for<00:04:23.370> they<00:04:23.849> add<00:04:24.000> some<00:04:24.330> sort<00:04:24.539> of<00:04:24.659> perk<00:04:24.870> like

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
DLC for they add some sort of perk like

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.019 
DLC for they add some sort of perk like
double<00:04:25.710> tap<00:04:25.889> because<00:04:26.070> this<00:04:26.400> weapon<00:04:26.820> when<00:04:26.940> it

00:04:27.019 --> 00:04:27.029 
double tap because this weapon when it

00:04:27.029 --> 00:04:27.379 
double tap because this weapon when it
comes<00:04:27.210> to

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
comes to

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:30.140 
comes to
rate<00:04:27.749> of<00:04:27.900> fire<00:04:28.139> is<00:04:28.379> very<00:04:28.740> very<00:04:29.610> strange

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
rate of fire is very very strange

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.420 
rate of fire is very very strange
because<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.749> like<00:04:30.960> him<00:04:31.139> it's<00:04:31.349> fully<00:04:31.650> auto<00:04:32.039> but

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
because it like him it's fully auto but

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.249 
because it like him it's fully auto but
you<00:04:32.520> have<00:04:32.639> like<00:04:32.819> hold<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.270> trigger<00:04:33.569> and<00:04:33.870> then

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:34.259 
you have like hold the trigger and then

00:04:34.259 --> 00:04:36.260 
you have like hold the trigger and then
you<00:04:34.530> have<00:04:34.710> to<00:04:34.800> like<00:04:34.949> tap<00:04:35.219> it<00:04:35.490> to<00:04:35.610> make<00:04:35.939> it<00:04:36.090> shoe

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
you have to like tap it to make it shoe

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.689 
you have to like tap it to make it shoe
faster<00:04:36.779> it's<00:04:36.930> a<00:04:37.050> very<00:04:37.349> very<00:04:37.680> weird<00:04:38.039> weapon<00:04:38.550> in

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
faster it's a very very weird weapon in

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:40.999 
faster it's a very very weird weapon in
terms<00:04:38.939> of<00:04:39.090> its<00:04:39.240> design<00:04:39.449> and<00:04:39.900> rate<00:04:40.110> of<00:04:40.139> fire<00:04:40.289> but

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
terms of its design and rate of fire but

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:42.379 
terms of its design and rate of fire but
I<00:04:41.039> think<00:04:41.310> it's<00:04:41.430> still<00:04:41.639> a<00:04:41.819> great<00:04:42.150> weapon

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:42.389 
I think it's still a great weapon

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:44.779 
I think it's still a great weapon
nonetheless<00:04:43.110> so<00:04:43.650> anyways<00:04:43.949> guys<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.520> set<00:04:44.669> out

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:44.789 
nonetheless so anyways guys and set out

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:47.420 
nonetheless so anyways guys and set out
straight<00:04:45.150> into<00:04:45.389> our<00:04:45.419> number<00:04:46.050> two<00:04:46.259> spot<00:04:46.469> and<00:04:47.249> in

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
straight into our number two spot and in

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.989 
straight into our number two spot and in
today's<00:04:47.729> video<00:04:47.939> this<00:04:48.479> is<00:04:49.110> going<00:04:49.379> to<00:04:49.499> be<00:04:49.770> the

00:04:49.989 --> 00:04:49.999 
today's video this is going to be the

00:04:49.999 --> 00:04:52.969 
today's video this is going to be the
s12<00:04:50.999> now<00:04:51.330> this<00:04:51.509> is<00:04:51.689> actually<00:04:51.840> very<00:04:52.050> surprising

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:52.979 
s12 now this is actually very surprising

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:55.249 
s12 now this is actually very surprising
for<00:04:53.009> a<00:04:53.189> couple<00:04:53.490> of<00:04:53.550> people<00:04:53.879> but<00:04:54.210> the<00:04:54.389> s12<00:04:55.050> is

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
for a couple of people but the s12 is

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:58.070 
for a couple of people but the s12 is
one<00:04:55.740> of<00:04:55.919> the<00:04:56.069> best<00:04:56.490> weapons<00:04:56.939> in<00:04:57.300> exo-zombies

00:04:58.070 --> 00:04:58.080 
one of the best weapons in exo-zombies

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.439 
one of the best weapons in exo-zombies
to<00:04:58.499> date<00:04:58.710> and<00:04:58.919> in<00:04:59.039> my<00:04:59.189> personal<00:04:59.490> opinion<00:04:59.789> it's

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
to date and in my personal opinion it's

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.390 
to date and in my personal opinion it's
even<00:05:00.930> better<00:05:01.169> than<00:05:01.680> the<00:05:01.889> cel-3<00:05:02.159> cauterizer

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
even better than the cel-3 cauterizer

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.029 
even better than the cel-3 cauterizer
and<00:05:03.300> this<00:05:03.449> is<00:05:03.569> because<00:05:03.960> the<00:05:04.139> damage<00:05:04.710> per<00:05:04.740> shot

00:05:05.029 --> 00:05:05.039 
and this is because the damage per shot

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:07.700 
and this is because the damage per shot
is<00:05:05.520> a<00:05:05.759> lot<00:05:06.090> higher<00:05:06.419> than<00:05:06.719> the<00:05:06.840> carter<00:05:07.169> Iser<00:05:07.349> and

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:07.710 
is a lot higher than the carter Iser and

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.219 
is a lot higher than the carter Iser and
also<00:05:08.340> the<00:05:08.520> rate<00:05:08.699> of<00:05:08.879> fire<00:05:09.090> is<00:05:09.360> completely

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:10.229 
also the rate of fire is completely

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:12.860 
also the rate of fire is completely
normal<00:05:10.680> on<00:05:10.800> the<00:05:10.919> s12<00:05:11.400> it's<00:05:11.610> very<00:05:11.939> fast<00:05:12.300> it's

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
normal on the s12 it's very fast it's

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.869 
normal on the s12 it's very fast it's
very<00:05:13.169> powerful<00:05:13.469> and<00:05:13.889> you<00:05:14.039> can<00:05:14.189> definitely<00:05:14.430> use

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:14.879 
very powerful and you can definitely use
