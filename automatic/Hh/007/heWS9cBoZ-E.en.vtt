00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
runs you're gonna run out of glycogen

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:49.550 
runs you're gonna run out of glycogen
and<00:01:47.640> you're<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.329> teach<00:01:48.659> your<00:01:48.869> body<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.439> use

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
and you're gonna teach your body to use

fat as its presidential fuel and not

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
fat as its presidential fuel and not
glycogen<00:01:53.000> now<00:01:54.000> initially<00:01:54.570> you're<00:01:54.720> going<00:01:54.840> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
glycogen now initially you're going to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.330 
glycogen now initially you're going to
get<00:01:55.020> really<00:01:55.350> tired<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.950> you're<00:01:56.040> totally

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
get really tired and you're totally

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.940 
get really tired and you're totally
going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> bonk<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.030> runs<00:01:57.270> and<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:58.469> you<00:01:58.860> know

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
going to bonk on the runs and I you know

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.249 
going to bonk on the runs and I you know
after<00:01:59.250> about<00:01:59.430> now<00:02:00.180> or<00:02:00.210> 45<00:02:00.780> minutes<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.140> will

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
after about now or 45 minutes I will

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.530 
after about now or 45 minutes I will
start<00:02:01.500> bonking<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.189> my<00:02:02.340> run<00:02:02.579> but<00:02:03.240> then<00:02:03.390> your

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
start bonking in my run but then your

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.630 
start bonking in my run but then your
body<00:02:03.719> learns<00:02:04.140> how<00:02:04.469> to<00:02:04.500> metabolize<00:02:05.310> fats

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
body learns how to metabolize fats

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.900 
body learns how to metabolize fats
faster<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.689> uses<00:02:07.049> them<00:02:07.350> as<00:02:07.590> it's<00:02:08.119> most

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:10.910 
faster and uses them as it's most

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.890 
faster and uses them as it's most
as<00:02:11.910> primary<00:02:12.540> feel<00:02:12.780> summers<00:02:13.260> so<00:02:14.690> if<00:02:15.690> you're

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
as primary feel summers so if you're

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.960 
as primary feel summers so if you're
gonna<00:02:16.050> do<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.260> marathon<00:02:16.830> you<00:02:17.550> want<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.760> train

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
gonna do a marathon you want to train

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.790 
gonna do a marathon you want to train
your<00:02:18.120> body<00:02:18.240> to<00:02:18.480> burn<00:02:18.630> fat<00:02:18.690> and<00:02:19.140> not<00:02:19.320> glycogen

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
your body to burn fat and not glycogen

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.290 
your body to burn fat and not glycogen
because<00:02:19.980> you<00:02:20.100> only<00:02:20.310> have<00:02:20.520> a<00:02:20.550> limited<00:02:20.880> supply

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
because you only have a limited supply

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.320 
because you only have a limited supply
of<00:02:21.480> glycogen<00:02:22.080> maybe<00:02:22.710> ninety<00:02:23.310> minutes<00:02:23.670> if

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
of glycogen maybe ninety minutes if

you've got two hours worth of glycogen
in<00:02:28.590> your<00:02:28.710> body<00:02:29.000> but<00:02:30.000> most<00:02:30.210> people<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.630> about

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
in your body but most people it's about

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.200 
in your body but most people it's about
90<00:02:31.170> minutes<00:02:31.320> so<00:02:32.310> teach<00:02:32.520> your<00:02:32.700> body<00:02:32.820> to<00:02:33.000> burn

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:33.210 
90 minutes so teach your body to burn

the run after you've been running for
about<00:03:10.590> half<00:03:10.920> an<00:03:11.100> hour<00:03:11.220> you<00:03:11.910> can<00:03:11.940> consume<00:03:12.510> some

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
about half an hour you can consume some

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.810 
about half an hour you can consume some
carbohydrate<00:03:13.380> because<00:03:14.370> your<00:03:14.490> body<00:03:14.640> has

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
carbohydrate because your body has

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.970 
carbohydrate because your body has
already<00:03:14.970> kicked<00:03:15.300> into<00:03:15.480> a<00:03:15.660> fat<00:03:16.080> metabolism<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
already kicked into a fat metabolism and

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.190 
already kicked into a fat metabolism and
it's<00:03:17.790> not<00:03:18.030> likely<00:03:18.270> to<00:03:18.510> produce<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:18.870> lot<00:03:19.080> of

it's not likely to produce a lot of

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.990 
it's not likely to produce a lot of
insulin<00:03:19.590> so<00:03:20.220> you're<00:03:20.340> gonna<00:03:20.430> be<00:03:20.580> safe<00:03:20.790> but

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
insulin so you're gonna be safe but

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.690 
insulin so you're gonna be safe but
never<00:03:21.300> before<00:03:21.780> and<00:03:22.620> definitely<00:03:22.950> not<00:03:23.400> three

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
never before and definitely not three

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.690 
never before and definitely not three
hours<00:03:23.730> before<00:03:24.390> a<00:03:24.570> race<00:03:24.900> but<00:03:25.890> especially<00:03:26.520> in<00:03:26.640> a

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
hours before a race but especially in a

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.490 
hours before a race but especially in a
workout<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.420> want<00:03:27.570> to<00:03:27.660> train<00:03:27.930> your<00:03:27.960> body<00:03:28.290> to

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
workout you want to train your body to

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.250 
workout you want to train your body to
use<00:03:28.590> fat<00:03:28.890> oh<00:03:29.070> my<00:03:29.220> god<00:03:29.400> my<00:03:29.580> feet<00:03:29.790> are<00:03:29.970> so<00:03:30.330> cold

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
use fat oh my god my feet are so cold

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.240 
use fat oh my god my feet are so cold
they're<00:03:31.920> freeze<00:03:33.230> I'm<00:03:34.230> gonna<00:03:34.560> lose<00:03:34.770> my<00:03:34.800> toes

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
they're freeze I'm gonna lose my toes

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:53.310 
they're freeze I'm gonna lose my toes
this<00:03:35.490> is<00:03:35.670> nice

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:53.320 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:56.260 

so<00:03:54.320> why<00:03:54.500> would<00:03:54.710> you<00:03:54.830> want<00:03:55.040> to<00:03:55.130> use<00:03:55.700> fat<00:03:55.970> as<00:03:56.150> your

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:56.270 
so why would you want to use fat as your

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.990 
so why would you want to use fat as your
primary<00:03:56.510> fuel<00:03:56.960> rather<00:03:57.860> than<00:03:58.250> glycogen<00:03:58.850> no

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
primary fuel rather than glycogen no

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.870 
primary fuel rather than glycogen no
carbohydrate<00:03:59.720> stored<00:04:00.380> carbohydrate<00:04:00.980> well

two<00:04:02.360> reasons<00:04:02.690> number<00:04:02.990> one<00:04:03.590> glycogen<00:04:04.340> you<00:04:04.550> have

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
two reasons number one glycogen you have

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:07.150 
two reasons number one glycogen you have
a<00:04:04.730> limited<00:04:05.150> supply<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.890> have<00:04:07.040> an

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.160 
a limited supply that you have an

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.040 
a limited supply that you have an
unlimited<00:04:07.370> supply<00:04:07.910> pretty<00:04:08.450> much<00:04:08.660> you<00:04:08.900> could

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
unlimited supply pretty much you could

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.230 
unlimited supply pretty much you could

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
lactic acid build up in your system so

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:57.640 
lactic acid build up in your system so
you're<00:04:55.940> effectively<00:04:56.480> raising<00:04:57.050> your<00:04:57.230> lactate

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 
you're effectively raising your lactate

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.460 
you're effectively raising your lactate
threshold<00:04:58.390> so<00:04:59.390> that's<00:04:59.750> why<00:04:59.900> I'm<00:05:00.050> doing<00:05:00.260> these

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.470 
threshold so that's why I'm doing these

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:03.280 
threshold so that's why I'm doing these
long<00:05:00.710> runs<00:05:00.919> without<00:05:01.430> food<00:05:01.760> before<00:05:02.150> hand<00:05:02.360> teach

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:03.290 
long runs without food before hand teach

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.720 
long runs without food before hand teach
my<00:05:03.440> body<00:05:03.680> to<00:05:03.919> use<00:05:04.070> my<00:05:04.220> fat<00:05:04.430> stores<00:05:06.490> one<00:05:07.490> very

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:07.730 
my body to use my fat stores one very

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:08.980
