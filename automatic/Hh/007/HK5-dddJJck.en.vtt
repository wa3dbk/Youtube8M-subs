almost like see the clean oil go through
it<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.460> feel<00:01:27.119> confident<00:01:27.600> I'll<00:01:27.869> close<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.170> drain

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530

moving<00:01:44.909> parts<00:01:45.180> today<00:01:45.360> look<00:01:45.720> through<00:01:45.840> how<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
moving parts today look through how you

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.109 
moving parts today look through how you
doing<00:01:46.470> any<00:01:46.680> care<00:01:46.890> of<00:01:46.979> chef<00:01:47.159> how<00:01:47.310> you<00:01:47.369> doing<00:01:47.729> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
doing any care of chef how you doing and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.510 
doing any care of chef how you doing and
then<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.439> want<00:01:49.619> to<00:01:49.680> drop<00:01:49.829> around<00:01:50.189> with<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.340> flow

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
then you want to drop around with a flow

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.310 
then you want to drop around with a flow
a<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.729> bit<00:01:50.939> after<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.360> point<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:52.140> come

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
a little bit after that point you come

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
a little bit after that point you come
back<00:01:52.560> maybe<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.220> day<00:01:53.610> after<00:01:54.000> that<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.390> come

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
back maybe a day after that you come

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.209 
back maybe a day after that you come
back<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.140> drain<00:01:55.350> the<00:01:55.530> oil<00:01:55.560> again<00:01:56.009> and

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
back and you drain the oil again and

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.670 
back and you drain the oil again and
then<00:01:56.670> professional<00:01:57.329> oil<00:01:57.450> in<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.869> then<00:01:58.530> you're

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
then professional oil in and then you're

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.499 
then professional oil in and then you're
good<00:01:58.799> to<00:01:58.920> go<00:01:58.950> now<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> remember<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.119> had<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
good to go now if you remember I had a

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.830 
good to go now if you remember I had a
BB<00:02:00.659> t3<00:02:01.140> cam<00:02:01.350> in<00:02:01.560> here<00:02:01.590> and

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
BB t3 cam in here and

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.380 
BB t3 cam in here and
it<00:02:03.590> wasn't<00:02:03.829> gonna<00:02:03.950> be<00:02:04.009> low<00:02:04.159> in<00:02:04.310> torque<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.210> what

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:05.390 
it wasn't gonna be low in torque so what

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.270 
it wasn't gonna be low in torque so what
I<00:02:05.420> did<00:02:05.509> was<00:02:05.780> I<00:02:05.840> had<00:02:05.869> a<00:02:05.990> custom<00:02:06.350> grind<00:02:06.619> camp<00:02:06.890> and

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:07.280 
I did was I had a custom grind camp and

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.050 
I did was I had a custom grind camp and
from<00:02:08.149> engine<00:02:08.539> power<00:02:08.690> systems<00:02:09.200> and<00:02:10.030> when<00:02:11.030> I

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.060 
from engine power systems and when I

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.540 
from engine power systems and when I
took<00:02:11.150> enough<00:02:11.390> respected<00:02:11.959> it<00:02:12.349> was<00:02:12.830> incredible

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
took enough respected it was incredible

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.190 
took enough respected it was incredible
it<00:02:13.700> gave<00:02:13.910> me<00:02:13.940> not<00:02:14.360> only<00:02:14.569> to<00:02:14.660> give<00:02:14.840> me<00:02:14.989> the

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.200 
it gave me not only to give me the

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.900 
it gave me not only to give me the
low-end<00:02:15.620> torque<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:15.980> was<00:02:16.069> looking<00:02:16.280> for<00:02:16.489> it

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
low-end torque that I was looking for it

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.000 
low-end torque that I was looking for it
also<00:02:17.120> went<00:02:17.750> all<00:02:17.989> the<00:02:18.019> way<00:02:18.140> through<00:02:18.379> the<00:02:18.709> upper

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
also went all the way through the upper

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.890 
also went all the way through the upper
registry<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.879> was<00:02:20.030> just<00:02:20.180> making<00:02:20.480> powers

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
registry and it was just making powers

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.050 
registry and it was just making powers
it's<00:02:21.080> a<00:02:21.170> great<00:02:21.500> cam<00:02:21.739> and<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.580> doesn't<00:02:22.910> shake

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
it's a great cam and it doesn't shake

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.119 
it's a great cam and it doesn't shake
there<00:02:23.299> the<00:02:23.840> engine<00:02:24.470> doesn't<00:02:24.590> shake<00:02:24.860> as<00:02:24.980> much

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:25.129 
there the engine doesn't shake as much

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:26.680 
there the engine doesn't shake as much
as<00:02:25.280> it<00:02:25.370> used<00:02:25.519> to<00:02:25.580> shake<00:02:25.849> and<00:02:26.000> believe<00:02:26.510> it<00:02:26.629> or

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:26.690 
as it used to shake and believe it or

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.960 
as it used to shake and believe it or
not<00:02:26.810> maybe<00:02:27.170> I'm<00:02:27.349> I<00:02:27.620> don't<00:02:27.980> know<00:02:28.069> but<00:02:28.310> it<00:02:28.700> seems

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
not maybe I'm I don't know but it seems

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.280 
not maybe I'm I don't know but it seems
like<00:02:29.120> the<00:02:29.209> engines<00:02:29.510> the<00:02:29.629> cars<00:02:29.840> run<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.049> lot

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
like the engines the cars run a lot

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.789 
like the engines the cars run a lot
cooler<00:02:30.500> by<00:02:31.220> 20<00:02:31.489> degrees<00:02:32.349> go<00:02:33.349> figure

00:02:33.789 --> 00:02:33.799 
cooler by 20 degrees go figure

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.620 
cooler by 20 degrees go figure
now<00:02:34.099> I<00:02:34.129> do<00:02:34.310> understand<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.329> latest

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
now I do understand that the latest

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.050 
now I do understand that the latest
thing<00:02:35.810> is<00:02:35.989> to<00:02:36.079> have<00:02:36.230> DBT<00:02:36.680> in<00:02:36.769> your<00:02:36.920> car<00:02:37.190> but<00:02:37.459> you

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
thing is to have DBT in your car but you

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.509 
thing is to have DBT in your car but you
know<00:02:38.380> for<00:02:39.380> some<00:02:39.560> reason<00:02:39.590> it<00:02:40.160> didn't<00:02:40.400> work

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
know for some reason it didn't work

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.089 
know for some reason it didn't work
correct<00:02:40.849> for<00:02:41.000> me<00:02:41.150> in<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:41.660> car<00:02:41.930> maybe<00:02:42.500> because

00:02:43.089 --> 00:02:43.099 
correct for me in this car maybe because

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:44.500 
correct for me in this car maybe because
my<00:02:43.250> car's<00:02:43.489> a<00:02:43.579> stick<00:02:43.790> now<00:02:44.000> this<00:02:44.239> car<00:02:44.390> was

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
my car's a stick now this car was

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.250 
my car's a stick now this car was
automatic<00:02:45.280> maybe<00:02:46.280> it<00:02:46.400> worked<00:02:46.670> a<00:02:46.730> lot<00:02:46.849> better

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
automatic maybe it worked a lot better

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.680 
automatic maybe it worked a lot better
hmm<00:02:48.549> maybe<00:02:49.549> that's<00:02:49.760> why<00:02:49.879> Jim<00:02:50.180> never<00:02:50.390> released

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
hmm maybe that's why Jim never released

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.509 
hmm maybe that's why Jim never released

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:56.900 
with the introduction of our sights a

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.770 
with the introduction of our sights a
reintroduction<00:02:57.290> at<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.799> Ltd<00:02:58.160> engine<00:02:58.780> hmm

maybe<00:03:00.470> Jim<00:03:00.709> head<00:03:00.950> up<00:03:01.040> right<00:03:01.220> although<00:03:01.989> who

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
maybe Jim head up right although who

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.309 
maybe Jim head up right although who
knows<00:03:04.329> anyways<00:03:05.360> looking<00:03:05.900> at<00:03:06.019> the<00:03:06.110> clock<00:03:06.290> on

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:06.319 
knows anyways looking at the clock on

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
the wall why should I say ceiling it's

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.809 
the wall why should I say ceiling it's
