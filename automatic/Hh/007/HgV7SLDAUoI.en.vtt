00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
start this this little project off by by

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.729 
start this this little project off by by
simply<00:00:54.840> cutting<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.199> pages<00:00:55.469> out<00:00:55.530> of<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.680> book

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
simply cutting the pages out of the book

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.250 
simply cutting the pages out of the book
so<00:00:56.640> on<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.789> back<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:56.969> each<00:00:57.210> page<00:00:57.570> you'll<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.050> a

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
so on the back of each page you'll see a

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.950 
so on the back of each page you'll see a
little<00:00:58.710> dotted<00:00:58.980> line<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.940> grab<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.180> metal<00:01:00.750> ruler

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
little dotted line so grab a metal ruler

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.130 
little dotted line so grab a metal ruler
and<00:01:01.320> a<00:01:02.239> basically<00:01:03.239> an<00:01:03.420> exacto<00:01:03.809> blade<00:01:03.840> works

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
and a basically an exacto blade works

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.320 
and a basically an exacto blade works
great<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.769> just<00:01:05.400> slowly<00:01:05.610> start<00:01:06.000> cutting

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
great and just slowly start cutting

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
great and just slowly start cutting
through<00:01:06.570> each<00:01:06.720> one<00:01:06.960> of<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.110> pages<00:01:07.320> as<00:01:08.159> you<00:01:08.369> go

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
through each one of the pages as you go

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.800 
through each one of the pages as you go
you<00:01:08.549> may<00:01:08.820> cut<00:01:09.030> through<00:01:09.210> two<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.510> three<00:01:09.689> pages

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
you may cut through two or three pages

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.899 
you may cut through two or three pages
at<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> time<00:01:10.140> that's<00:01:10.530> fine<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.549> you'll<00:01:11.760> see

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
at a time that's fine but as you'll see

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.380 
at a time that's fine but as you'll see
the<00:01:12.060> pages<00:01:12.420> pop<00:01:12.750> out<00:01:12.960> very<00:01:13.470> nicely<00:01:14.240> so<00:01:15.240> once

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
the pages pop out very nicely so once

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.330 
the pages pop out very nicely so once
you<00:01:15.479> get<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.840> end<00:01:15.990> of<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> book<00:01:16.470> you'll

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
you get to the end of the book you'll

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.219 
you get to the end of the book you'll
have<00:01:17.520> yourself<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.180> nice<00:01:18.479> collection<00:01:18.990> of

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
horses and I'll tell you right now I'm

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.560 
horses and I'll tell you right now I'm
not<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> crafty<00:01:22.290> person<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.890> this<00:01:23.880> actually<00:01:24.150> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
not a crafty person and this actually is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.170 
not a crafty person and this actually is
quite<00:01:25.080> simple<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.619> do<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.610> let's<00:01:26.790> get<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.090> the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
quite simple to do so let's get to the

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.260 
quite simple to do so let's get to the
glues<00:01:27.860> now<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.920> best<00:01:29.400> glue<00:01:29.640> that<00:01:29.790> we<00:01:29.909> prefer

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
glues now the best glue that we prefer

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.539 
glues now the best glue that we prefer
to<00:01:30.390> use<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:31.049> liquid<00:01:31.530> glue<00:01:31.860> pen<00:01:32.100> now<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.490> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
to use is the liquid glue pen now it's a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.630 
to use is the liquid glue pen now it's a
water<00:01:32.759> pace<00:01:33.090> glue<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:34.159> what<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.250> do<00:01:35.400> is<00:01:35.430> just

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
water pace glue and what you do is just

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.929 
water pace glue and what you do is just
grab<00:01:35.880> the<00:01:36.030> pan<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.829> as<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:38.340> can<00:01:38.460> see<00:01:38.490> it's

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
grab the pan and as you can see it's

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.370 
grab the pan and as you can see it's
it's<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.390> easy<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.659> work<00:01:39.780> with<00:01:39.840> very<00:01:40.259> much

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
it's very easy to work with very much

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.950 
it's very easy to work with very much
like<00:01:40.530> using<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.860> pan<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.340> just<00:01:42.119> cover<00:01:42.720> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
like using a pan and just cover the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.980 
like using a pan and just cover the
entire<00:01:43.079> square<00:01:43.920> with<00:01:44.159> lots<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.579> glue<00:01:44.899> put<00:01:45.899> it

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
entire square with lots of glue put it

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.230 
entire square with lots of glue put it
down<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.500> squeeze<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> out<00:01:47.549> all<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:48.090> air

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
down and squeeze you out all the air

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.330 
down and squeeze you out all the air
bubbles<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:49.350> you'll<00:01:49.560> probably<00:01:49.920> get<00:01:50.130> some

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bubbles now you'll probably get some

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.219 
bubbles now you'll probably get some
excess<00:01:50.729> glue<00:01:50.939> going<00:01:51.180> over<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.450> edges<00:01:51.600> that's

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
excess glue going over the edges that's

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.410 
excess glue going over the edges that's
not<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> problem<00:01:52.770> in<00:01:53.280> fact<00:01:53.820> it<00:01:54.000> actually<00:01:54.060> works

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
not a problem in fact it actually works

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.929 
not a problem in fact it actually works
really<00:01:54.509> well<00:01:54.930> because<00:01:55.549> that<00:01:56.549> actually<00:01:56.820> acts

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
really well because that actually acts

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:58.160 
really well because that actually acts
as<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.119> sealant<00:01:57.450> around<00:01:57.659> all<00:01:57.960> the<00:01:58.049> other

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
as a sealant around all the other

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.260 
as a sealant around all the other
squares<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.799> as<00:01:59.219> you<00:01:59.399> go<00:01:59.549> along<00:01:59.640> they<00:02:00.149> all

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
squares and as you go along they all

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.139 
squares and as you go along they all
piece<00:02:00.509> together<00:02:00.719> that<00:02:01.049> much<00:02:01.200> easier<00:02:01.939> so<00:02:02.939> just

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
piece together that much easier so just

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.719 
piece together that much easier so just
just<00:02:03.450> go<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.259> town<00:02:04.469> now<00:02:04.710> now<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.399> start<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
just go to town now now if you start the

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.300 
just go to town now now if you start the
top<00:02:05.969> left<00:02:06.240> corner<00:02:06.329> just<00:02:07.259> put<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.950> square

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
top left corner just put one square

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.210 
top left corner just put one square
side-by-side<00:02:09.090> going<00:02:09.599> all<00:02:09.810> along<00:02:10.200> just<00:02:11.009> take

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
side-by-side going all along just take

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.400 
side-by-side going all along just take
your<00:02:11.370> time<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:11.930> as<00:02:12.930> you

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
your time and as you

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.380 
your time and as you
slowly<00:02:14.010> watch<00:02:14.430> the<00:02:14.610> neural<00:02:14.850> come<00:02:15.000> to<00:02:15.120> life<00:02:15.270> I

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
slowly watch the neural come to life I

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.960 
slowly watch the neural come to life I
mean<00:02:15.510> obviously<00:02:15.780> this<00:02:15.930> is<00:02:16.110> fast<00:02:16.470> but<00:02:16.880> as<00:02:17.880> you

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
mean obviously this is fast but as you

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.640 
mean obviously this is fast but as you
take<00:02:18.180> your<00:02:18.210> time<00:02:18.450> and<00:02:18.510> go<00:02:18.690> through<00:02:18.990> it<00:02:19.140> you'll

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
take your time and go through it you'll

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.200 
take your time and go through it you'll
see<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.130> bigger<00:02:20.340> picture<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> going<00:02:21.120> to

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:21.210 
see that the bigger picture is going to

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:23.450 
see that the bigger picture is going to
start<00:02:21.390> to<00:02:21.510> come<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.810> life<00:02:22.020> now<00:02:22.800> I<00:02:22.830> know<00:02:23.040> every

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
start to come to life now I know every

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.850 
start to come to life now I know every
time<00:02:23.640> I<00:02:23.670> do<00:02:23.790> this<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.720> always<00:02:25.200> blows<00:02:25.320> my<00:02:25.620> mind

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
time I do this it always blows my mind

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.830 
time I do this it always blows my mind
that<00:02:26.010> what<00:02:26.910> I'm<00:02:27.000> looking<00:02:27.300> at<00:02:27.390> each<00:02:27.570> one<00:02:27.810> of

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that what I'm looking at each one of

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.010 
that what I'm looking at each one of
these<00:02:27.990> these<00:02:28.650> paintings<00:02:29.390> each<00:02:30.390> one<00:02:30.750> has<00:02:30.990> a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
these these paintings each one has a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.050 
these these paintings each one has a
life<00:02:31.260> of<00:02:31.380> its<00:02:31.500> own<00:02:31.710> and<00:02:31.950> you're<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:32.790> more

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
life of its own and you're just more

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.000 
life of its own and you're just more
into<00:02:33.360> the<00:02:33.780> stories<00:02:34.110> behind<00:02:34.200> each<00:02:34.560> one<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:34.920> the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
into the stories behind each one of the

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.250 
into the stories behind each one of the
horses<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.550> within<00:02:35.730> the<00:02:35.880> mural<00:02:36.270> then<00:02:37.140> all<00:02:37.230> of

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
horses it's within the mural then all of

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.390 
horses it's within the mural then all of
a<00:02:37.380> sudden<00:02:37.410> you'll<00:02:37.710> start<00:02:37.920> to<00:02:37.950> see<00:02:38.040> little

a sudden you'll start to see little

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.710 
a sudden you'll start to see little
hints<00:02:38.700> of<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.940> of<00:02:39.180> the<00:02:39.270> bigger<00:02:39.450> picture

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
hints of the of the bigger picture

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
hints of the of the bigger picture
coming<00:02:40.020> to<00:02:40.200> life<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.680> it<00:02:41.460> just<00:02:41.520> boggles<00:02:41.880> your

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
coming to life and it just boggles your

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.400 
coming to life and it just boggles your
mind<00:02:42.270> that<00:02:42.690> that<00:02:42.840> each<00:02:43.050> one<00:02:43.260> of<00:02:43.290> these

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
mind that that each one of these

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.690 
mind that that each one of these
paintings<00:02:43.800> done<00:02:43.980> by<00:02:44.040> artists<00:02:44.460> from<00:02:44.520> around

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
paintings done by artists from around

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.730 
paintings done by artists from around
the<00:02:44.970> world<00:02:45.120> is<00:02:45.420> actually<00:02:46.350> going<00:02:46.440> to<00:02:46.590> make<00:02:46.710> a

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
the world is actually going to make a

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.190 
the world is actually going to make a
much<00:02:47.220> bigger<00:02:47.460> picture<00:02:47.970> it<00:02:48.510> actually<00:02:48.900> is<00:02:49.080> very

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
much bigger picture it actually is very

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.720 
much bigger picture it actually is very
exciting<00:02:49.770> you'll<00:02:49.890> see<00:02:50.070> once<00:02:50.250> you<00:02:50.340> get<00:02:50.520> halfway

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
exciting you'll see once you get halfway

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.670 
exciting you'll see once you get halfway
through<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.120> project<00:02:53.240> so<00:02:54.240> there<00:02:54.420> it<00:02:54.510> is<00:02:54.680> it's

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
through the project so there it is it's

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.260 
through the project so there it is it's
the<00:02:55.860> actual<00:02:56.010> horse<00:02:56.460> from<00:02:56.790> made<00:02:57.000> up<00:02:57.120> of

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:57.270

is Luis la voix and I'm the director of
of<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.200> project<00:03:04.970> so<00:03:05.970> we're<00:03:06.240> going<00:03:06.360> to<00:03:06.420> make<00:03:06.540> a

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
of this project so we're going to make a

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.090 
of this project so we're going to make a
grid<00:03:06.990> a<00:03:07.550> grid<00:03:08.550> is<00:03:08.700> is<00:03:09.180> is<00:03:09.600> is<00:03:09.990> actually<00:03:10.860> a<00:03:10.920> lot

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:11.100 
grid a grid is is is is actually a lot

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.670 
grid a grid is is is is actually a lot
of<00:03:11.280> fun<00:03:11.990> putting<00:03:12.990> one<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.350> these<00:03:13.380> books

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
of fun putting one of these books

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.820 
of fun putting one of these books
together<00:03:13.920> as<00:03:14.250> a<00:03:14.280> grid<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:14.990> basically<00:03:15.990> to<00:03:16.530> get

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:16.830 
together as a grid so basically to get

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:18.470 
together as a grid so basically to get
the<00:03:16.950> measurements<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.520> the<00:03:17.580> grid<00:03:17.850> as<00:03:18.090> you<00:03:18.360> can

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
the measurements of the grid as you can

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.060 
the measurements of the grid as you can
see<00:03:18.720> here<00:03:19.020> we're<00:03:19.230> using<00:03:19.410> the<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.880> book

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
see here we're using the the book

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.530 
see here we're using the the book
distance<00:03:23.070> for<00:03:23.670> our<00:03:23.850> measurements<00:03:24.390> you

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 
distance for our measurements you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.050 
distance for our measurements you
measure<00:03:24.720> one<00:03:25.020> tick<00:03:25.260> the<00:03:26.220> next<00:03:26.610> tick<00:03:26.760> if<00:03:26.910> you've

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
measure one tick the next tick if you've

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:28.400 
measure one tick the next tick if you've
ever<00:03:27.209> built<00:03:27.390> a<00:03:27.570> grid<00:03:27.750> before<00:03:27.959> you<00:03:28.230> just

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
ever built a grid before you just

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.990 
ever built a grid before you just
basically<00:03:28.560> measure<00:03:29.070> one<00:03:29.340> end<00:03:29.550> of<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.760> board

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
basically measure one end of the board

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.630 
basically measure one end of the board
and<00:03:30.150> you<00:03:30.660> go<00:03:30.840> way<00:03:30.990> on<00:03:31.200> we<00:03:31.709> go<00:03:32.040> way<00:03:32.190> down<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.550> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
and you go way on we go way down to the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.920 
and you go way on we go way down to the
other<00:03:32.730> end<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.090> measure<00:03:33.270> the<00:03:33.480> other<00:03:33.600> end<00:03:33.810> of

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
other end to measure the other end of

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.060 
other end to measure the other end of
the<00:03:33.990> board<00:03:34.110> and<00:03:34.230> then<00:03:34.380> you<00:03:34.470> draw<00:03:34.709> your<00:03:34.890> line

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
the board and then you draw your line

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.250 
the board and then you draw your line
straight<00:03:35.520> across<00:03:35.760> and<00:03:36.180> then<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.900> draw<00:03:37.110> your

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
straight across and then you draw your

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.380 
straight across and then you draw your
lines<00:03:37.470> horizontal<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:38.400> here's<00:03:38.580> Phil<00:03:38.880> he's

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
lines horizontal so here's Phil he's

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.890 
lines horizontal so here's Phil he's
doing<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.870> vertical<00:03:40.709> lines<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.750> then<00:03:42.750> he's

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
doing the vertical lines and then he's

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:44.449 
doing the vertical lines and then he's
going<00:03:43.050> to<00:03:43.140> do<00:03:43.260> the<00:03:43.380> horizontal<00:03:43.650> lines<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:44.459 
going to do the horizontal lines and

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:46.610 
going to do the horizontal lines and
where<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.820> lines<00:03:45.000> meet<00:03:45.300> make<00:03:45.570> your<00:03:45.780> grid<00:03:45.989> so

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
where the lines meet make your grid so

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.410 
where the lines meet make your grid so
it's<00:03:46.770> very<00:03:46.890> simple<00:03:47.220> if<00:03:47.760> you've<00:03:47.880> never<00:03:48.030> built<00:03:48.270> a

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
it's very simple if you've never built a

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:49.940 
it's very simple if you've never built a
grid<00:03:48.600> before<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:49.200> take<00:03:49.350> your<00:03:49.470> time<00:03:49.530> it's

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
grid before just take your time it's

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.310 
grid before just take your time it's
pretty<00:03:50.160> easy<00:03:50.310> because<00:03:51.239> this<00:03:51.690> mural<00:03:51.959> is<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.140> lot

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
pretty easy because this mural is a lot

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.440 
pretty easy because this mural is a lot
bigger<00:03:52.500> than<00:03:52.739> the<00:03:52.890> last<00:03:53.070> mural<00:03:53.489> we<00:03:53.610> did<00:03:53.790> you're

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
bigger than the last mural we did you're

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.430 
bigger than the last mural we did you're
going<00:03:54.600> to<00:03:54.690> end<00:03:54.900> up<00:03:55.020> using<00:03:55.260> two<00:03:55.650> sheets<00:03:56.010> of<00:03:56.390> of

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
going to end up using two sheets of of

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.320 
going to end up using two sheets of of
core<00:03:58.440> class<00:03:58.709> or<00:03:59.040> whatever<00:03:59.310> you<00:03:59.760> used<00:04:00.000> for<00:04:00.270> the

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
core class or whatever you used for the

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.900 
core class or whatever you used for the
last<00:04:00.570> one<00:04:01.010> or<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.130> could<00:04:02.250> do<00:04:02.340> it<00:04:02.430> directly<00:04:02.580> on

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
last one or you could do it directly on

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.190 
last one or you could do it directly on
the<00:04:03.000> wall<00:04:03.530> so<00:04:05.180> after<00:04:06.180> you<00:04:06.540> build<00:04:06.750> your<00:04:06.900> grid

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
the wall so after you build your grid

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.810 
the wall so after you build your grid
your<00:04:07.410> get<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.560> number<00:04:07.800> everything<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.550> the

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
your get a number everything and the

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.970 
your get a number everything and the
numbers<00:04:09.120> are<00:04:09.180> going<00:04:09.300> to<00:04:09.390> line<00:04:09.630> up<00:04:09.840> with<00:04:10.620> the

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
numbers are going to line up with the

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.729 
numbers are going to line up with the
pages<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.670> the<00:04:11.880> book<00:04:12.060> so<00:04:12.390> page<00:04:12.989> number<00:04:13.350> one<00:04:13.530> is

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:13.739 
pages of the book so page number one is

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.599 
pages of the book so page number one is
going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:13.980> go<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.370> number<00:04:14.760> one<00:04:15.169> so<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:17.400> best

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
going to go in number one so the best

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.580 
going to go in number one so the best
way<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.940> do<00:04:18.180> this<00:04:18.359> is<00:04:18.419> to<00:04:18.630> shuffle<00:04:19.080> all<00:04:19.410> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
way to do this is to shuffle all the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.890 
way to do this is to shuffle all the
pages<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.459> that<00:04:20.489> when<00:04:20.760> you<00:04:20.850> pull<00:04:21.419> out<00:04:21.450> a<00:04:21.600> page

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
pages so that when you pull out a page

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.750 
pages so that when you pull out a page
you're<00:04:22.380> going<00:04:22.530> to<00:04:22.590> randomly<00:04:22.950> put<00:04:23.340> it<00:04:23.460> on<00:04:23.580> so

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
you're going to randomly put it on so

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.650 
you're going to randomly put it on so
you<00:04:23.850> don't<00:04:23.880> know<00:04:24.090> which<00:04:24.270> page<00:04:24.479> you're<00:04:24.600> going

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
you don't know which page you're going

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.730 
you don't know which page you're going
to<00:04:24.810> pull<00:04:24.960> out<00:04:25.080> and<00:04:25.200> you<00:04:25.260> don't<00:04:25.440> know<00:04:25.530> where

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
to pull out and you don't know where

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.860 
to pull out and you don't know where
it's<00:04:25.860> going<00:04:26.010> to<00:04:26.039> go<00:04:26.100> on<00:04:26.220> the<00:04:26.400> grid

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:26.870 
it's going to go on the grid

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.530 
it's going to go on the grid
this<00:04:27.870> allows<00:04:28.230> you<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.680> build<00:04:29.100> your<00:04:29.310> mural<00:04:30.030> over

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
this allows you to build your mural over

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.990 
this allows you to build your mural over
a<00:04:30.570> period<00:04:31.170> of<00:04:31.440> like<00:04:31.770> two<00:04:32.400> weeks<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.970> year

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
a period of like two weeks a year

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.210 
a period of like two weeks a year
however<00:04:33.540> long<00:04:33.870> you<00:04:33.990> want<00:04:34.080> to<00:04:34.170> build<00:04:34.350> it<00:04:34.530> some

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
however long you want to build it some

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.710 
however long you want to build it some
people<00:04:35.460> do<00:04:35.580> these<00:04:35.700> like<00:04:35.910> devotionals<00:04:36.570> they'll

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
people do these like devotionals they'll

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:37.940 
people do these like devotionals they'll
pull<00:04:36.900> out<00:04:36.990> their<00:04:37.170> page<00:04:37.350> and<00:04:37.650> they'll<00:04:37.740> read

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
pull out their page and they'll read

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.380 
pull out their page and they'll read
about<00:04:38.160> that<00:04:38.340> horse<00:04:38.640> and<00:04:38.850> then<00:04:39.000> they'll<00:04:39.120> stick

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:39.390 
about that horse and then they'll stick

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.840 
about that horse and then they'll stick
it<00:04:39.510> on<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.930> then<00:04:39.960> that<00:04:40.800> way<00:04:40.920> they<00:04:41.070> can<00:04:41.250> they

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
it on and then that way they can they

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.910 
it on and then that way they can they
can<00:04:41.880> slowly<00:04:42.390> see<00:04:42.870> their<00:04:43.110> mural<00:04:43.590> coming

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
can slowly see their mural coming

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.040 
can slowly see their mural coming
together<00:04:44.040> over<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.880> course<00:04:45.210> of<00:04:45.570> a<00:04:45.660> long<00:04:45.780> time

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
together over the course of a long time

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.040 
together over the course of a long time
the<00:04:46.800> other<00:04:46.920> way<00:04:47.100> of<00:04:47.220> doing<00:04:47.490> it<00:04:47.580> is<00:04:47.760> to<00:04:48.150> do<00:04:48.900> it

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
the other way of doing it is to do it

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.590 
the other way of doing it is to do it
like<00:04:49.200> a<00:04:49.230> team<00:04:49.590> building<00:04:50.210> which<00:04:51.210> is<00:04:51.240> another

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:51.600 
like a team building which is another

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.140 
like a team building which is another
great<00:04:51.780> way<00:04:52.020> you<00:04:52.650> you<00:04:52.980> have<00:04:53.070> a<00:04:53.100> team<00:04:53.370> of<00:04:53.400> you

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:54.150 
great way you you have a team of you

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.660 
great way you you have a team of you
know<00:04:54.240> 10<00:04:54.630> 20<00:04:54.930> people<00:04:55.380> and<00:04:55.560> you<00:04:56.070> divide<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.640> the

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:56.670 
know 10 20 people and you divide all the

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:58.850 
know 10 20 people and you divide all the
pages<00:04:56.970> up<00:04:57.240> between<00:04:57.480> everybody<00:04:57.840> and<00:04:58.200> have<00:04:58.680> them

all go up there you know one one person
at<00:05:01.680> a<00:05:01.710> time<00:05:01.800> sticking<00:05:02.640> it<00:05:02.760> down<00:05:05.690> here<00:05:06.690> we're

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:06.870 
at a time sticking it down here we're

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.390 
at a time sticking it down here we're
putting<00:05:07.110> some<00:05:07.290> glue<00:05:07.530> on<00:05:07.560> as<00:05:07.860> you<00:05:07.980> can<00:05:08.100> see<00:05:08.250> he's

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
putting some glue on as you can see he's

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.010 
putting some glue on as you can see he's
putting<00:05:08.670> lots<00:05:08.850> of<00:05:09.090> glue<00:05:09.300> on<00:05:09.330> it's<00:05:09.660> better<00:05:09.870> to

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
putting lots of glue on it's better to

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:12.140 
putting lots of glue on it's better to
put<00:05:10.200> more<00:05:10.470> glue<00:05:10.680> than<00:05:10.950> not<00:05:11.100> enough<00:05:11.250> and<00:05:11.610> this

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:12.150 
put more glue than not enough and this

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:13.670 
put more glue than not enough and this
this<00:05:12.480> type<00:05:12.780> of<00:05:12.810> glue<00:05:13.140> is<00:05:13.290> actually<00:05:13.650> very

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
this type of glue is actually very

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.750 
this type of glue is actually very
forgiving<00:05:14.490> as<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.870> when<00:05:16.380> it<00:05:16.500> dries<00:05:16.950> it<00:05:16.980> dries

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:17.760 
forgiving as it's when it dries it dries

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.440 
forgiving as it's when it dries it dries
crystal<00:05:18.630> clear<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:20.190> doesn't<00:05:20.580> leave<00:05:21.300> your

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:21.450 
crystal clear so it doesn't leave your

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.420 
crystal clear so it doesn't leave your
mural<00:05:21.810> looking<00:05:22.170> all<00:05:22.290> streaky<00:05:23.010> it<00:05:23.130> actually

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:23.430 
mural looking all streaky it actually

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.950 
mural looking all streaky it actually
kind<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.670> gives<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.970> a<00:05:24.060> bit<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.300> a<00:05:24.390> sealant<00:05:25.610> so

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:26.960 
kind of gives it a bit of a sealant so

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.460 
kind of gives it a bit of a sealant so
use<00:05:27.960> a<00:05:27.990> credit<00:05:28.350> card<00:05:28.500> or<00:05:28.980> one<00:05:29.250> of<00:05:29.340> these<00:05:29.460> craft

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:30.470 
use a credit card or one of these craft

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:32.510 
use a credit card or one of these craft
squeegees<00:05:31.470> and<00:05:31.680> just<00:05:31.800> squeeze<00:05:32.040> out<00:05:32.190> all<00:05:32.250> the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
squeegees and just squeeze out all the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.100 
squeegees and just squeeze out all the
glue<00:05:32.610> and<00:05:32.820> just<00:05:32.940> pull<00:05:33.270> it<00:05:33.420> all<00:05:33.540> out<00:05:33.570> like<00:05:33.930> pull

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:36.180 
it right over the next pitcher like

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.030 
it right over the next pitcher like
don't<00:05:36.420> be<00:05:36.540> afraid<00:05:36.840> of<00:05:36.870> the<00:05:37.170> of<00:05:37.470> the<00:05:37.800> glue

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:38.040 
don't be afraid of the of the glue

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.790 
don't be afraid of the of the glue
getting<00:05:38.400> all<00:05:38.490> over<00:05:38.760> the<00:05:38.850> place<00:05:39.680> unless<00:05:40.680> you

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:40.800 
getting all over the place unless you

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.410 
getting all over the place unless you
use<00:05:40.920> a<00:05:40.950> different<00:05:41.400> type<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.610> glue<00:05:42.000> and<00:05:42.210> then

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.420 
use a different type of glue and then

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.670 
use a different type of glue and then
that<00:05:42.630> way<00:05:42.780> you're<00:05:42.960> going<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.170> have<00:05:43.320> to<00:05:43.500> do<00:05:43.650> a

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:43.680 
that way you're going to have to do a

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.460 
that way you're going to have to do a
little<00:05:44.040> test<00:05:44.430> so<00:05:45.270> here<00:05:45.570> you<00:05:45.690> see<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.960> pictures

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
little test so here you see the pictures

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:49.520 
little test so here you see the pictures
going<00:05:46.770> on<00:05:46.920> randomly<00:05:47.840> none<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.990> the<00:05:49.080> kids<00:05:49.290> knew

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:49.530 
going on randomly none of the kids knew

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:51.410 
going on randomly none of the kids knew
what<00:05:49.950> the<00:05:50.100> final<00:05:50.340> picture<00:05:50.670> was<00:05:51.000> going<00:05:51.180> to<00:05:51.240> be

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:51.420 
what the final picture was going to be

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:54.200 
what the final picture was going to be
these<00:05:51.630> are<00:05:51.690> kids<00:05:51.930> in<00:05:52.140> my<00:05:52.230> neighborhood<00:05:52.260> and<00:05:53.210> we

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:54.210 
these are kids in my neighborhood and we

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:55.640 
these are kids in my neighborhood and we
asked<00:05:54.510> them<00:05:54.570> to<00:05:54.780> come<00:05:54.930> and<00:05:54.990> help<00:05:55.290> us<00:05:55.410> build

00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:55.650 
asked them to come and help us build

00:05:55.650 --> 00:05:57.530 
asked them to come and help us build
this<00:05:55.890> thing<00:05:55.950> they<00:05:56.910> actually<00:05:57.030> had<00:05:57.300> a<00:05:57.330> lot<00:05:57.510> of

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
this thing they actually had a lot of

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.810 
this thing they actually had a lot of
fun<00:05:57.840> coming<00:05:58.110> out<00:05:58.320> and<00:05:58.470> building<00:05:59.160> it<00:05:59.340> as<00:05:59.640> they

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
fun coming out and building it as they

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.370 
fun coming out and building it as they
started<00:06:00.180> to<00:06:00.300> see<00:06:00.510> that<00:06:00.690> some<00:06:00.900> of<00:06:00.960> these<00:06:01.050> lines

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
started to see that some of these lines

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.350 
started to see that some of these lines
were<00:06:01.620> making<00:06:01.980> things<00:06:02.250> they<00:06:02.850> started<00:06:03.210> getting

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
were making things they started getting

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:05.420 
were making things they started getting
really<00:06:03.480> excited<00:06:04.110> and<00:06:04.230> they<00:06:04.350> started<00:06:05.010> really

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:05.430 
really excited and they started really

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:08.860 
really excited and they started really
you<00:06:06.330> know<00:06:06.420> speeding<00:06:06.870> up<00:06:07.110> the<00:06:07.350> process<00:06:07.530> of<00:06:08.130> it

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:08.870 
you know speeding up the process of it

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.290 
you know speeding up the process of it
so<00:06:09.870> there<00:06:10.380> you<00:06:10.530> have<00:06:10.560> it<00:06:10.770> a<00:06:11.070> life-size<00:06:11.700> mural

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
so there you have it a life-size mural

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.870 
so there you have it a life-size mural
of<00:06:12.420> a<00:06:12.840> horse<00:06:13.160> so<00:06:14.160> if<00:06:14.340> you<00:06:14.460> want<00:06:14.670> to<00:06:14.760> have<00:06:14.850> a

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:14.880 
of a horse so if you want to have a

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:17.930 
of a horse so if you want to have a
mural<00:06:15.270> that's<00:06:16.080> the<00:06:16.470> that's<00:06:17.130> equivalent<00:06:17.670> to

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:17.940 
mural that's the that's equivalent to

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:20.870 
mural that's the that's equivalent to
the<00:06:18.240> same<00:06:18.540> size<00:06:18.810> as<00:06:19.050> a<00:06:19.080> real<00:06:19.350> horse<00:06:19.620> it's<00:06:20.610> like

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880 
the same size as a real horse it's like

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.720 
the same size as a real horse it's like
uh<00:06:21.000> dodosh<00:06:21.390> eval
