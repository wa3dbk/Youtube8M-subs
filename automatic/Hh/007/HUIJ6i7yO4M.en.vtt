00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
to take a very brief look at the y-wing

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.909 
to take a very brief look at the y-wing
expansion<00:00:06.540> for<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:06.870> Star<00:00:07.230> Wars<00:00:07.470> x-wing

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:07.919 
expansion for the Star Wars x-wing

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.730 
expansion for the Star Wars x-wing
miniatures<00:00:08.250> game<00:00:08.760> now<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.540> yway<00:00:10.050> expansion

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
miniatures game now the yway expansion

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.370 
miniatures game now the yway expansion
is<00:00:10.860> also<00:00:11.250> part<00:00:11.550> of<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.880> wave<00:00:12.120> 1<00:00:12.450> expansion<00:00:13.049> set

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
is also part of the wave 1 expansion set

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.829 
is also part of the wave 1 expansion set
there<00:00:13.889> are<00:00:14.099> a<00:00:14.130> total<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.700> four<00:00:15.000> ships<00:00:15.360> /<00:00:15.599> wave

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there are a total of four ships / wave

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.140 
there are a total of four ships / wave
and<00:00:16.289> right<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:16.949> there<00:00:17.100> are<00:00:17.220> three<00:00:17.250> waves<00:00:17.850> out

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
and right now there are three waves out

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.019 
and right now there are three waves out
on<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.539> market<00:00:18.990> now<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.680> wiring<00:00:20.189> does<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> few

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
on the market now the wiring does a few

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.279 
on the market now the wiring does a few
things<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.570> different<00:00:21.840> than<00:00:22.080> the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
things that are different than the

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.560 
things that are different than the
x-wing<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.100> TIE<00:00:23.340> fighter<00:00:23.730> so<00:00:24.269> let's<00:00:24.449> take

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
x-wing and the TIE fighter so let's take

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.080 
x-wing and the TIE fighter so let's take
a<00:00:24.630> quick<00:00:24.900> moment<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.350> see<00:00:26.099> what<00:00:26.369> it<00:00:26.490> does<00:00:26.699> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
a quick moment to see what it does and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.849 
a quick moment to see what it does and
what<00:00:27.330> kind<00:00:27.539> of<00:00:27.599> pilots<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:28.170> upgrade<00:00:28.500> cards

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
what kind of pilots and upgrade cards

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.339 
what kind of pilots and upgrade cards
come<00:00:29.039> with<00:00:29.070> it<00:00:29.869> for<00:00:30.869> those<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.230> that

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
come with it for those of you that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.780 
come with it for those of you that
aren't<00:00:31.529> really<00:00:31.800> familiar<00:00:31.980> with<00:00:32.250> the<00:00:32.520> Star

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
aren't really familiar with the Star

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.970 
aren't really familiar with the Star
Wars<00:00:32.969> universe<00:00:33.260> basically<00:00:34.260> you're<00:00:34.410> y-wing<00:00:34.950> is

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
Wars universe basically you're y-wing is

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.270 
Wars universe basically you're y-wing is
your<00:00:35.399> bomber<00:00:35.610> class<00:00:36.770> it's<00:00:37.770> not<00:00:38.010> as

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
your bomber class it's not as

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280 
your bomber class it's not as
maneuverable<00:00:38.760> and<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.390> bit<00:00:39.570> more<00:00:39.719> bulky<00:00:40.170> than

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
maneuverable and a bit more bulky than

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.020 
maneuverable and a bit more bulky than
the<00:00:40.410> x-wing<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> little<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.550> slower

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the x-wing so it's a little bit slower

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.900 
the x-wing so it's a little bit slower
in<00:00:42.420> terms<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.960> how<00:00:43.469> it<00:00:43.590> can<00:00:43.739> maneuver<00:00:44.100> but<00:00:44.730> it

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
in terms of how it can maneuver but it

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.670 
in terms of how it can maneuver but it
makes<00:00:45.059> up<00:00:45.329> for<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.780> increased<00:00:46.379> hull

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
makes up for it with increased hull

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.130 
makes up for it with increased hull
strength<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.489> can<00:00:48.149> even<00:00:48.300> equip<00:00:48.719> an<00:00:48.870> eye<00:00:49.110> on

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
strength and can even equip an eye on

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.160 
strength and can even equip an eye on
turret<00:00:49.860> to<00:00:50.430> disable<00:00:51.300> enemies<00:00:51.660> for<00:00:51.899> a<00:00:51.930> short

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
turret to disable enemies for a short

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.900 
turret to disable enemies for a short
period<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.559> time<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.129> I'll<00:00:53.460> go<00:00:53.610> over<00:00:53.670> that<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
period of time and I'll go over that a

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.069 
period of time and I'll go over that a
little<00:00:54.000> bit<00:00:54.149> later<00:00:56.809> alright<00:00:57.809> what<00:00:57.930> you're

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
little bit later alright what you're

00:00:58.079 --> 00:00:59.990 
little bit later alright what you're
looking<00:00:58.320> at<00:00:58.410> here<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.949> y-wings<00:00:59.520> maneuver

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
looking at here is the y-wings maneuver

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.970 
looking at here is the y-wings maneuver
dial<00:01:00.300> I<00:01:00.570> didn't<00:01:00.840> show<00:01:01.050> you<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.350> x-wings<00:01:01.800> where

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
dial I didn't show you the x-wings where

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.500 
dial I didn't show you the x-wings where
the<00:01:02.070> TIE<00:01:02.219> fighters<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.879> previous<00:01:03.149> videos

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
the TIE fighters in the previous videos

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.649 
the TIE fighters in the previous videos
because<00:01:03.899> I<00:01:03.930> basically<00:01:04.199> covered<00:01:04.799> them<00:01:04.979> in<00:01:05.659> the

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
because I basically covered them in the

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.660 
because I basically covered them in the
tutorial<00:01:07.140> video<00:01:07.590> that<00:01:07.799> I<00:01:07.830> made<00:01:07.920> as<00:01:08.369> part<00:01:08.580> of

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tutorial video that I made as part of

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.700 
tutorial video that I made as part of
our<00:01:08.790> regular<00:01:09.060> board<00:01:09.299> game<00:01:09.510> series<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.500> the

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
our regular board game series but the

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.850 
our regular board game series but the
y-wing<00:01:11.310> here<00:01:11.760> has<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.420> ability<00:01:12.840> to<00:01:12.869> go<00:01:13.170> left

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
y-wing here has the ability to go left

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.999 
y-wing here has the ability to go left
straight<00:01:14.610> or<00:01:14.880> right<00:01:15.320> at<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.380> distance<00:01:16.799> of<00:01:16.950> one

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
straight or right at a distance of one

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:25.280 
straight or right at a distance of one
it<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.030> also<00:01:18.240> bank<00:01:18.720> hard<00:01:19.110> on<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:23.570> it<00:01:24.570> can<00:01:24.840> bank

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
it can also bank hard on to it can bank

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.590 
it can also bank hard on to it can bank
card<00:01:25.650> at<00:01:25.920> three<00:01:26.430> however<00:01:26.939> that<00:01:27.180> will<00:01:27.330> cause<00:01:27.570> a

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
card at three however that will cause a

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.969 
card at three however that will cause a
stress<00:01:28.259> token<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.840> finally<00:01:30.840> it<00:01:31.020> can<00:01:31.200> go<00:01:31.380> for

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
stress token and finally it can go for

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.260 
stress token and finally it can go for
straight<00:01:32.310> ahead<00:01:32.430> but<00:01:32.759> that<00:01:32.909> will<00:01:33.030> cause

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
straight ahead but that will cause

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.319 
straight ahead but that will cause
stress<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> it<00:01:34.740> can<00:01:34.920> also<00:01:35.070> do<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> que<00:01:35.820> turn<00:01:36.150> it

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
stress and it can also do a que turn it

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.030 
stress and it can also do a que turn it
for<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:36.900> again<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.380> would<00:01:37.470> also<00:01:37.650> cause

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
for but again that would also cause

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.340 
for but again that would also cause
stress<00:01:38.659> all<00:01:39.659> right<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:39.930> as<00:01:39.990> far<00:01:40.140> as<00:01:40.200> your

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
stress all right now as far as your

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.990 
stress all right now as far as your
pilot<00:01:40.680> cards<00:01:41.009> go<00:01:41.189> you've<00:01:41.340> got<00:01:41.520> a<00:01:41.549> total<00:01:41.790> of

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
pilot cards go you've got a total of

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.819 
pilot cards go you've got a total of
four<00:01:42.180> here<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.479> look<00:01:42.630> at<00:01:42.869> again<00:01:43.500> the<00:01:43.619> base

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
four here to look at again the base

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.590 
four here to look at again the base
stats<00:01:44.189> are<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.490> same<00:01:44.700> across<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.060> board<00:01:45.270> no

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
stats are the same across the board no

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.210 
stats are the same across the board no
matter<00:01:45.659> what<00:01:45.930> pilot<00:01:46.350> you<00:01:46.439> choose<00:01:46.770> you've<00:01:47.040> got

combat phase the ship may attack as

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:06.249 
combat phase the ship may attack as
normal<00:06:04.340> so<00:06:04.490> basically<00:06:05.210> what<00:06:05.360> the<00:06:05.449> ion<00:06:05.840> token

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:06.259 
normal so basically what the ion token

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.499 
normal so basically what the ion token
does<00:06:06.440> it<00:06:06.949> just<00:06:07.219> causes<00:06:07.430> the<00:06:07.729> enemy<00:06:08.090> ship<00:06:08.120> to

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:08.509 
does it just causes the enemy ship to

00:06:08.509 --> 00:06:10.779 
does it just causes the enemy ship to
move<00:06:08.690> forward<00:06:08.990> one<00:06:09.349> space<00:06:09.789> quote-unquote

00:06:10.779 --> 00:06:10.789 
move forward one space quote-unquote

00:06:10.789 --> 00:06:14.050 
move forward one space quote-unquote
space<00:06:11.120> for<00:06:12.080> that<00:06:12.289> next<00:06:12.560> turn<00:06:12.979> and<00:06:13.250> that<00:06:13.880> will

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
space for that next turn and that will

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.850 
space for that next turn and that will
basically<00:06:14.360> allow<00:06:14.690> you<00:06:14.990> to<00:06:15.320> maneuver<00:06:15.680> behind
