00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
a huge amount of fun because this game

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.990 
a huge amount of fun because this game
is<00:00:46.469> so<00:00:46.680> fast<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.010> always<00:00:47.489> finish<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:47.850> in

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
is so fast we always finish this in

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.389 
is so fast we always finish this in
under<00:00:48.120> an<00:00:48.300> hour<00:00:48.420> and<00:00:48.690> we<00:00:48.809> are<00:00:48.840> slow<00:00:49.350> players<00:00:49.770> so

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
under an hour and we are slow players so

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.290 
under an hour and we are slow players so
I<00:00:50.430> mean<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.670> wouldn't<00:00:51.059> think<00:00:51.120> it's

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
I mean I wouldn't think it's

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.459 
I mean I wouldn't think it's
unreasonable<00:00:51.539> for<00:00:51.750> a<00:00:51.870> two-player<00:00:52.170> game<00:00:52.350> to

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
unreasonable for a two-player game to

different<00:02:08.030> configurations<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.450> is<00:02:09.629> for<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
different configurations this is for a

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.780 
different configurations this is for a
two<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.319> four<00:02:10.560> player<00:02:10.800> game<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.610> if<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
two and a four player game but if you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
two and a four player game but if you
build<00:02:11.970> them<00:02:12.180> around<00:02:12.360> the<00:02:12.569> other

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
build them around the other

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:15.979 
build them around the other
-<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.410> can<00:02:13.590> configure<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.130> board<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.970> a<00:02:15.569> five

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
- you can configure the board to a five

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.600 
- you can configure the board to a five
player<00:02:16.290> game<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:16.890> five<00:02:17.069> people<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.340> be<00:02:17.400> plant

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610

or<00:02:17.819> a<00:02:18.000> three-player<00:02:18.480> game<00:02:18.540> I<00:02:18.930> just<00:02:19.290> it's<00:02:19.530> it's

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
or a three-player game I just it's it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.170 
or a three-player game I just it's it's
a<00:02:19.890> little<00:02:19.980> thing<00:02:20.190> but<00:02:20.220> it's<00:02:20.459> just<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:20.880> so

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
a little thing but it's just so so

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.479 
a little thing but it's just so so
clever<00:02:21.480> really<00:02:21.780> really<00:02:22.110> nice<00:02:22.290> how<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.250> works

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
clever really really nice how that works

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:26.059 
clever really really nice how that works
and<00:02:24.709> that's<00:02:25.709> it

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:26.069 
and that's it

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:27.800 
and that's it
that's<00:02:26.250> not<00:02:26.430> your<00:02:26.580> Dom<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:27.030> hope<00:02:27.510> this<00:02:27.599> was

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
that's not your Dom I hope this was

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.229 
that's not your Dom I hope this was
interest<00:02:28.620> to<00:02:28.860> some<00:02:29.040> folks<00:02:29.250> who<00:02:29.580> maybe<00:02:30.150> were

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
interest to some folks who maybe were

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:31.250 
interest to some folks who maybe were
introduced<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.540> a<00:02:30.690> game<00:02:30.810> they<00:02:30.930> haven't<00:02:31.140> tried

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
introduced to a game they haven't tried

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:33.770 
introduced to a game they haven't tried
out<00:02:31.319> before<00:02:31.709> it's<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.610> well<00:02:33.060> worth<00:02:33.300> seeking<00:02:33.540> out

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
out before it's a well worth seeking out

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.449 
out before it's a well worth seeking out
we<00:02:33.989> think<00:02:34.080> it's<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.319> great<00:02:34.680> introduction<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459 
we think it's a great introduction to

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.180 
we think it's a great introduction to
failed<00:02:36.300> games<00:02:36.540> also<00:02:36.959> there's<00:02:37.500> a<00:02:37.560> small

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
failed games also there's a small

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.830 
failed games also there's a small
expansion<00:02:38.700> that<00:02:38.970> adds<00:02:39.150> a<00:02:39.300> bunch<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.630> new

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
expansion that adds a bunch of new

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.790 
expansion that adds a bunch of new
letter<00:02:41.450> cards<00:02:42.450> to<00:02:42.569> the<00:02:42.660> game<00:02:42.810> definitely<00:02:43.380> if

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
letter cards to the game definitely if

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.140 
letter cards to the game definitely if
you're<00:02:43.920> gonna<00:02:44.130> seek<00:02:44.430> out<00:02:44.550> Nostradamus<00:02:44.940> seek

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
you're gonna seek out Nostradamus seek

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.610 
you're gonna seek out Nostradamus seek
this<00:02:45.269> out<00:02:45.420> as<00:02:45.540> well<00:02:45.690> because<00:02:45.780> it<00:02:46.019> adds<00:02:46.170> a<00:02:46.350> lot

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
this out as well because it adds a lot

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.590 
this out as well because it adds a lot
more<00:02:46.680> replayability<00:02:47.489> a<00:02:47.700> lot<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.209> variation

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
more replayability a lot more variation

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.390 
more replayability a lot more variation
you<00:02:49.530> know<00:02:49.590> some<00:02:49.739> of<00:02:49.799> those<00:02:49.890> new<00:02:50.040> cards<00:02:50.310> are

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
you know some of those new cards are

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.559 
you know some of those new cards are
really<00:02:50.670> really<00:02:50.850> cool<00:02:51.060> with<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:51.299> way<00:02:51.420> they

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:51.569 
really really cool with the way they

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.900 
really really cool with the way they
work<00:02:51.780> but<00:02:52.290> beyond<00:02:52.560> that<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:53.040> think<00:02:53.069> I<00:02:53.549> am<00:02:53.700> going

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910
