way up if I poke it the indentation

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.320 
way up if I poke it the indentation
doesn't<00:00:20.310> spring<00:00:20.609> back<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.060> quickly

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
doesn't spring back really quickly

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.870 
doesn't spring back really quickly
that's<00:00:21.600> how<00:00:21.750> I<00:00:21.779> know<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.260> done<00:00:22.560> rising<00:00:23.039> so

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
that's how I know it's done rising so

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.040 
that's how I know it's done rising so
what<00:00:24.029> I'm<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.300> do<00:00:24.480> is<00:00:24.570> I'm<00:00:24.689> gonna<00:00:24.810> turn

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna turn

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.140 
what I'm going to do is I'm gonna turn
it<00:00:25.230> out<00:00:25.380> onto<00:00:25.410> a<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.340> lightly<00:00:26.580> floured

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
it out onto a really lightly floured

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060 
it out onto a really lightly floured
counter<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.109> don't<00:00:28.289> want<00:00:28.410> too<00:00:28.619> much<00:00:28.769> flour

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
counter you don't want too much flour

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.030 
counter you don't want too much flour
because<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.550> want<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:29.970> little<00:00:30.179> bit<00:00:30.420> of

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
because you want a little bit of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.290 
because you want a little bit of
sticking<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.219> board<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.579> creates<00:00:32.850> surface

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
sticking to the board it creates surface

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.450 
sticking to the board it creates surface
tension<00:00:33.750> on<00:00:33.899> your<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:34.770> your<00:00:34.829> bread<00:00:35.100> makes<00:00:35.309> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
tension on your on your bread makes it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.790 
tension on your on your bread makes it
easier<00:00:35.730> for<00:00:35.790> shaping<00:00:36.469> then<00:00:37.469> you're<00:00:37.620> just

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
easier for shaping then you're just

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.459 
easier for shaping then you're just
going<00:00:37.920> to<00:00:37.950> turn<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.760> really<00:00:39.059> gently<00:00:39.390> out<00:00:39.480> you

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
going to turn it really gently out you

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.040 
going to turn it really gently out you
want<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.770> be<00:00:40.860> careful<00:00:41.160> not<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.540> press<00:00:42.540> out<00:00:42.809> all

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
want to be careful not to press out all

want to be careful not to press out all
the<00:00:43.260> gas<00:00:44.210> that's<00:00:45.210> already<00:00:45.570> built<00:00:45.899> up<00:00:46.110> in<00:00:46.320> your

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the gas that's already built up in your

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.540 
the gas that's already built up in your
bread<00:00:46.620> because<00:00:46.890> that's<00:00:47.039> going<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.250> give<00:00:47.399> you<00:00:47.520> a

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
bread because that's going to give you a

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.450 
bread because that's going to give you a
nice<00:00:47.700> air<00:00:48.000> pockets<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.719> your<00:00:48.750> final<00:00:49.739> dough<00:00:49.920> and

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:52.699 
what I like to do is just push it out

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:55.069 
what I like to do is just push it out
with<00:00:53.699> my<00:00:53.850> fingertips<00:00:54.390> into<00:00:54.750> a<00:00:54.780> rough

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
with my fingertips into a rough

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.410 
with my fingertips into a rough
rectangle<00:00:58.039> and<00:01:00.109> then<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> take<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> bottom

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
rectangle and then I take the bottom

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.410 
rectangle and then I take the bottom
third<00:01:03.420> here<00:01:03.870> and<00:01:04.080> I<00:01:04.140> fold<00:01:04.409> it<00:01:04.559> to<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.799> center

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
third here and I fold it to the center

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.340 
third here and I fold it to the center
and<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.810> seam<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.350> down<00:01:07.530> and<00:01:08.810> then<00:01:09.810> I<00:01:09.840> take<00:01:10.170> this

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
and I seam it down and then I take this

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.280 
and I seam it down and then I take this
top<00:01:10.710> third<00:01:11.100> here<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.540> fold<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.020> the

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
top third here and I fold it to the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.490 
top third here and I fold it to the
center<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.820> seam<00:01:15.150> it<00:01:15.299> down<00:01:15.479> again<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.140> what

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
center and I seam it down again and what

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.649 
center and I seam it down again and what
I'm<00:01:16.590> doing<00:01:16.619> here<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.250> I'm<00:01:17.490> creating<00:01:18.000> extra

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
I'm doing here is I'm creating extra

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.450 
I'm doing here is I'm creating extra
structure<00:01:19.229> or<00:01:19.409> what<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.560> call<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.920> backbone<00:01:20.430> of

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
structure or what I call the backbone of

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.270 
structure or what I call the backbone of
the<00:01:20.820> bread<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:22.020> that<00:01:22.049> it<00:01:22.380> rises<00:01:22.830> really<00:01:23.100> nicely

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
the bread so that it rises really nicely

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120 
the bread so that it rises really nicely
in<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> oven<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.270> when<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.380> score<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.040> will

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
in the oven and when you score it will

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.899 
in the oven and when you score it will
open<00:01:26.340> up<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.600> bloom<00:01:28.200> beautifully<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.100> then<00:01:29.790> I

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
open up and bloom beautifully and then I

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.469 
open up and bloom beautifully and then I
take<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.299> whole<00:01:30.600> loaf<00:01:30.930> of<00:01:31.259> bread<00:01:32.329> flip<00:01:33.329> it

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
take the whole loaf of bread flip it

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.100 
take the whole loaf of bread flip it
here<00:01:33.720> and<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:35.549> fold<00:01:35.939> it<00:01:36.090> in<00:01:36.180> half<00:01:36.210> and<00:01:36.750> I'll<00:01:36.960> see

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
here and I fold it in half and I'll see

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.840 
here and I fold it in half and I'll see
either<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.439> heel<00:01:37.829> in<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.040> hand<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.640> can

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
either the heel in your hand or you can

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.230 
either the heel in your hand or you can
go<00:01:39.030> and<00:01:39.210> pinch<00:01:39.990> at<00:01:40.259> it<00:01:40.500> seam<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> all<00:01:41.340> together

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.999 

and<00:01:45.240> now<00:01:45.450> you've<00:01:45.630> got<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> nice<00:01:46.049> little<00:01:46.320> log<00:01:46.649> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
and now you've got a nice little log and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.300 
and now you've got a nice little log and
I'm<00:01:47.670> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.939> use<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.479> Banat<00:01:49.320> on<00:01:49.530> here<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.189> I'm

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
I'm going to use a Banat on here so I'm

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539 
I'm going to use a Banat on here so I'm
gonna<00:01:50.930> make<00:01:51.930> sure<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.170> just<00:01:52.290> it<00:01:52.740> liberally<00:01:53.520> with

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
gonna make sure I just it liberally with

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.310 
gonna make sure I just it liberally with
some<00:01:53.880> rye<00:01:54.060> flour<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:56.509> then<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:57.689> can<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.200> you

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
some rye flour and then you can if you

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
some rye flour and then you can if you
were<00:01:58.439> doing<00:01:58.680> this<00:01:58.829> reform<00:01:59.430> you<00:01:59.939> would<00:02:00.060> just

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
were doing this reform you would just

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.679 
were doing this reform you would just
taper<00:02:00.630> the<00:02:00.899> ends<00:02:02.149> and<00:02:03.149> there<00:02:03.360> you've<00:02:03.479> got<00:02:03.540> a

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
taper the ends and there you've got a
