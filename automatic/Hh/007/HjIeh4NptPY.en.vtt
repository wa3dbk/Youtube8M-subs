00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
but interesting contrast to that is that

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.820

damage the environment and because they

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.230 
damage the environment and because they
come<00:02:04.990> from<00:02:05.140> bamboo<00:02:05.530> bamboo<00:02:05.950> grows<00:02:06.369> quick<00:02:06.670> so

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
come from bamboo bamboo grows quick so

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.199 
come from bamboo bamboo grows quick so
they<00:02:07.270> quickly<00:02:07.540> replaceable<00:02:08.910> here's<00:02:09.910> some<00:02:10.119> of

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.209 
they quickly replaceable here's some of

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:12.630 
they quickly replaceable here's some of
those<00:02:10.560> bamboo<00:02:11.560> screens<00:02:11.950> like<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.310> one<00:02:12.430> that

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.770 
then I use these bamboo boom gates and
you<00:03:31.040> can<00:03:31.189> see<00:03:31.400> over<00:03:31.700> here<00:03:31.730> there's<00:03:32.239> a<00:03:32.329> pipe

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
keep spare ones there to replace them

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.239 
keep spare ones there to replace them
with<00:03:44.599> once<00:03:45.379> again<00:03:45.560> very<00:03:46.190> cheap<00:03:46.459> so<00:03:46.489> easy<00:03:46.879> to<00:03:47.060> do
