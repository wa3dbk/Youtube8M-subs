another quick video on the Builder balls
that<00:00:17.520> you<00:00:17.640> can<00:00:17.760> assemble<00:00:18.000> in<00:00:18.300> buried<00:00:18.840> so<00:00:19.320> here

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
that you can assemble in buried so here

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.160 
that you can assemble in buried so here
goes<00:00:19.890> all<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.670> parts<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.449> need<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.930> assemble

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
goes all the parts you need to assemble

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.730 
goes all the parts you need to assemble
the<00:00:22.380> builders<00:00:22.680> are<00:00:22.980> in<00:00:23.250> the<00:00:23.550> general<00:00:24.029> shop<00:00:24.300> and

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:24.740 
the builders are in the general shop and

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.890 
the builders are in the general shop and
the<00:00:25.880> first<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.090> rules<00:00:27.390> are<00:00:27.510> quickly<00:00:27.689> show

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
the first to be rules are quickly show

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.650 
the first to be rules are quickly show
you<00:00:27.930> are<00:00:28.230> from<00:00:28.800> previous<00:00:29.189> Maps<00:00:29.420> turbine<00:00:30.420> from

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
you are from previous Maps turbine from

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.389 
you are from previous Maps turbine from
transit<00:00:31.140> and<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.619> trample<00:00:31.980> steam<00:00:32.070> from

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
transit and the trample steam from

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.100 
transit and the trample steam from
diaries<00:00:32.610> so<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.360> won't<00:00:33.540> show<00:00:33.690> you<00:00:33.719> the<00:00:33.870> parts

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
diaries so I won't show you the parts

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.799 
diaries so I won't show you the parts
needed<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:35.100> assemble<00:00:35.340> them<00:00:35.640> but<00:00:36.390> for<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> next

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
needed to assemble them but for the next

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:42.020 
needed to assemble them but for the next
buildable<00:00:37.710> is<00:00:38.030> the<00:00:39.739> head<00:00:40.739> chopper<00:00:41.309> which

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
buildable is the head chopper which

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
buildable is the head chopper which
requires<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.809> odd-looking<00:00:43.969> platform

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.280 

what<00:00:50.910> I'm<00:00:51.060> trained<00:00:51.510> as<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.720> would<00:00:51.870> like<00:00:52.080> to<00:00:52.140> give

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
what I'm trained as I would like to give

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.080 
what I'm trained as I would like to give
a<00:00:52.410> little<00:00:52.710> shout<00:00:53.010> out<00:00:53.070> to<00:00:53.370> slap<00:00:53.670> Drake<00:00:53.910> for

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
a little shout out to slap Drake for

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:03.950 
a little shout out to slap Drake for
helping<00:00:54.330> me

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:20.160 

you<00:01:04.960> need<00:01:05.110> the<00:01:05.460> COG<00:01:16.950> you<00:01:17.950> need<00:01:18.130> the<00:01:18.490> blade<00:01:19.170> all

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 
you need the COG you need the blade all

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.570 
you need the COG you need the blade all
these<00:01:20.320> parts<00:01:20.619> are<00:01:20.770> always<00:01:21.100> in<00:01:21.220> the<00:01:21.310> same<00:01:21.520> place

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
these parts are always in the same place

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.760 
these parts are always in the same place
so<00:01:22.330> you<00:01:22.390> should<00:01:22.810> never<00:01:23.020> get<00:01:23.170> lost<00:01:23.410> trying<00:01:23.650> to

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
so you should never get lost trying to

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:38.850 
so you should never get lost trying to
find<00:01:23.860> them<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:35.290> crank<00:01:37.410> well<00:01:38.410> I<00:01:38.440> call<00:01:38.710> it<00:01:38.740> a

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:38.860 
find them and a crank well I call it a

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:40.290 
find them and a crank well I call it a
crank<00:01:39.039> i'm<00:01:39.190> not<00:01:39.310> sure<00:01:39.460> where<00:01:39.580> nails<00:01:39.850> else

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.300 
crank i'm not sure where nails else

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:46.740 
crank i'm not sure where nails else
would<00:01:40.450> call<00:01:40.570> it<00:01:45.060> and<00:01:46.060> then<00:01:46.180> you'll<00:01:46.360> have<00:01:46.509> the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
would call it and then you'll have the

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.969 
would call it and then you'll have the
head<00:01:46.990> chopper<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:51.520> the<00:01:51.729> next<00:01:52.060> buildable<00:01:52.450> the

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
head chopper for the next buildable the

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.859 
head chopper for the next buildable the
subsurface<00:01:54.030> resonator<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.509> need<00:01:55.690> the

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
subsurface resonator you need the

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:05.910 
subsurface resonator you need the
roulette<00:01:56.740> table<00:01:57.610> topper<00:01:57.940> and<00:02:04.740> kind<00:02:05.740> of<00:02:05.830> the

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920 
roulette table topper and kind of the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.280 
roulette table topper and kind of the
bottom<00:02:06.280> to<00:02:06.520> the<00:02:06.660> table<00:02:07.660> toppers<00:02:08.080> still
