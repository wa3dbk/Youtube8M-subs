 doubt that the staff is 100 m 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.140
 record this video just for 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.790
 clarify this for you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.710
 Let's take as an example the city of são 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.430
 Where do you live today? 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
 capital

 how does it work to this issue 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.500
 Address 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 good if you first thing has to 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.800
 understand their activity 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.789
 What is your activity as a provider of 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:52.949
 service is industry is trade because 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.629
 business sector issue is linked 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:58.559
 directly to the complexity that is you 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.120
 open a company in a given 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.989
 Let's talk a little about the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.789
 industry 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:05.460
 today we are paul we have one 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:07.320
 issue of zoning then you 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.780
 need for example same step is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.650
 question in the subprefecture of his 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.909
 region if this industrial activity 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:16.200
 allowed within that zone 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.850
 within that address that you 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.439
 determined to be your company then the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.390
 first step before you search 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 an accountant are you looking for the city hall 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.259
 to see if that activity can 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.090
 be exercised only the activity 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.799
 industry that has an area well 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.450
 restricted to industries 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.040
 In another case, the question of trade 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.810
 you also need to see why you have 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.880
 which is strictly residential 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:37.710
 so you can not put in a 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.619
 trade there already needs an hour 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.570
 least a mixed area where you have 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.119
 trade and residence that you will be able to 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.829
 open your business you need to see this 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.810
 first your first points 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.520
 attention to the issue of provision of 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.740
 services is a bit different because 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.540
 because there are a lot of people 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.950
 a service that does not serve the person in the 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.730
 his own where it is the seat of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.010
 company she leaves 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.600
 of the company's headquarters to provide 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.360
 we find many 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:08.270
 liberal professional engineers 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.040
 doctors is that they do not act 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.630
 directly at your company headquarters 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.340
 either he leaves 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.980
 he is inside a hospital within 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.510
 third clinic's lawyer 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.150
 is suddenly inside a structure of 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.890
 one of another big company and he 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.780
 Are not you going to actually meet there? 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.330
 in this case it has only one point of 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.520
 reference his address is actually 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.560
 only to receive correspondence and to 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:33.230
 people only know the entities 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.030
 federal and state federal 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.130
 his company the reference where 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.080
 people will find this owner of the 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.930
 company was that we talk address 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:44.090
 point of reference you have 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.300
 municipalities that it calls a tax point 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.860
 another from the bottom and finally people 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.050
 has several nomenclatures 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:52.460
 but you can do it on your own 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.590
 residence so if you are a provider 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:58.190
 you are a doctor you are a 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.590
 lawyer you are a psychologist is or is a 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.630
 any software developer 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.900
 provide service in general if you 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:07.400
 does not answer the person at the local hotel in 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.620
 headquarters of your company you go out to 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.750
 answer outside you can open company in 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.160
 your own home address 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.720
 today speaking in the municipality of são paulo 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.790
 You are not obligated to take a license 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.500
 if you enter the website of the 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.930
 City Hall in the finance industry 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.480
 they will pass you to the 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.090
 legal basis that both the company 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:28.640
 does not answer that they do not have 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.800
 Do you have a home office and do not 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.330
 and you do not have employees you are not 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.930
 required to take business license 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.570
 with this you can open your company 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.830
 within their home and their 

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:42.080
 residence 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.910
 What you need to note the following is 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.980
 the trade issue 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:48.320
 if you have a commercial company or 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.600
 mainly you need 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:52.280
 have an address different from yours 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.670
 residence address this happens 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.320
 because there is the fiscal supervision 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.690
 that it is obliged to verify the 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.730
 to keep up with its activity, it has no 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.160
 authorization to enter from is to enter 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:05.740
 in your house 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.930
 In your home address , that's it. 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:10.780
 with a court order then it is 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.140
 prevented from supervising the verification of 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.670
 activity when you have separate there is 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.920

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.570
 residential business address it already 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:22.090

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.820
 inspection and can enter the company 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:26.200
