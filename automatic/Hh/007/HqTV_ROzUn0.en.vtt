00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.350
 Yes It Is Hello is often today 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.610
 I would like to do a dashboard course 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.610
 Let's go to the dashboard 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.750
 If you want to go back 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.750
 You can go back here 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:29.930
 Also after f 4 on the keyboard 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:33.390
 You can go to the dashboard You can return to the desktop by pressing 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.190
 Three people on the trackpad go left 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:40.899
 Go back in to the right 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.680
 Let's take a look at the dashboard It's the initial setting of the dashboard, and only now it's the top 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.630
 There is 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.440
 Calendar clock 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:51.280
 It is contact with the public forecast 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.760
 The widgets placed in the dashboard can be used normally in this way 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.260
 Of course it can be used as a calculator 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:04.000
 Weather forecast 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:04.000
 If you change bash, you can learn how to study here Change the place here 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:12.880
 After clock or double bullet 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:18.659
 It is possible to go back with this by changing the month of the calendar 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:23.110
 You can follow the placements you like by dragging them like this 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.250
 If you want to increase the number of widgets after this + on the lower left 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:30.830
 I can add it 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:35.120
 Let me add some, for example, an address book or a post dictionary 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.170
 Customize your dashboard as you like this 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:42.390
 Please give me 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:46.860
 It will disappear if you press this system if you can not enter 6 ht 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.020
 Husband is added to manage the Wejitto If you want to add a lot of Wejitto 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.170
 Let's go 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.320
 If you press this button 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.290
 I like it here because I go to the site of apple at safari 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:02:01.440
 You can download the page 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:07.770
 So Chaimashou added download Gide their a favorite 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:11.140
 Lastly, let me only lighten the introduction of the widget that I am in the city most 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:15.569
 Go back to the dashboard once again 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.569
 I would like to add a web clip 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:25.860
 It is this of this safari logo 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:26.490
 If you press this now, nothing will appear, but if you set it with Saori, web clip will be loaded 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.270
 I will 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:29.270
 Let's go under the tongue 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:43.400
 For example, let's say you read this topic of Yahoo Japan carefully 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:47.780
 You can transfer this to the dashboard as a web clip 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.610
 If you want to create a web clip, click Open in the file dashboard. 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.530
 I will 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:56.330
 Then, a window like this will appear, so decide the size of the web clip here 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:03:00.980
 Let's chat 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.410
 Well the size of the topic, as I said it'd be good to choose anywhere in the site 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:06.910
 I will 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.720
 You can change it to a free size with a single click with the mouse 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.010
 This time a little 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.060
 I want to show you by putting in the advertisement 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.060
 Because it is seen in the ad 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.270
 Let's will put on the dashboard additional Once you have determined the size 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.600
 Then like this 

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.810
 I will be able to see the topic of Yahoo Japan in real time 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:37.400
 So the ad gets updated like this 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:40.010
 Of course if the topic is something new, this dashboard web 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.629
 It also looks good on the clip 

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:46.910
 It's easy to say, just cut out the website topic and paste it into a dashboard 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:51.110
 It looks like it 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:53.210
 So you can use it as a normal Yahoo Japan site 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.180
 If there is a topic to be worried about 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:04:00.960
 If so, please click on it will go perfectly on the page 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.380
 I wonder if it's a web clip 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:09.210
 Oh, that's how it feels like a dashboard course 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.970
 Now I would like to finish, but effective because the dashboard there is a I so much space 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:12.490
 Let's use it 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.060
 in this way 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.060
 Organize 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:23.070
 Let me give you a lot of favorite upper marks 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:28.100
 In my case with a lot of web clips 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:32.800
 Naturally I try to do it at the same time at various times 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:32.800
 If it is more than is such a feeling goodbye 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.380
 Masu Tei 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.380
