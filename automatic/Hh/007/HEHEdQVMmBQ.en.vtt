anyone else I have an idea what it might
be<00:00:53.430> but<00:00:53.719> what<00:00:54.719> I<00:00:54.750> will<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.170> is<00:00:55.440> count<00:00:56.100> down<00:00:56.629> from

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
be but what I will do is count down from

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.139 
be but what I will do is count down from
all<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.530> things<00:00:58.800> I<00:00:59.129> think<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.910> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
all the things I think it is and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.569 
all the things I think it is and
eliminate<00:01:00.750> them<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.170> when<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.340> the

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
eliminate them and when I get to the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979 
eliminate them and when I get to the
point<00:01:02.850> where<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> can't<00:01:03.510> eliminate<00:01:03.660> the

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
point where I can't eliminate the

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.260 
point where I can't eliminate the
problem<00:01:04.320> then<00:01:04.470> that<00:01:04.619> is<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.949> problem<00:01:05.369> we'll

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
problem then that is the problem we'll

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.910 
problem then that is the problem we'll
go<00:01:06.390> through<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.750> check<00:01:06.960> all<00:01:07.200> these<00:01:07.320> fuses<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
go through and check all these fuses to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.200 
go through and check all these fuses to
make<00:01:08.070> sure<00:01:08.220> they're<00:01:08.369> all<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:08.670> there<00:01:08.880> they're

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
make sure they're all in there they're

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.050 
make sure they're all in there they're
all<00:01:09.299> working<00:01:10.250> Electronics<00:01:11.250> is<00:01:11.369> not<00:01:11.549> my<00:01:11.700> strong

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
all working Electronics is not my strong

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:18.380 
all working Electronics is not my strong
sweet<00:01:12.979> suit<00:01:14.869> Forte<00:01:16.040> but<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.549> take<00:01:18.180> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
sweet suit Forte but I can take a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.020 
sweet suit Forte but I can take a
voltmeter<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.320> check<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.189> for<00:01:20.400> continuity

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
voltmeter and check it for continuity

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.330 
voltmeter and check it for continuity
which<00:01:21.270> means<00:01:22.040> does<00:01:23.040> this<00:01:23.369> fuse<00:01:24.920> will<00:01:25.920> power<00:01:26.130> go

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
which means does this fuse will power go

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.560 
which means does this fuse will power go
through<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:26.670> or<00:01:26.939> is<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.180> broken

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
through it or is it broken

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.410 
through it or is it broken
is<00:01:27.659> there<00:01:28.140> any<00:01:28.290> broken<00:01:28.590> problems<00:01:29.189> then<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> will

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
is there any broken problems then I will

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.780 
is there any broken problems then I will
go<00:01:30.570> through<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.079> check<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.829> rectifier<00:01:32.490> I

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
go through and check the rectifier I

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.469 
go through and check the rectifier I
hope<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.490> this<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.640> for<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.850> customer<00:01:36.210> I<00:01:36.240> hope

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
hope it this is for the customer I hope

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.569 
hope it this is for the customer I hope
it's<00:01:36.630> not<00:01:36.750> the<00:01:36.869> rectifier<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:39.000> rectifier<00:01:39.659> is

blows up what it will do is it will

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.420 
blows up what it will do is it will
throw<00:02:23.020> shrapnel<00:02:23.739> an<00:02:25.319> acid<00:02:26.319> into<00:02:27.069> whatever's
