it<00:01:50.369> has<00:01:50.399> this<00:01:50.869> locking<00:01:51.869> mechanism<00:01:52.439> which<00:01:52.950> lets

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
it has this locking mechanism which lets

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.420 
it has this locking mechanism which lets
you<00:01:53.430> unscrew<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.570> legs<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.229> you<00:01:55.979> can<00:01:56.130> extend

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
you unscrew the legs and you can extend

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.499 
you unscrew the legs and you can extend
them<00:01:56.659> all<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.930> way<00:01:58.020> to<00:01:58.079> one<00:01:58.350> meter

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:02.509 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:06.190 

I'll<00:02:03.140> show<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.439> to<00:02:03.530> your<00:02:03.710> way<00:02:03.890> now<00:02:04.189> so<00:02:05.200> you

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
I'll show them to your way now so you

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.009 
I'll show them to your way now so you
can<00:02:06.350> get<00:02:06.439> a<00:02:06.500> better<00:02:06.740> idea<00:02:06.890> of<00:02:07.219> how<00:02:07.579> tall<00:02:08.060> this

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:09.019 
can get a better idea of how tall this

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.229 
can get a better idea of how tall this
tripod<00:02:09.670> actually<00:02:10.670> gets<00:02:12.489> it's<00:02:13.489> very<00:02:13.700> light<00:02:13.970> so

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:14.239 
tripod actually gets it's very light so

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:16.930 
tripod actually gets it's very light so
it's<00:02:14.840> definitely<00:02:15.260> easy<00:02:16.069> to<00:02:16.280> hold<00:02:16.400> it<00:02:16.580> with<00:02:16.730> one

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
it's definitely easy to hold it with one

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.920
