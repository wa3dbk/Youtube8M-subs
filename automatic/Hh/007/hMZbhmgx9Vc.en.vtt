you how exciting biology can truly be
now<00:00:33.090> let's<00:00:33.360> get<00:00:33.660> to<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.430> what<00:00:35.430> is

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
now let's get to it what is

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.540 
now let's get to it what is
osmoregulation<00:00:38.329> many<00:00:39.329> people<00:00:39.750> including

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
osmoregulation many people including

osmoregulation many people including
everyone<00:00:41.550> in<00:00:41.790> this<00:00:41.940> room<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.540> have<00:00:43.140> no<00:00:43.590> idea

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
everyone in this room I have no idea

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.479 
everyone in this room I have no idea
what<00:00:44.309> was<00:00:44.340> no<00:00:44.670> regulation<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:46.100> therefore<00:00:47.100> we

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
what was no regulation is therefore we

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.240 
what was no regulation is therefore we
are<00:00:47.520> going<00:00:47.879> to<00:00:47.969> try<00:00:48.149> and<00:00:48.239> teach<00:00:48.719> ourselves

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
are going to try and teach ourselves

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.959 
are going to try and teach ourselves
while<00:00:50.250> teaching<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.350> apparently

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
while teaching you apparently

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:55.639 
while teaching you apparently
osmoregulation<00:00:53.989> has<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.140> do<00:00:55.320> with<00:00:55.530> the

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
osmoregulation has to do with the

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.639 
osmoregulation has to do with the
balancing<00:00:56.250> of<00:00:56.399> water<00:00:56.850> uptake<00:00:57.289> with<00:00:58.289> water

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
balancing of water uptake with water

I'll<00:01:10.229> talking<00:01:10.710> about<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.700> have<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
I'll talking about you have to

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.920 
I'll talking about you have to
understand<00:01:12.869> what<00:01:13.590> osmotic<00:01:14.430> pressure<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.479> and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
understand what osmotic pressure is and

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.310 
understand what osmotic pressure is and
in<00:01:16.380> general<00:01:16.650> how<00:01:17.430> sales<00:01:18.000> are<00:01:18.299> able<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.900> absorb

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
in general how sales are able to absorb

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
in general how sales are able to absorb
and<00:01:19.650> release<00:01:20.040> water<00:01:20.600> respectively<00:01:23.540> osmotic

and release water respectively osmotic

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.460 
and release water respectively osmotic
pressure<00:01:24.810> is<00:01:25.530> defined<00:01:25.950> by<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:27.270> pleasure<00:01:27.750> that

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
pressure is defined by the pleasure that

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.240 
pressure is defined by the pleasure that
has<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.950> be<00:01:28.979> applied<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:30.509> a<00:01:30.540> solution<00:01:31.049> in<00:01:31.500> order

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.770 
has to be applied to a solution in order
to<00:01:32.970> prevent<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.960> flow<00:01:34.200> of<00:01:34.470> what<00:01:34.829> L<00:01:35.070> inwardly

to prevent the flow of what L inwardly

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.700 
to prevent the flow of what L inwardly
across<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:37.020> semipermeable<00:01:38.210> membrane<00:01:39.710> doesn't

that<00:01:40.920> just<00:01:40.979> sound<00:01:41.430> exciting<00:01:42.060> no<00:01:42.960> I<00:01:43.259> shall

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
that just sound exciting no I shall

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.240 
that just sound exciting no I shall
think<00:01:44.220> so<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.630> all<00:01:45.840> done<00:01:46.170> to<00:01:46.649> maintain

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
think so this is all done to maintain

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.440 
think so this is all done to maintain
homeostasis<00:01:48.500> on<00:01:49.500> your<00:01:50.070> stasis<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.909> the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
homeostasis on your stasis is the

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.800 
homeostasis on your stasis is the
equilibrium<00:01:52.290> the<00:01:53.070> cells<00:01:53.490> had<00:01:53.939> to<00:01:54.509> have

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
equilibrium the cells had to have

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.149 
equilibrium the cells had to have
between<00:01:55.740> water<00:01:56.280> outside<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:57.329> the<00:01:57.479> cell<00:01:57.689> and

we<00:02:05.640> are<00:02:05.820> required<00:02:06.420> by<00:02:06.720> our<00:02:06.750> sponsors<00:02:07.650> to<00:02:07.920> say

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
we are required by our sponsors to say

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.760 
we are required by our sponsors to say
that<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:09.030> is<00:02:09.210> important<00:02:09.869> in<00:02:10.050> more<00:02:10.530> ways<00:02:10.740> than

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
too much water then the cell will

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.480 
too much water then the cell will
eventually<00:02:21.450> burst<00:02:21.750> from<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.710> pressure<00:02:23.160> of

eventually burst from the pressure of

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.850 
eventually burst from the pressure of
the<00:02:23.520> water<00:02:23.850> on<00:02:24.240> the<00:02:24.360> cell<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.990> both<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:25.530> cell

the water on the cell and both the cell

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.630 
the water on the cell and both the cell
and<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.400> organism<00:02:27.180> will<00:02:27.570> die<00:02:27.980> the<00:02:28.980> same<00:02:29.280> goes

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
and the organism will die the same goes

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.070 
and the organism will die the same goes
for<00:02:30.420> lack<00:02:30.660> of<00:02:30.690> water<00:02:31.610> without<00:02:32.610> water<00:02:33.000> the<00:02:33.510> cell

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
for lack of water without water the cell

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.220 
for lack of water without water the cell
will<00:02:34.350> shrivel<00:02:34.710> up<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.850> organism<00:02:36.660> along

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
will shrivel up and the organism along

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.800 
will shrivel up and the organism along
with<00:02:37.260> the<00:02:37.710> cell<00:02:38.040> will<00:02:38.940> die<00:02:40.100> therefore<00:02:41.100> without

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
with the cell will die therefore without

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:45.470 
with the cell will die therefore without
osmoregulation<00:02:43.430> there<00:02:44.430> would<00:02:44.640> not<00:02:44.880> be<00:02:45.150> any

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
osmoregulation there would not be any
