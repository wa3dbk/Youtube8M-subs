00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
for passengers because the whole idea

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:11.720 
and once the record had been completed

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.720 
and once the record had been completed
that's<00:01:12.720> when<00:01:13.050> the<00:01:13.140> emotion<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:14.490> ready<00:01:14.670> to

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:14.730 
that's when the emotion that ready to

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.480 
that's when the emotion that ready to
set<00:01:14.970> in<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.650> basically<00:01:16.650> we'd<00:01:16.890> been<00:01:17.160> all

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
set in because basically we'd been all

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.490 
set in because basically we'd been all
working<00:01:18.000> together<00:01:18.120> for<00:01:18.510> so<00:01:18.870> long<00:01:18.900> this

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
working together for so long this

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.500 
working together for so long this
project<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.430> then<00:01:20.760> suddenly<00:01:21.000> we've<00:01:21.300> got<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 
project and then suddenly we've got the

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.970 
project and then suddenly we've got the
world<00:01:21.660> record<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.200> it<00:01:22.260> was<00:01:22.380> over<00:01:22.620> there's<00:01:22.860> no

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
world record and it was over there's no

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.920 
world record and it was over there's no
reason<00:01:23.550> to<00:01:23.580> hold<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.030> organization<00:01:24.660> together

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
reason to hold the organization together

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.320 
reason to hold the organization together
anymore<00:01:25.170> who's<00:01:25.620> ever<00:01:25.830> ready<00:01:26.580> all<00:01:26.970> we<00:01:27.120> could<00:01:27.240> do

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
anymore who's ever ready all we could do

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.890 
anymore who's ever ready all we could do
is<00:01:27.420> celebrate<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.170> go<00:01:28.380> home<00:01:29.540> the<00:01:30.540> only<00:01:30.720> thing

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
is celebrate and go home the only thing

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.110 
is celebrate and go home the only thing
to<00:01:30.930> be<00:01:31.830> concerned<00:01:32.280> about<00:01:32.400> is<00:01:32.730> first<00:01:33.000> of<00:01:33.090> all

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:33.120 
to be concerned about is first of all

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.210 
to be concerned about is first of all
the<00:01:33.270> acceleration<00:01:33.930> which<00:01:34.080> is<00:01:34.110> terrific<00:01:34.440> bit

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
the acceleration which is terrific bit

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.620 
the acceleration which is terrific bit
like<00:01:35.400> an<00:01:35.520> airplane<00:01:35.820> taking<00:01:35.940> off<00:01:36.240> down<00:01:36.510> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
like an airplane taking off down the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.860 
like an airplane taking off down the
runway<00:01:36.750> but<00:01:37.020> much<00:01:38.010> much<00:01:38.250> faster<00:01:38.460> and<00:01:39.000> then

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:39.870 
runway but much much faster and then

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.920 
runway but much much faster and then
when<00:01:40.860> you<00:01:40.950> start<00:01:41.250> going<00:01:41.430> super<00:01:41.760> super<00:01:42.660> sonic

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
when you start going super super sonic

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.690 
when you start going super super sonic
me<00:01:43.050> up<00:01:43.170> like<00:01:43.350> a<00:01:43.410> supersonic<00:01:43.980> over<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.400> intake

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
me up like a supersonic over the intake

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.430 
me up like a supersonic over the intake
start<00:01:45.300> seeing<00:01:45.510> the<00:01:45.570> shockwaves<00:01:45.990> build<00:01:46.260> out

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
start seeing the shockwaves build out

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.230 
start seeing the shockwaves build out
and<00:01:47.040> then<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.370> come<00:01:47.550> out<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:47.940> measured

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
and then you come out to the measured

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.730 
and then you come out to the measured
mile<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.780> you've<00:01:48.990> got<00:01:49.140> to<00:01:49.230> go<00:01:49.350> into<00:01:49.590> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
mile and you've got to go into the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.160 
mile and you've got to go into the
acceleration<00:01:50.640> phase<00:01:50.850> we<00:01:51.540> get<00:01:51.660> a<00:01:51.690> huge

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
acceleration phase we get a huge

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.470 
acceleration phase we get a huge
deceleration<00:01:52.980> spike<00:01:53.280> of<00:01:53.490> 6<00:01:53.760> B<00:01:53.970> which<00:01:54.240> means

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:54.480 
deceleration spike of 6 B which means

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.300 
deceleration spike of 6 B which means
you're<00:01:54.690> losing<00:01:54.840> speed<00:01:55.290> at<00:01:55.800> a<00:01:55.860> hundred<00:01:56.070> and

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
you're losing speed at a hundred and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.920 
you're losing speed at a hundred and
thirty-odd<00:01:56.610> miles<00:01:56.910> an<00:01:57.060> hour<00:01:57.180> seconds<00:01:57.780> so

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
thirty-odd miles an hour seconds so

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.070 
thirty-odd miles an hour seconds so
violent<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:58.800> deceleration<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.690> upsets

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
violent and deceleration and it upsets

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.380 
violent and deceleration and it upsets
your<00:02:01.260> inner<00:02:01.560> ears<00:02:01.890> so<00:02:02.580> you<00:02:02.610> can<00:02:02.850> affect<00:02:03.150> called

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
your inner ears so you can affect called

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.870 
your inner ears so you can affect called
a<00:02:03.510> somato<00:02:03.900> graphic<00:02:04.530> illusion<00:02:05.010> and<00:02:05.580> the<00:02:05.610> effect

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
a somato graphic illusion and the effect

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.670 
a somato graphic illusion and the effect
of<00:02:06.030> that<00:02:06.120> is<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.390> make<00:02:06.720> you<00:02:07.020> feel<00:02:07.350> that<00:02:07.530> you're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
of that is to make you feel that you're

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.470 
of that is to make you feel that you're
driving<00:02:07.860> straight<00:02:08.310> down<00:02:08.490> the<00:02:09.030> center<00:02:09.179> of<00:02:09.330> the

literally<00:02:14.489> 400<00:02:14.940> miles<00:02:15.090> an<00:02:15.270> hour<00:02:15.390> them<00:02:16.040> you've

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
literally 400 miles an hour them you've

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.060 
literally 400 miles an hour them you've
got<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> fight<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> British<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:20.040> British

go it's time the country did something

go it's time the country did something
something<00:02:35.190> rather<00:02:35.370> good<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.940> know<00:02:36.000> in

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
something rather good you know in

something rather good you know in
engineering<00:02:36.630> it<00:02:37.110> was<00:02:37.260> a<00:02:37.290> bit<00:02:37.440> like<00:02:37.560> blood

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709
