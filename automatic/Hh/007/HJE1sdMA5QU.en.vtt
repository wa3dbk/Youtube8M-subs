when<00:00:00.570> it<00:00:00.659> comes<00:00:00.870> to<00:00:01.020> image<00:00:01.350> storage<00:00:01.650> solutions

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
when it comes to image storage solutions

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:03.860 
when it comes to image storage solutions
we've<00:00:02.399> used<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.760> lot<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.149> options<00:00:03.540> out<00:00:03.659> there

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
we've used a lot of options out there

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.050 
we've used a lot of options out there
and<00:00:04.080> we<00:00:04.140> find<00:00:04.380> that<00:00:04.410> there's<00:00:04.620> basically<00:00:04.890> three

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
and we find that there's basically three

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.120 
and we find that there's basically three
brands<00:00:06.060> that<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:06.779> highly<00:00:07.140> recommend<00:00:07.170> one<00:00:07.980> is

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
brands that we highly recommend one is

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.879 
brands that we highly recommend one is
Drobo<00:00:08.550> one<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> g-force<00:00:09.900> and<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.440> last<00:00:10.620> is

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
Drobo one is g-force and the last is

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.009 
Drobo one is g-force and the last is
Synology<00:00:11.490> now<00:00:12.150> all<00:00:12.330> three<00:00:12.570> of<00:00:12.630> these<00:00:12.690> comes<00:00:12.900> to

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
Synology now all three of these comes to

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.749 
Synology now all three of these comes to
make<00:00:13.170> great<00:00:13.500> products<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.190> each<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.639> them

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
make great products and each of them

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.210 
make great products and each of them
vary<00:00:15.210> in<00:00:15.450> very<00:00:15.750> different<00:00:15.929> ways<00:00:16.080> which<00:00:17.010> means

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
vary in very different ways which means

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.470 
vary in very different ways which means
that<00:00:17.369> they<00:00:17.430> all<00:00:17.520> have<00:00:17.699> their<00:00:17.850> pros<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.420> they

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
that they all have their pros and they

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.330 
that they all have their pros and they
have<00:00:18.630> their<00:00:18.779> cons<00:00:19.109> we're<00:00:19.949> gonna<00:00:20.039> kind<00:00:20.279> of

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
have their cons we're gonna kind of

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.470 
have their cons we're gonna kind of
teach<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.699> about<00:00:20.789> each<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> these<00:00:21.240> in<00:00:21.390> this

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.790 
teach you about each of these in this
video<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:22.020> we're<00:00:22.109> gonna<00:00:22.199> let<00:00:22.439> you<00:00:22.470> guys

video and we're gonna let you guys

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.920 
video and we're gonna let you guys
decide<00:00:23.189> on<00:00:23.430> which<00:00:23.730> basically<00:00:24.269> system<00:00:24.840> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
decide on which basically system is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.630 
decide on which basically system is
gonna<00:00:25.109> work<00:00:25.320> best<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.740> your<00:00:26.010> workflow<00:00:26.430> and

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
gonna work best for your workflow and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.179 
gonna work best for your workflow and
for<00:00:26.880> your<00:00:27.090> preferences<00:00:27.900> now<00:00:28.590> all<00:00:28.830> three<00:00:29.099> of

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
for your preferences now all three of

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:30.769 
for your preferences now all three of
these<00:00:29.250> brands<00:00:29.640> create<00:00:29.910> devices<00:00:30.179> that<00:00:30.599> support

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
these brands create devices that support

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.709 
these brands create devices that support
raid<00:00:31.380> 1<00:00:31.710> which<00:00:32.399> is<00:00:32.610> a<00:00:32.640> redundant<00:00:33.329> rate<00:00:33.510> and

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
raid 1 which is a redundant rate and

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.060 
raid 1 which is a redundant rate and
basically<00:00:33.960> what<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.170> means<00:00:34.590> is<00:00:34.829> that<00:00:34.860> you

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
basically what that means is that you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
basically what that means is that you
have<00:00:35.280> multiple<00:00:35.730> hard<00:00:35.969> drives<00:00:36.030> inside<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.719> each

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
have multiple hard drives inside of each

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
have multiple hard drives inside of each
device<00:00:37.290> and<00:00:37.590> when<00:00:38.219> you<00:00:38.280> choose<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.640> correct

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
device and when you choose the correct

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.430 
device and when you choose the correct
options<00:00:39.270> what<00:00:39.420> its<00:00:39.510> gonna<00:00:39.600> do<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.989> gonna<00:00:40.079> use

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
options what its gonna do is gonna use

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.440 
options what its gonna do is gonna use
those<00:00:40.620> additional<00:00:41.190> hard<00:00:41.460> drives<00:00:41.790> to

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
those additional hard drives to

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.840 
those additional hard drives to
basically<00:00:42.780> backup<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.620> data<00:00:43.860> that<00:00:44.579> way<00:00:44.730> if

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
basically backup your data that way if

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.850 
basically backup your data that way if
one<00:00:45.000> hard<00:00:45.270> drive<00:00:45.360> goes<00:00:45.629> out<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:46.320> still<00:00:46.620> have

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
one hard drive goes out you still have

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.279 
one hard drive goes out you still have
the<00:00:47.039> rest<00:00:47.219> of<00:00:47.340> your<00:00:47.430> images<00:00:47.789> intact<00:00:48.360> the<00:00:49.020> drive

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the rest of your images intact the drive

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:50.779 
the rest of your images intact the drive
will<00:00:49.469> tell<00:00:49.710> you<00:00:49.860> that<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> hard<00:00:50.250> drive<00:00:50.430> went<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
will tell you that a hard drive went out

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:51.979 
will tell you that a hard drive went out
and<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.210> need<00:00:51.360> to<00:00:51.480> replace<00:00:51.750> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and that you need to replace it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
and that you need to replace it
immediately<00:00:52.160> that<00:00:53.160> way<00:00:53.309> if<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> lose<00:00:53.640> another

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
immediately that way if you lose another

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.400 
immediately that way if you lose another
drive<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.360> don't<00:00:54.539> actually<00:00:54.719> lose<00:00:55.050> your<00:00:55.110> data

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
drive you don't actually lose your data

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:56.990 
drive you don't actually lose your data
but<00:00:55.770> some<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.010> these<00:00:56.100> drives<00:00:56.399> can<00:00:56.579> actually

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
but some of these drives can actually

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.060 
but some of these drives can actually
withstand<00:00:57.629> basically<00:00:58.260> one<00:00:58.620> two<00:00:58.890> or<00:00:59.039> even

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
withstand basically one two or even

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.400 
withstand basically one two or even
three<00:00:59.280> drives<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.329> out<00:01:00.510> before<00:01:01.289> your

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
three drives going out before your

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.470 
three drives going out before your
images<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:01.890> lost<00:01:02.160> now<00:01:02.789> I<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:02.940> to<00:01:03.000> briefly<00:01:03.300> go

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
images are lost now I want to briefly go

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.359 
images are lost now I want to briefly go

the actual software itself to the actual
unit<00:01:23.340> itself<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.820> all<00:01:23.970> very<00:01:24.330> well<00:01:24.540> designed

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
unit itself it's all very well designed

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.980 
unit itself it's all very well designed
and<00:01:25.080> very<00:01:25.170> simple<00:01:25.920> now<00:01:26.759> Drobo<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.390> known<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.869> be

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
and very simple now Drobo is known to be

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.450 
and very simple now Drobo is known to be
a<00:01:28.020> little<00:01:28.350> bit<00:01:28.500> slower<00:01:28.890> than<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.280> other

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
a little bit slower than the other

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.640 
a little bit slower than the other
devices<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.210> I<00:01:30.270> would<00:01:30.420> watch<00:01:30.720> out<00:01:30.990> for

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
devices and I would watch out for

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.289 
devices and I would watch out for
basically<00:01:31.920> older<00:01:32.400> durable<00:01:32.700> units<00:01:32.939> that<00:01:33.090> may

basically older durable units that may

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.289 
basically older durable units that may
not<00:01:33.509> support<00:01:34.100> faster<00:01:35.100> interfaces<00:01:35.759> such<00:01:36.150> as

not support faster interfaces such as
USB<00:01:36.570> 3<00:01:37.049> or<00:01:37.259> eSATA<00:01:37.909> so<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.450> new<00:01:39.750> drives<00:01:40.079> and

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
USB 3 or eSATA so get new drives and

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.499 
USB 3 or eSATA so get new drives and
even<00:01:40.650> then<00:01:40.890> Drobo<00:01:41.400> still<00:01:41.790> suffers<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> little

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
even then Drobo still suffers a little

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:43.880 
even then Drobo still suffers a little
bit<00:01:42.600> from<00:01:42.840> performance<00:01:43.380> issues<00:01:43.680> when

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
bit from performance issues when

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.160 
bit from performance issues when
compared<00:01:44.340> to<00:01:44.430> something<00:01:44.909> like<00:01:45.060> GeForce<00:01:45.899> or

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
compared to something like GeForce or

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.350 
compared to something like GeForce or
Synology<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.579> you're<00:01:47.700> kind<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:47.909> trading<00:01:48.270> off

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
Synology so you're kind of trading off

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:49.999 
Synology so you're kind of trading off
basically<00:01:48.720> ease-of-use<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.619> simplicity

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
basically ease-of-use and simplicity

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.649 
basically ease-of-use and simplicity
something<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.790> looks<00:01:50.970> nice<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.450> it's<00:01:51.540> kind

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
something that looks nice and it's kind

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.380 
something that looks nice and it's kind
of<00:01:51.720> polished<00:01:52.170> for<00:01:53.009> that<00:01:53.250> slight<00:01:54.000> lack<00:01:54.210> of

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
of polished for that slight lack of

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.760 
of polished for that slight lack of
performance<00:01:54.899> that<00:01:55.110> those<00:01:55.229> other<00:01:55.409> drives

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
performance that those other drives

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
performance that those other drives
offer<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:56.790> still<00:01:57.000> it's<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.299> great<00:01:57.630> solution

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
offer but still it's a great solution

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.679 
offer but still it's a great solution
and<00:01:58.259> it's<00:01:58.350> very<00:01:58.619> simple<00:01:59.100> and<00:01:59.250> easy<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.549> use<00:01:59.820> now

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
and it's very simple and easy to use now

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.780 
and it's very simple and easy to use now
moving<00:02:00.990> on<00:02:01.110> we<00:02:01.290> have<00:02:01.469> GeForce<00:02:02.070> now<00:02:02.280> GeForce<00:02:02.670> is

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
moving on we have GeForce now GeForce is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.700 
moving on we have GeForce now GeForce is
actually<00:02:03.119> very<00:02:03.360> well<00:02:03.630> known<00:02:03.840> in<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> film<00:02:04.469> and

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
actually very well known in the film and

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.980 
actually very well known in the film and
videography<00:02:05.579> industry<00:02:05.939> because<00:02:06.240> these

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
videography industry because these

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
performance now there are a little bit

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.710

more reliability issues and that kind of

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
Lightroom catalog directly from those

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:24.380 
Lightroom catalog directly from those
drives<00:03:22.530> so<00:03:23.310> this<00:03:23.459> is<00:03:23.640> an<00:03:23.760> important<00:03:24.209> feature

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:24.390 
drives so this is an important feature

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.880 
drives so this is an important feature
that<00:03:24.510> you<00:03:24.720> need<00:03:24.870> to<00:03:24.930> decide<00:03:25.230> whether<00:03:25.620> or<00:03:25.800> not

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
that you need to decide whether or not

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.680 
that you need to decide whether or not
is<00:03:26.040> important<00:03:26.519> inside<00:03:26.850> of<00:03:26.940> your<00:03:27.060> workflow<00:03:27.420> and

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:27.690 
is important inside of your workflow and

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:29.600 
is important inside of your workflow and
in<00:03:27.780> your<00:03:27.959> studio<00:03:28.440> now<00:03:29.070> for<00:03:29.280> us<00:03:29.370> it's<00:03:29.550> very

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
in your studio now for us it's very

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.550 
in your studio now for us it's very
important<00:03:30.209> we<00:03:30.360> actually<00:03:30.720> have<00:03:30.900> six<00:03:31.320> different

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
important we actually have six different

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.890 
important we actually have six different
post-production<00:03:32.340> workstations<00:03:33.030> all<00:03:33.330> of

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
post-production workstations all of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.140 
post-production workstations all of
which<00:03:34.080> need<00:03:34.110> access<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:35.130> those<00:03:35.220> images<00:03:35.730> and<00:03:35.940> so

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
which need access to those images and so

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.580 
which need access to those images and so
the<00:03:36.570> Synology<00:03:37.019> is<00:03:37.140> basically<00:03:37.380> the<00:03:37.530> only

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
the Synology is basically the only

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.250 
the Synology is basically the only
option<00:03:38.190> for<00:03:38.220> us<00:03:38.459> because<00:03:39.000> it<00:03:39.510> allows<00:03:39.570> every

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
option for us because it allows every

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.020 
option for us because it allows every
machine<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.890> have<00:03:41.070> an<00:03:41.220> equally<00:03:41.670> fast

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
machine to have an equally fast

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.270 
machine to have an equally fast
connection<00:03:42.600> through<00:03:43.320> the<00:03:43.530> network<00:03:43.830> interface

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
connection through the network interface

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.789 
connection through the network interface
so<00:03:44.940> every<00:03:45.150> machine<00:03:45.299> has<00:03:45.450> a<00:03:45.630> 1,000<00:03:46.410> megabit

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
so every machine has a 1,000 megabit

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.190 
so every machine has a 1,000 megabit
connection<00:03:46.830> to<00:03:47.640> that<00:03:47.790> señal<00:03:48.120> D<00:03:48.239> Drive<00:03:48.540> the

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
connection to that señal D Drive the

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.110 
connection to that señal D Drive the
Synology<00:03:49.680> acts<00:03:49.860> more<00:03:50.160> like<00:03:50.220> a<00:03:50.370> server<00:03:50.760> in<00:03:51.060> that

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
Synology acts more like a server in that

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.940 
Synology acts more like a server in that
basically<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.750> has<00:03:51.870> an<00:03:52.049> internal<00:03:52.380> computing

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
basically it has an internal computing

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.340 
basically it has an internal computing
system<00:03:53.459> basically<00:03:53.760> so<00:03:54.030> anybody<00:03:54.780> can<00:03:55.080> pull

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
system basically so anybody can pull

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:56.780 
system basically so anybody can pull
things<00:03:55.530> directly<00:03:56.070> from<00:03:56.160> this<00:03:56.340> analogy<00:03:56.610> and

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
things directly from this analogy and

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.070 
things directly from this analogy and
it's<00:03:56.880> not<00:03:57.060> going<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.299> slow<00:03:57.540> down<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.959> going

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
it's not going to slow down it's going

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.170 
it's not going to slow down it's going
to<00:03:58.140> serve<00:03:58.320> files<00:03:58.680> equally<00:03:59.280> across<00:03:59.580> the<00:03:59.700> board

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
to serve files equally across the board

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.289 
to serve files equally across the board
to<00:04:00.510> all<00:04:00.630> those<00:04:00.780> workstations<00:04:01.440> but<00:04:02.060> that<00:04:03.060> comes

00:04:03.289 --> 00:04:03.299 
to all those workstations but that comes

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:05.120 
to all those workstations but that comes
at<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> cost<00:04:03.630> we<00:04:03.959> can't<00:04:04.230> open<00:04:04.380> Lightroom<00:04:04.920> files

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
at a cost we can't open Lightroom files

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.030 
at a cost we can't open Lightroom files
directly<00:04:05.610> from<00:04:05.880> the<00:04:06.209> server<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.860> there's

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
directly from the server but there's

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.590 
directly from the server but there's
also<00:04:08.160> benefits<00:04:08.700> on<00:04:08.880> the<00:04:09.090> other<00:04:09.209> side<00:04:09.420> as<00:04:09.570> well

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
also benefits on the other side as well

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.140 
also benefits on the other side as well
as<00:04:10.320> a<00:04:10.380> Synology<00:04:11.340> unit<00:04:11.610> acts<00:04:11.760> more<00:04:11.970> like<00:04:12.060> a

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
as a Synology unit acts more like a

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.910 
as a Synology unit acts more like a
server<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.630> can<00:04:12.750> actually<00:04:12.900> control<00:04:13.470> user

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
server you can actually control user

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.219 
server you can actually control user
access<00:04:14.269> so<00:04:15.269> let's<00:04:15.450> say<00:04:15.570> there's<00:04:15.780> an<00:04:15.840> important

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
access so let's say there's an important

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:17.360 
access so let's say there's an important
company<00:04:16.620> files<00:04:16.859> that<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.100> don't<00:04:17.250> want

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
company files that you don't want

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.800 
company files that you don't want
certain<00:04:17.580> people<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.910> see<00:04:18.060> well<00:04:18.299> you<00:04:18.390> can<00:04:18.540> set

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
certain people to see well you can set

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.349 
certain people to see well you can set
up<00:04:18.930> folders<00:04:19.440> where<00:04:20.190> only<00:04:20.400> certain<00:04:20.820> people<00:04:21.150> can

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
up folders where only certain people can

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.820 
up folders where only certain people can
see<00:04:21.750> those<00:04:21.900> and<00:04:21.930> they're<00:04:22.229> going<00:04:22.349> to<00:04:22.410> access<00:04:22.800> it

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
see those and they're going to access it

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.190 
see those and they're going to access it
through<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.130> username<00:04:23.640> and<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:24.000> password<00:04:24.200> you

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
through a username and a password you

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.480 
through a username and a password you
can<00:04:25.320> set<00:04:25.530> up<00:04:25.620> certain<00:04:25.770> folders<00:04:26.099> like<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.340> our

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
can set up certain folders like in our

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.050 
can set up certain folders like in our
studio<00:04:26.819> for<00:04:27.210> video<00:04:27.569> and<00:04:27.900> for<00:04:28.229> stills<00:04:29.039> so<00:04:29.880> we

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:30.060 
studio for video and for stills so we

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:31.820 
studio for video and for stills so we
have<00:04:30.240> basically<00:04:30.569> two<00:04:30.840> different<00:04:31.199> workflows

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
have basically two different workflows

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.650 
have basically two different workflows
for<00:04:31.860> each<00:04:32.280> and<00:04:32.580> we<00:04:32.789> have<00:04:32.940> different<00:04:33.150> computers

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
for each and we have different computers

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.110 
for each and we have different computers
that<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:33.900> access<00:04:34.400> different<00:04:35.400> folders<00:04:35.849> on<00:04:36.060> the

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
that can access different folders on the

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.170 
that can access different folders on the
same<00:04:36.599> Synology<00:04:37.199> they're<00:04:38.069> also<00:04:38.280> very<00:04:38.759> quick

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:39.180 
same Synology they're also very quick

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:41.089 
same Synology they're also very quick
and<00:04:39.360> they're<00:04:39.479> very<00:04:39.720> well<00:04:40.199> built<00:04:40.590> they're<00:04:40.919> more

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:41.099 
and they're very well built they're more

00:04:41.099 --> 00:04:42.620 
and they're very well built they're more
what<00:04:41.430> we<00:04:41.550> call<00:04:41.729> kind<00:04:41.910> of<00:04:42.030> business<00:04:42.449> and

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
what we call kind of business and

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.990 
what we call kind of business and
enterprise<00:04:43.080> class<00:04:43.639> solutions<00:04:44.639> but<00:04:44.849> they're

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
enterprise class solutions but they're

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.150 
enterprise class solutions but they're
also<00:04:45.180> priced<00:04:45.690> very<00:04:45.990> affordably<00:04:46.440> so<00:04:47.039> the

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:47.160 
also priced very affordably so the

00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.580 
also priced very affordably so the
priced<00:04:47.430> pretty<00:04:47.880> similarly<00:04:48.539> to<00:04:48.750> say<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> Drobo

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
priced pretty similarly to say a Drobo

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.890 
priced pretty similarly to say a Drobo
or<00:04:49.800> a<00:04:49.830> g-force<00:04:50.460> solution<00:04:50.880> as<00:04:50.970> well<00:04:51.150> but

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
or a g-force solution as well but

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.240 
or a g-force solution as well but
they're<00:04:52.050> very<00:04:52.169> reliable<00:04:52.650> units<00:04:53.009> and<00:04:53.160> they're

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
they're very reliable units and they're

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.400 
they're very reliable units and they're
very<00:04:53.370> well-made<00:04:53.910> so<00:04:54.810> at<00:04:54.900> this<00:04:55.020> point<00:04:55.229> you

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:55.410 
very well-made so at this point you

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:56.659 
very well-made so at this point you
should<00:04:55.440> have<00:04:55.770> a<00:04:55.800> good<00:04:56.069> basic<00:04:56.580> understanding

00:04:56.659 --> 00:04:56.669 
should have a good basic understanding

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:58.550 
should have a good basic understanding
of<00:04:57.180> the<00:04:57.240> different<00:04:57.330> storage<00:04:57.930> solutions<00:04:58.440> that

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
of the different storage solutions that
