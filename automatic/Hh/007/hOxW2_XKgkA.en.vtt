00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.790
 so here no we are aboard the bmw i3 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:13.019
 it's a vehicle released at the beginning of 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.619
 the year 2014 vehicle so 100% 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:18.270
 electric 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:21.539
 so this vehicle an autonomy of 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.369
 160 between 160 and 200 km in all 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.710
 electric and in addition the possibility 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.750
 with the range extender so a 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.859
 small heat engine that will maintain 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.060
 the state of charge of the battery of 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.580
 add 100 km of autonomy 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:35.760
 additional which allows to lift 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.290
 any anxiety that the 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.260
 users with regard to the use of a 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.350
 vehicle is a connected service 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.480
 specific to bmw i will be the assistant 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 of autonomy what we see here so on 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.440
 the navigation system edge screen 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.719
 you see so it's different done 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.329
 perimeter of autonomy so in white and 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.520
 in blue which actually has the radius 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.379
 action that will be able to achieve my 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.710
 vehicle according to its level of 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:04.559
 current load how does this work 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.690
 system it will take into account enormously 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.040
 of settings my charge level of 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.580
 battery obviously my style of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.010
 conduct 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.770
 the driving mode in which I am 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.450
 will bail out more comfort and will hold 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.100
 traffic information account what we 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.229
 sees in color on the screen is 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.790
 also and this is the most important of 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.530
 the topography of all roads so 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.170
 of the route but of the descents 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.180
 so a lot of data 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.729
 so it's an external server in the 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.450
 car that will calculate for all 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 possible tricks 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.700
 my autonomy my range of action and will 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.860
 so send them life to the vehicle 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 so comes the integrated sim card and 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:42.580
 that's how I'm going to be displayed 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.440
 so in my car my 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.870
 my radius of action and this same 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.600
 information I will find it 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.460
 so on my smartphone involvement that 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.380
 I can consult when I'm not 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.800
 in my vehicle and I want to know 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.480
 so my level of autonomy and my radius 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.000
 action I find rigorously 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.690
 obviously there even the same given on 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.760
 this application 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:08.500
 Here I can see my car his 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.470
 charge level without autonomy notes 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.850
 as well as different statutes and at 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.280
 level of the opening of the vehicle 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.310
 I can also remotely realize a 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.180
 number of control functions 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.130
 like for example lock 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.630
 unlock the car make a call 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.220
 of lights or make it honk for 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.260
 find the vehicle at night easily 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.850
 or on a parking also what is 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.530
 very important I can pre-conditioned 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.200
 including for example air conditioning the vehicle 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.270
 advance the idea is that in summer when 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.680
 my vehicle is plugged into the terminal I 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.240
 put it in condition I put it to 20 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.440
 degrees for that when I'm going to take 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.209
 my vehicle they are already fresh 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.709
 when I'm going to roll I'm not going 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.900
 need to consume on my 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.360
 battery to air condition my vehicle and 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.540
 so maximize my autonomy by rolling 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.900
 in 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.219
 in my vehicle so here are the 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:58.519
 applications and services really 

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:59.870
 specific to bmw i who are very 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.040
 important for the management of 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.540
 the autonomy and the uses of my 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.810
 electric vehicle at the level of 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:08.750
 services connecteddrive the service of 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.609
 Concierge service I simply start 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.510
 the service I launch the call 

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.700
 I dialogue with the agent he sends me the 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:18.769
 message and I take this message in 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.700
 the car for example so the message 

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:21.700
 he will appear here 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:29.540
 he gave me the address of a florist to 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:31.250
 proximity is simply I 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.150
 loading the mediation with 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.150
 the information received
