00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:11.770 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.109 

all<00:00:12.770> right<00:00:13.010> so<00:00:13.160> this<00:00:13.250> next<00:00:13.459> knot<00:00:13.879> we're<00:00:14.000> going

00:00:14.109 --> 00:00:14.119 
all right so this next knot we're going

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:16.299 
all right so this next knot we're going
to<00:00:14.180> do<00:00:14.270> is<00:00:14.480> the<00:00:14.719> half<00:00:15.170> windsor<00:00:15.440> knot<00:00:15.619> it's<00:00:16.129> a

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:16.309 
to do is the half windsor knot it's a

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:18.130 
to do is the half windsor knot it's a
step<00:00:16.610> up<00:00:16.789> I<00:00:16.970> think<00:00:17.029> from<00:00:17.690> the<00:00:17.810> four-in-hand

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
step up I think from the four-in-hand

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.929 
step up I think from the four-in-hand
knot<00:00:18.230> it<00:00:18.859> gives<00:00:19.099> you<00:00:19.250> more<00:00:19.460> gives<00:00:19.699> you<00:00:19.880> a

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
knot it gives you more gives you a

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:21.669 
knot it gives you more gives you a
triangle<00:00:20.480> shape<00:00:20.660> more<00:00:20.900> symmetrical<00:00:21.529> knot

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:21.679 
triangle shape more symmetrical knot

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:24.099 
triangle shape more symmetrical knot
that<00:00:22.640> classic<00:00:23.150> tie<00:00:23.300> look<00:00:23.509> that<00:00:23.660> a<00:00:23.689> lot<00:00:23.720> of<00:00:23.960> guys

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:24.109 
that classic tie look that a lot of guys

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.560 
that classic tie look that a lot of guys
are<00:00:24.259> looking<00:00:24.529> for<00:00:24.740> and<00:00:25.039> it's<00:00:25.550> great<00:00:25.759> for<00:00:26.029> ties

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:26.570 
are looking for and it's great for ties

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.790 
are looking for and it's great for ties
that<00:00:26.749> are<00:00:26.810> made<00:00:26.960> out<00:00:27.080> of<00:00:27.109> medium<00:00:27.560> to<00:00:27.650> heavy

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
that are made out of medium to heavy

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.130 
that are made out of medium to heavy
fabric<00:00:28.310> and<00:00:28.660> also<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.689> think<00:00:29.839> it<00:00:29.929> works<00:00:30.050> with

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
fabric and also I think it works with

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.630 
fabric and also I think it works with
any<00:00:30.289> type<00:00:30.320> of<00:00:30.560> collar<00:00:30.740> some<00:00:31.130> people<00:00:31.339> suggest

any type of collar some people suggest

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.890 
any type of collar some people suggest
you<00:00:31.730> should<00:00:31.820> wear<00:00:32.060> it<00:00:32.090> with<00:00:32.300> a<00:00:32.329> spread<00:00:32.870> collar

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
you should wear it with a spread collar

you should wear it with a spread collar
