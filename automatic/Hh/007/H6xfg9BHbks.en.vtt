00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 that of all his friends has come and 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.509
 today we meet for Christmas 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.920
 video so today I'm going to you 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:13.259
 learn to remove background noise from 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.730
 your microphone on audacity so you know 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.510
 for example the background noise is the 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.859
 microphones that are in background noise 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.289
 done while you're in the process of 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.449
 talk so I'm going to show you what 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.699
 that's waiting I'm a little 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.949
 hi recordings to all his friends 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:32.940
 it's true place today is actually 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.829
 too much here so normally you go 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.969
 hear 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.399
 hi to all his friends his valves place 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.140
 is today actually too much there 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.760
 here you hear is so there you 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.989
 see that there is a little bar and 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.350
 when you listen to that, it's so 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.940
 I teach you Damascus removed this 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.930
 so tutoring can be really very 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.469
 very long because it's really 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.649
 simple to do so there for example you 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:00.899
 save your video with your 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.250
 voice and so then that gives you that 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.570
 normally it's longer room apart 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.439
 if you make short videos but 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:12.720
 finally it depends so is then time to 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:14.130
 just so here's what you need 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.900
 do it so that's when you're done 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.710
 to save you do stop 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.390
 then you take a place where that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.799
 do a little bar like that and you 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.290
 listen if it's really a background noise 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.770
 or not so you take you do 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:31.170
 noise elimination effect take the 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.930
 noise profile then you click there 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.040
 where there is a mono and just like his 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.150
 seleccion all of a sudden so if 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.159
 you want to do it manually 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.189
 can a fact like that but me 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.950
 I prefer to do this then again effect 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.049
 noise elimination is so there you 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.810
 see that step 2 so be you you 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.909
 without you put more and your voice is going 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.399
 to be more distorted but we will hear 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.829
 either you put me and then prom before 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:58.740
 we'll hear a little bit of your voice 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.640
 will be much less distorted so here we go 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.549
 right now I'm using 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.979
 sort the triton ex pro and so that's 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.569
 like that I did the 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.039
 the recording here and 

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:12.620
 in fact when I put down altogether my 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.970
 voice is completely distorted so in 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.560
 done - must I put months to the maximum 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.500
 so I let you listen to that 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.780
 hello to all his friends his waves 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.240
 place and play so you see we 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:26.000
 do not hear the biz any more and that's it 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 and but by cons my voice is a whole 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 little bit distorted end it does a little 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:33.319
 as if we were echoing a little 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.550
 little but that's good I do not like it too much if I 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:36.050
 do not know if you noticed it but 

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.640
 on my last videos but said a 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.980
 video art I struggled I use this 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.110
 this function so then you makes 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.820
 remove the noise here 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.860
 and so there you see that the trait is 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.560
 much less thick so when you 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:50.390
 listen 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.459
 that's more than sweet at all and then 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.760
 it's really really good 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:58.100
 do so so here after you can 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.319
 listen to your voice hi to all his 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.390
 friends it 's better and today we are 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:04.459
 so here we really hear more 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.830
 of all the noise so here we follow 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.400
 could you can do exported file 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.920
 in a dream 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.340
 after you renamed yourself to files 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.560
 this is save you close and that's it 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.000
 so there you have your file and like 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.329
 you open it you see it works 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.459
 very well 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:22.850
