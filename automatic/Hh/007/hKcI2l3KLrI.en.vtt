also if you wanted something a little

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.320 
also if you wanted something a little
bit<00:02:45.269> easier<00:02:45.690> you<00:02:46.500> could<00:02:46.920> just<00:02:47.069> print<00:02:47.430> it<00:02:47.580> put

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
bit easier you could just print it put

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.630 
bit easier you could just print it put
the<00:02:48.420> template<00:02:48.810> onto<00:02:48.989> a<00:02:49.290> heavy<00:02:49.830> cardstock<00:02:50.220> and

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
the template onto a heavy cardstock and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.800 
the template onto a heavy cardstock and
then<00:02:50.790> just<00:02:50.940> cut<00:02:51.090> that<00:02:51.209> out<00:02:51.330> and<00:02:51.540> then<00:02:51.690> you

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
then just cut that out and then you

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.130 
then just cut that out and then you
won't<00:02:51.989> have<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> use<00:02:52.319> a<00:02:52.650> foam<00:02:52.890> board<00:02:53.540> if<00:02:54.540> you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
won't have to use a foam board if you

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.420 
won't have to use a foam board if you
wanted<00:02:55.470> something<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.890> little<00:02:55.920> bit<00:02:56.280> more

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430
