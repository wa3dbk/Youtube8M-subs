double chicken ah if I put very I would
but<00:03:34.709> just<00:03:35.100> no<00:03:35.280> same<00:03:36.000> which<00:03:36.180> window<00:03:36.569> I<00:03:37.110> needed

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
but just no same which window I needed

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.250 
but just no same which window I needed
to<00:03:38.069> pass<00:03:38.250> to<00:03:38.760> a<00:03:38.910> place<00:03:39.180> because<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.900> rank<00:03:40.020> for

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
to pass to a place because the rank for

00:03:40.260 --> 00:04:11.059 
to pass to a place because the rank for
engine<00:03:42.319> ignites<00:03:43.319> to<00:03:43.739> shoot<00:03:43.950> up<00:03:44.100> pretty<00:03:45.060> nice

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.100

really<00:04:27.610> good<00:04:27.789> so<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:28.090> key<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.360> really<00:04:28.539> nice<00:04:28.810> so

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
really good so the key is really nice so

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.350 
really good so the key is really nice so
if<00:04:29.229> you<00:04:29.460> shadow<00:04:30.460> fusion<00:04:33.030> if<00:04:34.030> you<00:04:34.180> have<00:04:34.270> a

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:34.360 
if you shadow fusion if you have a

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.240 
if you shadow fusion if you have a
shuttle<00:04:34.570> fusion<00:04:39.090> 19<00:04:40.090> pair<00:04:40.330> schemata<00:04:41.070> you<00:04:42.070> can

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
shuttle fusion 19 pair schemata you can

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.969 
shuttle fusion 19 pair schemata you can
shut<00:04:42.910> off<00:04:42.940> fusion<00:04:43.419> this<00:04:44.260> come<00:04:44.560> out<00:04:44.680> that<00:04:44.860> make

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
shut off fusion this come out that make

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.779 
shut off fusion this come out that make
this<00:04:45.100> trick<00:04:47.100> you<00:04:48.100> can<00:04:48.130> special<00:04:48.550> summon<00:04:48.580> him

00:04:48.779 --> 00:04:48.789 
this trick you can special summon him

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:51.000 
this trick you can special summon him
then<00:04:49.139> effective<00:04:50.139> constituted<00:04:50.680> beyond<00:04:50.919> the

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
then effective constituted beyond the

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.870 
then effective constituted beyond the
fields<00:04:51.340> you<00:04:52.620> who<00:04:53.620> the<00:04:53.740> effects<00:04:54.160> don't<00:04:54.700> suit<00:04:54.849> me

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
fields you who the effects don't suit me

00:04:54.880 --> 00:05:02.159 
fields you who the effects don't suit me
attack<00:04:55.240> twice<00:05:00.690> it<00:05:01.690> doesn't<00:05:01.990> have<00:05:02.080> the

00:05:02.159 --> 00:05:02.169 
attack twice it doesn't have the

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:03.779 
attack twice it doesn't have the
restriction<00:05:02.530> that's<00:05:02.710> a<00:05:02.919> piece<00:05:03.340> itself<00:05:03.580> cannot

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:03.789 
restriction that's a piece itself cannot

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:05.310 
restriction that's a piece itself cannot
attack<00:05:04.060> yeah<00:05:04.360> I<00:05:04.389> know<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:04.780> you<00:05:04.960> can<00:05:05.110> see<00:05:05.229> the

everything is pendulous then you turn
you<00:05:41.280> can<00:05:41.430> just<00:05:41.580> fusion<00:05:41.850> which<00:05:41.970> is<00:05:42.000> why<00:05:43.670> you

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
you can just fusion which is why you

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:46.310 
you can just fusion which is why you
must<00:05:44.760> really<00:05:45.060> like<00:05:45.180> answer<00:05:45.510> for<00:05:45.720> the<00:05:45.780> ICU<00:05:46.140> oh
