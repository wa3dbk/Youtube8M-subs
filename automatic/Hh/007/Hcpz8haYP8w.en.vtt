00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
beginning to think that uh they're not

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.539 
beginning to think that uh they're not
going<00:01:10.320> to<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:11.040> it<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.369> me<00:01:13.010> that<00:01:14.010> they<00:01:14.250> ran<00:01:14.520> out

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
going to get it to me that they ran out

going to get it to me that they ran out
of<00:01:14.790> stock<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:16.850> yeah<00:01:18.530> but<00:01:20.869> here<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.799> little

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.390 
of stock and yeah but here is the little

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.520 
of stock and yeah but here is the little
chopper<00:01:24.950> which<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.670> i<00:01:27.060> mostly<00:01:27.930> just<00:01:28.049> got

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
chopper which really i mostly just got

chopper which really i mostly just got
to<00:01:28.860> complete<00:01:29.549> the<00:01:29.759> set<00:01:30.530> except<00:01:31.530> that<00:01:31.740> i<00:01:31.770> can't

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to complete the set except that i can't

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.460 
to complete the set except that i can't
actually<00:01:32.490> complete<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.210> set<00:01:33.600> since<00:01:33.990> i<00:01:34.409> don't

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
actually complete the set since i don't

actually complete the set since i don't
have<00:01:34.740> Robin<00:01:35.280> yet<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:36.229> who<00:01:37.229> worry<00:01:37.500> about<00:01:37.799> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
have Robin yet but who worry about that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.389 
have Robin yet but who worry about that
later<00:01:39.049> but<00:01:40.520> actually<00:01:41.930> it's<00:01:42.930> pretty<00:01:43.470> nice

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
later but actually it's pretty nice

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.569 
later but actually it's pretty nice
actually<00:01:45.380> better<00:01:46.380> than<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.950> was<00:01:47.250> really

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
actually better than I was really

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:52.399 
actually better than I was really
expecting<00:01:48.710> obviously<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:50.540> poses<00:01:51.540> really<00:01:52.140> all

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
expecting obviously the poses really all

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.370 
expecting obviously the poses really all
that<00:01:52.590> exciting<00:01:53.220> or<00:01:53.369> anything<00:01:53.820> but<00:01:54.380> detail

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that exciting or anything but detail

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.560 
that exciting or anything but detail
wise<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.040> everything<00:01:56.490> he<00:01:56.790> looks<00:01:57.000> really<00:01:57.780> nice

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
wise and everything he looks really nice

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.670 
wise and everything he looks really nice
especially<00:02:01.189> obviously<00:02:02.189> on<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> Hat<00:02:03.290> no<00:02:04.290> real

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
especially obviously on the Hat no real

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.020 
especially obviously on the Hat no real
paint<00:02:05.130> blemishes<00:02:05.509> anywhere<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.750> all

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.530 

obviously<00:02:11.030> there's<00:02:11.269> not<00:02:11.450> really<00:02:11.719> much<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.049> say

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
obviously there's not really much to say

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.619 
obviously there's not really much to say
obviously<00:02:14.540> he<00:02:14.810> can<00:02:15.170> have<00:02:15.409> him<00:02:16.599> holding<00:02:17.599> his

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
obviously he can have him holding his

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:22.240 
obviously he can have him holding his
stick<00:02:18.290> and<00:02:19.180> he<00:02:20.180> also<00:02:20.359> comes<00:02:20.750> with<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.290> arm<00:02:21.739> to

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
stick and he also comes with the arm to

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.380 
stick and he also comes with the arm to
just<00:02:22.489> have<00:02:22.730> him<00:02:22.909> not<00:02:23.359> holding<00:02:23.870> a<00:02:23.959> stick<00:02:25.390> but

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
just have him not holding a stick but

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.349 
just have him not holding a stick but
i'll<00:02:26.750> have<00:02:27.260> him<00:02:27.579> holding<00:02:28.579> the<00:02:28.730> stick<00:02:28.970> because

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:29.359 
i'll have him holding the stick because

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.039 
i'll have him holding the stick because
it's<00:02:29.750> more<00:02:29.959> interesting<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.739> way<00:02:31.540> but<00:02:32.540> so

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:33.049 
it's more interesting that way but so

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.459 
it's more interesting that way but so
yeah<00:02:34.569> actually<00:02:35.569> I'm<00:02:36.079> kind<00:02:36.379> of<00:02:36.530> glad<00:02:36.739> that<00:02:37.340> time

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:38.469 
yeah actually I'm kind of glad that time

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:42.940 
yeah actually I'm kind of glad that time
decided<00:02:39.469> not<00:02:40.040> to<00:02:40.280> get<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.609> PLP<00:02:41.000> because<00:02:41.950> this

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
decided not to get the PLP because this

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.059 
decided not to get the PLP because this
one's<00:02:43.370> actually<00:02:43.670> just<00:02:45.040> fine<00:02:46.040> as<00:02:46.959> a<00:02:48.069> substitute

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
one's actually just fine as a substitute

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.339 
one's actually just fine as a substitute
I<00:02:49.489> mean<00:02:49.939> they're<00:02:50.120> pretty<00:02:50.299> much<00:02:50.629> the<00:02:50.900> same

00:02:51.339 --> 00:02:51.349 
I mean they're pretty much the same

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.890 
I mean they're pretty much the same
thing<00:02:51.950> except<00:02:52.639> for<00:02:52.939> the<00:02:53.090> fact<00:02:53.239> that<00:02:53.419> obviously

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
thing except for the fact that obviously

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.140 
thing except for the fact that obviously
this<00:02:54.079> one's<00:02:54.319> much<00:02:54.500> smaller<00:02:55.040> but<00:02:55.519> oh<00:02:55.669> well<00:02:56.120> I

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
this one's much smaller but oh well I

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:02.890 
this one's much smaller but oh well I
don't<00:02:56.359> care<00:02:56.750> and<00:02:57.549> here's<00:02:58.549> his<00:02:58.819> tiny<00:02:59.299> base<00:03:01.900> so

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
don't care and here's his tiny base so

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.520 
don't care and here's his tiny base so
there<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.260> go<00:03:03.409> and<00:03:03.859> just<00:03:04.250> to<00:03:04.459> show<00:03:04.519> you<00:03:05.269> how

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
there you go and just to show you how

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.420 
there you go and just to show you how
small<00:03:06.530> this<00:03:06.950> figure<00:03:07.370> actually<00:03:07.669> is<00:03:09.430> yeah

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
small this figure actually is yeah

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.969 
small this figure actually is yeah
there's<00:03:10.760> a<00:03:10.849> WCF<00:03:11.689> next<00:03:12.230> to<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:12.699> it's<00:03:13.699> actually

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:14.979 
there's a WCF next to it it's actually

00:03:14.979 --> 00:03:20.520 
there's a WCF next to it it's actually
shorter<00:03:15.979> than<00:03:16.340> the<00:03:16.790> WCF<00:03:17.659> so<00:03:18.470> obviously<00:03:19.010> it's

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
shorter than the WCF so obviously it's

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.240 
shorter than the WCF so obviously it's
bigger<00:03:21.530> overall<00:03:22.400> and<00:03:23.620> obviously<00:03:24.620> bigger<00:03:24.949> than

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
bigger overall and obviously bigger than

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.930 
bigger overall and obviously bigger than
what<00:03:25.549> a<00:03:25.579> chopper<00:03:26.180> WCF<00:03:26.930> would<00:03:27.199> be<00:03:27.409> but<00:03:28.510> still<00:03:29.510> I

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
what a chopper WCF would be but still I

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.210 
what a chopper WCF would be but still I
mean<00:03:31.940> obviously<00:03:32.090> it<00:03:32.720> is<00:03:32.930> to<00:03:33.260> be<00:03:33.440> in<00:03:33.680> scale<00:03:34.190> with

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
mean obviously it is to be in scale with

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.719 
mean obviously it is to be in scale with
the<00:03:34.699> rest<00:03:34.909> of<00:03:35.060> them<00:03:35.269> so<00:03:35.690> it<00:03:35.959> makes<00:03:36.319> sense<00:03:37.129> for

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:37.729 
the rest of them so it makes sense for

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:41.350 
the rest of them so it makes sense for
it<00:03:38.599> to<00:03:38.659> be<00:03:38.870> so<00:03:39.109> small

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
it to be so small

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:47.790 
it to be so small
but<00:03:42.550> yeah<00:03:43.550> other<00:03:43.790> than<00:03:44.060> that<00:03:44.470> it's<00:03:45.790> fine<00:03:46.790> and

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
but yeah other than that it's fine and

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.420 
but yeah other than that it's fine and
really<00:03:48.800> cheap<00:03:49.160> actually<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:49.850> was<00:03:50.000> like<00:03:51.430> 800

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:52.430

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.180 
really cheap actually it was like 800

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190
