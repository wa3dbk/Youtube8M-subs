00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
big return from Archer in this week's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.299 
big return from Archer in this week's
episode<00:00:47.840> and<00:00:48.079> it<00:00:48.350> seems<00:00:48.559> like<00:00:48.710> Archer<00:00:49.100> learned

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
episode and it seems like Archer learned

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.979 
episode and it seems like Archer learned
a<00:00:49.430> lot<00:00:49.640> from<00:00:49.699> Shiro<00:00:50.239> as<00:00:50.539> his<00:00:50.719> actual

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:50.989 
a lot from Shiro as his actual

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:52.959 
a lot from Shiro as his actual
appearance<00:00:51.530> in<00:00:51.680> this<00:00:51.829> episode<00:00:52.280> is<00:00:52.489> much

00:00:52.959 --> 00:00:52.969 
appearance in this episode is much

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:54.939 
appearance in this episode is much
closer<00:00:53.300> to<00:00:53.480> him<00:00:53.719> maybe<00:00:54.289> it's<00:00:54.530> because<00:00:54.710> he

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
closer to him maybe it's because he

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.410 
closer to him maybe it's because he
didn't<00:00:55.219> decide<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:55.670> slick<00:00:55.879> his<00:00:56.030> hair<00:00:56.239> back

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:56.420 
didn't decide to slick his hair back

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.029 
didn't decide to slick his hair back
maybe<00:00:57.050> it's<00:00:57.260> because<00:00:57.410> he's<00:00:57.680> starting<00:00:57.859> to

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
maybe it's because he's starting to

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.069 
maybe it's because he's starting to
adopt<00:00:58.460> his<00:00:58.609> mannerisms<00:00:59.300> but<00:00:59.719> that<00:00:59.899> was<00:01:00.050> a

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
adopt his mannerisms but that was a

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.750 
adopt his mannerisms but that was a
really<00:01:00.500> nice<00:01:00.680> scene<00:01:00.949> when<00:01:01.100> he<00:01:01.190> had<00:01:01.309> his<00:01:01.489> final

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760

when he finally brought Gilgamesh into

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.550 
when he finally brought Gilgamesh into
unlimited<00:01:17.360> blade<00:01:17.660> works<00:01:17.720> and<00:01:18.140> just<00:01:18.170> started

dominating<00:01:18.800> him<00:01:19.310> with<00:01:19.729> his<00:01:19.880> never-ending

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
dominating him with his never-ending

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.630 
dominating him with his never-ending
weapons<00:01:21.050> it<00:01:21.259> was<00:01:21.800> really<00:01:22.369> satisfying

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
weapons it was really satisfying

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.669 
weapons it was really satisfying
especially<00:01:23.300> when<00:01:23.690> he<00:01:23.750> was<00:01:23.869> getting<00:01:24.140> up<00:01:24.259> in<00:01:24.470> his

00:01:24.669 --> 00:01:24.679 
especially when he was getting up in his

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:26.949 
especially when he was getting up in his
face<00:01:24.950> and<00:01:25.190> I<00:01:25.490> loved<00:01:25.880> that<00:01:25.910> one<00:01:26.390> line<00:01:26.660> where<00:01:26.899> he

00:01:26.949 --> 00:01:26.959 
face and I loved that one line where he

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:28.449 
face and I loved that one line where he
said<00:01:27.170> the<00:01:27.289> reason<00:01:27.470> that<00:01:27.740> he's<00:01:27.890> going<00:01:28.099> to<00:01:28.190> lose

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:28.459 
said the reason that he's going to lose

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:30.639 
said the reason that he's going to lose
is<00:01:28.729> because<00:01:29.179> he's<00:01:29.360> a<00:01:29.390> king<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.959> not<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> warrior

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:30.649 
is because he's a king and not a warrior

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:31.930 
is because he's a king and not a warrior
and<00:01:30.950> that<00:01:30.979> makes<00:01:31.459> sense

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:31.940 
and that makes sense

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.029 
and that makes sense
he<00:01:32.179> completely<00:01:32.959> destroys<00:01:33.410> him<00:01:33.649> because

00:01:34.029 --> 00:01:34.039 
he completely destroys him because

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:35.109 
he completely destroys him because
there's<00:01:34.190> a<00:01:34.280> scene<00:01:34.459> where<00:01:34.580> he's<00:01:34.759> getting<00:01:34.910> ready

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:35.119 
there's a scene where he's getting ready

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.300 
there's a scene where he's getting ready
to<00:01:35.239> bring<00:01:35.509> out<00:01:35.630> his<00:01:35.780> ultimate<00:01:35.989> weapon<00:01:36.619> ei<00:01:36.920> and

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
to bring out his ultimate weapon ei and

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.219 
to bring out his ultimate weapon ei and
then<00:01:37.580> he<00:01:37.670> suddenly<00:01:37.940> cuts<00:01:38.390> his<00:01:38.569> arm<00:01:38.690> off<00:01:38.959> and

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
then he suddenly cuts his arm off and

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.279 
then he suddenly cuts his arm off and
gives<00:01:39.560> him<00:01:39.709> one<00:01:39.950> big<00:01:40.580> final<00:01:41.360> slash<00:01:41.780> it's

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:42.289 
gives him one big final slash it's

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:44.680 
gives him one big final slash it's
satisfying<00:01:43.039> as<00:01:43.310> hell<00:01:43.550> the<00:01:44.000> animation<00:01:44.569> is

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
satisfying as hell the animation is

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.660 
satisfying as hell the animation is
beyond<00:01:45.050> sexy<00:01:45.649> and<00:01:45.890> is<00:01:46.039> one<00:01:46.220> of<00:01:46.310> the<00:01:46.369> best

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
massive weapon and they just immediately

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:23.510

Gilgamesh in this week's episode I was
kind<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.220> hoping<00:03:41.430> they<00:03:41.970> would<00:03:42.120> get<00:03:42.270> to<00:03:42.390> have
