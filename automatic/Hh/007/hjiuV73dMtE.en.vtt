00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
but hopefully I'm optimistic but I'm

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.959 
but hopefully I'm optimistic but I'm
kind<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> optimistic<00:00:37.140> about<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.770> also<00:00:38.370> um

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
see a lot of potential there and because

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:24.800 
see a lot of potential there and because
everybody<00:02:23.190> demanded<00:02:23.730> after<00:02:24.090> that<00:02:24.269> commentary

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
I did beyblade metal fusion because I

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.080 
I did beyblade metal fusion because I
watched<00:02:28.200> it<00:02:28.470> and<00:02:28.680> honestly<00:02:29.159> there's<00:02:29.640> so<00:02:29.970> much

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
watched it and honestly there's so much

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.240 
watched it and honestly there's so much
potential<00:02:30.720> there<00:02:30.870> I<00:02:31.200> might<00:02:31.709> actually<00:02:31.920> get<00:02:32.190> to

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
potential there I might actually get to

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.430 
potential there I might actually get to
the<00:02:32.489> original<00:02:33.360> beyblade<00:02:33.780> do<00:02:34.019> one<00:02:34.200> shot<00:02:34.379> of

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
the original beyblade do one shot of

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.710 
the original beyblade do one shot of
that<00:02:34.560> considering<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.310> if<00:02:35.790> I<00:02:36.209> didn't<00:02:36.480> do<00:02:36.540> a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
that considering that if I didn't do a

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.509 
that considering that if I didn't do a
GX<00:02:37.260> in<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.530> beginning<00:02:37.709> I<00:02:38.099> would<00:02:38.310> have<00:02:38.400> been

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
GX in the beginning I would have been

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:41.720 
GX in the beginning I would have been
doing<00:02:38.760> beyblade<00:02:39.209> but<00:02:39.959> um<00:02:40.250> that's<00:02:41.250> going<00:02:41.549> to<00:02:41.610> be

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
doing beyblade but um that's going to be

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.430 
doing beyblade but um that's going to be
for<00:02:41.909> later<00:02:42.060> because<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.420> see<00:02:42.599> so<00:02:42.870> much<00:02:43.049> more<00:02:43.230> job

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
for later because I see so much more job

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.490 
for later because I see so much more job
potential<00:02:43.890> in<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.069> so<00:02:44.930> yeah<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:45.959> wouldn't

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
potential in that so yeah I wouldn't

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.069 
potential in that so yeah I wouldn't
really<00:02:46.709> I<00:02:47.129> wouldn't<00:02:48.000> really<00:02:48.090> think<00:02:48.209> of<00:02:48.660> what

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
really I wouldn't really think of what

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:50.960 
really I wouldn't really think of what
