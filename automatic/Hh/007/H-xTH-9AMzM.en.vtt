Apple headquarters is actually based in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.890 
Apple headquarters is actually based in
California<00:01:11.159> so<00:01:11.670> Mavericks<00:01:12.150> apparently<00:01:12.659> is<00:01:12.869> a

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
California so Mavericks apparently is a

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.830 
California so Mavericks apparently is a
surfing<00:01:13.590> /<00:01:13.860> Beach<00:01:14.159> area<00:01:14.460> near<00:01:15.030> work<00:01:15.270> Cupertino

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
surfing / Beach area near work Cupertino

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.960 
surfing / Beach area near work Cupertino
is<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.500> they<00:01:16.619> decided<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.040> name<00:01:17.280> it<00:01:17.460> about<00:01:17.759> that

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
is so they decided to name it about that

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.820 
is so they decided to name it about that
so<00:01:18.479> that's<00:01:18.630> why<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.810> called<00:01:18.990> OS<00:01:19.380> X<00:01:19.590> Mavericks

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
so that's why it's called OS X Mavericks

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.560 
so that's why it's called OS X Mavericks
so<00:01:20.340> they<00:01:20.460> covered<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.790> few<00:01:20.970> features<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.479> this

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
so they covered a few features in this

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.149 
so they covered a few features in this
OS<00:01:21.780> X<00:01:21.990> Mavericks<00:01:22.140> I'm<00:01:22.530> gonna<00:01:22.650> try<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> put<00:01:23.009> some

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
OS X Mavericks I'm gonna try to put some

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.679 
OS X Mavericks I'm gonna try to put some
pictures<00:01:23.400> right<00:01:23.700> here<00:01:23.759> for<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:24.180> guys<00:01:24.330> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
pictures right here for you guys the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
pictures right here for you guys the
first<00:01:24.960> one<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.170> called<00:01:25.380> finder<00:01:25.979> tabs<00:01:26.250> so

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
first one is called finder tabs so

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.100 
first one is called finder tabs so
essentially<00:01:27.000> what<00:01:27.119> finder<00:01:27.450> tabs<00:01:27.659> allows<00:01:27.960> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
essentially what finder tabs allows you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.499 
essentially what finder tabs allows you
to<00:01:28.229> do<00:01:28.470> is<00:01:28.680> when<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.250> finer<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.329> can

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
to do is when you have finer you can

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.210 
to do is when you have finer you can
make<00:01:30.720> different<00:01:30.960> windows<00:01:31.470> of<00:01:31.650> finder<00:01:32.009> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
make different windows of finder and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.130 
make different windows of finder and
then<00:01:32.310> put<00:01:32.490> them<00:01:32.640> all<00:01:32.850> into<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.509> window<00:01:33.930> and

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
then put them all into one window and

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.630 
then put them all into one window and
have<00:01:34.259> different<00:01:34.500> tabs<00:01:34.920> so<00:01:35.159> it's<00:01:35.369> actually

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
have different tabs so it's actually

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.640 
have different tabs so it's actually
like<00:01:35.729> using<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.150> web<00:01:36.329> browser<00:01:36.360> or<00:01:36.840> finder<00:01:37.259> so

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
like using a web browser or finder so

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:38.780 
like using a web browser or finder so
instead<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> having<00:01:38.009> like<00:01:38.310> 50<00:01:38.640> different

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
instead of having like 50 different

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.010 
instead of having like 50 different
finders<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.450> different<00:01:39.720> things<00:01:39.900> you're

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
finders with different things you're

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:41.660 
finders with different things you're
trying<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.259> look<00:01:40.380> for<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.920> can<00:01:41.189> just<00:01:41.340> unify

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
trying to look for you can just unify

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.609 
trying to look for you can just unify
into<00:01:42.119> one<00:01:42.360> window<00:01:42.689> of<00:01:42.840> finder<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.380> switch

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
into one window of finder and switch

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.289 
into one window of finder and switch
between<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:44.100> tabs<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.759> it<00:01:44.820> just<00:01:44.970> makes<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
between the tabs so it just makes it a

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:46.370 
between the tabs so it just makes it a
lot<00:01:45.390> easier<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:46.110> know<00:01:46.200> why<00:01:46.320> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
lot easier I don't know why the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.690 
lot easier I don't know why the
highlighted<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.040> too<00:01:47.189> much<00:01:47.340> because<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.610> my

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
highlighted is too much because in my

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.910 
highlighted is too much because in my
opinion<00:01:47.790> it's<00:01:48.149> not<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:48.840> big<00:01:49.049> of<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.259> deal<00:01:49.439> but

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
opinion it's not that big of a deal but

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.560 
opinion it's not that big of a deal but
also<00:01:50.070> they<00:01:50.280> said<00:01:50.490> that<00:01:50.579> finder<00:01:50.909> tabs<00:01:51.090> can<00:01:51.390> now

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
also they said that finder tabs can now

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.539 
also they said that finder tabs can now
be<00:01:51.780> used<00:01:51.810> in<00:01:52.229> full<00:01:52.500> screen<00:01:52.680> mode<00:01:52.799> so<00:01:53.340> now<00:01:53.490> you

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
be used in full screen mode so now you

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.010 
be used in full screen mode so now you
can<00:01:53.700> use<00:01:53.820> finder<00:01:54.180> in<00:01:54.299> full<00:01:54.509> screen<00:01:54.659> mode<00:01:54.840> which

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
can use finder in full screen mode which

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.600 
can use finder in full screen mode which
just<00:01:55.200> makes<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.530> an<00:01:55.619> overall<00:01:55.979> more<00:01:56.189> elegant

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
just makes it an overall more elegant

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.190 
just makes it an overall more elegant
way<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> use<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.210> secondly<00:01:57.719> they<00:01:57.869> announced

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
way to use it secondly they announced

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.780 
way to use it secondly they announced
tagging<00:01:58.710> so<00:01:58.920> essentially<00:01:59.310> what<00:01:59.399> tagging

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
tagging so essentially what tagging

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.310 
tagging so essentially what tagging
allows<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.600> when<00:02:01.020> you<00:02:01.110> save<00:02:01.290> a

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
allows you to do is when you save a

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.959 
allows you to do is when you save a
document<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:02.100> can<00:02:02.130> save<00:02:02.369> it<00:02:02.490> to<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> location

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
document you can save it to a location

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.789 
document you can save it to a location
which<00:02:03.450> you<00:02:03.630> always<00:02:03.840> do<00:02:04.140> but<00:02:04.409> now<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.590> can

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
which you always do but now you can

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.679 
which you always do but now you can
actually<00:02:04.950> tie<00:02:05.310> it<00:02:05.460> with<00:02:05.579> specific<00:02:06.180> keywords

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
actually tie it with specific keywords

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:08.660 
actually tie it with specific keywords
so<00:02:07.170> it's<00:02:07.320> actually<00:02:07.619> what<00:02:07.770> you<00:02:07.860> can<00:02:08.009> do<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.459> you

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
so it's actually what you can do is you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.400 
so it's actually what you can do is you
can<00:02:08.700> make<00:02:09.030> a<00:02:09.060> document<00:02:09.569> that's<00:02:09.599> about<00:02:09.929> apples

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
can make a document that's about apples

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.410 
can make a document that's about apples
and<00:02:10.619> then<00:02:10.709> tag<00:02:10.950> it<00:02:11.160> with<00:02:11.190> fruits<00:02:11.940> and<00:02:12.180> then<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
and then tag it with fruits and then you

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.580 
and then tag it with fruits and then you
can<00:02:12.540> make<00:02:12.629> a<00:02:12.660> document

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
can make a document

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.229 
can make a document
oranges<00:02:14.069> and<00:02:14.220> untag<00:02:14.459> that<00:02:14.670> with<00:02:14.879> fruit<00:02:15.120> and

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:15.239 
oranges and untag that with fruit and

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:16.250 
oranges and untag that with fruit and
they<00:02:15.360> can<00:02:15.480> all<00:02:15.599> be<00:02:15.629> stored<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.140> different

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
they can all be stored in different

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.110 
they can all be stored in different
drives<00:02:16.709> different<00:02:17.099> locations<00:02:17.519> but<00:02:17.879> then<00:02:18.030> in

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
drives different locations but then in

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.089 
drives different locations but then in
finder<00:02:18.540> you<00:02:18.870> can<00:02:19.019> just<00:02:19.200> search<00:02:19.379> for<00:02:19.590> fruits

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
finder you can just search for fruits

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:21.410 
finder you can just search for fruits
and<00:02:20.310> then<00:02:20.430> it<00:02:20.519> brings<00:02:20.640> up<00:02:20.790> everything<00:02:21.269> with

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
and then it brings up everything with

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.150 
and then it brings up everything with
that<00:02:21.450> tag<00:02:21.870> and<00:02:22.170> you<00:02:22.410> can<00:02:22.530> also<00:02:22.709> assign

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
that tag and you can also assign

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:25.220 
that tag and you can also assign
multiple<00:02:23.519> tags<00:02:23.970> to<00:02:24.239> each<00:02:24.390> document<00:02:24.750> so

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
multiple tags to each document so

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:26.479 
multiple tags to each document so
essentially<00:02:25.560> what<00:02:25.739> that<00:02:25.800> allows<00:02:26.010> you<00:02:26.250> to<00:02:26.310> do

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:26.489 
essentially what that allows you to do

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:28.339 
essentially what that allows you to do
is<00:02:26.670> if<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:26.940> make<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.150> document<00:02:27.690> called<00:02:27.720> Apple<00:02:28.200> I

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:28.349 
is if I make a document called Apple I

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.309 
is if I make a document called Apple I
can<00:02:28.500> assign<00:02:28.769> it<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.069> trees<00:02:30.030> and<00:02:30.360> fruit<00:02:30.989> so<00:02:31.200> when

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
can assign it to trees and fruit so when

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.630 
can assign it to trees and fruit so when
I<00:02:31.349> search<00:02:31.560> trees<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.129> will<00:02:32.220> come<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:32.430> under

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
I search trees it will come up under

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.490 
I search trees it will come up under
apples<00:02:33.030> and<00:02:33.239> then<00:02:33.330> when<00:02:33.420> I<00:02:33.450> search<00:02:33.750> fruit<00:02:34.319> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
apples and then when I search fruit it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.289 
apples and then when I search fruit it
will<00:02:34.590> also<00:02:34.799> come<00:02:35.010> up<00:02:35.129> on<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.370> Apple<00:02:35.819> document

00:02:36.289 --> 00:02:36.299 
will also come up on the Apple document

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.820 
will also come up on the Apple document
so<00:02:36.480> was<00:02:36.629> just<00:02:36.810> an<00:02:36.900> overall<00:02:37.170> easier<00:02:37.620> way<00:02:37.799> to

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
so was just an overall easier way to

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:39.589 
so was just an overall easier way to
unify<00:02:38.190> your<00:02:38.489> search<00:02:38.730> results<00:02:38.940> and<00:02:39.269> it

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
unify your search results and it

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.240 
unify your search results and it
basically<00:02:39.720> combines<00:02:40.200> everything<00:02:40.650> into<00:02:41.220> one

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
basically combines everything into one

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.280 
basically combines everything into one
search<00:02:41.730> result<00:02:42.120> and<00:02:42.299> just<00:02:42.660> makes<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.959> a<00:02:43.049> lot

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:43.290 
search result and just makes it a lot

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.990 
search result and just makes it a lot
easier<00:02:43.349> to<00:02:43.739> find<00:02:44.069> things<00:02:44.280> in<00:02:44.459> your<00:02:44.549> computer

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
easier to find things in your computer

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.460 
easier to find things in your computer
another<00:02:45.299> thing<00:02:45.540> they<00:02:45.630> now<00:02:45.810> sell<00:02:46.049> is<00:02:46.140> kind<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.410> a

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
another thing they now sell is kind of a

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.620 
another thing they now sell is kind of a
big<00:02:46.650> deal<00:02:46.680> was<00:02:47.130> the<00:02:47.280> multiple<00:02:47.849> displays<00:02:48.390> so

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
big deal was the multiple displays so

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:49.880 
big deal was the multiple displays so
now<00:02:48.750> they<00:02:48.900> made<00:02:49.019> it<00:02:49.140> a<00:02:49.200> lot<00:02:49.410> more<00:02:49.530> easy<00:02:49.769> to

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
now they made it a lot more easy to

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.920 
now they made it a lot more easy to
seamlessly<00:02:50.340> integrate<00:02:50.670> multiple<00:02:51.480> displays

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
seamlessly integrate multiple displays

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:53.569 
seamlessly integrate multiple displays
throughout<00:02:52.110> OSX<00:02:52.799> one<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.190> cool<00:02:53.370> things

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:53.579 
throughout OSX one of the cool things

actually make full screen applications
in<00:03:16.410> each<00:03:16.650> display<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.910> just<00:03:18.150> to<00:03:18.239> make<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
in each display so just to make the

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.000 
in each display so just to make the
overall<00:03:18.750> experience<00:03:18.930> a<00:03:19.290> lot<00:03:19.440> more<00:03:19.590> seamless

think is really cool you can essentially

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
think is really cool you can essentially
run<00:03:38.760> the<00:03:38.910> whole<00:03:39.090> Mac<00:03:39.299> OS<00:03:39.630> X<00:03:39.750> operating<00:03:39.959> system

on your Apple TV granted will be

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.879 
on your Apple TV granted will be
slightly<00:03:42.840> slower<00:03:43.260> due<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> lower

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:43.889 
slightly slower due to the lower

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:45.920 
slightly slower due to the lower
processing<00:03:44.459> power<00:03:44.639> but<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.299> very<00:03:45.510> cool<00:03:45.750> you

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
processing power but it is very cool you

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.420 
processing power but it is very cool you
can<00:03:46.079> show<00:03:46.260> a<00:03:46.290> lot<00:03:46.530> of<00:03:46.650> videos<00:03:47.040> pictures

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
can show a lot of videos pictures

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.580 
can show a lot of videos pictures
slideshows<00:03:48.030> on<00:03:48.180> your<00:03:48.329> Apple<00:03:48.660> TV<00:03:48.690> and<00:03:49.169> go<00:03:49.500> on

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
slideshows on your Apple TV and go on

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.900 
slideshows on your Apple TV and go on
the<00:03:49.680> internet<00:03:49.859> and<00:03:50.069> all<00:03:50.250> that<00:03:50.400> stuff<00:03:50.519> it<00:03:50.730> just

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the internet and all that stuff it just

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:52.640 
the internet and all that stuff it just
adds<00:03:51.030> another<00:03:51.180> use<00:03:51.630> of<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.870> Apple<00:03:52.169> TV<00:03:52.440> in<00:03:52.530> my

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
adds another use of the Apple TV in my

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.140 
adds another use of the Apple TV in my
opinion<00:03:52.889> so<00:03:53.220> further<00:03:53.489> they<00:03:53.730> talk<00:03:53.880> about<00:03:53.910> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
opinion so further they talk about this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.909 
opinion so further they talk about this
thing<00:03:54.359> is<00:03:54.480> called<00:03:54.660> advanced<00:03:55.260> technologies

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
thing is called advanced technologies

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:57.289 
thing is called advanced technologies
and<00:03:56.220> one<00:03:56.340> of<00:03:56.430> the<00:03:56.519> first<00:03:56.790> things<00:03:56.910> they<00:03:57.120> talked

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
and one of the first things they talked

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.690 
and one of the first things they talked
about<00:03:57.510> was<00:03:57.660> timer<00:03:58.019> coalescing<00:03:58.380> so<00:03:59.190> basically

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
about was timer coalescing so basically

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.039 
about was timer coalescing so basically
what<00:03:59.819> this<00:03:59.970> means<00:04:00.209> is<00:04:00.450> that<00:04:00.510> when<00:04:00.930> your

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049 
what this means is that when your

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.479 
what this means is that when your
computer<00:04:01.200> is<00:04:01.440> running<00:04:01.709> it<00:04:02.040> has<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> lot<00:04:02.459> of

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
computer is running it has a lot of

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.159 
computer is running it has a lot of
times<00:04:02.790> of<00:04:03.000> idle<00:04:03.359> and<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.569> lot<00:04:03.720> of<00:04:03.750> times<00:04:04.019> of

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
times of idle and a lot of times of

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:06.500 
times of idle and a lot of times of
activity<00:04:04.709> so<00:04:05.130> what<00:04:05.310> they<00:04:05.430> did<00:04:05.489> is<00:04:05.849> kind<00:04:06.359> of

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
activity so what they did is kind of

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.629 
activity so what they did is kind of
scratch<00:04:07.079> those<00:04:07.349> times<00:04:07.769> of<00:04:07.980> activity<00:04:08.489> together

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:08.639 
scratch those times of activity together

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:11.059 
scratch those times of activity together
so<00:04:09.180> you<00:04:09.239> have<00:04:09.510> more<00:04:09.840> idle<00:04:10.230> time<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.650> result<00:04:10.980> of

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:11.069 
so you have more idle time the result of

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:12.860 
so you have more idle time the result of
this<00:04:11.130> is<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.400> it<00:04:11.639> reduces<00:04:11.760> your<00:04:12.299> CPU

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
this is that it reduces your CPU

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.720 
this is that it reduces your CPU
utilization<00:04:13.169> by<00:04:13.709> about<00:04:14.010> seventy<00:04:14.519> two<00:04:14.700> percent

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
utilization by about seventy two percent

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.879 
utilization by about seventy two percent
and<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.480> result<00:04:15.959> of<00:04:16.049> this<00:04:16.139> is<00:04:16.380> a<00:04:16.410> lot<00:04:16.769> of

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:16.889 
and the result of this is a lot of

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:18.830 
and the result of this is a lot of
increased<00:04:17.280> battery<00:04:17.459> life<00:04:17.789> also<00:04:18.359> another<00:04:18.599> one

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 
increased battery life also another one

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:20.330 
increased battery life also another one
of<00:04:18.900> their<00:04:19.019> advanced<00:04:19.380> technologies<00:04:19.979> is<00:04:20.130> called

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
of their advanced technologies is called

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.279 
of their advanced technologies is called
compressed<00:04:20.849> memory<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:21.750> essentially<00:04:22.169> what

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
compressed memory so essentially what

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.050 
compressed memory so essentially what
this<00:04:22.469> does<00:04:22.710> is<00:04:22.919> you<00:04:23.070> have<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.490> little<00:04:23.849> bit<00:04:24.030> of

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
this does is you have a little bit of

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.399 
this does is you have a little bit of
active<00:04:24.570> memory<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.050> a<00:04:25.080> little<00:04:25.260> bit<00:04:25.380> of

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:25.409 
active memory and a little bit of

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:27.379 
active memory and a little bit of
inactive<00:04:26.039> memory<00:04:26.370> so<00:04:26.550> what<00:04:26.729> your<00:04:26.849> computer

00:04:27.379 --> 00:04:27.389 
inactive memory so what your computer

00:04:27.389 --> 00:04:29.119 
inactive memory so what your computer
have<00:04:27.449> to<00:04:27.599> do<00:04:27.780> is<00:04:27.990> essentially<00:04:28.379> take<00:04:28.740> out<00:04:28.949> that

00:04:29.119 --> 00:04:29.129 
have to do is essentially take out that

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.249 
have to do is essentially take out that
in<00:04:29.340> active<00:04:29.729> memory<00:04:29.939> and<00:04:30.270> make<00:04:30.389> it<00:04:30.569> free<00:04:30.960> memory

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:31.259 
in active memory and make it free memory

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.379 
in active memory and make it free memory
so<00:04:31.800> what<00:04:31.979> this<00:04:32.099> does<00:04:32.159> is<00:04:32.460> actually<00:04:32.610> scrunches

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389 
so what this does is actually scrunches

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:35.689 
so what this does is actually scrunches
an<00:04:33.539> inactive<00:04:34.020> memory<00:04:34.349> increases<00:04:35.219> the<00:04:35.340> active

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:35.699 
an inactive memory increases the active

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:37.399 
an inactive memory increases the active
memory<00:04:35.849> and<00:04:36.180> also<00:04:36.569> increases<00:04:37.080> the<00:04:37.199> free

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:37.409 
memory and also increases the free

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:39.260 
memory and also increases the free
memory<00:04:37.590> so<00:04:38.129> it<00:04:38.159> allows<00:04:38.490> your<00:04:38.669> memory<00:04:38.999> to<00:04:39.120> be

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
memory so it allows your memory to be

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.029 
memory so it allows your memory to be
utilized<00:04:39.689> better<00:04:39.900> furthermore<00:04:40.560> they've<00:04:40.889> also

00:04:41.029 --> 00:04:41.039 
utilized better furthermore they've also

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.920 
utilized better furthermore they've also
completely<00:04:41.669> changed<00:04:42.150> Safari<00:04:42.479> and<00:04:42.599> I<00:04:42.659> think<00:04:42.870> it

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:42.930 
completely changed Safari and I think it

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:43.999 
completely changed Safari and I think it
actually<00:04:43.020> looks<00:04:43.349> really<00:04:43.650> cool<00:04:43.830> though<00:04:43.979> I

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
actually looks really cool though I

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.469 
actually looks really cool though I
probably<00:04:44.340> still<00:04:44.669> use<00:04:44.849> Chrome<00:04:45.150> just<00:04:45.330> because

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:45.479 
probably still use Chrome just because

00:04:45.479 --> 00:04:46.969 
probably still use Chrome just because
I'm<00:04:45.599> so<00:04:45.749> used<00:04:45.779> to<00:04:46.139> it<00:04:46.259> after<00:04:46.439> the<00:04:46.650> Safari

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
I'm so used to it after the Safari

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.830 
I'm so used to it after the Safari
redesign<00:04:47.460> they've<00:04:47.639> added<00:04:47.879> a<00:04:47.969> sidebar<00:04:48.479> so<00:04:48.779> in

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
redesign they've added a sidebar so in

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:50.390 
redesign they've added a sidebar so in
the<00:04:48.930> sidebar<00:04:49.139> you<00:04:49.469> can<00:04:49.529> essentially<00:04:49.889> access

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.400 
the sidebar you can essentially access

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.830 
the sidebar you can essentially access
things<00:04:50.639> like<00:04:50.849> your<00:04:51.150> reading<00:04:51.449> list<00:04:51.479> and

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:51.840 
things like your reading list and

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:53.360 
things like your reading list and
bookmarks<00:04:52.319> and<00:04:52.409> also<00:04:52.919> there's<00:04:53.069> this<00:04:53.189> new

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:53.370 
bookmarks and also there's this new

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.129 
bookmarks and also there's this new
thing<00:04:53.400> called<00:04:53.610> shared<00:04:54.060> links<00:04:54.449> where<00:04:54.900> it's

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:55.139 
thing called shared links where it's

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:57.019 
thing called shared links where it's
basically<00:04:55.469> integrating<00:04:56.099> social<00:04:56.310> media<00:04:56.789> more

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
basically integrating social media more

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.269 
basically integrating social media more
to<00:04:57.210> Safari<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:58.110> it<00:04:58.199> allows<00:04:58.409> you<00:04:58.529> to<00:04:58.620> see<00:04:58.830> links

00:04:59.269 --> 00:04:59.279 
to Safari so it allows you to see links

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:00.439 
to Safari so it allows you to see links
that<00:04:59.400> your<00:04:59.580> friends<00:04:59.849> have<00:04:59.909> shared<00:05:00.210> throughout

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:00.449 
that your friends have shared throughout

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.540 
that your friends have shared throughout
Twitter<00:05:00.810> Facebook<00:05:01.169> or<00:05:01.590> Google+<00:05:01.979> or<00:05:02.219> any<00:05:02.400> of

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.189 
Twitter Facebook or Google+ or any of
those<00:05:02.639> things<00:05:02.909> he<00:05:03.150> also<00:05:03.360> emphasized<00:05:03.870> a<00:05:03.900> lot<00:05:04.080> of

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:04.199 
those things he also emphasized a lot of

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:05.689 
those things he also emphasized a lot of
speed<00:05:04.409> improvements<00:05:04.889> they've<00:05:05.009> done<00:05:05.219> actually

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:05.699 
speed improvements they've done actually

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:07.040 
speed improvements they've done actually
benchmark<00:05:06.180> safarian<00:05:06.569> showed<00:05:06.840> how<00:05:06.990> much

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
benchmark safarian showed how much

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:08.480 
benchmark safarian showed how much
faster<00:05:07.349> was<00:05:07.710> compared<00:05:08.069> to<00:05:08.099> Chrome<00:05:08.340> and

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
faster was compared to Chrome and

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.499 
faster was compared to Chrome and
Firefox<00:05:08.520> which<00:05:09.090> I<00:05:09.180> thought<00:05:09.300> was<00:05:09.419> very

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
Firefox which I thought was very

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:10.999 
Firefox which I thought was very
interesting<00:05:09.750> but<00:05:10.289> they<00:05:10.439> made<00:05:10.590> improve<00:05:10.860> miss

00:05:10.999 --> 00:05:11.009 
interesting but they made improve miss

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.350 
interesting but they made improve miss
the<00:05:11.129> things<00:05:11.279> like<00:05:11.430> JavaScript<00:05:12.000> basically

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.360 
the things like JavaScript basically

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.149 
the things like JavaScript basically
just<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.659> increase<00:05:12.810> the<00:05:13.080> speed<00:05:13.289> and<00:05:13.560> also<00:05:13.979> to

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
just to increase the speed and also to

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.469 
just to increase the speed and also to
increase<00:05:14.279> battery<00:05:14.639> life<00:05:14.819> and<00:05:15.029> speed<00:05:15.360> they

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
increase battery life and speed they

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:16.939 
increase battery life and speed they
made<00:05:15.629> it<00:05:15.719> so<00:05:15.779> that<00:05:15.810> Safari<00:05:16.289> actually<00:05:16.650> uses

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 
made it so that Safari actually uses

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.309 
made it so that Safari actually uses
less<00:05:17.490> energy<00:05:17.699> and<00:05:18.000> less<00:05:18.389> memory<00:05:18.750> another<00:05:19.110> cool

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:19.319 
less energy and less memory another cool

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:21.529 
less energy and less memory another cool
feature<00:05:19.379> in<00:05:19.860> mac<00:05:19.979> OS<00:05:20.159> x<00:05:20.430> mavericks<00:05:20.669> is<00:05:21.120> that<00:05:21.300> it

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539 
feature in mac OS x mavericks is that it

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.300 
feature in mac OS x mavericks is that it
has<00:05:21.659> iCloud<00:05:22.169> keychain<00:05:22.199> so<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:22.919> don't<00:05:23.159> know<00:05:23.219> if

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
has iCloud keychain so I don't know if

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:24.559 
has iCloud keychain so I don't know if
you<00:05:23.370> guys<00:05:23.460> know<00:05:23.699> but<00:05:23.849> in<00:05:23.909> your<00:05:24.029> McAfee<00:05:24.389> search

00:05:24.559 --> 00:05:24.569 
you guys know but in your McAfee search

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.510 
you guys know but in your McAfee search
spotlight<00:05:25.169> for<00:05:25.379> keychain<00:05:25.800> access<00:05:26.009> it

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
spotlight for keychain access it

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.249 
spotlight for keychain access it
actually<00:05:27.150> has<00:05:27.330> almost<00:05:27.629> every<00:05:27.990> password

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
actually has almost every password

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.230 
actually has almost every password
you've<00:05:28.589> ever<00:05:28.710> typed<00:05:29.009> in<00:05:29.219> into<00:05:29.520> an<00:05:29.610> application

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
you've ever typed in into an application

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.209 
you've ever typed in into an application
on<00:05:30.419> your<00:05:30.629> Mac<00:05:30.779> actually<00:05:31.229> stored<00:05:31.680> so

00:05:32.209 --> 00:05:32.219 
on your Mac actually stored so

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:33.950 
on your Mac actually stored so
essentially<00:05:32.580> what<00:05:32.729> iCloud<00:05:33.180> keychain<00:05:33.210> does<00:05:33.779> is

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
essentially what iCloud keychain does is

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.050 
essentially what iCloud keychain does is
it<00:05:34.289> remembers<00:05:34.740> all<00:05:34.889> of<00:05:34.979> your<00:05:35.099> website<00:05:35.400> logins

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:36.060 
it remembers all of your website logins

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:37.700 
it remembers all of your website logins
your<00:05:36.270> credit<00:05:36.599> card<00:05:36.779> numbers<00:05:37.080> which<00:05:37.229> is<00:05:37.439> kind

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710 
your credit card numbers which is kind

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:39.499 
your credit card numbers which is kind
of<00:05:37.800> weird<00:05:37.979> and<00:05:38.219> all<00:05:38.819> of<00:05:38.849> your<00:05:39.060> Wi-Fi<00:05:39.479> network

00:05:39.499 --> 00:05:39.509 
of weird and all of your Wi-Fi network

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:41.719 
of weird and all of your Wi-Fi network
passwords<00:05:40.349> so<00:05:40.770> this<00:05:40.860> is<00:05:40.979> very<00:05:41.219> cool<00:05:41.400> you<00:05:41.580> don't

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:41.729 
passwords so this is very cool you don't

00:05:41.729 --> 00:05:43.010 
passwords so this is very cool you don't
have<00:05:41.849> to<00:05:42.000> worry<00:05:42.210> about<00:05:42.330> remembering<00:05:42.569> all<00:05:42.990> of

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
have to worry about remembering all of

have to worry about remembering all of
your<00:05:43.169> passwords<00:05:43.319> as<00:05:43.770> much<00:05:43.919> so<00:05:44.099> you<00:05:44.189> can<00:05:44.310> access

00:05:44.629 --> 00:05:44.639 
your passwords as much so you can access

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
and also these are state because they

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:49.399 
and also these are state because they
are<00:05:48.210> encrypted<00:05:48.629> and<00:05:48.779> they<00:05:48.899> are<00:05:49.020> synced<00:05:49.349> across

improved<00:05:53.039> a<00:05:53.189> lot<00:05:53.310> is<00:05:53.490> notification<00:05:54.330> so

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:54.479 
improved a lot is notification so

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:56.119 
improved a lot is notification so
notifications<00:05:55.139> now<00:05:55.289> pops<00:05:55.589> up<00:05:55.740> in<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.919> top

00:05:56.119 --> 00:05:56.129

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:00.980 
intrusive and just shows up a lot better
in<00:05:59.520> my<00:05:59.639> opinion<00:05:59.669> and<00:06:00.180> now<00:06:00.360> the<00:06:00.419> apps<00:06:00.779> on<00:06:00.960> your

in my opinion and now the apps on your

00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.260 
in my opinion and now the apps on your
iOS<00:06:01.229> phone<00:06:01.800> that<00:06:02.009> some<00:06:02.189> push<00:06:02.460> notifications

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:03.270 
iOS phone that some push notifications

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:05.329 
iOS phone that some push notifications
can<00:06:03.389> also<00:06:03.629> now<00:06:03.960> send<00:06:04.259> push<00:06:04.469> notifications<00:06:04.529> to

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
can also now send push notifications to

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.070 
can also now send push notifications to
your<00:06:05.370> Mac<00:06:05.580> if<00:06:05.729> you<00:06:05.849> allow<00:06:06.060> it<00:06:06.270> personally<00:06:07.020> I

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
your Mac if you allow it personally I

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.079 
your Mac if you allow it personally I
hate<00:06:07.469> push<00:06:07.710> notifications<00:06:08.430> most<00:06:08.669> of<00:06:08.819> the<00:06:08.909> time

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:09.089 
hate push notifications most of the time

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:10.879 
hate push notifications most of the time
so<00:06:09.509> I<00:06:09.569> usually<00:06:09.899> just<00:06:09.930> disable<00:06:10.529> them<00:06:10.649> but<00:06:10.800> if

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:10.889 
so I usually just disable them but if

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.619 
so I usually just disable them but if
you<00:06:11.039> rely<00:06:11.520> on<00:06:11.699> that<00:06:11.789> for<00:06:12.000> things<00:06:12.149> like<00:06:12.210> sports

00:06:12.619 --> 00:06:12.629 
you rely on that for things like sports

00:06:12.629 --> 00:06:14.689 
you rely on that for things like sports
us<00:06:12.810> up<00:06:12.990> this<00:06:13.319> can<00:06:13.500> be<00:06:13.620> very<00:06:13.860> useful<00:06:13.949> to<00:06:14.310> just

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:14.699 
us up this can be very useful to just

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.189 
us up this can be very useful to just
like<00:06:14.789> pushing<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.240> sports<00:06:15.539> scores<00:06:15.870> to<00:06:16.110> your

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:16.199 
like pushing the sports scores to your

00:06:16.199 --> 00:06:17.959 
like pushing the sports scores to your
computer<00:06:16.649> just<00:06:17.099> so<00:06:17.219> it's<00:06:17.339> easier<00:06:17.639> to<00:06:17.789> access

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:17.969 
computer just so it's easier to access

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:19.850 
computer just so it's easier to access
and<00:06:18.360> view<00:06:18.509> them<00:06:18.689> another<00:06:19.199> thing<00:06:19.500> that<00:06:19.529> they've

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
and view them another thing that they've

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.829 
and view them another thing that they've
redesigned<00:06:20.189> and<00:06:20.610> improved<00:06:20.729> is<00:06:21.149> the<00:06:21.270> calendar

00:06:21.829 --> 00:06:21.839 
redesigned and improved is the calendar

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:23.089 
redesigned and improved is the calendar
so<00:06:22.229> the<00:06:22.349> calendar<00:06:22.680> they're<00:06:22.800> going<00:06:22.919> to<00:06:22.979> talk

00:06:23.089 --> 00:06:23.099 
so the calendar they're going to talk

00:06:23.099 --> 00:06:24.529 
so the calendar they're going to talk
too<00:06:23.250> much<00:06:23.399> about<00:06:23.460> but<00:06:23.879> it's<00:06:24.089> actually<00:06:24.240> is

00:06:24.529 --> 00:06:24.539 
too much about but it's actually is

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:26.659 
too much about but it's actually is
redesigned<00:06:25.110> a<00:06:25.229> little<00:06:25.529> bit<00:06:25.710> and<00:06:25.889> also<00:06:26.159> it

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
redesigned a little bit and also it

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.040 
redesigned a little bit and also it
allows<00:06:26.759> you<00:06:27.060> more<00:06:27.089> functionality<00:06:27.930> by

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
allows you more functionality by

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.200 
allows you more functionality by
utilizing<00:06:28.649> the<00:06:28.680> location<00:06:29.580> services<00:06:30.000> better

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:30.210 
utilizing the location services better

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:31.639 
utilizing the location services better
and<00:06:30.509> basically<00:06:30.779> just<00:06:30.990> allow<00:06:31.259> you<00:06:31.319> to

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:31.649 
and basically just allow you to

00:06:31.649 --> 00:06:33.709 
and basically just allow you to
integrate<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.250> location<00:06:32.849> services<00:06:33.360> and<00:06:33.599> the

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:33.719 
integrate the location services and the

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:34.879 
integrate the location services and the
mass<00:06:33.899> better<00:06:34.229> throughout<00:06:34.529> the<00:06:34.680> calendar

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
mass better throughout the calendar

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.559 
mass better throughout the calendar
speaking<00:06:35.550> of<00:06:35.610> maps<00:06:35.849> they<00:06:36.029> have<00:06:36.180> actually

00:06:36.559 --> 00:06:36.569 
speaking of maps they have actually

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:38.029 
speaking of maps they have actually
started<00:06:36.750> to<00:06:36.899> integrate<00:06:37.349> more<00:06:37.589> of<00:06:37.709> the<00:06:37.860> maps

00:06:38.029 --> 00:06:38.039 
started to integrate more of the maps

00:06:38.039 --> 00:06:40.369 
started to integrate more of the maps
into<00:06:38.339> OS<00:06:38.759> X<00:06:38.940> Mavericks<00:06:39.149> so<00:06:39.779> basically<00:06:40.199> what

00:06:40.369 --> 00:06:40.379 
into OS X Mavericks so basically what

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:41.239 
into OS X Mavericks so basically what
they<00:06:40.500> talked<00:06:40.740> about

00:06:41.239 --> 00:06:41.249 
they talked about

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.679 
they talked about
pretty<00:06:41.459> much<00:06:41.579> has<00:06:41.759> the<00:06:41.879> same<00:06:42.059> features<00:06:42.449> as<00:06:42.479> the

00:06:42.679 --> 00:06:42.689 
pretty much has the same features as the

00:06:42.689 --> 00:06:45.169 
pretty much has the same features as the
iOS<00:06:43.259> 6<00:06:43.529> map<00:06:43.739> that<00:06:44.009> has<00:06:44.039> improved<00:06:44.519> flyover

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:45.179 
iOS 6 map that has improved flyover

00:06:45.179 --> 00:06:46.789 
iOS 6 map that has improved flyover
points<00:06:45.569> of<00:06:45.659> location<00:06:46.169> and<00:06:46.439> turn-by-turn

00:06:46.789 --> 00:06:46.799 
points of location and turn-by-turn

00:06:46.799 --> 00:06:48.199 
points of location and turn-by-turn
directions<00:06:47.159> which<00:06:47.639> in<00:06:47.759> my<00:06:47.819> opinion<00:06:47.909> is

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:48.209 
directions which in my opinion is

00:06:48.209 --> 00:06:49.879 
directions which in my opinion is
nothing<00:06:48.509> new<00:06:48.689> but<00:06:49.139> they<00:06:49.259> also<00:06:49.409> have<00:06:49.649> something

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:49.889 
nothing new but they also have something

00:06:49.889 --> 00:06:51.349 
nothing new but they also have something
that<00:06:50.009> I<00:06:50.069> thought<00:06:50.309> was<00:06:50.369> really<00:06:50.639> cool<00:06:50.909> so

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:51.359 
that I thought was really cool so

00:06:51.359 --> 00:06:52.939 
that I thought was really cool so
essentially<00:06:51.629> we<00:06:51.809> can<00:06:51.989> do<00:06:52.139> is<00:06:52.319> set<00:06:52.499> up<00:06:52.529> a<00:06:52.709> route

00:06:52.939 --> 00:06:52.949 
essentially we can do is set up a route

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:54.859 
essentially we can do is set up a route
on<00:06:53.159> your<00:06:53.189> Mac<00:06:53.549> and<00:06:53.789> then<00:06:54.179> you<00:06:54.269> can<00:06:54.419> send<00:06:54.689> that

00:06:54.859 --> 00:06:54.869 
on your Mac and then you can send that

00:06:54.869 --> 00:06:57.079 
on your Mac and then you can send that
route<00:06:55.049> over<00:06:55.439> to<00:06:55.649> your<00:06:55.769> iOS<00:06:56.069> device<00:06:56.579> so<00:06:56.939> when

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:57.089 
route over to your iOS device so when

00:06:57.089 --> 00:06:58.669 
route over to your iOS device so when
you<00:06:57.179> go<00:06:57.299> into<00:06:57.419> your<00:06:57.539> iOS<00:06:57.899> device<00:06:58.379> you<00:06:58.589> can

00:06:58.669 --> 00:06:58.679 
you go into your iOS device you can

00:06:58.679 --> 00:07:00.319 
you go into your iOS device you can
slide<00:06:58.979> to<00:06:59.099> unlock<00:06:59.129> and<00:06:59.609> then<00:06:59.699> it<00:06:59.879> immediately

00:07:00.319 --> 00:07:00.329 
slide to unlock and then it immediately

00:07:00.329 --> 00:07:01.999 
slide to unlock and then it immediately
gives<00:07:00.809> you<00:07:00.989> the<00:07:01.109> directions<00:07:01.409> that<00:07:01.709> you<00:07:01.799> typed

00:07:01.999 --> 00:07:02.009 
gives you the directions that you typed
