00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.920 
drawn see your caption and they'll draw
a<00:01:44.250> continuation<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.090> story<00:01:45.360> they'll

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
a continuation to the story they'll

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.359 
a continuation to the story they'll
think<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.320> next<00:01:46.439> sentence<00:01:46.860> for<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.070> story

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
think of the next sentence for the story

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:48.940 
think of the next sentence for the story
and<00:01:47.610> then<00:01:47.850> draw<00:01:48.000> a<00:01:48.030> picture<00:01:48.299> for<00:01:48.420> it<00:01:48.689> as<00:01:48.780> well

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
and then draw a picture for it as well

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.100 
and then draw a picture for it as well
so<00:01:49.950> eventually<00:01:50.880> what<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.360> happen<00:01:51.810> is<00:01:52.049> for

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
so eventually what will happen is for

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:54.170 
so eventually what will happen is for
every<00:01:53.070> single<00:01:53.280> different<00:01:53.640> sentence<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.119> the

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
every single different sentence of the

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.359 
every single different sentence of the
story<00:01:54.450> we<00:01:55.259> will<00:01:55.470> have<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.740> different<00:01:56.100> picture

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
story we will have a different picture

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.810 
story we will have a different picture
to<00:01:56.610> represent<00:01:56.729> it<00:01:57.240> so<00:01:58.200> for<00:01:58.439> example<00:01:58.579> the<00:01:59.579> first

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
to represent it so for example the first

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.969 
to represent it so for example the first
story<00:02:00.090> could<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.420> the<00:02:01.170> total<00:02:01.439> seeking<00:02:01.680> peasley

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
story could be the total seeking peasley

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.590 
story could be the total seeking peasley
at<00:02:02.070> home<00:02:02.250> somebody<00:02:02.939> draws<00:02:03.119> a<00:02:03.149> picture<00:02:03.360> of<00:02:03.570> a

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
at home somebody draws a picture of a

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.080 
at home somebody draws a picture of a
nap<00:02:03.750> then<00:02:04.530> the<00:02:04.680> follow-up<00:02:04.920> could<00:02:05.159> be<00:02:05.340> all<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
nap then the follow-up could be all of a

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.850 
nap then the follow-up could be all of a
sudden<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.540> swarm<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.990> winged<00:02:07.229> kuriboh<00:02:07.740> is

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
sudden a swarm of winged kuriboh is

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.710 
sudden a swarm of winged kuriboh is
attack<00:02:08.160> his<00:02:08.310> house<00:02:08.520> and<00:02:08.819> then<00:02:09.270> somebody<00:02:09.450> draw

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
attack his house and then somebody draw

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.720 
attack his house and then somebody draw
a<00:02:09.750> picture<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.200> and<00:02:10.679> eventually<00:02:11.520> the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
a picture of that and eventually the

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400 
a picture of that and eventually the
story<00:02:12.000> will<00:02:12.120> go<00:02:12.209> on<00:02:12.360> and<00:02:12.569> on<00:02:12.629> and<00:02:12.780> on

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
story will go on and on and on

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:14.690 
story will go on and on and on
until<00:02:13.860> we<00:02:13.920> probably<00:02:14.100> have<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> don't<00:02:14.640> know

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
until we probably have I don't know

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.030 
until we probably have I don't know
about<00:02:14.820> 10<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.870> 20<00:02:16.050> different<00:02:16.350> sentences<00:02:16.890> and

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
about 10 to 20 different sentences and

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.450 
about 10 to 20 different sentences and
pictures<00:02:17.400> and<00:02:17.900> it'll<00:02:18.900> be<00:02:18.990> brilliant<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.740> of

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
pictures and it'll be brilliant and of

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:21.440 
pictures and it'll be brilliant and of
course<00:02:20.640> we'll<00:02:20.850> have<00:02:21.000> three<00:02:21.270> different

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
course we'll have three different

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.110 
course we'll have three different
ongoing<00:02:22.050> stories<00:02:22.440> at<00:02:22.560> once<00:02:22.800> so<00:02:23.580> when<00:02:23.880> you<00:02:23.970> also

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
ongoing stories at once so when you also

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:25.190 
ongoing stories at once so when you also
meet<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:24.450> things<00:02:24.630> I'll<00:02:24.780> pick<00:02:24.900> the<00:02:24.990> three

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
meet your things I'll pick the three

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.290 
meet your things I'll pick the three
best<00:02:25.680> ones<00:02:25.980> or<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.370> free<00:02:26.550> ones<00:02:26.790> which<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.060> think

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
best ones or the free ones which I think

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.820 
best ones or the free ones which I think
could<00:02:27.450> expand<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:27.990> most<00:02:28.200> into<00:02:28.470> an<00:02:28.560> awesome

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
could expand the most into an awesome

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.520 
could expand the most into an awesome
story<00:02:29.040> and<00:02:29.630> i<00:02:30.630> will<00:02:30.870> post<00:02:30.990> them<00:02:31.170> in<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.320> next

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.410 
story and i will post them in the next
video<00:02:31.770> and<00:02:31.970> people<00:02:32.970> can<00:02:33.090> continue<00:02:33.420> away<00:02:33.660> so

just<00:02:36.420> to<00:02:36.660> summarize<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.440> concept<00:02:38.690> go<00:02:39.690> away

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
just to summarize the concept go away
