there<00:00:43.430> at<00:00:44.430> first<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.880> thought<00:00:45.030> I<00:00:45.090> was<00:00:45.270> going<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
have to use a sawzall but I don't think

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.830 
have to use a sawzall but I don't think
it's<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.220> a<00:00:47.250> bad<00:00:47.430> break<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.780> I

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
it's going to be a bad break so then I

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.110 
it's going to be a bad break so then I
take<00:00:48.990> it<00:00:49.050> apart<00:00:49.350> there<00:00:49.760> I'm<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.880> to<00:00:50.940> put
