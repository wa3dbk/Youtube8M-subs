00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 I meet Javier Becerra 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.029
 physical coach of the national team 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:09.150
 Mexican is alive for what they will be if 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.769
 all very well excellent 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.349
 first of all I want you to tell us 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.269
 what is your good job more than 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 nothing and in general terms I explain to you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.609
 that my work consists of two things 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.680
 fundamental one is to prevent the risk 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.000
 of son- in- law injuries and the other is to optimize 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.970
 the performance of our players 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.800
 football and like this more good right now 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.800
 come with me and I give you a little taste 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.329
 of what is part of that training 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.980
 so for everyone good here we go 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:37.720
 to give a taste of what's coming 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.300
 making the players in the selection 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:42.250
 national to warm up to do 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.649
 an activation that they prepare for already 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.300
 be the training or the same 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:48.820
 good competition first that nothing to do 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.829
 a little bit of mobility at the hips 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.170
 we started in front like this in this 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.489
 prohibition today opposite and to the 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:57.440
 same time I'm going to activate a little bit 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.260
 the buttocks or squeeze the glutes 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.239
 is a series of 5 to 8 repetitions and 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.759
 then we change to the other side 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.590
 then for more than anything to activate the 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.080
 part of the psoas or the sector of 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:11.479
 hips and we can also do it in a 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.630
 angle 45 degrees more than anything for 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:17.450
 also move a little the adductor 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.040
 part of the inside of the leg once 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.330
 done that then we went on to make a 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.060
 little bit of activation what we 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.610
 we call pillar activation and what 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:28.190
 we can perform by making a series of 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.970
 exercises similar to these is a is a 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.450
 bridge and we do a little touch of 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.590
 shoulders without moving or rotating the pelvis 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.009
 we just play trying to keep 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.409
 a straight line of 5 to 8 repetitions of 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:45.009
 each side after then well then 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:47.630
 We pass forgiveness to do a little bit of 

00:01:45.009 --> 00:01:50.899
 more dynamic exercises or stretches 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.270
 an example is an exercise like this one I'm going 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:56.090
 downwards chest up without bending the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.899
 my back went down a little, I open a little 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.899
 little bit with peace 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.410
 I bring the hand behaved and I extend 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.840
 back to feel good 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.530
 stretching in the calves and 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.740
 also in the later return 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.990
 changed leg I come down here under 

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:17.260
 the elbow 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.720
 I open 

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.670
 arm to the side and back and 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.010
 later we went on to do what is 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:28.329
 the gluteal activation and how 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.769
 we will realize that we use a 

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:33.640
 I implement like this that they are mini 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.260
 resistance bands we put this 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.879
 shape around the knees yes 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 we want to add a little more 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:41.530
 tension we can add another good band 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:43.720
 we go down to what we call a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.180
 athletic position we go down in this way 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.250
 trying to keep well aligned well 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.409
 our pillar that is our shoulders 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.730
 of the torso and hips and I begin to 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:53.079
 go down 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.329
 in this way doing a rotation 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:57.129
 internal and external only by moving it 

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.620
 which is the hip to feel good 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.440
 activation of our gluteus we repeat 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.420
 equally 58 times we continue 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.650
 adding a series of variants going 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.400
 outside 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.830
 or back 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.180
 or also facing 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.150
 sometimes we also do it 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:20.050
 moving to the sides either 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.650
 walking from the left to the right or 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:25.980
 going down in this same position 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.349
 from left or right 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.940
 or we can also do it with pieces 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:31.819
 staggered taking steps to the front 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.709
 trying to maintain our position 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.720
 well aligned and good and it's the way to 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.819
 as we achieved the activation of 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.420
 our buttocks very important 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:44.280
 then we continue with what are the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.709
 integration of different movements by 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.840
 example in a movement like this I 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:50.069
 I put more or less of this profile to 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:51.720
 that reach me to see we start to 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.870
 raise your knees doing a 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.909
 little ski ping 

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:59.120
 and also making movement of 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.310
 scripting moving they face towards 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.379
 behind or even to the sides and 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.360
 finally we do what is already the 

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:07.849
 innervation of the movement doing 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:12.360
 movements like this quick contacts 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:15.210
 fast and intense movements like this 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.480
 Quick cuts 3 to 5 seconds or 

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:21.180
 including jumping fast contacts 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.740
 intense and this way is how 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.500
 we work with the games of the 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:27.870
 selection so they fit well but my 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.580
 activated either your training 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:32.020
 or the competition 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.270
 finally tell me what it means for 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:37.180
 you be part of the national team 

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:39.310

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.270
 illusion a great commitment can 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:48.040
