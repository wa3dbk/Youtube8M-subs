of the hardest spots to ever tank on

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.580 
of the hardest spots to ever tank on

the main she'll just get out and give
the<00:03:06.150> old<00:03:06.330> RPG<00:03:07.200> to<00:03:07.410> the<00:03:07.530> face<00:03:07.739> and<00:03:08.580> that's

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
the old RPG to the face and that's

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.220 
the old RPG to the face and that's
probably<00:03:08.910> the<00:03:09.150> best<00:03:09.270> thing<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.540> do<00:03:09.750> just<00:03:09.780> bait

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.230 
probably the best thing to do just bait

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:11.660 
probably the best thing to do just bait
them<00:03:10.470> into<00:03:10.590> that<00:03:10.830> sense<00:03:11.100> of<00:03:11.220> security<00:03:11.489> that

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
them into that sense of security that

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.150 
them into that sense of security that
they<00:03:11.820> can<00:03:12.000> make<00:03:12.120> a<00:03:12.150> long<00:03:12.510> straight<00:03:13.440> on<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:13.770> if

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
they can make a long straight on you if

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.010 
they can make a long straight on you if
it's<00:03:14.400> a<00:03:14.459> deep<00:03:14.670> strafe<00:03:15.120> they're<00:03:15.600> not<00:03:15.780> going<00:03:15.930> to

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
it's a deep strafe they're not going to

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.330 
it's a deep strafe they're not going to
be<00:03:16.080> able<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.320> be<00:03:16.410> on<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.650> very<00:03:16.860> long<00:03:17.070> but<00:03:17.250> if

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
be able to be on you very long but if

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.890 
be able to be on you very long but if
it's<00:03:17.489> a<00:03:17.580> shallow<00:03:17.820> strafe<00:03:18.180> like<00:03:18.330> that<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.750> can

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
it's a shallow strafe like that they can

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.840 
it's a shallow strafe like that they can
really<00:03:19.200> light<00:03:19.440> you<00:03:19.590> up<00:03:19.620> especially<00:03:19.980> if<00:03:20.310> you're

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
really light you up especially if you're

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.000 
really light you up especially if you're
a<00:03:20.880> PS<00:03:21.180> is<00:03:21.330> down<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.780> here's<00:03:22.410> where<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.739> enemy

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
a PS is down and here's where the enemy

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.220 
a PS is down and here's where the enemy
team<00:03:23.160> starts<00:03:23.489> wising<00:03:23.940> up<00:03:24.030> and<00:03:24.239> just<00:03:24.390> slamming

me with engineer spam support spam and

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.870 
me with engineer spam support spam and
of<00:03:28.230> course<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.709> Jeep<00:03:28.950> stuff<00:03:29.340> which<00:03:29.670> will<00:03:29.790> be

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
of course the Jeep stuff which will be

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.699 
of course the Jeep stuff which will be
making<00:03:30.030> a<00:03:30.239> couple<00:03:30.450> appearances<00:03:30.840> very<00:03:31.260> shortly

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
making a couple appearances very shortly

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:33.590 
making a couple appearances very shortly
now<00:03:31.920> let's<00:03:32.100> talk<00:03:32.220> about<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.580> HMG<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.420> why<00:03:33.570> I

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
now let's talk about the HMG and why I

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.210 
now let's talk about the HMG and why I
like<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:33.930> number<00:03:34.260> one<00:03:34.440> it<00:03:34.650> just<00:03:34.680> destroys

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
like it number one it just destroys

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.670 
like it number one it just destroys
infantry<00:03:35.820> at<00:03:36.000> range<00:03:36.480> but<00:03:36.840> think<00:03:37.590> about

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
infantry at range but think about

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.140 
infantry at range but think about
anything<00:03:38.010> that<00:03:38.220> can<00:03:38.340> hold<00:03:38.459> Jeep<00:03:38.730> stuff<00:03:39.000> on

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
anything that can hold Jeep stuff on

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.670 
anything that can hold Jeep stuff on
this<00:03:39.269> map<00:03:39.480> there's<00:03:39.720> quite<00:03:39.930> a<00:03:39.959> few<00:03:40.049> vehicles<00:03:40.320> it

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
this map there's quite a few vehicles it

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.949 
this map there's quite a few vehicles it
can<00:03:40.799> disable<00:03:41.400> them<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.000> could<00:03:42.180> kill<00:03:42.450> them<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
can disable them it could kill them and

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.320 
can disable them it could kill them and
it<00:03:43.769> could<00:03:43.980> be<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.549> final<00:03:44.820> blower<00:03:45.180> the

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
it could be the final blower the

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.660 
it could be the final blower the
starting<00:03:45.720> blow<00:03:45.900> so<00:03:46.170> I<00:03:46.200> switched<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.709> HMG<00:03:47.280> here

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
starting blow so I switched to HMG here

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.220 
starting blow so I switched to HMG here
and<00:03:48.120> I<00:03:48.209> am<00:03:48.239> gonna<00:03:48.390> finish<00:03:48.630> this<00:03:48.780> kill<00:03:48.989> no

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
and I am gonna finish this kill no

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.650 
and I am gonna finish this kill no

hitmarkers well it's empty I still want
to<00:03:51.750> kill<00:03:51.900> it<00:03:52.080> because<00:03:52.260> somebody<00:03:52.680> might<00:03:52.709> be

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
to kill it because somebody might be

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.650 
to kill it because somebody might be
pillar<00:03:53.370> in<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.640> they<00:03:53.790> might<00:03:53.970> be<00:03:54.180> hiding<00:03:54.390> behind

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
pillar in it they might be hiding behind

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.780 
pillar in it they might be hiding behind
it<00:03:54.989> an<00:03:55.350> explosive<00:03:55.769> damage<00:03:56.070> if<00:03:56.370> they're<00:03:56.519> really

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
it an explosive damage if they're really

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.490 
it an explosive damage if they're really
close<00:03:57.120> or<00:03:57.480> if<00:03:57.630> they're<00:03:57.780> hurt<00:03:57.930> and<00:03:58.170> a<00:03:58.320> little

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
close or if they're hurt and a little

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.009 
close or if they're hurt and a little
bit<00:03:58.590> distance<00:03:59.280> away<00:03:59.430> it<00:04:00.120> will<00:04:00.390> kill<00:04:00.660> them<00:04:00.840> and

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
bit distance away it will kill them and

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.080 
bit distance away it will kill them and
yet<00:04:01.500> again<00:04:01.620> we<00:04:01.860> have<00:04:01.950> another<00:04:02.190> tank<00:04:02.670> sneaking

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
yet again we have another tank sneaking

yet again we have another tank sneaking
up<00:04:03.239> so<00:04:03.390> I<00:04:03.420> need<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.840> find<00:04:04.049> some<00:04:04.260> cover<00:04:04.500> but<00:04:05.190> I'm

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
up so I need to find some cover but I'm

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.550 
up so I need to find some cover but I'm
going<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.459> take<00:04:05.549> one<00:04:05.610> more<00:04:06.000> shot<00:04:06.060> and<00:04:06.630> then<00:04:07.170> i'm

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
going to take one more shot and then i'm

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.320 
going to take one more shot and then i'm
going<00:04:07.680> to<00:04:07.739> use<00:04:07.920> what's<00:04:08.250> left<00:04:08.310> of<00:04:08.850> this

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
going to use what's left of this

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.509 
going to use what's left of this
building<00:04:09.870> which<00:04:10.410> this<00:04:10.769> whole<00:04:10.950> areas<00:04:11.310> is

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:11.519 
building which this whole areas is

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:13.699 
building which this whole areas is
simply<00:04:11.970> in<00:04:12.060> shambles<00:04:12.540> so<00:04:13.110> you'll<00:04:13.260> see<00:04:13.500> a<00:04:13.530> lot

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
simply in shambles so you'll see a lot

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.229 
simply in shambles so you'll see a lot
of<00:04:13.769> times<00:04:14.010> i<00:04:14.100> just<00:04:14.280> don't<00:04:14.579> stand<00:04:14.880> there<00:04:15.000> and

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:15.239 
of times i just don't stand there and

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:17.630 
of times i just don't stand there and
shoot<00:04:15.510> the<00:04:16.200> reason<00:04:16.560> why<00:04:16.709> is<00:04:16.769> i<00:04:17.100> don't<00:04:17.430> want<00:04:17.549> to

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:17.640 
shoot the reason why is i don't want to

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.759 
shoot the reason why is i don't want to
be<00:04:17.669> an<00:04:17.820> easy<00:04:17.970> target<00:04:18.269> a<00:04:18.660> moving<00:04:19.260> target<00:04:19.410> is<00:04:19.739> a

be an easy target a moving target is a

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.590 
be an easy target a moving target is a
lot<00:04:20.100> harder<00:04:20.280> hit<00:04:20.640> than<00:04:20.669> an<00:04:21.150> easy<00:04:21.299> target

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
lot harder hit than an easy target

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.750 
lot harder hit than an easy target

take my shot I hit like a truck and
here's<00:04:49.409> more<00:04:49.590> Jeep<00:04:49.830> stuff<00:04:50.099> I<00:04:50.250> could<00:04:50.430> stick

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
here's more Jeep stuff I could stick

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:53.240 
here's more Jeep stuff I could stick
with<00:04:50.759> the<00:04:50.819> HMG<00:04:51.180> but<00:04:51.659> of<00:04:51.750> course<00:04:51.990> the<00:04:52.680> primary

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
with the HMG but of course the primary

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.490 
with the HMG but of course the primary
just<00:04:53.490> makes<00:04:53.669> it<00:04:53.789> so<00:04:54.000> much<00:04:54.240> more<00:04:54.360> pretty<00:04:55.080> and

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
just makes it so much more pretty and

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.820 
just makes it so much more pretty and
then<00:04:56.219> more<00:04:56.550> dramatic<00:04:57.300> right<00:04:57.659> so<00:04:58.319> pulling<00:04:58.680> back

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
then more dramatic right so pulling back

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.010 
then more dramatic right so pulling back
up<00:04:59.039> because<00:04:59.370> they<00:04:59.669> are<00:04:59.849> unburned<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.629> I<00:05:00.810> want

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
can never move your infantry can advance

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.089

and if your infantry can't advance you

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:49.459 
and if your infantry can't advance you
most<00:05:47.339> certainly<00:05:47.430> cannot<00:05:48.300> advance<00:05:48.599> remember

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
most certainly cannot advance remember

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:51.320 
most certainly cannot advance remember
again<00:05:49.740> a<00:05:49.979> piece<00:05:50.520> of<00:05:50.550> armor<00:05:50.909> is<00:05:51.000> only<00:05:51.150> as<00:05:51.300> strong

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.330 
again a piece of armor is only as strong

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.240 
again a piece of armor is only as strong
as<00:05:51.539> the<00:05:51.750> infantry<00:05:52.139> around<00:05:52.409> it<00:05:52.589> and<00:05:52.680> they<00:05:53.009> most

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
as the infantry around it and they most

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:55.010 
as the infantry around it and they most
certainly<00:05:53.370> complement<00:05:54.150> each<00:05:54.180> other<00:05:54.419> as<00:05:54.629> more

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:55.020 
certainly complement each other as more

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:56.719 
certainly complement each other as more
Jeep<00:05:55.289> stuff<00:05:55.589> makes<00:05:56.039> the<00:05:56.159> parents<00:05:56.580> and<00:05:56.699> I

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
Jeep stuff makes the parents and I

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.490 
Jeep stuff makes the parents and I
actually<00:05:56.849> had<00:05:57.089> to<00:05:57.120> back<00:05:57.449> off<00:05:57.659> d<00:05:57.930> that's<00:05:58.259> how

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:58.500 
actually had to back off d that's how

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:00.619 
actually had to back off d that's how
hot<00:05:58.830> it<00:05:58.979> got<00:05:59.159> because<00:05:59.550> you<00:06:00.000> never<00:06:00.240> want<00:06:00.569> to

00:06:00.619 --> 00:06:00.629 
hot it got because you never want to

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:03.019 
hot it got because you never want to
split<00:06:01.080> the<00:06:01.949> enemies<00:06:02.339> and<00:06:02.580> that's<00:06:02.789> what's

00:06:03.019 --> 00:06:03.029 
split the enemies and that's what's

00:06:03.029 --> 00:06:04.519 
split the enemies and that's what's
happening<00:06:03.389> there<00:06:03.569> they<00:06:03.750> got<00:06:03.900> on<00:06:04.020> my<00:06:04.110> right<00:06:04.349> and

00:06:04.519 --> 00:06:04.529 
happening there they got on my right and

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:06.170 
happening there they got on my right and
they<00:06:04.949> got<00:06:05.129> on<00:06:05.250> my<00:06:05.370> left<00:06:05.610> even<00:06:05.940> though<00:06:06.060> the

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:06.180 
they got on my left even though the

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.089 
they got on my left even though the
turret<00:06:06.449> speed<00:06:06.690> is<00:06:06.810> quicker<00:06:07.110> on<00:06:07.319> PC<00:06:07.710> than<00:06:07.889> it<00:06:07.979> is

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
turret speed is quicker on PC than it is

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.519 
turret speed is quicker on PC than it is
on<00:06:08.129> console<00:06:08.819> it's<00:06:09.089> really<00:06:09.870> hard<00:06:10.139> if<00:06:10.289> you<00:06:10.379> got

00:06:10.519 --> 00:06:10.529 
on console it's really hard if you got

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:12.050 
on console it's really hard if you got
enemies<00:06:10.949> all<00:06:11.129> around<00:06:11.159> you<00:06:11.550> and<00:06:11.699> there<00:06:11.819> you<00:06:11.909> see

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:12.060 
enemies all around you and there you see

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.600 
enemies all around you and there you see
two<00:06:12.389> different<00:06:12.539> locks<00:06:12.930> not<00:06:13.860> just<00:06:14.099> a<00:06:14.190> handheld

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
two different locks not just a handheld

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.640 
two different locks not just a handheld
but<00:06:14.849> maybe<00:06:15.029> a<00:06:15.120> pld<00:06:15.479> up<00:06:15.750> on<00:06:15.870> a<00:06:15.930> tower<00:06:16.139> which

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:16.650 
but maybe a pld up on a tower which

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.200 
but maybe a pld up on a tower which
could<00:06:16.830> be<00:06:16.889> very<00:06:17.129> problematic<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:17.849> me<00:06:17.969> along

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
could be very problematic for me along

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.019 
could be very problematic for me along
with<00:06:18.389> another<00:06:18.629> a<00:06:18.930> TV<00:06:19.289> so<00:06:19.469> I'm<00:06:19.589> going<00:06:19.770> to<00:06:19.830> CD<00:06:20.460> I'm

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
with another a TV so I'm going to CD I'm

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.490 
with another a TV so I'm going to CD I'm
going<00:06:21.180> to<00:06:21.240> give<00:06:21.539> it<00:06:21.569> to<00:06:21.690> them<00:06:21.960> because<00:06:22.199> it's

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
going to give it to them because it's

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.640 
going to give it to them because it's
just<00:06:23.069> too<00:06:23.669> hot<00:06:23.940> if<00:06:24.270> you're<00:06:24.930> surrounded<00:06:25.500> it's

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:25.650 
just too hot if you're surrounded it's

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:28.189 
just too hot if you're surrounded it's
just<00:06:25.889> too<00:06:26.039> much<00:06:26.279> for<00:06:26.699> you<00:06:26.879> as<00:06:27.060> a<00:06:27.089> primary<00:06:27.449> then

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:28.199 
just too much for you as a primary then

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:30.260 
just too much for you as a primary then
of<00:06:28.319> course<00:06:28.560> your<00:06:29.009> gunner<00:06:29.279> there<00:06:29.610> is<00:06:29.789> no<00:06:30.000> safe

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:30.270 
of course your gunner there is no safe

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:32.180 
of course your gunner there is no safe
side<00:06:30.539> repair<00:06:30.990> there<00:06:31.169> is<00:06:31.319> no<00:06:31.500> safe<00:06:31.740> spot<00:06:31.770> to

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
side repair there is no safe spot to

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.430 
side repair there is no safe spot to
backup<00:06:32.639> but<00:06:33.270> I<00:06:33.300> don't<00:06:33.599> want<00:06:33.839> them<00:06:34.020> to<00:06:34.139> keep

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
backup but I don't want them to keep

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.409 
backup but I don't want them to keep
deep<00:06:34.800> so<00:06:35.399> we're<00:06:35.490> going<00:06:35.580> to<00:06:35.669> try<00:06:35.729> to<00:06:35.789> make<00:06:36.000> one

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:36.419 
deep so we're going to try to make one

00:06:36.419 --> 00:06:38.990 
deep so we're going to try to make one
last<00:06:36.690> pass<00:06:37.020> at<00:06:37.319> this<00:06:37.560> maybe<00:06:38.339> take<00:06:38.669> a<00:06:38.729> couple

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:39.000 
last pass at this maybe take a couple

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.850 
last pass at this maybe take a couple
guys<00:06:39.209> down<00:06:39.539> and<00:06:39.839> this<00:06:40.199> is<00:06:40.319> another<00:06:40.500> nice

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:40.860 
guys down and this is another nice

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:41.150 
guys down and this is another nice
little

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
little

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.830 
little
I<00:06:41.190> like<00:06:41.610> to<00:06:41.730> get<00:06:41.850> to<00:06:42.030> if<00:06:42.210> they<00:06:42.270> start<00:06:42.780> getting

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:42.840 
I like to get to if they start getting

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:44.660 
I like to get to if they start getting
up<00:06:43.170> in<00:06:43.320> this<00:06:43.410> hill<00:06:43.650> and<00:06:43.860> you<00:06:44.160> don't<00:06:44.400> have<00:06:44.550> the

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:44.670 
up in this hill and you don't have the

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:47.390 
up in this hill and you don't have the
infantry<00:06:45.120> support<00:06:45.510> just<00:06:46.230> back<00:06:46.380> up<00:06:46.620> then<00:06:47.280> you

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
infantry support just back up then you

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:49.550 
infantry support just back up then you
have<00:06:47.610> somewhat<00:06:48.390> of<00:06:48.420> an<00:06:48.660> angle<00:06:48.900> from<00:06:49.080> them<00:06:49.320> and

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:49.560 
have somewhat of an angle from them and

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:50.930 
have somewhat of an angle from them and
then<00:06:49.890> of<00:06:49.980> course<00:06:50.010> if<00:06:50.310> your<00:06:50.430> infantry<00:06:50.790> are

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:50.940 
then of course if your infantry are

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:52.430 
then of course if your infantry are
pushing<00:06:51.360> on<00:06:51.450> the<00:06:51.480> right<00:06:51.720> they<00:06:51.960> can't<00:06:52.200> step

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
pushing on the right they can't step

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:54.290 
pushing on the right they can't step
over<00:06:52.710> the<00:06:52.830> hill<00:06:53.040> they're<00:06:53.670> just<00:06:53.700> going<00:06:54.090> to<00:06:54.150> get

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:54.300 
over the hill they're just going to get

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.880 
over the hill they're just going to get
shot<00:06:54.330> help<00:06:54.810> develop<00:06:55.200> those<00:06:55.320> cross<00:06:55.560> by<00:06:55.770> your

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:55.890 
shot help develop those cross by your

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.460 
shot help develop those cross by your
angles<00:06:56.190> so<00:06:56.340> I<00:06:56.520> repair<00:06:57.270> we<00:06:57.630> still<00:06:57.900> don't<00:06:58.020> have<00:06:58.140> D

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
angles so I repair we still don't have D

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.260 
angles so I repair we still don't have D
but<00:06:58.740> we're<00:06:58.920> kind<00:06:59.220> of<00:06:59.310> in<00:06:59.430> a<00:06:59.520> comfortable<00:06:59.850> lead

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
but we're kind of in a comfortable lead

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:03.170 
but we're kind of in a comfortable lead
here<00:07:00.570> just<00:07:01.140> sticky<00:07:01.380> with<00:07:01.500> the<00:07:01.560> HMG<00:07:02.180> aps

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
here just sticky with the HMG aps

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.230 
here just sticky with the HMG aps
because<00:07:03.660> it's<00:07:03.960> a<00:07:04.050> pile<00:07:04.230> of<00:07:04.410> NGS<00:07:04.830> maybe<00:07:05.820> didn't

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:06.240 
because it's a pile of NGS maybe didn't

00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.880 
because it's a pile of NGS maybe didn't
need<00:07:06.360> it<00:07:06.480> there<00:07:06.690> might<00:07:07.320> have<00:07:07.350> saved<00:07:07.650> my<00:07:07.860> ass

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:07.890 
need it there might have saved my ass

00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:09.470 
need it there might have saved my ass
here<00:07:08.370> in<00:07:08.460> a<00:07:08.520> couple<00:07:08.640> seconds<00:07:09.120> but<00:07:09.270> whenever

00:07:09.470 --> 00:07:09.480 
here in a couple seconds but whenever

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.150 
here in a couple seconds but whenever
you<00:07:09.720> see<00:07:09.900> a<00:07:09.930> pile<00:07:10.230> of<00:07:10.260> energies<00:07:10.770> or<00:07:10.800> you're

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:11.160 
you see a pile of energies or you're

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:13.670 
you see a pile of energies or you're
coming<00:07:11.460> onto<00:07:11.730> a<00:07:11.760> flag<00:07:12.090> where<00:07:12.870> they<00:07:13.290> just<00:07:13.530> took

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:13.680 
coming onto a flag where they just took

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.990 
coming onto a flag where they just took
it<00:07:13.740> with<00:07:13.980> a<00:07:14.010> pile<00:07:14.250> of<00:07:14.400> energies<00:07:14.700> it<00:07:14.820> just

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:15.000 
it with a pile of energies it just

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.140 
it with a pile of energies it just
forced<00:07:15.300> you<00:07:15.420> off<00:07:15.600> of<00:07:15.630> it<00:07:16.370> pre-fire<00:07:17.370> that<00:07:17.790> aps

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.150 
forced you off of it pre-fire that aps

00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:19.670 
forced you off of it pre-fire that aps
what's<00:07:18.900> the<00:07:18.990> worst<00:07:19.200> thing<00:07:19.350> that<00:07:19.530> can<00:07:19.620> happen

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:19.680 
what's the worst thing that can happen

00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.710 
what's the worst thing that can happen
right<00:07:20.310> you're<00:07:20.490> going<00:07:20.580> to<00:07:20.670> survive<00:07:20.940> now<00:07:21.660> the
