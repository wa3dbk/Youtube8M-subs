00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:05.030
 That is also true 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:10.970
 It is a great luxury is like like in the ship 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:15.100

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:20.270

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:12.330
 If you look at this world map, Layton should immediately know the destination of this airship 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:12.330

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:26.640

 We took off in flight ship No. Bosutoniasu order to elucidate the mystery of the living mummy 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:22.330
 It was the beginning of a tremendous journey that crossed the world 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.590
 And this is 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:28.210
