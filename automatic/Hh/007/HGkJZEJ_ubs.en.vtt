00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.609
 finally with this 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.969
 long 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.969
 and they have a part 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.870
 has a part that is not to fly and another 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.660
 part that is polar 

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.690
 then this part that is polar have 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.560
 affinity for polar substances 

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.810
 mainly the one that we have 

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:37.320
 usually everywhere and in 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.530
 our body the water 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.579
 then this water molecule in this 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.160
 negative charge density and good this 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.720
 polar molecule that thanks solvent 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.240
 and all the reactions that occur in 

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.140
 our body 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:57.510
 this eye head will be in order to have 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.920
 affinity with this and this part do not slip 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.920
 tend to hide 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.570
 with another molecule of this type 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.900
 when then hide this 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.900
 side 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.310
 happy 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:28.040
 that has something here inside and something of 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.040
 outside and that gives rise to the cells 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.909
 this entry 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.530
 which will later be 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.530
 will become a cell because it serves me 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.750
 inside that watery medium in a bus 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.170
 outside or inside but I have to 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 I have an access membrane that allows 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.710
 that inside of me outside of the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:55.700
 concentrations of the different 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.700
 of substances
