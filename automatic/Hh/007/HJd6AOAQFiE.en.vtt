00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
around with the KSG 12 and this gun is

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.060 
around with the KSG 12 and this gun is
actually<00:00:19.289> all<00:00:19.410> right<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.710> pretty<00:00:19.920> good

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
actually all right it's pretty good

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.210 
actually all right it's pretty good
without<00:00:20.910> any<00:00:21.090> attachments<00:00:21.660> I<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.750> did<00:00:22.680> once<00:00:22.949> get

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
without any attachments I I did once get

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.160 
without any attachments I I did once get
extended<00:00:23.820> mags<00:00:24.060> into<00:00:24.300> one<00:00:24.510> prestige<00:00:24.720> and<00:00:25.080> then

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
extended mags into one prestige and then

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.290 
extended mags into one prestige and then
I<00:00:25.199> you<00:00:25.650> know<00:00:25.740> prestige<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.369> i<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.180> this

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
I you know prestige but i think this

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.670 
I you know prestige but i think this
weapon<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.720> actually<00:00:28.050> one<00:00:28.170> of<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.289> best<00:00:28.500> shot

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
weapon is actually one of the best shot

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.099 
weapon is actually one of the best shot
guns<00:00:28.890> without<00:00:29.039> any<00:00:29.490> attachments<00:00:30.090> but<00:00:30.269> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
guns without any attachments but it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.080 
guns without any attachments but it
still<00:00:31.439> can<00:00:31.590> be<00:00:31.619> pretty<00:00:32.070> inconsistent<00:00:32.460> getting

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
still can be pretty inconsistent getting

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.310 
still can be pretty inconsistent getting
a<00:00:33.180> lot<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> hit<00:00:33.510> markers<00:00:33.840> and<00:00:33.960> stuff<00:00:34.020> like<00:00:34.260> that

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
a lot of hit markers and stuff like that

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.350 
a lot of hit markers and stuff like that
but<00:00:34.680> if<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.550> look<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> the<00:00:35.880> bottom<00:00:36.090> right<00:00:36.329> hand

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
but if you look in the bottom right hand

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.970 
but if you look in the bottom right hand
corner<00:00:36.570> you'll<00:00:36.899> see<00:00:36.960> that<00:00:37.260> you<00:00:37.649> know<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:37.950> looks

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
corner you'll see that you know it looks

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.440 
corner you'll see that you know it looks
like<00:00:38.309> there<00:00:38.489> is<00:00:38.520> extended<00:00:38.969> mags<00:00:39.120> on<00:00:39.300> this

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
like there is extended mags on this

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.330 
like there is extended mags on this
weapon<00:00:39.629> because<00:00:40.079> i<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.770> has<00:00:40.890> like<00:00:41.070> 12

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
weapon because i think it has like 12

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.889 
weapon because i think it has like 12
bolts<00:00:41.670> start<00:00:41.969> out<00:00:42.120> with<00:00:42.239> or<00:00:42.390> something<00:00:42.660> crazy

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
bolts start out with or something crazy

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.500 
bolts start out with or something crazy
like<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.230> but<00:00:43.670> because<00:00:44.670> of<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.120> high<00:00:45.239> clip

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
like that but because of the high clip

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.760 
like that but because of the high clip
you<00:00:45.629> don't<00:00:45.780> really<00:00:45.899> need<00:00:46.050> to<00:00:46.200> use<00:00:46.320> extended

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
you don't really need to use extended

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.110 
you don't really need to use extended
mags<00:00:46.950> unless<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.550> for<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> extra

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
mags unless you're going for that extra

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.389 
mags unless you're going for that extra
damage<00:00:48.360> boost<00:00:48.780> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:49.710> here<00:00:50.100> on<00:00:50.250> way

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
damage boost which is still here on way

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:51.590 
damage boost which is still here on way
i<00:00:50.430> think<00:00:50.730> they<00:00:50.820> patch<00:00:51.059> it<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.300> the<00:00:51.449> other

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
i think they patch it in the other

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.450 
i think they patch it in the other
systems<00:00:52.050> which<00:00:52.530> is<00:00:52.680> kind<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.949> funny<00:00:53.010> i<00:00:53.219> guess

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
systems which is kind of funny i guess

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.700 
systems which is kind of funny i guess
that's<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.820> perk<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:54.809> having<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.230> patch<00:00:55.469> and

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
that's a perk to not having a patch and

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.619 
that's a perk to not having a patch and
so<00:00:55.829> long<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.309> that<00:00:56.610> they're<00:00:56.940> still<00:00:57.120> damage<00:00:57.480> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
so long is that they're still damage on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
so long is that they're still damage on
our<00:00:57.750> shotgun<00:00:58.170> when<00:00:58.410> put<00:00:58.739> extended<00:00:59.160> mags<00:00:59.309> on

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
our shotgun when put extended mags on

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.650 
our shotgun when put extended mags on
and<00:00:59.730> stuff<00:00:59.879> like<00:01:00.000> that<00:01:00.059> but<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.510> pretty

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
and stuff like that but that's pretty

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.229 
and stuff like that but that's pretty
funny<00:01:00.899> so<00:01:01.399> anyway<00:01:02.399> guys<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:02.730> using<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.030> here

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
funny so anyway guys we're using it here

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.000 
funny so anyway guys we're using it here
with<00:01:03.449> no<00:01:03.629> attachments<00:01:04.140> maybe<00:01:04.290> a<00:01:04.379> grip<00:01:04.619> I<00:01:04.769> think

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
with no attachments maybe a grip I think

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.219 
with no attachments maybe a grip I think
and<00:01:05.280> you<00:01:06.240> know<00:01:06.360> it's<00:01:06.479> actually<00:01:06.810> kind<00:01:06.990> of<00:01:07.020> funny

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
and you know it's actually kind of funny

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:08.929 
and you know it's actually kind of funny
is<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.920> this<00:01:08.250> shotgun<00:01:08.520> actually

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
is that this this shotgun actually

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
is that this this shotgun actually
reminded<00:01:09.240> me<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.390> an<00:01:09.540> under<00:01:09.780> barrel<00:01:10.110> shotgun

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
reminded me of an under barrel shotgun

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.679 
reminded me of an under barrel shotgun
from<00:01:10.860> you<00:01:11.640> know<00:01:11.760> like<00:01:12.090> on<00:01:12.240> an<00:01:12.360> assault<00:01:12.600> rifle

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
from you know like on an assault rifle

or something like that it kind of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
or something like that it kind of
reloads<00:01:15.990> the<00:01:16.170> same<00:01:16.380> way<00:01:16.530> I'm<00:01:16.799> not<00:01:17.070> reload<00:01:17.340> the

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490

are<00:01:32.520> pretty<00:01:32.759> old<00:01:32.939> i<00:01:33.119> think<00:01:33.299> from<00:01:33.540> at<00:01:33.689> least<00:01:33.810> a

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
are pretty old i think from at least a

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.069 
are pretty old i think from at least a
month<00:01:34.340> not<00:01:35.340> quite<00:01:35.549> sure<00:01:35.579> though<00:01:35.909> but<00:01:36.390> these

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
month not quite sure though but these

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.649 
month not quite sure though but these
were<00:01:37.259> when<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.460> FM<00:01:38.729> geez<00:01:38.909> weren't<00:01:39.180> as<00:01:39.299> hated

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
were when the FM geez weren't as hated

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.270 
were when the FM geez weren't as hated
as<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.900> are<00:01:40.020> now<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.950> know<00:01:41.070> they<00:01:41.220> were

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
as they are now but you know they were

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.910 
as they are now but you know they were
never<00:01:41.520> loved<00:01:42.450> by<00:01:42.750> anyone<00:01:43.020> but<00:01:43.320> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> they

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
never loved by anyone but you know they

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.950 
never loved by anyone but you know they
were<00:01:43.979> never<00:01:44.250> as<00:01:44.399> hated<00:01:44.729> as<00:01:44.909> now<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.750> guess

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
were never as hated as now and I guess

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.550 
were never as hated as now and I guess
but<00:01:46.340> basically<00:01:47.340> i<00:01:47.700> only<00:01:48.210> use<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.540> fmg9<00:01:48.810> s<00:01:49.350> when

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
but basically i only use the fmg9 s when

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.969 
but basically i only use the fmg9 s when
a<00:01:49.860> one<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.570> two<00:01:51.570> things<00:01:51.600> is<00:01:52.110> when<00:01:52.619> I'm<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.950> of

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
a one of two things is when I'm out of

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:56.630 
a one of two things is when I'm out of
ammo<00:01:53.250> my<00:01:53.549> primary<00:01:54.000> weapon<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:54.590> when<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.979> mean

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
ammo my primary weapon and when I mean

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.060 
ammo my primary weapon and when I mean
like<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.880> risky<00:01:57.360> or<00:01:57.509> you<00:01:58.079> know<00:01:58.200> close<00:01:58.500> situation

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
like a risky or you know close situation

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.170 
like a risky or you know close situation
and<00:01:59.250> I<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.460> really<00:01:59.549> want<00:01:59.790> to<00:01:59.820> die<00:01:59.969> you'll

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180

maybe a live stream rather than buy a
t-shirt<00:06:37.750> or<00:06:38.080> something<00:06:38.169> like<00:06:38.440> that<00:06:38.700> that

00:07:03.210 --> 00:07:03.220 
end up doing this so I just thought that

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:04.410 
end up doing this so I just thought that
would<00:07:03.430> be<00:07:03.460> a<00:07:03.550> little<00:07:03.760> cool<00:07:03.970> thing<00:07:04.120> to<00:07:04.150> do<00:07:04.390> for
