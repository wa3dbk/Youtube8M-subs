00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.740 
it three times a week which is crazy but
like<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.979> second<00:02:02.399> it<00:02:02.490> would<00:02:02.579> chip<00:02:02.909> um<00:02:03.149> I<00:02:03.600> would

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
but I've gotten better to the fact it's

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.500

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
like you can't just put on one swipe and

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.210

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
which is a little bit annoying but I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.659 
which is a little bit annoying but I
think<00:03:46.109> the<00:03:46.230> color<00:03:46.470> is<00:03:46.560> just<00:03:46.889> beautiful<00:03:47.310> anyway

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:49.580 
think the color is just beautiful anyway
and<00:03:47.849> the<00:03:47.910> finish<00:03:48.180> is<00:03:48.329> really<00:03:48.359> nice<00:03:48.750> so<00:03:49.079> I<00:03:49.260> think

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
and the finish is really nice so I think

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.599 
and the finish is really nice so I think
it's<00:03:49.799> super<00:03:50.099> pretty<00:03:50.129> Matt<00:03:50.819> nails<00:03:51.090> in<00:03:51.389> or<00:03:51.870> out

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
at the top as most people and then it's

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.410 
at the top as most people and then it's
just<00:04:45.250> like<00:04:45.370> all<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.580> wife's<00:04:45.820> gone<00:04:46.030> you<00:04:46.210> just

have like this clear nail polish on so
it's<00:04:48.430> kind<00:04:48.610> of<00:04:48.670> pointless<00:04:48.820> but<00:04:49.450> it<00:04:49.540> see<00:04:49.630> a<00:04:49.660> fake

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:49.930

nails<00:04:50.170> I<00:04:50.320> think<00:04:50.470> they<00:04:50.560> look<00:04:50.680> so<00:04:51.010> pretty<00:04:51.220> I

nails I think they look so pretty I

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:53.010 
nails I think they look so pretty I
always<00:04:51.670> get<00:04:51.790> them<00:04:51.940> for<00:04:51.970> prom<00:04:52.360> season<00:04:52.690> and

always get them for prom season and

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.770 
always get them for prom season and
