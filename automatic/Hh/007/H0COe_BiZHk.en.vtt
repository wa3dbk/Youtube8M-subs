China's<00:00:23.210> are<00:00:23.420> an<00:00:24.380> interesting<00:00:24.680> track<00:00:25.100> of<00:00:25.250> who

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
China's are an interesting track of who

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.429 
China's are an interesting track of who
could<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.150> mixture<00:00:26.420> of<00:00:26.570> corners<00:00:26.990> I<00:00:27.140> mean<00:00:27.290> their

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
could a mixture of corners I mean their

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.200 
could a mixture of corners I mean their
selfie<00:00:27.770> that<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.279> very<00:00:28.490> long<00:00:28.700> low<00:00:28.910> speed

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
selfie that the very long low speed

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.909 
selfie that the very long low speed
corners<00:00:29.240> at<00:00:29.750> the<00:00:29.779> staff<00:00:30.110> of<00:00:30.349> the<00:00:30.410> lab<00:00:30.590> a

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:30.919 
corners at the staff of the lab a

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:32.740 
corners at the staff of the lab a
mixture<00:00:31.669> of<00:00:31.730> high<00:00:31.880> speed<00:00:32.210> corners<00:00:32.540> in<00:00:32.660> the

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:32.750 
mixture of high speed corners in the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:34.090 
mixture of high speed corners in the
middle<00:00:32.989> and<00:00:33.140> then<00:00:33.230> obviously<00:00:33.379> in<00:00:33.590> a<00:00:33.650> very<00:00:33.680> very

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
middle and then obviously in a very very

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.900 
middle and then obviously in a very very
long<00:00:34.250> straight

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
long straight

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.299 
long straight
that's<00:00:35.780> like<00:00:35.900> 1.3<00:00:36.530> kilometers<00:00:37.010> worth<00:00:37.190> a

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:37.309 
that's like 1.3 kilometers worth a

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.860 
that's like 1.3 kilometers worth a
straight<00:00:37.580> where<00:00:37.879> obviously<00:00:38.420> you<00:00:38.629> need<00:00:38.750> to

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
straight where obviously you need to

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.750 
straight where obviously you need to
fine-tune<00:00:39.140> the<00:00:39.410> car<00:00:39.680> for<00:00:39.860> speed<00:00:40.100> I<00:00:40.400> mean

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
fine-tune the car for speed I mean

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.610 
fine-tune the car for speed I mean
normally<00:00:41.390> there<00:00:41.600> you<00:00:41.750> end<00:00:41.900> up<00:00:42.050> finding<00:00:42.350> you

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
normally there you end up finding you

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.619 
normally there you end up finding you
run<00:00:42.800> towards<00:00:43.160> more<00:00:43.340> and<00:00:43.610> more<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.150> top<00:00:44.330> end<00:00:44.510> of

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:44.629 
run towards more and more the top end of

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.140 
run towards more and more the top end of
the<00:00:44.720> downforce<00:00:45.110> range<00:00:45.440> but<00:00:46.129> I'm<00:00:46.250> sure<00:00:46.489> you

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
the downforce range but I'm sure you

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.060 
the downforce range but I'm sure you
know<00:00:47.300> with<00:00:47.930> that<00:00:48.080> straight<00:00:48.470> you<00:00:48.650> know<00:00:48.739> the

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
know with that straight you know the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.770 
know with that straight you know the
taking<00:00:49.519> is<00:00:49.640> going<00:00:49.730> to<00:00:49.879> be<00:00:50.030> you<00:00:50.570> know<00:00:50.629> that's

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
taking is going to be you know that's

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.479 
taking is going to be you know that's
your<00:00:50.930> one<00:00:51.050> overtaking<00:00:51.620> opportunity<00:00:52.129> really

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:52.489 
your one overtaking opportunity really

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:54.459 
your one overtaking opportunity really
so<00:00:52.730> I'm<00:00:53.270> sure<00:00:53.510> we're<00:00:53.690> all<00:00:53.719> be<00:00:53.930> looking<00:00:54.079> at

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
so I'm sure we're all be looking at

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.229 
so I'm sure we're all be looking at
trying<00:00:54.800> to<00:00:54.890> trade<00:00:55.129> our<00:00:55.340> speed<00:00:55.610> to<00:00:55.640> make<00:00:56.000> sure

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
trying to trade our speed to make sure

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.840 
trying to trade our speed to make sure
we<00:00:56.870> can<00:00:56.989> attack<00:00:57.289> and<00:00:57.500> defend<00:00:57.829> I<00:00:58.129> mean<00:00:58.700> we

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
we can attack and defend I mean we

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.490 
we can attack and defend I mean we
obviously<00:00:59.059> working<00:00:59.570> as<00:00:59.660> hard<00:00:59.809> as<00:00:59.930> we<00:00:59.989> can<00:01:00.289> to

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
obviously working as hard as we can to

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.770 
obviously working as hard as we can to
you<00:01:01.340> know<00:01:01.370> close<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:01.940> gap<00:01:02.090> to<00:01:02.270> the<00:01:02.300> top<00:01:02.510> teams

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
you know close the gap to the top teams

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.749 
you know close the gap to the top teams
obviously<00:01:03.110> Mercedes<00:01:03.770> have<00:01:03.920> a<00:01:03.949> reasonable

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
obviously Mercedes have a reasonable

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.609 
obviously Mercedes have a reasonable
lead<00:01:04.940> on<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.899> you<00:01:06.020> know<00:01:06.080> the<00:01:06.229> rest<00:01:06.410> of<00:01:06.530> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
lead on the you know the rest of the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.430 
lead on the you know the rest of the
field<00:01:06.880> we're<00:01:07.880> in<00:01:08.000> a<00:01:08.060> month's<00:01:08.300> fighting<00:01:08.810> of<00:01:09.170> a

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
field we're in a month's fighting of a

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.170 
field we're in a month's fighting of a
thought<00:01:09.770> for<00:01:09.979> there<00:01:10.100> you<00:01:10.759> know<00:01:10.820> there's<00:01:11.030> the

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
thought for there you know there's the

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.120 
thought for there you know there's the
second-best<00:01:11.600> team<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.110> that's<00:01:12.289> where<00:01:12.530> you

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130 
second-best team so that's where you

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:14.380 
second-best team so that's where you
know<00:01:13.220> our<00:01:13.340> concentration<00:01:14.060> is<00:01:14.149> with

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
know our concentration is with

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.109 
know our concentration is with
developing<00:01:15.020> a<00:01:15.110> car<00:01:15.289> you<00:01:15.979> know<00:01:16.070> every<00:01:16.759> part<00:01:17.000> of

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
developing a car you know every part of

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.170 
developing a car you know every part of
the<00:01:17.240> car<00:01:17.420> when<00:01:17.690> you<00:01:17.750> have<00:01:17.869> power<00:01:18.080> unit<00:01:18.500> Aero

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
the car when you have power unit Aero

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.639 
the car when you have power unit Aero
suspension<00:01:20.180> all<00:01:20.330> or<00:01:20.810> every<00:01:21.289> area<00:01:21.470> is

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:21.649 
suspension all or every area is

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.559 
suspension all or every area is
important<00:01:22.220> and<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:22.459> try<00:01:22.640> to<00:01:22.670> maximize<00:01:22.970> what<00:01:23.270> we

00:01:23.559 --> 00:01:23.569 
important and we try to maximize what we

00:01:23.569 --> 00:01:26.260 
important and we try to maximize what we
can<00:01:23.780> to<00:01:24.440> make<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.770> bigger<00:01:25.160> step<00:01:25.429> as<00:01:25.610> we<00:01:25.759> can<00:01:25.970> for

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
can to make a bigger step as we can for

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.110 
can to make a bigger step as we can for
each<00:01:26.479> and<00:01:26.720> every<00:01:26.869> race

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.120 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.820

development<00:03:33.180> we<00:03:33.269> then<00:03:33.420> try<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.690> analyze<00:03:34.260> these

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
development we then try to analyze these

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.350 
development we then try to analyze these

and hence give a car to the driver that

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.990 
and hence give a car to the driver that
makes<00:03:38.610> him<00:03:38.760> feel<00:03:38.880> more<00:03:39.060> confident<00:03:39.510> hence

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
makes him feel more confident hence

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.510 
makes him feel more confident hence
faster
