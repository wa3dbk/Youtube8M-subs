00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.870
 Today a small part of the winter 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.590
 fashion for men and for women because of that 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.910
 a general around so to speak 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.519
 Orientation against colors and steals and 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.830
 then I show you my bags caps 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:28.500
 So to speak, my show must have 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.090

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.099
 Hope you will like it so can 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.809
 Just me directly with the colors 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.280
 in the fashion try most of the time 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:38.010
 For example, to distribute winter 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.750
 I have the bot or tomato the bear 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.489
 is somewhat friendlier is bordeaux 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.210
 Clearly a tomatis now too 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.219
 totally in 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 I know a very noticeable dad 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.430
 but you can sometimes do something like that 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.670
 dare to trust and then there are still so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.960
 be that other camp is that he indeed 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 training camp these other the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.520
 direction and that what this money cognac 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.649
 or so fir fir this recharge 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.440
 cognac in things for shoes or bags 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.510
 Holiday leather jackets and mustard is currently 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.700
 very popular in things poses or too 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.500
 sweater and of course the whole thing 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.240
 it was black gray but thought 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.860
 most end be used to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.049
 just let the colors proposals 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.299
 or something I have about it 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.810
 my video making is once 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.420
 infobox 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.939
 and to come now is this winter 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.189
 There are actually five big style 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.320
 I would now roughly speaking it in 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.909
 a totally new but it 's actually 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.640
 I do not think so 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 and then something old and simple 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.020
 something like known searches that totally 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.170
 new somehow totally happy and though 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.210
 this is due to this god 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.780
 so this with doc martens and everywhere 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.119
 see field as if 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.250
 it is quite often black fur 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.590
 offer up here or in the 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.540
 general west and that's why 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.610
 so the people say now totally so 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.590
 long coats also trench coats in colors 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.930
 like black or like me and yet that 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.880
 three well-known things entangled caro 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.979
 and norwegian is quite clear on things 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.290
 believers in jackets or pullovers 

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.570
 of course, sweaters as well 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.880
 norwegian pattern poland karol is now 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.550
 also with the free time somehow 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.590
 also involved, it did come back himself 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.970
 rolling check pattern so that would be the 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.280
 knowledge of the money now so with 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.380
 summarizing year old and only a few 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.080
 Colors are currently very much in contact 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.970
 with his angular gothic Steve or 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.010
 so to speak, contrary to that perhaps 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.930
 the blog is karl moderate or too 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.280
 norwegian something cozy above 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.670
 extends and now we come to 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.250
 Just catch another mast below 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.989
 women by the feet so I am and 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.150
 My must have for this winter wind 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:38.470
 Ankle boots got seabed 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.440
 have ankle boots are in many 

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:44.260
 So hire 16 bands and the desert 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.450
 this is bloody boots 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.860
 with the cases in which the wild but 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.320
 the trend is steady and digital 

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.230
 Ankle boots and a very big one 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:55.840
 very very healthy food az 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.100
 Main work cognac game hurt so 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.420
 that means the pallets 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.100
 leather ankle boots in the color cognac 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.750
 which is also a trend color again 

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.829
 and that fits more to this there hear 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.660
 nothing contrary 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.459
 but somehow I think so can 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.910
 Start a lot are just a lot 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.709
 Shoes 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.180
 I already have it for 60 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.610
 euro digitally and that I find you 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.260
 still 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:13.520
 grown and now go because I too 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.490
 the pants because I would say that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:20.210
 cloth pants currently popular style so 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.010
 pants is generally red in colors 

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.840
 but not so blatant but also 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.820
 so the greens are dark at first 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.890
 green so if any of those is up 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.410
 each case a selfless so in general 

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.180
 but is very colorful rosel tendency 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.380
 black gray as I said is always there 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.900
 just the colors always a bit 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:38.390
 is in contrast to it and that's why 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.940
 my title in winter in any case 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.530
 my black cloth pants it is not 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.540
 It is not really good , either 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:48.430
 really stock it was in the middle left and 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.430
 my wife and my black mg 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.500
 Now we come to the top parts mine 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.240
 favorite category so really 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.760
 I think innovative thinking mostly 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.030
 directly at the gates of it simply direct 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.709
 things a norwegian and communication 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.300
 I know I'm a big fan somehow 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:10.640
 That's why I have colomba too 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.989
 Here anke green sweater to think so 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:13.819
 That is why it is now 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.340
 namely a green mayor 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:17.959
 sweatshirt made of knit to the mosque or 

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:20.419
 just the way a curious as now only 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.100
 once their real pullunder is and 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.690
 definitely less 

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:25.580
 engagement and I like this 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.110
 defend me it also belongs 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.730
 somehow totally to share training 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:30.110
 I do not know maybe last 

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.600
 But it's true, yes 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.760
 is pretty in the winter and therefore 

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:36.470
 this norwegian of me a big must 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.270
 have we stride mean the 

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.910
 other florian robert not part 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.440
 the t-shirts for the hands and thereby 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:44.000
 again the love for the talents 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.210
 I found now also newest 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.630
 bought data that is so red blue 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.560
 black and gray checkered but looks 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:53.540
 actually from Switzerland with the 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.610
 like them relate well I am 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.380
 which makes me a bit more relaxed but me 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:58.940
 would not be overdoing it with that 

00:04:57.380 --> 00:05:00.860
 carus not to 1 

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.440
 and then to the last category and that 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:05.810
 to the jackets and data in any case 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.520
 mine is doing it mentally 

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:08.900
 So I have two people and that 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:10.700
 one means racing is with 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.950
 trend sports that in black 

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:16.669
 they also delete some things 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.680
 say and then the velvety 

00:05:16.669 --> 00:05:21.140
 water he runs so well in this field 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.970
 is this velvety softer 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.740
 if you do not know my gentle one 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.729
 does that also know a title in art 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.860
 Check detail 

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:28.870
 that would mean at 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.639
 fashion must have in things jackets on 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.409
 in any case and I want to be on such 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:34.509
 now my bag that out for magic 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:36.610
 For example, a green pullover jacket 

00:05:34.509 --> 00:05:39.039
 a black where the palettes 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.449
 or for example a norwegian 

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:41.110
 sweater with a blue jeans and 

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.430
 stiefeletten 

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:44.259
 because I always find it extremely cool 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.030
 let the surfaces ashore and 

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:47.889
 What a pullover it is somehow 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.080
 partly is my style this winter 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.430
 generally totally mainz somehow and that 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.469
 it was made in my video with a 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:55.030
 two degrees in my fashion makes it and 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:55.569
 with my little inspiration occurs 

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.099
 at the end 

00:05:55.569 --> 00:05:58.479
 I hope you enjoyed it when you did 

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:59.919
 now also want more videos from 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:01.419
 you have then look at you anyway 

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.529
 my morning routine 

00:06:01.419 --> 00:06:04.180
 I have a little more 

00:06:02.529 --> 00:06:06.039
 buer so not me 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.949
 no higher stronger than that too 

00:06:06.039 --> 00:06:10.569
 but in any case, with the 

00:06:07.949 --> 00:06:13.629
 or my perspective 

00:06:10.569 --> 00:06:14.979
 my little talk round my crew in the 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.710
 I answer a few questions again 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:18.969
 but currently in this mill at the moment 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.610
 I was very fit and focused 

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:23.110
 which is actually ten customers for you 

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:27.330
