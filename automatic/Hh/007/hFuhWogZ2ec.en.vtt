pin continue to scrunch the fabric over
the<00:01:14.030> safety<00:01:14.270> pin<00:01:14.570> and<00:01:14.770> pulling<00:01:15.770> that<00:01:15.800> top

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
the safety pin and pulling that top

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.850 
the safety pin and pulling that top
layer<00:01:17.200> essentially<00:01:18.200> what<00:01:18.350> you're<00:01:18.440> doing<00:01:18.710> is

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
only one side is open in this case I'm

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.210 
only one side is open in this case I'm
actually<00:01:53.760> using<00:01:54.090> three<00:01:54.510> pieces<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.020> fabric

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
actually using three pieces of fabric

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.190 
actually using three pieces of fabric
the<00:01:56.220> to<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.910> hair<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.390> pink<00:01:57.660> and<00:01:57.870> the<00:01:57.990> white

the to the hair the pink and the white
are<00:01:58.500> being<00:01:58.950> turned<00:01:59.160> together<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.820> the<00:02:00.360> hearts

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
are being turned together and the hearts

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.350 
are being turned together and the hearts
are<00:02:00.810> coming<00:02:01.080> out<00:02:01.200> on<00:02:01.380> the<00:02:01.530> outside<00:02:02.090> much<00:02:03.090> like

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
are coming out on the outside much like

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:04.969 
are coming out on the outside much like
what's<00:02:03.690> going<00:02:03.870> to<00:02:03.990> happen<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.710> coffee

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
