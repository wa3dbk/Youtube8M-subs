00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
scoring each of the files that i cut out

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.920 
scoring each of the files that i cut out
in<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.929> previous<00:00:16.289> video<00:00:16.590> here<00:00:17.130> i'm<00:00:17.779> going<00:00:18.779> to

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
in the previous video here i'm going to

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.679 
in the previous video here i'm going to
be<00:00:19.020> using<00:00:19.050> my<00:00:19.650> exacto<00:00:20.160> knife<00:00:20.400> and<00:00:20.760> my<00:00:21.359> cutting

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
be using my exacto knife and my cutting

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:23.330 
be using my exacto knife and my cutting
board<00:00:21.720> that<00:00:22.410> i<00:00:22.470> showed<00:00:22.710> off<00:00:22.859> in<00:00:23.010> the<00:00:23.070> previous

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340 
board that i showed off in the previous

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.509 
board that i showed off in the previous
one<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.269> i'm<00:00:24.869> going<00:00:25.019> to<00:00:25.080> be<00:00:25.199> lightly<00:00:25.619> going

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
one and i'm going to be lightly going

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.560 
one and i'm going to be lightly going
over<00:00:26.820> each<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.630> tabs<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.949> that<00:00:29.160> I've

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
over each of the tabs here that I've

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.630 
over each of the tabs here that I've
nicely<00:00:30.570> cut<00:00:30.810> out<00:00:30.929> on<00:00:31.170> each<00:00:31.289> of<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.500> files<00:00:31.740> so

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
nicely cut out on each of the files so

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.430 
nicely cut out on each of the files so
that<00:00:32.669> I<00:00:32.790> can<00:00:32.940> fold<00:00:33.390> over<00:00:33.780> each<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.230> pieces

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
that I can fold over each of the pieces

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.610 
that I can fold over each of the pieces
to<00:00:35.040> begin<00:00:35.280> connecting<00:00:35.610> them<00:00:36.090> and<00:00:36.500> gluing<00:00:37.500> them

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
to begin connecting them and gluing them

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.770 
to begin connecting them and gluing them
together<00:00:37.860> but<00:00:38.489> most<00:00:39.149> likely<00:00:39.270> i<00:00:39.510> will<00:00:39.570> be<00:00:39.690> the

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
together but most likely i will be the

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.470 
together but most likely i will be the
third<00:00:40.020> video<00:00:40.290> is<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.739> gluing<00:00:41.160> so<00:00:42.090> instead<00:00:42.420> of

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
third video is the gluing so instead of

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.840 
third video is the gluing so instead of
having<00:00:42.570> a<00:00:43.050> flat<00:00:43.739> piece<00:00:44.129> of<00:00:44.309> paper<00:00:44.489> like<00:00:44.640> this

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
having a flat piece of paper like this

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.880 
having a flat piece of paper like this
that<00:00:45.270> i<00:00:45.300> cut<00:00:45.539> out<00:00:45.600> i'm<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.200> end<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.469> with

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
that i cut out i'm going to end up with

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.400 
that i cut out i'm going to end up with
something<00:00:47.460> a<00:00:47.640> little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.210> more

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
something a little bit more

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.939 
something a little bit more
three-dimensional<00:00:49.410> like<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> let's<00:00:52.680> see

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
three-dimensional like this so let's see

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:54.790 
three-dimensional like this so let's see
what<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> can<00:00:53.399> get<00:00:53.489> finished<00:00:53.789> this<00:00:54.149> evening

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
what we can get finished this evening

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.830 
what we can get finished this evening
alright<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:56.010> when<00:00:56.100> you're<00:00:56.250> doing<00:00:56.550> this<00:00:56.840> you

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
alright so when you're doing this you

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.729 
alright so when you're doing this you
want<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.109> make<00:00:58.199> sure<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.530> you're<00:00:58.649> not

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
want to make sure that you're not

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.709 
want to make sure that you're not
pressing<00:00:59.039> too<00:00:59.370> hard<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.390> you're<00:01:00.539> going<00:01:00.660> to

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
pressing too hard that you're going to

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.119 
pressing too hard that you're going to
go<00:01:00.870> all<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.140> way<00:01:01.350> through<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.680> pay-per-view

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
go all the way through the pay-per-view

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.410 
go all the way through the pay-per-view
just<00:01:02.489> gonna<00:01:02.850> go<00:01:02.969> lightly<00:01:03.420> over<00:01:04.400> the<00:01:05.400> top<00:01:05.700> along

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
just gonna go lightly over the top along

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.160 
just gonna go lightly over the top along
the<00:01:06.780> dotted<00:01:07.229> lines<00:01:07.799> here<00:01:08.750> so<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.900> you<00:01:10.020> can

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
the dotted lines here so that you can

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.390 
the dotted lines here so that you can
actually<00:01:10.350> come<00:01:10.770> in<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.700> do<00:01:12.150> your<00:01:12.360> fold

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
actually come in and then do your fold

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.340 
actually come in and then do your fold
for<00:01:14.400> each<00:01:14.549> of<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.820> pieces<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.540> should<00:01:16.259> also

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
for each of the pieces I should also

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.960 
for each of the pieces I should also
point<00:01:16.560> out<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.640> there<00:01:18.150> are<00:01:18.830> just<00:01:19.830> dashes<00:01:20.610> and

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
point out that there are just dashes and

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.130 
point out that there are just dashes and
then<00:01:21.270> there<00:01:21.479> are<00:01:21.509> dash<00:01:21.990> dot<00:01:22.549> dashes<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.900> dash

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
then there are dash dot dashes the dash

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.219 
then there are dash dot dashes the dash
is<00:01:25.170> you're<00:01:26.009> going<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> end<00:01:26.369> up<00:01:26.400> folding<00:01:26.850> down

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:27.229 
is you're going to end up folding down

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.850 
is you're going to end up folding down
the<00:01:28.280> dash<00:01:29.280> dot<00:01:29.820> dash<00:01:29.850> is<00:01:30.840> over<00:01:31.259> however<00:01:31.470> you

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
the dash dot dash is over however you

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.760 
the dash dot dash is over however you
want<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.100> go<00:01:32.610> say<00:01:33.210> that<00:01:33.420> you're<00:01:34.350> going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.560> fold

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
want to go say that you're going to fold

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.910 
want to go say that you're going to fold
up<00:01:35.360> so<00:01:36.360> I'm<00:01:36.479> my<00:01:36.600> project<00:01:37.049> actually<00:01:37.170> I'm<00:01:37.439> mostly

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
up so I'm my project actually I'm mostly

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
up so I'm my project actually I'm mostly
they're<00:01:38.130> folding<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.850> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.299> on<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> lot

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
they're folding in but I know on a lot

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.330 
they're folding in but I know on a lot
of<00:01:39.840> pieces<00:01:40.170> I'll<00:01:40.590> depending<00:01:40.950> on<00:01:41.040> how<00:01:41.130> they're

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
of pieces I'll depending on how they're

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.859 
of pieces I'll depending on how they're
shaped<00:01:41.670> you're<00:01:41.880> going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> have<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.240> go<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.600> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
shaped you're going to have to go up and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.870 
shaped you're going to have to go up and
down<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.439> the<00:01:43.470> pieces<00:01:43.710> when<00:01:44.189> you're<00:01:44.340> when

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
down on the pieces when you're when

00:01:44.880 --> 00:02:00.029 
down on the pieces when you're when
you're<00:01:44.970> going

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:00.039 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:02.260

going to calm night is a quick little
day<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.060> could<00:02:08.479> probably<00:02:08.660> moved<00:02:09.019> on<00:02:09.200> to<00:02:09.349> the

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
day I could probably moved on to the

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.650 
day I could probably moved on to the
next<00:02:09.590> stage<00:02:09.860> which<00:02:10.130> is<00:02:10.160> gluing<00:02:10.550> face<00:02:10.940> I'm

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
next stage which is gluing face I'm

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.930 
next stage which is gluing face I'm
probably<00:02:11.870> start<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.349> up<00:02:12.380> tomorrow<00:02:12.940> where

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
probably start that up tomorrow where

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:15.040 
probably start that up tomorrow where
I'm<00:02:14.030> just<00:02:14.060> going<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.330> take<00:02:14.450> a<00:02:14.510> hot<00:02:14.870> glue<00:02:14.989> gun
