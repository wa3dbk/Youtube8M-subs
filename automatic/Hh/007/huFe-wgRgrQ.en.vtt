I am welcome to this video to design
just<00:00:08.680> to<00:00:08.769> help<00:00:08.920> you<00:00:09.100> measure<00:00:09.730> up<00:00:09.940> the<00:00:10.090> skirt

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:10.389 
just to help you measure up the skirt

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:12.030 
just to help you measure up the skirt
your<00:00:10.600> Caravan<00:00:11.080> which<00:00:11.530> is<00:00:11.680> the<00:00:11.799> section

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:12.040 
your Caravan which is the section

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:16.650 
your Caravan which is the section
between<00:00:12.790> the<00:00:13.030> two<00:00:13.420> profiles<00:00:14.940> get<00:00:15.940> yourself<00:00:16.299> a

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:16.660 
between the two profiles get yourself a

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.920 
between the two profiles get yourself a
ladder<00:00:17.020> on<00:00:17.950> firm<00:00:18.550> footing<00:00:18.820> so<00:00:19.570> they<00:00:19.660> don't

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
ladder on firm footing so they don't

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.360 
ladder on firm footing so they don't
fall<00:00:20.169> off<00:00:20.320> it<00:00:20.500> and

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.370 

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.830 

tape<00:00:24.030> measure<00:00:24.200> and<00:00:25.340> the<00:00:26.340> skirt<00:00:26.700> just<00:00:27.480> between

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
tape measure and the skirt just between

tape measure and the skirt just between
the<00:00:27.960> profile<00:00:28.440> at<00:00:28.620> the<00:00:28.650> top<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:35.540> that's<00:00:36.540> 45

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
the profile at the top and that's 45

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.530 
the profile at the top and that's 45
centimeters<00:00:38.160> or<00:00:38.520> four<00:00:38.910> hundred<00:00:39.150> and<00:00:39.240> fifty

or inside what you're looking for is
distance<00:01:35.350> between<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.740> roof<00:01:35.950> and<00:01:36.359> what

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:37.359 
distance between the roof and what

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.319 
distance between the roof and what
you're<00:01:37.479> going<00:01:37.600> to<00:01:37.630> fasten<00:01:37.990> it<00:01:38.079> to<00:01:38.259> down<00:01:38.500> here

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you're going to fasten it to down here

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.490 
you're going to fasten it to down here
generally<00:01:40.329> it's<00:01:40.450> an<00:01:40.539> angle<00:01:40.810> bracket<00:01:41.170> down<00:01:41.289> the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:41.500 
generally it's an angle bracket down the

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.139 
generally it's an angle bracket down the
bottom<00:01:41.799> whether<00:01:42.369> it's<00:01:42.609> a<00:01:42.670> timber<00:01:42.850> or

aluminium but the main thing when you're
doing<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.359> or<00:01:46.509> want<00:01:46.750> an<00:01:46.869> internal<00:01:47.259> system<00:01:47.799> is

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
doing it or want an internal system is

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.649 
doing it or want an internal system is
that<00:01:48.399> you've<00:01:48.549> got<00:01:48.670> something<00:01:49.000> to<00:01:49.090> fasten<00:01:49.479> to

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
that you've got something to fasten to

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.190 
that you've got something to fasten to
up<00:01:49.840> here<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.380> lot<00:01:50.920> of<00:01:51.069> vans<00:01:51.280> don't<00:01:51.640> have<00:01:51.850> any

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
up here a lot of vans don't have any

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.830 
up here a lot of vans don't have any
support<00:01:53.200> in<00:01:53.649> this<00:01:54.189> section<00:01:54.490> this<00:01:55.420> one<00:01:55.659> has<00:01:55.810> a

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
support in this section this one has a

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.099 
support in this section this one has a
small<00:01:56.229> section<00:01:56.890> of<00:01:57.130> aluminium<00:01:57.700> and<00:01:58.060> we<00:01:58.840> can

00:01:59.099 --> 00:01:59.109 
small section of aluminium and we can

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:02.910 
small section of aluminium and we can
fasten<00:01:59.740> to<00:01:59.950> that<00:02:01.319> then<00:02:02.319> you<00:02:02.380> just<00:02:02.590> need<00:02:02.799> to

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:02.920 
fasten to that then you just need to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.370 
fasten to that then you just need to
stagger<00:02:03.609> the<00:02:03.729> order<00:02:04.720> make<00:02:04.869> us<00:02:05.020> a<00:02:05.049> special

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
stagger the order make us a special

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.240 
stagger the order make us a special
bracket<00:02:06.099> some<00:02:06.880> vans<00:02:07.119> have<00:02:07.450> 25<00:02:07.989> mil<00:02:08.289> some<00:02:09.039> have

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
bracket some vans have 25 mil some have

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.729 
bracket some vans have 25 mil some have
nothing<00:02:09.640> so<00:02:10.269> just<00:02:10.329> keep<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.079> in<00:02:11.140> mind<00:02:11.500> if<00:02:11.650> you

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:11.739 
nothing so just keep that in mind if you

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:13.830 
nothing so just keep that in mind if you
wanted<00:02:12.010> to<00:02:12.130> have<00:02:12.220> an<00:02:12.340> internal<00:02:12.700> system<00:02:13.299> what

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
wanted to have an internal system what

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.819 
wanted to have an internal system what
you<00:02:13.959> confess<00:02:14.349> and<00:02:14.380> -<00:02:14.620> up<00:02:14.769> the<00:02:14.890> top<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.620> that's

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
you confess and - up the top and that's

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:27.890 
you confess and - up the top and that's
really<00:02:18.099> about<00:02:18.519> it<00:02:18.879> it's<00:02:19.060> that<00:02:19.180> easy

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.950 

so<00:02:28.900> if<00:02:29.680> you<00:02:29.860> look<00:02:30.010> at<00:02:30.070> the<00:02:30.220> bottom<00:02:30.520> profile<00:02:31.150> you

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:31.960 
so if you look at the bottom profile you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:36.420 
so if you look at the bottom profile you
can<00:02:32.110> see<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> here<00:02:32.880> and<00:02:33.880> it's<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.450> angled<00:02:35.430> so

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
can see it here and it's just angled so

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.210 
can see it here and it's just angled so
this<00:02:36.580> would<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.880> an<00:02:36.970> angle<00:02:37.240> bracket<00:02:37.450> and<00:02:38.220> if

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
this would be an angle bracket and if

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:47.490 
this would be an angle bracket and if
you<00:02:39.340> come<00:02:39.490> up<00:02:39.610> to<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.850> top<00:02:40.090> again

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:03:01.080 

you've<00:02:48.460> got<00:02:48.580> an<00:02:48.700> angle<00:02:48.970> bracket<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:50.440> here<00:03:00.090> so

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
you've got an angle bracket up here so

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:04.040 
you've got an angle bracket up here so
you<00:03:01.150> can<00:03:01.270> see<00:03:01.570> an<00:03:02.290> angle<00:03:02.620> bracket<00:03:03.010> in<00:03:03.130> place

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
you can see an angle bracket in place

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.680 
you can see an angle bracket in place
top<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:07.090> an<00:03:07.690> angle<00:03:08.110> bracket<00:03:08.500> in<00:03:09.160> place<00:03:09.690> down
