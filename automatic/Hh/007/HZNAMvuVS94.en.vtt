might even think of running too I try

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:32.640 
might even think of running too I try
running<00:03:31.720> too<00:03:31.810> actually<00:03:31.959> but<00:03:32.139> it's<00:03:32.379> too<00:03:32.500> much

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:32.650 
running too actually but it's too much

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.629 
running too actually but it's too much
and<00:03:33.209> for<00:03:34.209> what<00:03:34.329> I<00:03:34.359> did<00:03:34.629> at<00:03:34.780> least<00:03:34.870> for<00:03:35.169> my<00:03:35.290> goals

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:35.639 
and for what I did at least for my goals

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:39.899 
and for what I did at least for my goals
one<00:03:36.639> is<00:03:36.970> great<00:03:37.209> enough<00:03:38.280> limiter<00:03:39.280> removal<00:03:39.400> and

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
one is great enough limiter removal and

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:42.750 
one is great enough limiter removal and
a<00:03:40.510> brain<00:03:40.690> control<00:03:41.019> these<00:03:41.799> are<00:03:41.949> two<00:03:42.310> cars<00:03:42.549> that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
a brain control these are two cars that

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.559 
a brain control these are two cars that
I<00:03:43.889> side<00:03:44.889> out<00:03:45.040> once<00:03:45.280> or<00:03:45.400> twice<00:03:45.489> depending<00:03:46.239> on

00:03:46.559 --> 00:03:46.569 
I side out once or twice depending on

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:49.170 
I side out once or twice depending on
what<00:03:47.019> I'm<00:03:47.109> playing<00:03:47.379> up<00:03:47.500> against<00:03:48.150> where<00:03:49.150> a

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
what I'm playing up against where a

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.689 
what I'm playing up against where a
limiter<00:03:49.900> removal<00:03:50.019> helps<00:03:50.919> you<00:03:51.099> go<00:03:51.310> for<00:03:51.549> game

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:51.699 
limiter removal helps you go for game

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:54.719 
limiter removal helps you go for game
and<00:03:51.930> I<00:03:52.930> find<00:03:53.199> it<00:03:53.290> to<00:03:53.319> be<00:03:53.409> better<00:03:54.280> than<00:03:54.430> brain

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:54.729 
and I find it to be better than brain

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.119 
and I find it to be better than brain
control<00:03:55.060> actually<00:03:55.590> blood<00:03:56.590> brain<00:03:56.709> control<00:03:57.040> is

00:03:57.119 --> 00:03:57.129 
control actually blood brain control is

00:03:57.129 --> 00:03:58.860 
control actually blood brain control is
