 Llama asks the coach in this 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:02.810
 section will be answered by a video 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.220
 to all those questions that you leave in 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.409
 the youtube comments on twitter and 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.599
 from facebook profe i tried promises 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:10.970
 promises average yo yo yo yo think that I 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.280
 yes it points to the gym how long I'm going 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.650
 to take there to put on like a rafa 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 able dwell att in the world of fitness 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.030
 the training there are many myths 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.829
 that we have to eliminate already completely 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.569
 because they are doing a lot of damage and the 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:25.130
 people believe them for example a myth 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.660
 that comes to mind many times 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.160
 you have heard that you have to eat every 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.480
 three hours to raise the metabolism and 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.010
 if we do not eat every three hours it's going to 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.720
 descend and we will have a lot of 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.840
 muscle catabolism and in the end we're going to 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.910
 lose muscle mass 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.590
 had I heard like that of times and it's 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.349
 really true it does not have any kind 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:42.870
 of scientific foundation that lie 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:44.280
 it is the rule trola everything had cheated you 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.950
 it was not until three in the morning 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.170
 so as not to count, he took me and me and 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.330
 proteins that I read it and looking for it 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.819
 magazine had gotten me to talk no longer 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.209
 I will read more look for magazine and silly 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.250
 are only scientific studies but nothing 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.560
 one thing I say to you next you will see what 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:02.849
 will throw with the head conclusion that 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.959
 quality of sleep that you will win is going to 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:05.670
 come much better at the time of 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:07.079
 hypertrophy that gain muscle mass that 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.730
 the fact of getting up to eat another 

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:10.290
 again and as this myth there are many 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.000
 more like children do not grow they 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.230
 they perform weights an error everything 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.670
 in fact, you can even 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.140
 stimulate growth another thing that 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.670
 I want to emphasize is that I am not any 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:19.200
 kind of guru nor do I have the absolute truth 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.120
 in fact I think nobody has the truth 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.319
 no doubt therefore although I tell you 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.150
 someone who is dedicated to this in this 

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.349
 case I always question everything having 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:26.910
 two fingers in front and say good what 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.799
 says this guy is consistent or is not 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.879
 consistent anyway I trust a lot 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.950
 the investigation and I will try 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.390
 always reference everything and 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:35.519
 explain yourself because everything that is said 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:37.049
 here are going to be general advice from 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.280
 the point of view of a person who 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.120
 dedicate professionally so now 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.099
 personal entrapment 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.420
 I want to remind guys that sport does not 

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.680
 it's a trivial matter to normally do 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.299
 exercise does not entail too much risk 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.739
 but sometimes things happen that way 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.480
 even if you get into this channel and 

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.069
 these tips the ideal would be that a 

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.930
 professional will evaluate your case of 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.610
 individualized form in fact what 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.840
 perfect would be for a doctor to become 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.430
 an effort test and it will tell you the 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:57.930
 seen to perform is decisive 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.069
 without any problem that a nutritionist 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.470
 or if I did a nutritional evaluation 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:03.090
 a physiotherapist an evaluation of 

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:04.500
 locomotor apparatus and a trainer 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:06.299
 qualified an assessment of the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.650
 physical condition and then start to 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.360
 give cane very important to consider 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.040
 first always the safety of 

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:12.510
 control and progression we can not do 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.310
 things to the gross the advice that 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.209
 are here always under those premises I 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:16.620
 I can not be there when you are 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.669
 training therefore you have to 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.650
 perform them by your own 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:22.139
 responsibility and always safety 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:23.430
 control and progression so I do not 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.139
 do the donkey please do the 

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.610
