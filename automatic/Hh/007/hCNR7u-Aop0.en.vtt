bearing screws because now I could be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.900 
bearing screws because now I could be
either<00:02:09.929> single<00:02:10.470> bearing<00:02:10.679> wheels<00:02:10.860> or<00:02:11.430> dual

with the bearing screws you can pretty

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.090 
with the bearing screws you can pretty
much<00:02:19.569> screw<00:02:20.260> them<00:02:20.410> in<00:02:20.709> to<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:22.830> tightness<00:02:23.830> that

now for those of you that have never

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170 
now for those of you that have never
used<00:02:29.170> trucks<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:30.250> bearing<00:02:30.610> screws<00:02:30.910> what

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
used trucks with bearing screws what

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.970 
used trucks with bearing screws what
that<00:02:31.330> means<00:02:31.570> is<00:02:31.720> that<00:02:31.750> the<00:02:32.200> truck<00:02:32.500> actually

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
that means is that the truck actually

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.760 
that means is that the truck actually
has<00:02:33.160> no<00:02:33.520> Axl<00:02:34.209> there's<00:02:34.780> no<00:02:34.930> axial<00:02:35.380> coming<00:02:35.650> out

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
has no Axl there's no axial coming out

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:37.410 
has no Axl there's no axial coming out
of<00:02:35.920> each<00:02:36.040> side<00:02:36.280> of<00:02:36.370> the<00:02:36.459> truck<00:02:36.730> you<00:02:37.209> actually

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
of each side of the truck you actually

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.240 
of each side of the truck you actually
have<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:37.900> get<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.200> screw<00:02:38.440> and<00:02:38.650> put<00:02:38.950> them<00:02:39.100> in

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
have to get the screw and put them in

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.430 
have to get the screw and put them in
this<00:02:39.520> way<00:02:39.790> and<00:02:40.120> then<00:02:40.840> you<00:02:40.900> tighten<00:02:41.140> it<00:02:41.320> you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
this way and then you tighten it you

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.750 
this way and then you tighten it you
tighten<00:02:41.800> and<00:02:41.890> tighten<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.310> then<00:02:42.430> once<00:02:42.670> you

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
tighten and tighten it and then once you

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.280 
tighten and tighten it and then once you
start<00:02:42.970> to<00:02:43.060> feel<00:02:43.209> a<00:02:43.270> little<00:02:43.360> resistance<00:02:44.050> and

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
start to feel a little resistance and

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.020 
start to feel a little resistance and
the<00:02:44.380> wheels<00:02:44.560> not<00:02:44.739> moving<00:02:45.130> you<00:02:45.580> just<00:02:45.820> loosen

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:46.030 
the wheels not moving you just loosen

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:47.729 
the wheels not moving you just loosen
them<00:02:46.270> a<00:02:46.330> little<00:02:46.450> bit<00:02:46.690> and<00:02:46.870> the<00:02:47.410> wheel<00:02:47.590> will

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
them a little bit and the wheel will

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.290 
them a little bit and the wheel will
spin<00:02:48.010> freely<00:02:48.840> single<00:02:49.840> or<00:02:50.020> dual<00:02:50.709> bearing

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
spin freely single or dual bearing

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.850 
spin freely single or dual bearing
fantastic<00:02:52.300> idea<00:02:53.580> also<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.360> kingpin<00:02:55.870> if<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
fantastic idea also the kingpin if you

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.770 
fantastic idea also the kingpin if you
see<00:02:58.050> you're<00:02:59.050> not<00:02:59.350> seeing<00:03:00.040> any<00:03:00.420> kingpin<00:03:01.420> stick

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
see you're not seeing any kingpin stick

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:04.199 
see you're not seeing any kingpin stick
up<00:03:01.959> from<00:03:02.200> the<00:03:02.530> hanger<00:03:03.370> of<00:03:03.550> the<00:03:03.580> truck<00:03:03.970> and

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
up from the hanger of the truck and

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.540 
up from the hanger of the truck and
that's<00:03:04.989> the<00:03:05.140> advantage<00:03:05.410> of<00:03:05.800> using<00:03:06.010> kingpins

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
that's the advantage of using kingpins

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.840 
that's the advantage of using kingpins
because<00:03:06.850> when<00:03:07.000> you<00:03:07.090> go<00:03:07.209> to<00:03:07.269> to<00:03:08.080> grind

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
because when you go to to grind

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.160 
because when you go to to grind
traditional<00:03:09.850> kingpins<00:03:10.300> that<00:03:10.480> come<00:03:10.690> up<00:03:10.900> words

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
traditional kingpins that come up words

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.060 
traditional kingpins that come up words
some<00:03:12.070> of<00:03:12.190> them<00:03:12.310> tend<00:03:12.640> to<00:03:12.910> poke<00:03:13.690> out<00:03:13.900> and<00:03:14.380> they

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:15.070 
some of them tend to poke out and they

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:16.740 
some of them tend to poke out and they
can<00:03:15.280> interfere<00:03:15.760> while<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.239> doing<00:03:16.390> your

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
can interfere while you're doing your

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.449 
can interfere while you're doing your
grind<00:03:17.260> but<00:03:17.860> with<00:03:17.980> these<00:03:18.130> kingpins<00:03:20.220> that<00:03:21.220> will

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
grind but with these kingpins that will

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.220 
grind but with these kingpins that will
never<00:03:21.700> happen<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.299> can<00:03:22.450> see<00:03:22.630> how<00:03:22.780> low<00:03:23.019> they

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
never happen you can see how low they

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.550 
never happen you can see how low they
are<00:03:24.239> how<00:03:25.239> countersunk<00:03:25.870> they<00:03:26.049> are<00:03:26.200> they<00:03:26.440> will

are how countersunk they are they will

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:30.240 
are how countersunk they are they will

see how they worked and in an honesty
they<00:04:09.040> worked<00:04:09.430> fine<00:04:10.350> but<00:04:11.350> me<00:04:11.590> I<00:04:11.859> prefer<00:04:12.190> my

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
they worked fine but me I prefer my

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.250

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
hangers to come back to a neutral

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.860 
hangers to come back to a neutral
position<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:15.190> lot<00:04:15.400> quicker<00:04:15.760> whereas<00:04:16.660> without

position a lot quicker whereas without

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.370 
position a lot quicker whereas without
the<00:04:17.260> pivot<00:04:17.560> cup<00:04:17.769> sometimes<00:04:18.669> the<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:20.019> hangar

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:20.380 
the pivot cup sometimes the the hangar

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.040 
the pivot cup sometimes the the hangar
would<00:04:20.500> kind<00:04:20.739> of<00:04:20.830> end<00:04:21.130> up<00:04:21.849> like<00:04:22.030> that<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.750> I

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
would kind of end up like that and I

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.420 
would kind of end up like that and I
prefer<00:04:23.229> them<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.620> come<00:04:23.800> back<00:04:23.979> to<00:04:24.190> neutral

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
prefer them to come back to neutral

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.430 
prefer them to come back to neutral
position<00:04:24.700> on<00:04:25.240> their<00:04:25.900> own

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
position on their own

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.910 
position on their own
but<00:04:26.650> that's<00:04:26.800> just<00:04:26.920> my<00:04:27.070> preference<00:04:28.740> you<00:04:29.740> can

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:29.920 
but that's just my preference you can

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:32.700 
but that's just my preference you can
adjust<00:04:30.040> the<00:04:30.700> the<00:04:31.300> tension<00:04:31.720> of<00:04:31.930> the<00:04:32.260> hangar

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:32.710 
adjust the the tension of the hangar

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.640 
adjust the the tension of the hangar
with<00:04:33.210> with<00:04:34.210> the<00:04:34.330> kingpin<00:04:34.780> I'll<00:04:35.230> make<00:04:35.500> it

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:35.650 
with with the kingpin I'll make it

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.040 
with with the kingpin I'll make it
looser<00:04:35.830> or<00:04:36.250> tighter<00:04:36.450> that'll<00:04:37.450> work<00:04:37.600> as<00:04:37.810> well

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050 
looser or tighter that'll work as well

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:39.960 
looser or tighter that'll work as well
but<00:04:38.560> my<00:04:38.740> preference<00:04:39.040> would<00:04:39.220> be<00:04:39.340> to<00:04:39.460> have<00:04:39.730> some

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:39.970 
but my preference would be to have some

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:42.750 
but my preference would be to have some
pivot<00:04:40.240> cups<00:04:40.330> available<00:04:40.870> and<00:04:41.080> that<00:04:41.670> would<00:04:42.670> be

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
pivot cups available and that would be

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.760 
pivot cups available and that would be
my<00:04:42.850> only<00:04:42.970> recommendation<00:04:43.180> in<00:04:43.810> regards<00:04:44.140> to<00:04:44.320> the
