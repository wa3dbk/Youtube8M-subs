never<00:02:37.450> pull<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:37.870> the<00:02:37.960> cables<00:02:38.380> because<00:02:38.770> you'll

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
never pull on the cables because you'll

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.230 
never pull on the cables because you'll
destroy<00:02:39.370> the<00:02:39.520> cable<00:02:39.850> and<00:02:39.910> then<00:02:40.000> you<00:02:40.090> have<00:02:40.180> to

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:40.240 
destroy the cable and then you have to

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.740 
destroy the cable and then you have to
order<00:02:40.510> anyone<00:02:41.520> because<00:02:42.520> these<00:02:42.670> tiny<00:02:43.120> there's

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
order anyone because these tiny there's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.350 
order anyone because these tiny there's
tiny<00:02:43.990> wires<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.650> are<00:02:44.710> slightly<00:02:45.240> soldered<00:02:46.240> on

and<00:02:46.660> it's<00:02:47.050> easy<00:02:47.260> to<00:02:47.520> pull<00:02:48.520> them<00:02:48.730> off<00:02:48.910> you<00:02:49.240> can

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
and it's easy to pull them off you can

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.960 
and it's easy to pull them off you can
pull<00:02:49.630> on<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.810> cable<00:02:50.520> now<00:02:51.520> we're<00:02:51.700> going<00:02:51.790> to<00:02:51.850> put

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
see if we get a green light now and it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.740 
see if we get a green light now and it
looks<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.370> we<00:03:24.760> are<00:03:24.790> getting<00:03:25.090> a<00:03:25.300> green<00:03:25.540> light
