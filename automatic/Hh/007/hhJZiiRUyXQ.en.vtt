00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
look around the actual cases so there's

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:58.670 
look around the actual cases so there's
the<00:00:57.480> access<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.050> volume<00:00:58.350> up<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.620> down

the access to the volume up and down

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.740 
the access to the volume up and down
slow<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.640> obviously<00:00:59.910> I<00:01:00.000> do<00:01:00.120> with<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.480> flick

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
slow the obviously I do with that flick

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
what I do like about the folio case is

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.179 
what I do like about the folio case is
once<00:01:09.270> you<00:01:09.540> wish<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.229> it<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:10.740> on

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
once you wish for it on the side on

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.770 
once you wish for it on the side on
charge<00:01:11.520> you<00:01:12.090> know<00:01:12.150> I've<00:01:12.240> got<00:01:12.420> full<00:01:12.630> access

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
charge you know I've got full access
whereas<00:01:13.260> most<00:01:13.409> flip<00:01:13.740> cases<00:01:14.159> block<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.610> say

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
whereas most flip cases block that say

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
whereas most flip cases block that say
is<00:01:15.000> a<00:01:15.030> benefit<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.020> show<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.380> these

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
is a benefit to show you how these

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.890 
is a benefit to show you how these
cutouts<00:01:16.890> line<00:01:17.310> up<00:01:17.490> at<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.640> back<00:01:17.850> there<00:01:20.840> so<00:01:21.840> as

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
cutouts line up at the back there so as

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.749 
cutouts line up at the back there so as
you<00:01:21.990> can<00:01:22.110> see<00:01:22.320> all<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.619> all<00:01:22.740> it<00:01:22.860> is<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.130> nice

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
you can see all in all it is a nice

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.280 
you can see all in all it is a nice
looking<00:01:24.150> case<00:01:24.420> doesn't<00:01:24.750> have<00:01:24.930> too<00:01:25.110> much

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
looking case doesn't have too much

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.170 
looking case doesn't have too much
thickness<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:25.950> phone<00:01:26.189> either<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:27.060> I<00:01:27.119> do

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
thickness to the phone either and I do

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.999 
thickness to the phone either and I do
really<00:01:27.509> like<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.900> metallic<00:01:28.200> pattern<00:01:28.650> and

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
really like the metallic pattern and

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.710 
really like the metallic pattern and
probably<00:01:29.430> would<00:01:29.520> have<00:01:29.610> liked<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:30.000> speech<00:01:30.570> and

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
probably would have liked the speech and

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.210 
probably would have liked the speech and
they<00:01:30.869> were<00:01:31.020> on<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.200> front<00:01:31.320> person<00:01:31.890> ever<00:01:32.070> that

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
they were on the front person ever that

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.490 
they were on the front person ever that
stand<00:01:32.520> to<00:01:32.610> work<00:01:33.030> personal<00:01:33.479> preference<00:01:33.990> so

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
stand to work personal preference so

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.990 
stand to work personal preference so
there's<00:01:34.650> no<00:01:34.799> magnet<00:01:35.250> in<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.549> so<00:01:35.729> it<00:01:35.790> will

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
there's no magnet in this so it will

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.910 
there's no magnet in this so it will
come<00:01:36.240> open<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:36.869> does<00:01:37.020> do<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.170> decent<00:01:37.470> job<00:01:37.680> of

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
come open but it does do a decent job of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.469 
come open but it does do a decent job of
staying<00:01:38.159> closed<00:01:38.579> overall<00:01:39.060> it's<00:01:39.210> not<00:01:39.329> one<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
staying closed overall it's not one of

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.270 
staying closed overall it's not one of
those<00:01:39.570> cases<00:01:39.810> it<00:01:40.140> just<00:01:40.350> flipped<00:01:40.590> open<00:01:40.829> all<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
those cases it just flipped open all the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.580 
those cases it just flipped open all the
time<00:01:41.520> so<00:01:42.240> you've<00:01:42.360> got<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:42.990> card<00:01:43.259> storage

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
time so you've got the the card storage

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.859 
time so you've got the the card storage
inside<00:01:44.100> there<00:01:44.759> is<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.880> quiet<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:45.750> can

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
inside there is a quiet there so you can

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.420 
inside there is a quiet there so you can
still<00:01:46.110> get<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.380> speaker<00:01:46.890> so<00:01:47.100> if<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
still get to the speaker so if you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.980 
still get to the speaker so if you
answer<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.149> phone<00:01:48.360> you<00:01:48.540> want<00:01:48.659> to<00:01:48.750> close<00:01:48.960> it

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
and you can easily take a call with it

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.120 
and you can easily take a call with it
closed<00:01:51.270> younger<00:01:51.810> have<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.500> flat<00:01:52.740> folded

closed younger have the the flat folded

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.520 
closed younger have the the flat folded
back<00:01:53.280> all<00:01:53.490> the<00:01:53.640> time<00:01:53.820> I<00:01:54.200> just<00:01:55.200> give<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.230 

so<00:02:02.860> yeah<00:02:03.010> indecent<00:02:03.610> protection<00:02:04.000> with<00:02:04.090> this

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
so yeah indecent protection with this

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.510 
so yeah indecent protection with this
case<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.810> like<00:02:05.200> I<00:02:05.260> said<00:02:05.320> I<00:02:05.710> think<00:02:06.250> is<00:02:06.400> the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
case and like I said I think is the

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.680 
case and like I said I think is the
third<00:02:06.730> tool<00:02:06.910> I've<00:02:07.000> probably<00:02:07.180> said<00:02:07.420> it<00:02:07.540> now<00:02:07.660> I

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:07.690 
third tool I've probably said it now I

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.150 
third tool I've probably said it now I
do<00:02:07.840> really<00:02:08.140> like<00:02:08.320> this<00:02:08.440> pattern<00:02:08.680> on<00:02:08.860> it's<00:02:09.040> got

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
do really like this pattern on it's got

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:10.740 
do really like this pattern on it's got
a<00:02:09.190> really<00:02:09.310> nice<00:02:09.520> feel<00:02:09.580> to<00:02:09.850> the<00:02:10.119> case<00:02:10.330> as<00:02:10.570> well

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
a really nice feel to the case as well

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.350 
a really nice feel to the case as well
so<00:02:11.440> something<00:02:12.220> really<00:02:12.250> unique<00:02:12.700> about<00:02:13.180> it

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
so something really unique about it

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.000 
so something really unique about it
they're<00:02:13.720> not<00:02:13.900> too<00:02:14.050> expensive<00:02:14.410> either<00:02:14.740> you

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
they're not too expensive either you

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.320
