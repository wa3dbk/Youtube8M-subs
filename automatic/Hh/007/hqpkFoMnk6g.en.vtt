00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:08.100
I am in the second year of Philosophy

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.440
I chose philosophy because I wanted to reason
I said, 'maybe it's time to reason

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:14.509
yes!'

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.500
I belong to a religious community which has
several houses in Rome

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.140
I've been here for five years

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.900
studying philosophy and theology
to become a priest

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.900
I 'm from Central African Republic
I'm here finishing my license in Philosophy (Ph.L.)

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.800
The Faculty of Philosophy of the Pontifical
Lateran University boasts more than

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.530
three centuries of history
it is a school characterized

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:47.400
by its long tradition

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.400
the strength of our school is a

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:56.149
creative fidelity to tradition
I mean, we take what is most advanced

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.250
in the field of contemporary  scientific research and what is most classic and solid

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.100
from the point of view of tradition

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.740
I teach the history of scientific thought in
the Faculty of Philosophy and my students

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.060
are interested in this multicultural and multidisciplinary, and here they find the right environment

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:25.630
So my colleagues are American
but also Burmese, Chinese, it's a real 'melting pot'

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.250
the different nations and different communities  form an an environment that enriches you, it is

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.400
universal like the Catholic Church, you could
say

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.670
it is also a community 
being "pontifical" also has this dimension

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.470
there are many activities

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.250
from campus ministry to the student secretariat, 
I'm part of the choir but also I also

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.479
volunteer in the area of pastoral care 
we organize liturgies and worship

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.400
Here is the place to discover a
philosophy that wants to aim for more

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.920
a philosophy which wants to be a means 
to build the future of knowledge

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.170
and to find solutions to the many critical and problematic aspects of the time in which we

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.220
are living
and who should we engage in this project

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.760
if not the youth, enthusiastic new students,
young people who are really going to

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.870
welcome all the challenges that the thought of our time carries with it

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:37.100
we have a variety of courses ranging from the History of Philosophy to theoretical classes in metaphysics and ethics

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.900
also the history of scientific thought,
Philosophy of Nature,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.340
we have a double course in classical and symbolic logic, also including the new modal logics

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.500
with an openness towards computer science
and many more, aimed at making a synthesis

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:05.400
which might sound strange, but it is rather accessible, between classical and contemporary scientific thought

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.600
my favorite courses...

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.310
a course that I particularly liked...

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:18.590
are those regarding the history of philosophy especially History of Ancient Philosophy, History of Medieval Philosophy

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:24.099
[the teacher] tried to make us understand

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.099
how a person can bring his argument
the public square without being seen as

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.200
a fanatic or full of pride

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.580
What can you do with a degree in philosophy?

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.800
thanks to the philosophy you can have many
possibilities, from teaching -

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:52.750
- In the future I can imagine myself
first, as a professor -

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.150
a graduate in philosophy can work in many different areas of research

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:04.500
We have colleagues, philosophers, working in
the field of artificial intelligence

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:10.000
complex systems, in the economy also in journalism,

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:18.000
we are involved in advanced research,  we collaborate with biologists, with physicians

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.550
as well as the possibility of becoming director of human resources, when a company hires

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:29.419
staff it also needs someone
who understands the psychology and thinking

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:31.300
the people they work with

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.150
I do not rule out as a possibility
getting involved in politics

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.889
because philosophy
was born in the context of the Greek "polis"

00:04:40.889 --> 00:04:46.650
and is used to find the light
to share that light with others

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.270
this is important to me

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:55.210
I take with me this universal vision for the future 
and when we will be scattered in different parts of

00:04:55.210 --> 00:05:01.289
world, wherever we're going, you never know, 
the bonds of friendships

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.130
will remain between us

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.000
