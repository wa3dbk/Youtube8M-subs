00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 stories of things today we talk about a 

00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.870
 object that you really asked me 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.000
 many 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.950
 so for your joy for mine 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.570
 joy but above all for the joy of 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.639
 smoothie string crew 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.380
 today we will talk about the blender it is 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.420
 of a modern son household appliance 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.330
 of the twentieth century, however, the concepts 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.380
 the basis of this tool are 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.449
 ancient date back to prehistoric times 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.250
 and this is why many indicate the 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.820
 mortar as the oldest ancestor the 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.560
 mixer 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.750
 it is a very simple tool 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.330
 formed by two objects that collide 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.890
 against each other by shredding everything 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.870
 what is in the middle is just for 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.480
 this simplicity of his, given that anyway 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:39.420
 even the monkeys make two clash 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.340
 stones to break the outer shell of 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.110
 some fruits and eat them only 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.239
 internal curve finds a range of 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.489
 very broad applications ranging from 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.950
 witchcraft to cousin medicine 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:52.770
 although the borderline between 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.379
 sorcery and medicine was a lot but 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.710
 very thin when present and the 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.329
 mortar was used to test 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:02.760
 of the medical herbs from which they came 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.670
 let out essential oils that came 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.890
 then used to create a wiki from 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 apply on wounds to disinfect 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 oc capital while in the kitchen e 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.880
 used for the preparation of some 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.460
 dishes based on the beating of 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.380
 fruits vegetables or more simply for 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.299
 shredding dried fruit seen 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.770
 that drying for centuries is one of the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.909
 main methods for conservation 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.470
 of food 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.299
 anyway going back to the other blender 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.250
 illustrious ancestor we meet in the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.259
 his family tree is the fork 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
 and spoon for a long time protagonists 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.700
 undisputed of the kitchen with multiple 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.140
 uses that work however in the case 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.710
 specific of descent from 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.840
 mixer 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:41.310
 they are just some of their functions 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.320
 they are particularly interested in theirs 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.180
 use to mix and assemble 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.740
 feed very simple operations 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.680
 however as simple as these 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.820
 operations is not really easy 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.600
 get a perfect result 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.100
 uniform 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.200
 and that's why over the centuries they are 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.790
 kitchen tools were built in 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.920
 able to simplify this operation 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.630
 the instrument itself is very simple 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.130
 in question is the mechanical whip that 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.229
 will therefore allow to mix and 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.090
 mix the food much more 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:08.950
 quick and effective and with an effort 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.840
 much less physical than this 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.760
 point we have a mortar part that 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.319
 it was used to grind and on the other to 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.090
 whip merchant that served to 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.410
 mix and it is from the union of 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.390
 these two tools or better 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:21.459
 from the union of the underlying concepts of 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.020
 these tools that the blender is born 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.560
 like many of you probably already 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.269
 will know in 1922 steven j poplawski che 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.970
 we can consider the father of 

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.100
 blender decides to place on the bottom 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.720
 of a glass container a blade 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.250
 rotating in this way all the 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.230
 foods that would have been paid 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.530
 inside the container would be 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.970
 shredded and mixed shredded 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.590
 his instrument is called 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.880
 blender name due to the features 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.100
 rotating blades 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.380
 however his intuition as far as in 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.799
 excellent brilliants is not very successful and 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.239
 about a decade later in 1933 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:57.220
 oil and I'm getting to know about 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.310
 blender of poe plus who will decide to 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.989
 apply some changes and improvements to 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.450
 this tool its version of the 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.370
 blender will be called mixer and strong of 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.620
 a heavy advertising campaign 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.299
 cost more than $ 25,000 that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.160
 at the time they were very many on 

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.650
 blender and spreads throughout the 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.120
 world and in the 50s they sell more than 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:17.709
 a million nice was wool on 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.450
 Blender then becomes an asset of 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.850
 mass present in many 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:23.799
 applications the companions of housewives e 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.900
 Hollywood actors and today 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.329
 we have several blender models that 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.440
 are based on operating principles 

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.730
 different as for example the trainer 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.130
 cylinder the immersion blender 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.600
 in the spring blender and that's it 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.230
 what I had to tell you about the auction of 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.609
 in the blender 

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.260
 if the video you liked it minutes it 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:41.290
 share comment put I like 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.690
 and if you want to sign up add me up 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.640
 facebook twitter google plus 2 you want 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.380
 this was stories I remember as at 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.010
 I 'm usually Thai and we'll see each other at 

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.010
 next video
