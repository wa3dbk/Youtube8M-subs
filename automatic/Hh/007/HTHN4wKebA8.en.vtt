six<00:01:49.000> hours<00:01:49.210> and<00:01:49.570> give<00:01:50.259> a<00:01:50.530> good<00:01:50.710> good<00:01:51.160> grip<00:01:51.430> and

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
six hours and give a good good grip and

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.210 
six hours and give a good good grip and
put<00:01:51.790> compromise<00:01:52.330> whereas<00:01:52.750> now<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.320> think<00:01:54.100> the
