00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.190
 force and the very first trailer

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.580
 justice in this video so I'm going so 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.869

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.000
 new bronze of star wars 7 and in

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.820
 batman versus super trailer 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.300
 but I know it looks like a porn but 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.960
 it's the right city, well you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.059
 have a good time 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.170
 we are going for the very first time 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.760
 on my channel to drink water case of 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.079
 'star wars' is the dream of strength in 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.969
 attacking us at the second band 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.200
 ad dedicated to movies and I have to 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.250
 to make a precision immediately 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.020
 thursday trailer 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.239
 everyone says trailer except that 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.079
 it's not a trailer 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 it's a teaser ok I have to 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.690
 make this precision since the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.399
 difference seems to have been ignored by 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.140
 a lot of people and yet do them 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.239
 more when it comes to judging 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.370
 well, this star wars announcement movie 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.840
 the purpose in teaser and intrigued you 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.010
 shows images that do not really have 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.090
 to relate to each other with 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.860
 a lot of fades to black 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.810
 a music that is very mysterious 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.670
 worth the goal is to awaken in you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.590
 the interest you look at you in teaser 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.150
 and you say to yourself ah I want to 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.869
 know more I want to go in the room 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.850
 to see the movie 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.530
 so the goal is to encourage the 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.460
 viewer to know more about a band 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.540
 announcement as for it presents you the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.650
 different elements of scenaristic 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.509
 movie and using three major scenes 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.680
 in order not to intrigue you 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.970
 but to lure you there 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.320
 normally if you raid it's good lance 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.780
 what you said I wanted to 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.520
 see the movie by the teaser there the goal is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.689
 to make you come to the room it's 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.159
 rather intrigued 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.479
 we want you to come here 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.070
 is sending out the mouth in Bulgaria is going 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.150
 will happen that will happen that's okay 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.590
 to be too dark it's going to be too swag 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.540
 look look at this fart from everywhere it's 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.659
 great it's great and it's not 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.790
 all the same thing and this video we 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.009
 saw all of star wars 7 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.290
 it's not a trailer it's not a 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.470
 trailer is a teaser and I tell him 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:54.479
 so have judged this teaser from star wars 7 in 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.549
 as such the first teaser accident 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:59.009
 the powerful and impressive images 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.509
 and when we know that it's already abrams 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.579
 is behind we say bah yeah everything to 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:05.530
 does normal that it slams so fucking 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.869
 but what is this horn teaser 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.520
 mr sarr the each picture is more 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.860
 impressive every shot is more beautiful 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.700
 than previous and all that demonstrates well 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.010
 what I always say 

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.780
 jj abrams is the genius of 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.000
 Hollywood entertainment with joss 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.830
 whedon and brad bird but they are there 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.020
 it takes small spanking millions to 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:25.060
 all the other directors of this 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:27.160
 middle and every time we see the 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.970
 violence in their film we say ok them 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.130
 guys know how to do it 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.200
 and when we see the trailer but 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.400
 just mortals we're not going to hide it from 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.290
 this new star war z and we see 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.340
 each plan studied by a drama 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.660
 by the way he abandoned his spears 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.959
 stop him from getting fucked 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:42.400
 well we say bravo here is the goal of 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.600
 teaser of this new star wars it was 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:45.580
 to show powerful images 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.890
 impressive and especially to intrigue the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.260
 spectator by the majesty obviously the 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.200
 deluge of superbly filmed action that the 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.000
 movie is going to be and j -g because it's a 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.440
 entertainment genius has completely 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.959
 removed the mission these are the images we 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.920
 see she slams her mouth and that's it 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:01.660
 the goal in theater 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.800
 but more than slamming the mouth and 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.390
 that's what's really interesting 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.800
 this trailer is that the images 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.720
 yes certainly absent pressure 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.220
 yes yes she sends her race 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.780
 are mostly very symbolic 

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.340
 they are symbolic of an idea that at 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:13.930
 my opinion will be conveyed by the film 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.420
 since it is already conveyed by the 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.579
 second star wars teaser this the idea 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.049
 that it's a new generation 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.090
 we are talking to a new generation 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.769
 proved to still see elements of 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:25.720
 old movies that are in ruins and even 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.720
 the speech of the udc with the famous 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.940
 transmission of the lightsaber from anakin to 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:33.610
 what we guess to be his son the goal 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.930
 was to tell us listen here's you 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.880
 did you like star wars you are the ones 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:39.130
 parents of kids who love star wars 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.269
 Well, this film will not be just for 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.859
 the nostalgic it will not be that for 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:43.870
 the fans of the first hour it will be 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.590
 for all we do not speak only to 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:46.660
 old generation 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.890
 we are talking to everyone and that's the idea 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:49.000
 really interesting from this new star 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:50.470
 wars that slams 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.450
 and above all there is the idea of ​​an inheritance 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.799
 which is really hyper interesting because 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:55.510
 that star wars is a movie that scored 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.799
 a whole generation that has marked the 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.200
 way to make cinema entertainment 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.730
 of the 80s 90 the cinema of 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.790
 entertainment ready in september 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.530
 and it's with this just that plan and this 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:07.480
 speech of the udc that makes four 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:09.880
 sentences we see all the intensity 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.950
 that there is behind this project and to which 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.989
 dot didier rams seems to have raised 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.739
 brilliantly this star trailer 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:18.389
 wars this beast class it's just 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.410
 email son and very intriguing each 

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:21.180
 plan is more beautiful than the previous one but 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:22.740
 especially they convey the idea that 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.789
 new generation is running and that 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.120
 it's nice to please 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.620
 old 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.930
 but you still have to think about doing 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.949
 a good movie visibly already 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:30.599
 the challenge hands down so I only have one 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:32.250
 to say more played during this 

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:34.400
 star wars 7 and up I want to see 

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.400
 the film
