00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.300
 Hello everyone, I am RXSFAI. 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.660
 It’s time to equip the series video. 

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.920
 If you have equipment, I want to try it out and make a test. 

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.180
 Can leave a message here or on my Facebook page 

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.720
 I will randomly select the video for the next week. 

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.740
 The equipment for this talk was provided by Mak Raphael. 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.740
 The main weapon is M416 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:31.060
 Accessories with red dot sight (any), laser/light combination, silencer or matt, right angle grip 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:33.780
 Pistol selection M1911 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.680
 The selected accessories are the same as the M416 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.220
 Equipped with a shocker or M320 and medical kit 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.740
 This time I chose this equipment list for two reasons. 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.000
 The first reason is that many people have told me 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.960
 I want to introduce some weapons that can be unlocked in the early stage. 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:58.900
 Because they don’t necessarily have unlocked the gun I explained. 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.640
 In addition, the second reason is that in addition to this equipment list is very detailed 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.180
 Still leaving your own usage and insights 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.880
 Have more communication with him 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.840
 So I chose his equipment. 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.620
 The official name of M416 is actually HK416 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.140
 The improved prototype gun is the M4 series M4 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.400
 The biggest change was the conversion to the G36 pneumatic system. 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.000
 So M416 can be said to be a hybrid of M4 and G36. 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.880
 Because it has the same appearance as the M4, its reloading action is also the same. 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.100
 When you have a bullet on the gun, it takes 1.85 seconds to change the magazine and the M4. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.100
 It takes up to 2.4 seconds to change the bullet when you run out of all the bullets. 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.500
 In terms of speed, 750 rounds of bullets per minute 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.320
 Bullet initial velocity is 600m per second 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.780
 Although the rate of fire is a little slower than M4 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.900
 However, it has the characteristics of G36 in the recoil. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.040
 The recoil is milder and lower 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.100
 The upward movement of the recoil is 0.32, 0.1 to the left and 0.3 to the right. 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.940
 Although the overall recoil is relatively low 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.040
 However, the recoil force of the first shot was 2.2. 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.140
 So attaching a right angle grip/folding grip can better control the M416. 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.860
 Even if the launch is tight, there is no need to control the recoil. 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.380
 On other accessories, let’s talk about the scope first. 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.760
 Because the rear seat force of the M416 is very small 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 So I recommend using a coyote sight that provides the best view. 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.800
 On the selection of sub-accessories 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.380
 Although the laser/light combination chosen by this netizen can make you have many advantages in the room. 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.560
 But because the laser/light combination can't be turned off 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.820
 So when you fight with the enemy, it will be very easy to be concentrated by the enemy. 

00:02:42.033 --> 00:02:45.193
 I would recommend everyone to use a laser sight (any) 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.800
 Before the Fall patch update 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.560
 The laser sight is basically not used by many people. 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.120
 Mounting the laser sight will also turn it off 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.640
 Because the laser sight is low in effectiveness and exposes its position. 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.900
 But after the update 

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:06.600
 The lumbar radiation accuracy of the laser sight is improved 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.440
 Allows you to have a certain degree of accuracy when you are not using the scope 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.160
 So I am also here to remind players who don’t like to use laser sights to revisit it. 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.256
 On the barrel fitting 

00:03:19.256 --> 00:03:22.136
 If you are not like me, then you love to play sneak attack. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.400
 It is best not to install any accessories to change the performance. 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.500
 Because the performance of the M416 is actually well balanced. 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.600
 If it is not necessary, it is best not to break this balance. 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.560
 But if you want to use M416 for the middle distance battle 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:46.720
 I would recommend you to use a heavy barrel, and a 3.4 or 4 times mid-range scope. 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:53.240
 Because the rear seat force increase made by the new version of the heavy barrel is reduced a lot 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.000
 So there is no need to worry too much, the problem of the recoil after installing a heavy barrel 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.660
 Overall, the M416 is a very easy to get started and controlled gun. 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.720
 And it’s the second assault rifle that can be unlocked. 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:11.540
 So it is very suitable for novices 

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.260
 Before unlocking to a later assault rifle 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.500
 In addition to the M416, you can find a gun that suits you. 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.260
 It will also accompany you over the rookie before you become an old bird. 

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.540
 I said it this time. 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.660
