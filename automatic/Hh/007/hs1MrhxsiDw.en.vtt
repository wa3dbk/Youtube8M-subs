learning<00:03:24.900> right<00:03:25.049> now<00:03:25.079> so<00:03:25.950> we're<00:03:26.069> gonna<00:03:26.160> hop

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
learning right now so we're gonna hop

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.670 
learning right now so we're gonna hop
over<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.760> Boot<00:03:26.940> Options<00:03:27.120> and<00:03:27.660> right<00:03:28.410> here<00:03:28.560> you

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
over to Boot Options and right here you

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.530 
over to Boot Options and right here you
have<00:03:28.709> a<00:03:28.829> selection<00:03:29.190> of<00:03:29.400> four<00:03:29.730> slots<00:03:30.060> the

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
have a selection of four slots the

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.270 
have a selection of four slots the
thread<00:03:30.810> recommends<00:03:31.260> you<00:03:31.350> only<00:03:31.500> use<00:03:31.709> two<00:03:31.950> slots

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
thread recommends you only use two slots

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.250 
thread recommends you only use two slots
so<00:03:32.519> Newsround<00:03:32.970> slot<00:03:33.299> one<00:03:33.510> around<00:03:33.810> satsu

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
so Newsround slot one around satsu

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.720 
so Newsround slot one around satsu
basically<00:03:34.769> you<00:03:34.829> can<00:03:34.980> flash<00:03:35.160> up<00:03:35.400> to<00:03:35.549> two

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
basically you can flash up to two

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:37.160 
basically you can flash up to two
different<00:03:35.910> roms<00:03:36.239> and<00:03:36.510> with<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> addition<00:03:37.109> of

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
the stock rom you have three roms on the

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.670 
the stock rom you have three roms on the
device<00:03:39.239> if<00:03:39.480> you<00:03:39.600> decide<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:39.989> do<00:03:40.079> that<00:03:40.230> but<00:03:40.500> for

dedicate to that ROM so right now is
that<00:03:51.930> twenty-five<00:03:52.440> hundred<00:03:52.859> megabytes

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250 
that twenty-five hundred megabytes

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:55.280 
that twenty-five hundred megabytes
that's<00:03:53.549> basically<00:03:53.910> 2.5<00:03:54.569> gigs<00:03:54.840> there<00:03:55.079> is<00:03:55.260> a

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290

actually<00:03:57.060> dedicate<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.690> ROM<00:03:57.870> itself<00:03:58.170> the

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
actually dedicate to the ROM itself the

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.140 
actually dedicate to the ROM itself the
max<00:03:58.739> is<00:03:58.920> four<00:03:59.160> thousand<00:03:59.639> which<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.760> basically

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.150

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
create this ROM slot so be patient

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.610 
create this ROM slot so be patient
alright<00:04:15.810> guys<00:04:15.959> so<00:04:16.169> we<00:04:16.260> just<00:04:16.289> finished

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
alright guys so we just finished

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.349 
alright guys so we just finished
creating<00:04:16.950> the<00:04:17.220> ROM<00:04:17.400> slot<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:17.940> as<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.120> can<00:04:18.239> see

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
creating the ROM slot and as you can see

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.180 
creating the ROM slot and as you can see
at<00:04:18.450> the<00:04:18.570> top<00:04:18.780> and<00:04:19.049> yell<00:04:19.200> says<00:04:19.410> ROM<00:04:19.620> slot<00:04:19.950> runs

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:20.190 
at the top and yell says ROM slot runs

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.219 
at the top and yell says ROM slot runs
not<00:04:20.430> one<00:04:20.669> so<00:04:21.090> now<00:04:21.239> we<00:04:21.299> can<00:04:21.570> actually<00:04:21.690> go<00:04:22.019> about

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
not one so now we can actually go about

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.900 
not one so now we can actually go about
