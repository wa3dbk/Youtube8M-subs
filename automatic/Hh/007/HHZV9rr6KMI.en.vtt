I mean most people that's probably not a
common<00:00:52.170> occurrence<00:00:52.379> but<00:00:52.829> if<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.129> ever<00:00:53.160> lived

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730

my favorite orange lipstick at the
moment<00:01:09.780> but<00:01:09.840> i<00:01:09.900> think<00:01:10.080> may<00:01:10.260> have<00:01:10.290> saved<00:01:10.530> that

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
moment but i think may have saved that

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
moment but i think may have saved that
for<00:01:10.920> my<00:01:11.070> monthly<00:01:11.430> favorites<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.450> talk<00:01:12.689> about

for my monthly favorites and talk about

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.000 
for my monthly favorites and talk about
something<00:01:13.080> a<00:01:13.110> little<00:01:13.200> different<00:01:13.439> and<00:01:13.710> that<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
something a little different and that is

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:18.050 
something a little different and that is
this<00:01:14.220> orange<00:01:14.729> um<00:01:15.710> eyeliner<00:01:16.710> actually<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.820> a

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
this orange um eyeliner actually it's a

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.330 
this orange um eyeliner actually it's a
waterproof<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.020> smudge-proof<00:01:19.340> eyeliner

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
which is going to be a lot really weird

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:24.200 
which is going to be a lot really weird
but<00:01:22.680> because<00:01:23.070> i<00:01:23.189> dyed<00:01:23.340> my<00:01:23.369> hair<00:01:23.549> brown<00:01:23.790> even
