00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
takes a lot of patience to learn this

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.390 
takes a lot of patience to learn this
stuff<00:00:15.389> so<00:00:16.170> don't<00:00:16.500> feel<00:00:16.710> like<00:00:16.740> you<00:00:17.070> should<00:00:17.250> be

stuff so don't feel like you should be
getting<00:00:17.609> it<00:00:17.850> as<00:00:18.029> I'm<00:00:18.480> doing<00:00:18.750> it<00:00:18.990> it<00:00:19.560> could<00:00:19.740> take

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
getting it as I'm doing it it could take

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.400 
getting it as I'm doing it it could take
a<00:00:20.160> long<00:00:20.490> time<00:00:20.550> but<00:00:21.539> in<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.779> end<00:00:21.930> if<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.140> do<00:00:22.289> it

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
a long time but in the end if you do it

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.170 
a long time but in the end if you do it
slowly<00:00:22.710> and<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.070> do<00:00:23.250> it<00:00:23.400> well<00:00:23.609> you<00:00:23.880> lay<00:00:24.029> the

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
slowly and you do it well you lay the

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.060 
slowly and you do it well you lay the
foundation<00:00:24.750> and<00:00:24.900> then<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.140> can<00:00:25.289> lay<00:00:25.650> back<00:00:25.859> and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
foundation and then you can lay back and

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.890 
foundation and then you can lay back and
have<00:00:26.220> fun<00:00:26.460> with<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:26.760> all<00:00:26.939> right<00:00:27.000> so<00:00:27.630> here's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
have fun with it all right so here's

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.339 
have fun with it all right so here's
figure<00:00:28.410> number<00:00:28.740> two<00:00:28.920> played<00:00:29.279> very<00:00:29.519> slowly<00:00:30.349> one

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
figure number two played very slowly one

00:00:31.349 --> 00:01:05.020 
figure number two played very slowly one
and<00:00:31.619> two

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.110 

and<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:06.930> a<00:01:07.140> lot<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.280> think<00:01:08.490> about<00:01:08.640> there

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
and so on a lot to think about there

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.030 
and so on a lot to think about there
another<00:01:09.390> way<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.660> practice<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.350> is<00:01:10.470> take<00:01:10.740> each

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
another way to practice it is take each

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.580 
another way to practice it is take each
chord<00:01:11.550> or<00:01:11.790> each<00:01:11.940> phrase<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.840> know<00:01:12.960> one<00:01:13.290> bar

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
chord or each phrase you know one bar

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.040 
chord or each phrase you know one bar
two<00:01:13.920> bars<00:01:14.190> at<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> time<00:01:14.700> and<00:01:14.910> just<00:01:15.600> work<00:01:15.869> it

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.050 
two bars at a time and just work it

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:17.780 
two bars at a time and just work it
until<00:01:16.530> you're<00:01:16.800> comfortable<00:01:17.100> with<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
until you're comfortable with the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.910 
until you're comfortable with the
interaction<00:01:18.390> between<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:18.840> melody<00:01:19.260> and<00:01:19.410> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
interaction between the melody and the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:33.200 
interaction between the melody and the
bass<00:01:20.100> note<00:01:20.369> like<00:01:20.550> this<00:01:31.310> and<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:32.940> you<00:01:33.090> know

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bass note like this and so on you know

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.560 
bass note like this and so on you know
drive<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:34.020> your<00:01:34.320> your<00:01:34.890> neighbors<00:01:35.310> crazy<00:01:35.570> but

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
drive your your your neighbors crazy but

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.940 
drive your your your neighbors crazy but
that's<00:01:36.720> how<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.259> down<00:01:37.440> and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:37.800> when

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
that's how you get it down and then when

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.350 
that's how you get it down and then when
you<00:01:38.040> get<00:01:38.160> when<00:01:38.399> you<00:01:38.490> have<00:01:38.640> it<00:01:38.820> where<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
you get when you have it where the

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:48.950 
you get when you have it where the
coordination<00:01:39.810> is<00:01:40.140> accurate<00:01:47.119> the<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.690> speed

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960 
coordination is accurate the the speed

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.870 
coordination is accurate the the speed
will<00:01:49.200> come<00:01:49.229> along<00:01:49.680> and<00:01:50.009> it'll<00:01:50.280> sound<00:01:50.460> good<00:01:50.729> at

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
will come along and it'll sound good at

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
will come along and it'll sound good at
the<00:01:50.970> same<00:01:51.180> time<00:01:51.420> now<00:01:51.960> think<00:01:52.259> about<00:01:52.470> listening

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
the same time now think about listening

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
the same time now think about listening
if<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.009> listen<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.340> blind<00:01:53.580> blake<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.060> you

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
if you listen to blind blake and you

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.350 
if you listen to blind blake and you
really<00:01:54.420> really<00:01:54.690> should<00:01:55.729> you<00:01:56.729> notice<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.210> he

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
really really should you notice that he

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.760 
really really should you notice that he
does<00:01:57.570> everything<00:01:57.840> with<00:01:58.140> this<00:01:58.289> effortless

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
does everything with this effortless

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:59.779 
does everything with this effortless
quality

00:01:59.779 --> 00:01:59.789 
quality

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:01.640 
quality
it's<00:02:00.149> like<00:02:00.330> he's<00:02:00.479> leaning<00:02:00.900> back<00:02:01.049> in<00:02:01.260> his<00:02:01.350> chair

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:01.650 
it's like he's leaning back in his chair

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.590 
it's like he's leaning back in his chair
and<00:02:01.710> he's<00:02:01.979> singing<00:02:02.520> and<00:02:02.700> he's<00:02:02.820> telling<00:02:03.510> little

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
and he's singing and he's telling little

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
jokes and he's throwing in licks and it

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.750 
jokes and he's throwing in licks and it
just<00:02:07.470> sounds<00:02:08.040> like<00:02:08.070> he's<00:02:08.310> having<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.640> great

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:08.760

time<00:02:09.179> and<00:02:09.479> it's<00:02:10.260> a<00:02:10.410> struggle<00:02:10.679> to<00:02:11.310> get<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.549> that

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
time and it's a struggle to get to that

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.850 
time and it's a struggle to get to that
point<00:02:12.120> of<00:02:12.239> relaxation<00:02:12.810> but<00:02:13.500> that's<00:02:13.680> what

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
point of relaxation but that's what

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.350 
point of relaxation but that's what
you're<00:02:14.010> aiming<00:02:14.160> for<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.610> part<00:02:14.910> of<00:02:15.030> what<00:02:15.180> that

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
you're aiming for now part of what that

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.229 
you're aiming for now part of what that
that<00:02:16.110> quality<00:02:16.709> consists<00:02:17.610> of<00:02:17.670> is<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> certain

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:18.239 
that quality consists of is a certain

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:20.420 
that quality consists of is a certain
little<00:02:18.360> bounce<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.200> rhythm<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.739> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
little bounce in the rhythm and the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.270 
little bounce in the rhythm and the
bounce<00:02:20.700> is<00:02:21.290> accentuated<00:02:22.290> when<00:02:22.799> you<00:02:22.890> hit<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
bounce is accentuated when you hit the

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.850 
bounce is accentuated when you hit the
second<00:02:23.790> bass<00:02:24.510> note<00:02:24.840> of<00:02:24.959> each<00:02:25.079> bar<00:02:25.410> a<00:02:25.650> little

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
second bass note of each bar a little

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:38.270 
second bass note of each bar a little
harder<00:02:26.340> like<00:02:26.519> this<00:02:36.530> right<00:02:37.530> so<00:02:37.920> you<00:02:38.010> hear<00:02:38.130> that

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
harder like this right so you hear that

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.970 
harder like this right so you hear that
boom<00:02:38.519> bop<00:02:38.850> bop<00:02:39.450> bop<00:02:40.110> kind<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.620> gives<00:02:40.769> it<00:02:40.920> a

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
boom bop bop bop kind of gives it a
