00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:05.990
 content produced then for the internet especially by the 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.290
 consumers themselves that lower production costs very much 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.030
 more especially and that allow having a sponsor to a wide one is a possiblity 

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.170
 to reach an audience that is dedicated to the father 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.910
 the television because someone said 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.440
 comes claret that evade on the television screen and the schedule in which baa 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.520
 it's sad this producer creator does not have the opportunity and the user does not 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.810
 can you give us 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.670

 that television for advertising companies to viviani 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:42.140
 I would say it's better I would say that among the first big role is to expand the 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 user base the customer base lovers are brought back to the new 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.249
 generation is that they do not consume products in a way 

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.729
 my children do not consume as soon as we and my wife and I 

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:53.700
 we make 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.500
 in third place 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.880
 extract transparency 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.340
 even for advertisers that a thousand in my opinion are one of the methods 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.440
 more benefited by this I finish you 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.630

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.130
 he knows perfectly the consumer profile and his consumption habits and 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.150
 you can try to change them as was the case with amazon colivenc 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.590
 could change the way people buy books 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.680
 pove hoben of your used things 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.240
 our case we are changing today's habit 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.740
 television in another way and that we also push concentrated to other products 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.000
 parallel to when we visited these sites like when we bought a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.330
 book and do not suggest so many titles to mention an example I 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.250
 would like you to touch the case of the project that you are heading and a civil 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.030
 in this same sense how they have gone that equator are the challenges in this era the 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:52.850

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.090
 they are coming up for a challenge these characteristics 

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.950
 good bokova diets a lcross time of 16 percent of the people who 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.650

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.300
 in internet television percent good that's the percentage of the universe 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.089
 and as we know the low steps in that sense we have 

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.930
 the good news is that that percentage will always try to go up 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:17.919
 clark it is clear that the talks are the challenges are very similar to the 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:18.759
