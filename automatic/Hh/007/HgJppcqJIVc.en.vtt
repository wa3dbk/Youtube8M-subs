00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.430
 now situations where he attacks us 

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.130
 with a knife and we do not have 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.480
 space 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.870
 for example we have a wall to the 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.849
 back 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.269
 you do not believe traditional techniques of 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.269
 disarm 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.810
 no it's not realistic it will not work there are three 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.860
 steps to follow let's attack fast 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.860
 from any angle 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.480
 do not 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.480
 traitor 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.160
 two 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.040
 we do it slowly the first step is 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.550
 grab your wrist 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:57.530
 the second step is to approximate 2 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.790
 and the third step is to project it to the ground 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:05.950
 back and from found our weapon 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:05.950
 I'm here, attack very fast, let's go 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:12.110
 the first step grab when both 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.110
 hands your armed hand 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.010
 if you are from another angle 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.100
 to grab number 2 attacks from 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.420
 any angle 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.690
 grab 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.030
 and move forward 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.030
 again from any other angle 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.040
 as well 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.830
 grab and move 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:45.750
 the third step is to take you down 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.580
 not necessarily to the ground but if 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.490
 move the knife away from us 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.119
 I'm here 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.119
 it attacks me 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.810
 advanced we pushed her to the ground 

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:04.530
 do not try to remove the weapon 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:09.619
 It is very dangerous 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.619
 we move away from him and he draws yes 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.379
 or else we turn away from him is capable
