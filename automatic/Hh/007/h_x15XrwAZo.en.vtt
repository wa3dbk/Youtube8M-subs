lair we ought to see it out in the

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.510 
lair we ought to see it out in the
circuit<00:01:37.869> a<00:01:37.929> bit<00:01:38.049> more<00:01:38.229> I<00:01:38.259> think<00:01:38.349> right<00:01:38.799> yeah

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
circuit a bit more I think right yeah

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.800 
circuit a bit more I think right yeah
it's<00:01:39.819> just<00:01:39.969> getting<00:01:40.179> the<00:01:40.479> three<00:01:40.689> or<00:01:40.779> four

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
it's just getting the three or four

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.019 
it's just getting the three or four
people<00:01:40.959> to<00:01:41.409> take<00:01:41.649> it<00:01:41.950> because<00:01:42.310> it<00:01:42.549> is<00:01:42.670> a<00:01:42.700> bit<00:01:42.939> of

00:01:43.019 --> 00:01:43.029 
people to take it because it is a bit of

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:45.239 
people to take it because it is a bit of
a<00:01:43.119> lump<00:01:43.329> when<00:01:44.109> I<00:01:44.200> built<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.619> I<00:01:44.799> built<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:45.219> to

00:01:45.239 --> 00:01:45.249 
a lump when I built it I built it to

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:48.959 
a lump when I built it I built it to
last<00:01:45.579> and<00:01:46.029> hence<00:01:47.020> it<00:01:47.469> became<00:01:48.459> a<00:01:48.490> very<00:01:48.579> heavy

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:48.969 
last and hence it became a very heavy

00:01:48.969 --> 00:01:51.510 
last and hence it became a very heavy
commodity<00:01:49.509> to<00:01:49.659> lug<00:01:49.840> around<00:01:50.009> but<00:01:51.009> the<00:01:51.310> club

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520
