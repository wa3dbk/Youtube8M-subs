okay so here we are and we're about
right<00:00:04.589> here<00:00:05.870> and<00:00:06.870> now<00:00:06.899> i<00:00:08.780> know<00:00:09.780> that<00:00:09.900> i'm<00:00:10.170> going

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
right here and now i know that i'm going

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
right here and now i know that i'm going
to<00:00:10.349> have<00:00:10.530> some<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:11.010> high<00:00:11.280> detail<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.910> here

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
to have some really high detail in here

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.330 
to have some really high detail in here
and<00:00:13.049> usually<00:00:13.469> what<00:00:13.620> i<00:00:13.679> would<00:00:13.889> do<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.160> go

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
and usually what i would do is go

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.689 
and usually what i would do is go
straight<00:00:14.670> across<00:00:15.560> but<00:00:16.560> because<00:00:17.340> of<00:00:17.369> that

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
straight across but because of that

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.220 
straight across but because of that
detail<00:00:19.400> this<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.550> why<00:00:20.730> i<00:00:20.760> have<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.300> insert<00:00:22.170> a

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
detail this is why i have to insert a

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:30.140 
detail this is why i have to insert a
lot<00:00:22.619> of<00:00:22.800> edge<00:00:22.949> loops<00:00:26.090> now<00:00:28.460> on<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.730> other<00:00:29.880> side

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
lot of edge loops now on the other side

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.669 
lot of edge loops now on the other side
however<00:00:30.330> i'm<00:00:30.840> not<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> have<00:00:31.439> a<00:00:31.470> whole

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
however i'm not going to have a whole

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.389 
however i'm not going to have a whole
lot<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.949> detail<00:00:33.230> unless<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.500> I<00:00:34.739> do<00:00:34.800> both<00:00:35.130> sides

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
lot of detail unless I I do both sides

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.510 
lot of detail unless I I do both sides
with<00:00:35.640> the<00:00:35.730> teeth<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.770> if<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:37.890> do<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:38.309> I<00:00:40.520> would

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
with the teeth and if I do that I would

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.080 
with the teeth and if I do that I would
question<00:00:41.790> why<00:00:42.649> if<00:00:43.649> it's<00:00:43.950> a<00:00:44.160> if<00:00:44.520> it's<00:00:44.700> a<00:00:44.850> game

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
it's starting to get a little haywire

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.930 
it's starting to get a little haywire
where<00:01:21.470> you<00:01:22.040> know<00:01:22.160> I'm<00:01:22.250> having<00:01:22.430> a<00:01:22.610> hard<00:01:22.880> time

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
where you know I'm having a hard time

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.610 
where you know I'm having a hard time
finding<00:01:23.540> an<00:01:23.630> area<00:01:24.050> or<00:01:24.650> a<00:01:26.170> way<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.200> placing

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:27.620 
finding an area or a way of placing

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.420 
finding an area or a way of placing
these<00:01:28.270> without<00:01:29.270> seeing<00:01:29.840> through<00:01:30.260> it<00:01:30.410> so<00:01:31.250> there

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
these without seeing through it so there

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:40.560 
these without seeing through it so there
we<00:01:31.520> go

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.480 

again<00:01:41.170> I'm<00:01:41.260> going<00:01:41.409> to<00:01:41.470> try<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.770> adjust<00:01:41.890> this<00:01:42.430> a

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
again I'm going to try to adjust this a

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:53.340 
again I'm going to try to adjust this a
little<00:01:42.790> bit

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:18.280 

it's<00:01:53.860> a<00:01:53.950> little<00:01:54.040> bit<00:01:54.250> better

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.890 

it's<00:02:19.189> nice<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.459> have<00:02:19.849> that<00:02:20.090> feature<00:02:20.329> to<00:02:20.780> be

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
it's nice to have that feature to be

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.470 
it's nice to have that feature to be
able<00:02:20.989> to<00:02:21.140> turn<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.439> down<00:02:21.469> there's<00:02:22.129> a<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:23.209> last

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
able to turn it down there's a the last

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.949 
able to turn it down there's a the last
version<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.230> zbrush<00:02:24.680> I<00:02:25.719> don't<00:02:26.719> know<00:02:26.780> the

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
version of zbrush I don't know the

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.160 
version of zbrush I don't know the
transparency<00:02:27.620> really<00:02:28.280> did<00:02:28.519> a<00:02:28.549> poor<00:02:29.000> job

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
transparency really did a poor job

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:39.620 
transparency really did a poor job
there's<00:02:30.170> no<00:02:30.379> doubt<00:02:30.409> about<00:02:30.620> it<00:02:30.939> so

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:41.480 

again<00:02:40.230> always<00:02:40.440> check<00:02:40.800> a<00:02:40.980> to<00:02:41.040> make<00:02:41.310> sure

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
again always check a to make sure

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:43.600 
again always check a to make sure
everything<00:02:41.880> is<00:02:42.080> going<00:02:43.080> together<00:02:43.230> and

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
everything is going together and

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.490 
everything is going together and
incidentally<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:45.060> know<00:02:45.210> higher<00:02:45.720> res<00:02:45.960> meshes

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
incidentally you know higher res meshes

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.710 
incidentally you know higher res meshes
it's<00:02:46.860> really<00:02:47.220> easy<00:02:47.370> to<00:02:47.520> kind<00:02:47.760> of<00:02:47.850> move<00:02:48.030> a<00:02:48.180> move

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
it's really easy to kind of move a move

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.650 
it's really easy to kind of move a move
around<00:02:49.110> and<00:02:49.350> a<00:02:49.560> get<00:02:50.430> into<00:02:50.760> an<00:02:50.850> area<00:02:51.090> and<00:02:51.480> then

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:51.660 
around and a get into an area and then

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.920 
around and a get into an area and then
hit<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.140> again<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.740> then<00:02:53.610> connect<00:02:54.030> the<00:02:54.150> dots<00:02:56.930> so

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
hit a again and then connect the dots so

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:07.680 
hit a again and then connect the dots so
in<00:02:58.230> this<00:02:58.320> case<00:02:58.530> i'll<00:02:58.770> move<00:02:58.950> this<00:02:59.010> down

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:11.270 

OOP<00:03:08.260> now<00:03:08.710> one<00:03:08.860> didn't<00:03:09.100> connect<00:03:09.430> I<00:03:09.610> saw<00:03:09.850> it

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
OOP now one didn't connect I saw it

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.780 
OOP now one didn't connect I saw it
again<00:03:12.280> I'm<00:03:12.580> holding<00:03:12.910> shift<00:03:14.070> shift<00:03:15.070> click

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
again I'm holding shift shift click

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.690 
again I'm holding shift shift click
shift<00:03:16.270> click<00:03:16.600> shift<00:03:16.930> click<00:03:17.230> so<00:03:17.950> shift<00:03:18.280> click

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
shift click shift click so shift click

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.930 
shift click shift click so shift click
shift<00:03:21.700> click<00:03:23.220> if<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.520> doesn't<00:03:24.820> look<00:03:24.880> like

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
shift click if it doesn't look like

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:31.850 
shift click if it doesn't look like
connected<00:03:25.750> I<00:03:25.870> back<00:03:26.380> up<00:03:26.410> I<00:03:26.800> don't<00:03:26.980> mess<00:03:27.760> around

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.620 

I'm<00:03:32.860> get<00:03:33.100> into<00:03:33.340> areas<00:03:33.760> where<00:03:33.790> it's<00:03:34.240> really

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
I'm get into areas where it's really

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.350 
I'm get into areas where it's really
getting<00:03:34.870> hard<00:03:35.110> to<00:03:35.350> be<00:03:35.710> able<00:03:35.800> to<00:03:36.120> connect<00:03:37.120> two

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:37.360 
getting hard to be able to connect two

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:50.660 
getting hard to be able to connect two
together<00:03:38.580> without<00:03:39.580> seeing<00:03:40.180> another<00:03:40.360> one

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.570 

on<00:03:51.670> the<00:03:51.880> back<00:03:52.060> side<00:03:52.090> I'm<00:03:52.480> going<00:03:52.570> to<00:03:52.750> not<00:03:53.580> take

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
on the back side I'm going to not take

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.220 
on the back side I'm going to not take
my<00:03:54.760> time<00:03:54.940> so<00:03:55.180> much<00:03:55.300> i'm<00:03:55.480> going<00:03:55.660> to<00:03:55.720> just<00:03:55.900> power

00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.230 
my time so much i'm going to just power

00:03:56.230 --> 00:03:59.190 
my time so much i'm going to just power
it<00:03:56.410> out<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:57.640> just<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.120> front<00:03:58.480> side<00:03:58.720> that's

00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.200 
it out it's just this front side that's

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.020 
it out it's just this front side that's
the<00:03:59.470> hardest<00:03:59.860> because<00:04:00.220> it's<00:04:00.520> going<00:04:00.670> to<00:04:00.730> be<00:04:00.880> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
the hardest because it's going to be the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:24.640 
the hardest because it's going to be the
one<00:04:01.210> showing<00:04:01.510> all<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:01.930> detail

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.710 

there<00:04:25.250> we<00:04:25.340> go<00:04:25.750> pretty<00:04:26.750> nice<00:04:28.300> again<00:04:29.300> with<00:04:29.449> wire

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
there we go pretty nice again with wire

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:37.060 
there we go pretty nice again with wire
frame

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.980 

I<00:04:37.160> think<00:04:37.850> one<00:04:37.970> of<00:04:38.000> these<00:04:38.210> are<00:04:38.390> wireframe

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:38.990 
I think one of these are wireframe

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.790 
I think one of these are wireframe
opacity<00:04:39.850> there<00:04:40.850> we<00:04:40.970> go<00:04:41.410> so<00:04:42.410> now<00:04:42.530> you<00:04:42.590> could

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:42.800 
opacity there we go so now you could

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:49.810 
opacity there we go so now you could
really<00:04:42.920> see<00:04:43.040> that<00:04:43.250> Polly<00:04:43.520> frame<00:04:48.730> now<00:04:49.730> the

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
really see that Polly frame now the

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.210 
really see that Polly frame now the
backside<00:04:50.390> as<00:04:50.660> I<00:04:51.080> said<00:04:51.350> you<00:04:51.770> know<00:04:51.890> it's<00:04:52.010> one<00:04:52.160> of

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:52.220 
backside as I said you know it's one of

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.760 
backside as I said you know it's one of
those<00:04:52.310> things<00:04:52.400> i<00:04:52.700> could<00:04:52.760> power<00:04:53.060> out<00:04:53.770> the

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:54.770 
those things i could power out the

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.650 
those things i could power out the
problem<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.370> you<00:04:55.610> know<00:04:55.850> it's<00:04:56.000> getting<00:04:56.270> really

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:56.660 
problem is you know it's getting really

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:03.010 
problem is you know it's getting really
hard<00:04:57.080> to<00:04:57.320> see<00:04:57.560> what's<00:04:57.920> going<00:04:58.220> on<00:04:58.930> so<00:05:01.690> in<00:05:02.690> this

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:03.020 
hard to see what's going on so in this

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:14.010 
hard to see what's going on so in this
case

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.110 

I<00:05:14.139> have<00:05:14.710> to<00:05:14.860> complete<00:05:15.190> this<00:05:15.340> edge<00:05:15.580> on<00:05:15.759> this<00:05:15.940> one

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:16.120 
I have to complete this edge on this one

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:19.080 
I have to complete this edge on this one
side<00:05:16.889> and<00:05:17.889> this<00:05:18.220> is<00:05:18.400> probably<00:05:18.639> not<00:05:18.789> going<00:05:19.030> to

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:19.090 
side and this is probably not going to

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.930 
side and this is probably not going to
be<00:05:19.210> even<00:05:19.360> this<00:05:19.780> thick<00:05:20.160> but<00:05:21.160> I<00:05:21.190> put<00:05:21.639> a<00:05:21.669> lot<00:05:21.879> of

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
be even this thick but I put a lot of

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.689 
be even this thick but I put a lot of
thickness<00:05:22.449> behind<00:05:22.840> it<00:05:23.190> because<00:05:24.190> of<00:05:24.520> the

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
thickness behind it because of the

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.749 
thickness behind it because of the
simple<00:05:25.060> fact<00:05:25.330> that<00:05:25.889> it<00:05:26.889> allows<00:05:27.220> me<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.580> add<00:05:27.729> a

00:05:27.749 --> 00:05:27.759 
simple fact that it allows me to add a

00:05:27.759 --> 00:05:30.649 
simple fact that it allows me to add a
lot<00:05:28.180> of<00:05:28.419> these<00:05:28.539> edge<00:05:28.750> loops<00:05:29.050> in<00:05:29.229> this<00:05:29.379> area

00:05:30.649 --> 00:05:30.659 
lot of these edge loops in this area

00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:33.089 
lot of these edge loops in this area
there<00:05:31.659> by<00:05:31.900> having<00:05:32.259> enough<00:05:32.470> detail<00:05:32.860> for<00:05:32.889> the

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:33.099 
there by having enough detail for the

00:05:33.099 --> 00:05:37.050 
there by having enough detail for the
teeth<00:05:33.690> if<00:05:34.690> they<00:05:35.110> were<00:05:35.169> to<00:05:35.440> close<00:05:35.759> it<00:05:36.759> would<00:05:36.940> be

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
teeth if they were to close it would be

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:39.300 
teeth if they were to close it would be
too<00:05:37.270> hard<00:05:37.300> to<00:05:37.720> put<00:05:38.379> that<00:05:38.530> detail<00:05:38.919> in<00:05:39.129> order

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:39.310 
too hard to put that detail in order

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:45.330 
too hard to put that detail in order
those<00:05:39.520> edge<00:05:39.699> loops<00:05:39.970> in<00:05:40.150> so<00:05:43.470> that's<00:05:44.470> why<00:05:44.830> that's

00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:45.340 
those edge loops in so that's why that's

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:47.909 
those edge loops in so that's why that's
why<00:05:45.460> this<00:05:45.580> piece<00:05:46.060> is<00:05:46.240> so<00:05:46.419> thick<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:47.080> you'll

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:47.919 
why this piece is so thick and you'll

00:05:47.919 --> 00:05:50.159 
why this piece is so thick and you'll
learn<00:05:48.099> that<00:05:48.159> you'll<00:05:49.120> learn<00:05:49.330> that<00:05:49.389> you<00:05:50.080> know

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:50.169 
learn that you'll learn that you know

00:05:50.169 --> 00:05:52.050 
learn that you'll learn that you know
sometimes<00:05:50.680> it's<00:05:50.919> easier<00:05:51.220> to<00:05:51.280> make<00:05:51.550> pieces

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:52.060 
sometimes it's easier to make pieces

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:54.409 
sometimes it's easier to make pieces
really<00:05:52.419> thick<00:05:52.810> andreat<00:05:53.169> apologize<00:05:53.740> them<00:05:53.949> or

00:05:54.409 --> 00:05:54.419 
really thick andreat apologize them or

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:57.180 
really thick andreat apologize them or
rather<00:05:55.419> than<00:05:55.659> super<00:05:56.050> paper-thin<00:05:56.409> and<00:05:56.680> try<00:05:57.130> to

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:57.190 
rather than super paper-thin and try to

00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.430 
rather than super paper-thin and try to
get<00:05:58.060> all<00:05:58.150> that<00:05:58.330> detail<00:05:58.750> edge<00:05:58.960> loops<00:05:59.229> in<00:05:59.409> the

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
get all that detail edge loops in the

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:03.600 
get all that detail edge loops in the
air<00:06:01.199> even<00:06:02.199> with<00:06:02.319> characters<00:06:02.770> like<00:06:03.009> you<00:06:03.490> know

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
air even with characters like you know

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.830 
air even with characters like you know
like<00:06:03.880> mouths<00:06:04.240> and<00:06:04.690> lips<00:06:04.990> and<00:06:06.569> around<00:06:07.569> the<00:06:07.659> eyes

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:07.840 
like mouths and lips and around the eyes

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.860 
like mouths and lips and around the eyes
sometimes<00:06:08.440> it's<00:06:08.860> easy<00:06:09.069> to<00:06:09.310> have<00:06:09.340> the<00:06:09.610> eyes<00:06:09.880> put

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:10.870 
sometimes it's easy to have the eyes put

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:13.230 
sometimes it's easy to have the eyes put
really<00:06:11.530> far<00:06:11.740> apart<00:06:11.889> and<00:06:12.400> then<00:06:12.669> all<00:06:13.120> of<00:06:13.150> a

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
really far apart and then all of a

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.089 
really far apart and then all of a
sudden<00:06:13.300> you<00:06:13.780> can<00:06:13.990> put<00:06:14.169> all<00:06:14.289> the<00:06:14.440> topology<00:06:14.949> in

00:06:15.089 --> 00:06:15.099 
sudden you can put all the topology in

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:17.010 
sudden you can put all the topology in
and<00:06:15.340> then<00:06:15.879> move<00:06:16.150> them<00:06:16.270> really<00:06:16.569> close<00:06:16.810> together

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:17.020 
and then move them really close together

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:24.659 
and then move them really close together
after<00:06:17.949> the<00:06:18.039> fact<00:06:21.930> just<00:06:22.930> tricks<00:06:23.500> it's<00:06:23.860> all<00:06:24.130> just

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
after the fact just tricks it's all just

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:35.140 
after the fact just tricks it's all just
dirty<00:06:25.180> tricks

00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:35.150 

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:41.140 

cool<00:06:36.010> ok<00:06:37.010> now

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:41.150 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:42.880 

to<00:06:41.660> complete<00:06:41.990> the<00:06:42.140> edge<00:06:42.350> loop<00:06:42.590> with<00:06:42.770> the

00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:42.890 
to complete the edge loop with the

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:45.370 
to complete the edge loop with the
spokes<00:06:43.190> and<00:06:43.610> then<00:06:43.790> i<00:06:43.880> can<00:06:44.030> hit<00:06:44.180> make<00:06:44.510> big<00:06:44.870> huge

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:45.380 
spokes and then i can hit make big huge

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:53.920 
spokes and then i can hit make big huge
polygons<00:06:45.980> on<00:06:46.190> the<00:06:46.280> other<00:06:46.460> side<00:06:52.660> so<00:06:53.660> far<00:06:53.900> i

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:53.930 
polygons on the other side so far i

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.660
