00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.490
 to check the switch on the 

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.790
 Water temperature is necessary to open 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.890
 the control panel disconnect the 

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.949
 power washer before 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:20.680
 proceed adjust the switch on the 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:24.220
 water temperature in warm water to 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.230
 wash and cold water to rinse put the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.699
 timer at the beginning of the cycle 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:33.600
 regular and have the button open the panel 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.600
 of the controls 

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:47.629
 configure a multimeter to read more 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.510
 120 volts AC 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.730
 connect the washing machine to the electrical outlet 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.100
 making sure your body is not in 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.519
 contact with any metal part in 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.949
 the washing machine put one of the tips of 

00:00:59.519 --> 00:01:04.320
 multimeter tests in contact with 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 the terminal of the white and red cable in 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.720
 the cable connection block 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.720
 feeding in this way and with the 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.040
 another test tip touch the terminal 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.260
 of the orange and black wire 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.190
 move the test tip to the wire 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:25.250
 gray the bel-air multimeter near 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.910
 120 volts of alternating current in the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:31.490
 two readings if it reads less than 100 volts 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:33.710
 of alternating current you have to 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:35.700
 check the level switch of the 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.920
 Water 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.520
 move the test tip to the wire 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.490
 violet and finally move the tip of 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.250
 Wire tanning tests 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.039
 bel-air multimeter close to 120 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.819
 volts of alternating current in the two 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:56.909
 readings if it reads less than 100 volts from 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.100
 alternating current you have to replace 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.219
 the temperature switch of the 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.219
 Water 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.490
 make sure the washing machine is 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:12.310
 disconnected from the outlet remove 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:15.400
 the switch button before 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.770
 remove the wires take pictures or do 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:21.310
 a drawing showing the position of the 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.740
 wires on the switch when you're 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:25.880
 sure remove the wires from 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:29.450
 switch 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.510
 I used a screwdriver to lift 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.320
 the tab and turn the switch and 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.320
 remove it put the new switch on 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.890
 your site turn it until it fits in your 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.650
 place 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.340
 connect the wires to the switch 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.340
 again 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.890
 the schematic diagram shows where 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:57.349
 the wires must be connected 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.470
 put the button to the new switch and 

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:04.810
 Close the controls panel and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.810
 secure it in place with the screws
