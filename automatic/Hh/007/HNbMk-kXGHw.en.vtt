make sure enough is put on to the
problem<00:00:43.350> areas<00:00:43.740> a<00:00:44.000> slight<00:00:45.000> build<00:00:45.210> up<00:00:45.420> is<00:00:45.570> okay

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
problem areas a slight build up is okay

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.350 
problem areas a slight build up is okay
as<00:00:46.260> it'll<00:00:46.740> be<00:00:46.830> sanded<00:00:47.370> smooth<00:00:47.700> for<00:00:48.000> painting

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
as it'll be sanded smooth for painting

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.810 
as it'll be sanded smooth for painting
and<00:00:48.540> the<00:00:49.230> next<00:00:49.470> step<00:00:49.680> is<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.280> let<00:00:50.400> it<00:00:50.460> dry

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
and the next step is to let it dry

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.270 
and the next step is to let it dry
overnight<00:00:51.440> alright<00:00:52.440> we've<00:00:52.650> let<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:52.980> epoxy
