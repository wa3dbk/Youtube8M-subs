just<00:02:28.330> cut<00:02:28.840> out<00:02:28.990> a<00:02:29.230> I<00:02:30.010> think<00:02:30.580> this<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.820> 2<00:02:30.970> inches

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
just cut out a I think this is 2 inches

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.490 
just cut out a I think this is 2 inches
a<00:02:31.860> two<00:02:32.860> inch<00:02:33.040> Mickey<00:02:33.550> head<00:02:33.730> and<00:02:33.970> I<00:02:34.930> painted<00:02:35.350> it

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500
