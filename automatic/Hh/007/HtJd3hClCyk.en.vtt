using a diamond Haxorus without rage
that's<00:03:34.950> hellish<00:03:35.519> man<00:03:35.820> 145<00:03:36.750> base<00:03:36.989> attack<00:03:37.260> is

that's hellish man 145 base attack is
huge<00:03:37.980> it's<00:03:38.280> gonna<00:03:38.370> be<00:03:38.550> big<00:03:38.790> so<00:03:39.690> anyway<00:03:40.050> I'm

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
huge it's gonna be big so anyway I'm

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.710 
huge it's gonna be big so anyway I'm
gonna<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:40.350> into<00:03:40.650> my<00:03:40.680> my<00:03:41.610> rash<00:03:41.940> EQ<00:03:42.390> room<00:03:42.510> here

which<00:03:42.900> is<00:03:42.989> my<00:03:43.110> white<00:03:43.320> kyurem<00:03:43.650> which<00:03:44.040> is<00:03:44.190> shiny

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:44.640 
which is my white kyurem which is shiny

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.430 
which is my white kyurem which is shiny
as<00:03:44.790> well<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:44.970> believe<00:03:45.269> so<00:03:45.810> it<00:03:45.989> looks<00:03:46.140> kind<00:03:46.380> of

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
as well I believe so it looks kind of

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.289 
as well I believe so it looks kind of
cool<00:03:46.650> actually<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.400> don't<00:03:47.580> think<00:03:47.760> it<00:03:47.850> is<00:03:47.970> shiny

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
cool actually I don't think it is shiny

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:50.300 
cool actually I don't think it is shiny
I<00:03:48.420> thought<00:03:48.660> I<00:03:48.690> made<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.110> I<00:03:49.440> can't<00:03:49.860> tell<00:03:50.130> at<00:03:50.250> this

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
I thought I made it I can't tell at this

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.070 
I thought I made it I can't tell at this
current<00:03:50.580> point<00:03:50.700> because<00:03:51.690> I<00:03:51.720> can't<00:03:51.989> really

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
current point because I can't really

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.539 
current point because I can't really
tell<00:03:52.290> the<00:03:52.470> difference<00:03:52.769> between<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.250> the

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
tell the difference between this and the

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.039 
tell the difference between this and the
real<00:03:53.760> one<00:03:54.000> it<00:03:54.150> might<00:03:54.269> be<00:03:54.420> shiny<00:03:54.630> it<00:03:54.780> might<00:03:54.900> not

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
real one it might be shiny it might not

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:57.740 
real one it might be shiny it might not
be<00:03:55.200> but<00:03:55.470> I<00:03:55.680> do<00:03:56.160> have<00:03:56.519> enough<00:03:56.730> bulk<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.360> live<00:03:57.540> a

would<00:04:03.750> have<00:04:03.840> been<00:04:03.930> fine<00:04:04.230> but<00:04:04.549> in<00:04:05.549> the<00:04:05.730> end<00:04:05.880> it's

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
would have been fine but in the end it's

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.460 
would have been fine but in the end it's
gonna<00:04:06.299> happen<00:04:06.510> that<00:04:06.690> way<00:04:06.840> and<00:04:07.260> unfortunately

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:20.100 
off on the Thunderbolt maybe I could

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:21.320 
off on the Thunderbolt maybe I could
have<00:04:20.190> lived<00:04:20.340> that<00:04:20.519> I<00:04:20.580> thought<00:04:20.940> because

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
have lived that I thought because

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.360 
have lived that I thought because

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
resistances but no it is a thunderous

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.740 
resistances but no it is a thunderous
and<00:04:23.490> it<00:04:24.180> has<00:04:24.349> 145<00:04:25.349> base<00:04:25.950> special

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750

with<00:04:43.610> recoil<00:04:44.030> so<00:04:44.210> that's<00:04:44.360> what<00:04:44.450> I<00:04:44.480> do<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.930> my

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
with recoil so that's what I do and my

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.620 
with recoil so that's what I do and my
plan<00:04:45.530> is<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.950> use<00:04:46.340> sky<00:04:46.790> attack<00:04:47.090> now<00:04:47.300> this<00:04:47.450> is<00:04:47.570> a

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:47.630 
plan is to use sky attack now this is a

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:49.900 
plan is to use sky attack now this is a
set<00:04:47.840> that<00:04:48.020> Nara<00:04:48.200> Nagi<00:04:48.530> gave<00:04:48.740> me<00:04:48.920> and<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.730> is<00:04:49.880> a

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:49.910 
set that Nara Nagi gave me and it is a

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:52.870 
set that Nara Nagi gave me and it is a
power<00:04:50.690> herb<00:04:51.050> sky<00:04:51.800> attack<00:04:52.100> set<00:04:52.460> so<00:04:52.700> that<00:04:52.730> you

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:52.880 
power herb sky attack set so that you

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.430 
power herb sky attack set so that you
get<00:04:53.090> to<00:04:53.210> use<00:04:53.270> sky<00:04:53.510> attack<00:04:53.690> straight<00:04:53.930> away<00:04:54.140> and

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
get to use sky attack straight away and

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.740 
get to use sky attack straight away and
the<00:04:55.310> problem<00:04:55.610> here<00:04:55.790> is<00:04:55.850> I<00:04:56.090> thought<00:04:56.510> I'd<00:04:56.630> be

00:04:56.740 --> 00:04:56.750 
the problem here is I thought I'd be

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:58.150 
the problem here is I thought I'd be
able<00:04:56.870> to<00:04:56.960> kill<00:04:57.110> him<00:04:57.170> from<00:04:57.290> this<00:04:57.440> range<00:04:57.710> why<00:04:58.130> I

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
able to kill him from this range why I

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.220 
able to kill him from this range why I
go<00:04:58.400> for<00:04:58.580> the<00:04:58.640> sky<00:04:58.790> attack<00:04:59.030> now<00:04:59.210> I<00:04:59.390> should<00:05:00.110> have

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
go for the sky attack now I should have

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:01.570 
go for the sky attack now I should have
subbed<00:05:00.470> again<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.950> thought<00:05:01.160> I<00:05:01.220> didn't<00:05:01.550> have

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
subbed again I thought I didn't have

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.250 
subbed again I thought I didn't have
enough<00:05:01.880> HP<00:05:02.240> for<00:05:02.419> another<00:05:02.600> sub<00:05:02.810> but<00:05:02.990> it<00:05:03.080> turns

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:03.260 
enough HP for another sub but it turns

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:04.900 
enough HP for another sub but it turns
out<00:05:03.440> that<00:05:03.620> I<00:05:03.680> did<00:05:04.010> have<00:05:04.190> enough<00:05:04.430> HP<00:05:04.760> for

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
out that I did have enough HP for

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.820 
out that I did have enough HP for
another<00:05:05.090> sub<00:05:05.330> and<00:05:05.690> had<00:05:05.900> i<00:05:05.930> subbed<00:05:06.290> again<00:05:06.620> I

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
another sub and had i subbed again I

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.400 
another sub and had i subbed again I
would<00:05:07.400> have<00:05:07.490> been<00:05:07.640> able<00:05:07.820> to<00:05:08.030> not<00:05:08.480> only<00:05:08.630> live

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.410 
would have been able to not only live

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:12.340 
would have been able to not only live
the<00:05:09.830> the<00:05:09.860> next<00:05:10.640> life<00:05:11.210> will<00:05:11.390> recoil<00:05:11.870> because<00:05:12.200> I

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
the the next life will recoil because I

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.140 
the the next life will recoil because I
had<00:05:12.530> a<00:05:12.560> Saab<00:05:12.800> up<00:05:12.980> I'd<00:05:13.340> have<00:05:13.490> then<00:05:13.640> been<00:05:13.850> able<00:05:13.940> to

had a Saab up I'd have then been able to

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.970 
had a Saab up I'd have then been able to
go<00:05:14.300> for<00:05:14.450> the<00:05:14.510> sky<00:05:14.750> attack<00:05:15.050> and<00:05:15.290> then<00:05:15.560> he<00:05:15.800> would

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:15.980 
go for the sky attack and then he would

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:17.500 
go for the sky attack and then he would
have<00:05:16.040> killed<00:05:16.280> him<00:05:16.460> off<00:05:16.610> on<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.090> following

will<00:05:19.910> recoil<00:05:20.270> because<00:05:20.690> as<00:05:20.900> you<00:05:21.050> can<00:05:21.140> see<00:05:21.200> you

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:21.980 
will recoil because as you can see you

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.440 
will recoil because as you can see you
know<00:05:22.100> it's<00:05:22.370> gonna<00:05:22.520> go<00:05:22.669> down<00:05:22.880> here<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.210> you

know it's gonna go down here and you
know<00:05:23.720> the<00:05:23.930> extra<00:05:24.230> damage<00:05:24.500> would<00:05:24.620> have<00:05:24.680> helped

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:24.980 
know the extra damage would have helped

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:27.820 
know the extra damage would have helped
but<00:05:25.430> it<00:05:25.669> doesn't<00:05:25.910> work<00:05:26.030> that<00:05:26.090> way<00:05:26.330> and<00:05:26.830> things

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:27.830 
but it doesn't work that way and things

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.080 
but it doesn't work that way and things

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
and spade and I both thought that

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.260 
and spade and I both thought that
Calvillo<00:05:39.800> would<00:05:39.979> out<00:05:40.100> speed<00:05:40.460> thunderous

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:41.270 
Calvillo would out speed thunderous

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:43.600 
Calvillo would out speed thunderous
simply<00:05:41.690> because<00:05:41.990> thunderous<00:05:42.650> now<00:05:42.860> has<00:05:43.100> 101

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:43.610 
simply because thunderous now has 101

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:46.630 
simply because thunderous now has 101
base<00:05:44.450> speed<00:05:44.780> with<00:05:45.200> this<00:05:45.380> form<00:05:45.650> but<00:05:46.040> apparently

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:46.640 
base speed with this form but apparently

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:48.880

you<00:05:47.479> know<00:05:47.600> I<00:05:47.870> don't<00:05:48.200> out<00:05:48.320> speed<00:05:48.590> him<00:05:48.710> and<00:05:48.800> he

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
you know I don't out speed him and he

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:49.900 
you know I don't out speed him and he
asked<00:05:49.070> me<00:05:49.220> he's<00:05:49.310> mean<00:05:49.430> he<00:05:49.520> just<00:05:49.550> kind<00:05:49.820> of
