00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:05.540
 hello how about you guys welcome to this 

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:07.790
 third informative video of the channel and 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.350
 well if it 's the third of two that I made 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:14.720
 many months ago and these videos were going 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.240
 to do every time something happens here 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.460
 in the channel and then on this occasion as 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.170
 you will have noticed I got used to 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.660
 be uploading videos every day 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.390
 but about two or three days ago I did not 

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:28.609
 I upload videos and I wanted to do this for 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.470
 tell them not to worry I'm going to 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.090
 keep going up is that there are people who 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.600
 he says he asks me 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.040
 it was just because he was busy apart from 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.580
 that also I mentioned by twitter and 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.200
 facebook that I just formatted my pc what 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:46.260
 which I really like because I already had 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.630
 enough problems but something bad can 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.030
 be that I took to make more videos 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.750
 because I have to reinstall 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.730
 programs configure many things but 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.680
 I already did all that supposedly already 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.629
 I should be able to record well so I'm going to 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 try to return with the videos other 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.250
 I also wanted to take advantage for the 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.470
 people who ask me about the series 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.840
 I have not abandoned any 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.080

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:15.960

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.910
 I just do not have that much time 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.300
 I 'm losing time because I'm late 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.490
 edit in render and upload the video 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.270

 enter the group so I have that 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.940
 deactivated until the chat I do not have 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.610

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.520
