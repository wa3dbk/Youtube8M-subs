picture of a my polarity tester that is
what<00:04:24.950> they<00:04:25.100> had<00:04:25.340> in<00:04:25.670> the<00:04:25.940> 50s<00:04:26.450> and<00:04:26.720> yes<00:04:27.680> even<00:04:27.920> in

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
what they had in the 50s and yes even in

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.170 
what they had in the 50s and yes even in
a<00:04:28.220> 61<00:04:29.150> they<00:04:29.360> still<00:04:29.630> had<00:04:30.460> in<00:04:31.460> other<00:04:31.610> words<00:04:31.850> are

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
a 61 they still had in other words are

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.590 
a 61 they still had in other words are
they<00:04:32.510> switch<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.810> polarity<00:04:33.169> of<00:04:33.500> the<00:04:33.590> magnets

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
they switch the polarity of the magnets

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.980 
they switch the polarity of the magnets
as<00:04:35.600> they<00:04:35.960> were<00:04:36.020> into<00:04:36.470> the<00:04:36.590> six

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
as they were into the six

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:39.680 
as they were into the six
but<00:04:37.290> even<00:04:37.440> a<00:04:37.620> 61<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.340> still<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.760> the<00:04:39.450> North

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
but even a 61 you still have the North

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.910 
but even a 61 you still have the North
clarity<00:04:40.530> magnets<00:04:41.390> that's<00:04:42.390> just<00:04:42.680> so<00:04:43.680> it's<00:04:43.830> like

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
clarity magnets that's just so it's like

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.090 
clarity magnets that's just so it's like
in<00:04:44.040> 1959<00:04:44.820> slab<00:04:45.180> board<00:04:45.740> because<00:04:46.740> they<00:04:46.980> would

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:47.100 
in 1959 slab board because they would

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:53.620 
in 1959 slab board because they would
have<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> North<00:04:49.790> that<00:04:50.790> has<00:04:51.000> one<00:04:51.270> sweet

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
have the North that has one sweet

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.600 
have the North that has one sweet
