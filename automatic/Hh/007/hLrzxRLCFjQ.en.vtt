works it has one out and stereo in Y

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.980 
works it has one out and stereo in Y
Jack<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.950> back<00:01:50.190> into<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.060> anyway

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990

Jack to get back into it and anyway
let's<00:01:52.260> let's<00:01:52.860> try<00:01:53.040> something<00:01:53.490> here<00:01:53.670> you<00:02:05.780> know

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
let's let's try something here you know

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.920 
let's let's try something here you know
that's<00:02:07.080> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> loop<00:02:07.530> through<00:02:08.930> mistakes

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
that's going to loop through mistakes

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.520 
that's going to loop through mistakes
and<00:02:10.170> all<00:02:10.760> and<00:02:11.810> we're<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.990> to<00:02:13.020> switch<00:02:13.290> over

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
and all and we're going to switch over

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.430 
and all and we're going to switch over
to<00:02:13.710> the<00:02:13.980> lean<00:02:14.190> channel<00:02:15.080> just<00:02:16.080> so<00:02:16.260> you<00:02:16.320> know

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
to the lean channel just so you know

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:24.740 
to the lean channel just so you know
that<00:02:16.920> peer<00:02:17.510> loop<00:02:18.510> is<00:02:18.750> gonna<00:02:19.080> stay<00:02:19.350> clean

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.930 

Katya<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:26.530> drive<00:02:26.890> into<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:29.220> bleep<00:02:30.220> master<00:02:30.489> at

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
Katya we drive into and bleep master at

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.979 
Katya we drive into and bleep master at
love<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.900> third<00:02:32.319> from<00:02:33.040> one<00:02:33.450> you'll<00:02:34.450> find<00:02:34.780> that

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
love a third from one you'll find that

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.240 
love a third from one you'll find that
this<00:02:35.520> raises<00:02:36.520> the<00:02:36.760> volume<00:02:37.239> very<00:02:37.630> rapidly<00:02:38.250> so

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
this raises the volume very rapidly so

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:51.690 
this raises the volume very rapidly so
we<00:02:39.489> get<00:02:39.730> very<00:02:40.620> much

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.099 

let's<00:02:52.700> switch<00:02:52.969> to<00:02:52.999> the<00:02:53.269> lien<00:02:53.480> picked<00:02:53.780> up<00:02:53.900> and

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
let's switch to the lien picked up and

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:09.759 
let's switch to the lien picked up and
get<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.290> little<00:02:54.590> more<00:02:54.739> volume<00:03:08.349> now<00:03:09.349> here's

00:03:09.759 --> 00:03:09.769 
get a little more volume now here's

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.110 
get a little more volume now here's
something<00:03:10.489> interesting

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
something interesting

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.729 
something interesting
we're<00:03:11.239> gonna<00:03:11.389> turn<00:03:11.599> up<00:03:11.780> the<00:03:11.840> reverb<00:03:12.260> so<00:03:12.500> far

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
we're gonna turn up the reverb so far

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:24.339 
we're gonna turn up the reverb so far
it's<00:03:12.859> been<00:03:12.920> all<00:03:13.159> live<00:03:22.540> and<00:03:23.540> I'm<00:03:23.659> gonna<00:03:23.780> get<00:03:24.230> the

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:24.349 
it's been all live and I'm gonna get the

00:03:24.349 --> 00:03:33.599 
it's been all live and I'm gonna get the
loop<00:03:24.530> again<00:03:24.799> add<00:03:25.579> this<00:03:25.849> what's<00:03:26.359> already<00:03:26.569> there

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:36.069 

by<00:03:34.609> the<00:03:34.699> time<00:03:34.969> we<00:03:35.120> come<00:03:35.299> back<00:03:35.599> to<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.930> kitchen

you're<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:42.660> reverb<00:03:43.019> is<00:03:43.170> smelling<00:03:43.860> the<00:03:43.950> delay

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.130 

so<00:04:00.000> let's<00:04:00.209> take<00:04:00.390> a<00:04:00.420> look<00:04:00.629> at<00:04:00.750> a<00:04:00.780> couple<00:04:00.959> other

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:01.140 
so let's take a look at a couple other

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:08.600 
so let's take a look at a couple other
things

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:08.610 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.409 

yeah

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:16.419 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:31.230 

the<00:04:17.229> sound<00:04:17.469> quite<00:04:17.769> a<00:04:17.799> bit<00:04:17.979> as<00:04:18.099> you<00:04:18.219> can<00:04:18.370> see

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:40.320 

Weaver

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.659 

now<00:04:40.750> you'll<00:04:40.990> see<00:04:41.229> what<00:04:41.259> I<00:04:41.379> mean<00:04:41.590> about

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:45.669 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:52.200 

while<00:04:46.669> I'm<00:04:46.789> jumping<00:04:47.239> radically

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:57.519 

ciao

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:57.529 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:10.030 

it<00:04:58.159> has<00:04:58.429> no<00:04:58.669> effect<00:04:58.789> in<00:04:59.179> the<00:04:59.299> leader<00:04:59.509> bottom

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:20.690 

you

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:28.290 

Oh

00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.300 

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.930 

by<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.320> way<00:05:29.410> I've<00:05:29.500> also<00:05:29.650> used<00:05:30.040> these<00:05:30.400> this<00:05:30.820> is

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:30.940 
by the way I've also used these this is

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:32.640 
by the way I've also used these this is
about<00:05:31.120> the<00:05:31.300> third<00:05:31.480> one<00:05:31.630> I've<00:05:31.780> owned<00:05:31.930> now<00:05:32.110> I've

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:32.650 
about the third one I've owned now I've

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:37.080 
about the third one I've owned now I've
also<00:05:33.520> used<00:05:34.000> these<00:05:34.330> with<00:05:34.660> the<00:05:35.050> Mesa<00:05:36.090> 5050

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
also used these with the Mesa 5050

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.180 
also used these with the Mesa 5050
instead<00:05:37.810> of<00:05:37.930> the<00:05:38.050> strategy<00:05:38.530> four<00:05:38.800> hundred<00:05:39.100> it

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
instead of the strategy four hundred it

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.460 
instead of the strategy four hundred it
makes<00:05:39.400> a<00:05:39.520> nice<00:05:39.700> combination<00:05:40.230> right<00:05:41.230> now<00:05:41.410> the

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
makes a nice combination right now the

00:05:41.470 --> 00:06:06.710 
makes a nice combination right now the
strategies<00:05:42.460> is<00:05:43.000> what<00:05:43.180> I've<00:05:43.270> been<00:05:43.300> using

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:06.720 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:49.370 

let's<00:06:07.110> give<00:06:07.290> it<00:06:07.380> a<00:06:07.440> lot<00:06:07.590> more<00:06:07.620> lead<00:06:08.010> drive

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:53.280 

all<00:06:50.380> right<00:06:50.560> that<00:06:50.740> ought<00:06:50.889> to<00:06:50.919> be<00:06:51.100> enough
