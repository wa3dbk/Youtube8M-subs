00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:45.710 

it<00:01:44.610> looks<00:01:44.820> as<00:01:44.970> though<00:01:45.000> someone<00:01:45.120> threw<00:01:45.600> his

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
it looks as though someone threw his

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.420 
it looks as though someone threw his
head<00:01:45.840> against<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.229> lockup<00:01:46.560> animal<00:01:47.040> enough

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
head against in lockup animal enough

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.820 
head against in lockup animal enough
force<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:47.729> nearly<00:01:47.970> came<00:01:48.240> in<00:01:48.360> a<00:01:48.390> skull<00:01:48.720> this<00:01:49.590> was

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:49.830 
force to nearly came in a skull this was

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:57.789 
force to nearly came in a skull this was
absolutely<00:01:50.280> no<00:01:50.490> accident

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.130 

if<00:01:58.310> it<00:01:58.640> is<00:01:58.820> a<00:01:58.850> virus<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.420> I<00:01:59.450> think<00:01:59.689> that<00:01:59.869> it<00:01:59.960> is

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
if it is a virus and I think that it is

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.020 
if it is a virus and I think that it is
and<00:02:00.979> it's<00:02:01.130> likely<00:02:01.310> spreading<00:02:01.789> its<00:02:01.909> way

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
and it's likely spreading its way

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:04.419 
and it's likely spreading its way
through<00:02:02.240> Xen<00:02:02.450> will<00:02:02.659> one<00:02:02.899> system<00:02:03.380> at<00:02:03.500> a<00:02:03.560> time<00:02:03.590> my
