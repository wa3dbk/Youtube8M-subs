00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:07.870
 Hahaha 

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:24.740
 for life 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.650
 you know which is the largest plane in the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.080
 world this title is shared by two 

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:39.070
 European aircraft a cargo and the 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:43.210
 another passenger and they are the airbus a380 and 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.970
 the antonov an225 the a380 is manufactured 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.910
 by the multinational euros this aircraft 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.890
 could carry up to 853 passengers in 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.809
 tourist class however if the 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.850
 Cabin configuration outside made 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:57.129
 to carry the same time passengers in 

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.949
 business class tourist and first 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.650
 the a380 could carry between 500 and 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.540
 550 passengers which makes it the 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.220
 largest commercial aircraft in the world 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.659
 beating his closest rival 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:13.720
 commercial on 27 47 this plane has 73 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.860
 meters in length and 24 in height can 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.200
 travel a distance of 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.630
 approximately 15,200 kilometers 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.729
 for each refueling and arrives 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.229
 to develop a cruising speed of 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.229
 900 kilometers per hour 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.210
 meanwhile the n 225 is the plane of 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.640
 The world's largest cargo is manufactured 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:36.560
 by the Ukrainian antonov company and it was 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.390
 originally conceived to move 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.580
 to the Soviet space shuttle 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.400
 durÃ¡n this aircraft has a weight 

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.020
 approximately 640 tons and due to 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.090
 his enormous size he had to 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.010
 make certain special modifications 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.080
 for example it has a train of 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.360
 32-wheel landing plus 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.700
 They eliminated the rear door and ramp 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.010
 to save weight and instead of counting 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.170
 with a single stabilizer spoiler in the 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.479
 back tail was adapted a tail 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.340
 double with a horizontal stabilizer 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.200
 large proportions although in a 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.750
 principle had been considered to manufacture 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.550
 only two aircraft of this type only 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.220
 one was concluded and put into service 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.170
 however after the fall of the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.150
 Soviet Union and cancellation 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.190
 much of the space program the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.050
 antonov was semi dismantled no 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.700
 However, in recent years it has returned to 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:24.140
 start working since it was 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.840
 rented by a company to perform 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.459
 high freight air freight and due to 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.800
 the great demand that the services of 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:33.020
 this colossus of the air had had 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.150
 proposed the completion of the second plane 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:39.040
 and even Russia has contemplated a 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.040
 program to manufacture them in cebit
