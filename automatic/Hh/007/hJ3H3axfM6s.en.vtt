your vehicle and that is onboard air

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.970 
your vehicle and that is onboard air
there's<00:00:12.960> many<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.200> air<00:00:13.440> sources<00:00:13.860> you

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
there's many different air sources you

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.560 
there's many different air sources you
could<00:00:14.219> choose<00:00:14.519> from<00:00:14.549> on<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.000> market<00:00:15.420> so

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
could choose from on the market so

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.330 
could choose from on the market so
picking<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:15.960> right<00:00:16.410> air<00:00:16.680> compressor<00:00:17.160> for

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
picking the right air compressor for

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.680 
picking the right air compressor for
your<00:00:17.430> vehicle<00:00:17.820> is<00:00:17.940> really<00:00:18.210> important

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
your vehicle is really important

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.000 
your vehicle is really important
typically<00:00:19.380> you<00:00:19.439> want<00:00:19.529> something<00:00:19.859> that's

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
typically you want something that's

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:20.990 
typically you want something that's
going<00:00:20.130> to<00:00:20.189> cope<00:00:20.400> with<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.640> harsh<00:00:20.820> environment

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
going to cope with the harsh environment

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.490 
going to cope with the harsh environment
that<00:00:21.570> you<00:00:21.630> want<00:00:21.779> to<00:00:21.840> take<00:00:21.990> the<00:00:22.140> vehicle

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
that you want to take the vehicle

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.650 
that you want to take the vehicle
through<00:00:22.650> itself<00:00:23.070> compressors<00:00:24.060> like<00:00:24.180> this<00:00:24.449> one

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
through itself compressors like this one

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.300 
through itself compressors like this one
are<00:00:24.810> mounted<00:00:25.170> outside<00:00:25.289> of<00:00:25.710> the<00:00:25.800> vehicle<00:00:26.189> and

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
are mounted outside of the vehicle and

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.679 
are mounted outside of the vehicle and
so<00:00:26.430> therefore<00:00:26.609> they're<00:00:26.910> going<00:00:26.939> to<00:00:27.090> cop<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
so therefore they're going to cop the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.259 
so therefore they're going to cop the
water<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.380> rain<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:29.010> dust<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.519> gravel<00:00:30.000> and

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
water the rain the dust the gravel and

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.759 
water the rain the dust the gravel and
everything<00:00:30.570> else<00:00:30.720> that<00:00:30.990> the<00:00:31.109> vehicle<00:00:31.500> itself

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
everything else that the vehicle itself

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.620 
everything else that the vehicle itself
is<00:00:31.949> getting<00:00:32.040> subjected<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.820> a<00:00:32.910> daily<00:00:33.180> basis

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
is getting subjected to in a daily basis

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.569 
is getting subjected to in a daily basis
well<00:00:34.079> therefore<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.649> well-designed<00:00:35.280> air

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
well therefore a well-designed air

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.150 
well therefore a well-designed air
compressor<00:00:36.149> is<00:00:36.420> going<00:00:36.719> to<00:00:36.780> need<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.110> be<00:00:37.290> highly

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
also got to be shock resistant it's

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.360 
also got to be shock resistant it's
going<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.930> taking<00:00:43.230> a<00:00:43.320> lot<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:43.559> road<00:00:44.040> shock

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
going to be taking a lot of road shock

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.190 
going to be taking a lot of road shock
as<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.610> vehicle<00:00:44.940> travels<00:00:45.270> over<00:00:45.480> corrugations

there<00:01:03.780> when<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.739> need<00:01:04.920> it<00:01:04.949> every<00:01:05.250> time<00:01:05.729> you

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
there when you need it every time you

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.969

also want to consider something like

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.010 
also want to consider something like
