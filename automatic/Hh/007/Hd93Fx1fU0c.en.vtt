works<00:01:09.720> best<00:01:10.020> for<00:01:10.380> you<00:01:10.880> now<00:01:11.880> spread<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:12.390> butter

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
works best for you now spread the butter

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.200 
works best for you now spread the butter
evenly<00:01:12.930> over<00:01:13.530> one<00:01:14.040> side<00:01:14.400> of<00:01:14.430> each<00:01:14.850> of<00:01:15.090> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
evenly over one side of each of the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.740 
evenly over one side of each of the
slices<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.619> give<00:01:16.950> them<00:01:17.100> both<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.490> flip<00:01:17.790> and<00:01:18.030> we

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
slices then give them both a flip and we

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.990 
slices then give them both a flip and we
can<00:01:18.900> start<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.350> put<00:01:19.530> this<00:01:19.650> together

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
can start to put this together

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.570 
can start to put this together
okay<00:01:21.900> now<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.110> first<00:01:22.380> trick<00:01:22.800> is<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.130> put<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
okay now the first trick is to put the

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.480 
okay now the first trick is to put the
cheese<00:01:23.850> on<00:01:24.150> both<00:01:24.540> sides<00:01:24.900> of<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.290> sandwich<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
cheese on both sides of the sandwich to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.420 
cheese on both sides of the sandwich to
act<00:01:26.700> as<00:01:26.910> a<00:01:26.940> moisture<00:01:27.420> barrier<00:01:27.630> as<00:01:28.020> a<00:01:28.080> grill<00:01:28.680> now

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
act as a moisture barrier as a grill now

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.730 
act as a moisture barrier as a grill now
sprinkle<00:01:29.850> over<00:01:30.090> some<00:01:30.510> salt<00:01:30.870> pepper<00:01:31.410> and

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
sprinkle over some salt pepper and

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.640 
sprinkle over some salt pepper and
ribbons<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.580> fresh<00:01:32.820> basil<00:01:33.320> until<00:01:34.320> you've<00:01:34.440> got

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
ribbons of fresh basil until you've got

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.609 
ribbons of fresh basil until you've got
pretty<00:01:34.860> even<00:01:35.370> coverage<00:01:35.960> then<00:01:36.960> layer<00:01:37.260> some

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
pretty even coverage then layer some

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
pretty even coverage then layer some
thin<00:01:37.890> slices<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.610> tomato<00:01:39.000> onto<00:01:39.540> each<00:01:39.750> side<00:01:40.110> and

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
thin slices of tomato onto each side and

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.920 
thin slices of tomato onto each side and
this<00:01:41.130> will<00:01:41.340> help<00:01:41.369> to<00:01:41.729> rehydrate<00:01:42.060> the<00:01:42.450> leftover

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
this will help to rehydrate the leftover

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.500 
this will help to rehydrate the leftover
chicken<00:01:43.200> which<00:01:44.040> can<00:01:44.310> be<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.490> bit<00:01:44.760> dry<00:01:45.090> but

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
chicken which can be a bit dry but

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.960 
chicken which can be a bit dry but
before<00:01:46.320> we<00:01:46.440> add<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.890> chicken<00:01:47.340> we'll<00:01:47.729> give<00:01:47.940> it

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
before we add that chicken we'll give it

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.359 
before we add that chicken we'll give it
a<00:01:48.090> little<00:01:48.360> more<00:01:48.570> help<00:01:48.869> with<00:01:49.710> some<00:01:49.979> salt<00:01:50.280> and

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
a little more help with some salt and

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.749 
a little more help with some salt and
pepper<00:01:50.700> a<00:01:51.200> drizzle<00:01:52.200> of<00:01:52.260> balsamic<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.550> touch

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
pepper a drizzle of balsamic and a touch

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
pepper a drizzle of balsamic and a touch
of<00:01:53.940> olive<00:01:54.180> oil<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.770> second<00:01:56.190> trick<00:01:56.430> is<00:01:56.670> to

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
of olive oil and the second trick is to

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.520 
of olive oil and the second trick is to
do<00:01:57.060> that<00:01:57.090> while<00:01:57.509> it's<00:01:57.690> still<00:01:57.960> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.229> plate

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
do that while it's still on the plate

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.240 
do that while it's still on the plate
and<00:01:58.770> not<00:01:59.460> pour<00:01:59.759> directly<00:01:59.880> onto<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.509> sandwich

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
and not pour directly onto the sandwich

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.350 
and not pour directly onto the sandwich
because<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> runoff<00:02:02.729> would<00:02:03.000> make<00:02:03.180> your

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
because the runoff would make your

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:06.200 
because the runoff would make your
panini<00:02:03.690> a<00:02:03.930> soggy<00:02:04.350> mess<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.220> once<00:02:05.880> you've<00:02:06.030> got

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
panini a soggy mess and once you've got

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.449 
panini a soggy mess and once you've got
good<00:02:06.390> coverage<00:02:06.690> with<00:02:07.080> the<00:02:07.200> chicken<00:02:07.619> put<00:02:08.429> the

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
good coverage with the chicken put the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.460 
good coverage with the chicken put the
sandwich<00:02:09.000> together<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.810> we'll<00:02:10.140> hit<00:02:10.320> the

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
sandwich together and we'll hit the

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.490 
sandwich together and we'll hit the
grill<00:02:10.709> and<00:02:11.100> I'm<00:02:12.060> using<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.540> cast-iron<00:02:13.050> grill

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
grill and I'm using a cast-iron grill

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.820 
grill and I'm using a cast-iron grill
pan<00:02:13.770> over<00:02:14.760> a<00:02:14.790> medium<00:02:14.880> low<00:02:15.600> heat<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:16.080> that

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
pan over a medium low heat and that

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.220 
pan over a medium low heat and that
lower<00:02:17.130> heat<00:02:17.459> is<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:17.820> third<00:02:18.060> trick<00:02:18.420> because

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
lower heat is the third trick because

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.930 
lower heat is the third trick because
you<00:02:19.500> want<00:02:19.680> to<00:02:19.770> give<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.040> cheese<00:02:20.310> plenty<00:02:20.850> of

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
time to melt before the bread gets too

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.670 
time to melt before the bread gets too
