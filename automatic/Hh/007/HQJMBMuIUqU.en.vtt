00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.816
 Prostate vs. plants" 

00:00:04.286 --> 00:00:05.985
 According to a recent expert opinion, it is 

00:00:05.985 --> 00:00:07.782
 “The most significant development in the enlargement epidemic 

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:11.678
 prostate and lower urinary tract symptoms 

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:15.065
 For us, knowing that the influential risk factors of lifestyle considerably 

00:00:15.065 --> 00:00:19.025
 influences the natural development of these conditions. " 

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.836
 These are factors associated with increased risk: 

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.735
 obesity, diabetes, meat and fat. 

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.495
 Some are associated with reduced risk: 

00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:29.959
 movement, moderate alcohol consumption and vegetables. 

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:31.628
 What vegetables? 

00:00:31.628 --> 00:00:34.864
 Garlic and onion look effective. 

00:00:34.864 --> 00:00:38.330
 I like how consumers call "onion users" here. 

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.355
 Cooked vegetables seem to work even better than raw vegetables. 

00:00:41.355 --> 00:00:44.110
 Maybe it's carotenoids. 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.867
 Even legumes have protective effects: 

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:49.042
 peas, beans and beans, lentils. 

00:00:49.042 --> 00:00:51.615
 Flax seeds seem strong enough 

00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:56.834
 that they can be used to prevent and treat this disease. 

00:00:56.834 --> 00:00:59.914
 A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial found 

00:00:59.914 --> 00:01:04.242
 that flaxseed phytonutrients not only alleviate the symptoms of benign prostate hypertrophy, 

00:01:04.242 --> 00:01:09.479
 but their effectiveness even appeared to be comparable to that of the drugs we spend on it 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.647
 billions of dollars, plus no side effects. 

00:01:11.647 --> 00:01:15.616
 Flax seeds also act against prostate cancer. 

00:01:15.616 --> 00:01:19.441
 These scientists chose men to undergo surgical removal of the prostate. 

00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:25.121
 They gave them the task of eating three tablespoons of flax seeds a few weeks before surgery. 

00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:29.703
 Scientists had doubts about any effects on tumor biology. 

00:01:29.703 --> 00:01:34.075
 They did not believe they would find the difference between the flax-treated group and the control group 

00:01:34.075 --> 00:01:37.603
 since the experiment was really short. 

00:01:37.603 --> 00:01:40.993
 However, they found that there was a significant slowdown in cancer cell division as well 

00:01:40.993 --> 00:01:45.031
 significant increase in apoptosis, controlled cell death, in this case 

00:01:45.031 --> 00:01:47.488
 cancer cells. I told you about that before. 

00:01:47.488 --> 00:01:51.046
 So these findings suggest that flax seeds along with a low fat diet 

00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:55.834
 may affect the biology of prostate cancer. 

00:01:55.834 --> 00:01:58.953
 Only a few things were found to be unfavorable 

00:01:58.953 --> 00:02:02.155
 effect, significantly increased disease risk: 

00:02:02.155 --> 00:02:04.397
 refined cereals (like white bread) 

00:02:04.397 --> 00:02:07.249
 and eggs with poultry meat. 

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:11.158
 This turned out to be even more harmful than red meat and desserts! 

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:14.557
 “Although the knowledge is based on observation and more needs to be done 

00:02:14.557 --> 00:02:17.053
 research, the promotion of favorable lifestyle changes has little, 

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:19.488
 if any, disadvantages. 

00:02:19.488 --> 00:02:22.524
 Such a change is weight loss, enough exercise, reduced meat and fat intake 

00:02:22.524 --> 00:02:24.323
 and increasing the intake of vegetables in patients 

00:02:24.323 --> 00:02:26.761
 with a prostate. 

00:02:26.761 --> 00:02:29.612
 This is a good choice, especially since these lifestyle changes are confirmed 

00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:32.832
 beneficial effects on the overall health and condition of the cardiovascular system. " 

00:02:32.832 --> 00:02:36.219
 And what to do before you are not a patient with a sick prostate? 

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.624
 “Lifestyle habits associated with reduced risk of clinical development 

00:02:40.624 --> 00:02:43.683
 Prostate enlargement is most likely beneficial as well 

00:02:43.683 --> 00:02:47.613
 to reduce the risk of erectile dysfunction, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. 

00:02:47.613 --> 00:02:51.456
 For this reason, urologists should encourage all men 

00:02:51.456 --> 00:02:55.777
 to adopt a lifestyle that thrives on the prostate. ”
