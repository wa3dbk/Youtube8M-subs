and the natural crease line kind of just

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.080

lips<00:02:52.610> quite<00:02:52.880> natural<00:02:53.330> looking<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:53.930> if<00:02:54.650> you

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:54.770 
lips quite natural looking and if you

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.430

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
have a nice natural lip shape you could

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.260 
have a nice natural lip shape you could
probably<00:02:57.620> just<00:02:57.920> get<00:02:58.220> away<00:02:58.370> with<00:02:58.670> using<00:02:58.850> a<00:02:59.060> lip

00:02:59.260 --> 00:02:59.270 
probably just get away with using a lip

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.740 
probably just get away with using a lip
gloss<00:02:59.510> or<00:02:59.870> lip<00:03:00.680> balm<00:03:00.950> or<00:03:01.220> something<00:03:01.640> but<00:03:02.540> I

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
gloss or lip balm or something but I

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.870

don't<00:03:02.870> have<00:03:03.260> a<00:03:03.290> top<00:03:03.530> lip<00:03:03.739> line<00:03:03.950> so<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> always

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
don't have a top lip line so I always

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.910 
don't have a top lip line so I always
like<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.150> define<00:03:05.540> mine<00:03:05.810> a<00:03:05.840> little<00:03:06.140> bit<00:03:06.290> but

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
like to define mine a little bit but

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.920 
like to define mine a little bit but
because<00:03:07.220> I<00:03:07.340> don't<00:03:07.400> do<00:03:07.670> natural<00:03:08.150> I<00:03:08.360> don't<00:03:08.720> own

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
because I don't do natural I don't own

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.530

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
going over with a lip balm on a lip

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.990 
going over with a lip balm on a lip
brush<00:03:21.410> and<00:03:21.650> just<00:03:22.220> blending<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.610> across<00:03:22.820> the

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
brush and just blending it across the

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.270 
for this look I didn't really want to
console<00:03:29.360> my<00:03:29.480> face<00:03:29.690> because<00:03:30.620> my<00:03:30.800> face<00:03:31.010> is<00:03:31.040> quite

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:33.770 
angular when I contour it gives me more

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.490 
angular when I contour it gives me more
of<00:03:33.830> a<00:03:33.950> kind<00:03:34.160> of<00:03:34.340> fierce<00:03:34.880> look<00:03:35.209> and<00:03:35.480> I<00:03:36.260> wanted
