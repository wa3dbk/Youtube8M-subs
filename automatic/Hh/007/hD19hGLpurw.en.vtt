lightning fast
up<00:00:12.540> until<00:00:12.750> that<00:00:13.080> wreck<00:00:13.290> and<00:00:13.559> when<00:00:15.170> when<00:00:16.170> we<00:00:16.260> hit

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
up until that wreck and when when we hit

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.840 
up until that wreck and when when we hit
the<00:00:17.310> sixteen<00:00:17.960> it<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.230> knocked<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> toe<00:00:19.740> out

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
the sixteen it just knocked the toe out

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.070 
the sixteen it just knocked the toe out
and<00:00:20.850> the<00:00:20.939> car<00:00:21.119> just<00:00:21.150> didn't<00:00:21.570> drive<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.750> same

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
and the car just didn't drive the same

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 
and the car just didn't drive the same
for<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.680> rest<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.949> the<00:00:23.010> day<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.449> we<00:00:24.449> did<00:00:24.600> our

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
for the rest of the day and we did our

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.960 
for the rest of the day and we did our
best<00:00:24.750> to<00:00:25.019> try<00:00:25.080> to<00:00:25.260> repair<00:00:25.769> it<00:00:25.820> but<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
best to try to repair it but it just

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.939 
best to try to repair it but it just
wasn't<00:00:27.300> as<00:00:27.750> fast<00:00:28.019> as<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:28.619> was<00:00:28.740> before<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:30.949> you

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
wasn't as fast as it was before so you

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.400 
wasn't as fast as it was before so you
know<00:00:32.009> product<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.640> back<00:00:32.790> qualifying<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:34.260> know

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
know product to back qualifying you know

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.010 
know product to back qualifying you know
but<00:00:34.800> we<00:00:35.550> still<00:00:35.790> we<00:00:36.000> were<00:00:36.059> right<00:00:36.719> around<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
but we still we were right around the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.190 
but we still we were right around the
top<00:00:37.140> ten<00:00:37.380> when<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.649> happened<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.940> just

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:39.200 
top ten when that happened so it's just

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.569 
top ten when that happened so it's just
circumstances<00:00:40.200> but<00:00:41.040> you<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.340> we<00:00:41.460> had<00:00:41.550> a

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
circumstances but you know we had a

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.510 
circumstances but you know we had a
great<00:00:41.730> year<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.149> is<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.620> year<00:00:43.620> where<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.340> won

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
great year this is a year where we won

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.660 
great year this is a year where we won
the<00:00:44.610> most<00:00:44.789> races<00:00:45.590> that<00:00:46.590> we've<00:00:46.739> ever<00:00:46.950> won<00:00:47.190> we

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
the most races that we've ever won we

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.790 
the most races that we've ever won we
contended<00:00:48.300> like<00:00:48.510> we've<00:00:49.200> never<00:00:49.320> contended

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
contended like we've never contended

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.600 
contended like we've never contended
before<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:52.100> circumstances<00:00:53.100> took<00:00:53.489> us

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
before and just circumstances took us

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.540 
before and just circumstances took us
out<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.570> this<00:00:54.750> last<00:00:54.989> one<00:00:55.199> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.010> didn't

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
out on this last one you know I didn't

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:57.799 
out on this last one you know I didn't
think<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.820> they'd<00:00:56.940> show<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.300> strength<00:00:57.570> this

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
think that they'd show the strength this

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.450 
think that they'd show the strength this
year<00:00:58.079> that<00:00:58.410> what<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.649> had<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.980> years<00:00:59.129> past

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
year that what they had in years past

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:00.889 
year that what they had in years past
and<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.789> opened<00:01:00.120> up<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.239> door<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.480> teams

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and that opened up the door for teams

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.950 
and that opened up the door for teams
like<00:01:01.140> myself<00:01:01.590> and<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:02.760> few<00:01:03.180> other<00:01:03.329> teams<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.840> win

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
like myself and a few other teams to win

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.170 
a lot of races and not only that we
really<00:01:06.960> stepped<00:01:07.229> up<00:01:07.350> our<00:01:07.470> program<00:01:08.030> over<00:01:09.030> these

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
really stepped up our program over these

taper<00:01:47.310> off<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.729> we'd<00:01:47.850> come<00:01:48.000> back<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.420> being<00:01:48.600> a

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659
