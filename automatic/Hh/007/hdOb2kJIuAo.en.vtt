00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
way so when it comes to winter I could

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.559 
way so when it comes to winter I could
just<00:02:13.720> start<00:02:13.959> installing<00:02:14.830> parts<00:02:15.340> get<00:02:16.300> it<00:02:16.420> ready

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
just start installing parts get it ready

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:12.180 
or perhaps I just go and buy a willys
wagon<00:03:07.239> or<00:03:07.840> truck<00:03:08.110> and<00:03:08.380> drop<00:03:08.709> that<00:03:08.890> in<00:03:09.160> I<00:03:11.190> should

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
wagon or truck and drop that in I should

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.130 
wagon or truck and drop that in I should
really<00:03:12.370> put<00:03:12.489> that<00:03:12.610> on<00:03:12.760> a<00:03:12.790> skid<00:03:13.209> let's<00:03:13.870> go<00:03:13.989> get

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
really put that on a skid let's go get

00:03:14.140 --> 00:05:43.659 
really put that on a skid let's go get
the<00:03:14.230> loader

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:43.669 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.279 

so<00:05:44.669> when<00:05:44.789> this<00:05:44.909> would<00:05:45.089> be<00:05:45.209> the<00:05:45.389> four-banger

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:46.289 
so when this would be the four-banger

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:49.339 
so when this would be the four-banger
was<00:05:46.469> gonna<00:05:46.559> put<00:05:46.830> in<00:05:46.949> it<00:05:47.989> just<00:05:48.989> gonna<00:05:49.080> put<00:05:49.259> on

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:49.349 
was gonna put in it just gonna put on

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:51.309 
was gonna put in it just gonna put on
the<00:05:49.469> engine<00:05:49.769> stand<00:05:49.919> so<00:05:50.369> I<00:05:50.399> can<00:05:50.610> paint<00:05:50.879> it<00:05:51.059> and

00:05:51.309 --> 00:05:51.319 
the engine stand so I can paint it and

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:54.769 
the engine stand so I can paint it and
change<00:05:52.319> the<00:05:52.439> rear<00:05:52.919> main<00:05:53.219> seal<00:05:53.509> just<00:05:54.509> because

00:05:54.769 --> 00:05:54.779 
change the rear main seal just because

00:05:54.779 --> 00:06:01.389 
change the rear main seal just because
it's<00:05:54.959> already<00:05:55.139> out<00:05:55.409> and<00:05:55.589> might<00:05:55.830> as<00:05:55.949> well<00:05:56.069> do<00:05:56.279> it

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:01.399 

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:05.149 

it's<00:06:02.399> a<00:06:02.610> Kaiser<00:06:02.999> supersonic<00:06:03.899> vacuum<00:06:04.830> advanced

00:06:05.149 --> 00:06:05.159 
it's a Kaiser supersonic vacuum advanced

00:06:05.159 --> 00:06:08.839 
it's a Kaiser supersonic vacuum advanced
distributor<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.860> you<00:06:08.189> could<00:06:08.369> see<00:06:08.519> the<00:06:08.639> data

00:06:08.839 --> 00:06:08.849 
distributor and you could see the data

00:06:08.849 --> 00:06:11.889 
distributor and you could see the data
tag<00:06:09.179> right<00:06:09.449> there

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:11.899 

00:06:11.899 --> 00:06:16.729 

this<00:06:13.939> engine<00:06:14.939> here<00:06:15.149> was<00:06:15.389> a<00:06:15.419> marine<00:06:15.959> conversion

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:16.739 
this engine here was a marine conversion

00:06:16.739 --> 00:06:20.540 
this engine here was a marine conversion
so<00:06:16.979> I<00:06:17.009> have<00:06:17.279> all<00:06:17.459> the<00:06:17.610> conversion<00:06:18.149> pieces<00:06:19.550> for

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
so I have all the conversion pieces for

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:28.219 
so I have all the conversion pieces for
a<00:06:20.579> boat<00:06:21.439> manifolds<00:06:22.439> all<00:06:22.889> that<00:06:24.289> or<00:06:25.289> I<00:06:26.659> put<00:06:27.659> a<00:06:27.689> v6

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:28.229 
a boat manifolds all that or I put a v6

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.529 
a boat manifolds all that or I put a v6
in<00:06:29.869> the<00:06:30.869> four-cylinder<00:06:31.559> will<00:06:31.709> drop<00:06:31.979> in

00:06:32.529 --> 00:06:32.539 
in the four-cylinder will drop in

00:06:32.539 --> 00:06:34.549 
in the four-cylinder will drop in
because<00:06:33.539> that's<00:06:33.659> what<00:06:33.869> was<00:06:33.989> meant<00:06:34.199> to<00:06:34.259> be<00:06:34.349> in

00:06:34.549 --> 00:06:34.559 
because that's what was meant to be in

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:40.339 
because that's what was meant to be in
there<00:06:35.599> the<00:06:36.599> v6<00:06:37.039> I'm<00:06:38.039> gonna<00:06:38.639> have<00:06:38.849> to<00:06:39.059> put<00:06:39.569> the

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:40.349 
there the v6 I'm gonna have to put the

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:44.119 
there the v6 I'm gonna have to put the
motor<00:06:40.589> mounts<00:06:40.979> off<00:06:41.129> a<00:06:41.159> cj5<00:06:42.709> which<00:06:43.709> I<00:06:43.860> probably

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:44.129 
motor mounts off a cj5 which I probably

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:47.239 
motor mounts off a cj5 which I probably
will<00:06:44.339> have<00:06:44.399> with<00:06:45.149> a<00:06:45.419> Buick<00:06:45.899> two<00:06:46.110> to<00:06:46.259> five<00:06:46.529> odd

00:06:47.239 --> 00:06:47.249 
will have with a Buick two to five odd

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:51.019 
will have with a Buick two to five odd
fire<00:06:47.610> Dauntless<00:06:48.179> engine<00:06:48.629> and<00:06:49.459> I<00:06:50.459> think<00:06:50.819> I'm

00:06:51.019 --> 00:06:51.029 
fire Dauntless engine and I think I'm

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:53.719 
fire Dauntless engine and I think I'm
gonna<00:06:51.149> have<00:06:51.389> to<00:06:51.539> move<00:06:51.749> the<00:06:52.740> transfer<00:06:53.579> case

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:53.729 
gonna have to move the transfer case
