00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
happened oh look at that so this is one

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.840 
happened oh look at that so this is one
of<00:01:26.890> the<00:01:27.010> new<00:01:27.100> things<00:01:27.130> you've<00:01:27.490> done<00:01:27.520> on<00:01:27.760> the

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:27.850 
of the new things you've done on the

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.460 
of the new things you've done on the
maps<00:01:28.060> all<00:01:28.330> of<00:01:28.540> these<00:01:28.690> maps<00:01:28.930> have<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> dynamic

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
maps all of these maps have a dynamic

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.680 
maps all of these maps have a dynamic
element<00:01:30.130> okay<00:01:30.460> so<00:01:30.820> it's<00:01:30.970> going<00:01:31.120> to<00:01:31.240> let<00:01:31.360> you<00:01:31.510> do

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
element okay so it's going to let you do

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.330 
element okay so it's going to let you do
something<00:01:31.990> to<00:01:32.230> change<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.740> flow<00:01:32.890> of<00:01:32.920> the<00:01:33.070> map

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
something to change the flow of the map

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.430 
something to change the flow of the map
a<00:01:33.370> little<00:01:33.670> bit<00:01:33.790> so<00:01:33.910> in<00:01:34.030> this<00:01:34.180> case<00:01:34.420> you<00:01:35.170> shoot

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
a little bit so in this case you shoot

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.110 
a little bit so in this case you shoot
that<00:01:35.470> the<00:01:35.950> waterfall<00:01:36.460> is<00:01:36.580> going<00:01:36.760> to<00:01:36.850> start<00:01:37.030> to

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
that the waterfall is going to start to

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.660 
that the waterfall is going to start to
come<00:01:37.270> over<00:01:37.540> it<00:01:37.690> and<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.320> changes<00:01:38.950> your<00:01:39.160> sight

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
come over it and that changes your sight

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.120 
come over it and that changes your sight
lines<00:01:39.880> right<00:01:40.210> so<00:01:40.360> you<00:01:40.420> could<00:01:40.690> use<00:01:40.810> I<00:01:41.140> do<00:01:41.200> you

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:42.130 
lines right so you could use I do you

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.920 
lines right so you could use I do you
can<00:01:42.250> have<00:01:42.280> someone<00:01:42.580> coming<00:01:42.850> at<00:01:43.090> you<00:01:43.240> and<00:01:43.480> it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
can have someone coming at you and it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:45.510 
can have someone coming at you and it
just<00:01:44.080> changes<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.680> flow<00:01:44.920> a<00:01:44.950> little<00:01:45.130> bit<00:01:45.370> and

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
just changes that flow a little bit and

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.700 
just changes that flow a little bit and
we've<00:01:45.670> got<00:01:45.850> those<00:01:46.060> themes<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:47.260> theme<00:01:47.530> is

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
we've got those themes that theme is

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.440 
we've got those themes that theme is
intact<00:01:48.310> with<00:01:48.520> all<00:01:48.700> of<00:01:48.850> our<00:01:48.940> maps<00:01:49.180> there's

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
intact with all of our maps there's

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.060 
intact with all of our maps there's
going<00:01:49.600> to<00:01:49.660> be<00:01:49.690> something<00:01:50.020> you<00:01:50.560> can<00:01:50.710> do<00:01:50.890> to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
going to be something you can do to

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.590 
going to be something you can do to
change<00:01:51.280> the<00:01:51.520> flow<00:01:51.670> now<00:01:51.850> in<00:01:52.000> this<00:01:52.090> case<00:01:52.330> since

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
change the flow now in this case since

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.530 
change the flow now in this case since
it's<00:01:53.260> a<00:01:53.410> kind<00:01:53.770> of<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.920> symmetrical<00:01:54.490> map<00:01:54.820> does

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
it's a kind of a symmetrical map does

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.670 
it's a kind of a symmetrical map does
the<00:01:55.630> same<00:01:55.780> I<00:01:55.900> can<00:01:56.020> see<00:01:56.140> the<00:01:56.230> red<00:01:56.380> on<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> other

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
the same I can see the red on the other

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.750 
the same I can see the red on the other
side<00:01:56.860> anything<00:01:57.220> happens<00:01:57.490> on<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.640> other

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
side anything happens on the other

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.910 
side anything happens on the other
exactly<00:01:58.330> base<00:01:58.480> yeah<00:01:58.780> yeah<00:01:59.050> so<00:01:59.290> whatever<00:01:59.710> base

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
exactly base yeah yeah so whatever base

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.950 
exactly base yeah yeah so whatever base

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:01.960 
you're in we've got the water theme for

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:03.480 
you're in we've got the water theme for
this<00:02:02.050> one<00:02:02.290> so<00:02:02.320> in<00:02:02.500> this<00:02:02.590> case<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.980> Dennis<00:02:03.280> runs

this one so in this case is Dennis runs

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.790 
this one so in this case is Dennis runs
over<00:02:03.790> flashes<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.450> will<00:02:04.990> see<00:02:05.140> his<00:02:05.350> aims<00:02:05.500> pretty

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:05.800 
over flashes it will see his aims pretty

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:06.560 
over flashes it will see his aims pretty

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
there we go so now will the water keep

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.040 
there we go so now will the water keep
going<00:02:09.520> down<00:02:09.640> through<00:02:09.820> the<00:02:09.910> entire<00:02:10.210> match<00:02:10.690> or

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
going down through the entire match or

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.900 
going down through the entire match or
does<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:11.260> reset<00:02:11.710> will<00:02:11.920> eventually<00:02:12.460> reset<00:02:12.820> I
