from<00:00:24.060> my<00:00:24.650> scar<00:00:25.650> class<00:00:25.980> i<00:00:26.220> had<00:00:26.369> scavenger<00:00:26.939> one

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
from my scar class i had scavenger one

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.120 
from my scar class i had scavenger one
of<00:00:27.539> the<00:00:27.599> assault<00:00:27.900> rifles<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.410> used<00:00:28.590> scavenger

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
of the assault rifles i used scavenger

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.470 
of the assault rifles i used scavenger
so<00:00:29.970> I<00:00:30.000> just<00:00:30.179> now<00:00:30.300> picked<00:00:30.570> up<00:00:30.689> this<00:00:30.840> mp5k

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
so I just now picked up this mp5k

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.610 
so I just now picked up this mp5k
stopping<00:00:33.480> power<00:00:33.630> pro<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.110> steady<00:00:34.380> aim<00:00:34.590> pro

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.370 
stopping power pro and steady aim pro
I'm<00:00:35.579> using<00:00:35.730> a<00:00:35.880> silencer<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.750> it<00:00:36.930> really

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
I'm using a silencer because it really

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.619 
I'm using a silencer because it really
reduces<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.520> recoil<00:00:38.670> on<00:00:39.090> this<00:00:39.239> gun<00:00:39.420> because

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
reduces the recoil on this gun because

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.350 
reduces the recoil on this gun because
that's<00:00:39.840> probably<00:00:40.170> my<00:00:40.500> only<00:00:41.120> complaint<00:00:42.120> on

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
that's probably my only complaint on

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.779 
that's probably my only complaint on
this<00:00:42.570> again<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.800> gun<00:00:45.140> sorry<00:00:46.610> is<00:00:47.610> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
this again is the gun sorry is the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.180 
this again is the gun sorry is the
recoil<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.329> just<00:00:48.510> crazy<00:00:49.379> on<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:49.800> gun<00:00:50.039> without

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
recoil is just crazy on this gun without

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.920 
recoil is just crazy on this gun without
a<00:00:50.370> silenced<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> still<00:00:51.510> has<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> lot<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
a silenced and it still has a lot of

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.740 
a silenced and it still has a lot of
recoil<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.530> a<00:00:52.559> silencer<00:00:53.449> but<00:00:54.449> I'm<00:00:54.539> really

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
recoil with a silencer but I'm really

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.119 
recoil with a silencer but I'm really
starting<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.050> like<00:00:55.170> this<00:00:55.320> gun<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.559> lot<00:00:55.800> it<00:00:55.980> has<00:00:56.070> a

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
game there's my first kill what I always

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.179 
game there's my first kill what I always
do<00:01:05.580> on<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.510> plane<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.110> always<00:01:07.350> plant<00:01:07.799> one<00:01:08.010> in

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
do on the plane is always plant one in

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.980 
do on the plane is always plant one in
that<00:01:08.340> doorway<00:01:08.549> there<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.540> people<00:01:09.900> are

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
that doorway there because people are

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.260 
that doorway there because people are
always<00:01:10.170> trying<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.530> get<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.860> here<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.970> guy<00:01:12.240> I

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.580 
always trying to get in here this guy I

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.220 
him I guess scavenger pro will work out
okay<00:01:25.439> on<00:01:25.710> this<00:01:26.430> class

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
like I said I always plant a claymore up

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.410 
like I said I always plant a claymore up
here<00:01:31.500> right<00:01:32.160> by<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.370> cockpit<00:01:32.940> right<00:01:33.120> before

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
here right by the cockpit right before

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.850 
here right by the cockpit right before
they<00:01:33.510> walk<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.290> usually<00:01:34.440> gets<00:01:34.650> me<00:01:34.770> a

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
they walk in and it usually gets me a

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.300 
they walk in and it usually gets me a
lot<00:01:35.010> of<00:01:35.100> kills<00:01:36.710> and<00:01:37.710> then<00:01:37.830> search<00:01:38.040> is<00:01:38.160> not

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
lot of kills and then search is not

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.000 
lot of kills and then search is not
going<00:01:38.580> for<00:01:38.820> the<00:01:39.170> plane<00:01:40.170> sometimes<00:01:40.830> they're

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.010 
going for the plane sometimes they're

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.790 
going for the plane sometimes they're
not<00:01:41.220> but<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:42.170> know<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.410> usually<00:01:43.770> pretty

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
not but I know that's usually pretty

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.370 
not but I know that's usually pretty
busy<00:01:44.220> air<00:01:44.490> there's<00:01:44.730> a<00:01:44.820> guy<00:01:44.970> back<00:01:45.180> there<00:01:48.230> and<00:01:49.230> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
there probably if I got a little bit

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.840 
there probably if I got a little bit
farther<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:55.020> out<00:01:55.260> have<00:01:55.410> been<00:01:55.530> dead<00:01:55.850> another

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
farther back out have been dead another

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.460 
farther back out have been dead another
guys<00:01:57.090> back<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.390> here<00:01:57.780> I<00:01:57.810> can't<00:01:58.140> even<00:01:58.230> get<00:01:58.440> out

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
guys back in here I can't even get out

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:03.050 
guys back in here I can't even get out
of<00:01:58.590> the<00:01:58.770> airplane<00:01:59.340> yet<00:02:01.550> but<00:02:02.550> this<00:02:02.670> gun<00:02:02.910> the

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
of the airplane yet but this gun the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.330 
of the airplane yet but this gun the
only<00:02:03.240> well<00:02:03.630> besides<00:02:04.020> the<00:02:04.320> recoil<00:02:04.770> and<00:02:05.010> also

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
only well besides the recoil and also

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.150 
only well besides the recoil and also
the<00:02:05.520> magazine<00:02:06.000> isn't<00:02:06.240> very<00:02:06.570> or<00:02:06.810> clip<00:02:07.160> isn't

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
the magazine isn't very or clip isn't

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.280 
the magazine isn't very or clip isn't
very<00:02:08.610> large<00:02:09.210> either<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.780> can<00:02:09.869> actually

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
very large either so you can actually

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.110 
very large either so you can actually
and<00:02:10.800> with<00:02:10.920> the<00:02:11.010> fire<00:02:11.220> rate<00:02:11.490> you<00:02:11.730> go<00:02:11.880> through

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
and with the fire rate you go through

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.840 
and with the fire rate you go through
the<00:02:12.240> clip<00:02:12.480> pretty<00:02:12.720> quick<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.580> I'll<00:02:14.670> get<00:02:14.760> my

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
the clip pretty quick so I'll get my

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.480 
the clip pretty quick so I'll get my
Harrier<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.590> always<00:02:16.590> reload<00:02:16.920> out<00:02:17.070> here<00:02:17.280> too

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
Harrier I always reload out here too

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.420 
Harrier I always reload out here too
when<00:02:17.610> I'm<00:02:17.700> around<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.090> airplane<00:02:19.220> it's<00:02:20.220> just

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
when I'm around the airplane it's just

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:21.650 
when I'm around the airplane it's just
easier<00:02:20.820> because<00:02:20.940> people<00:02:21.300> are<00:02:21.390> always<00:02:21.540> coming

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:21.660 
easier because people are always coming

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.860 
easier because people are always coming
in<00:02:22.110> or<00:02:22.430> spawning<00:02:23.430> in<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.940> shop<00:02:24.330> there<00:02:24.630> and

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
in or spawning in that shop there and

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.990 
in or spawning in that shop there and
going<00:02:25.740> through<00:02:25.890> the<00:02:26.010> airplane<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:26.940> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
going through the airplane so it's a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.710 
going through the airplane so it's a
good<00:02:27.150> spot<00:02:27.420> to<00:02:27.480> reload<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.850> get<00:02:29.850> my<00:02:29.970> pavelow<00:02:30.240> i

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
good spot to reload I get my pavelow i

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:36.190 
good spot to reload I get my pavelow i

you get the pave low going it could be

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
night for me there because i'm using a

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:23.270 
night for me there because i'm using a
tactical<00:03:21.720> set<00:03:21.959> up<00:03:22.080> all<00:03:22.200> the<00:03:22.290> time<00:03:22.500> so<00:03:22.769> knifing

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
tactical set up all the time so knifing

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.119 
tactical set up all the time so knifing
is<00:03:23.459> pretty<00:03:24.150> hard<00:03:24.390> for<00:03:24.599> me<00:03:24.950> it's<00:03:25.950> a<00:03:25.980> lot<00:03:26.099> easier

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
is pretty hard for me it's a lot easier

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:27.860 
is pretty hard for me it's a lot easier
when<00:03:26.489> i<00:03:26.580> use<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.849> default<00:03:27.180> class<00:03:27.420> but<00:03:27.660> i<00:03:27.720> don't
