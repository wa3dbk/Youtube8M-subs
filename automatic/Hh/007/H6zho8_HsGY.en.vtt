00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.830
 Oh 

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:03.830
 e 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.270
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:16.970
 eighth number 10 of games 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.439
 after the psp whose last number we 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.180
 let's go back on three games of his 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:22.640
 direct competitor of the time the 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.170
 nintendo ds because she has nuggets 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.700
 unknown this console and it's even 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.320
 shame not limited to three titles 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.660
 both the console has games that 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.680
 worth to be discovered without 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.989
 more ceremony 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.790
 here are our three games how are 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:35.840
 directly by an atypical game but who 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.780
 has a crazy charm 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:40.820
 she laughs hatsworth the incredible 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.470
 shipping on ds type games 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:43.730
 platform actions are legion and the 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.740
 developers then wondered 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.360
 how to make their title unique here 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.860
 two rather odd choices were made 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.480
 firstly give you control 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.160
 of a little old and secondly 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.810
 integrate a puzzle game inside 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.280
 even of gameplay the player must 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.050
 then switch between the real world where 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.670
 unwinds the flat part and the 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.510
 world of riddles where the 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.040
 puzzle party 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.180
 so obviously the world of 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.680
 platforms is the one that allows for 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.509
 cross the levels and progress 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.400
 in the game the world of riddles must 

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:08.659
 not be taken lightly indeed all 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.710
 those the player needs for 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.180
 progress thereon 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.799
 by bringing together tiles of the same color 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.659
 we can thus recharge the energy of the 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.670
 hero which allows him to use his 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.469
 arms his powers and so on 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.149
 but the interest does not stop there when 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:21.829
 you kill a monster in the real world 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.810
 a special tile appears in the world 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.280
 puzzles if this oil reaches the 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.200
 top of the screen the monster will be 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.520
 back in the flat part the 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.049
 player must therefore take care to 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.310
 get rid of pests once 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:32.420
 for all before being invaded on 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.009
 the main screen 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.119
 besides its hybrid gameplay but filled 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:35.689
 good ideas and working at 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.759
 wonder 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:39.499
 she laughs hatsworth is a very title 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:41.090
 well done the graphics in 2d 

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:42.740
 colorful are leaves are worthy of 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.999
 very good games of the genre and music 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.170
 are not left out and some 

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:46.759
 pieces are beautiful 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.740
 the level design is quite 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.149
 classic but remains effective only the 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.950
 difficulty may put off some 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.630
 players because if the first worlds are 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.069
 pretty easy from the third things 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.539
 get complicated and you have to master 

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:56.990
 both types of gameplay for it 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.700
 go out 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.740
 add to that crazy bumps and a 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.389
 ubiquitous humor and you get a 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.319
 great title that should not be missed 

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.329
 no pretext 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:07.429
 a real pearl that any gaming enthusiast 

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:10.250
 of platform and puzzle game must 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:11.870
 to have in his super jump collection 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.180
 stars is the dream game for any fan of 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.280
 manga shonen sort of skillful mix 

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.050
 between super smash bros and power stone this 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.970
 fighting game offers you to embody 34 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.700
 of the greatest manga heroes 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.400
 from the famous magazine jump sangoku naruto 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.720
 the google ficci if these names are not you 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.520
 unfamiliar forget right away what 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.140
 game is returned on classics from 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.640
 traditional fighting game if by 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.900
 against you know their universe well 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.880
 you will be immersed in a real 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.470
 jumble of super powers and blows 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.880
 of slats in due form because if 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:38.950
 only 34 characters are playable 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.120
 these are in total 160 characters who 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.770
 are present in the cartridge 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.660
 because far from being a simple confrontation 1 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.010
 1 to 1 each fighter has 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.050
 allies he can call for him 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.370
 give bonuses these characters get 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.360
 develops as the 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.400
 player in the scenario mode 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.840
 mainly to use them it takes 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.790
 succeed in placing them on a plateau of 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:55.900
 20 15 each character for longer or 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.760
 less space to the image of a breakage 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.950
 manga a touch on the touch screen 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.209
 then just use them but the 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.800
 gameplay subtleties of the game do not 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.360
 stop there and if the player has 

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.840
 tendency to stuff in his first 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.400
 clashes 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.870
 he will soon learn how to trigger the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.190
 counters and not to sacrifice any of 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.020
 his characters not to be private 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.430
 combined attacks devastating because 

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:14.590
 john superstar that gives pride to 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.060
 fighting says of tag battle what grows 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.230
 the player to attempt combinations of 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.720
 characters to find the team 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.770
 perfect technical nag well done 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.660
 and ultra fun to play 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.220
 in addition to gathering a lot of names from the 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 manga the game of life unfortunately 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 never the day outside of Japan because if 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.440
 the bass and the jam magazine that publishes 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.459
 all the adventures of his heroes the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.840
 exploitation rights are 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:33.820
 unfortunately scattered at 

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.260
 many publishers in the us and europe 

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.180
 a situation that did not stop 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:38.709
 several suites but not necessarily by 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.150
 the same developers the last title 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:42.160

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.600
 enix 

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:57.280
 other creation of tetsuya nomura 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.019
 yet busy on these kingdoms 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.209
 hearts at the time of world ends with you 

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:03.010
 is just the wonder action rpg of the 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.660
 but few people know this 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.680
 title because in addition to being centered on the 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:07.870
 fashion and trendy Tokyo 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.880
 shibuya the game yet arrived at 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.739
 we stayed in English result to 

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.269
 hardly ten thousand sales in europe when 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:15.310
 the other territories revolve around 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.510
 200 or 400 miles but the world ends 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:18.970
 with you it's pretty gameplay first 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.709
 original the player must find buy 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.150
 improved and is equipped with badges that 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.919
 give him powers during the 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.300
 fighting fights that stand out them 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.979
 also by their originality 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:28.930
 indeed the player controls the majority 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:29.380
 of time a duet with commands to 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.580
 achieve 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.350
 with the directional cross for the 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:33.970
 character on the screen from the top to the 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.320
 way of a rhythm game and 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.100
 touch controls for the character 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:37.840
 on the bottom screen 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:39.190
 as much as being honest most of the time 

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.810
 the player will leave the duo character in 

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.250
 automatic mode and will focus on 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.510
 the bottom one in the orders at the 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.550
 stylet are both involved and 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:46.660
 demanding to run every page 2 in 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.970
 a different power will require a 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.220
 different command to be and attract 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.690
 circles of the crosses everything goes but 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.130
 the game is never messy the 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:55.660
 clashes rarely rough and one 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:57.250
 is surprised to chain orders from 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.870
 fluid way for a classified result 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.250
 the screen the badges and equipment of the 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:02.380
 character are therefore subject to fashion 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.910
 in this highly connected neighborhood 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.650

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.600
 have bonuses or penalties for not 

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:09.130
 to be penalized when fighting another 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:11.350
 party special price of the title are these 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.060

 long chapters and revelations 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:41.470
 finals are grandiose 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:42.700
 in addition to the original scenario the game 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.380
 offers a host of challenges and 

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:46.240
 alternative scenarios to discover a 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.680
 time the initial adventurer finish without

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.610
 could not find his audience because of his 

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.710
 lack of translation but who should 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:04.420
 to be discovered at any cost and that's it 

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.800
 it's over for this time the 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.240
 nintendo ds just like the wii has 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:08.440
 helped to deteriorate the image of 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.330
 consoles for gamer in the opinion 

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.280
 public as there are games operator 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:13.780
 pretty bad the minimalist touch screen 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.610
 not to say completely casual who 

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:16.510
 have been developed on it but there are 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.220
 so much game remaining to discover 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.080
 to break that reputation 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.340
 that we will come back with joy on 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.380
 other console games in a 

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:24.760
 other number in the meantime do not hesitate 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.010
 to subscribe to the gameloft channel 

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.930
 and to share this video I tell you to 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.200

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:33.200
