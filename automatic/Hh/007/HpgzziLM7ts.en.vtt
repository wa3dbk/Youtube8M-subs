00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.760

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.670
 the camera removes 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.340

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.340

 do not 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.780
 all 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.270

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:31.959
 good with the left hand only 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.959
 we mark the note 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.280
 good and with music we are going to put 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.560
 remember that this note 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:54.650
 It would be the great sun and this collection here is 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:57.409
 an investment of the minor note not 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:02.819
 that is instead of touching this re here 

00:03:57.409 --> 00:04:06.430
 we passed stella we moved it back 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:09.520
 then it would be the same but it touches me 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:13.150
 We s played here is called investment 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.980
 so then these are the notes 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.440
 I hope you have served them 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:20.239
