00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.499 
didn't realize how high this heel was
when<00:01:29.130> i<00:01:29.159> got<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.520> i<00:01:29.640> think<00:01:29.670> mainly<00:01:30.240> I<00:01:30.390> just

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
when i got it i think mainly I just

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.660 
when i got it i think mainly I just
didn't<00:01:30.960> realize<00:01:30.990> where<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> platform<00:01:32.460> was

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
didn't realize where the platform was

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.580 
didn't realize where the platform was
because<00:01:33.329> this<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.630> probably<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:34.170> highest

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
because this is probably the highest

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
because this is probably the highest
heel<00:01:35.130> that<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.430> have<00:01:35.640> ever<00:01:35.880> ever<00:01:36.540> seen<00:01:37.229> or<00:01:37.560> ever

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
heel that I have ever ever seen or ever

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.499 
heel that I have ever ever seen or ever
owned<00:01:38.009> I<00:01:38.189> don't<00:01:38.340> maybe<00:01:38.880> it<00:01:38.970> doesn't<00:01:39.119> look<00:01:39.299> at

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
owned I don't maybe it doesn't look at

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.630 
owned I don't maybe it doesn't look at
as<00:01:39.600> high<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:40.770> video<00:01:41.070> but<00:01:41.280> this<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.610> a

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
as high in the video but this is a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.280 
as high in the video but this is a
really<00:01:42.000> high<00:01:42.150> heel<00:01:42.390> like<00:01:42.570> it's<00:01:42.750> got<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.049> be<00:01:43.140> at

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
really high heel like it's got to be at

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.440 
really high heel like it's got to be at
least<00:01:43.320> I<00:01:43.829> don't<00:01:44.009> like<00:01:44.610> seven<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.060> eight<00:01:45.210> inches

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
least I don't like seven or eight inches

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.289 
least I don't like seven or eight inches
and<00:01:46.259> there's<00:01:46.590> also<00:01:46.770> like<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.009> platform<00:01:47.670> which

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
and there's also like the platform which

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.109 
and there's also like the platform which
makes<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.600> really<00:01:48.750> high<00:01:48.960> i'm<00:01:49.259> 55<00:01:50.040> myself<00:01:50.700> so<00:01:51.090> i

makes it really high i'm 55 myself so i

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:52.760 
makes it really high i'm 55 myself so i
don't<00:01:51.390> really<00:01:51.600> need<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.200> extra<00:01:52.409> height<00:01:52.560> plus

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
don't really need the extra height plus
