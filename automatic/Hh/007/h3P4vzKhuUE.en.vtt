ring out of six inches of any 20 or 21
gauge<00:00:10.590> wire<00:00:10.830> so<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.820> pre-cut<00:00:12.269> here<00:00:12.809> six

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
gauge wire so I have pre-cut here six

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.919 
gauge wire so I have pre-cut here six
inches<00:00:13.620> of<00:00:13.950> 21<00:00:14.639> gauge<00:00:14.880> silver<00:00:15.509> filled<00:00:15.719> wire

you<00:00:16.529> could<00:00:16.650> use<00:00:16.800> sterling<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.670> if<00:00:17.940> you're

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
you could use sterling and if you're

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.609 
you could use sterling and if you're
careful<00:00:18.270> you<00:00:18.480> can<00:00:18.690> even<00:00:18.810> use<00:00:19.050> silver<00:00:19.410> plate

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
careful you can even use silver plate

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.070 
careful you can even use silver plate
but<00:00:19.859> any<00:00:20.039> copper<00:00:21.029> wire<00:00:21.270> would<00:00:21.630> work<00:00:21.810> really

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
but any copper wire would work really

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.290 
but any copper wire would work really
well<00:00:22.289> for<00:00:22.650> this<00:00:22.769> project<00:00:23.189> as<00:00:23.340> well<00:00:23.369> so<00:00:24.000> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
well for this project as well so the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.300 
well for this project as well so the
first<00:00:24.330> thing<00:00:24.720> that<00:00:24.990> I'm<00:00:25.320> going<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.529> do<00:00:25.710> is<00:00:26.010> take

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
first thing that I'm going to do is take

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.189 
first thing that I'm going to do is take
a<00:00:26.340> round<00:00:26.760> nose<00:00:26.970> pliers<00:00:27.300> and<00:00:27.750> I'm<00:00:27.990> going<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
a round nose pliers and I'm going to

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.979 
a round nose pliers and I'm going to
curl<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.189> edges<00:00:29.369> of<00:00:29.880> my<00:00:31.219> wire<00:00:32.219> over<00:00:32.940> into<00:00:33.660> a

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
curl the edges of my wire over into a

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.410 
curl the edges of my wire over into a
loop<00:00:34.680> you<00:00:35.190> get<00:00:35.340> back<00:00:35.489> and<00:00:35.700> focus<00:00:35.880> here<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.360> you

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
loop you get back and focus here so you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.970 
loop you get back and focus here so you
can<00:00:36.600> see<00:00:37.219> so<00:00:38.219> here<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> have<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.270> loop<00:00:39.739> and<00:00:40.739> I<00:00:40.829> do

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
can see so here I have a loop and I do

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.720 
can see so here I have a loop and I do
the<00:00:41.070> same<00:00:41.309> thing<00:00:41.610> on<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.030> other<00:00:42.059> end<00:00:43.550> curl<00:00:44.550> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
the same thing on the other end curl it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.779 
the same thing on the other end curl it
over<00:00:45.649> into<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.680> loop<00:00:47.250> just<00:00:48.180> like<00:00:48.390> that<00:00:49.160> okay<00:00:50.160> so

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
over into a loop just like that okay so

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.490 
over into a loop just like that okay so
now<00:00:50.940> what<00:00:51.090> I'm<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.360> do<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.780> just<00:00:52.320> create

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
now what I'm going to do is just create

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.100 
now what I'm going to do is just create
any<00:00:52.860> type<00:00:53.070> of<00:00:53.129> squiggle<00:00:53.699> design<00:00:54.059> that<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.600> want

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
any type of squiggle design that I want

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.670 
any type of squiggle design that I want
so<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.239> going<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.449> do<00:00:57.660> is<00:00:57.989> just

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
so I think what I'm going to do is just

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.869 
so I think what I'm going to do is just
kind<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.160> use<00:00:59.399> my<00:00:59.579> pliers<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:01.620> make<00:01:01.649> some<00:01:02.609> cute

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
kind of use my pliers to make some cute

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.440 
kind of use my pliers to make some cute
little<00:01:02.910> designs

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:14.760 

so<00:01:09.090> can<00:01:10.090> see<00:01:11.670> what<00:01:12.670> I'm<00:01:12.820> doing<00:01:13.020> here<00:01:14.020> just<00:01:14.590> a

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
so can see what I'm doing here just a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.719 
so can see what I'm doing here just a
few<00:01:14.979> little<00:01:15.280> squigglies<00:01:16.799> like<00:01:17.799> like<00:01:18.369> I<00:01:18.520> said

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
few little squigglies like like I said

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:22.770 
few little squigglies like like I said
you<00:01:18.850> can<00:01:19.000> do<00:01:19.180> whatever<00:01:19.689> you<00:01:20.259> want<00:01:20.530> so<00:01:21.780> I'll

come back to you whenever I have created

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.950 
come back to you whenever I have created
some<00:01:25.060> squiggles<00:01:25.450> that<00:01:25.630> I<00:01:25.659> like<00:01:27.420> okay<00:01:28.420> I'm<00:01:28.690> back

some squiggles that I like okay I'm back
with<00:01:29.170> a<00:01:29.200> squiggle<00:01:29.530> design<00:01:29.950> that<00:01:30.220> I'm<00:01:30.369> almost

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
with a squiggle design that I'm almost

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.929 
with a squiggle design that I'm almost
done<00:01:31.149> with<00:01:31.210> and<00:01:31.780> I<00:01:32.350> want<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.619> show<00:01:32.770> you<00:01:32.830> an<00:01:33.759> easy

might not be something you like so what

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.630 
might not be something you like so what
I<00:01:40.479> need<00:01:40.869> to<00:01:40.929> do<00:01:41.170> to<00:01:41.500> kind<00:01:41.710> of<00:01:41.800> not<00:01:42.220> have<00:01:42.460> this

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
I need to do to kind of not have this

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.440 
I need to do to kind of not have this
extra<00:01:43.149> long<00:01:43.330> little<00:01:44.159> line<00:01:45.159> downward<00:01:45.819> is<00:01:46.000> I

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
extra long little line downward is I

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.690 
extra long little line downward is I
need<00:01:46.600> to<00:01:46.720> make<00:01:46.869> one<00:01:47.140> more<00:01:47.319> squiggle<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.340> in

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
need to make one more squiggle so in

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.899 
need to make one more squiggle so in
order<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:49.090> do<00:01:49.330> that<00:01:49.569> my<00:01:50.049> loop<00:01:50.799> is<00:01:51.069> turned<00:01:52.000> up

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
order to do that my loop is turned up

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.490 
order to do that my loop is turned up
opposite<00:01:54.909> of<00:01:55.149> the<00:01:55.509> way<00:01:55.659> that<00:01:55.959> the<00:01:56.110> other<00:01:56.229> loop

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
opposite of the way that the other loop

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.669 
opposite of the way that the other loop
is<00:01:56.709> so<00:01:57.190> if<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:58.030> are<00:01:58.509> working<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.259> you<00:01:59.289> notice

00:01:59.669 --> 00:01:59.679 
is so if you are working and you notice

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.380 
is so if you are working and you notice
that<00:01:59.709> that<00:01:59.950> happens<00:02:00.310> to<00:02:00.459> you<00:02:00.549> no<00:02:01.060> big<00:02:01.209> deal

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
that that happens to you no big deal

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.580 
that that happens to you no big deal
we're<00:02:01.539> going<00:02:01.659> to<00:02:01.720> take<00:02:01.929> our<00:02:02.140> chain<00:02:02.380> nose

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
we're going to take our chain nose

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.340 
we're going to take our chain nose
pliers<00:02:02.890> and<00:02:03.280> just<00:02:03.509> twist<00:02:04.509> it<00:02:05.429> outward<00:02:07.350> just

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
pliers and just twist it outward just

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:11.789 
pliers and just twist it outward just
like<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:09.959> so<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:10.989> it<00:02:11.200> matches<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.709> other

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
like this so that it matches the other

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:16.740 
like this so that it matches the other
side<00:02:12.780> so<00:02:13.780> if<00:02:14.200> you<00:02:14.260> see<00:02:14.859> that<00:02:15.250> your<00:02:15.750> little

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:20.799 
squiggle is starting to kind of bow in

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:23.160 
squiggle is starting to kind of bow in
an<00:02:20.980> arc<00:02:21.190> you<00:02:21.489> can<00:02:22.180> just<00:02:22.359> use<00:02:22.510> your<00:02:22.660> fingers<00:02:22.989> to

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
an arc you can just use your fingers to

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.780 
an arc you can just use your fingers to
kind<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.440> press<00:02:23.680> it<00:02:23.709> in<00:02:23.980> or<00:02:24.280> use<00:02:24.430> your<00:02:24.609> pliers

kind of press it in or use your pliers
to<00:02:25.120> adjust<00:02:25.450> anything<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.380> that<00:02:26.560> it's<00:02:26.709> kind<00:02:27.579> of

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
to adjust anything so that it's kind of

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.930 
to adjust anything so that it's kind of
a<00:02:27.820> straight<00:02:28.120> line<00:02:28.320> like<00:02:29.320> this<00:02:29.560> so<00:02:30.459> the<00:02:30.760> next

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
a straight line like this so the next

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.400 
a straight line like this so the next
thing<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.150> I'm<00:02:31.329> going<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:31.480> do<00:02:31.630> is<00:02:31.870> pull<00:02:32.140> over

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
thing that I'm going to do is pull over

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.740 
thing that I'm going to do is pull over
my<00:02:33.070> bench<00:02:33.459> block<00:02:33.670> and<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:34.060> have<00:02:34.239> my<00:02:34.329> bench<00:02:34.540> block

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
my bench block and I have my bench block

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.039 
my bench block and I have my bench block
on<00:02:34.989> a<00:02:35.260> pad<00:02:35.530> and<00:02:35.950> I'm<00:02:36.880> going<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> use<00:02:37.269> a<00:02:37.510> chasing

00:02:38.039 --> 00:02:38.049 
on a pad and I'm going to use a chasing

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.420 
on a pad and I'm going to use a chasing
hammer<00:02:38.730> and<00:02:40.350> my<00:02:41.350> chasing<00:02:41.709> hammer<00:02:41.859> has<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.160> ball

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
hammer and my chasing hammer has a ball

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.160 
hammer and my chasing hammer has a ball
peen<00:02:42.670> side<00:02:43.000> so<00:02:43.480> I'm<00:02:43.540> going<00:02:43.660> to<00:02:43.750> use<00:02:43.840> the<00:02:43.989> ball

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
peen side so I'm going to use the ball

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.949 
peen side so I'm going to use the ball
peen<00:02:44.410> side<00:02:44.709> and<00:02:45.130> I'm<00:02:45.609> going<00:02:45.910> to<00:02:46.209> hammer<00:02:46.600> and

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
peen side and I'm going to hammer and

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:49.470 
peen side and I'm going to hammer and
while<00:02:47.950> I'm<00:02:48.130> hammering<00:02:48.489> the<00:02:48.820> metal<00:02:49.359> is

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
while I'm hammering the metal is

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.180 
while I'm hammering the metal is
hardening<00:02:50.049> so<00:02:50.290> it's<00:02:50.410> not<00:02:50.590> going<00:02:50.739> to<00:02:50.829> be<00:02:50.950> as

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.190 
hardening so it's not going to be as

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.160 
hardening so it's not going to be as
bendable<00:02:51.850> and<00:02:52.060> it's<00:02:52.510> also<00:02:52.690> going<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.989> create

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
bendable and it's also going to create

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:10.370 
bendable and it's also going to create
cute<00:02:53.560> little<00:02:53.709> dimples<00:02:54.190> all<00:02:54.430> over<00:02:54.940> the<00:02:55.269> piece

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.990 

so<00:03:11.380> as<00:03:11.590> you're<00:03:11.800> hammering<00:03:12.160> it<00:03:12.400> might<00:03:12.610> want<00:03:12.940> to

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
so as you're hammering it might want to

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000 
so as you're hammering it might want to
stretch<00:03:13.390> out<00:03:13.750> a<00:03:13.780> little<00:03:14.050> bit<00:03:14.319> that's<00:03:14.560> okay<00:03:14.740> you

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:15.010 
stretch out a little bit that's okay you

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.860 
stretch out a little bit that's okay you
can<00:03:15.250> kind<00:03:15.459> of<00:03:15.520> push<00:03:15.820> it<00:03:15.970> in<00:03:16.120> almost<00:03:16.600> like<00:03:16.750> an

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 
can kind of push it in almost like an

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.860 
can kind of push it in almost like an
accordion<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.560> straighten<00:03:17.920> it<00:03:17.980> out

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.510 

notice<00:03:22.870> how<00:03:22.990> I'm<00:03:23.080> grabbing<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.980> the<00:03:24.130> wire

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:24.520 
notice how I'm grabbing on to the wire

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.540 
notice how I'm grabbing on to the wire
while<00:03:24.820> I'm<00:03:25.000> hammering<00:03:25.750> it<00:03:26.280> that's<00:03:27.280> going<00:03:27.459> to

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:27.550 
while I'm hammering it that's going to

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:29.760 
while I'm hammering it that's going to
prevent<00:03:27.850> it<00:03:28.090> from<00:03:28.120> flying<00:03:28.690> off<00:03:29.020> just<00:03:29.560> make

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
prevent it from flying off just make

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.430 
prevent it from flying off just make

will want to kind of bow up our textured

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.120 
will want to kind of bow up our textured
side<00:04:01.239> is<00:04:01.450> on<00:04:01.600> the<00:04:01.690> inside<00:04:02.140> of<00:04:02.170> the<00:04:02.440> bow<00:04:02.620> so<00:04:02.980> when

side is on the inside of the bow so when

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.100 
side is on the inside of the bow so when
we<00:04:03.280> go<00:04:03.430> to<00:04:03.489> shape<00:04:03.880> it<00:04:04.090> into<00:04:04.239> our<00:04:04.480> ear<00:04:04.630> cuff<00:04:04.900> we

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
we go to shape it into our ear cuff we

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.080 
we go to shape it into our ear cuff we
need<00:04:05.260> to<00:04:05.380> turn<00:04:05.590> it<00:04:05.739> around<00:04:05.829> so<00:04:06.340> you<00:04:06.730> could<00:04:06.970> use

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
need to turn it around so you could use

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.860 
need to turn it around so you could use
a<00:04:07.120> mandrel<00:04:07.660> to<00:04:08.560> shape<00:04:08.829> your<00:04:09.370> ear<00:04:10.180> cuff<00:04:10.420> or<00:04:10.690> MIDI

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
a mandrel to shape your ear cuff or MIDI

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:12.900 
a mandrel to shape your ear cuff or MIDI
ring<00:04:11.110> but<00:04:11.920> what<00:04:12.040> we're<00:04:12.190> going<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.370> do<00:04:12.579> is<00:04:12.730> just

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
ring but what we're going to do is just

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.199 
ring but what we're going to do is just
use<00:04:13.120> the<00:04:13.390> actual<00:04:14.220> handle<00:04:15.220> to<00:04:15.340> our<00:04:15.430> pliers<00:04:15.730> to

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
use the actual handle to our pliers to

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.699 
use the actual handle to our pliers to
get<00:04:16.329> a<00:04:16.390> good<00:04:16.660> shape<00:04:16.900> and<00:04:17.140> then<00:04:17.260> we'll<00:04:17.440> kind<00:04:17.650> of

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
get a good shape and then we'll kind of

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.770 
get a good shape and then we'll kind of
correct<00:04:18.130> it<00:04:18.310> afterwards<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.120> I'm<00:04:19.570> going<00:04:19.720> to

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
correct it afterwards so I'm going to

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:22.620 
correct it afterwards so I'm going to
place<00:04:20.049> that<00:04:20.350> right<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:21.430> the<00:04:22.090> handle<00:04:22.360> of<00:04:22.450> my

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:22.630 
place that right on the handle of my

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.040 
place that right on the handle of my
pliers<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.410> I'm<00:04:23.770> going<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.450> bend<00:04:25.450> it<00:04:25.630> around

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:26.050 
pliers and I'm going to bend it around

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:31.860 
pliers and I'm going to bend it around
with<00:04:26.440> my<00:04:26.919> fingers<00:04:29.970> so<00:04:30.970> you'll<00:04:31.270> probably<00:04:31.479> have

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:31.870 
with my fingers so you'll probably have

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:36.110 
with my fingers so you'll probably have
