first video video tutorial today we're
going<00:00:06.629> to<00:00:06.750> make<00:00:06.839> a<00:00:07.170> space<00:00:07.919> background<00:00:08.639> which

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
going to make a space background which

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
going to make a space background which
means<00:00:09.599> stars<00:00:10.320> lots<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.250> stars<00:00:11.990> so<00:00:13.460> let's<00:00:14.460> erase

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
means stars lots of stars so let's erase

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.769 
means stars lots of stars so let's erase
our<00:00:15.089> default<00:00:15.690> cube<00:00:16.789> then<00:00:17.789> let's<00:00:18.150> go<00:00:18.359> into

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
our default cube then let's go into

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.910 
our default cube then let's go into
let's<00:00:19.680> hit<00:00:19.920> f5<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.970> shading<00:00:21.359> tabs<00:00:21.650> then<00:00:22.650> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
let's hit f5 the shading tabs then the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.839 
let's hit f5 the shading tabs then the
world<00:00:23.130> buttons<00:00:23.930> alright<00:00:25.039> we<00:00:26.039> want<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.640> bring

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
world buttons alright we want to bring

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:28.700 
world buttons alright we want to bring
this<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.599> blue<00:00:27.779> color<00:00:28.050> all<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.380> way<00:00:28.500> down<00:00:28.680> to

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
this this blue color all the way down to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.510 
this this blue color all the way down to
black<00:00:28.980> and<00:00:29.599> we<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.840> turn<00:00:31.080> on<00:00:31.230> stars<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.340> is

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
black and we and turn on stars this is

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.180 
black and we and turn on stars this is
our<00:00:32.700> distance<00:00:33.380> let's<00:00:34.380> try<00:00:34.530> 10<00:00:34.880> and<00:00:35.880> render<00:00:36.660> it

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
our distance let's try 10 and render it

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.209 
our distance let's try 10 and render it
that's<00:00:38.190> pretty<00:00:38.399> good<00:00:38.780> I'm<00:00:39.780> gonna<00:00:39.989> try<00:00:40.440> putting

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
that's pretty good I'm gonna try putting

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.250 
that's pretty good I'm gonna try putting
the<00:00:41.250> star<00:00:41.640> distance<00:00:42.120> up<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.550> 15<00:00:44.550> again

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:45.260 
the star distance up to 15 again

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.779 
the star distance up to 15 again
rendering<00:00:46.260> I<00:00:47.180> like<00:00:48.180> gin<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:49.520> think<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.760> should

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
rendering I like gin I think we should

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.660 
rendering I like gin I think we should
have<00:00:51.149> some<00:00:51.510> more<00:00:51.719> stars<00:00:52.579> all<00:00:53.579> right<00:00:53.789> good<00:00:54.570> now

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
have some more stars all right good now

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.290 
have some more stars all right good now
the<00:00:56.670> color<00:00:57.239> noise<00:00:58.640> randomizes<00:00:59.640> star<00:00:59.940> color

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
the color noise randomizes star color

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
the color noise randomizes star color
according<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:00.989> tooltip<00:01:01.620> that's<00:01:01.920> exactly

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
according to the tooltip that's exactly

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.759 
according to the tooltip that's exactly
what<00:01:02.430> it<00:01:02.550> does<00:01:02.789> it's<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.719> like<00:01:03.960> if<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.589> bring

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
now i'm also going to get this blending

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:34.110 
now i'm also going to get this blending
color<00:02:27.990> from<00:02:28.990> the<00:02:30.900> blue<00:02:32.550> from<00:02:33.550> the<00:02:33.790> blue

background the blue color inside the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.570 
background the blue color inside the
nebula<00:02:37.810> and<00:02:38.760> we're<00:02:39.760> going<00:02:39.910> to<00:02:39.940> hit<00:02:40.180> blend

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
nebula and we're going to hit blend

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.650 
nebula and we're going to hit blend
maybe<00:02:42.580> paper<00:02:43.330> then<00:02:43.959> blend<00:02:44.230> a<00:02:45.360> real<00:02:46.360> implant

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
maybe paper then blend a real implant

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:52.800 
maybe paper then blend a real implant
that's<00:02:46.870> it<00:02:47.550> here<00:02:48.550> no<00:02:49.300> real<00:02:49.510> event<00:02:49.810> ok<00:02:51.570> so<00:02:52.570> as

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
that's it here no real event ok so as

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.150 
that's it here no real event ok so as
you<00:02:52.930> can<00:02:53.020> see<00:02:53.200> i'm<00:02:53.380> kind<00:02:53.680> of<00:02:53.739> thinking<00:02:53.800> this

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
you can see i'm kind of thinking this

rendering<00:03:02.250> know<00:03:03.250> it<00:03:04.030> you<00:03:04.720> can<00:03:04.900> see<00:03:05.110> it's<00:03:05.260> kind

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
rendering know it you can see it's kind

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.490 
rendering know it you can see it's kind
of<00:03:05.890> cloudy<00:03:06.100> but<00:03:06.610> not<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:07.120> great<00:03:07.420> which<00:03:08.320> isn't

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
so there we go hard noise the noise up

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:16.050 
so there we go hard noise the noise up
to<00:04:10.510> 0.5<00:04:11.170> a<00:04:12.300> background<00:04:13.300> image<00:04:14.700> which<00:04:15.700> you<00:04:15.850> pull

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:16.060 
to 0.5 a background image which you pull

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.710 
to 0.5 a background image which you pull
everything<00:04:16.180> from<00:04:16.660> and<00:04:18.420> we<00:04:19.420> put<00:04:19.660> n<00:04:20.370> horizon

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
everything from and we put n horizon
