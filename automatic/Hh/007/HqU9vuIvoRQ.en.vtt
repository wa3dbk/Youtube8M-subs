could get in order to personification to

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.569 
could get in order to personification to
a<00:01:13.810> tattoo<00:01:14.079> design<00:01:14.469> concept<00:01:14.920> where<00:01:15.340> you<00:01:15.369> get

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
a tattoo design concept where you get

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:17.580 
a tattoo design concept where you get
your<00:01:15.700> inspiration<00:01:15.939> from<00:01:16.569> though<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.990> variable

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
your inspiration from though is variable

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.649 
your inspiration from though is variable
in<00:01:17.619> the<00:01:18.009> design<00:01:18.340> equation<00:01:18.939> so<00:01:19.210> what<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:19.420> can

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
in the design equation so what you can

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.359 
in the design equation so what you can
do<00:01:19.869> is<00:01:20.049> create<00:01:20.380> a<00:01:20.409> list<00:01:20.619> of<00:01:20.770> different<00:01:21.100> design

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
do is create a list of different design

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.580 
do is create a list of different design
ideas<00:01:21.399> for<00:01:21.999> that<00:01:22.090> tattoo<00:01:22.359> concept<00:01:22.929> and<00:01:23.109> then

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
ideas for that tattoo concept and then

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.020 
ideas for that tattoo concept and then
as<00:01:23.770> you<00:01:23.889> come<00:01:24.039> up<00:01:24.130> with<00:01:24.159> different<00:01:24.609> ideas<00:01:24.850> you

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
as you come up with different ideas you

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.609 
as you come up with different ideas you
can<00:01:25.149> just<00:01:25.299> gradually<00:01:25.659> add<00:01:25.869> to<00:01:26.020> your<00:01:26.139> list<00:01:26.289> I

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
looking at album covers of CDs I find it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.820 
looking at album covers of CDs I find it
so<00:03:01.120> inspiring<00:03:01.510> album<00:03:02.080> covers<00:03:02.380> can<00:03:02.500> have<00:03:02.680> some

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:02.830 
so inspiring album covers can have some

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.500 
so inspiring album covers can have some
of<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> most<00:03:03.160> beautiful<00:03:03.640> and<00:03:03.880> motive<00:03:04.269> art

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
of the most beautiful and motive art

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.150 
of the most beautiful and motive art
representing<00:03:05.080> their<00:03:05.200> music<00:03:05.500> and<00:03:05.650> I<00:03:05.799> find<00:03:06.069> a

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
representing their music and I find a

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.440 
representing their music and I find a
vast<00:03:06.400> majority<00:03:06.670> of<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.239> really

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
vast majority of it really

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.390 
vast majority of it really
thought-provoking<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:09.010> same<00:03:09.220> could

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
thought-provoking the same could

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.880 
thought-provoking the same could
probably<00:03:09.580> be<00:03:09.880> said<00:03:10.150> about<00:03:10.330> movie<00:03:11.019> and<00:03:11.349> game

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
probably be said about movie and game

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:14.009 
probably be said about movie and game
