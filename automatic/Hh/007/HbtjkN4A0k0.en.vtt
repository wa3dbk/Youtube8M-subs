00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
peripheral player definitely although

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.380 
peripheral player definitely although
he's<00:02:22.100> forty<00:02:22.370> thousand<00:02:22.760> coins<00:02:22.880> which<00:02:23.150> is<00:02:23.209> quite

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
he's forty thousand coins which is quite

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:24.699 
he's forty thousand coins which is quite
a<00:02:23.450> lot<00:02:23.630> at<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.750> moment<00:02:24.140> and<00:02:24.230> probably<00:02:24.380> soon

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:24.709 
a lot at the moment and probably soon

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.949 
a lot at the moment and probably soon
slowly<00:02:25.459> go<00:02:25.700> down<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:26.240> there<00:02:26.390> then<00:02:26.780> you'll<00:02:26.930> be

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 
slowly go down and there then you'll be

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.320 
slowly go down and there then you'll be
worth<00:02:27.200> a<00:02:27.380> lot<00:02:27.530> more<00:02:27.560> but<00:02:28.310> definitely<00:02:29.030> you<00:02:29.209> have

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
worth a lot more but definitely you have

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:30.790 
worth a lot more but definitely you have
the<00:02:29.480> coins<00:02:29.720> and<00:02:29.930> you<00:02:29.990> can<00:02:30.140> slide<00:02:30.350> into<00:02:30.500> BP

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
the coins and you can slide into BP

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.860 
the coins and you can slide into BP
outside<00:02:31.280> or<00:02:31.459> brazilian<00:02:31.910> side<00:02:32.120> then<00:02:32.630> try<00:02:32.840> and

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:32.870 
outside or brazilian side then try and

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.090 
outside or brazilian side then try and
stick<00:02:33.170> him<00:02:33.260> in<00:02:33.350> there<00:02:33.530> as<00:02:33.620> he<00:02:33.709> scores<00:02:33.950> his

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:34.100 
stick him in there as he scores his

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.710 
stick him in there as he scores his
final<00:02:34.459> goal<00:02:34.610> but<00:02:34.790> headed<00:02:35.150> into<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.420> bottom

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
final goal but headed into the bottom

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.590 
final goal but headed into the bottom
corner<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:37.160> from<00:02:37.850> there<00:02:38.090> we're<00:02:38.330> pretty<00:02:38.450> much

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
corner so from there we're pretty much

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.120
