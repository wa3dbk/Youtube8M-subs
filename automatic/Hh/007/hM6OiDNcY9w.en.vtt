00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
learned to fish long before we learned

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.320 
learned to fish long before we learned
farming<00:00:22.619> or<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:23.130> domesticate<00:00:23.699> animals<00:00:23.910> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
farming or to domesticate animals and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.929 
farming or to domesticate animals and
today<00:00:24.720> we<00:00:25.350> eat<00:00:25.560> so<00:00:25.890> much<00:00:26.070> fish<00:00:26.310> that<00:00:26.609> there<00:00:26.789> is

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
today we eat so much fish that there is

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.269 
today we eat so much fish that there is
no<00:00:27.210> way<00:00:27.510> that<00:00:27.539> we<00:00:27.930> can<00:00:28.109> catch<00:00:28.349> all<00:00:28.619> of<00:00:28.680> them<00:00:29.070> and

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
no way that we can catch all of them and

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.310 
no way that we can catch all of them and
keep<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.910> practice<00:00:30.330> both<00:00:30.510> sustainable<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
keep the practice both sustainable and

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
keep the practice both sustainable and
affordable<00:00:31.859> so<00:00:32.340> instead<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.640> catching<00:00:32.969> them

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
affordable so instead of catching them

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.229 
affordable so instead of catching them

they<00:00:57.090> eat<00:00:57.120> smaller<00:00:57.629> fish<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.199> they<00:00:58.320> can't<00:00:58.590> be

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
they eat smaller fish so they can't be

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
can they need to eat other fish in order

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.690 
can they need to eat other fish in order
to<00:01:03.870> survive<00:01:04.170> farmed<00:01:04.799> fish<00:01:05.010> don't<00:01:05.369> get<00:01:05.549> the

to produce fish oil and meal and then

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.020 
to produce fish oil and meal and then
compress<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.680> into<00:01:37.829> pellets<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.790> can<00:01:38.909> be
