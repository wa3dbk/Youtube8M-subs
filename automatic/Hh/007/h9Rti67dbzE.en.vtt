00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
underpowered car race alright

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.330 
underpowered car race alright
underpowered<00:00:37.750> isn't<00:00:38.380> really<00:00:38.560> fair<00:00:38.770> this

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
underpowered isn't really fair this

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.970 
underpowered isn't really fair this
Subaru<00:00:39.700> Impreza<00:00:40.300> isn't<00:00:41.140> underpowered<00:00:41.530> it's

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
Subaru Impreza isn't underpowered it's

just power challenged up here at 6,000
feet<00:00:44.500> of<00:00:44.650> elevation

00:00:59.370 --> 00:00:59.380 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.970 

it<00:01:00.380> has<00:01:00.740> 148<00:01:01.640> horsepower<00:01:01.730> and<00:01:02.330> 145<00:01:03.230> pounds<00:01:03.290> of

it has 148 horsepower and 145 pounds of

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.940 
it has 148 horsepower and 145 pounds of
torque<00:01:04.550> but<00:01:05.320> with<00:01:06.320> the<00:01:06.410> five-speed<00:01:06.920> manual

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:06.950 
torque but with the five-speed manual

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.080 
torque but with the five-speed manual
it's<00:01:07.730> just<00:01:07.910> not<00:01:08.510> enough<00:01:08.690> especially<00:01:09.440> at<00:01:10.090> 6,000

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
it's just not enough especially at 6,000

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:12.940 
it's just not enough especially at 6,000
feet<00:01:11.180> of<00:01:11.300> elevation<00:01:11.390> so<00:01:12.230> I've<00:01:12.350> asked<00:01:12.620> Nathan

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950 
feet of elevation so I've asked Nathan

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.370 
feet of elevation so I've asked Nathan
to<00:01:12.980> bring<00:01:13.310> a<00:01:13.460> car<00:01:13.700> that<00:01:13.940> is<00:01:14.150> equally<00:01:14.720> powered

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
to bring a car that is equally powered

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.160 
to bring a car that is equally powered
challenge<00:01:18.910> it's<00:01:19.910> a<00:01:20.000> great<00:01:20.270> car<00:01:20.510> I'm<00:01:21.110> driving

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
challenge it's a great car I'm driving

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:24.940 
challenge it's a great car I'm driving
the<00:01:21.530> 2012<00:01:22.310> mazda<00:01:22.790> cx-5<00:01:23.480> it<00:01:24.290> has<00:01:24.500> a<00:01:24.530> two<00:01:24.770> liter

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the 2012 mazda cx-5 it has a two liter

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.640 
the 2012 mazda cx-5 it has a two liter
engine<00:01:25.369> with<00:01:25.760> direct<00:01:25.910> injection<00:01:26.210> and<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:27.470> puts

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 
engine with direct injection and it puts

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.160 
engine with direct injection and it puts
out<00:01:27.740> 155<00:01:28.729> horsepower<00:01:28.910> 150<00:01:29.810> pound<00:01:29.990> feet<00:01:30.110> of

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
out 155 horsepower 150 pound feet of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.830 
out 155 horsepower 150 pound feet of
torque<00:01:30.260> pretty<00:01:31.220> good<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.550> guess<00:01:31.660> it<00:01:32.660> has<00:01:32.810> a

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 
torque pretty good I guess it has a

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.710 
torque pretty good I guess it has a
6-speed<00:01:33.410> manual<00:01:33.440> transmission<00:01:34.360> you<00:01:35.360> can't

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
6-speed manual transmission you can't

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:36.940 
6-speed manual transmission you can't
get<00:01:35.990> the<00:01:36.140> six-speed<00:01:36.590> manual<00:01:36.619> transmission

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
get the six-speed manual transmission

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.720 
get the six-speed manual transmission
with<00:01:37.369> all-wheel<00:01:37.700> drive

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:41.730 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:45.140 

to<00:01:42.480> be<00:01:42.600> fair<00:01:42.930> both<00:01:43.410> Subaru<00:01:44.280> and<00:01:44.550> Mazda

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
to be fair both Subaru and Mazda

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:46.940 
to be fair both Subaru and Mazda
designed<00:01:45.480> these<00:01:45.600> cars<00:01:45.960> for<00:01:46.230> a<00:01:46.260> world<00:01:46.560> where

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
designed these cars for a world where

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.770 
designed these cars for a world where
the<00:01:47.160> Chinese<00:01:47.640> are<00:01:47.940> buying<00:01:48.270> cars<00:01:48.600> like

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
the Chinese are buying cars like

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.870 
the Chinese are buying cars like
lollipops<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:50.070> Middle<00:01:50.310> East<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.820> a

more<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:55.950> expensive<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.640> they're<00:01:56.790> based

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
more and more expensive so they're based

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.390 
more and more expensive so they're based
on<00:01:57.540> the<00:01:58.140> economy<00:01:58.440> model<00:01:58.830> not<00:01:59.190> on<00:01:59.310> the

on the economy model not on the

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
manual transmissions should be an

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.770 
manual transmissions should be an
interesting<00:02:14.610> race<00:02:20.270> here's<00:02:21.270> the<00:02:21.390> crazy<00:02:21.600> part

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
interesting race here's the crazy part

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
interesting race here's the crazy part
there<00:02:22.170> are<00:02:22.230> only<00:02:22.290> seventy<00:02:22.890> six<00:02:23.160> dollars

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
there are only seventy six dollars

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:26.540 
there are only seventy six dollars
different<00:02:24.360> and<00:02:25.050> both<00:02:25.320> in<00:02:25.560> the<00:02:25.740> city<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.040> on

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
different and both in the city and on

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.860 
different and both in the city and on
the<00:02:26.700> highway<00:02:26.970> there<00:02:27.120> a<00:02:27.180> couple<00:02:27.510> miles<00:02:27.660> per

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
the highway there a couple miles per

the highway there a couple miles per
gallon<00:02:28.080> within<00:02:28.380> each<00:02:28.500> other<00:02:28.710> and<00:02:28.950> I<00:02:29.280> think<00:02:29.310> in

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
gallon within each other and I think in

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
an ounce know your people actually cross

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.230 
an ounce know your people actually cross
chop<00:02:31.620> these<00:02:31.830> cars<00:02:32.190> but<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:32.730> know<00:02:32.820> what<00:02:32.880> you

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
chop these cars but you know what you

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.970 
chop these cars but you know what you
know<00:02:33.390> all<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.690> facts<00:02:33.930> and<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.470> don't<00:02:34.620> care

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
know all the facts and we don't care

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.040 
know all the facts and we don't care
about<00:02:35.100> any<00:02:35.370> of<00:02:35.490> that<00:02:35.640> we<00:02:35.970> care<00:02:36.240> about<00:02:36.360> is<00:02:36.510> which

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
about any of that we care about is which

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:47.250 
about any of that we care about is which
one's<00:02:37.350> faster<00:02:37.440> so<00:02:38.070> let's<00:02:38.250> find<00:02:38.430> out

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:03:04.620 

you

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.050 

just<00:03:05.380> to<00:03:05.470> remind<00:03:05.560> you<00:03:05.830> people<00:03:06.070> exactly<00:03:06.910> what<00:03:07.030> a

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
just to remind you people exactly what a

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.550 
just to remind you people exactly what a
mash-up<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.600> it's<00:03:07.870> two<00:03:07.990> cars<00:03:08.230> that<00:03:08.380> don't

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:08.560 
mash-up is it's two cars that don't

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.960 
mash-up is it's two cars that don't
really<00:03:08.770> belong<00:03:09.130> with<00:03:09.340> each<00:03:09.370> other<00:03:09.700> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
really belong with each other and
