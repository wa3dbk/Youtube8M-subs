00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
just gonna use the lines for the

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.560 
just gonna use the lines for the
reference<00:00:38.879> when<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> pipe<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.980> grid<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:42.059> first

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
reference when I pipe the grid so first

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.260 
reference when I pipe the grid so first
we<00:00:42.899> have<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.489> flat<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.520> cookie<00:00:44.940> I'm<00:00:45.030> using

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
we have to flat the cookie I'm using

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.350 
we have to flat the cookie I'm using
white<00:00:45.629> royal<00:00:46.079> icing<00:00:46.289> and<00:00:46.920> I'm<00:00:47.640> using<00:00:47.850> this<00:00:48.239> is

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
white royal icing and I'm using this is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.630 
white royal icing and I'm using this is
a<00:00:48.390> 15<00:00:48.840> second<00:00:49.170> consistency<00:00:49.920> and<00:00:50.039> as<00:00:50.219> you<00:00:50.370> see

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
a 15 second consistency and as you see

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.840 
a 15 second consistency and as you see
I'm<00:00:50.910> not<00:00:51.239> piping<00:00:51.920> too<00:00:52.920> close<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.730> edge

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
I'm not piping too close to the edge

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.119 
I'm not piping too close to the edge
because<00:00:54.480> once<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.260> fill<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.590> cookie<00:00:55.949> the

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
because once you fill the cookie the

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.849 
because once you fill the cookie the
royal<00:00:56.850> icing<00:00:57.000> will<00:00:57.390> expand<00:00:57.930> slightly<00:00:58.320> so<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
royal icing will expand slightly so you

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.099 
royal icing will expand slightly so you
don't<00:00:59.129> want<00:00:59.250> to<00:00:59.309> pipe<00:00:59.460> too<00:00:59.760> too<00:00:59.940> close<00:01:00.300> because

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
don't want to pipe too too close because

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.990 
don't want to pipe too too close because
then<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.500> can<00:01:01.620> overflow<00:01:03.470> and<00:01:04.640> if<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.850> are

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
then it can overflow and if you are

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.840 
then it can overflow and if you are

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
directly on a cookie just take a piece

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.850 
directly on a cookie just take a piece
of<00:02:26.270> waxed<00:02:26.600> paper<00:02:26.630> and<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:28.040> a<00:02:28.070> few<00:02:28.370> rounds<00:02:28.610> of

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:40.130 
of waxed paper and do a few rounds of
writing<00:02:30.860> and<00:02:31.040> then<00:02:31.160> go<00:02:31.430> directly<00:02:31.610> on<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> cookie

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.170 

okay<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.190> now<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> have<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:41.790> let<00:02:41.970> the

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
okay and now you have to let the

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.480 
okay and now you have to let the
lettering<00:02:42.750> dry<00:02:43.080> and<00:02:43.500> then<00:02:43.710> we<00:02:43.980> can<00:02:44.190> add<00:02:44.460> a

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:44.490 
lettering dry and then we can add a

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.210 
lettering dry and then we can add a
sugar<00:02:45.030> border<00:02:48.260> and<00:02:49.260> to<00:02:49.710> make<00:02:49.890> the<00:02:50.040> sugar

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
sugar border and to make the sugar

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.080 
sugar border and to make the sugar
border<00:02:50.730> I'm<00:02:51.000> using<00:02:52.580> icing<00:02:53.580> that<00:02:53.610> is<00:02:53.820> little

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
border I'm using icing that is little

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.920 
border I'm using icing that is little
thicker<00:02:54.360> than<00:02:54.510> outline<00:02:55.500> consistency<00:02:56.930> because

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930 
thicker than outline consistency because

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.470 
thicker than outline consistency because
I'm<00:02:58.530> going<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.830> be<00:02:59.070> dipping<00:02:59.310> the<00:02:59.940> whole<00:03:00.120> cookie

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
I'm going to be dipping the whole cookie

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.600 
I'm going to be dipping the whole cookie
in<00:03:00.690> the<00:03:01.200> sanding<00:03:01.620> sugar<00:03:01.650> so<00:03:02.070> I<00:03:02.100> don't<00:03:02.340> want<00:03:02.490> the

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
in the sanding sugar so I don't want the

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.090 
in the sanding sugar so I don't want the
border<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.390> spread<00:03:03.750> spread<00:03:04.470> too<00:03:04.650> much<00:03:04.830> so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:05.100 
border to spread spread too much so

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.380 
border to spread spread too much so
that's<00:03:05.220> why<00:03:05.430> I'm<00:03:05.550> using<00:03:05.670> icing<00:03:06.180> that<00:03:06.300> is

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:06.390 
that's why I'm using icing that is

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:19.980 
that's why I'm using icing that is
little<00:03:06.750> thicker

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:19.990 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.620 

and<00:03:20.080> once<00:03:20.830> you<00:03:21.100> done<00:03:21.340> piping<00:03:21.910> the<00:03:22.060> border<00:03:22.450> then

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
and once you done piping the border then

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:25.470 
and once you done piping the border then
take<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:23.020> cookie<00:03:23.380> and<00:03:23.640> place<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.940> directly

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
take the cookie and place it directly

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.660 
take the cookie and place it directly
into<00:03:25.810> your<00:03:26.080> sanding<00:03:26.710> sugar<00:03:26.740> and<00:03:27.280> then<00:03:27.370> shake

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
into your sanding sugar and then shake

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.650 
into your sanding sugar and then shake
the<00:03:27.700> container<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:29.320> you're<00:03:30.100> done<00:03:30.420> this<00:03:31.420> was<00:03:31.630> a
