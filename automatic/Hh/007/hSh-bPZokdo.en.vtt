00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 a wonderful good day my 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.160
 Ladies and gentlemen welcome again 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.680
 another round of call of duty 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.880
 black ops 2 on comeback we had in 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.460
 The last follow something like one 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.799
 comeback and me many kills very little 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.859
 died but here on the map I see 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.670
 Black for us in the sense that we 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:22.800
 when not so many kills will do 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.359
 because this map is in some places 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.080
 confusing and in some places 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.890
 has a bit of paint going on today 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.360
 For example, this place is for us 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.890
 dangerous from here can now namely 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.250
 everyone can come from here now all of them 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.200
 coming from everywhere is easy 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.079
 and that's just a problem on comeback 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.030
 in the middle is anyway deadline in one 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.640
 Everything is dying, and everyone is dying 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.399
 moves but of course like to try 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:54.899
 always giving our best and we 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
 become and do not want to do so 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.090
 just lose or give up here 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.390
 or so montoya has hers 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.390
 fought 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:09.900
 interesting question or at leicester 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.830
 against popped I'm not the only one 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.820
 against objects I kleingeld felt 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.820
 until now always alone 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:30.650
 Woman we were well spotted there he has 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:31.360
 well spotted 618 no that can 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.570
 not be true 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:38.240
 We can not get it, but I thought 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.110
 already start on it so very briefly 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.110
 to be honest 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:02:00.130
 so once you come to 2 x 2 x yes well 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:06.490
 twice we have that three times yes 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:17.110
 well and then gives the drone the power 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:25.630
 us happy medium is also taboo zone with 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:26.709
 drone the tracks out the hut again 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.190
 is dangerous there you have to actually 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:31.680
 have three eyes on color when you get there 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:41.140
 is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:43.380
 I would have had three out of five um marks 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:45.910
 the advertising 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.400
 three out of five women and nazan eckes 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.140
 expect this woman or not why 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.480
 you have to do that extra extra for you 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.650
 belongs to the three of five points 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.650
 that with something better 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.870
 or cd again but then four of 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:08.140
 five if you count extra or 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:22.270
 not and do not know my ladies and 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:24.960
 Gentlemen it's a mystery so easy 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:24.960
 with a circle 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:32.600
 I did not really care about that 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.600
 at least the drone made it clear 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:44.319
 am already allowed may we wait or 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:47.829
 Wanted on us but were quick 

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:52.750
 since arrived so fast next time of 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:54.750
 turn up I think that will us 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:56.709
 help 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:05.049
 so are the in the hut 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:11.190
 no, there's one more shot up there 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:11.190
 shot and the way I strongly off 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:23.320
 I thought, now comes the other end 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:26.699
 look out there I mean with before 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.610
 announcement before announcement with announcement 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:32.830
 the opponents are here just the wars 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.610
 one over all that is here for me 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.610
 confusing 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:44.810
 and the concentration is I think 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:48.400
 gone again because we too much lahmann 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:48.400
 bullshit lama bullshit 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:55.630
 I can not keep a constant in everyone 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:55.630
 show succession 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:13.220
 that would not be i found a drone o 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:25.640
 we are now visible to those who are 

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:30.020
 I really and so closed the all in 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:38.270
 the answer goes in one direction 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:42.880
 was still far away we are still few 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:46.720
 assistant Dauber still ready what the 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:46.720
 We still need t4 kids 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:57.430
 I fell I said of course meant 3 1 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:58.330
 another but you are my age, the 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:05:59.020
 There's no love for him 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.330
 shot 

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:05.170
 but he is finally beaten 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:07.320
 probably ne yes but becomes the 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:10.690
 finally beaten again 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:13.470
 bullshit well as usual next time 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:13.470
