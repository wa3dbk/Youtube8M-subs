I<00:00:40.740> wasn't<00:00:41.310> happy<00:00:41.760> with<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.910> way<00:00:42.150> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I wasn't happy with the way the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.860 
I wasn't happy with the way the
Volkswagen<00:00:42.930> is<00:00:43.080> running<00:00:43.470> I<00:00:43.590> what<00:00:43.800> sounded

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:44.870 
Volkswagen is running I what sounded

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.820 
Volkswagen is running I what sounded
distended<00:00:45.870> almost<00:00:46.140> like<00:00:46.290> I<00:00:46.320> had<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.560> burnt

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:46.830 
distended almost like I had a burnt

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.740 
distended almost like I had a burnt
valve<00:00:47.100> it<00:00:47.340> sounded<00:00:47.580> like<00:00:47.610> a<00:00:47.700> Chevrolet<00:00:48.240> sounds

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
valve it sounded like a Chevrolet sounds

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.630 
valve it sounded like a Chevrolet sounds
when<00:00:48.960> when<00:00:49.500> they<00:00:49.680> got<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:49.920> burnt<00:00:50.220> valve<00:00:50.460> you

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
when when they got a burnt valve you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.820 
when when they got a burnt valve you
know<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:50.790> had<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.060> book<00:00:51.450> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.110> know<00:00:52.230> it<00:00:52.260> and

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:52.830 
know I had that book kind of know it and

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.070 
know I had that book kind of know it and
in<00:00:53.550> messing<00:00:53.940> around<00:00:54.060> with<00:00:54.300> this<00:00:54.510> there's<00:00:54.990> a

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
in messing around with this there's a

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.580 
in messing around with this there's a
little<00:00:55.910> round<00:00:56.910> gizmos<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:58.110> those<00:00:58.260> into<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
little round gizmos and those into the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:59.900 
little round gizmos and those into the
side<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> carburetor<00:00:59.160> here<00:00:59.610> that<00:00:59.790> was

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
side of the carburetor here that was

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.400 
side of the carburetor here that was
loose<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.450> was<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:00.780> loose<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.020> it<00:01:01.260> was

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
loose it was so loose that it was

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.320 
loose it was so loose that it was
wobbling<00:01:01.800> around<00:01:01.920> and<00:01:02.460> air<00:01:02.760> was<00:01:03.000> able<00:01:03.300> to

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
wobbling around and air was able to

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:04.280 
wobbling around and air was able to
stuff<00:01:03.629> around<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
stuff around it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.350 
stuff around it
so<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.129> eliminated<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.790> problem<00:01:06.150> in<00:01:06.210> fact

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
so that eliminated my problem in fact

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.630 
so that eliminated my problem in fact
when<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.600> put<00:01:06.780> that<00:01:06.900> thing<00:01:06.960> back<00:01:07.170> in<00:01:07.620> there<00:01:07.860> the

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
when I put that thing back in there the

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.810 
when I put that thing back in there the
car<00:01:08.850> runs<00:01:09.120> tremendously<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.740> human<00:01:11.490> than<00:01:11.670> it

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
car runs tremendously more human than it

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.390 
car runs tremendously more human than it
was<00:01:11.970> before<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.660> it<00:01:12.780> doesn't<00:01:13.200> idle<00:01:13.560> which<00:01:14.220> is

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
was before but it doesn't idle which is

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.719 
was before but it doesn't idle which is
kind<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.270> interesting<00:01:17.869> man<00:01:19.009> I'm<00:01:20.009> not<00:01:20.250> thinking

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
kind of interesting man I'm not thinking

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.780 
kind of interesting man I'm not thinking
famous<00:01:21.119> teacher<00:01:21.479> of<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.690> law<00:01:22.369> process<00:01:23.369> of

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
floor over to his house running it all

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.469 
floor over to his house running it all
on<00:01:28.860> my<00:01:29.009> house<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.580> know<00:01:29.700> who<00:01:29.910> knows<00:01:30.090> what<00:01:30.149> has

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
on my house you know who knows what has

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.840 
on my house you know who knows what has
happened<00:01:30.869> but<00:01:31.020> I'm<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.160> gonna<00:01:32.340> rush<00:01:32.580> out<00:01:32.759> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
happened but I'm not gonna rush out and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.340 
happened but I'm not gonna rush out and
buy<00:01:32.910> a<00:01:33.000> new<00:01:33.270> part<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.750> I'm<00:01:33.810> gonna<00:01:34.020> work<00:01:34.170> my<00:01:34.200> way

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
buy a new part so I'm gonna work my way

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.200 
buy a new part so I'm gonna work my way
through<00:01:34.680> this<00:01:34.920> slowly<00:01:35.280> but<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:35.759> thought<00:01:35.970> I'd<00:01:36.090> go

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
through this slowly but I thought I'd go

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.430 
through this slowly but I thought I'd go
ahead<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.420> take<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.660> let's<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.110> hear<00:01:37.170> how<00:01:37.380> it

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
ahead and take it let's just hear how it

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.230 
ahead and take it let's just hear how it
sounds<00:01:37.500> it<00:01:37.890> sounds<00:01:37.920> real<00:01:38.399> good<00:01:38.430> if<00:01:38.880> I<00:01:39.000> have<00:01:39.119> to

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
sounds it sounds real good if I have to

00:01:39.240 --> 00:02:26.000 
sounds it sounds real good if I have to
race<00:01:39.420> back<00:01:39.530> you<00:01:40.530> know

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.380 

what<00:02:27.010> I'd<00:02:27.100> like<00:02:27.220> to<00:02:27.280> do<00:02:27.490> is<00:02:27.640> present<00:02:27.790> diamonds

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
what I'd like to do is present diamonds

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.790 
what I'd like to do is present diamonds
a<00:02:28.540> little<00:02:28.690> bit<00:02:28.780> harder<00:02:29.020> at<00:02:29.200> the<00:02:29.290> time<00:02:29.470> when<00:02:29.740> you

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
a little bit harder at the time when you

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.790 
a little bit harder at the time when you
can't<00:02:30.010> get<00:02:30.190> the<00:02:30.340> idol<00:02:30.720> but<00:02:31.720> timing<00:02:32.500> is

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
can't get the idol but timing is

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.900 
can't get the idol but timing is
affected<00:02:33.340> by<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.550> idle<00:02:34.090> speed<00:02:34.240> because<00:02:35.910> these

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
affected by the idle speed because these

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.390 
affected by the idle speed because these
things<00:02:37.150> have<00:02:37.300> centripetal<00:02:37.900> advances<00:02:38.830> inside

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
things have centripetal advances inside

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.180 
things have centripetal advances inside
here<00:02:39.790> with<00:02:40.600> trains<00:02:41.050> that<00:02:41.410> will<00:02:41.620> you<00:02:42.040> know

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
here with trains that will you know

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.750 
here with trains that will you know
increase<00:02:43.090> and<00:02:43.300> decrease<00:02:43.390> the<00:02:44.130> the<00:02:45.130> timing<00:02:45.610> as

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
increase and decrease the the timing as

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.750 
increase and decrease the the timing as
the<00:02:45.880> engine<00:02:46.210> speeds<00:02:46.540> up<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:46.840> slows<00:02:46.900> them<00:02:47.760> so

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
the engine speeds up and slows them so

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.270 
the engine speeds up and slows them so
I'm<00:02:49.240> gonna<00:02:49.390> get<00:02:49.750> my<00:02:49.780> timing<00:02:50.110> like<00:02:50.680> hook<00:02:51.040> it<00:02:51.160> all

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
I'm gonna get my timing like hook it all

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.780 
I'm gonna get my timing like hook it all
up

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
up

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.230 
up
crank<00:02:52.540> it<00:02:53.220> run<00:02:54.220> back<00:02:54.400> there<00:02:54.550> keep<00:02:54.790> it<00:02:54.970> going

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.240 
crank it run back there keep it going

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.540 
crank it run back there keep it going
and<00:02:55.330> take<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> look<00:02:55.780> at<00:02:55.870> the<00:02:55.960> timing<00:02:56.200> again<00:02:56.620> and

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:57.550 
and take a look at the timing again and

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:59.430 
and take a look at the timing again and
just<00:02:57.940> generally<00:02:58.270> goof<00:02:58.450> around<00:02:58.600> I<00:02:58.990> find<00:02:59.260> it

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
just generally goof around I find it

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.740 
just generally goof around I find it
when<00:03:00.010> I<00:03:00.070> just<00:03:00.370> generally<00:03:00.850> goof<00:03:01.060> around<00:03:01.240> with

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
when I just generally goof around with

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.940 
when I just generally goof around with
an<00:03:02.680> old<00:03:02.830> car<00:03:03.160> an<00:03:03.730> electric<00:03:04.530> stuff<00:03:05.530> like<00:03:05.740> that

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
an old car an electric stuff like that

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.640 
an old car an electric stuff like that
somehow<00:03:06.490> just<00:03:06.760> almost<00:03:07.600> magically<00:03:08.080> figured

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
somehow just almost magically figured

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.440 
somehow just almost magically figured
out<00:03:08.770> the<00:03:08.890> cure<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.790> I<00:03:09.850> can't<00:03:10.090> even<00:03:10.180> tell<00:03:10.360> you

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
out the cure and I can't even tell you

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.130 
out the cure and I can't even tell you
how<00:03:10.570> that<00:03:10.750> works

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:11.140 
how that works

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.710 
how that works
he<00:03:11.890> just<00:03:12.070> does<00:03:12.310> it's<00:03:12.580> almost<00:03:12.820> like<00:03:13.030> if<00:03:13.240> you<00:03:13.390> if

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720

things and feeling things and here yeah

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.700 
things and feeling things and here yeah
yeah<00:04:12.190> accelerator<00:04:13.190> pump<00:04:13.460> on<00:04:13.640> this<00:04:13.730> carburetor

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
yeah accelerator pump on this carburetor

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:19.690 
yeah accelerator pump on this carburetor
is<00:04:15.710> right<00:04:15.980> there<00:04:16.400> I<00:04:17.320> can<00:04:18.320> probably<00:04:18.620> almost<00:04:19.550> put

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
is right there I can probably almost put

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.860 
is right there I can probably almost put
a<00:04:19.760> finger<00:04:19.940> on<00:04:20.090> it<00:04:20.150> from<00:04:20.360> under<00:04:20.540> here<00:04:20.750> it's

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
a finger on it from under here it's

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.200 
a finger on it from under here it's
right<00:04:21.080> there<00:04:21.370> and<00:04:22.370> there's<00:04:22.550> gas<00:04:22.730> dripping<00:04:23.000> out

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
right there and there's gas dripping out

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:26.800 
right there and there's gas dripping out
of<00:04:23.270> it<00:04:23.480> when<00:04:23.630> I<00:04:23.660> when<00:04:24.080> I<00:04:24.200> raced<00:04:24.650> that<00:04:25.090> it<00:04:26.090> you

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
of it when I when I raced that it you

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:30.070 
of it when I when I raced that it you
see<00:04:26.960> that<00:04:27.110> gas<00:04:27.290> trip<00:04:27.910> so<00:04:28.910> basically<00:04:29.480> this<00:04:29.900> has

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080 
see that gas trip so basically this has

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.630 
see that gas trip so basically this has
got<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:30.500> is<00:04:30.620> the<00:04:30.680> hot<00:04:30.830> wire<00:04:31.010> here<00:04:31.370> here's<00:04:31.580> the

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
got this is the hot wire here here's the

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.830 
got this is the hot wire here here's the
hot<00:04:31.820> wire<00:04:32.000> here<00:04:32.330> and<00:04:32.480> there's<00:04:32.600> gasoline

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
hot wire here and there's gasoline

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.120 
hot wire here and there's gasoline
dripping<00:04:33.320> right<00:04:33.560> there<00:04:33.800> out<00:04:33.950> of<00:04:33.980> the

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.130 
dripping right there out of the

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.550 
dripping right there out of the
accelerator<00:04:34.610> pump<00:04:34.850> so<00:04:35.180> I<00:04:35.390> don't<00:04:36.140> think<00:04:36.290> I<00:04:36.350> want

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
accelerator pump so I don't think I want

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.360 
accelerator pump so I don't think I want
on<00:04:36.680> it<00:04:36.710> until<00:04:37.640> I<00:04:37.880> success<00:04:38.660> in<00:04:38.960> fact<00:04:39.320> I<00:04:39.560> think<00:04:40.220> it

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
on it until I success in fact I think it

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.300 
on it until I success in fact I think it
would<00:04:40.460> be<00:04:40.550> an<00:04:40.640> ideal<00:04:41.320> thing<00:04:42.320> to<00:04:42.740> pop<00:04:43.070> that

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:43.310 
would be an ideal thing to pop that

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:46.030 
would be an ideal thing to pop that
carburetor<00:04:43.850> off<00:04:44.240> take<00:04:45.200> it<00:04:45.230> all<00:04:45.470> apart<00:04:45.740> clean

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
it all out put it back together maybe

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.290 
it all out put it back together maybe

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.809 

so<00:05:49.590> there's<00:05:49.800> one<00:05:49.949> more<00:05:50.099> thing<00:05:50.310> I<00:05:50.460> noticed

00:05:50.809 --> 00:05:50.819 
so there's one more thing I noticed

00:05:50.819 --> 00:05:52.700 
so there's one more thing I noticed
remember<00:05:51.180> earlier<00:05:51.569> how<00:05:51.810> that<00:05:52.080> starter<00:05:52.560> was

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:52.710 
remember earlier how that starter was

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.559 
remember earlier how that starter was
barking<00:05:53.129> to<00:05:53.250> sell<00:05:53.460> annoyed<00:05:53.699> one<00:05:53.910> working<00:05:54.300> it's

00:05:54.559 --> 00:05:54.569 
barking to sell annoyed one working it's

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:57.200 
barking to sell annoyed one working it's
working<00:05:54.690> now<00:05:55.169> is<00:05:55.379> that<00:05:55.940> probably<00:05:56.940> the<00:05:57.030> last
