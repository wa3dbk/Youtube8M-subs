00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.899
 themes that android is nesta we are today 

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:07.810
 here in the noisy thirst of the 

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:12.170
 official presentation of huawei on 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:15.530
 Italian market gives rise to shares of 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.480
 1010 tip cases what there will be of 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.380
 right in front of the tablet of the house 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.339
 Chinese that 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.090
 for example many features 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:26.090
 unpublished and absolutely sensational 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.510
 certainly from the adoption of the processor 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.329
 k3 of two in-house production 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.990
 wave 

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:38.450
 and it is a quad core processor 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:41.840
 tells of a real 5g of cards with one 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:43.610
 gpu from as many as 16 cores for which we find ourselves 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.000
 in front of a solution that can 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.510
 compete with 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.850
 integrates treki 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.190
 for we are not in fact we find ourselves of 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.949
 in front of a lady 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.430
 solution that is able to provide one 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:01:00.699
 speed and fluidity really a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.199
 exceptional levels and can also provide us 

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:09.240
 a truly amazing gaming tones 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:12.270
 to show you this we hastily gip 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.610
 installed title that came out from like 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.310
 a tegra presentation title 3 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:19.710
 to demonstrate his abilities and how 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:21.930
 you can see 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.060
 truly presents a graphic 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.340
 excellent 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.090
 plus the framerate is really 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.090
 great 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.030
 We can really say that Huawei has given 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.310
 the best of himself has churned out a 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.600
 exceptional device 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.490
 maybe for the best demonstration 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.490
 change type of whole 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:47.930
 and set up 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.930
 that's enough 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.729
 but you can see 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.729
 there are graphic effects 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.729
 advanced 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.679
 3 

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:05.409
 you can really see how much 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:07.479
 huawei I can say in this field 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.550
 to give me graphic effects but if 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:12.970
 see these water splashes that 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.580
 the trembling earth should be excluded 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.270
 the mediapad 10 manages to manage 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.700
 correctly and without any problems 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.370
 But let's move on to more anti-system like 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.170
 you see we currently have 21 screens that 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.620
 however making the simple i think johnson 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:30.489
 upgradeable 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:30.489
 up to 9 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.890
 back to the commission, unfortunately not 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.890
 we can find the classic menu of 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.180
 android 4.0.4 which is the version 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.109
 installed 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.109
 myspace sandwich 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.249
 and instead the applications come 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:50.520
 show on the whole screen a bit like 

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:52.600
 if it was ios or ipad 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.900
 returning to the hardware features 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:58.240
 let's try a gigabyte of ram we find 16 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.970
 gigabyte of internal expandable memory 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:04.210
 through microsd we lose the usual ones 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:06.110
 bluetooth connectivity wifi gps e 

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.480
 whatever 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:11.280
 that we also find the possibility of 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.900
 connect to 3g networks 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:17.360
 all this is offered at a price 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.360
 of 499 euros on the market 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.019
 I don't know why we're in front of it 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.329
 also with a hand-made aluminum shell 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.760
 block that takes everything the 

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:29.250
 device to an 8 camera 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.040
 megapixel with autofocus and double flash 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.980
 LED capable of recording video in full 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.660
 hd 1080p 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.920
 we open at the top and find the sim slots 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.640
 fights for the micro sd 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.780
 and last but not least 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:51.330
 we also find a keyboard dock 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:53.040
 that it is possible that it is possible 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.480
 attach to 62 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:56.569
 as you can see we find ourselves with one 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.510
 solution that resembles very closely 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:03.030
 those proposed by asus with his 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.890
 transformer tel 

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.890
 internet is really interesting 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.959
 have fun in appearance not least for the 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:12.959
 fact that is able to cure 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.940
 first not really performance level 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.940
 unbelievable 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.889
 we can't wait to try it here 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.110
 in depth and to be able to publish 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:30.400
 a review for the moment that 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:33.819
 we salute from the noisy headquarters of the bri 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.819
