00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
got very red on the cheeks it could be

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.010 
got very red on the cheeks it could be
that<00:02:04.430> you've<00:02:04.640> started<00:02:05.000> to<00:02:05.240> get<00:02:05.390> breakouts<00:02:05.780> on

that you've started to get breakouts on
the<00:02:06.110> cheek<00:02:06.290> area<00:02:06.500> so<00:02:07.280> we'd<00:02:07.430> want<00:02:07.640> to<00:02:07.700> look<00:02:07.760> at

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
the cheek area so we'd want to look at

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.120 
the cheek area so we'd want to look at
why<00:02:08.149> is<00:02:08.209> that<00:02:08.360> happening<00:02:08.690> and<00:02:09.140> with<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.950> face

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
why is that happening and with the face

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.100 
why is that happening and with the face
mapping<00:02:10.640> it<00:02:10.910> not<00:02:11.209> only<00:02:11.510> looks<00:02:11.750> at<00:02:11.959> the

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
mapping it not only looks at the

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.050 
mapping it not only looks at the
physical<00:02:12.560> signs<00:02:12.800> but<00:02:13.250> we<00:02:13.400> also<00:02:13.580> look<00:02:13.910> at<00:02:14.000> it

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
physical signs but we also look at it

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.350 
physical signs but we also look at it
from

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:14.360 
from

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.450 
from
Chinese<00:02:14.750> diagnosis<00:02:15.530> point<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.130> view<00:02:16.310> as<00:02:16.430> well

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:16.460 
Chinese diagnosis point of view as well

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.840 
Chinese diagnosis point of view as well
where<00:02:17.360> we<00:02:17.630> look<00:02:17.870> at<00:02:17.990> the<00:02:18.050> face<00:02:18.350> as<00:02:18.710> a<00:02:19.310> map<00:02:19.580> and<00:02:19.790> a

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
where we look at the face as a map and a

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.210 
where we look at the face as a map and a
mirror<00:02:20.090> to<00:02:20.300> the<00:02:20.330> body<00:02:20.600> so<00:02:21.320> for<00:02:21.500> example<00:02:21.980> the

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
mirror to the body so for example the

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.030 
mirror to the body so for example the
cheeks<00:02:22.610> relate<00:02:23.450> to<00:02:23.600> the<00:02:23.720> lung<00:02:23.900> area<00:02:24.170> so<00:02:24.920> it

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
cheeks relate to the lung area so it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.830 
cheeks relate to the lung area so it
could<00:02:25.220> be<00:02:25.400> if<00:02:25.640> you've<00:02:25.820> had<00:02:26.090> a<00:02:26.120> cold<00:02:26.450> if<00:02:26.720> you've
