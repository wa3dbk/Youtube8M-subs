one so what I'm going to do this drill

00:01:00.549 --> 00:01:02.819 
one so what I'm going to do this drill
is<00:01:00.699> good<00:01:01.449> science<00:01:01.719> Paul<00:01:02.049> here<00:01:02.469> in<00:01:02.679> the

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
is good science Paul here in the

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.170 
is good science Paul here in the
charcoal<00:01:03.309> and<00:01:05.280> if<00:01:06.280> you're<00:01:06.460> gonna<00:01:06.580> drill<00:01:06.909> like

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
charcoal and if you're gonna drill like

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.420 
charcoal and if you're gonna drill like
you<00:01:07.900> could<00:01:08.049> make<00:01:08.200> many<00:01:08.470> many<00:01:08.740> of<00:01:08.920> these<00:01:09.010> at<00:01:09.250> one

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
you could make many many of these at one

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.310 
you could make many many of these at one
time<00:01:09.790> and<00:01:10.420> if<00:01:10.480> you're<00:01:10.570> gonna<00:01:10.690> drill<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:10.990> lot<00:01:11.170> of

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.320 
time and if you're gonna drill a lot of

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.190 
time and if you're gonna drill a lot of
them<00:01:11.410> I'd<00:01:11.620> put<00:01:11.860> on<00:01:11.980> a<00:01:12.010> mask<00:01:12.660> because<00:01:13.660> this<00:01:13.840> you

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
them I'd put on a mask because this you

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.030 
them I'd put on a mask because this you
don't<00:01:14.290> want<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.800> inhale<00:01:15.220> charcoal<00:01:16.890> but<00:01:17.890> I'm

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
don't want to inhale charcoal but I'm

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.440 
don't want to inhale charcoal but I'm
only<00:01:18.160> going<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.580> this<00:01:18.670> for<00:01:18.880> demo<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.330> we're

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
only going to do this for demo so we're

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.220 
only going to do this for demo so we're
going<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.690> make<00:01:19.810> a<00:01:19.870> couple<00:01:20.170> here<00:01:22.080> and<00:01:23.080> I'm<00:01:23.200> just

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:23.230 
going to make a couple here and I'm just

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:24.420 
going to make a couple here and I'm just
trying<00:01:23.590> to<00:01:23.680> make<00:01:23.770> sure<00:01:23.920> they're<00:01:24.100> deep<00:01:24.280> enough

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:24.430 
trying to make sure they're deep enough

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:27.080 
trying to make sure they're deep enough
and<00:01:24.700> around<00:01:25.000> enough<00:01:25.270> at<00:01:25.450> this<00:01:25.600> point<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.170> then

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
and around enough at this point and then

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:34.670 
and around enough at this point and then
put<00:01:28.090> your<00:01:28.210> jump<00:01:28.510> ring<00:01:28.810> into<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:29.650> holes<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
put your jump ring into the holes and

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.920 
put your jump ring into the holes and
then<00:01:35.680> we're<00:01:36.340> going<00:01:37.000> to<00:01:37.030> the<00:01:37.210> soldering<00:01:37.660> room

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
then we're going to the soldering room

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:40.250 
then we're going to the soldering room
and<00:01:38.140> I'll<00:01:38.230> meet<00:01:38.410> you<00:01:38.560> in<00:01:38.650> there<00:01:38.770> in<00:01:38.830> a<00:01:38.980> second<00:01:39.340> I

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:40.260 
and I'll meet you in there in a second I

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.560 
and I'll meet you in there in a second I
were<00:01:41.260> back<00:01:41.500> now<00:01:41.890> we're<00:01:42.070> gonna<00:01:42.190> do<00:01:42.520> melt<00:01:43.420> these

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
were back now we're gonna do melt these

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.200 
were back now we're gonna do melt these
jump<00:01:44.350> rings<00:01:44.590> into<00:01:45.130> these<00:01:45.550> little<00:01:45.880> holes<00:01:46.060> that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
jump rings into these little holes that

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.130 
jump rings into these little holes that
we<00:01:46.330> made<00:01:46.360> in<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.750> charcoal<00:01:47.140> block

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.290 

this<00:01:53.770> time<00:01:54.010> we<00:01:54.190> really<00:01:54.520> do<00:01:54.729> want<00:01:54.940> to<00:01:55.000> overheat

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
this time we really do want to overheat

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.960 
this time we really do want to overheat
it<00:01:55.630> unlike<00:01:55.990> with<00:01:56.260> the<00:01:56.290> annealing<00:01:59.820> things<00:02:00.820> a

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
it unlike with the annealing things a

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.520 
it unlike with the annealing things a
little<00:02:01.210> longer<00:02:01.420> because<00:02:01.720> it's<00:02:02.110> you<00:02:02.320> got<00:02:02.440> to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
little longer because it's you got to

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.830 
little longer because it's you got to
heat<00:02:02.710> up<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.979> charcoal<00:02:03.460> to<00:02:03.490> and<00:02:04.090> melt<00:02:04.690> the

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
heat up the charcoal to and melt the

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.410 
heat up the charcoal to and melt the
silver<00:02:05.430> this<00:02:06.430> way<00:02:06.610> if<00:02:06.729> you're<00:02:06.880> doing<00:02:06.909> a<00:02:07.180> bunch

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:07.420 
silver this way if you're doing a bunch

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.630 
silver this way if you're doing a bunch
of<00:02:07.630> these<00:02:07.690> it's<00:02:08.020> great<00:02:08.350> because<00:02:08.590> this<00:02:09.310> block

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
of these it's great because this block

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:11.990 
of these it's great because this block
it's<00:02:09.880> really<00:02:10.149> hot<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.479> gets<00:02:10.690> a<00:02:10.750> lot<00:02:10.869> quicker

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
it's really hot that gets a lot quicker

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.530 
it's really hot that gets a lot quicker

there we go that one turned around
that's<00:02:18.550> round<00:02:19.230> this<00:02:20.230> one<00:02:20.410> should<00:02:20.590> go<00:02:20.620> a<00:02:20.739> lot

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that's round this one should go a lot

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.750 
that's round this one should go a lot
quicker

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760

drill the hole and do that on a flat
piece<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:42.220> charcoal<00:02:43.220> make<00:02:43.970> sure<00:02:44.319> that<00:02:45.319> you're

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:45.650 
piece of charcoal make sure that you're

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.410 
piece of charcoal make sure that you're
careful<00:02:45.829> about<00:02:46.190> it<00:02:46.459> not<00:02:46.700> rolling<00:02:47.239> and

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
careful about it not rolling and

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.089 
careful about it not rolling and
spinning<00:02:47.540> off<00:02:47.959> while<00:02:48.230> you're<00:02:48.409> working<00:02:48.769> on<00:02:48.890> it

spinning off while you're working on it
but<00:02:49.549> this<00:02:49.730> way<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.450> is<00:02:50.599> a<00:02:50.629> way<00:02:50.810> to<00:02:50.870> do<00:02:51.549> have<00:02:52.549> a

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:52.579 
but this way this is a way to do have a

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:55.539 
but this way this is a way to do have a
jump<00:02:52.930> ring<00:02:53.930> a<00:02:54.109> sphere<00:02:54.409> that<00:02:54.590> turns<00:02:54.859> out<00:02:55.040> round

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:55.549 
jump ring a sphere that turns out round

jump ring a sphere that turns out round
on<00:02:55.790> bottom<00:02:56.329> and<00:02:56.420> top<00:02:57.459> and<00:02:58.459> here's<00:02:58.790> our<00:02:58.940> final

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
on bottom and top and here's our final

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.589 
on bottom and top and here's our final
product<00:02:59.900> perfectly<00:03:00.620> round<00:03:00.859> spheres<00:03:01.599> for

product perfectly round spheres for

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.119 
product perfectly round spheres for
granulation<00:03:03.260> you'd<00:03:03.440> probably<00:03:03.680> want<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:03.980> do

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
granulation you'd probably want to do

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.960 
granulation you'd probably want to do
them<00:03:04.310> smaller<00:03:04.639> but<00:03:05.000> they're<00:03:05.510> perfect<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.670> this

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
them smaller but they're perfect so this

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.240 
them smaller but they're perfect so this
