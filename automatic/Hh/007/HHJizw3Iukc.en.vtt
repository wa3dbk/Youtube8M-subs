00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:05.170
 or the people that I am mega TV today 

00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:09.340
 I bring this gameplay of eight against eight 

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:11.410
 on the map bernard op and you see that I've 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.090
 started a little late in this mode of 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.400
 good game play in this game has 

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.289
 wanted to try the dmr a bit since 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.789
 you know that I use a upload not what 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.710
 I use a lot, a lot more, the 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.449
 carbine and apart I also wanted to try 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.970
 a little the invisibility of the truth 

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:27.579
 that has not helped me much at least in 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.029
 this game I still prefer the shield 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:33.190
 but I've tried it and it's something that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.320
 you stay still, you do not serve 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.300
 nothing because 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.860
 throw a skill to the water and beige a 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.410
 lake that there has been good they wanted 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.600
 talk a little about a new one a good 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:48.200
 Novelty, at least it seems to me 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:50.690
 beginning of halo 4 online with a day 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:54.170
 I was playing so quietly and 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.540
 kuyt that you already know that with a profile of 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.000
 xbox live you can play two people 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.710
 normally to the games because I saw four 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.600
 people from the same been playing or 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.390
 what do you mean, four bets 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.070
 then the name the logo 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.470
 another name the same name with between 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.509
 parentheses 1 and in parentheses 1 2 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.369
 in parentheses then more man 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.990
 because it's the first time you see this that 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.760
 we can play 3 from a friend the 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.430
 console the internet 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:23.120
 I decided to try it with the friends of 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:26.420
 remember that with an xbox live pass with 

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.450
 that comes to you in halo 4 or in any 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.120
 These games come free of all 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.930
 to try a game those do not serve you if 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:38.570
 you want to play with four friends because more 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:41.060
 that I'm going to get caught 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.490
 normal pass and if you want to play with 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.110
 you have someone who comes a lot to play 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.210
 to your equipment so you can play 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.460
 two 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.960
 but the case is that that money my 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.750
 friends and we play a game and if you 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:59.680
 I tell the truth I was very disappointed which 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.380
 with four players up side not what 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.000
 next I was super leaning could not be 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.270
 practically play and given very badly 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.979
 man was not an impossible good either 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.140
 juanchi that you can play against two 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:14.920
 players when he is but he is very 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.300
 Flower difficult way was not 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.709
 the world shooting and there were fields 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.840
 small because maybe I was going a little 

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.730
 better 3 maybe your perfect discipline will 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.440
 can play with two people can you 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.810
 play well with three does not get to test what 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.550
 better is a middle ground and you can 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.709
 play very well and they can go added 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.380
 but is that between four is impossible to 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.940
 least we tested it in a four against 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.830
 four was very bad in an eight against 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.680
 eight nor did you get the field is giant 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:41.080
 all the people are surrounded in the way 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.670
 flower the truth was better I imagine that 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.769
 will be for the fields because everyone 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.770
 does not shoot I do not know why but there 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.690
 minus the machine 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.090
 to more people he will have tried already you will see 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.670
 because I have the good stories about 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.680
 a novelty not even the elbows have 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:58.000
 done this opportunity the first one has 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.530
 been halo that I know at best there 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.810
 another game that allows with a single 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.480
 seduction profile and only one profile or 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.980
 up to four online that's very weird and 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.610
 it's the first territory game I did not hit 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.530
 count until this character is already 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.540
 but what was his name or anything but 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:17.110
 It made a lot of difference to see them or 33 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.460
 when I found out that you could and now 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.920
 I'm very impressed to ask since what 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:23.380
 you prove that maybe I am the best 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.910
 it's my internet that I can not play four 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.280
 at the same time because sp is too much 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.460
 I think it's in itself because I also played 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.080
 talk to the zombies between 4 without 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:35.250
 internet or anything because you already know that 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.250
 It can also be a novelty 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.579
 pretty sin when it starts to 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:43.140
 shoot all at once 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:45.510
 online but yes it is true that 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.060
 wait a lot pulling for enough and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.010
 we shoot all at once and more without 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:53.220
 many zombies and if there's a lot of round is 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.870
 good here and this was the novelty that 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.689
 realize that little left 4 and I have tried 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:00.510
 and the truth, more an experience that 

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:04.140
 let's say perfect but good if you want 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.920
 try it try it you see and I tell you a 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.000
 novelty 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.890
 the first time I see it and you see if 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.510
 you liked the video that you give to the 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:15.540
 there are favorites because they leave with the 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.870
 rest of gameplay that is a very game 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.120
 good 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.889
 thus testing it with the one of m &amp; r and the 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.460
 invisibility has to be a garbage the 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:29.910
 true for this but finally what 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.910
 enjoy 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.160
 5 minutes 

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:42.200
 victory 

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.200
 plus
