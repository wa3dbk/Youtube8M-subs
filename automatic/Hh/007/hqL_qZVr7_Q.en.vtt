let's see open up the couch
oh<00:05:00.000> you're<00:05:01.000> basically<00:05:01.389> invincible<00:05:02.020> until<00:05:02.230> you

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
oh you're basically invincible until you

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.490 
oh you're basically invincible until you
open<00:05:02.620> up<00:05:02.710> the<00:05:03.310> area<00:05:03.700> if<00:05:04.270> you<00:05:04.690> go<00:05:04.870> up<00:05:04.930> into<00:05:05.169> the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:05.500 
open up the area if you go up into the

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:07.530 
open up the area if you go up into the
this<00:05:05.800> area<00:05:06.130> so<00:05:07.030> if<00:05:07.090> you<00:05:07.180> don't<00:05:07.300> feel<00:05:07.450> like

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
this area so if you don't feel like

doing god mode and just do noclip and
then<00:05:09.820> go<00:05:09.970> up<00:05:10.060> into<00:05:10.240> a<00:05:10.360> blocked<00:05:11.260> area<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:13.410> yeah

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:14.970 
then go up into a blocked area and yeah

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:29.959 
then go up into a blocked area and yeah
you're<00:05:15.970> invincible<00:05:19.889> Springfield<00:05:20.889> Oh

00:05:29.959 --> 00:05:29.969 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:34.919 

um<00:05:31.739> yeah<00:05:32.739> so<00:05:33.069> it's<00:05:33.459> glued<00:05:33.759> look<00:05:34.360> around<00:05:34.689> for

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:34.929 
um yeah so it's glued look around for

00:05:34.929 --> 00:05:37.289 
um yeah so it's glued look around for
all<00:05:34.989> the<00:05:35.110> deaf<00:05:35.289> commands<00:05:35.729> I'm<00:05:36.729> pretty<00:05:37.179> sure

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:37.299 
all the deaf commands I'm pretty sure

00:05:37.299 --> 00:05:40.639 
all the deaf commands I'm pretty sure
you<00:05:37.419> da<00:05:37.659> do<00:05:37.989> unlimited<00:05:38.289> parks<00:05:38.829> like<00:05:39.189> you<00:05:39.999> get

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:40.649 
you da do unlimited parks like you get

00:05:40.649 --> 00:05:43.019 
you da do unlimited parks like you get
infinite<00:05:41.649> instant<00:05:42.189> kill<00:05:42.399> or<00:05:42.669> something<00:05:42.909> like

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:43.029 
infinite instant kill or something like

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:46.219 
infinite instant kill or something like
that

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:49.100 

so<00:05:47.229> this<00:05:47.409> basically<00:05:47.769> only<00:05:48.219> works<00:05:48.549> for<00:05:48.819> the

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:49.110 
so this basically only works for the

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:54.329 
so this basically only works for the
unpatched<00:05:50.110> version<00:05:50.409> of<00:05:50.679> cod<00:05:51.119> 5<00:05:52.860> cut<00:05:53.860> 4<00:05:54.099> works

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
unpatched version of cod 5 cut 4 works

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:56.669 
unpatched version of cod 5 cut 4 works
too<00:05:54.579> but<00:05:54.909> um<00:05:55.089> there's<00:05:55.659> no<00:05:55.779> nazi<00:05:56.139> zombies<00:05:56.529> or

00:05:56.669 --> 00:05:56.679 
too but um there's no nazi zombies or

00:05:56.679 --> 00:05:58.169 
too but um there's no nazi zombies or
anything<00:05:56.860> it<00:05:57.519> only<00:05:57.669> worked<00:05:57.969> for<00:05:58.149> a

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:58.179 
anything it only worked for a

00:05:58.179 --> 00:06:02.279 
anything it only worked for a
single-player<00:05:59.159> campaign<00:06:00.809> which<00:06:01.809> still<00:06:02.199> is

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:02.289 
single-player campaign which still is

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:03.619 
single-player campaign which still is
kinda<00:06:02.559> cool

00:06:03.619 --> 00:06:03.629 
kinda cool

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:08.089 
kinda cool
cod<00:06:04.629> 4<00:06:04.929> just<00:06:05.139> got<00:06:05.289> patched<00:06:05.559> by<00:06:05.860> the<00:06:05.919> way

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
cod 4 just got patched by the way

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:35.589 
cod 4 just got patched by the way
unfortunately<00:06:09.099> for<00:06:09.519> some<00:06:09.729> people

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:39.100 

so<00:06:36.229> to<00:06:37.069> set<00:06:37.279> commands<00:06:37.639> you<00:06:37.849> have<00:06:37.969> to<00:06:38.119> bind<00:06:38.899> it

00:06:39.100 --> 00:06:39.110 
so to set commands you have to bind it

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.010 
so to set commands you have to bind it
to<00:06:39.259> a<00:06:39.289> button<00:06:39.969> for<00:06:40.969> example<00:06:41.059> I<00:06:41.479> have<00:06:41.719> all<00:06:41.990> my

00:06:42.010 --> 00:06:42.020 
to a button for example I have all my

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:44.559 
to a button for example I have all my
commands<00:06:42.499> bound<00:06:43.099> to<00:06:43.339> this<00:06:43.520> the<00:06:44.089> up<00:06:44.300> button

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
commands bound to this the up button

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:48.699 
commands bound to this the up button
turns<00:06:44.899> God<00:06:45.110> mode<00:06:45.409> on<00:06:45.619> and<00:06:45.919> off<00:06:46.490> and<00:06:47.559> the<00:06:48.559> down
