hey<00:00:06.450> everybody<00:00:06.870> it's<00:00:07.049> Jason<00:00:07.440> blaha<00:00:07.710> here<00:00:08.099> and

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
hey everybody it's Jason blaha here and

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.100 
hey everybody it's Jason blaha here and
so<00:00:08.550> today<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.179> thought<00:00:09.300> I<00:00:09.480> would<00:00:09.630> show<00:00:09.780> you<00:00:09.809> guys

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
so today I thought I would show you guys

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.720 
so today I thought I would show you guys
how<00:00:10.260> to<00:00:10.290> do<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.620> incline<00:00:10.950> curl<00:00:11.309> which<00:00:11.550> is

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
how to do the incline curl which is

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.330 
how to do the incline curl which is
currently<00:00:12.120> my<00:00:12.300> go-to<00:00:12.480> bicep<00:00:13.019> movement<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.650> I

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
currently my go-to bicep movement and I

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.220 
currently my go-to bicep movement and I
like<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> inclined<00:00:15.030> curl<00:00:15.299> because<00:00:15.570> it<00:00:15.690> puts<00:00:15.960> a

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
like the inclined curl because it puts a

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.680 
like the inclined curl because it puts a
stretch<00:00:16.770> reflex<00:00:17.190> or<00:00:17.340> a<00:00:17.400> mitotic<00:00:17.850> reflex<00:00:18.359> upon

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
stretch reflex or a mitotic reflex upon

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.920 
stretch reflex or a mitotic reflex upon
the<00:00:18.930> bicep<00:00:19.529> very<00:00:19.710> very<00:00:19.920> effectively<00:00:20.430> and<00:00:20.930> it's

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
the bicep very very effectively and it's

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.259 
the bicep very very effectively and it's
one<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.080> the<00:00:22.230> few<00:00:22.410> lifts<00:00:22.680> that<00:00:22.769> can<00:00:22.890> do<00:00:23.039> that

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.269 
one of the few lifts that can do that

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
one of the few lifts that can do that
and<00:00:24.269> it<00:00:24.420> was<00:00:24.539> historically<00:00:25.050> very<00:00:25.859> very

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
and it was historically very very

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.560 
and it was historically very very
popular<00:00:26.580> and<00:00:26.670> lift<00:00:26.849> among<00:00:27.150> some<00:00:27.390> of<00:00:27.480> the

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
popular and lift among some of the

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.269 
popular and lift among some of the
bodybuilders<00:00:28.140> with<00:00:28.289> better<00:00:28.470> arms<00:00:28.890> back<00:00:29.099> than

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
bodybuilders with better arms back than

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.160 
bodybuilders with better arms back than
say<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.640> 50s<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.090> 60s<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.570> things<00:00:30.810> before

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
say the 50s and 60s and things before

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.310 
say the 50s and 60s and things before
the<00:00:31.289> drug<00:00:31.470> use<00:00:31.650> really<00:00:31.980> really<00:00:32.340> got<00:00:32.460> serious

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:33.320 
the drug use really really got serious

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.950 
the drug use really really got serious
now<00:00:34.320> needless<00:00:34.559> to<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:34.829> I've<00:00:35.040> got<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.250> makeshift

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
now needless to say I've got a makeshift

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.479 
now needless to say I've got a makeshift
incline<00:00:36.960> invention<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.739> just<00:00:37.950> stack<00:00:38.219> it<00:00:38.250> up

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
incline invention and I just stack it up

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.310 
incline invention and I just stack it up
on<00:00:38.670> my<00:00:38.879> flat<00:00:39.210> bench<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.540> top<00:00:39.629> of<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.840> boxes<00:00:40.200> out

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
on my flat bench on top of the boxes out

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:41.720 
on my flat bench on top of the boxes out
on<00:00:40.500> an<00:00:40.620> incline<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.160> gives<00:00:41.280> me<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.460> very

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
on an incline and it gives me a very

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.690 
on an incline and it gives me a very
very<00:00:42.500> deep<00:00:43.500> incline<00:00:44.040> which<00:00:44.280> means<00:00:44.460> I<00:00:44.520> have<00:00:44.610> to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
very deep incline which means I have to

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.920 
very deep incline which means I have to
use<00:00:44.789> a<00:00:44.850> lot<00:00:45.030> less<00:00:45.210> weight<00:00:45.420> but<00:00:45.629> that's<00:00:45.750> good

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
use a lot less weight but that's good

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.180 
use a lot less weight but that's good
because<00:00:46.050> if<00:00:46.289> it's<00:00:46.469> more<00:00:46.530> stretch<00:00:46.920> on<00:00:47.100> the

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
because if it's more stretch on the

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.700 
because if it's more stretch on the
bicep<00:00:47.750> so<00:00:48.750> let<00:00:48.899> me<00:00:48.989> demonstrate<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.469> to<00:00:49.559> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
bicep so let me demonstrate it to you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470 
bicep so let me demonstrate it to you
guys<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.280> front<00:00:50.670> and<00:00:51.090> give<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.329> guys

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
guys from the front and give you guys

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.700 
guys from the front and give you guys
just<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.750> basics<00:00:52.140> of<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.289> movement<00:00:52.649> that

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
just the basics of the movement that

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.740 
just the basics of the movement that
I'll<00:00:52.829> do<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> side<00:00:53.250> view<00:00:56.390> one<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.420> the<00:00:57.510> things

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
I'll do a side view one of the things

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.029 
I'll do a side view one of the things
you<00:00:57.870> guys<00:00:58.020> are<00:00:58.109> going<00:00:58.289> to<00:00:58.350> notice<00:00:58.710> when<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:58.890> do

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
you guys are going to notice when I do

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
you guys are going to notice when I do
this<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.640> that<00:01:00.000> I<00:01:00.030> don't<00:01:00.210> pause<00:01:00.570> at<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.930> bottom

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
this is that I don't pause at the bottom

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.540 
this is that I don't pause at the bottom
because<00:01:01.379> if<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.590> pause<00:01:01.890> you<00:01:02.250> lose<00:01:02.399> the

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
because if you pause you lose the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.799 
because if you pause you lose the
stretch<00:01:02.789> reflex<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:03.270> lot<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.510> guys<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.629> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
stretch reflex a lot of guys like to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.770 
stretch reflex a lot of guys like to
alternate<00:01:04.320> these<00:01:05.180> better<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.360> doing<00:01:06.689> a

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
alternate these better all doing a

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.690 
alternate these better all doing a
standing<00:01:07.290> movement<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:08.159> where<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.549> just

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
standing movement to where you can just

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.030 
standing movement to where you can just
use<00:01:08.850> more<00:01:09.119> weight<00:01:09.390> because<00:01:10.290> you're<00:01:10.590> losing<00:01:10.920> a

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
use more weight because you're losing a

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.010 
use more weight because you're losing a
stretch<00:01:11.280> reflex<00:01:11.700> if<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.939> do<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:12.810> again

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
stretch reflex if you do that so again

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.780 
stretch reflex if you do that so again
I'll<00:01:13.260> demonstrate<00:01:13.439> from<00:01:13.799> the<00:01:13.979> front<00:01:14.220> view<00:01:14.490> and

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.100 

you'll<00:01:17.790> notice<00:01:18.000> where<00:01:18.270> I<00:01:18.330> grip<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.720> dumbbells

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
you'll notice where I grip the dumbbells

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.990 
you'll notice where I grip the dumbbells
you'll<00:01:19.650> notice<00:01:19.950> I<00:01:20.040> have<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.220> set<00:01:20.580> all<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.880> way

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
you'll notice I have it set all the way

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.370 
you'll notice I have it set all the way
with<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.360> thumb<00:01:21.570> against<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> side<00:01:22.170> and

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
with my thumb against the side and

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.219 
with my thumb against the side and
that's<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.710> put<00:01:23.210> more<00:01:24.210> tension<00:01:24.509> supination

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
that's to put more tension supination

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.070 
that's to put more tension supination
tension<00:01:25.890> on<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.189> bicep<00:01:26.369> because<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.180> forces

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
tension on the bicep because it forces

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.780 
tension on the bicep because it forces
the<00:01:28.229> bicep<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.740> actually<00:01:29.040> super<00:01:29.340> then<00:01:29.490> even

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the bicep to actually super then even

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.130 
the bicep to actually super then even
without<00:01:29.939> doing<00:01:30.060> supination<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.049> pronation

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
without doing supination and pronation

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.649 
without doing supination and pronation
of<00:01:31.590> the<00:01:31.650> wrist<00:01:32.119> because<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:33.299> offset

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
of the wrist because of the offset

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.780 
of the wrist because of the offset
weight<00:01:33.900> I<00:01:34.110> always<00:01:34.590> start<00:01:34.860> at<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.130> top<00:01:35.369> so<00:01:35.640> that

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
weight I always start at the top so that

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.319 
weight I always start at the top so that
I<00:01:35.850> can<00:01:36.000> get<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.210> stretch<00:01:36.479> reflex<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.110> go<00:01:37.320> down

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
I can get the stretch reflex you go down

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.539 
I can get the stretch reflex you go down
go<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.920> down<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.310> up<00:01:43.310> it's<00:01:44.310> pretty

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
go up down and up it's pretty

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:45.830 
go up down and up it's pretty
straightforward<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.540> I'll<00:01:45.659> demonstrate

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
straightforward and I'll demonstrate

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.270 
straightforward and I'll demonstrate
this<00:01:46.229> from<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.500> side<00:01:46.710> and<00:01:46.920> let's<00:01:47.130> show<00:01:47.220> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
this from the side and let's show you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.740 
this from the side and let's show you
guys<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.520> couple<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.850> other<00:01:48.030> tips<00:01:48.329> I'll<00:01:48.509> not<00:01:48.630> do

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
guys a couple of other tips I'll not do

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.080 
guys a couple of other tips I'll not do
that

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.980 

now<00:01:54.090> a<00:01:54.120> couple<00:01:54.300> things<00:01:54.480> you<00:01:54.600> guys<00:01:54.780> might

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
now a couple things you guys might

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.330 
now a couple things you guys might
notice<00:01:55.260> when<00:01:55.380> I<00:01:55.410> do<00:01:55.530> these<00:01:55.770> you'll<00:01:55.980> notice<00:01:56.220> I

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
notice when I do these you'll notice I

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.430 
notice when I do these you'll notice I
don't<00:01:56.520> come<00:01:56.730> up<00:01:56.880> really<00:01:57.240> high<00:01:57.630> on<00:01:57.930> any<00:01:58.110> sort<00:01:58.380> of

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:58.440 
don't come up really high on any sort of

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:59.870 
don't come up really high on any sort of
curl<00:01:58.620> like<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.860> lot<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.130> guys<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.580> and<00:01:59.760> that's

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
curl like a lot of guys do and that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.170 
curl like a lot of guys do and that's
because<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.830> am<00:02:01.830> NOT<00:02:02.280> genetically<00:02:02.820> blessed<00:02:03.060> in

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
because I am NOT genetically blessed in

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:04.340 
because I am NOT genetically blessed in
the<00:02:03.270> bicep<00:02:03.570> department

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
the bicep department

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.650 
the bicep department
I<00:02:04.380> have<00:02:04.800> bottom<00:02:05.340> tier<00:02:05.700> bicep<00:02:06.090> genetics<00:02:06.510> and<00:02:06.600> I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:06.660 
I have bottom tier bicep genetics and I

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:08.210 
I have bottom tier bicep genetics and I
just<00:02:06.870> can't<00:02:07.080> get<00:02:07.200> away<00:02:07.320> with<00:02:07.650> stuff<00:02:07.800> like<00:02:08.009> that

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
just can't get away with stuff like that

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.669 
just can't get away with stuff like that
it<00:02:08.580> reduces<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.929> amount<00:02:10.020> of<00:02:10.200> tension<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
it reduces the amount of tension on the

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.800 
it reduces the amount of tension on the
bicep<00:02:10.920> and<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:12.090> I'm<00:02:12.150> going<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.450> really

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:12.810 
bicep and so I'm going to have really

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:14.420 
bicep and so I'm going to have really
good<00:02:12.930> arm<00:02:13.140> genetics<00:02:13.560> and<00:02:13.740> get<00:02:13.830> amazing<00:02:14.070> arms

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
good arm genetics and get amazing arms

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.100 
good arm genetics and get amazing arms
doing<00:02:14.610> that<00:02:14.880> for<00:02:15.120> me<00:02:15.270> if<00:02:15.420> I<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.600> much<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.080> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
doing that for me if I do much of that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.990 
doing that for me if I do much of that
my<00:02:16.860> biceps<00:02:17.280> don't<00:02:17.460> grow<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.760> they<00:02:17.820> even

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
my biceps don't grow and they even

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.870 
my biceps don't grow and they even
regress<00:02:18.420> sometimes<00:02:19.280> so<00:02:20.280> it's<00:02:20.430> just<00:02:20.580> not<00:02:20.730> an

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
regress sometimes so it's just not an

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.910 
regress sometimes so it's just not an
option<00:02:21.270> for<00:02:21.300> me<00:02:21.570> and<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:22.530> other<00:02:22.650> thing<00:02:22.800> you'll

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
option for me and the other thing you'll

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.040 
option for me and the other thing you'll
notice<00:02:23.100> is<00:02:23.220> that<00:02:23.280> I<00:02:23.400> let<00:02:23.670> my<00:02:23.910> wrist<00:02:24.330> trail

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
notice is that I let my wrist trail

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.620 
notice is that I let my wrist trail
behind<00:02:25.320> I<00:02:25.709> don't<00:02:25.890> ever<00:02:26.010> do<00:02:26.250> this<00:02:26.520> I<00:02:26.790> let<00:02:27.510> the

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
behind I don't ever do this I let the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.880 
behind I don't ever do this I let the
wrist<00:02:27.810> trail<00:02:28.050> behind<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.470> little<00:02:28.560> bit<00:02:28.770> you

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
wrist trail behind a little bit you

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.320 
wrist trail behind a little bit you
don't<00:02:29.070> remove<00:02:29.250> some<00:02:29.430> of<00:02:29.520> the<00:02:29.610> forearm<00:02:29.940> flexure

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
don't remove some of the forearm flexure

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.760 
don't remove some of the forearm flexure
from<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.540> movement<00:02:30.720> to<00:02:30.990> allow<00:02:31.170> the<00:02:31.230> bicep<00:02:31.650> to

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
from the movement to allow the bicep to

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.250 
from the movement to allow the bicep to
do<00:02:31.860> most<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.220> the<00:02:32.310> work<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:32.840> again<00:02:33.840> a<00:02:33.990> little

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
do most of the work and again a little

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:35.360 
do most of the work and again a little
trick<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.500> if<00:02:34.709> you're<00:02:34.830> like<00:02:34.920> me<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:35.250> you're

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
trick that if you're like me and you're

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.220 
trick that if you're like me and you're
not<00:02:35.550> genetically<00:02:36.270> blessed<00:02:36.630> in<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.870> bicep

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
not genetically blessed in the bicep

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.350 
not genetically blessed in the bicep
department<00:02:37.770> you<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.610> to<00:02:38.730> take<00:02:38.880> advantage<00:02:39.240> of

lagging muscle like that now I'll go

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.490 
lagging muscle like that now I'll go
ahead<00:02:45.330> and<00:02:45.510> do<00:02:45.570> a<00:02:45.600> full<00:02:45.810> work<00:02:46.020> set<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.410> you

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
use a stretch reflex hard out of the

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.840 
use a stretch reflex hard out of the
bottom

alright<00:03:27.050> guys<00:03:27.170> that's<00:03:27.440> the<00:03:27.560> basic<00:03:27.950> incline

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
alright guys that's the basic incline

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.950 
alright guys that's the basic incline
curl<00:03:28.610> and<00:03:28.790> I'm<00:03:28.910> going<00:03:29.060> to<00:03:29.150> do<00:03:29.240> another<00:03:29.720> set

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:29.960 
curl and I'm going to do another set

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.300 
curl and I'm going to do another set
after<00:03:30.200> that<00:03:30.320> I<00:03:30.350> usually<00:03:30.680> do<00:03:30.920> two<00:03:31.160> to<00:03:31.280> three

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
after that I usually do two to three

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.400 
after that I usually do two to three
sets<00:03:31.490> of<00:03:31.760> those<00:03:31.910> every<00:03:32.180> workout<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:32.900> again

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
sets of those every workout and again

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.050 
sets of those every workout and again
you'll<00:03:33.560> notice<00:03:33.770> I<00:03:33.980> did<00:03:34.400> do<00:03:34.550> higher<00:03:34.730> reps

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
you'll notice I did do higher reps

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.160 
you'll notice I did do higher reps
something<00:03:35.360> I<00:03:35.420> need<00:03:35.570> to<00:03:35.630> go<00:03:35.720> ahead<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:35.990> start

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
something I need to go ahead and start

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:37.210 
something I need to go ahead and start
increasing<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.710> weight<00:03:36.860> now<00:03:36.980> that<00:03:37.130> I'm

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
increasing the weight now that I'm

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.750 
increasing the weight now that I'm
hitting<00:03:37.340> twelve<00:03:37.700> on<00:03:37.880> those<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:40.160> even<00:03:40.640> then

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
hitting twelve on those but even then

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.610 
hitting twelve on those but even then
that<00:03:40.910> that<00:03:41.240> weight<00:03:41.450> feels<00:03:41.750> fairly<00:03:42.170> heavy<00:03:42.380> for

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
that that weight feels fairly heavy for

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.350 
that that weight feels fairly heavy for
me<00:03:42.710> because<00:03:43.070> I<00:03:43.280> did<00:03:43.610> deadlifts<00:03:44.210> and

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.360 
me because I did deadlifts and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:46.870 
me because I did deadlifts and
particularly<00:03:45.130> weighted<00:03:46.130> pull-ups<00:03:46.400> before<00:03:46.640> I

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
particularly weighted pull-ups before I

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.690
