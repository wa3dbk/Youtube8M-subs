 osama bin laden were alive 2006 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.979
 precisely as a result of same-sex orgy 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.100

 this whole event was held under 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:48.240
 the action of steroids mps as a result 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.940
 what appeared for the child does not even 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.210
 it is known what it is and how what we have we 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.190
 we have huge wheels 18 radius clearance 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.200
 two hundred and five millimeters turbocharged 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.960
 engine forked exhaust system 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.910
 This car got imitation 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.780
 full drive only girls 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:10.110
 really versed in this matter 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.720
 238 horsepower 8 and 3 seconds to 100 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.590
 this car should tumble even on 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.080
 after years 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:19.230
 design remained relevant people 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.810
 invented the design of this car it 

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.910
 u koizumi japanese yes oddly enough 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.190
 once told that in Darwin on 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:28.440
 the creation of this car came to him 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.980
 when he was in the gym during 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:34.019
 workout probably inspired him smells 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.030
 wonderful smells of sweat glands from here 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.040
 conclusion need to go to the gym more often then 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.890
 you too will cast something and you will think 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.560
 sausage general view of the car so far 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.540
 in the stream remains relevant then this 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.100
 it was progressive yes he has a lot 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:52.019
 jambs because it was made 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.630
 Hiroshima for the American market here 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.209
 You can understand the Japanese why it breaks 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.060
 constantly why him expense which 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.860
 stirs the minds of people in general 30 liters 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 if you move I don't know 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:09.390
 city ​​limits 30 liters we are on the highway 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:12.600
 there is 2522 but if it goes like a grandfather 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.269
 probably even like grandfather 23 

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:16.590
 the most important thing in general is this car 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.530
 what can you 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.660
 quietly humiliate 85 percent 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.160
 motorist if your all nodes and 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.550
 aggregates and are in good condition 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.550
 condition 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:59.240
 getting into the cabin of the car immediately 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.640
 the question is where to put me this 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:04.400
 chip card yes i already know what the haters 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.560
 they will say I even hear what they say 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.930
 put a fool in your pocket 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.700
 you need to put everything in your pocket and where else 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.780
 then I have no pockets here I sit 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:16.670
 where do i put it where or shove me 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.130
 I don't know what they meant by 

00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:21.620
 that i don't want to do everything massage 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.940
 prostate imagine that this is a glass and 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.070
 put under the glass 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:27.530
 joy here there are two sockets that's it 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:29.030
 happy why manufacturers do not 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:32.660
 immediately 220 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:35.090
 well why not why do the adapter and 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.610
 something else but 220 immediately included all 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.840
 TV watching the fridge but a little 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.560
 need to turn on and 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:46.460
 No 220 adapter and there are millions of total 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.450
 we do this work for ourselves 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.740
 Multifunction buttons on the steering wheel there everything 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:53.330
 climate control 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:55.640
 the sensors are all worth it 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:57.590
 six-speed torque converter and 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.200
 as usual, all people are accustomed to on the machine 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:04.400
 two gas and brake pedals here three pedals 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.880
 there is still one pedal and but it is the handbrake 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:11.660
 Well, as the handbrake is a parking light 

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:14.120
 brake once all so here are three pedals 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.150
 music bass food is very much here 

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:20.110
 speakers here is an amplifier here 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:23.660
 sit changer for 6 CDs 

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.300
 the signal is also pretty nice in 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.780
 Generally and the Japanese do not bother 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:31.669
 about the salon office they took the skin i 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.030
 I do not know the bear lila everything is like this 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.120
 they fought and we now see a vision and put in 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:41.990
 interior just does it quality 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.990
 Finishing materials and insulation for these 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:47.780
 the money they ask but might 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:50.030
 be better but since we know for whom 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:51.449
 this car was made and why is it why we 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:53.129
 we do not pay for it 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:57.689
 even in our picking here 

00:05:53.129 --> 00:06:00.169
 electro-sitting it works 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:02.459
 sound but this sound does not negate the shadow 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:04.769
 will say again there you have a miracle 

00:06:02.459 --> 00:06:06.110
 happens you sat down immediately you 

00:06:04.769 --> 00:06:09.449
 three-spoke steering wheel 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:11.969
 three wells recessed arrows 

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:14.299
 lowered down when the car is total 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:18.509
 resting state is also so sporty 

00:06:14.299 --> 00:06:22.439
 red light it too but here it is 

00:06:18.509 --> 00:06:24.899
 all dispute and 30 liters of water before sport too 

00:06:22.439 --> 00:06:27.209
 the rest I do not know, so here even 3 

00:06:24.899 --> 00:06:30.319
 ceiling nifigase 3 ceiling they did 

00:06:27.209 --> 00:06:33.509
 Us trunk Yes well this is probably comfortable 

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:36.179
 according to statistics after watching our show 

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:39.029
 dramatically increases the number of suicides among 

00:06:36.179 --> 00:06:42.659
 bio robots and we conclude that 

00:06:39.029 --> 00:06:45.089
 times that same-sex love same-sex marriage 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.519
 no good cause can 

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:50.279
 exactly and with this car this is the obvious 

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:52.829
 example is a brightly flashed star she 

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:55.289
 went out everything is all about her forgot she did not 

00:06:52.829 --> 00:06:57.719
 left no one behind her successors on 

00:06:55.289 --> 00:06:58.709
 the cx-5 conveyor does not consider this at all 

00:06:57.719 --> 00:07:00.719
 another car 

00:06:58.709 --> 00:07:04.289
 so maybe someday we 

00:07:00.719 --> 00:07:07.829
 live and see the reincarnation of mazda cx-7 

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:09.979
 but it will be a completely different story to everyone 

00:07:07.829 --> 00:07:12.979
 good luck bye 

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:12.979
 I'll see you
