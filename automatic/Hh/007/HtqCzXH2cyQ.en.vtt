00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
cd-rom you can tell that for example

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.620 
cd-rom you can tell that for example
let's<00:00:37.950> look<00:00:38.010> at<00:00:38.190> 1919<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> see<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.570> many

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
let's look at 1919 and see how many

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.750 
let's look at 1919 and see how many
dates<00:00:40.230> come<00:00:40.470> up<00:00:40.590> two<00:00:41.070> thousand<00:00:41.520> three<00:00:41.610> hundred

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
dates come up two thousand three hundred

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
dates come up two thousand three hundred
seventy-five

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
seventy-five

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.120 
seventy-five
let's<00:00:44.070> see<00:00:44.360> 1914<00:00:45.620> six<00:00:46.620> thousand<00:00:46.980> three

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:47.130 
let's see 1914 six thousand three

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:48.680 
let's see 1914 six thousand three
hundred<00:00:47.220> ninety-eight<00:00:47.670> but<00:00:48.360> then<00:00:48.480> other

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
hundred ninety-eight but then other

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.950 
hundred ninety-eight but then other
dates<00:00:48.989> this<00:00:49.290> is<00:00:49.410> not<00:00:49.560> just<00:00:49.770> a<00:00:49.860> a<00:00:50.870> coincidence

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
dates this is not just a a coincidence

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.479 
dates this is not just a a coincidence
other<00:00:52.140> dates<00:00:52.410> are<00:00:52.620> not<00:00:52.710> so<00:00:52.920> important<00:00:53.370> for

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
other dates are not so important for

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:02.240 
other dates are not so important for
example<00:00:54.020> 1928<00:00:55.940> 466<00:00:57.860> 1929<00:00:59.480> 433<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.980> dates<00:01:01.980> are

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
example 1928 466 1929 433 so dates are

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.100 
example 1928 466 1929 433 so dates are
very<00:01:02.730> important<00:01:03.239> for<00:01:03.360> jobless<00:01:03.690> witnesses

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
very important for jobless witnesses

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.940 
very important for jobless witnesses
because<00:01:04.470> because<00:01:05.070> they<00:01:05.400> concentrate<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.950> 1919

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
because because they concentrate on 1919

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.230 
because because they concentrate on 1919
and<00:01:08.280> 1914<00:01:09.030> more<00:01:09.720> than<00:01:09.930> other<00:01:10.170> years<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.310> 1919

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
and 1914 more than other years so 1919

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.060 
and 1914 more than other years so 1919
is<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.510> very<00:01:12.840> important<00:01:13.290> date<00:01:13.440> for<00:01:13.470> Jehovah's

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
the chronology let's let's take for a

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.640 
the chronology let's let's take for a
moment<00:01:42.659> or<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:42.900> think<00:01:43.020> for<00:01:43.200> a<00:01:43.259> moment<00:01:43.409> that

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:43.650 
moment or let's think for a moment that

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.600 
moment or let's think for a moment that
the<00:01:44.009> year<00:01:44.280> 1914<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.560> accurate<00:01:46.560> let's<00:01:47.220> set

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
the year 1914 is accurate let's set

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.429 
the year 1914 is accurate let's set
aside<00:01:47.640> any<00:01:48.000> doubts<00:01:48.270> about<00:01:48.420> 1914<00:01:49.229> at<00:01:49.380> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
aside any doubts about 1914 at the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.880 
aside any doubts about 1914 at the
moment<00:01:49.770> and<00:01:50.390> let's<00:01:51.390> think<00:01:51.600> about<00:01:51.900> does<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
moment and let's think about does the

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.060 
moment and let's think about does the
Bible<00:01:53.250> actually<00:01:53.729> point<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.150> 1919<00:01:55.049> well<00:01:55.979> how

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
Bible actually point to 1919 well how

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.850 
Bible actually point to 1919 well how
does<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.220> watchtower<00:01:56.700> come<00:01:57.030> up<00:01:57.180> with<00:01:57.390> 1919<00:01:58.259> it's

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
does a watchtower come up with 1919 it's

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.140 
does a watchtower come up with 1919 it's
so<00:01:59.040> we<00:01:59.280> just<00:01:59.430> type<00:01:59.670> in<00:01:59.909> 1919

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.150 
so we just type in 1919

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:05.100 
so we just type in 1919
calculation<00:02:01.990> and<00:02:02.110> see<00:02:02.290> what<00:02:02.410> happens

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.520 

let's<00:02:05.590> see<00:02:05.970> 1919<00:02:06.970> dates<00:02:07.840> of<00:02:08.080> prophetic

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
let's see 1919 dates of prophetic

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.160 
let's see 1919 dates of prophetic
significance<00:02:09.119> aha<00:02:10.149> here<00:02:10.479> we<00:02:10.630> have<00:02:10.810> a<00:02:10.840> number

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
significance aha here we have a number

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.500 
significance aha here we have a number
