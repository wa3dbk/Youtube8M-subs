00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello today there is one again 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.870
 correct review on two products 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.120
 that's what media wants 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.370
 news palette and one of l'oreal the la 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.110
 palette nude and indeed are the year 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.759
 Both products are now relatively new 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.680
 I have both 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.500
 bought at dm that is she gives it 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.150
 but only in these slightly larger ones 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.590
 Aufstellern and I also think 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.490
 rossmann it soon I give 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.470
 become one with you today 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.449
 do not compare that for everyone 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.369
 know if they even one of them 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.470
 to pick or or 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.210
 which of which ones is better and 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.730
 That's why I would say put directly 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.190
 first off with the Eckdaten the of 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.760
 medellín has a total of twelve colors and 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:44.430
 costs 9 euro 99 and that of l'oreal has 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.950
 a total of ten colors and costs 19 99 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.210
 So I think that's already one 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.010
 blatant price difference namely 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.629
 a total of ten euros more so that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.280
 I think of the double design 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.739
 very nice families because they are 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.030
 so a year window has quasi and you 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.420
 already see the colors a bit 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.850
 can 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.079
 reminds me a little bit of these 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:03.570
 Metabolic pallets there it is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:07.350
 the same way and the division is 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.810
 actually as easy to correct 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.220
 and that are always quasi quads with 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 which one can paint so if you have one 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.760
 may want to have certain look then 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.680
 you also choose a quad and 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.810
 make up the look from it or just 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.220
 this or this quarter but you 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.060
 Of course you can mix that as well 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.890
 you want that 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.990
 and there was an applicator in there too 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.780
 So yes included a no brush 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.090
 but an applicator then at the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.799
 palette of l'oréal is a brush 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.420
 that really has 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.860
 on the one hand brushes 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.770
 and on the other , that's a normal one 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.750
 applicator and he has ten now 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.970
 different colors the man bund 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.890
 It can be reminiscent of one another 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.020
 me a bit of adecco I think 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 So the palette is as well as these 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.619
 single adecco eyeshadow the man 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.610
 Being able to put yourself together like this looks like this 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.170
 it a bit off 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.820
 I'm getting a little bit bigger 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.460
 So I always thought that 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:58.590
 who is a bit bigger 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.600
 I know at least I had the denser 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.790
 impression pauli I found now in 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.799
 original a bit smaller 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.659
 Nevertheless, of course, the colors are in the 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.459
 foreground and I would say that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.690
 should have us through it now 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.640
 Here are my switches 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.110
 prepared at the l'oréal 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 Today I think the colors are right 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.500
 So succeeded the first that is 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.630
 actually such a pretty bright 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.610
 highlighter ton of shimmer in it the 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.920
 second color is also a nice color 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:24.810
 but a bit apricot 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.360
 some love such colors some 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.070
 they tend to be a bit like me 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.470
 am something between laase depending on whether 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.730
 the look fits the third color is 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.190
 One of my favorite riders I think 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.010
 They are perfect for the entire eyelid 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.660
 or just for the crisis you like that 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.040
 have a completely natural eye make-up 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.310
 would like the fourth color is such a 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:47.250
 duller raging and the fifth is like that 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.230
 a real yellow gold I believe that 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.790
 so that many have difficulties 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.500
 and I do not know it myself 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.390
 all I have to do with it is me 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.269
 I think I'll avoid that too and 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:59.850
 in no lux then wear the next 

00:02:57.269 --> 00:03:02.730
 is neither a very nice brown tone a 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.130
 slightly cooler brown tone and the next 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.830
 is a warmer brown so do both 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.140
 also matt and relatively well pigmented 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.350
 After that comes a glitter again 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.019
 namely, such a rusty brown and then 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:17.850
 a slightly darker brown again and 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.110
 Finally, of course, this mat 

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.820
 black color 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.890
 I think the mixture of shimmer and 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.459
 Matt very very successful in this 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.250
 palette 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:29.010
 I think the pigmentation is good 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.530
 is okay but she is weaker than at 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:33.630
 the media palette but not 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.640
 bad in general then we come 

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:37.799
 now to the media palette and there is 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.000
 The first color is quite difficult 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.519
 I first thought that would be such a 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.900
 nice neutral champagne highlight 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:44.070
 has and you feel so in the interior 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.760
 angle can give 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.320
 but has so yes so scarlet iridescent 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.690
 Shimmer in it and I think that fits 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:54.120
 then not at all and therefore avoid it 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.739
 I have that color the time I have 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.840
 a little prettier that's the way it is 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:59.670
 a party with a glimmer in it the third 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.310
 color in this first nonsense that is 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:05.130
 also a brownish one with golden ones 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:07.019
 shimmer and the feet is such a dark 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.810
 matt brown so I think the first 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.700
 quarter well done except these 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.130
 very bright highlighter color with this 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:16.019
 iridescent the second quarter very much 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.959
 very good because the first color is like that 

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:21.180
 a matt vanilla and I love those 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.830
 So I always need colors 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.370
 definitely a color if I am 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.410
 an eye 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 Make-up removal and exactly this color is 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:29.190
 that's me in this l'oréal palette 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.900
 is totally missing and you always notice 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.000
 if you sit at the dressing table and 

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.470
 wants to start making up 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.300
 and then you see ok in this first 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.930
 palette is not a color somehow 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.160
 in it 

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.780
 that's why it's a big one 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.419
 minus point for me now at this 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.020
 l'oréal palette then the next colors 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:48.419
 the cut is a yes a brown but also 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.010
 with a lot of gold screen share in it 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.410
 the fourth color is one again 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.240
 really great yellow gold like us too 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.830
 already had in the l'oréal palette 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.479
 I do not know if we have 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.729
 probably broken off in these 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.470
 gold tone also with this I can 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:02.970
 do not start that much but that's one 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.610
 a bit warmer than the one in the 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.830
 l'oréal palette then the last sound in 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.870
 the quad is such a thing 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.820
 darker brown tone is also like that 

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.260
 bit in eggplant with purely with 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.120
 schema the fourth quarter is one 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:17.280
 Little smoke league from the colors 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.470
 and it also starts with such a dull one 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.070
 raged that I find very nice 

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:24.720
 The second color is such a gray one 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.060
 already a bit darker 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.520
 every case is the fourth again 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:31.229
 a very nice nature a very very 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.030
 nice spanish tone 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:34.289
 I think that's a bit too 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.419
 be careful if you can do it that way 

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:39.000
 wants to put some highlight and 

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:41.340
 last color is again so half 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.990
 dull black so actually is yes 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.520
 even a bit worse share 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.110
 but this is somehow included 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:47.760
 Any matt color in this range 

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.470
 if that's a bit more accurate 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:51.389
 Look then you can see there so easy 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.400
 shimmer particles in it but then 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:56.729
 also not in the eye it so it is then 

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:59.039
 No shimmering and that was the way they were 

00:05:56.729 --> 00:06:01.260
 colors as I said I think of the 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.820
 Media ranges are a bit better 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:04.830
 But you also pigment in this palette 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.479
 there is just color that I personally 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.250
 would not use and I think that 

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:10.169
 It really does so with everyone 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.729
 you buy such an entire range 

00:06:10.169 --> 00:06:13.770
 that it may have gives you 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:16.800
 actually never would use 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.870
 if it is called with palettes it is 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.610
 then not quite as good as you are 

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.169
 think the durability of the 

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:23.970
 colors in these two palettes 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.099
 actually satisfactory in the 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.570
 of course, it is like that 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:29.039
 you then applied them on the eye 

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:30.720
 has and goes over with the blended brush 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:33.060
 then you blur very much 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:35.640
 you can tell from it a bit 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.540
 the quality difference downright expensive 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:39.180
 pallets 

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:41.790
 like the king pallets but otherwise 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:43.560
 These are the good drugstore ranges though 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:45.840
 if I had to choose now 

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:47.520
 which I want to buy from it is missing 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.280
 me in this loya palette to everyone 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:51.870
 case the seeds matte beige tone the me 

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.580
 just always need 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:56.820
 and then, of course, too 

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.590
 Price difference is enormous and if 

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.840
 I'll look like that again 

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.520
 would say for me the media 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:04.410
 palette won what course one 

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:06.120
 Absolutely personal opinion is I know 

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:08.040
 that many have the l'oréal range 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:10.470
 We are very happy with it 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:12.360
 and I still hope tast myvideo 

00:07:10.470 --> 00:07:13.590
 It was helpful that you know the colors like that 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.260
 it could look a bit 

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:18.120
 pigmentation and then I'm curious 

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.170
 which you will look you wrote 

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:20.940
 I like you more now 

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:22.680
 has addressed the colors and 

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:25.020
 Do you ever buy one of them? 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:27.000
 will or will save even more 

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.130
 then link to the expensive pallets 

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.270
 I still have my last two videos and 

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:32.480
 See you next time 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:32.480
 again
