00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
this time around with much meteor feel

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.260 
this time around with much meteor feel
and<00:01:10.740> also<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.880> little<00:01:12.090> bit<00:01:12.180> more

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
and also it's a little bit more

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.210 
and also it's a little bit more
pronounced<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.530> it<00:01:13.619> comes<00:01:13.710> to<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.010> size

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
pronounced and when it comes to the size

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.859 
pronounced and when it comes to the size
they<00:01:14.460> are<00:01:14.490> actually<00:01:14.939> quite<00:01:15.060> similar<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
they are actually quite similar but the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.570 
they are actually quite similar but the
g3<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.439> definitely<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.100> bigger<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.460> two

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
g3 is definitely the bigger of the two

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.550 
g3 is definitely the bigger of the two
it's<00:01:18.360> still<00:01:18.570> amazing<00:01:18.810> how<00:01:19.080> close<00:01:19.350> they<00:01:19.530> are

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
it's still amazing how close they are

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.440 
it's still amazing how close they are
considering<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.369> g3<00:01:20.759> offers<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> lot

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
considering that the g3 offers a lot
