here to climb the wall once you climb on
top<00:00:21.119> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.359> wall<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.840> are<00:00:22.050> free<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.619> go

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
top of the wall you are free to go

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.580 
top of the wall you are free to go
pretty<00:00:23.279> much<00:00:23.369> anywhere<00:00:23.550> that<00:00:24.180> looks<00:00:24.600> solid<00:00:25.170> if

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
pretty much anywhere that looks solid if

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.040 
pretty much anywhere that looks solid if
the<00:00:25.980> ground<00:00:26.189> that<00:00:26.400> looks<00:00:26.730> like<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> is<00:00:27.630> fake<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the ground that looks like it is fake it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.710 
the ground that looks like it is fake it
probably<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.070> so<00:00:29.340> do<00:00:29.670> not<00:00:29.820> walk<00:00:30.150> on<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> or<00:00:30.599> you

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
probably is so do not walk on it or you

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.330 
probably is so do not walk on it or you
will<00:00:30.869> fall<00:00:31.080> through<00:00:31.230> and<00:00:31.349> die<00:00:31.529> once<00:00:32.099> you're<00:00:32.219> on

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
will fall through and die once you're on

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.130 
will fall through and die once you're on
top<00:00:32.489> there<00:00:32.669> is<00:00:32.759> a<00:00:32.790> couple<00:00:33.120> areas<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.870> this

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
top there is a couple areas like this

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.660 
top there is a couple areas like this
where<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> can<00:00:34.590> get<00:00:34.710> that<00:00:34.920> d<00:00:35.130> loads<00:00:35.370> the

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
where you can get that d loads the

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.420 
where you can get that d loads the
ground<00:00:36.030> around<00:00:36.630> you<00:00:36.840> makes<00:00:37.440> a<00:00:37.649> kind<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.160> cool

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
ground around you makes a kind of cool

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.250 
ground around you makes a kind of cool
visual<00:00:38.850> effect<00:00:39.149> but<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:39.570> so<00:00:39.899> cool<00:00:40.020> if<00:00:40.140> you're

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
visual effect but not so cool if you're

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.750 
visual effect but not so cool if you're
trying<00:00:40.500> to<00:00:40.559> actually<00:00:40.739> get<00:00:41.100> somewhere<00:00:41.489> other

than<00:00:42.660> that<00:00:43.110> you<00:00:43.559> are<00:00:43.770> free<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.460> use<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:45.000> paths

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
than that you are free to use the paths

than that you are free to use the paths
along<00:00:45.809> the<00:00:46.110> edges<00:00:46.559> of<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.890> maps<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.309> go<00:00:47.910> up<00:00:48.300> to

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
along the edges of the maps and go up to

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.029 
along the edges of the maps and go up to
the<00:00:48.690> structure<00:00:49.140> or<00:00:49.320> you<00:00:49.649> can<00:00:49.829> backtrack

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
the structure or you can backtrack

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.910 
the structure or you can backtrack
through<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:50.579> map<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:51.090> bit<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.680> that<00:00:52.680> is

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
through the map a little bit and that is

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.010 
through the map a little bit and that is
about<00:00:53.250> it<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.730> rest<00:00:54.210> of<00:00:54.360> this<00:00:54.480> video<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.989> just

about it the rest of this video is just
going<00:00:55.590> to<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.770> getting<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.550> structure<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
going to be getting to the structure and

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.090 
going to be getting to the structure and
climbing<00:00:57.870> up<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.109> side<00:00:58.289> of<00:00:58.320> it<00:00:58.530> hey<00:00:59.399> no<00:00:59.850> core
