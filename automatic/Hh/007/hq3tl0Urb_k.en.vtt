00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello we are the jacks and we are 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.660
 Claudia Pepelope Fajardo Alejandra 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.460
 lara and estefanía house today we are going to talk 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.799
 of one of the most important characters 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.529
 in the history of Mexican art frida 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.470
 Kahlo surely knows the lady of 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.470
 the militia and the good little mustache let's start 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.849
 the nation painting with yakarta state of 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.199
 mexico to be more exact musicians 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.349
 although there are more versions that claim that 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.840
 He was actually born on July 6, 1907 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.640
 zelaya with the city class to climb the 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.340
 cover of six years contracted 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.680
 poliomyelitis which atrophied the form 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.390
 conical to his muscles but this was not 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.210
 impediment for frida to continue 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.050
 struggling to continue his normal life with 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.630
 have made 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.180
 the teachers 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.980
 in high school where although I do not 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.860
 create was preparing to prepare their 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.020
 medicine studies 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.820
 for these years diego rivero had already 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:02.520
 appeared for the first time in life 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.309
 but still the love to see after 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.439
 all this when I was 16 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.030
 notimex 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:11.360
 that I had east of hitting a 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.360
 trolley car 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.580
 and his left leg 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.440
 this theory of the first studies 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.760
 but on the other hand with clear chances 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.800
 to start interested more with 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.620
 definitions the areas of those 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.780
 first income of the year of 1916 frida 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.180
 was very strong we learn the things of 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.000
 individual way without needing help from 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.980
 mother in the personal area love more 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.860
 great that had frida kahlo was undoubtedly 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.870
 the also famous painter diego rivera el 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.750
 despite being several years older than 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:50.750
 she won with his subjects 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.370
 Bicicletos were married in the year 1920 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.070
 despite being a relationship 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:56.870
 completely passionate turned out to be 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.300
 equally heartbreaking they looked 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:02.890
 wrapped in productivity scandals 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.890
 what led to the operation 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.040
 but for one year after either climb 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.040
 return against marriage 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.960
 there were numerous operations 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.610
 when I counted on the one who feels 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.290
 exploited the cause of death of 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.290
 this artist who is still unknown 

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.620
 what was with his life what yes 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.069
 We know with certainty that in each work 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.420
 the dead of his life 

00:02:34.069 --> 00:02:40.219
 the symbolisms of understanding is why 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.400
 that is qualified within the 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.400
 art 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:48.230
 and in friends but do not know what it is 

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.939
 the souffle itself the surrealism is a 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.310
 artistic movement that seeks to 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.950
 and represent a creation and reality 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.569
 imaginary dream subconscious and 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.180
 irrational or beyond reality 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.980
 physical even though frida swore and 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.019
 perjured not to belong to this current 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.030
 artistic since he said that his paintings 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:07.069
 they were only a reflection of their own reality 

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:09.319
 in the end I have to say yes when 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:12.139
 came to Andre the greatest defender 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:14.269
 of surrealism in his time and he said 

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.040
 that indeed his work was 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.290
 surreal because of his strangers 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.870
 symbolisms and juxtapositions of 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:23.090
 elements of his works and the Lord does not 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.650
 I was wrong the paintings paraded 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.689
 they are loaded with great content 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:28.459
 emotional this is because all your 

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:30.769
 works have something to do with some 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:32.719
 stage of his life iconography is the 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.430
 part that highlights what I get 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.150
 between all those ideas in a way 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.579
 creative 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.200
 by a popular touch then the 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.780
 picture that right now we will see how 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:45.349
 example is the following self-portrait with 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.030
 Julian of thorns of 1940 in this 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:49.250
 final portrait is painted as the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.769
 protagonist we can observe that in his 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.440
 neck there is a kind of crown of 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:54.120
 thorns 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.820
 this made us think that you want 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.350
 result as an artificial turn the 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:00.900
 thorns of the necklace are being buried 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:02.850
 in his neck so this is a symbol of 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.830
 pain that I still felt due to 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:08.370
 divorce beaten according to traditions 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:10.500
 ancient mexicans the dead hummingbird is 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.450
 used as a symbol of good luck in 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.550
 loves the other side on his shoulder 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.100
 left we can find a cat in 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:20.340
 black this is our culture and symbol 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:22.290
 of bad luck and death according to the psoe the 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.600
 cat is waiting to jump on the 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.300
 hummingbird of frida's neck of the other 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:29.560
 side we can find the monkey which 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.419
 it's a gift of the old level 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.060
 to meeting her hair the mini pose 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:36.220
 represent in resurrection and the same 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.290
 way in the background we can observe a 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:40.389
 tropical flower group we have to 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.880
 know that previously fine I wanted 

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:45.250
 paint a self-portrait for his lover 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.960
 Photographer nicolás murray we can 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.360
 say then that with all your 

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:50.790
 eccentric personality in the heat is 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:55.169
 very good for Mexican art 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.169
 globally recognized and adored
