00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.590 
to shoot some of the athletes and some
of<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.590> instructors<00:01:09.100> here<00:01:09.130> that<00:01:09.640> that<00:01:10.180> train

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:10.600 
of the instructors here that that train

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.270 
of the instructors here that that train
and<00:01:10.750> teach<00:01:10.870> here<00:01:11.110> at<00:01:11.170> Camp<00:01:11.500> Woodward<00:01:11.710> the

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
and teach here at Camp Woodward the

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:13.650 
and teach here at Camp Woodward the
phantom<00:01:12.580> camera<00:01:12.640> is<00:01:12.970> a<00:01:13.030> special<00:01:13.420> camera

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:13.660 
phantom camera is a special camera

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.810 
phantom camera is a special camera
because<00:01:14.080> it<00:01:14.230> can<00:01:14.350> shoot<00:01:14.620> at<00:01:14.890> high<00:01:15.220> frame<00:01:15.610> rate

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
because it can shoot at high frame rate

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.930 
because it can shoot at high frame rate
basically<00:01:16.540> what's<00:01:16.780> happening<00:01:16.980> is<00:01:17.980> I<00:01:18.220> mean<00:01:18.700> all

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
basically what's happening is I mean all

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.460 
basically what's happening is I mean all
this<00:01:19.150> information<00:01:19.450> is<00:01:19.870> hitting<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.170> sensor

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
this information is hitting the sensor

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.380 
this information is hitting the sensor
it's<00:01:20.830> it's<00:01:21.310> actually<00:01:21.640> buffering<00:01:22.150> in<00:01:22.270> the

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:22.390 
it's it's actually buffering in the

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.780 
it's it's actually buffering in the
camera<00:01:22.840> okay<00:01:23.560> but<00:01:24.070> what<00:01:24.190> happens<00:01:24.520> is<00:01:24.640> the

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:24.790 
camera okay but what happens is the

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.280 
camera okay but what happens is the
camera<00:01:25.060> processes<00:01:25.660> everything<00:01:25.990> at<00:01:26.110> a<00:01:26.140> high

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
camera processes everything at a high

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:27.990 
camera processes everything at a high
frame<00:01:26.590> rate<00:01:26.770> you<00:01:26.920> dictate<00:01:27.370> the<00:01:27.490> frame<00:01:27.670> rate<00:01:27.850> as

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.000 
frame rate you dictate the frame rate as

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.670 
frame rate you dictate the frame rate as
low<00:01:28.180> as<00:01:28.240> you<00:01:28.420> want<00:01:28.540> to<00:01:28.720> go<00:01:28.840> up<00:01:29.290> until<00:01:29.590> about

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
low as you want to go up until about

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.430 
low as you want to go up until about
twenty<00:01:30.190> five<00:01:30.369> hundred<00:01:30.400> frames<00:01:31.030> per<00:01:31.360> second<00:01:31.810> it

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
twenty five hundred frames per second it

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:33.600 
twenty five hundred frames per second it
probably<00:01:32.770> max<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.130> a<00:01:33.160> little<00:01:33.340> higher<00:01:33.580> but

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
probably max out a little higher but

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:40.109 
probably max out a little higher but
sacrifice<00:01:34.540> there's<00:01:34.810> resolution<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:38.770> then<00:01:39.119> my

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
sacrifice there's resolution and then my

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:41.790 
sacrifice there's resolution and then my

obviously you can see you can see the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.270 
obviously you can see you can see the
dynamic<00:02:33.630> in<00:02:33.750> any<00:02:34.020> stunt<00:02:34.500> as<00:02:34.710> far<00:02:34.950> as<00:02:35.070> what

down<00:02:36.960> yesterday<00:02:37.260> we<00:02:37.560> shot<00:02:37.710> a<00:02:37.770> lot<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.100> tricks

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
down yesterday we shot a lot of tricks

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.070 
down yesterday we shot a lot of tricks
on<00:02:38.460> the<00:02:38.550> boards<00:02:38.910> in<00:02:39.030> real<00:02:39.510> time<00:02:39.720> I'll<00:02:39.900> see<00:02:40.050> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
on the boards in real time I'll see a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.140 
on the boards in real time I'll see a
son<00:02:40.290> happening<00:02:40.740> in<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.160> fraction<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.670> a<00:02:41.760> second

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
son happening in a fraction of a second

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.090 
son happening in a fraction of a second
not<00:02:42.240> even<00:02:42.450> think<00:02:42.630> about<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> foot<00:02:43.020> work<00:02:43.380> but

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
not even think about the foot work but

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.380 
not even think about the foot work but
breaking<00:02:44.400> it<00:02:44.640> down<00:02:44.670> shooting<00:02:45.150> it<00:02:45.240> with<00:02:45.300> the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
breaking it down shooting it with the

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:46.550 
breaking it down shooting it with the
Phantom<00:02:45.690> yesterday<00:02:45.960> actually<00:02:46.050> got<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.440> see

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
Phantom yesterday actually got to see

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.170 
Phantom yesterday actually got to see
the<00:02:46.680> footwork<00:02:47.040> and<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.280> can<00:02:47.490> see<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.730> kind<00:02:48.090> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
the footwork and you can see the kind of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.910 
the footwork and you can see the kind of
talent<00:02:48.420> I<00:02:48.810> mean<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.380> don't<00:02:49.530> even<00:02:49.590> think<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
talent I mean I don't even think the

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.550 
talent I mean I don't even think the
brain<00:02:50.220> connects<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.450> how<00:02:51.630> fast<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.140> muscles

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
brain connects to how fast the muscles

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.740 
brain connects to how fast the muscles
can<00:02:52.770> move<00:02:52.980> and<00:02:53.220> flip<00:02:53.520> a<00:02:53.550> board<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.210> then

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
can move and flip a board and then

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.750 
can move and flip a board and then
landing<00:02:55.230> that<00:02:55.410> trick<00:02:55.770> all<00:02:56.040> in<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:56.370> fraction

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
landing that trick all in the fraction

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.220 
landing that trick all in the fraction
of<00:02:56.850> a<00:02:56.910> second<00:02:57.240> but<00:02:57.360> when<00:02:57.450> we<00:02:57.510> see<00:02:57.720> it<00:02:57.810> on<00:02:57.990> the

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
of a second but when we see it on the

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.710 
of a second but when we see it on the
phantom<00:02:58.560> camera<00:02:58.590> it<00:02:59.490> just<00:02:59.970> breaks<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.360> down<00:03:00.480> so

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
phantom camera it just breaks it down so

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.470 
phantom camera it just breaks it down so
slower<00:03:01.050> so<00:03:01.290> you<00:03:01.350> wonder<00:03:02.160> how<00:03:02.310> body<00:03:02.760> or<00:03:03.330> an

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
slower so you wonder how body or an

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.780 
slower so you wonder how body or an
athlete<00:03:03.780> can<00:03:03.930> function<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.590> fast<00:03:04.920> to<00:03:05.550> land

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
athlete can function so fast to land

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.449 
athlete can function so fast to land
that<00:03:05.970> trick<00:03:06.390> you<00:03:07.170> know<00:03:07.620> just<00:03:07.980> uh<00:03:08.100> just

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
that trick you know just uh just

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:24.559 
that trick you know just uh just
perfectly<00:03:09.450> you<00:03:09.990> don't<00:03:10.140> get<00:03:10.260> that<00:03:10.290> every<00:03:10.620> day

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:26.569
