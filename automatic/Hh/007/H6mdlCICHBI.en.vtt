that it's chipping on them now ceramic
is<00:00:39.420> not<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.140> strongest<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.829> materials<00:00:41.399> is

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
is not the strongest of materials is

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.000 
is not the strongest of materials is
actually<00:00:42.059> theoretically<00:00:42.750> easier<00:00:43.290> to<00:00:43.559> damage

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
actually theoretically easier to damage

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.520 
actually theoretically easier to damage
than<00:00:44.309> plastic<00:00:44.640> if<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.420> were<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.870> drop<00:00:46.289> this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
than plastic if you were to drop this

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.270 
than plastic if you were to drop this
from<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.219> very<00:00:47.700> small<00:00:47.820> height<00:00:49.280> theoretically

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
from a very small height theoretically

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.580 
from a very small height theoretically
it<00:00:50.460> would<00:00:50.640> break<00:00:50.940> very<00:00:51.420> easily<00:00:51.510> I<00:00:52.079> also<00:00:52.260> have

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
it would break very easily I also have

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
it would break very easily I also have
some<00:00:52.829> quirks<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> placement<00:00:54.239> of<00:00:54.300> the

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
some quirks with the placement of the

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.319 
some quirks with the placement of the
power<00:00:55.079> socket<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.980> power<00:00:56.190> button<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.940> volume

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
placement of the headphone socket is

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.030 
placement of the headphone socket is
more<00:01:02.460> of<00:01:02.579> just<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.940> preference<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.840> prefer<00:01:03.960> it<00:01:04.890> to

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
more of just a preference I prefer it to

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.070 
more of just a preference I prefer it to
be<00:01:05.189> on<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> bottom<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.360> when<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.600> comes<00:01:06.810> to

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
be on the bottom but when it comes to

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.340 
be on the bottom but when it comes to
the<00:01:07.229> power<00:01:07.530> socket<00:01:08.100> and<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.430> power<00:01:08.670> button

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350 
the power socket and the power button

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.469 
the power socket and the power button
those<00:01:10.350> just<00:01:10.799> don't<00:01:11.159> make<00:01:11.369> sense<00:01:11.430> to<00:01:12.119> me<00:01:12.150> when

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
those just don't make sense to me when

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.649 
those just don't make sense to me when
they<00:01:12.510> are<00:01:12.810> actually<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:14.189> wrong<00:01:14.460> place<00:01:14.880> by

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
they are actually in the wrong place by

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.990 
they are actually in the wrong place by
wrong<00:01:15.990> I<00:01:16.259> mean<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.799> power<00:01:17.009> socket<00:01:17.490> being<00:01:17.729> on

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
wrong I mean the power socket being on

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.359 
wrong I mean the power socket being on
the<00:01:18.299> side<00:01:18.630> of<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:18.930> device<00:01:19.259> and<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:20.100> power

back of this device near in the bottom
that's<00:01:45.210> quite<00:01:45.420> an<00:01:45.570> interesting<00:01:45.990> design

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
that's quite an interesting design

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.960 
that's quite an interesting design
choice<00:01:46.829> because<00:01:47.189> when<00:01:47.340> you're<00:01:47.490> holding<00:01:47.850> the

phone in your hand the sound amplifies

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.899 
phone in your hand the sound amplifies
around<00:01:51.360> your<00:01:51.630> hand<00:01:51.869> back<00:01:52.380> at<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.130> very

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
around your hand back at you very

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.760 
around your hand back at you very
interesting<00:01:54.630> to<00:01:54.780> put<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> there<00:01:55.320> and<00:01:55.530> quite

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
interesting to put it there and quite

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.069 
interesting to put it there and quite
clever<00:01:56.420> unfortunately<00:01:57.420> because<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> the<00:01:57.930> way

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
clever unfortunately because of the way

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.399 
clever unfortunately because of the way
is<00:01:58.229> designed<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:59.369> not<00:01:59.729> recessed<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.930> any<00:02:01.110> way

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
is designed it's not recessed in any way

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
is designed it's not recessed in any way
so<00:02:02.040> when<00:02:02.219> you<00:02:02.310> put<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.610> down<00:02:02.790> on<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.030> surface

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
so when you put it down on the surface

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.230 
so when you put it down on the surface
it<00:02:03.719> muffles<00:02:04.290> instead<00:02:04.860> of<00:02:04.979> amplifies<00:02:05.579> nothing

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
it muffles instead of amplifies nothing

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.389 
it muffles instead of amplifies nothing
that's<00:02:06.450> too<00:02:06.930> serious<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.740> actually<00:02:07.950> quite<00:02:08.340> like

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
that's too serious I actually quite like

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.460 
that's too serious I actually quite like
the<00:02:08.910> fact<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.239> when<00:02:09.390> I<00:02:09.420> hold<00:02:09.720> it<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:09.989> my<00:02:10.050> hand

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the fact that when I hold it in my hand

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.370 
the fact that when I hold it in my hand
it<00:02:10.709> amplifies<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.910> I<00:02:11.940> can<00:02:12.209> hear<00:02:12.390> it<00:02:12.540> better

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it amplifies so I can hear it better

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.260 
it amplifies so I can hear it better
like<00:02:13.530> I<00:02:13.680> said<00:02:13.920> it's<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.400> very<00:02:14.430> interesting

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
like I said it's a very interesting

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.230 
like I said it's a very interesting
design<00:02:15.600> choice<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.680> sometimes<00:02:17.520> I<00:02:17.910> put<00:02:18.120> the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
design choice but sometimes I put the

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.480 
design choice but sometimes I put the
phone<00:02:18.450> down<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.990> I'd<00:02:19.110> still<00:02:19.560> like<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.890> hear<00:02:20.280> my

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
phone down and I'd still like to hear my

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.150 
phone down and I'd still like to hear my
notifications<00:02:21.390> come<00:02:21.690> through<00:02:22.050> and<00:02:22.260> I<00:02:22.830> can't

is is also quite a bad point for me

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:42.290 
is is also quite a bad point for me
because<00:05:40.530> despite<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:41.520> fact<00:05:41.699> I'm<00:05:41.880> telling<00:05:42.210> it

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
because despite the fact I'm telling it

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:45.529 
because despite the fact I'm telling it
to<00:05:42.330> focus<00:05:42.810> on<00:05:42.960> the<00:05:43.080> wall<00:05:43.260> as<00:05:43.909> in<00:05:44.909> the<00:05:45.120> distance

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:45.539 
to focus on the wall as in the distance

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.070 
to focus on the wall as in the distance
it<00:05:45.720> continues<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.560> go<00:05:46.770> way<00:05:47.760> out<00:05:47.789> of<00:05:48.330> focus<00:05:48.570> so<00:05:49.050> I

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:49.080 
it continues to go way out of focus so I

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:51.589 
it continues to go way out of focus so I
feel<00:05:49.680> like<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:50.039> what<00:05:50.220> might<00:05:50.520> ruin<00:05:50.970> your
