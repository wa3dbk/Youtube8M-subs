actually handle the situation

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.920 
actually handle the situation
it<00:00:43.920> doesn't<00:00:44.309> just<00:00:44.489> do<00:00:45.300> something<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.840> gives

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
it doesn't just do something it gives

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.010 
it doesn't just do something it gives
you<00:00:46.110> options<00:00:49.160> it<00:00:50.160> also<00:00:50.309> shows<00:00:50.670> you<00:00:50.879> how<00:00:51.840> long

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
you options it also shows you how long

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.580 
you options it also shows you how long
until<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.469> rebels<00:00:52.920> are<00:00:53.910> going<00:00:54.000> to<00:00:54.660> succeed

and<00:00:56.480> break<00:00:57.480> away<00:00:57.629> from<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.320> then<00:00:58.980> there's

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
and break away from you and then there's

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.990 
and break away from you and then there's
also<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.899> base<00:01:00.899> revolvers<00:01:02.420> which<00:01:03.420> uses

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
also the base revolvers which uses

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.690 
also the base revolvers which uses
religious<00:01:06.000> unity<00:01:06.380> which<00:01:07.380> is<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> percent

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
religious unity which is just a percent

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.370 
religious unity which is just a percent
or<00:01:08.939> ratio<00:01:09.510> of<00:01:09.659> how<00:01:09.840> many<00:01:11.450> of<00:01:12.450> your<00:01:12.930> counties

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
or ratio of how many of your counties

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.679 
or ratio of how many of your counties
are<00:01:13.650> of<00:01:13.830> your<00:01:13.979> religion<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.670> how<00:01:15.360> many<00:01:15.540> of

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
are of your religion and how many of

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
are of your religion and how many of
them<00:01:15.810> are<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.229> so<00:01:16.790> I<00:01:17.790> have<00:01:17.970> three<00:01:18.240> that<00:01:18.390> are

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
them are not so I have three that are

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.950 
them are not so I have three that are
not<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.140> should<00:01:19.500> say<00:01:19.710> four<00:01:20.009> and<00:01:20.310> this<00:01:21.180> causes<00:01:21.570> me

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
not I should say four and this causes me

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:32.390 
not I should say four and this causes me
to<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:24.110> 79<00:01:26.360> or<00:01:27.360> 80<00:01:27.750> 9<00:01:30.350> 9<00:01:31.350> %<00:01:31.799> religious<00:01:32.220> you

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
to have 79 or 80 9 9 % religious you

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.480 
to have 79 or 80 9 9 % religious you
need

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.750 

so<00:01:36.920> another<00:01:37.920> thing<00:01:38.280> that's<00:01:38.430> kind<00:01:38.640> of

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
so another thing that's kind of

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.130 
so another thing that's kind of
interesting<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.420> let's<00:01:39.479> go<00:01:39.720> over<00:01:39.780> here<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
interesting so let's go over here to

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.880 
interesting so let's go over here to
Denmark<00:01:40.909> look<00:01:41.909> at<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.119> diplomacy<00:01:42.890> under

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
Denmark look at the diplomacy under

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.680 
Denmark look at the diplomacy under
covert<00:01:44.190> actions<00:01:44.940> there's<00:01:45.240> this<00:01:45.420> thing<00:01:45.659> called

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
covert actions there's this thing called

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.770 
covert actions there's this thing called
support<00:01:46.409> rebels<00:01:47.240> which<00:01:48.240> you<00:01:48.479> can<00:01:48.630> actually

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
support rebels which you can actually

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:55.730 
support rebels which you can actually
find<00:01:49.560> a<00:01:49.890> rebel<00:01:50.460> group<00:01:51.259> and<00:01:52.700> then<00:01:54.590> support<00:01:55.590> them

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
find a rebel group and then support them

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.760 
find a rebel group and then support them
I<00:01:58.159> don't<00:01:59.159> really<00:01:59.340> know<00:01:59.580> what<00:02:00.119> can<00:02:01.020> exactly<00:02:01.500> fix

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
I don't really know what can exactly fix

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.710 
I don't really know what can exactly fix
support<00:02:01.979> infantry<00:02:02.520> I'm<00:02:02.940> guessing<00:02:03.300> probably

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:03.720 
support infantry I'm guessing probably

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.910 
support infantry I'm guessing probably
some<00:02:04.229> high<00:02:04.409> dip<00:02:04.920> low<00:02:05.070> tech<00:02:05.780> or<00:02:06.780> maybe<00:02:07.320> national

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
some high dip low tech or maybe national

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:13.600 
some high dip low tech or maybe national
ideas<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.989> then<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.200> can<00:02:10.440> do<00:02:10.679> this<00:02:10.920> like

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:22.660 

slider<00:02:15.050> which<00:02:16.050> effects<00:02:16.590> as<00:02:17.070> you<00:02:17.160> can<00:02:18.000> see<00:02:18.239> the

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.230 

it<00:02:23.150> affects<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.750> units<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.140> spawn<00:02:24.500> I

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:25.240 
it affects the units that spawn I

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:32.220 
it affects the units that spawn I
believe<00:02:26.240> affects<00:02:27.020> how<00:02:27.170> many

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:38.170 

or<00:02:33.230> possibly<00:02:34.630> it<00:02:35.630> pays<00:02:36.080> their<00:02:36.500> war<00:02:36.860> debts<00:02:37.190> not

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
or possibly it pays their war debts not

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.070 
or possibly it pays their war debts not
exactly<00:02:38.540> sure<00:02:39.850> but<00:02:40.850> I'm<00:02:41.150> assuming<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.870> more

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.080 
exactly sure but I'm assuming the more

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.430 
exactly sure but I'm assuming the more
money<00:02:42.320> oh<00:02:42.700> yeah<00:02:43.700> yeah<00:02:44.150> see<00:02:44.510> that<00:02:44.780> money<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.230> so

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
money oh yeah yeah see that money and so

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.300 
money oh yeah yeah see that money and so
the<00:02:45.620> money<00:02:45.800> will<00:02:45.950> build<00:02:46.220> up<00:02:46.400> and<00:02:48.070> as<00:02:49.070> you<00:02:49.250> can

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
the money will build up and as you can

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.340 
the money will build up and as you can
see<00:02:49.370> total<00:02:49.730> infantry<00:02:50.240> cost<00:02:50.480> total<00:02:50.810> Calvary

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
see total infantry cost total Calvary

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.910 
see total infantry cost total Calvary
cost<00:02:51.620> utility<00:02:51.800> cost<00:02:52.340> it<00:02:52.700> will<00:02:53.560> they<00:02:54.560> will<00:02:54.740> use

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
cost utility cost it will they will use

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:58.600 
cost utility cost it will they will use
that<00:02:54.950> probably<00:02:55.610> to<00:02:55.820> fund<00:02:56.330> more<00:02:56.540> units<00:02:57.610> along

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
that probably to fund more units along

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.480 
that probably to fund more units along
with<00:02:58.910> this<00:02:59.300> it<00:03:00.050> increases<00:03:00.560> all<00:03:00.860> of<00:03:01.040> them<00:03:01.160> just

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.490
