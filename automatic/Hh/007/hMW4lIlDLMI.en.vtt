00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
this production is brought to you by the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.700 
this production is brought to you by the
University<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.810> Edinburgh

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.770 

welcome<00:00:08.710> along<00:00:08.950> in<00:00:09.180> this<00:00:10.180> session<00:00:10.450> we're

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
welcome along in this session we're

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.330 
welcome along in this session we're
going<00:00:10.870> to<00:00:10.930> look<00:00:11.110> at<00:00:11.230> using<00:00:11.410> functions<00:00:12.100> in

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:12.340 
going to look at using functions in

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.870 
going to look at using functions in
MATLAB<00:00:13.440> now<00:00:14.440> functions<00:00:14.889> are<00:00:15.190> another<00:00:15.550> type<00:00:15.820> of

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:15.880 
MATLAB now functions are another type of

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.670 
MATLAB now functions are another type of
M<00:00:16.209> file<00:00:16.540> so<00:00:17.259> similar<00:00:17.830> to<00:00:18.009> scripts<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.380> when<00:00:20.529> we

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:20.680 
M file so similar to scripts but when we

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.279 
M file so similar to scripts but when we
execute<00:00:21.160> a<00:00:21.279> script<00:00:21.430> the<00:00:22.419> variables<00:00:22.960> that<00:00:23.050> we

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:23.289 
execute a script the variables that we

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.410 
execute a script the variables that we
defined<00:00:23.680> in<00:00:23.859> the<00:00:23.949> script<00:00:24.310> exist<00:00:25.029> in<00:00:25.300> the

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:25.420 
defined in the script exist in the

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.810 
defined in the script exist in the
current<00:00:25.600> MATLAB<00:00:26.170> workspace<00:00:26.410> so<00:00:27.400> they<00:00:27.550> can<00:00:27.730> be

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
current MATLAB workspace so they can be

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.179 
current MATLAB workspace so they can be
accessed<00:00:28.330> through<00:00:28.480> other<00:00:28.810> scripts<00:00:29.289> and<00:00:29.529> other

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
accessed through other scripts and other

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.150 
accessed through other scripts and other
functions<00:00:30.730> in<00:00:31.019> a<00:00:32.019> function<00:00:32.439> however<00:00:32.650> any

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:33.160 
functions in a function however any

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.759 
functions in a function however any
variables<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.180> you<00:00:34.269> define<00:00:34.690> exist<00:00:35.559> only

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
variables that you define exist only

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:39.719 
variables that you define exist only
within<00:00:36.190> that<00:00:36.430> function<00:00:37.739> so<00:00:38.739> for<00:00:38.769> example<00:00:39.519> if

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:39.729 
within that function so for example if

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:42.570 
within that function so for example if
you<00:00:40.390> try<00:00:40.600> and<00:00:40.720> access<00:00:41.409> them<00:00:41.710> from<00:00:42.159> the<00:00:42.250> command

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:42.580 
you try and access them from the command

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.719 
you try and access them from the command
window<00:00:43.440> you'll<00:00:44.440> get<00:00:44.680> an<00:00:44.830> error<00:00:44.979> because<00:00:45.549> they

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:45.729 
window you'll get an error because they

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:47.729 
window you'll get an error because they
don't<00:00:45.940> exist<00:00:46.180> in<00:00:46.659> the<00:00:46.989> current<00:00:47.170> MATLAB

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
don't exist in the current MATLAB

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.130 
don't exist in the current MATLAB
workspace<00:00:47.979> you<00:00:48.909> only<00:00:49.180> exist<00:00:49.629> within<00:00:49.809> that

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:50.140 
workspace you only exist within that

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.740 
workspace you only exist within that
function<00:00:51.059> so<00:00:52.059> what<00:00:52.210> we're<00:00:52.330> going<00:00:52.420> to<00:00:52.479> do<00:00:52.629> in

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
function so what we're going to do in

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.859 
function so what we're going to do in
this<00:00:52.869> example<00:00:52.930> is<00:00:53.729> take<00:00:54.729> our<00:00:54.940> my<00:00:55.360> circle

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:55.869 
this example is take our my circle

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:57.390 
this example is take our my circle
script<00:00:56.199> that<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.530> created<00:00:56.860> in<00:00:57.220> the<00:00:57.280> last

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:57.400 
script that we created in the last

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.390 
script that we created in the last
screencast<00:00:58.089> and<00:00:58.769> convert<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.949> into<00:01:00.190> a

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:00.400 
screencast and convert it into a

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.960 
screencast and convert it into a
function<00:01:01.830> so<00:01:02.830> let's<00:01:03.040> open<00:01:03.220> up<00:01:03.580> from<00:01:03.879> the

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:03.970 
function so let's open up from the

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.000 
function so let's open up from the
current<00:01:04.180> directory<00:01:04.839> and<00:01:07.560> you<00:01:08.560> see<00:01:08.740> that<00:01:08.890> it

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 
current directory and you see that it

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.710 
current directory and you see that it
opens<00:01:09.340> in<00:01:09.549> the<00:01:09.670> editor<00:01:09.790> window<00:01:12.510> so<00:01:13.510> in<00:01:13.630> a

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:13.720 
opens in the editor window so in a

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.320 
opens in the editor window so in a
function<00:01:14.110> M<00:01:14.320> file<00:01:14.620> the<00:01:15.220> first<00:01:15.520> line<00:01:15.850> is<00:01:16.150> the

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
function M file the first line is the

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.390 
function M file the first line is the
function<00:01:16.750> definition<00:01:17.050> line<00:01:17.680> and<00:01:17.950> that<00:01:18.160> goes

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.400 
function definition line and that goes

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.750 
function definition line and that goes
at<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:18.760> top<00:01:18.970> of<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.270> script<00:01:19.600> and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:21.520> first

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
at the top of the script and the first

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:23.100 
at the top of the script and the first
thing<00:01:21.940> that<00:01:21.970> we<00:01:22.150> put<00:01:22.330> in<00:01:22.480> it<00:01:22.630> is<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.930> word

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
thing that we put in it is the word

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.800 
thing that we put in it is the word
function<00:01:23.740> and<00:01:23.920> that<00:01:24.610> just<00:01:24.850> tells<00:01:25.090> MATLAB<00:01:25.600> that

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:25.810 
function and that just tells MATLAB that

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.030 
function and that just tells MATLAB that
this<00:01:25.960> is<00:01:26.140> a<00:01:26.170> function<00:01:26.680> M<00:01:26.890> file<00:01:28.560> now<00:01:29.560> we<00:01:29.740> define

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
this is a function M file now we define

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.210 
this is a function M file now we define
the<00:01:30.100> output<00:01:30.430> arguments<00:01:31.270> of<00:01:31.390> our<00:01:31.510> function<00:01:31.990> and

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
the output arguments of our function and

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.250 
the output arguments of our function and
in<00:01:33.220> this<00:01:33.370> case<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:34.090> output<00:01:34.270> arguments<00:01:35.080> are

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:35.260 
in this case the output arguments are

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.450 
in this case the output arguments are
the<00:01:35.320> points<00:01:35.830> on<00:01:35.980> our<00:01:36.100> circle<00:01:36.610> x<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.600> y<00:01:37.810> so

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
the points on our circle x and y so

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.560 
the points on our circle x and y so
because<00:01:39.460> there's<00:01:39.700> more<00:01:39.880> than<00:01:39.940> one<00:01:40.270> output

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
because there's more than one output

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.660 
because there's more than one output
argument<00:01:41.260> we<00:01:41.830> need<00:01:41.980> to<00:01:42.100> use<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.400> square

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:42.670 
argument we need to use the square

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:48.420 
argument we need to use the square
bracket<00:01:43.180> notation<00:01:44.070> X<00:01:45.070> comma<00:01:45.580> Y<00:01:47.070> now<00:01:48.070> the<00:01:48.130> name

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
bracket notation X comma Y now the name

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:56.460 
bracket notation X comma Y now the name
of<00:01:48.610> our<00:01:48.730> function<00:01:50.040> we<00:01:51.040> will<00:01:51.159> call<00:01:51.400> that<00:01:55.470> my

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
of our function we will call that my

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:02.130 
of our function we will call that my
circle<00:01:58.320> FN<00:01:59.320> for<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.710> function<00:02:00.100> and<00:02:00.930> then<00:02:01.930> the

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
circle FN for a function and then the

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.960 
circle FN for a function and then the
input<00:02:02.320> arguments<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.250> the<00:02:03.340> function<00:02:03.370> which

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
input arguments to the function which

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.320 
input arguments to the function which
are<00:02:04.120> enclosed<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.720> round<00:02:04.990> brackets<00:02:05.530> and<00:02:06.330> the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
are enclosed in round brackets and the

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.539 
are enclosed in round brackets and the
only<00:02:07.510> input<00:02:07.960> argument<00:02:08.440> we<00:02:08.560> have<00:02:08.769> is<00:02:09.069> the

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:09.549 
only input argument we have is the

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:14.500 
only input argument we have is the
radius<00:02:09.909> of<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.179> circle<00:02:10.450> so<00:02:10.810> that<00:02:11.230> will<00:02:11.319> be<00:02:11.440> our

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.050 

No<00:02:15.810> we'll<00:02:16.020> just<00:02:16.200> delete<00:02:16.410> our<00:02:16.739> my<00:02:17.280> circle<00:02:17.730> em

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
No we'll just delete our my circle em

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:20.089 
No we'll just delete our my circle em
comment<00:02:18.569> because<00:02:19.560> that's<00:02:19.739> no<00:02:19.920> longer

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
comment because that's no longer

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.150 
comment because that's no longer
appropriate<00:02:20.459> and<00:02:21.530> we'll<00:02:22.530> change<00:02:22.800> the<00:02:22.980> word

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
appropriate and we'll change the word

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:31.449 
appropriate and we'll change the word
script<00:02:23.730> to<00:02:24.209> function

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.040 

we'll<00:02:32.459> also<00:02:32.640> modify<00:02:33.269> the<00:02:33.300> description

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
we'll also modify the description

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.740 
we'll also modify the description
slightly<00:02:34.530> because<00:02:35.250> as<00:02:35.819> we've<00:02:36.090> already<00:02:36.300> said

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
slightly because as we've already said

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.870 
slightly because as we've already said
the<00:02:37.230> output<00:02:37.680> of<00:02:37.769> our<00:02:37.950> function<00:02:38.370> is<00:02:38.550> going<00:02:38.730> to

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
the output of our function is going to

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:45.080 
the output of our function is going to
be<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.660> X&amp;Y<00:02:40.110> points<00:02:40.709> on<00:02:40.830> the<00:02:40.950> circle<00:02:44.090> we're

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
be the X&amp;Y points on the circle we're

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.820 
be the X&amp;Y points on the circle we're
also<00:02:45.239> going<00:02:45.510> to<00:02:45.690> adjust<00:02:45.959> our<00:02:46.319> variable

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:46.830 
also going to adjust our variable

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.280 
also going to adjust our variable
dictionary<00:02:47.340> slightly<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.720> we<00:02:48.810> know<00:02:48.959> what

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
dictionary slightly so that we know what

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.050 
dictionary slightly so that we know what
the<00:02:49.410> input<00:02:49.799> and<00:02:49.980> output<00:02:50.100> arguments<00:02:50.640> of<00:02:50.940> our

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the input and output arguments of our

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:59.330 
the input and output arguments of our
function<00:02:51.480> R<00:02:53.180> so<00:02:54.180> R<00:02:54.209> is<00:02:54.750> an<00:02:55.110> input<00:02:55.319> and<00:02:57.920> x<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.190> y

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 
function R so R is an input and x and y

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.009 
function R so R is an input and x and y
are<00:02:59.640> outputs<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:02.000> theta<00:03:03.000> is<00:03:03.330> a<00:03:03.360> local

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
are outputs and theta is a local

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:07.670 
are outputs and theta is a local
variable<00:03:04.069> to<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.190> function<00:03:06.380> so<00:03:07.380> the<00:03:07.470> next

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
variable to this function so the next

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.020 
variable to this function so the next
change<00:03:07.980> that<00:03:08.190> we<00:03:08.280> need<00:03:08.310> to<00:03:08.549> make<00:03:08.730> to<00:03:08.880> our

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
change that we need to make to our

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.880 
change that we need to make to our
script<00:03:09.360> is<00:03:10.069> to<00:03:11.069> remove<00:03:11.370> the<00:03:11.640> input<00:03:12.030> line

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
script is to remove the input line

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.070 
script is to remove the input line
because<00:03:13.890> now<00:03:14.069> our<00:03:14.430> function<00:03:14.970> will<00:03:15.180> take<00:03:15.840> in

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
because now our function will take in

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:19.400 
because now our function will take in
the<00:03:16.260> value<00:03:16.620> R<00:03:16.860> and<00:03:18.019> there's<00:03:19.019> no<00:03:19.170> need<00:03:19.350> to

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
the value R and there's no need to

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:22.310 
the value R and there's no need to
prompt<00:03:19.799> the<00:03:19.950> user<00:03:19.980> for<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> we<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> just

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
prompt the user for it so we can just

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.130 
prompt the user for it so we can just
delete<00:03:22.590> that<00:03:22.769> entire<00:03:23.160> line<00:03:23.989> from<00:03:24.989> our

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
delete that entire line from our

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.180 
delete that entire line from our
function<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:27.500> looking<00:03:28.500> at<00:03:28.590> the<00:03:28.680> rest<00:03:28.890> that

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
function and looking at the rest that

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.030 
function and looking at the rest that
should<00:03:29.400> all<00:03:29.549> work<00:03:29.790> fine<00:03:30.090> so<00:03:30.709> we<00:03:31.709> can<00:03:31.890> now

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.040 
should all work fine so we can now

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.920 
should all work fine so we can now
choose<00:03:32.310> file<00:03:33.319> save<00:03:34.319> as<00:03:35.359> and<00:03:36.359> we<00:03:36.480> need<00:03:36.630> to<00:03:36.750> make

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
choose file save as and we need to make

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:38.990 
choose file save as and we need to make
sure<00:03:37.170> we<00:03:37.350> save<00:03:37.590> our<00:03:37.799> function<00:03:38.310> with<00:03:38.819> the<00:03:38.970> same

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
sure we save our function with the same

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.910 
sure we save our function with the same
name<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.780> we<00:03:39.870> used<00:03:40.170> in<00:03:40.410> the<00:03:40.530> function

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
name that we used in the function

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.840 
name that we used in the function
definition<00:03:40.950> line<00:03:41.760> so<00:03:42.390> that's<00:03:42.600> my<00:03:42.900> circle

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
definition line so that's my circle

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:49.729 
definition line so that's my circle
underscore<00:03:44.850> FN<00:03:47.810> now<00:03:48.810> we're<00:03:49.019> ready<00:03:49.170> to<00:03:49.350> execute

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739 
underscore FN now we're ready to execute

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:52.490 
underscore FN now we're ready to execute
our<00:03:50.010> function<00:03:50.459> and<00:03:50.639> with<00:03:51.630> functions<00:03:52.079> we<00:03:52.290> can't

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
our function and with functions we can't

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.220 
our function and with functions we can't
just<00:03:52.739> simply<00:03:53.100> press<00:03:53.340> the<00:03:53.639> play<00:03:53.880> button<00:03:54.230> from

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
just simply press the play button from

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.289 
just simply press the play button from
the<00:03:55.350> editor<00:03:55.709> window<00:03:55.889> we<00:03:56.549> need<00:03:56.579> to<00:03:56.730> call<00:03:57.090> them

00:03:57.289 --> 00:03:57.299 
the editor window we need to call them

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:00.590 
the editor window we need to call them
from<00:03:57.540> the<00:03:57.569> command<00:03:57.959> line<00:03:59.180> so<00:04:00.180> we'll<00:04:00.299> go<00:04:00.420> into

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
from the command line so we'll go into

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:04.610 
from the command line so we'll go into
the<00:04:00.810> command<00:04:01.139> window<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.690> we<00:04:03.690> basically<00:04:04.079> use

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620 
the command window and we basically use

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.520 
the command window and we basically use
the<00:04:04.950> same<00:04:05.220> sand<00:04:05.579> tax<00:04:05.880> as<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:07.049> function

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the same sand tax as the function

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.449 
the same sand tax as the function
definition<00:04:07.739> line<00:04:09.590> so<00:04:10.590> we'll<00:04:10.799> see<00:04:11.010> that<00:04:11.190> we

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
definition line so we'll see that we

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.930 
definition line so we'll see that we
want<00:04:11.639> to<00:04:11.730> output<00:04:11.910> to<00:04:12.389> go<00:04:12.540> into<00:04:12.810> X&amp;Y<00:04:13.290> and<00:04:13.940> we're

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
want to output to go into X&amp;Y and we're

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.729 
want to output to go into X&amp;Y and we're
calling<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.420> function<00:04:15.600> my<00:04:16.139> circle<00:04:16.889> F<00:04:17.130> N<00:04:17.880> and

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
calling the function my circle F N and

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.259 
calling the function my circle F N and
we're<00:04:19.739> interested<00:04:19.950> in<00:04:20.250> plotting<00:04:20.459> a<00:04:20.760> circle<00:04:21.150> of

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:21.269 
we're interested in plotting a circle of

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:26.170 
we're interested in plotting a circle of
radius<00:04:21.299> two<00:04:22.970> so<00:04:23.970> our<00:04:24.090> MP<00:04:24.360> argument<00:04:24.900> R<00:04:25.080> is<00:04:25.380> two

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
radius two so our MP argument R is two

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:28.490 
radius two so our MP argument R is two
and<00:04:27.180> we<00:04:27.300> press<00:04:27.510> Enter

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
and we press Enter

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.530 
and we press Enter
and<00:04:28.890> we<00:04:29.130> find<00:04:29.370> MATLAB<00:04:29.790> returns<00:04:30.180> an<00:04:30.390> error

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:30.540 
and we find MATLAB returns an error

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.640 
and we find MATLAB returns an error
message<00:04:32.630> now<00:04:33.630> if<00:04:33.750> you<00:04:33.840> look<00:04:33.990> carefully<00:04:34.200> it's

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
message now if you look carefully it's

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:36.260 
message now if you look carefully it's
telling<00:04:35.040> us<00:04:35.160> that<00:04:35.310> there's<00:04:35.520> an<00:04:35.640> error<00:04:35.850> at<00:04:36.210> line

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
telling us that there's an error at line

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:39.950 
telling us that there's an error at line
15<00:04:37.020> of<00:04:37.320> our<00:04:37.650> function<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.270> we'll<00:04:39.390> click<00:04:39.660> that

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
15 of our function so we'll click that

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.630 
15 of our function so we'll click that
and<00:04:40.850> it's<00:04:41.850> seeing<00:04:42.150> that<00:04:42.420> R<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.500> not<00:04:43.770> defined<00:04:44.280> at

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
and it's seeing that R is not defined at

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.900 
and it's seeing that R is not defined at
this<00:04:44.880> line<00:04:45.150> and<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:46.890> reason<00:04:47.220> R<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.670> not

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
this line and the reason R is not

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.000 
this line and the reason R is not
defined<00:04:48.270> is<00:04:48.600> that<00:04:49.140> we've<00:04:49.260> left<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.740> clear-all

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
defined is that we've left the clear-all

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.420 
defined is that we've left the clear-all
command<00:04:50.730> in<00:04:51.030> our<00:04:51.720> function<00:04:52.230> and<00:04:52.430> what's

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
command in our function and what's

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.060 
command in our function and what's
happening<00:04:53.850> is<00:04:54.030> we<00:04:54.210> are<00:04:54.240> defining<00:04:54.720> our<00:04:55.140> as<00:04:55.440> -<00:04:55.770> in

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.070 
happening is we are defining our as - in

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:59.210 
happening is we are defining our as - in
the<00:04:56.970> command<00:04:57.300> window<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:58.560> when<00:04:58.710> we<00:04:58.830> execute

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
the command window but when we execute

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:01.610 
the command window but when we execute
our<00:04:59.490> function<00:05:00.000> we're<00:05:00.330> clearing<00:05:00.840> that<00:05:01.050> value

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
our function we're clearing that value
