one of the core foundations of that we

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.700 
one of the core foundations of that we
also<00:00:53.520> see<00:00:53.879> connectivity<00:00:54.809> when<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.289> comes<00:00:55.530> to

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
also see connectivity when it comes to

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.439 
also see connectivity when it comes to
the<00:00:55.800> infotainment<00:00:56.340> solutions<00:00:57.059> in<00:00:57.239> the

car remote heating of your car but we
also<00:01:05.549> see<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.030> new<00:01:06.180> dimension<00:01:06.360> coming<00:01:06.960> up

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
also see the new dimension coming up

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.170 
also see the new dimension coming up
when<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.350> comes<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.710> connected<00:01:08.400> safety<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
when it comes to connected safety and

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.630 
when it comes to connected safety and
that<00:01:09.689> will<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> very<00:01:10.080> important<00:01:10.950> part<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.460> us

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
that will be a very important part of us

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.690 
that will be a very important part of us
now<00:01:12.290> exploring<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.650> network<00:01:14.070> society

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
now exploring what the network society

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.700 
now exploring what the network society
is<00:01:14.760> all<00:01:14.909> about<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:16.020> when<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> comes<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.619> these

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
is all about so when it comes to these

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.010 
is all about so when it comes to these
type<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.009> innovations<00:01:17.790> it<00:01:18.240> is<00:01:18.360> important<00:01:18.960> for

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
type of innovations it is important for

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.289 
type of innovations it is important for
us<00:01:19.229> within<00:01:19.680> volvo<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.490> be<00:01:20.610> leading<00:01:20.850> the

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
us within volvo to be leading the

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.090 
us within volvo to be leading the
development<00:01:21.540> when<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.380> comes<00:01:22.560> to<00:01:22.710> connected

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
development when it comes to connected

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340 
development when it comes to connected
car<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.850> connected<00:01:24.210> customer<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.200> it

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
car the connected customer and what it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.200 
car the connected customer and what it
will<00:01:25.470> bring<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:25.979> society<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.000> most

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
will bring to the society the most

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
will bring to the society the most
important<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:27.990> actually<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.650> develop

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
important is actually that we develop

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
important is actually that we develop
capabilities<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:30.180> features<00:01:30.240> that<00:01:31.020> are

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
capabilities and features that are

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.469 
capabilities and features that are
consumers<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> customer<00:01:32.759> will<00:01:32.939> benefit<00:01:33.450> from

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
consumers and customer will benefit from

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.230 
consumers and customer will benefit from
long<00:01:34.259> term<00:01:34.439> wise<00:01:34.680> as<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.430> part<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:36.030> that

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
long term wise as a part of that

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.039 
long term wise as a part of that
naturally<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.470> type<00:01:37.829> of<00:01:37.880> events<00:01:38.880> and<00:01:39.750> also

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
naturally these type of events and also

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.780 
naturally these type of events and also
these<00:01:40.170> type<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.409> features<00:01:41.009> in<00:01:41.189> our<00:01:41.310> cars<00:01:41.579> are

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
these type of features in our cars are

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.149 
these type of features in our cars are
important<00:01:42.329> and<00:01:42.450> then<00:01:42.810> of<00:01:42.899> course<00:01:42.930> market<00:01:43.860> them

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
important and then of course market them

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.760 
important and then of course market them
and<00:01:44.399> also<00:01:44.549> tell<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.180> world<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:46.140> society

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
and also tell the world and the society

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.010 
and also tell the world and the society
what<00:01:47.280> our<00:01:47.520> cars<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:47.970> clinical<00:01:48.420> customers<00:01:48.869> are

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
what our cars and clinical customers are

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.260 
what our cars and clinical customers are
capable<00:01:49.350> of<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.130> becomes<00:01:50.520> an<00:01:50.820> important

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
capable of that becomes an important

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.600 
capable of that becomes an important
part<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.659> actually<00:01:51.840> moving<00:01:52.500> our<00:01:52.979> industry

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
part of actually moving our industry

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.030 
part of actually moving our industry
forward<00:01:53.939> I<00:01:54.149> think<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.380> see<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.799> when<00:01:55.950> it

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
forward I think what we see here when it

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.130 
forward I think what we see here when it
comes<00:01:56.280> to<00:01:56.579> two<00:01:56.909> challenges<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.689> well<00:01:57.960> as

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
comes to two challenges as well as

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.810 
comes to two challenges as well as
opportunities<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.460> we<00:01:59.579> see<00:01:59.790> a

but now what we've said is let's start

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.620 
but now what we've said is let's start
with<00:03:26.100> Guttenberg<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.850> then<00:03:27.120> let's<00:03:27.330> leverage

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
with Guttenberg and then let's leverage

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.840 
with Guttenberg and then let's leverage
that<00:03:27.930> knowledge<00:03:28.350> also<00:03:28.620> into<00:03:29.040> other<00:03:29.160> cities
