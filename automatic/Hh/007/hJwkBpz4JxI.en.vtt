now<00:00:14.930> this<00:00:15.320> is<00:00:15.410> a<00:00:15.469> team<00:00:15.650> pass<00:00:15.920> to<00:00:16.880> ctc<00:00:17.270> by<00:00:17.600> hugo

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 
now this is a team pass to ctc by hugo

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.240 
now this is a team pass to ctc by hugo
and<00:00:18.140> i<00:00:18.230> decided<00:00:18.560> to<00:00:18.650> use<00:00:18.680> it<00:00:18.860> because<00:00:18.950> i<00:00:19.070> was

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:19.250 
and i decided to use it because i was

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.010 
and i decided to use it because i was
pretty<00:00:19.490> comfortable<00:00:19.850> using<00:00:20.000> the<00:00:20.210> team<00:00:20.390> i'm

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
pretty comfortable using the team i'm

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.360 
pretty comfortable using the team i'm
actually<00:00:21.170> going<00:00:21.410> to<00:00:21.500> lead<00:00:21.650> our<00:00:21.680> tyranitar

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.370 
actually going to lead our tyranitar

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.440 
actually going to lead our tyranitar
because<00:00:22.610> it<00:00:22.730> looks<00:00:22.910> like<00:00:23.060> it<00:00:23.180> could

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:23.450 
because it looks like it could

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.540 
because it looks like it could
potentially<00:00:23.660> be<00:00:24.350> a<00:00:24.380> mixed<00:00:24.770> set<00:00:24.860> or<00:00:24.980> scarf<00:00:25.340> set

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:25.550 
potentially be a mixed set or scarf set

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:27.730 
potentially be a mixed set or scarf set
so<00:00:25.790> he<00:00:26.330> really<00:00:26.600> can't<00:00:26.840> play<00:00:26.960> around<00:00:27.260> at<00:00:27.470> early

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:27.740 
so he really can't play around at early

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.890 
so he really can't play around at early
game<00:00:27.950> because<00:00:28.940> he<00:00:29.120> really<00:00:29.480> needs<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.690> scout

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:29.900 
game because he really needs to scout

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.030 
game because he really needs to scout
out<00:00:30.050> to<00:00:30.170> see<00:00:30.290> what<00:00:30.440> said<00:00:30.590> it<00:00:30.710> is<00:00:30.800> so<00:00:30.920> I'm

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
is a bandage set but either way I'm

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.360 
is a bandage set but either way I'm
hoping<00:00:34.700> that<00:00:34.820> befalls<00:00:35.210> for<00:00:35.510> the<00:00:36.129> false<00:00:37.129> for<00:00:37.280> my

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
hoping that befalls for the false for my

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:38.890 
hoping that befalls for the false for my
play<00:00:37.610> so<00:00:38.210> I'm<00:00:38.300> gonna<00:00:38.390> switch<00:00:38.600> out<00:00:38.720> go<00:00:38.870> to

momentum as he switches out into mu and

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.080 
momentum as he switches out into mu and
this<00:00:48.650> is<00:00:48.800> gonna<00:00:48.980> give<00:00:49.310> me<00:00:49.340> a<00:00:49.550> free<00:00:49.700> kill<00:00:49.970> with

pulse<00:01:00.020> and<00:01:00.260> it<00:01:00.500> does<00:01:00.620> decent<00:01:00.920> amount<00:01:01.070> of

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
pulse and it does decent amount of

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.979 
pulse and it does decent amount of
damage<00:01:01.399> to<00:01:01.550> this<00:01:01.760> is<00:01:01.970> or<00:01:02.120> now<00:01:02.540> I<00:01:02.570> do<00:01:02.690> have<00:01:02.720> fire

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
damage to this is or now I do have fire

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.509 
damage to this is or now I do have fire
blasts<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:03.440> it<00:01:03.559> should<00:01:03.739> kill<00:01:04.009> this<00:01:04.189> is<00:01:04.339> or

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
blasts and it should kill this is or

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:06.670 
blasts and it should kill this is or
even<00:01:04.939> in<00:01:05.509> the<00:01:05.540> rain<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:06.049> I<00:01:06.229> don't<00:01:06.409> think<00:01:06.560> he's

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
even in the rain and I don't think he's

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.289 
even in the rain and I don't think he's
gonna<00:01:06.770> see<00:01:07.009> it<00:01:07.130> coming<00:01:07.460> so<00:01:07.640> he<00:01:07.909> actually<00:01:08.060> just

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:08.299 
gonna see it coming so he actually just

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.420 
gonna see it coming so he actually just
stays<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.689> there<00:01:08.950> thinking<00:01:09.950> that<00:01:10.130> he<00:01:10.190> can<00:01:10.310> take

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
stays in there thinking that he can take

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.070 
stays in there thinking that he can take
a<00:01:10.460> surf<00:01:10.729> and<00:01:10.880> potentially<00:01:11.600> go<00:01:11.690> for<00:01:11.870> like<00:01:12.020> a

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.080 
a surf and potentially go for like a

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
he goes up to technical trying evading

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.149 
he goes up to technical trying evading
the<00:01:17.870> toxic<00:01:18.200> oak<00:01:18.320> I<00:01:18.500> knew<00:01:18.680> that<00:01:18.860> he<00:01:18.950> was<00:01:19.070> gonna

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
the toxic oak I knew that he was gonna

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:21.190 
the toxic oak I knew that he was gonna
probably<00:01:19.549> switch<00:01:19.820> out<00:01:20.030> double<00:01:20.420> switch<00:01:20.600> but<00:01:21.170> I

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
probably switch out double switch but I

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.440 
probably switch out double switch but I
really<00:01:21.470> couldn't<00:01:21.560> take<00:01:21.890> the<00:01:22.010> risk<00:01:22.040> I<00:01:22.490> mean<00:01:23.210> a

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
really couldn't take the risk I mean a

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.810 
really couldn't take the risk I mean a
high<00:01:23.780> drag<00:01:23.990> on<00:01:24.110> can<00:01:24.500> really<00:01:25.100> beat<00:01:25.340> technical

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
high drag on can really beat technical

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.730 
high drag on can really beat technical
101<00:01:26.210> but<00:01:26.540> in<00:01:26.810> the<00:01:27.110> rain<00:01:27.290> it's<00:01:27.470> gonna<00:01:27.530> be<00:01:27.710> a

101 but in the rain it's gonna be a

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
but I kept thinking that he was gonna

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.720 
but I kept thinking that he was gonna
want<00:03:40.199> to<00:03:40.260> switch<00:03:40.409> out<00:03:40.590> so<00:03:41.220> he<00:03:41.340> goes<00:03:41.430> out<00:03:41.609> to

cure him here this is kind of miserable
for<00:03:43.470> me<00:03:43.500> because<00:03:43.829> he<00:03:43.919> does<00:03:44.069> have<00:03:44.099> pressure<00:03:44.519> but

00:03:44.869 --> 00:03:44.879 
for me because he does have pressure but

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:50.420 
for me because he does have pressure but
if<00:03:47.329> if<00:03:48.329> I<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:48.959> enough<00:03:49.290> damage<00:03:49.319> with<00:03:49.680> Jarboe<00:03:50.069> it

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
if if I do enough damage with Jarboe it

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.860 
if if I do enough damage with Jarboe it
should<00:03:50.669> be<00:03:50.790> enough<00:03:51.030> so<00:03:51.269> he's<00:03:51.449> gonna<00:03:51.629> go<00:03:51.840> for

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
should be enough so he's gonna go for

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.500 
should be enough so he's gonna go for
the<00:03:52.430> rooster<00:03:53.430> I<00:03:53.579> know<00:03:53.639> he<00:03:53.940> was<00:03:54.030> gonna<00:03:54.150> go<00:03:54.359> for

the rooster I know he was gonna go for

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:55.670 
the rooster I know he was gonna go for
us<00:03:54.629> I<00:03:54.720> could<00:03:54.900> have<00:03:54.989> went<00:03:55.079> for<00:03:55.229> lychee<00:03:55.500> but<00:03:55.650> I

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:55.680 
us I could have went for lychee but I

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:56.780 
us I could have went for lychee but I
think<00:03:55.889> Jerry<00:03:56.099> ball<00:03:56.250> was<00:03:56.370> still<00:03:56.549> the<00:03:56.639> better

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
think Jerry ball was still the better

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.149 
think Jerry ball was still the better
play<00:03:57.060> as<00:03:57.269> I<00:03:57.690> do<00:03:57.750> get<00:03:57.959> a<00:03:58.019> crit<00:03:58.319> it<00:03:58.829> kind<00:03:59.069> of

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
play as I do get a crit it kind of

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.319 
play as I do get a crit it kind of
matters<00:03:59.340> in<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.669> sense<00:03:59.699> that<00:03:59.909> it<00:04:00.120> would<00:04:00.150> have

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:00.329 
matters in the sense that it would have

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:01.819 
matters in the sense that it would have
forced<00:04:00.569> me<00:04:00.690> to<00:04:00.780> go<00:04:00.870> for<00:04:01.019> more<00:04:01.139> gyro<00:04:01.379> balls<00:04:01.620> but

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
forced me to go for more gyro balls but

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.199 
forced me to go for more gyro balls but
I<00:04:01.859> didn't<00:04:02.099> really<00:04:02.190> need<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.549> go<00:04:02.669> for<00:04:02.849> jar<00:04:03.000> balls

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
I didn't really need to go for jar balls

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:04.759 
I didn't really need to go for jar balls
against<00:04:03.449> anything<00:04:03.659> other<00:04:03.959> than<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.260> kiram<00:04:04.560> so

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:04.769 
against anything other than the kiram so
