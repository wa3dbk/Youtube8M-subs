00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.070
 for a while 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:22.550
 we have here 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.550
 those things you do not understand 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.590

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.260

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:39.170

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.420
 well of the new lcd color and cause and 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:44.149
 Well, I'm very excited this day. 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.070
 happy for this dlc because I already had 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.360
 time that we did not have a dlc I already had 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.519
 time I was bored with the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.440
 multiplayer with the usual maps and 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:53.449
 I'm going to tell you the truth about this time 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.370
 I've played with has been when I eat 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.750
 two hours this the new maps of 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.030
 multiplayer because they exist I have not played 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:01.100
 nothing more than what you are seeing right now 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.899
 which is like small type gameplay nothing 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.479
 more is the first hive I have not made 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:06.920
 nothing in extension this is very 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:08.780
 chingÃ³n the truth what this would be 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.330
 new wish that so I recommend it 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.979
 think about it and then buy it ok 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.320
 Well this because I'm going to teach you 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:17.210
 that would be the guide in which you go 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.060
 to be able this way in which you 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.590
 they will be able to achieve the achievement much xp 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.530
 ok to this new achievement that ends up arriving 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.840
 with this dlc is called many px 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:29.270
 forgive me and it is to complete 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.580
 the challenge of many px which is the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:33.710
 multiplayer and destroy a hive in 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.290
 the content pack 11 gay side that 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.080
 it's on the map this one 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 well in summary what we would have to 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:42.820
 to do would be to find four eggs of 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.830
 someone we have in the multiplayer in 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.270
 the four multiplayer maps the 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.860
 we're going to have to find that to 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.480
 I will give you what they are 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.370
 the locations of those four eggs 

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.870
 and once you complete your four eggs 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.210
 we would have to go extinction to 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:56.740
 destroy a hive that the first this 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.930
 egg would be on the map what it would be 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.220
 obviously did not obviate no no there is no this 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.780
 there is an order you do not tell it in the 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.610
 order that they want the first egg 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.710
 would be on the foc map they would have to 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.120
 to be close to what would be the 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:09.820
 cave would have to enter through the cave 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.230
 rather and they would have to find this one 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.810
 this waterfall that once we find 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.220
 the waterfall if we look down let's see 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.290
 that is the normal egg and 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.270
 we shoot and he's going to tell us that because 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.850
 we have the first egg of four that 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.830
 this is too easy so then the 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.920
 second map then I would be in with mind 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:28.360
 with mail I do not know which one is that good anymore 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.610
 well I do not know what it's called I think it's the 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.860
 from mexico here, because only 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:34.570
 appearing this in this case then see 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.670
 and I answered, I showed up on this side 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.350
 if you appear here then perfect 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.480
 If they do not appear here, they would have to 

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.980
 come out ok once appearing then 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.019
 would have to come this building 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.670
 on the stairs and here then then they go 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.069
 to see what would be the egg that you see in 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.019
 the building opposite you are shot and 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.299
 ready that we would already have what would be the 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.970
 second egg the third egg for what 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:56.470
 we found what would be the map of 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.120
 ignition on the ignition map so it 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.920
 would find in what would be this 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.200
 underground since we will have to 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.459
 enter by like tunnel type then then 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.390
 is going to see this is the most obvious egg 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:08.920
 that there is this good nothing bad we see it 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.540
 we shoot and then we would have the 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.239
 third or fourth I do not remember because I already 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.099
 The kings order but good due to 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:16.420
 It seems that it is the fourth one but for me it is 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.579
 the third and then the last 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.489
 so we would have this from the unemployment map 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.569
 whoever is on a pier is going to go I think 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.459
 that is I do not remember what it was called 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.849
 what was his name on this map 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:29.590
 this we would have to come to what 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.180
 it would be this part of the map on the dock 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.190
 in front of us, we will have whatever is 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.690
 egg is it needs a bit hidden 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.390
 you can enter it sniper can bring you what 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.040
 who want this and then this one already 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:41.260
 having the four eggs we would have 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.670
 that go extension and then then starting 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.060
 so starting they go to the first 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:47.250
 hive to which they come 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.290
 destroy it and ready we would have 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.239
 what this achievement would be 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.040
 give 200 of xp for each egg that 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.760
 let's find and the last one is going to give us 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.540
 village weave to our achievement plus 10 of 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.819
 xp or px 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:03.510
 rp as you want to call ok is a click 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:05.370
 very good that glitches an this is a 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.800
 very good trick is a very good interest 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:09.780
 since this could be the first step of 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.940
 list of c's for extension for nike 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.560
 which is possibly and this one the ex ok 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.239
 I the truth if I want there to be 

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.220
 interest in these maps so you can 

00:04:15.239 --> 00:04:18.660
 be more fun nes so well then 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.880
