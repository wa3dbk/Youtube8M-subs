00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
I've been going through some of these

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.699 
I've been going through some of these
things<00:02:09.220> myself<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.940> I'm<00:02:10.270> sort<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.709> dialoguing

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
things myself and I'm sort of dialoguing

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.089 
things myself and I'm sort of dialoguing
technique<00:02:12.310> that<00:02:12.940> I'm<00:02:13.120> finding<00:02:13.750> that<00:02:14.099> it's

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:15.099 
technique that I'm finding that it's

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:19.229 
technique that I'm finding that it's
very<00:02:15.430> healing<00:02:16.000> with<00:02:17.760> visualization<00:02:18.760> and

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
very healing with visualization and

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.440 
very healing with visualization and
meditation<00:02:19.930> and<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:21.459> since<00:02:21.760> this<00:02:21.970> is<00:02:22.150> just<00:02:22.180> an

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
meditation and so since this is just an

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.270 
meditation and so since this is just an
experiment<00:02:22.870> I'd<00:02:23.380> like<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.739> reach<00:02:23.890> out<00:02:24.130> to

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
experiment I'd like to reach out to

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.339 
experiment I'd like to reach out to

working<00:02:52.750> on<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.049> particular<00:02:53.440> field<00:02:54.370> of<00:02:54.640> energy

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
working on a particular field of energy

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.640 
working on a particular field of energy
right<00:02:55.540> now<00:02:55.569> that<00:02:56.700> it's<00:02:57.700> very<00:02:58.000> new<00:02:58.420> because<00:02:59.410> i'm

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
right now that it's very new because i'm

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.800 
right now that it's very new because i'm
going<00:03:00.010> through<00:03:00.250> something<00:03:00.519> but<00:03:00.910> it's<00:03:01.569> also

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
going through something but it's also

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.789 
going through something but it's also
telling<00:03:02.319> me<00:03:02.680> that<00:03:03.780> this<00:03:04.780> is<00:03:04.989> something<00:03:05.349> that's

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:05.799 
telling me that this is something that's

00:03:05.799 --> 00:03:08.009 
telling me that this is something that's
right<00:03:06.160> before<00:03:06.640> something<00:03:06.970> very<00:03:07.390> big<00:03:07.690> that's

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
right before something very big that's

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.140 
right before something very big that's
coming<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.799> we<00:03:09.040> need<00:03:09.220> to<00:03:09.250> know<00:03:09.519> how<00:03:09.640> to<00:03:09.670> handle

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
coming and we need to know how to handle

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.150 
coming and we need to know how to handle
this<00:03:10.299> energy<00:03:10.810> and<00:03:11.049> we<00:03:11.500> need<00:03:11.680> to<00:03:11.709> know<00:03:12.010> how<00:03:12.130> to

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
this energy and we need to know how to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.180 
this energy and we need to know how to
transform<00:03:12.850> this<00:03:13.120> energy<00:03:13.630> and<00:03:13.810> it's<00:03:14.350> you<00:03:15.160> know

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
transform this energy and it's you know

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:17.039 
transform this energy and it's you know
the<00:03:15.430> actual<00:03:15.609> cause<00:03:16.090> of<00:03:16.120> the<00:03:16.390> energy<00:03:16.720> is<00:03:16.840> not

00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:17.049 
the actual cause of the energy is not

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.400 
the actual cause of the energy is not
important<00:03:18.060> of<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.359> depression<00:03:19.660> or<00:03:20.109> whatever

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
important of the depression or whatever

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.410 
important of the depression or whatever
you're<00:03:20.560> going<00:03:20.709> through<00:03:20.859> it's<00:03:21.310> how<00:03:21.760> you<00:03:21.820> handle

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
you're going through it's how you handle

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.410 
you're going through it's how you handle
this<00:03:23.079> energy<00:03:23.620> that's<00:03:23.980> inside<00:03:24.670> of<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.090> how

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:25.420 
this energy that's inside of you and how

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.990 
this energy that's inside of you and how
you<00:03:25.480> release<00:03:26.410> it<00:03:26.440> and<00:03:26.859> change<00:03:27.250> and<00:03:27.549> shift<00:03:27.790> that

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
you release it and change and shift that

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.729 
you release it and change and shift that
energy<00:03:28.480> so<00:03:29.019> I've<00:03:29.680> been<00:03:29.920> working<00:03:30.480> diligently

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
energy so I've been working diligently

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.720 
energy so I've been working diligently
almost<00:03:33.269> you<00:03:34.269> know<00:03:34.530> twenty<00:03:35.530> four<00:03:35.739> seven<00:03:35.769> of<00:03:36.400> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
almost you know twenty four seven of the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:39.030 
almost you know twenty four seven of the
past<00:03:36.970> several<00:03:37.209> weeks<00:03:37.650> because<00:03:38.650> I've<00:03:38.829> had<00:03:38.980> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
past several weeks because I've had to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.460 
past several weeks because I've had to
work<00:03:39.100> on<00:03:39.370> myself<00:03:39.549> but<00:03:40.120> I<00:03:40.150> see<00:03:40.510> some<00:03:40.930> thing

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
work on myself but I see some thing

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.400 
work on myself but I see some thing
that's<00:03:42.190> emerging<00:03:43.000> that<00:03:43.840> I'll<00:03:43.989> be<00:03:44.140> writing

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
that's emerging that I'll be writing

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.280 
that's emerging that I'll be writing
about<00:03:44.650> and<00:03:45.269> putting<00:03:46.269> forth<00:03:46.510> to<00:03:46.720> our<00:03:46.840> viewers

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
about and putting forth to our viewers

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.080 
about and putting forth to our viewers
but<00:03:47.319> in<00:03:47.620> the<00:03:47.739> meantime<00:03:47.950> if<00:03:48.280> there<00:03:48.459> are<00:03:48.639> people

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
but in the meantime if there are people

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:51.930 
but in the meantime if there are people
out<00:03:49.269> there<00:03:49.299> I'd<00:03:49.600> like<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.139> see<00:03:50.950> if<00:03:51.579> this

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
out there I'd like to just see if this

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.680 
out there I'd like to just see if this
what<00:03:52.540> I'm<00:03:52.720> doing<00:03:53.109> works<00:03:53.380> for<00:03:54.280> them<00:03:54.480> or<00:03:55.480> it's

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:55.690 
what I'm doing works for them or it's

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.800 
what I'm doing works for them or it's
helpful<00:03:55.930> to<00:03:56.109> them<00:03:56.380> and<00:03:56.650> it's<00:03:57.459> a<00:03:58.329> tremendous

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
helpful to them and it's a tremendous

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.599 
helpful to them and it's a tremendous
healing<00:04:00.660> technique<00:04:01.660> if<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:02.739> if<00:04:02.889> you<00:04:03.040> are<00:04:03.250> I

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:03.609 
healing technique if so if you are I

00:04:03.609 --> 00:04:04.340 
healing technique if so if you are I
mean<00:04:03.790> I'm<00:04:03.910> not<00:04:04.030> saying

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:04.350 
mean I'm not saying

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:06.590 
mean I'm not saying
can<00:04:04.530> heal<00:04:04.710> cancer<00:04:04.920> anything<00:04:05.580> but<00:04:06.030> if<00:04:06.150> you<00:04:06.300> are

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600 
can heal cancer anything but if you are

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.970 
can heal cancer anything but if you are
going<00:04:07.500> through<00:04:07.830> an<00:04:07.980> emotional<00:04:08.340> especially

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:09.980 
going through an emotional especially

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.740 
going through an emotional especially
because<00:04:10.980> thoughts<00:04:11.610> and<00:04:11.880> emotions<00:04:12.120> are<00:04:12.570> very

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
because thoughts and emotions are very

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.780 
because thoughts and emotions are very
important<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.380> that<00:04:13.470> kind<00:04:13.800> of<00:04:13.890> shifts<00:04:14.340> energy

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
important and that kind of shifts energy

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.490 
important and that kind of shifts energy
and<00:04:14.940> when<00:04:15.060> you<00:04:15.150> want<00:04:15.330> to<00:04:15.420> do<00:04:15.570> is<00:04:15.750> take<00:04:16.290> those

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
and when you want to do is take those

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.890 
and when you want to do is take those
thoughts<00:04:16.950> and<00:04:17.220> emotions<00:04:17.459> and<00:04:17.940> move<00:04:18.209> them<00:04:18.630> into

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
thoughts and emotions and move them into

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.280 
thoughts and emotions and move them into
this<00:04:19.770> other<00:04:20.040> state<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.000> I'm<00:04:21.720> started

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:22.290 
this other state and I'm started

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.110 
this other state and I'm started
learning<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.740> technique<00:04:23.220> of<00:04:23.400> how<00:04:23.460> to<00:04:23.640> do<00:04:23.910> that

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
learning a technique of how to do that

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.880 
learning a technique of how to do that
that<00:04:24.390> brings<00:04:24.690> a<00:04:24.840> lot<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.790> harmony<00:04:26.790> and<00:04:27.890> peace

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
that brings a lot of harmony and peace

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.740 
that brings a lot of harmony and peace
is<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:29.460> most<00:04:29.670> important<00:04:30.180> thing<00:04:30.330> that<00:04:30.360> comes

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
is the most important thing that comes

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.990 
is the most important thing that comes
through<00:04:31.200> and<00:04:31.560> I'm<00:04:31.830> actually<00:04:32.010> seeing<00:04:32.520> that

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
through and I'm actually seeing that

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.020 
through and I'm actually seeing that
it's<00:04:33.450> shifting<00:04:34.020> into<00:04:34.610> another<00:04:35.610> dimension

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
it's shifting into another dimension

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.750 
it's shifting into another dimension
it's<00:04:36.750> like<00:04:36.930> pushing<00:04:37.380> this<00:04:38.010> energy<00:04:38.520> into

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:38.760 
it's like pushing this energy into

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.060 
it's like pushing this energy into
another<00:04:39.000> dimension<00:04:39.710> don't<00:04:40.710> have<00:04:40.890> all<00:04:41.040> that

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:41.070 
another dimension don't have all that

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.800 
another dimension don't have all that
much<00:04:41.250> time<00:04:41.670> I'm<00:04:41.940> just<00:04:42.150> throwing<00:04:42.360> it<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:42.720> I

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
much time I'm just throwing it in I

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.900 
much time I'm just throwing it in I
hadn't<00:04:43.140> even<00:04:43.230> discussed<00:04:43.680> it<00:04:43.860> with<00:04:43.890> Justin<00:04:44.430> so

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:44.910 
hadn't even discussed it with Justin so

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:46.610 
hadn't even discussed it with Justin so
I<00:04:44.940> don't<00:04:45.180> want<00:04:45.300> to<00:04:45.390> take<00:04:45.690> up<00:04:45.720> all<00:04:46.020> our<00:04:46.170> time<00:04:46.200> on

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
I don't want to take up all our time on

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.860 
I don't want to take up all our time on
that<00:04:46.800> but<00:04:47.040> if<00:04:47.190> you<00:04:47.340> have<00:04:47.580> going<00:04:48.570> through

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
that but if you have going through

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.450 
that but if you have going through
something<00:04:49.110> and<00:04:49.470> you<00:04:49.560> just<00:04:49.770> don't<00:04:49.980> know<00:04:50.130> you

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:50.460 
something and you just don't know you

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.430 
something and you just don't know you
know<00:04:50.490> what<00:04:50.790> to<00:04:50.940> do<00:04:51.090> about<00:04:51.240> it<00:04:51.420> and<00:04:51.780> it's<00:04:52.230> got
