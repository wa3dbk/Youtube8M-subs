 Welcome to an unstoppable christmas dot 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.570
 of call the gods were expected with 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.029
 ice you know I was traveling 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.890
 doing a lot of things paperwork but 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.390
 already be back with more information 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.009
 of quality for your three in this 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.280
 I have them here from the kitchen 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.780
 a great topic about carbohydrates 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 that you have to perfect it well is easy 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.980
 every club has truth then we are going to 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.629
 see here in this video how to calculate the 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.820
 amounts for our diet that many 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.230
 they do not really know how to do and so 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.730
 this topic taking advantage so that you 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.399
 strengthen the scales of a diet 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.899
 exact and very specific emphasizing everything 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.370
 that we have seen good you know that no 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.079
 you will build muscle if you do not eat 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.059
 correctly who do I mean this is 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.770
 that if you are not a caloric plus if 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.180
 you eat more energy than you do 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.550
 body needs obviously not 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.830
 will rise in muscle mass and you delay 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.780
 very much the less you eat so much 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.280
 more after falling in love then is a phrase 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.110
 the contraction valence is not what 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.630
 same eat more to gain weight than 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.440
 eat more to gain muscle mass to what 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.880
 I mean with this is that I 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.590
 you can simply eat a lot 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.060
 food and really win the weight 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.410
 but muscle mass if not more than 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.850
 fat thanks to the videos that I'm 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.540
 well unstoppable because after all 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.550
 learned how to count your calories 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.170
 how to get people out of proteins and 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.850
 fats in how civil order there is 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.260
 flexible etcetera title consumes 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.790
 enough to load it into your diet 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.340
 just do not build muscle 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.140
 correctly and all the time that you are 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.610
 in a gym training you can be a 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.780
 little wasted true so all 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.490
 elements correctly 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.230
 instead, seeing it from the other 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.600
 perspective then if you consume 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.430
 carbohydrates more than forget 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.350
 of the study after you simply go to 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.000
 increase more muscle expenses and 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 end then when it's your turn to be stage of 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.479
 definition you'll see what to delay 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.520
 much more to get the body 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.050
 defined that you want to adjust your 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:58.330
 carbohydrate intake can take you 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.950
 few minutes and it can give you a lot 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.690
 time in the future many people 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.610
 eat eat convince really know what 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.100
 amount is right for them and it 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.780
 delay and achieve the objectives this 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.520
 Video validate exactly to get 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.130
 your goals yacht yacht and as data the 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.360
 intense strength exercise like here 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.040
 we train or for some hotel after 

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.620
 use most of their 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.390
 carbohydrates as as fuel as 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.830
 your gasoline and if you do not like firm 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.380
 carbohydrates you will possibly feel 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.230
 more fatigued more tired and motivation 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.550
 you will not lift more weight than normal with 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.680
 what will be done to them before 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.970
 and you will feel a little worn the biggest 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.550
 part of bodybuilders consume 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.440
 approximately 6.2 grams of 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.930
 carbohydrates per kilo per kilo weight 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.820
 or 1.3 grams by weight in pounds but in 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.350
 our kind of training as is the 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:42.940
 resistance for example 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.590
 obviously the athlete is going to need 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.990
 more carbohydrates approximately 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.640
 from 5 to 6 grams per 15 kilos 

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.440
 obviously bodybuilder is going to need 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.790
 much less that is obviously the 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.650
 amount of carbohydrates that you go from 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.300
 consume your diet depends on how you eat 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.280
 you mobilize what your lifestyle 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.380
 do not always have much heavier more 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.640
 strong with more volume more series then 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:03.250
 obviously you need much more 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.110
 carbohydrates to consume a person 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.120
 I spent in the pool sitting down because 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.610
 that 8 hours and another person who is 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.170
 mason or simply is an athlete and you 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.210
 It happens running of the day or soccer player 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.400
 training, obviously, it's a lot 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.690
 more carbohydrates more energy and here you 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.910
 I dedicate the right amount of 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.770
 carbohydrates that you can choose part 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.630
 exactly the right amount like that 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:24.430
 which is preferential firstly already 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:26.830
 we've seen in the video guide that I've 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.930
 shared like this you can see here 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.210
 after finishing this video you 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.070
 they finish with the intention of description 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:33.640
 of the video about how to dry your 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.900
 calories 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.060
 then the first step will be the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.640
 next indicates your total intake of 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:42.190
 calories to gain muscle sets your 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.660
 validity of proteins and fats adds the 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.970
 number of calories you are eating 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.010
 of proteins and fats and then runs this 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.180
 is the number of your total allocation of 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.490
 calories 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.860
 4 fill the rest of your calories with 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.270
 carbohydrates the most practical way to 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.010
 take out your carbohydrate calculation is 

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:58.660
 simply filling the rest with 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.330
 carbohydrates once you have removed 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.400
 your fat protein intake as well 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.930
 in this video then simply the rest 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:06.850
 leave it with carbohydrates and good 

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.560
 stressing if you are less sensitive to 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.330
 insulin or you're less active than another 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.310
 person because obviously he chooses a 

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.170
 low amount of carbohydrates or 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.190
 obviously moderate and if you are a 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.269
 much more active person 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.919
 it's just a person amount of 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:19.870
 carbohydrates soon higher than the 

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:21.160
 person who does not train much and so 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.210
 let's understand much better 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.220
 about that carbohydrate topic 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.210
 what do you think if I share an example 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:26.980
 as I do in every video true 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.590
 then here we go let's see let's 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.830
 use a guy called pepitos I repeat weighs 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:35.200
 180 pounds and trains about 4 times 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.440
 per week for about 60 to 90 minutes 

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.390
 per session 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.970
 training a lot I repeat is consuming 

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.610
 3000 calories since he wants to build 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:45.950
 musculature he needs around 170 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:47.660
 grams of protein per day or 680 

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.940
 calories since each gram of protein 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.770
 It has 4 calories initially the floor 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:53.570
 set your 40 fat consumption by 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:57.760
 percent of your total calories that is from 

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:57.760
 133 grams or 1200 calories 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.610
 at this point it has one thousand 120 calories 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:05.020
 which gives you room for 280 grams of 

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:08.310
 carbohydrates and those are the 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.310
 macros that pepillo will have 

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.820
 607 protein calories plus 900 

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:22.460
 fat calories equal 1,100 280 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.770
 3000 calories calories I needed 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.410
 to gain muscle minus 2 thousand 160 

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.270
 we are going to be thousand 420 calories that 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:32.120
 are the carbohydrates now we divide 

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:33.350
 for 4 thousand 420 that give us three of the 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.460
 five in five grams of hydrates 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.740
 carbon that is what nugget is going to 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:39.260
 consume the calories what are 3,000 

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:42.080
 the macro ones are proteins if 70 grams 

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.400
 fat 100 grams and carbohydrates 32 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:44.810
 55 grams 

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:46.640
 the athletes who train series with 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.650
 force and with a lot of intensity 

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.390
 Carbohydrates need low diets 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.010
 in carbohydrates do not work at all 

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:54.320
 really for athletes with a lot of demand 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:56.570
 that trains heavy with a lot of resistance 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.520
 etcetera , however, if you consume 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.170
 other carbohydrates may stop 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.880
 consume so much protein and that's not 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:04.610
 we want in general just listen 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.530
 to your body if you feel weak that 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.730
 you can not give more of you unmotivated with 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.260
 dream and combative simply because 

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:11.600
 increases carbohydrate intake more 

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.700
 which they may be very very low so 

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.680
 same definition stage remember that 

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:17.750
 it is best to cut yourself with carbohydrates 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:19.130
 high as it were to say it true but 

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.009
 I repeat to place that level of insulin or 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.270
 you are less active 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:24.689
 it simply decreases a little 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:26.099
 carbohydrates of future calculate this 

00:06:24.689 --> 00:06:28.139
 very good your carbohydrates do not 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:30.149
 worry you will not get fat etcetera 

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:32.580
 they train intense heavy heavy so 

00:06:30.149 --> 00:06:34.559
 it is becoming much more active than 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.759
 muscle mass and compensating all 

00:06:34.559 --> 00:06:37.770
 the energy that you are spending on your 

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:39.779
 body more gasoline that is shown life 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:41.759
 this basically guys for the day of 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:44.129
 today I hope you liked this great 

00:06:41.759 --> 00:06:45.300
 video with a very important topic work 

00:06:44.129 --> 00:06:46.559
 of scola references equally of 

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.719
 research so that they can read 

00:06:46.559 --> 00:06:49.710
 In the same way, I welcome you to 

00:06:48.719 --> 00:06:50.939
 this new without utility that is 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.949
 having the two videos that is coming to 

00:06:50.939 --> 00:06:54.569
 continuation here in the kitchen of the yen 

00:06:52.949 --> 00:06:56.339
 unstoppable in new videos and well 

00:06:54.569 --> 00:06:58.110
 Workouts in the gym with new 

00:06:56.339 --> 00:07:00.509
 athletes that will recommend us many 

00:06:58.110 --> 00:07:02.270
 best techniques many better techniques
