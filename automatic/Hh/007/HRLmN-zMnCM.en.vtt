00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
Stampede so here is the stock Stampede

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:24.830 
Stampede so here is the stock Stampede
fire<00:00:12.929> speed<00:00:22.310> that<00:00:23.310> took<00:00:23.640> about<00:00:23.820> maybe<00:00:24.449> 10

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
fire speed that took about maybe 10

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.679 
fire speed that took about maybe 10
seconds<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:25.650> my<00:00:26.070> batteries<00:00:26.640> are<00:00:26.820> worn<00:00:27.359> down

power source you want to make sure you
want<00:00:55.530> to<00:00:55.589> connect<00:00:55.890> them<00:00:56.100> first<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.119> all<00:00:57.180> if<00:00:57.330> you

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
want to connect them first of all if you

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.609 
want to connect them first of all if you
have<00:00:57.510> two<00:00:57.720> of<00:00:57.750> them<00:00:57.900> connect<00:00:58.260> them<00:00:58.409> together

00:00:58.609 --> 00:00:58.619 
have two of them connect them together

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:02.179 
have two of them connect them together
and<00:00:59.449> i<00:01:00.449> will<00:01:00.869> show<00:01:01.049> you<00:01:01.110> how<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.320> do<00:01:01.619> that<00:01:01.799> in<00:01:01.860> a

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:02.189 
and i will show you how to do that in a

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.200 
and i will show you how to do that in a
few<00:01:02.430> minutes<00:01:02.820> if<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.869> do<00:01:04.019> not<00:01:04.140> know<00:01:04.379> how<00:01:04.589> and

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
few minutes if you do not know how and

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.940 
few minutes if you do not know how and
then<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.630> connect<00:01:06.990> them<00:01:07.140> to<00:01:07.440> these<00:01:07.620> two

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
then you connect them to these two

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.880 
then you connect them to these two
alligator<00:01:08.580> clips<00:01:08.970> and<00:01:09.440> just<00:01:10.440> imagine<00:01:10.650> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
alligator clips and just imagine I

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500 
alligator clips and just imagine I
connection<00:01:11.370> because<00:01:11.670> I'm<00:01:11.910> going<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.120> connect

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
connection because I'm going to connect

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.100 
connection because I'm going to connect
them<00:01:12.630> later<00:01:12.900> but<00:01:13.340> um<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:15.120> take<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.720> needle

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
them later but um you take I have needle

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.360 
them later but um you take I have needle
nose<00:01:16.290> pliers<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.160> this<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> why<00:01:18.180> I<00:01:18.240> do<00:01:18.390> I<00:01:19.370> take

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:20.370 
nose pliers and this is why I do I take

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.120 
nose pliers and this is why I do I take
the<00:01:21.050> pliers<00:01:22.050> line<00:01:22.620> them<00:01:22.830> up<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.070> the

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the pliers line them up with the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580 
the pliers line them up with the
alligator<00:01:23.550> clip<00:01:23.850> and<00:01:24.300> then<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.410> squeeze

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
alligator clip and then just squeeze

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.840 
alligator clip and then just squeeze
that<00:01:25.950> so<00:01:26.910> that<00:01:27.150> it<00:01:27.180> opens<00:01:27.660> and<00:01:28.160> if<00:01:29.160> you<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.460> see

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
that so that it opens and if you can see

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.710 
that so that it opens and if you can see
right<00:01:30.380> here<00:01:31.380> at<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:32.909> end<00:01:33.120> there<00:01:33.390> are<00:01:33.480> two

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
right here at the very end there are two

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.110 
right here at the very end there are two
springs<00:01:34.640> which<00:01:36.080> there<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.350> sort<00:01:37.710> of<00:01:37.800> like

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
springs which there you sort of like

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.050 
springs which there you sort of like

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.160 
if you're using 9 volts like I am you
take<00:02:19.620> your<00:02:19.890> 9<00:02:20.190> volt<00:02:20.489> adapter<00:02:21.000> you<00:02:21.480> take<00:02:21.720> one

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
take your 9 volt adapter you take one

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.570 
take your 9 volt adapter you take one
black<00:02:22.560> end<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.480> one<00:02:24.480> red<00:02:25.080> end<00:02:25.349> and<00:02:25.590> you<00:02:26.340> twist

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
black end and one red end and you twist

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.050 
black end and one red end and you twist
these<00:02:26.819> wires<00:02:27.150> together<00:02:27.500> like<00:02:28.500> this<00:02:29.060> alright

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
these wires together like this alright

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.089 
these wires together like this alright
so<00:02:30.239> once<00:02:30.420> these<00:02:30.599> are<00:02:30.660> twisted<00:02:31.349> you<00:02:31.860> should

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099 
so once these are twisted you should

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.080 
so once these are twisted you should
have<00:02:32.370> one<00:02:33.180> open<00:02:33.480> black<00:02:34.019> end<00:02:34.319> and<00:02:34.590> one<00:02:35.099> open<00:02:35.700> red

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
have one open black end and one open red

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
have one open black end and one open red
end<00:02:36.299> and<00:02:37.549> you<00:02:38.549> want<00:02:38.760> to<00:02:38.849> put<00:02:39.060> this<00:02:39.450> red<00:02:39.780> end<00:02:40.019> to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
end and you want to put this red end to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.589 
end and you want to put this red end to
the<00:02:40.799> red<00:02:41.099> alligator<00:02:41.640> clip<00:02:41.940> it<00:02:42.120> doesn't<00:02:42.420> matter

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
the red alligator clip it doesn't matter

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.740 
the red alligator clip it doesn't matter
really<00:02:42.959> I<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:44.099> do<00:02:44.640> that<00:02:44.849> because<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.540> makes

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:45.750 
really I just do that because it makes

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.559 
really I just do that because it makes
it<00:02:46.260> easier<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.830> tell<00:02:47.220> which<00:02:47.610> wires<00:02:47.880> which<00:02:48.269> and

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569 
it easier to tell which wires which and

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:51.229 
it easier to tell which wires which and
then<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.290> take<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.769> black<00:02:50.430> wire<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.970> connect

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
then you take the black wire and connect

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.370 
then you take the black wire and connect
it<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:51.540> the<00:02:51.660> black<00:02:51.959> alligator<00:02:52.349> clip<00:02:54.170> make<00:02:55.170> sure

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380 
it to the black alligator clip make sure

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.470 
it to the black alligator clip make sure
to<00:02:55.530> put<00:02:55.650> some<00:02:55.920> sort<00:02:56.310> of<00:02:56.400> electric<00:02:57.030> tape<00:02:57.299> or

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
to put some sort of electric tape or

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.369 
to put some sort of electric tape or
something<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.590> open<00:02:59.160> wire<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.239> it<00:03:00.660> doesn't

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
something on the open wire so it doesn't

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.380 
something on the open wire so it doesn't
cross<00:03:01.560> any<00:03:01.829> other<00:03:02.010> metal<00:03:02.280> pieces<00:03:02.579> and<00:03:03.000> cause

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
cross any other metal pieces and cause

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.259 
cross any other metal pieces and cause
your<00:03:03.629> battery<00:03:03.989> to<00:03:04.319> short-circuit<00:03:05.060> alright<00:03:06.060> so

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
your battery to short-circuit alright so

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:08.059 
your battery to short-circuit alright so
once<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.569> have<00:03:06.690> the<00:03:06.840> alligator<00:03:07.410> clips<00:03:07.799> and

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
once you have the alligator clips and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.650 
once you have the alligator clips and
your<00:03:08.190> power<00:03:08.340> source<00:03:08.790> all<00:03:09.060> hooked<00:03:09.329> up<00:03:09.510> and

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:09.660 
your power source all hooked up and

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.170 
your power source all hooked up and
everything<00:03:10.170> which<00:03:10.860> be<00:03:11.250> patient<00:03:11.730> doing<00:03:11.910> that

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
everything which be patient doing that

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.059 
everything which be patient doing that
because<00:03:12.420> sometimes<00:03:13.049> it<00:03:13.319> can<00:03:13.500> take<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.739> little

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
because sometimes it can take a little

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:16.460 
because sometimes it can take a little
bit<00:03:14.310> just<00:03:15.030> getting<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.540> alligator<00:03:16.140> clip

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
bit just getting the alligator clip

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.879 
bit just getting the alligator clip
right<00:03:17.160> onto<00:03:17.549> that<00:03:17.670> spring<00:03:18.209> and<00:03:18.769> what<00:03:19.769> I've

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
right onto that spring and what I've

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.770 
right onto that spring and what I've
done<00:03:20.069> is<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> just<00:03:20.459> duct-taped<00:03:20.910> my<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.420> nine

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
done is I just duct-taped my to nine

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.229 
done is I just duct-taped my to nine
volts<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.560> the<00:03:22.920> inside<00:03:23.670> and<00:03:25.850> since<00:03:26.850> I'm

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
volts to the inside and since I'm

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.569 
volts to the inside and since I'm
probably<00:03:27.660> not<00:03:27.930> going<00:03:28.109> to<00:03:28.200> be<00:03:28.260> using<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:29.160> nine

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:29.579 
probably not going to be using just nine

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:32.330 
probably not going to be using just nine
bolts<00:03:30.030> for<00:03:30.209> the<00:03:30.269> finished<00:03:30.690> mod<00:03:30.959> I<00:03:31.319> am<00:03:32.069> not

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
bolts for the finished mod I am not

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:35.449 
bolts for the finished mod I am not
sawing<00:03:33.060> this<00:03:33.420> off<00:03:33.690> because<00:03:33.959> what<00:03:34.920> I<00:03:34.950> may<00:03:35.160> do<00:03:35.220> is

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:35.459 
sawing this off because what I may do is

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:37.940 
sawing this off because what I may do is
take<00:03:35.670> out<00:03:35.849> all<00:03:36.000> these<00:03:36.150> D<00:03:36.420> batteries<00:03:36.660> and<00:03:37.260> take

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 
take out all these D batteries and take

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.949 
take out all these D batteries and take
out<00:03:38.130> the<00:03:38.160> little<00:03:38.639> divider<00:03:39.120> in<00:03:39.389> between<00:03:39.780> them

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
out the little divider in between them

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:43.490 
out the little divider in between them
and<00:03:40.139> hook<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.190> maybe<00:03:41.609> to<00:03:42.209> our<00:03:42.569> C<00:03:42.840> batteries<00:03:43.109> to

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
and hook up maybe to our C batteries to

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.250 
and hook up maybe to our C batteries to
them<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:44.730> for<00:03:45.000> now<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.510> just<00:03:45.780> want<00:03:46.139> to<00:03:46.200> make

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
them but for now I just want to make

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.610 
them but for now I just want to make
this<00:03:46.440> video<00:03:46.620> see<00:03:47.370> how<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.609> works<00:03:47.819> in<00:03:48.090> them<00:03:49.049> so

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
this video see how it works in them so

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.640 
this video see how it works in them so
amusing<00:03:50.010> nine<00:03:50.190> bolts<00:03:50.549> and<00:03:50.790> obviously<00:03:51.650> the

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:52.650 
amusing nine bolts and obviously the

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:54.620 
amusing nine bolts and obviously the
bigger<00:03:52.859> the<00:03:53.040> power<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.609> it's<00:03:54.030> surprising<00:03:54.599> that

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
bigger the power is it's surprising that

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.809 
bigger the power is it's surprising that
the<00:03:54.840> bigger<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.169> power<00:03:55.349> or<00:03:55.680> sorry<00:03:56.489> the<00:03:56.579> bigger

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
the bigger the power or sorry the bigger

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.569 
the bigger the power or sorry the bigger
the<00:03:57.000> battery<00:03:57.389> is<00:03:57.919> it<00:03:58.919> really<00:03:59.220> doesn't<00:03:59.400> have

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
the battery is it really doesn't have

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:02.839 
the battery is it really doesn't have
any<00:03:59.730> more<00:03:59.880> power<00:03:59.940> a<00:04:01.010> 9-volt<00:04:02.010> car<00:04:02.280> battery<00:04:02.609> is

00:04:02.839 --> 00:04:02.849 
any more power a 9-volt car battery is

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:05.509 
any more power a 9-volt car battery is
the<00:04:03.540> same<00:04:03.750> as<00:04:03.959> one<00:04:04.230> of<00:04:04.260> these<00:04:04.500> on<00:04:04.829> nine<00:04:05.250> volt

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
the same as one of these on nine volt

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.240 
the same as one of these on nine volt
batteries<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.750> only<00:04:07.049> thing<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.500> the<00:04:07.919> car

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
batteries the only thing is the car

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.009 
batteries the only thing is the car
battery<00:04:08.700> last<00:04:09.000> longer<00:04:09.269> so<00:04:09.510> the<00:04:09.750> bigger<00:04:09.930> the

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
battery last longer so the bigger the

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:12.400 
battery last longer so the bigger the
batteries<00:04:10.470> are<00:04:10.650> they<00:04:10.919> last<00:04:11.250> a<00:04:11.459> lot<00:04:11.639> longer<00:04:11.700> so

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
batteries are they last a lot longer so

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.559 
batteries are they last a lot longer so
I'm<00:04:13.410> not<00:04:13.530> sure<00:04:13.590> how<00:04:13.739> long<00:04:14.010> these<00:04:14.250> are<00:04:14.459> last<00:04:14.609> but

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
I'm not sure how long these are last but

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.800 
I'm not sure how long these are last but
um<00:04:15.930> these<00:04:16.829> D<00:04:17.220> batteries<00:04:17.459> will<00:04:17.970> definitely

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
um these D batteries will definitely

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:22.790 
um these D batteries will definitely
last<00:04:19.229> longer<00:04:19.829> than<00:04:20.010> these<00:04:20.669> two<00:04:20.910> but<00:04:21.599> it<00:04:22.470> does

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
last longer than these two but it does

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.640 
last longer than these two but it does
have<00:04:23.070> a<00:04:23.099> lot<00:04:24.000> better<00:04:24.210> rate<00:04:24.479> of<00:04:24.630> fire<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.469> did

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
have a lot better rate of fire and I did

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.970 
have a lot better rate of fire and I did
test-fire<00:04:26.130> it<00:04:26.159> before<00:04:26.640> this<00:04:26.990> so

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
test-fire it before this so

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:33.950 
test-fire it before this so
now<00:04:29.520> we<00:04:29.580> are<00:04:30.030> going<00:04:30.060> to<00:04:30.570> test<00:04:31.350> it<00:04:31.560> out<00:04:32.780> this<00:04:33.780> is

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
now we are going to test it out this is

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.880 
now we are going to test it out this is
loaded<00:04:34.200> with<00:04:34.350> 18<00:04:35.250> streamlines<00:04:36.650> lick<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.770> on

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
loaded with 18 streamlines lick it on

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.300 
loaded with 18 streamlines lick it on
make<00:04:38.370> sure<00:04:38.400> that's<00:04:38.760> shut<00:04:39.060> and<00:04:39.960> for<00:04:40.950> one<00:04:41.100> thing

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
make sure that's shut and for one thing

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.230 
make sure that's shut and for one thing
this<00:04:41.400> is<00:04:41.550> a<00:04:41.580> lot<00:04:41.910> lighter<00:04:42.180> now<00:04:42.500> this<00:04:43.500> is<00:04:43.770> the

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
this is a lot lighter now this is the

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.630 
this is a lot lighter now this is the
Stampede<00:04:45.240> with<00:04:45.990> the<00:04:46.260> 29<00:04:46.770> bolts<00:04:47.130> hooked<00:04:47.310> up<00:04:47.460> to

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
Stampede with the 29 bolts hooked up to

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:55.610 
Stampede with the 29 bolts hooked up to
it<00:04:51.770> and<00:04:52.770> it's<00:04:53.130> empty<00:04:53.810> so<00:04:54.810> that<00:04:55.290> was<00:04:55.410> probably

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
it and it's empty so that was probably

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.710 
it and it's empty so that was probably
maybe<00:04:57.740> 5-6<00:04:58.740> seconds<00:04:59.160> something<00:04:59.610> like<00:04:59.790> that<00:05:00.030> so

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
maybe 5-6 seconds something like that so

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:05.300 
maybe 5-6 seconds something like that so
it<00:05:01.080> is<00:05:01.110> a<00:05:01.590> lot<00:05:02.370> quicker<00:05:02.700> it<00:05:03.090> is<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.990> lot<00:05:04.950> lighter

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
it is a lot quicker it is a lot lighter

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.290 
it is a lot quicker it is a lot lighter
and<00:05:05.720> I'm<00:05:06.720> not<00:05:07.530> sure<00:05:07.770> if<00:05:07.830> this<00:05:07.980> is<00:05:08.040> just<00:05:08.400> me<00:05:08.580> but

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
and I'm not sure if this is just me but

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.750 
and I'm not sure if this is just me but
the<00:05:09.510> darts<00:05:09.900> I<00:05:10.080> shot<00:05:10.380> seem<00:05:11.070> to<00:05:11.220> be<00:05:11.340> hanging<00:05:11.700> the

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:11.760 
the darts I shot seem to be hanging the

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.950 
the darts I shot seem to be hanging the
wall<00:05:11.940> a<00:05:12.180> lot<00:05:12.510> harder<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.580> so<00:05:14.580> for<00:05:15.090> my<00:05:15.330> finished

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
wall a lot harder and so for my finished

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.850 
wall a lot harder and so for my finished
mod<00:05:16.230> what<00:05:17.130> I<00:05:17.160> will<00:05:17.400> most<00:05:17.610> likely<00:05:17.940> be<00:05:18.150> doing<00:05:18.630> is

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
mod what I will most likely be doing is

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.410 
mod what I will most likely be doing is
I<00:05:19.860> probably<00:05:20.130> won't<00:05:20.370> keep<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.760> like<00:05:20.910> this<00:05:20.940> i

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.420 
I probably won't keep it like this i

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:25.670 
I probably won't keep it like this i
will<00:05:22.850> replace<00:05:23.850> the<00:05:24.030> batteries<00:05:24.420> maybe<00:05:24.810> put<00:05:25.410> our

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
will replace the batteries maybe put our

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.370 
will replace the batteries maybe put our
C<00:05:25.950> batteries<00:05:26.160> in<00:05:26.550> it<00:05:26.640> um<00:05:26.990> probably<00:05:27.990> give<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.290> a

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
C batteries in it um probably give it a

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:33.050 
C batteries in it um probably give it a
paint<00:05:28.560> job<00:05:28.710> and<00:05:30.380> probably<00:05:31.380> a<00:05:31.650> few<00:05:31.770> mods<00:05:32.640> like

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
paint job and probably a few mods like

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.540 
paint job and probably a few mods like
taking<00:05:33.540> the<00:05:33.660> air<00:05:33.810> restrictors<00:05:34.380> out<00:05:34.590> I<00:05:34.890> really

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:35.550 
taking the air restrictors out I really

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.820 
taking the air restrictors out I really
haven't<00:05:35.700> opened<00:05:36.060> up<00:05:36.120> this<00:05:36.240> blaster<00:05:36.750> yet<00:05:36.930> but

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:37.830 
haven't opened up this blaster yet but

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:40.480 
haven't opened up this blaster yet but
um<00:05:38.070> probably<00:05:39.060> take<00:05:39.390> the<00:05:39.510> air<00:05:39.660> restrictor<00:05:40.200> out

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
um probably take the air restrictor out

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:45.290 
um probably take the air restrictor out
maybe<00:05:41.490> replace<00:05:42.120> this<00:05:42.420> ring<00:05:42.750> and<00:05:43.340> so<00:05:44.340> yeah<00:05:44.790> that

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
maybe replace this ring and so yeah that
