bring the yarn through you're going to
chain<00:01:14.210> two<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.539> now<00:01:16.409> I'm<00:01:16.530> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.890> evenly

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
chain two and now I'm going to evenly

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.149 
chain two and now I'm going to evenly
double<00:01:17.789> crochet<00:01:18.210> all<00:01:18.570> the<00:01:18.630> way<00:01:19.020> around<00:01:19.470> the

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
double crochet all the way around the

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
double crochet all the way around the
opening<00:01:20.670> of<00:01:21.149> the<00:01:21.450> slipper

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
opening of the slipper

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.270 
opening of the slipper
so<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.770> evenly<00:01:23.310> double<00:01:23.789> crochet<00:01:24.270> around

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
so to evenly double crochet around

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.309 
so to evenly double crochet around
simply<00:01:26.280> means<00:01:26.550> that<00:01:27.060> you<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.300> start<00:01:28.110> making

00:01:28.309 --> 00:01:28.319 
simply means that you just start making

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:31.730 
simply means that you just start making
double<00:01:28.890> crochets<00:01:29.399> and<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:30.509> try<00:01:30.810> to<00:01:30.840> keep<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
double crochets and you try to keep the

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:40.550 
double crochets and you try to keep the
work<00:01:31.950> from<00:01:32.909> either<00:01:33.210> buckling<00:01:33.929> or<00:01:34.429> rippling

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.440 

so<00:01:41.100> that<00:01:41.250> means<00:01:41.520> that<00:01:41.850> as<00:01:42.180> you're<00:01:42.420> working

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
so that means that as you're working

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.140 
so that means that as you're working
your<00:01:43.110> work<00:01:43.710> is<00:01:43.920> going<00:01:44.190> to<00:01:44.280> be<00:01:44.400> about<00:01:44.760> the<00:01:44.940> same

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:45.150 
your work is going to be about the same

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.290 
your work is going to be about the same
size<00:01:45.210> as<00:01:46.160> your<00:01:47.160> foundation<00:01:47.400> that<00:01:48.150> you're

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:48.300 
size as your foundation that you're

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.080 
size as your foundation that you're
working<00:01:48.480> on<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:50.040> I'm<00:01:50.160> just<00:01:50.220> going<00:01:50.580> to<00:01:50.760> go<00:01:50.940> ahead

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
working on so I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.410 
working on so I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:01:51.960> I'm<00:01:52.080> going<00:01:52.290> to<00:01:52.350> double<00:01:52.740> crochet<00:01:53.420> evenly

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
and I'm going to double crochet evenly

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:02.590 
and I'm going to double crochet evenly
all<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:54.960> way<00:01:55.560> around<00:01:56.550> the<00:01:57.000> opening<00:01:57.570> of<00:01:57.810> this

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600
