00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 The day is coming to an end here 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.359
 Yes, that's how fast it goes 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:08.970
 sunday is over and it has that 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.219
 Snowed here all day in moderate 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.719
 intensity with a bit of winter 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.490
 between it always comes to a gust 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.800
 but you do not notice it 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.720
 that the snowfall is so fine i know 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.460
 Not at all, but if you look 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.029
 look at the streetlights or on 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.609
 the trees 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.260
 there is already a lot we liked 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.949
 now here at spitzingsee already 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.539
 30 inches and it continues to snow 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.210
 let's look briefly times the 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.120
 precipitation map on for morgan and 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.489
 that would mean on our position 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 Here Spitzingsee is also a drawn 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:46.950
 with the red needle again 20 cm and 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.110
 that would be 30 and 20 in total 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.079
 50 as half a meter would be that 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.420
 let's see if that happens and more 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.660
 the snowfall limit continues to fall 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.730
 So in the second half of the night is the 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.879
 snowfall boundary up to partial lay 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.890
 so that it sinks also in the Munich area 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:07.770
 a white surprise tomorrow morning 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.610
 could give or even the 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.340
 roads 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 damn smooth could be because now 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.909
 Rain has fallen, it is called frost 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.630
 means to be careful early on the way to 

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:22.320
 job 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.939
 it could still be chute but me 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:26.100
 I do not want to dismiss you in the evening 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:28.680
 without saying it next week or 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.409
 the next week will be better 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.200
 spring takes a new start and 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.090
 the temperatures could start on wednesday 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.479
 we hope to go uphill again 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.829
 that and for all providers enjoys this 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.070
 landscape and the pictures 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.920
 because soon it is finally over 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.810

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:52.220
