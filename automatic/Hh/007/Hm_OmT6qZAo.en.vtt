a good shot up here some to work ahead
go<00:01:13.450> outside<00:01:13.720> the<00:01:13.840> cases<00:01:16.320> hard<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.530> make<00:01:17.650> this<00:01:17.800> -

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
go outside the cases hard to make this -

go outside the cases hard to make this -
giggling<00:01:20.580> okay

giggling okay
here<00:01:22.060> we<00:01:22.240> go<00:01:22.360> right<00:01:22.540> there<00:01:23.020> here<00:01:23.470> you<00:01:23.590> can<00:01:23.710> see

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
here we go right there here you can see

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.960 
here we go right there here you can see
transoms<00:01:26.020> in<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.290> little<00:01:26.470> bit

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.170 

or<00:01:30.450> they<00:01:30.690> hit<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.640> machine<00:01:32.640> out<00:01:32.760> some<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.120> the

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
or they hit a machine out some of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.390 
or they hit a machine out some of the
cases<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.630> little<00:01:33.810> bit<00:01:34.130> clearance<00:01:35.130> for<00:01:35.340> the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
cases a little bit clearance for the

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.940 
cases a little bit clearance for the
rods<00:01:36.050> because<00:01:37.050> there's<00:01:37.230> more<00:01:37.440> stroke<00:01:37.770> on

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
rods because there's more stroke on

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.970 
rods because there's more stroke on
these<00:01:38.330> they<00:01:39.330> had<00:01:39.540> to<00:01:39.660> do<00:01:39.750> this<00:01:39.900> on<00:01:40.080> both<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.890> the

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:40.980 
these they had to do this on both of the

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.820 
these they had to do this on both of the
sim<00:01:41.250> book<00:01:41.760> the<00:01:41.910> case<00:01:42.060> wall<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.480> back<00:01:42.570> or<00:01:42.780> here

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.620 

so<00:01:46.830> that<00:01:46.980> means<00:01:47.190> because<00:01:47.520> some<00:01:47.760> resistant

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
so that means because some resistant

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
so that means because some resistant
they<00:01:48.690> get<00:01:48.810> some<00:01:48.930> extra<00:01:49.200> movement<00:01:53.090> for<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:54.180> raw

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
they get some extra movement for the raw

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:13.130 
they get some extra movement for the raw
to<00:01:54.420> come<00:01:54.780> three

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.380 

anytime<00:02:14.140> you<00:02:14.379> start<00:02:14.910> going<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.120> heavy

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
anytime you start going to heavy

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.350 
anytime you start going to heavy
modifications<00:02:17.319> like<00:02:17.519> strokers<00:02:18.519> or<00:02:18.849> big<00:02:19.090> bores

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
modifications like strokers or big bores

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.470 
modifications like strokers or big bores
or<00:02:19.569> whatever<00:02:20.280> there<00:02:21.280> will<00:02:21.550> be<00:02:21.580> modifications

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
or whatever there will be modifications

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.540 
or whatever there will be modifications
such<00:02:22.629> as<00:02:22.810> this<00:02:23.019> of<00:02:23.280> some<00:02:24.280> kind<00:02:26.160> this<00:02:27.160> something

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
such as this of some kind this something

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:36.320 
such as this of some kind this something
you<00:02:27.610> had<00:02:27.700> to<00:02:27.790> expect

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.590 

okay<00:02:36.870> now<00:02:37.260> here<00:02:37.560> we<00:02:37.590> have<00:02:37.980> on<00:02:38.340> the<00:02:38.400> left<00:02:39.360> side

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
okay now here we have on the left side

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.860 
okay now here we have on the left side
the<00:02:40.080> new<00:02:40.260> SMS<00:02:40.890> piston<00:02:41.430> from<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.670> kit<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.120> on

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the new SMS piston from the kit and on

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.300 
the new SMS piston from the kit and on
the<00:02:43.020> right<00:02:43.610> stock<00:02:44.610> piston<00:02:45.860> right<00:02:46.860> away<00:02:47.130> you

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the right stock piston right away you

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.680 
the right stock piston right away you
can<00:02:47.400> start<00:02:47.640> seeing<00:02:47.910> multitude<00:02:48.600> of

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
can start seeing multitude of

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.820 
can start seeing multitude of
differences<00:02:50.420> mainly<00:02:51.420> look<00:02:51.780> right<00:02:51.990> here<00:02:52.230> at

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
differences mainly look right here at

00:02:52.830 --> 00:03:09.200 
differences mainly look right here at
the<00:02:53.010> wrist<00:02:53.190> pan<00:02:53.520> hole<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.060> this<00:02:54.930> one<00:02:55.110> here

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
you can just tell this by looking at

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.870 
you can just tell this by looking at
that<00:03:11.660> that<00:03:12.710> there's<00:03:13.710> a<00:03:13.860> big<00:03:14.220> difference<00:03:14.730> in

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
that that there's a big difference in

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.620 
that that there's a big difference in
the<00:03:14.970> stroke

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
the stroke

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.890 
the stroke
these<00:03:16.230> are<00:03:16.380> stroker<00:03:16.800> Pistons<00:03:17.250> over<00:03:17.430> here<00:03:17.900> in

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
these are stroker Pistons over here in

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.090 
these are stroker Pistons over here in
order<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.230> keep<00:03:19.320> their<00:03:19.530> risk<00:03:19.770> pin<00:03:20.010> in<00:03:20.160> place

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
order to keep their risk pin in place

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.260 
order to keep their risk pin in place
they<00:03:23.100> have<00:03:23.190> a<00:03:23.250> little<00:03:23.430> button<00:03:23.820> right<00:03:23.850> here<00:03:24.030> it

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:24.270 
they have a little button right here it

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:31.660 
they have a little button right here it
goes<00:03:24.660> on<00:03:24.900> in
