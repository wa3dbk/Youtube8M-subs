00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:40.670 
originally when I got this home from the

originally when I got this home from the
post<00:00:40.850> office<00:00:42.250> the<00:00:43.250> pivot<00:00:43.940> screw<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.239> didn't

notice<00:00:45.170> this<00:00:45.290> and<00:00:45.470> this<00:00:45.530> is<00:00:45.680> actually<00:00:45.800> what

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
notice this and this is actually what

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:49.810 
notice this and this is actually what
has<00:00:47.440> basically<00:00:48.440> caused<00:00:48.800> the<00:00:49.100> poor<00:00:49.340> lock<00:00:49.610> up

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:49.820 
has basically caused the poor lock up

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.690 
has basically caused the poor lock up
that<00:00:49.850> I<00:00:50.030> experienced<00:00:50.809> with<00:00:50.899> it<00:00:51.079> I<00:00:52.040> didn't

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
that I experienced with it I didn't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.240 
that I experienced with it I didn't
really<00:00:52.910> say<00:00:53.239> that<00:00:53.270> in<00:00:53.540> the<00:00:53.630> video<00:00:53.750> but<00:00:54.559> it<00:00:54.620> did

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:55.250 
really say that in the video but it did

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.780 
really say that in the video but it did
have<00:00:55.430> quite<00:00:55.610> a<00:00:55.700> bit<00:00:55.790> of<00:00:55.910> play<00:00:56.300> in<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.540> walk<00:00:56.809> up

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:57.790 
have quite a bit of play in the walk up

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.190 
have quite a bit of play in the walk up
but<00:00:58.790> I<00:00:58.820> noticed<00:00:59.210> last<00:00:59.360> night<00:00:59.540> that<00:00:59.660> the<00:00:59.930> pivot

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
but I noticed last night that the pivot

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.959 
but I noticed last night that the pivot
screw<00:01:00.320> is<00:01:00.559> almost<00:01:00.800> entirely<00:01:01.190> driven<00:01:01.520> out<00:01:01.790> so

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
screw is almost entirely driven out so

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.959 
screw is almost entirely driven out so
this<00:01:02.090> morning<00:01:02.480> actually<00:01:02.660> took<00:01:02.989> my<00:01:03.519> t8<00:01:04.519> driver

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.449 
this morning actually took my t8 driver
and<00:01:05.390> just<00:01:05.600> drove<00:01:06.259> it<00:01:06.380> back<00:01:06.409> in<00:01:06.799> and<00:01:07.039> that's

00:01:07.449 --> 00:01:07.459 
and just drove it back in and that's

00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:09.520 
and just drove it back in and that's
actually<00:01:07.670> fixed<00:01:08.149> up<00:01:08.270> the<00:01:08.389> lock<00:01:08.569> up<00:01:08.810> it's<00:01:09.289> a<00:01:09.380> lot

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:09.530 
actually fixed up the lock up it's a lot

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.349 
actually fixed up the lock up it's a lot
better<00:01:09.679> now<00:01:09.920> the<00:01:10.280> other<00:01:10.369> thing<00:01:10.609> that<00:01:10.639> I<00:01:10.939> really

00:01:11.349 --> 00:01:11.359 
better now the other thing that I really

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:14.080 
better now the other thing that I really
have<00:01:12.079> had<00:01:12.530> a<00:01:12.560> hard<00:01:13.039> time<00:01:13.100> dealing<00:01:13.549> with<00:01:13.729> is

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
have had a hard time dealing with is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.719 
have had a hard time dealing with is
this<00:01:14.380> imperfect<00:01:15.380> grind<00:01:15.770> line<00:01:16.039> and<00:01:16.340> I<00:01:16.549> think

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
this imperfect grind line and I think

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.679 
this imperfect grind line and I think
you<00:01:16.789> can<00:01:16.969> see<00:01:17.119> it<00:01:17.209> right<00:01:17.329> there<00:01:17.389> in<00:01:18.049> the<00:01:18.109> video

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
you can see it right there in the video

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.870 
you can see it right there in the video
maybe<00:01:20.689> yeah<00:01:21.439> you<00:01:21.740> see<00:01:21.889> that<00:01:22.009> little<00:01:22.130> wine<00:01:22.399> that

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
maybe yeah you see that little wine that

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.929 
maybe yeah you see that little wine that
one's<00:01:23.229> there<00:01:24.229> ish<00:01:24.380> that's<00:01:25.279> that's<00:01:25.729> the

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
one's there ish that's that's the

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:28.599 
one's there ish that's that's the
problem<00:01:26.179> and<00:01:26.600> I<00:01:27.439> might<00:01:27.889> end<00:01:28.039> up<00:01:28.130> sending<00:01:28.399> this

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:28.609

Sierra<00:01:49.159> alpha<00:01:49.429> or<00:01:49.789> something<00:01:50.060> like<00:01:50.149> that<00:01:50.209> say

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
Sierra alpha or something like that say

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.589 
Sierra alpha or something like that say
that<00:01:50.779> the<00:01:51.200> spyderco<00:01:51.999> deployment<00:01:52.999> hole<00:01:53.149> or<00:01:53.450> the

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:53.599 
that the spyderco deployment hole or the

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:55.149 
that the spyderco deployment hole or the
benchmade<00:01:54.049> deploy<00:01:54.349> nawl<00:01:54.619> i<00:01:54.649> guess<00:01:54.919> in<00:01:55.069> this

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
benchmade deploy nawl i guess in this

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.519 
benchmade deploy nawl i guess in this
case<00:01:55.219> is<00:01:55.639> an<00:01:56.299> inappropriate<00:01:57.020> method<00:01:57.380> for

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:57.529 
case is an inappropriate method for

00:01:57.529 --> 00:02:02.440 
case is an inappropriate method for
opening<00:01:58.599> for<00:01:59.599> a<00:02:00.399> tactical<00:02:01.399> knife<00:02:01.579> and<00:02:01.880> for<00:02:02.329> me

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
opening for a tactical knife and for me

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.739 
opening for a tactical knife and for me
honestly<00:02:03.369> the<00:02:04.369> whole<00:02:04.669> concept<00:02:05.090> of<00:02:05.209> a<00:02:05.329> tactical

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:05.749 
honestly the whole concept of a tactical

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:07.209 
honestly the whole concept of a tactical
knife<00:02:05.899> and<00:02:06.139> I<00:02:06.259> guess<00:02:06.469> this<00:02:06.649> is<00:02:06.770> sort<00:02:07.069> of<00:02:07.099> a

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:07.219 
knife and I guess this is sort of a

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:09.729 
knife and I guess this is sort of a
philosophy<00:02:07.909> for<00:02:08.479> me<00:02:08.660> but<00:02:08.929> I'm<00:02:09.380> not<00:02:09.619> really

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:09.739 
philosophy for me but I'm not really

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:11.560 
philosophy for me but I'm not really
huge<00:02:10.130> into<00:02:10.369> the<00:02:10.489> whole<00:02:10.640> concept<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.300> knife

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
huge into the whole concept of knife

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.070 
huge into the whole concept of knife
fighting<00:02:12.880> for<00:02:13.880> me<00:02:14.000> I<00:02:14.030> actually<00:02:14.270> carry<00:02:14.690> this

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
fighting for me I actually carry this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.430 
fighting for me I actually carry this
particular<00:02:15.560> knife<00:02:15.710> as<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> utility

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
particular knife as a utility

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:18.260 
particular knife as a utility
blade<00:02:16.620> and<00:02:17.040> I<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> lot<00:02:17.940> of<00:02:17.970> guys<00:02:18.150> would

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
blade and I think a lot of guys would

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:19.190 
blade and I think a lot of guys would
think<00:02:18.480> I'm<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> little<00:02:18.720> bit<00:02:18.900> weird<00:02:19.110> for

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
think I'm a little bit weird for

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.930 
think I'm a little bit weird for
carrying<00:02:19.620> a<00:02:19.650> four-inch<00:02:19.980> blade<00:02:20.370> pretty<00:02:20.790> much

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
carrying a four-inch blade pretty much

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.920 
carrying a four-inch blade pretty much
as<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.960> utility<00:02:22.380> knife<00:02:22.650> but<00:02:23.130> I<00:02:23.660> really<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.780> the

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
as a utility knife but I really like the

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.530 
as a utility knife but I really like the
blade<00:02:25.320> shape<00:02:25.500> of<00:02:25.710> the<00:02:25.860> day<00:02:26.040> f<00:02:26.160> ck<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:27.390> I'm

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
blade shape of the day f ck if I'm

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.030 
blade shape of the day f ck if I'm
really<00:02:27.780> going<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.990> look<00:02:28.170> for<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> tactical

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
really going to look for a tactical

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.250 
really going to look for a tactical
knife<00:02:29.330> that<00:02:30.330> I'm<00:02:30.480> going<00:02:30.600> to<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.870> carrying<00:02:31.170> into

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
knife that I'm going to be carrying into

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.630 
knife that I'm going to be carrying into
combat<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.800> probably<00:02:32.040> got<00:02:32.190> to<00:02:32.280> go<00:02:32.430> with

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
combat and probably got to go with

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.170 
combat and probably got to go with
something<00:02:32.820> more<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.420> an<00:02:33.660> automatic<00:02:34.380> or<00:02:35.180> you

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
something more like an automatic or you

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.300 
something more like an automatic or you
know<00:02:36.270> even<00:02:36.300> a<00:02:36.570> flipper<00:02:36.900> I'm<00:02:37.440> more<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:37.980> a<00:02:38.100> fan<00:02:38.280> of

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
know even a flipper I'm more of a fan of

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.700 
know even a flipper I'm more of a fan of
flippers<00:02:38.760> for<00:02:39.030> if<00:02:39.600> you<00:02:39.780> really<00:02:40.140> really<00:02:40.590> need

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
flippers for if you really really need

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:43.820 
flippers for if you really really need
to<00:02:40.890> use<00:02:41.040> a<00:02:41.070> pocket<00:02:41.460> knife<00:02:41.490> for<00:02:41.820> fighting<00:02:42.830> you

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
to use a pocket knife for fighting you

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.010 
to use a pocket knife for fighting you
know<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.000> understand<00:02:45.000> where<00:02:45.150> the<00:02:45.270> somebody

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
know I understand where the somebody

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.180 
know I understand where the somebody
might<00:02:46.230> be<00:02:46.260> a<00:02:46.380> little<00:02:46.530> bit<00:02:46.680> concerned<00:02:46.830> about

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
might be a little bit concerned about

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.420 
might be a little bit concerned about
using<00:02:47.580> a<00:02:47.640> thumb<00:02:48.120> opening<00:02:48.540> hole<00:02:49.100> with<00:02:50.100> gloves

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
using a thumb opening hole with gloves

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.670 
using a thumb opening hole with gloves
but<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.300> me<00:02:51.420> honestly<00:02:51.810> it's<00:02:52.380> not<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.530> big

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
but for me honestly it's not a big

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.430 
but for me honestly it's not a big
problem<00:02:53.270> you<00:02:54.270> know<00:02:54.390> there's<00:02:54.990> also<00:02:55.140> other

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
problem you know there's also other

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.830 
problem you know there's also other
things<00:02:55.560> that<00:02:55.830> you<00:02:55.920> can<00:02:56.040> do<00:02:56.190> to<00:02:56.340> help<00:02:56.840> assist

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
things that you can do to help assist

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.020 
things that you can do to help assist
these<00:02:58.080> I've<00:02:58.620> seen<00:02:58.830> guys<00:02:58.980> actually<00:02:59.250> take<00:02:59.580> you

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
these I've seen guys actually take you

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.780 
these I've seen guys actually take you
know<00:03:00.810> pieces<00:03:01.170> of<00:03:01.320> tubing<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.950> put<00:03:02.550> them<00:03:02.640> into

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
know pieces of tubing and put them into

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.190 
know pieces of tubing and put them into
there<00:03:03.000> and<00:03:03.030> grind<00:03:03.420> them<00:03:03.570> off<00:03:03.780> and<00:03:03.960> actually

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200 
there and grind them off and actually

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.800 
there and grind them off and actually
create<00:03:04.500> sort<00:03:04.920> of<00:03:04.980> a<00:03:05.070> giant<00:03:05.370> thumb<00:03:05.520> stud<00:03:05.810> but

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
create sort of a giant thumb stud but

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.210 
create sort of a giant thumb stud but
for<00:03:06.990> me<00:03:07.080> honestly<00:03:07.380> I<00:03:07.650> don't<00:03:07.800> really<00:03:07.950> have<00:03:08.130> a

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
for me honestly I don't really have a

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:09.860 
for me honestly I don't really have a
problem<00:03:08.460> with<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:08.790> obviously<00:03:09.480> because<00:03:09.600> I

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
problem with it obviously because I

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.310 
problem with it obviously because I
carry<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:11.480> one<00:03:12.480> of<00:03:12.600> the<00:03:12.720> things<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.020> want<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> say

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
carry it one of the things I want to say

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.050 
carry it one of the things I want to say
real<00:03:13.650> quick<00:03:13.680> before<00:03:13.950> going<00:03:14.340> here<00:03:14.670> is<00:03:14.820> this

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
real quick before going here is this

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
real quick before going here is this
handle<00:03:15.510> is<00:03:16.350> slightly<00:03:16.800> imperfect<00:03:17.160> in<00:03:17.550> a<00:03:17.640> way

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:18.080 
handle is slightly imperfect in a way

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.410 
handle is slightly imperfect in a way
I'm<00:03:19.080> really<00:03:19.680> not<00:03:19.800> a<00:03:19.860> fan<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.250> this<00:03:20.370> texture<00:03:20.820> and

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
I'm really not a fan of this texture and

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.360 
I'm really not a fan of this texture and
I<00:03:21.480> haven't<00:03:21.750> been<00:03:21.930> on<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.200> t<00:03:22.350> sack<00:03:22.650> I<00:03:22.890> don't

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.340 
know if I I don't actually have a video
on<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.560> t<00:03:25.739> sec<00:03:25.950> but<00:03:26.250> I'll<00:03:26.910> have<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.150> do<00:03:27.330> one<00:03:27.510> on

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
on the t sec but I'll have to do one on

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.090 
on the t sec but I'll have to do one on
the<00:03:28.620> 806<00:03:29.160> or<00:03:29.580> the<00:03:29.820> 805<00:03:30.209> 1101<00:03:30.630> but<00:03:31.440> the<00:03:31.530> 806<00:03:31.890> has

the 806 or the 805 1101 but the 806 has

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.120 
the 806 or the 805 1101 but the 806 has
got<00:03:32.250> the<00:03:32.340> same<00:03:32.550> texture<00:03:33.380> just<00:03:34.380> not<00:03:34.650> a<00:03:34.680> huge<00:03:34.950> fan

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
got the same texture just not a huge fan

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.740 
got the same texture just not a huge fan
of<00:03:35.190> this<00:03:35.370> texture<00:03:35.790> it's<00:03:35.940> not<00:03:36.120> very<00:03:36.239> grippy<00:03:36.660> at

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
of this texture it's not very grippy at

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.440 
of this texture it's not very grippy at
all<00:03:36.959> in<00:03:37.680> fact<00:03:37.739> it's<00:03:38.160> kind<00:03:38.370> of<00:03:38.430> slick<00:03:38.700> and<00:03:39.239> when

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:39.450 
all in fact it's kind of slick and when

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.670 
all in fact it's kind of slick and when
you<00:03:39.510> have<00:03:39.630> it<00:03:39.750> in<00:03:39.810> your<00:03:39.870> pocket<00:03:40.050> it's<00:03:40.410> hard<00:03:40.590> to

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
you have it in your pocket it's hard to

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.710 
you have it in your pocket it's hard to
get<00:03:40.800> ahold<00:03:40.920> of<00:03:41.100> and<00:03:41.489> honestly<00:03:42.270> your<00:03:42.450> hand<00:03:42.630> just

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:42.720 
get ahold of and honestly your hand just

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.140 
get ahold of and honestly your hand just
slides<00:03:43.200> right<00:03:43.380> off<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.680> it<00:03:43.950> the<00:03:44.489> handles<00:03:44.820> in<00:03:45.000> a

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
slides right off of it the handles in a

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.699 
slides right off of it the handles in a
nice<00:03:45.360> shape<00:03:45.390> otherwise<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.230> wouldn't<00:03:46.470> really

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
nice shape otherwise I wouldn't really

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.220 
nice shape otherwise I wouldn't really
be<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:47.040> fan<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.820> entire<00:03:48.060> grip<00:03:48.360> on<00:03:48.600> but<00:03:49.110> the

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
be a fan of the entire grip on but the

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.990 
be a fan of the entire grip on but the
handles<00:03:49.560> are<00:03:49.680> good<00:03:49.800> shape<00:03:50.040> so<00:03:50.340> at<00:03:50.850> least

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
handles are good shape so at least

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.340 
handles are good shape so at least
there's<00:03:51.269> that<00:03:51.330> and<00:03:51.750> you<00:03:51.810> do<00:03:51.930> have<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.140> good

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
there's that and you do have this good

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.590 
there's that and you do have this good
finger<00:03:52.620> choil<00:03:52.830> that's<00:03:53.250> part<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.550> the<00:03:53.640> AF<00:03:53.880> AF<00:03:54.060> CK

finger choil that's part of the AF AF CK
design<00:03:55.610> but<00:03:56.610> for<00:03:56.790> me<00:03:56.880> I'm<00:03:57.180> not<00:03:57.209> each<00:03:57.600> fan<00:03:57.780> of

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
design but for me I'm not each fan of

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.080 
design but for me I'm not each fan of
the<00:03:57.930> texture<00:03:58.320> I<00:03:58.500> wish<00:03:59.040> Roger<00:03:59.310> had<00:03:59.670> gone<00:03:59.880> with

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
the texture I wish Roger had gone with

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.670 
the texture I wish Roger had gone with
something<00:04:00.150> a<00:04:00.480> little<00:04:00.570> more<00:04:00.690> along<00:04:01.440> the<00:04:01.470> lines

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
something a little more along the lines

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.040 
something a little more along the lines
of<00:04:01.830> a<00:04:01.950> you<00:04:02.790> know<00:04:02.910> coarse<00:04:03.239> texture<00:04:03.600> maybe<00:04:03.870> like

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
of a you know coarse texture maybe like

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:06.110 
of a you know coarse texture maybe like
an<00:04:04.170> emerson<00:04:04.610> that's<00:04:05.610> going<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:05.940> be<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.060> only

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:06.120 
an emerson that's going to be the only

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.540 
an emerson that's going to be the only
time<00:04:06.330> I'm<00:04:06.840> gonna<00:04:07.050> praise<00:04:07.530> Emerson<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.160> on<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
time I'm gonna praise Emerson is on the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.000 
time I'm gonna praise Emerson is on the
texturing<00:04:09.410> safer<00:04:10.410> when<00:04:10.650> they<00:04:10.769> put<00:04:10.920> the

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
texturing safer when they put the

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.229 
texturing safer when they put the
texture<00:04:11.340> underneath<00:04:11.400> her<00:04:11.670> pocket<00:04:12.060> clips

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
texture underneath her pocket clips

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:15.199 
texture underneath her pocket clips
which<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.540> kind<00:04:12.720> of<00:04:12.780> annoying<00:04:14.150> you<00:04:15.150> know

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
which is kind of annoying you know

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.190 
which is kind of annoying you know
beyond<00:04:15.540> that<00:04:15.690> it's<00:04:15.840> a<00:04:15.900> good<00:04:16.019> knife

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:16.200 
beyond that it's a good knife

beyond that it's a good knife

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
humidity and blade is not rusted at all

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.909

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
that again I think m390 was a great

that again I think m390 was a great
choice

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
choice

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.900 
choice
on<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.560> steel<00:04:29.800> I<00:04:30.280> think<00:04:30.580> it<00:04:30.670> could<00:04:30.820> probably

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
on the steel I think it could probably

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.020 
on the steel I think it could probably
yeah<00:04:31.510> there<00:04:31.690> you<00:04:31.780> go<00:04:31.840> your<00:04:32.800> markings<00:04:33.760> and<00:04:33.880> what

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
yeah there you go your markings and what

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.270

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
in terms of the quality of it but that's

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.090 
in terms of the quality of it but that's
a<00:04:38.650> better<00:04:39.070> shot<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.610> think<00:04:40.260> with<00:04:41.260> m390<00:04:41.710> is<00:04:41.860> great

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.100 
a better shot I think with m390 is great

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:44.700 
a better shot I think with m390 is great
blade<00:04:42.340> it<00:04:42.850> doesn't<00:04:43.120> rust<00:04:43.270> at<00:04:43.450> all<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:43.810> it's<00:04:44.620> a
