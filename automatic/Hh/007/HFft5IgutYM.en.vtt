00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 Hi, people here are pam and today I came. 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.120
 to do my marathon robocop 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.540
 literary is actually doing here 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.740
 a little before the marathon will is ok 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:16.980
 actually finish 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.020
 so I'll give you 12345678 books of 12 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.810
 that I planned on being one of the books 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.750
 it was not in my had the marathon air 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.090
 so do not me all but it's enough and it goes 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.880
 taking into account that I have done or 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.619
 reading from June until the date you start 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.140
 the marathon ie ends in two 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.030
 books in July I read many even 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.890
 I was really impressed by both 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.079
 he long ago this month that 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.730
 I did not see so many books like that and so much is 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:43.350
 that I'm going to give you an insured in the month of 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.210
 August I think I will not read so much 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.010
 so let's go then I'll tell 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.620
 For you, what happened during the marathon. 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.110
 half of the marathon maintained a 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:55.260
 blog for various reasons at last let's go 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.660
 Come on, I started reading the red queen. 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 I already made a video for you, it was a 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.520
 contradictory book for me I do not 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:05.129
 I liked a lot of things but I liked the 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.200
 book to the point of wanting to read the 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.850
 book then I do not know what this book 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.490
 has a province a spell that the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.760
 people leaf through and I feel like I'm close and 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.890
 The next chapter of the next book 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.619
 anyway I explained in the video things me 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.119
 bothered was the 3 star level but 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.119
 which gives me much desire to read the second 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.299
 so I also need fire 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.619
 celestial house clap the conclusion and the 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.170
 mortal Instruments 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.030
 I loved this book my favorite of the month 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.060
 the retouch to make a special to 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:39.210
 you book because it is very remarkable and it is 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.280
 amazing to see how the action of which is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.350
 is intelligent among them to all 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.820
 stories of the boss of the braiding rangers 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.530
 all the shows she wants to do 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.840
 It seems like it has to be all very well. 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.329
 planned because everything fits is very 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 cool seeing things is not always flipping 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.200
 so in history we start 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.780
 to realize that the one from there and that's why 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.399
 What happens what is known is very 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.170
 It's a very big story she can 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.390
 have control over everything I think very much 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.689
 It's cool, this reading, me too. 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:09.060
 li led model which is another book that 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.810
 I want is next but I know that too. 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.150
 it was not so good 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.730
 for me it's the book he's predictable 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.660
 but shocking things happen like this 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.340
 When the hell, we're okay. 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.750
 tatta happens a random type thing 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.390
 It's very bombastic. 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.830
 but nevertheless the story 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.090
 forwarded exactly as I predicted 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.830
 I was going to happen 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.810
 and it happened only that there have been moments 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.530
 from the book that very things happen 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:36.810
 So it's the same and it's a very tiny book. 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.700
 quick and tasty reading 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.430
 only that left me a little disappointed to 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.739
 predictability of the book itself but I 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.330
 said in the next books things 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.100
 are much more outstanding so a 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:49.170
 Shocking only with final 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.910
 so I too hopeful per second 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.950
 for the third book I'll make one 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.390
 video of that book only then I 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.430
 I want to read, the others speak a little 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.590
 more to you guys than I found from da 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.010
 The entire trilogy is from the University of 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.739
 paper that was also a book like that. 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.140
 I really liked it 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.630
 so little and so I was happy medium 

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:12.480
 It has 14 to me that has four parts 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:16.019
 book a very good one median one 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.700
 very good and a very annoying to me 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.260
 I really liked the beginning of the book and then 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.280
 staff says that the second part would be 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.989
 boring and not so boring but it was 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.170
 That's it, stop it, okay? 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:30.359
 the third part he has a one 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.549
 turnaround was very very cool better 

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:34.230
 part of the book and 10 reached the final and was 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.540
 disappointing 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.489
 so I want to kill the character who 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.700
 You're really enjoying it, so you know I was 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:43.500
 super cool and you realize just okay 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.660
 so it 's not on her side in this cup. 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.040
 to finish like this did not do anything 

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.959
 had no purpose 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.030
 so I got really excited about it 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:53.130
 some parts that so face a goal 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.660
 wonderful for these parts but it has 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:57.150
 others as soon as she looks like it was 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.290
 so tatames this book knows then me 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.790
 I really want to see the movie. 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.859
 I'll see the movie and then I'll tell 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.829
 Do you guys like the book or the book? 

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.000
 and it was not in this book that the 

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:08.220
 miami conquered but I am hoping 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.959
 For who are you, and another book that I 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.910
 I already told you the video was 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:14.160
 boy in the striped pajamas I really liked 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.260
 much of this book to thank everyone 

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:18.590
 who pointed me to the book is really very 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:21.470
 very good and I told you more 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:23.300
 video I 'd rather not I prefer the movie 

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.070
 but the film was much more 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.400
 exciting but still in the book 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.290
 fantastic even more painful so is the 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.540
 life to people who are not 

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:34.790
 vision of a 9-year-old boy and sees 

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:37.610
 that Nazism greatly impacted this boy 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.440
 of 9 years also finally read this book 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.380
 see the video I made about this book 

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:44.300
 movie and I liked very much of the 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.050
 boy in striped pajamas thence the garbage 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.180
 had super fast the best pop of paulo 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.160
 pepper is the second book in the series of 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.740
 Princesses of the Princesses Commission 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.470
 the FAO will will write I have not read the story 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:59.690
 she's still born, she's still me 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:01.100
 I should have read before but probably 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.169
 this is an extended version of the point 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.700
 It 's too much and I liked it a lot. 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.320
 I really liked it, it must have been stirred. 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.330
 I need when I feel I feel fine 

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.550
 more or less, what a lot of fun 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:12.919
 very fun and the fact that you can 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:15.470
 recognize the things of the tale of the 

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:17.000
 cinderella and yet it 's one more thing 

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.530
 updates begins to think about how 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:21.020
 She's going to do this part of the story. 

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.510
 as Paulo and find a way out and 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.220
 lights up really cool even one 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.820
 super current version super young much 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:27.380
 delicious 

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:29.630
 I loved it and it's a book I read a lot 

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:32.120
 in the sprint just there 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:33.860
 marathon and very cool recommend month 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.050
 I'm going to make a video about princess of 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.389
 emicida and cinderella pop soon to 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.729
 you and also we all recorded it 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:42.680
 cowboys of the canal well and it's a book 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.930
 of national monteiro that will pass in the 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.660
 rio grande do sul and it's about a trip 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.490
 The car that two girls do I laugh 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:52.190
 great from the south by the interior there speaks 

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:55.130
 much about discoveries about what you want 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:00.860
 Life on homosexuality these 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:06:03.560
 two girls about acceptance and sometimes 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:07.160
 as something we think it is 

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:08.660
 but it's not how others will think and it's 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.180
 quite different from everything he 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.310
 Marathon is interesting, very cool. 

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.990
 but I still do not really know what 

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.120
 think because it's a very read 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:19.130
 different the type of narrative very 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:21.080
 I really enjoyed reading and 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.150
 I got to take some things like that to 

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:25.580
 think only of books that were not in the 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:27.469
 I have no physical maxilar that he was 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:29.750
 jennifer broom's bitter love was to 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.080
 third his cover here 

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:34.330
 I think this wonderful cup is 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:35.800
 he leaves the marathon because he has a 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.599
 special thing that I still do not know if 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.069
 I can tell you but one thing 

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:41.590
 special that will happen with this 

00:06:39.069 --> 00:06:43.629
 book and then line pomegranate kids before 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:45.939
 Launch is very very cool will speak 

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:47.889
 about abusive relationship 

00:06:45.939 --> 00:06:49.479
 Once again, James Brown brings a 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.520
 so more controversial subject more 

00:06:49.479 --> 00:06:53.949
 different to be really discussed 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:56.319
 it brings with it a lot of information 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:58.569
 We pass the book on the pantries. 

00:06:56.319 --> 00:07:00.699
 there are two such ideas at the end of the 

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:03.039
 book she does some extra information 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:05.199
 who does input inspections I thought 

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.650
 just that only who is 

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:10.509
 going through that is what will happen is anyway 

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.159
 but will justify the actions that the 

00:07:10.509 --> 00:07:14.379
 people are taking it because people 

00:07:12.159 --> 00:07:15.819
 is out and already living so 

00:07:14.379 --> 00:07:17.740
 absent is what we might think 

00:07:15.819 --> 00:07:20.169
 the stupid team or parties went with me 

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.300
 in a meeting and 6 have explained why 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.770
 so save some actions are only 

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:26.319
 carried out by those who really 

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.840
 are going through the situation so she 

00:07:26.319 --> 00:07:30.669
 brings another super story without I loved it 

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:32.349
 probably you ambassadors plus one 

00:07:30.669 --> 00:07:34.449
 her book right? 

00:07:32.349 --> 00:07:35.740
 but I would highly recommend people recommend
