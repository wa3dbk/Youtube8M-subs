00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:04.509
 today it's about getting our 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:06.730
 shoes in our party bag 

00:00:04.509 --> 00:00:09.000
 starting what we have at home and little 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.000
 plus 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.690
 we may have a bag at home 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.480
 good that we had bought for some 

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.860
 wedding maybe and some shoes but we want 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.490
 use it this holiday season 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.270
 we want to give a more festive touch but 

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.880
 starting from them we do not want 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.470
 buy us anything new, well, what 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.270
 let's do today is this 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.430
 convert this bag from these shoes 

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:45.370
 that in principle we can think that no 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:47.090
 they stick together in a set we're going to 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.250
 to see how 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.870
 to do it we are going to use something very 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.600
 simple 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:57.670
 three small tweezers if possible 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.670
 be jagged so that they hold well 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.519
 I'm going to use this I explain this 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.080
 you can buy it energies are strips 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.440
 for this case we only need four 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.690
 but you can use pompoms pieces of 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.619
 skin 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:19.320
 lace a nice button of that already 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.000
 you give the imagination equal 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.900
 with what you have for home some little thing 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.490
 that you have run out of something 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:28.280
 that you have had then you can do the 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.750
 adornment the important thing is to have 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.210
 enough decorations for the two shoes 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.710
 and in this case, I 'm going to these two 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.930
 use for the bag to make a 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.430
 Brooch for the bag and the brooch I'll go 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.619
 to put in the bag but you can also 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:44.690
 put on the suit that you are going to wear 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.690
 let's see first let's separate 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.369
 let's start with the adornment 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.480
 our shoes 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.330
 I've cut two pieces of the left they're going to 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.409
 have to be hidden by the ornament or 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:20.950
 be that they have to be a little bit more 

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:20.950
 little ones 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.290
 what are we going to do 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.349
 place them here 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.370
 and now with our tail gun 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.080
 hot 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:44.080
 we are going to give the touch here 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.150
 here 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.650
 and we are going to leave our 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.650
 the important thing is that paper 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.300
 so that I can join the clamp 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.370
 And I do not know 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.720
 we will explore with taxes 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.310
 for the case of the brooch I will use 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:13.440
 two posts like this 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.230
 in one sense and another could not be the 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.700
 same as it will also depend on 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.250
 little of the adornment that you use 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:24.050
 you have to grow a bit of image 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.050
 so in this case 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:27.120
 we do the same 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.129
 cut a piece of cloth and I'm going to throw 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.129
 silicon to everything 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.800
 here 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.100
 fijaros here must be placed so 

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.490
 that stays here in hook the two 

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:52.490
 bits 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:08.110
 you know a little sticky take care I have to 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.110
 give yourself to her 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.380
 you see this could serve as a snap 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:17.470
 dress a neckline for example I 'm going 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.530
 to use for the bag we're going to see 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.810
 after this simple exercise 

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.270
 as we are going to be pretty the 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.470
 shoes and bag 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.990
 and you see 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:33.810
 with a style that I used in another 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.280
 video to help you find this 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:38.010
 party clothes inside your wardrobe 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:40.080
 plus our new bag and our 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.180
 new shoes now yes we are 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.170
 complete and we can go partying 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.170
 but also
