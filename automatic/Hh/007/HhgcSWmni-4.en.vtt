00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
come out with an amplifier that not only

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.430 
come out with an amplifier that not only
is<00:00:54.730> the<00:00:55.730> namesake<00:00:56.239> of<00:00:56.449> the<00:00:56.480> fender<00:00:56.900> but<00:00:57.170> has

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
is the namesake of the fender but has

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.579 
is the namesake of the fender but has
great<00:00:57.769> tone<00:00:58.100> as<00:00:58.309> well<00:00:58.390> the<00:00:59.390> fender<00:00:59.750> rumble<00:01:00.140> 100

is<00:01:00.710> part<00:01:00.920> of<00:01:01.010> a<00:01:01.070> series<00:01:01.460> of<00:01:01.489> amplifiers<00:01:02.089> that

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
is part of a series of amplifiers that

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.530 
is part of a series of amplifiers that
we<00:01:02.479> recently<00:01:03.470> released<00:01:04.220> this<00:01:04.460> year<00:01:04.760> 2000<00:01:05.390> for

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
we recently released this year 2000 for

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.590 
we recently released this year 2000 for
2014<00:01:06.530> and<00:01:06.740> they<00:01:07.670> are<00:01:07.729> much<00:01:07.939> lighter<00:01:08.330> in<00:01:08.450> weight

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
2014 and they are much lighter in weight

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.690 
2014 and they are much lighter in weight
which<00:01:09.170> is<00:01:09.200> one<00:01:09.530> of<00:01:09.619> the<00:01:09.740> things<00:01:10.490> that<00:01:10.670> I

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
which is one of the things that I

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.609 
which is one of the things that I
personally<00:01:11.180> enjoy<00:01:11.659> about<00:01:11.900> it

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:12.619 
personally enjoy about it

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.090 
personally enjoy about it
it's<00:01:13.210> 22<00:01:14.210> pounds<00:01:14.780> uses<00:01:15.320> a<00:01:15.350> Class<00:01:15.619> D<00:01:15.650> power

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
it's 22 pounds uses a Class D power

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.789 
it's 22 pounds uses a Class D power
amplifier<00:01:16.760> but<00:01:17.450> it<00:01:17.570> has<00:01:17.780> 10<00:01:18.200> tons<00:01:18.439> of<00:01:18.590> tones

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
amplifier but it has 10 tons of tones

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.890 
amplifier but it has 10 tons of tones
what<00:01:19.100> I<00:01:19.130> like<00:01:19.400> to<00:01:19.549> say<00:01:19.760> so<00:01:20.390> don't<00:01:20.600> let<00:01:20.750> the

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:20.900 
what I like to say so don't let the

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.609 
what I like to say so don't let the
lightness<00:01:21.380> of<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:22.360> affect<00:01:23.360> your<00:01:23.900> judgement<00:01:24.560> of

00:01:24.609 --> 00:01:24.619 
lightness of it affect your judgement of

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:26.830 
lightness of it affect your judgement of
its<00:01:24.770> tone<00:01:25.009> as<00:01:25.220> you<00:01:25.280> heard<00:01:25.850> in<00:01:25.939> the<00:01:25.970> intro<00:01:26.780> you

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
its tone as you heard in the intro you

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.109 
its tone as you heard in the intro you
can<00:01:27.020> hear<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.439> has<00:01:27.530> a<00:01:27.680> very<00:01:27.979> nice<00:01:28.130> fat<00:01:28.640> warm

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
can hear it has a very nice fat warm

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:34.870 
can hear it has a very nice fat warm
sound<00:01:30.820> but<00:01:31.820> it<00:01:31.939> also<00:01:32.119> has<00:01:32.560> different<00:01:33.880> presets

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
sound but it also has different presets

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.770 
sound but it also has different presets
that<00:01:34.999> you<00:01:35.119> can<00:01:35.240> get<00:01:35.509> a<00:01:35.539> vintage<00:01:36.320> type<00:01:36.619> tone

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.820 

so<00:01:43.780> it<00:01:43.840> gives<00:01:43.990> you<00:01:44.080> a<00:01:44.110> little<00:01:44.229> bit<00:01:44.350> more<00:01:44.500> girth

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
so it gives you a little bit more girth

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.850 
so it gives you a little bit more girth
you<00:01:45.159> also<00:01:46.000> have<00:01:46.300> a<00:01:46.330> contour<00:01:46.960> or<00:01:47.200> I<00:01:47.440> like<00:01:47.710> a

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:47.860 
you also have a contour or I like a

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.330 
you also have a contour or I like a
little<00:01:48.040> more<00:01:48.280> scoop<00:01:48.610> tone<00:01:50.100> so<00:01:51.100> if<00:01:51.220> you're

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
little more scoop tone so if you're

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.280 
little more scoop tone so if you're
going<00:01:51.460> to<00:01:51.520> do<00:01:51.670> a<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:55.180> of<00:01:55.270> slap<00:01:55.540> and<00:01:55.780> pop<00:01:55.810> thing

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
going to do a kind of slap and pop thing

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.050 
going to do a kind of slap and pop thing
you<00:01:56.500> might<00:01:56.710> want<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:57.010> try<00:01:57.190> using<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.670> contour

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
you might want to try using the contour

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.540 
you might want to try using the contour
button<00:01:58.450> and<00:01:58.720> it<00:01:59.200> also<00:01:59.350> has<00:01:59.619> a<00:01:59.650> bright<00:01:59.979> tone<00:02:00.250> so

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
button and it also has a bright tone so

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.130 
button and it also has a bright tone so
if<00:02:00.640> you're<00:02:00.790> really<00:02:01.119> one<00:02:01.780> of<00:02:01.810> those<00:02:01.930> bass

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
if you're really one of those bass

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.320 
if you're really one of those bass
players<00:02:02.470> who<00:02:02.740> want<00:02:02.920> to<00:02:03.009> cut<00:02:03.250> through<00:02:03.430> some<00:02:04.240> of

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
players who want to cut through some of

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.130 
players who want to cut through some of
the<00:02:04.390> guitar<00:02:04.660> players<00:02:04.960> tones<00:02:09.899> still<00:02:10.899> very

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
the guitar players tones still very

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.699 
the guitar players tones still very
round<00:02:11.410> but<00:02:11.709> up<00:02:11.800> in<00:02:11.890> the<00:02:11.950> higher<00:02:12.160> end<00:02:13.709> it's

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
round but up in the higher end it's

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.750 
round but up in the higher end it's
going<00:02:14.860> to<00:02:14.920> give<00:02:15.070> you<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.220> little<00:02:15.400> bit<00:02:15.580> more

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
going to give you a little bit more

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.500 
going to give you a little bit more
upper<00:02:16.660> range<00:02:17.670> one<00:02:18.670> of<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.820> fun<00:02:19.000> things<00:02:19.209> too

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
upper range one of the fun things too

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.750 
upper range one of the fun things too
about<00:02:19.780> this<00:02:19.989> amplifier<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.100> it<00:02:21.220> has<00:02:21.430> an

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
about this amplifier is that it has an

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.150 
about this amplifier is that it has an
overdrive<00:02:22.420> and<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.200> foot<00:02:23.410> switchable<00:02:23.860> so

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
overdrive and this is foot switchable so

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:34.490 
overdrive and this is foot switchable so
you<00:02:24.250> can<00:02:24.519> buy<00:02:24.670> the<00:02:24.730> optional<00:02:25.300> foot<00:02:25.450> switch

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.370 

and<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.700> gives<00:02:35.790> you<00:02:35.970> a<00:02:36.000> nice<00:02:36.360> thick<00:02:36.690> girth<00:02:37.020> now

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:37.380 
and it gives you a nice thick girth now

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.410 
and it gives you a nice thick girth now
there's<00:02:37.560> a<00:02:37.680> drive<00:02:37.980> and<00:02:38.220> as<00:02:38.430> well<00:02:38.760> as<00:02:38.970> a<00:02:39.000> level

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
there's a drive and as well as a level

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.840 
there's a drive and as well as a level
so<00:02:39.870> if<00:02:40.200> you<00:02:40.320> wanted<00:02:40.560> to<00:02:40.620> boost<00:02:40.920> this<00:02:41.220> for<00:02:41.580> a

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
so if you wanted to boost this for a

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.580 
so if you wanted to boost this for a
little<00:02:42.210> passage<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.750> might<00:02:42.930> be<00:02:43.050> doing<00:02:43.230> in<00:02:43.530> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
little passage you might be doing in a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.940 
little passage you might be doing in a
song<00:02:43.830> it's<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.490> great<00:02:44.730> way<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.690> basically<00:02:46.080> give

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
song it's a great way to basically give

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:48.500 
song it's a great way to basically give
you<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> little<00:02:47.430> bit<00:02:47.520> of<00:02:47.610> a<00:02:47.670> boost<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.270> some

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
you a little bit of a boost and some

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.480 
you a little bit of a boost and some
girth<00:02:48.720> and<00:02:49.110> make<00:02:49.680> your<00:02:49.860> parts<00:02:50.160> stand<00:02:50.370> out<00:02:52.490> if

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
girth and make your parts stand out if

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.230 
girth and make your parts stand out if
you<00:02:54.180> wanted<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.630> set<00:02:55.200> the<00:02:55.230> level<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.710> do<00:02:55.830> such

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:56.240 
you wanted to set the level to do such

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.230 
you wanted to set the level to do such
it<00:02:57.240> also<00:02:57.390> has<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.780> bass<00:02:58.350> low-mid<00:02:59.070> high-mid

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
it also has a bass low-mid high-mid

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.560 
it also has a bass low-mid high-mid
treble<00:03:00.240> and<00:03:00.450> master<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.860> it<00:03:02.820> gives<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.210> a<00:03:03.240> nice

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:03.570 
treble and master so it gives you a nice

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.350 
treble and master so it gives you a nice
thick<00:03:04.170> warm<00:03:04.650> tone<00:03:05.040> or<00:03:05.370> if<00:03:05.700> you<00:03:05.850> want<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> slap

thick warm tone or if you want to slap

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:08.030 
thick warm tone or if you want to slap
and<00:03:06.600> pop<00:03:06.630> you<00:03:06.990> can<00:03:07.140> get<00:03:07.290> those<00:03:07.410> type<00:03:07.680> of<00:03:07.709> tones

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
and pop you can get those type of tones

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.520 
and pop you can get those type of tones
out<00:03:08.190> of<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.459> as<00:03:08.640> well<00:03:08.790> on<00:03:09.120> the<00:03:09.930> back<00:03:10.110> and<00:03:10.440> then

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
out of this as well on the back and then

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.949 
out of this as well on the back and then
you'll<00:03:10.680> see<00:03:10.920> in<00:03:11.040> a<00:03:11.100> little<00:03:11.190> bit<00:03:11.340> a<00:03:11.750> panel<00:03:12.750> that

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
you'll see in a little bit a panel that

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
has a low Z output so you can go direct

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.210 
has a low Z output so you can go direct
into<00:03:16.980> your<00:03:17.580> recording<00:03:18.150> gear<00:03:18.480> or<00:03:18.750> into<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> board

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
into your recording gear or into a board

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.150 
into your recording gear or into a board
for<00:03:20.820> live<00:03:21.000> sound<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.630> has<00:03:22.500> a<00:03:22.530> ground<00:03:22.770> lift<00:03:23.010> as
