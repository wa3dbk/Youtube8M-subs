00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
coaches age specific information and we

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.050 
coaches age specific information and we
still<00:02:13.650> have<00:02:13.800> our<00:02:13.830> coaching<00:02:14.310> clinics<00:02:14.640> intact

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
still have our coaching clinics intact

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.210 
still have our coaching clinics intact
where<00:02:15.599> we've<00:02:16.170> slowed<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.590> process<00:02:17.040> down

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
where we've slowed the process down

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.980 
where we've slowed the process down
where<00:02:17.430> it<00:02:17.520> coach<00:02:17.670> only<00:02:17.970> takes<00:02:18.180> one<00:02:18.390> clinic<00:02:18.780> per

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
specific modules do they give the coach

that particular age group and if you're

that particular age group and if you're
coaching<00:02:30.180> an<00:02:30.269> eight-year-old<00:02:30.720> we<00:02:30.930> want<00:02:31.260> to

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
coaching an eight-year-old we want to

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.930 
coaching an eight-year-old we want to
give<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.620> coach<00:02:31.830> everything<00:02:32.400> that<00:02:32.550> they<00:02:32.700> need

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
give the coach everything that they need

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.430 
give the coach everything that they need
to<00:02:33.060> know<00:02:33.209> about<00:02:33.360> coaching<00:02:33.870> an<00:02:33.959> eight-year-old

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
to know about coaching an eight-year-old

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.860 
to know about coaching an eight-year-old
player<00:02:35.069> whether<00:02:35.790> that's<00:02:36.090> everything<00:02:36.599> from

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
player whether that's everything from

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:38.180 
player whether that's everything from
what<00:02:37.170> they<00:02:37.260> should<00:02:37.440> be<00:02:37.530> doing<00:02:37.680> on<00:02:37.950> the<00:02:38.069> ice

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
what they should be doing on the ice

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.309 
what they should be doing on the ice
from<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.519> skill<00:02:38.790> development<00:02:39.180> standpoint<00:02:39.599> to

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
from a skill development standpoint to

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:42.229 
from a skill development standpoint to
off<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.680> ice<00:02:40.830> we<00:02:41.430> wanted<00:02:41.700> to<00:02:41.760> hit<00:02:41.849> everything

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
off the ice we wanted to hit everything

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:43.910 
off the ice we wanted to hit everything
across<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> board<00:02:43.200> so<00:02:43.410> when<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.650> coach

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
across the board so when that coach

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.850 
across the board so when that coach
finished<00:02:44.340> the<00:02:44.459> module<00:02:44.880> that<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.989> the<00:02:46.110> end<00:02:46.319> we

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
finished the module that in the end we

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.530 
finished the module that in the end we
felt<00:02:47.099> like<00:02:47.220> we<00:02:47.489> gave<00:02:47.700> them<00:02:47.910> everything<00:02:48.239> they

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
felt like we gave them everything they

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.089 
felt like we gave them everything they
needed<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.959> know<00:02:49.019> about<00:02:49.110> that<00:02:49.470> particular<00:02:49.620> age

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:50.099 
needed to know about that particular age

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:52.820 
needed to know about that particular age
group<00:02:50.340> I<00:02:50.670> think<00:02:51.599> now<00:02:51.780> since<00:02:52.290> we're<00:02:52.440> finally

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
group I think now since we're finally

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:54.820 
group I think now since we're finally
giving<00:02:53.099> coaches<00:02:53.549> the<00:02:53.849> tools<00:02:54.120> that<00:02:54.330> they<00:02:54.599> need

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
giving coaches the tools that they need

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.949 
giving coaches the tools that they need
to<00:02:55.830> coach<00:02:56.099> a<00:02:56.250> certain<00:02:56.580> age<00:02:56.849> group<00:02:57.209> I<00:02:57.480> think

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
to coach a certain age group I think

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:59.570 
to coach a certain age group I think
that's<00:02:58.319> going<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.680> great<00:02:59.010> impact<00:02:59.160> on

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
that's going to have a great impact on

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.089 
that's going to have a great impact on
the<00:02:59.730> player<00:02:59.970> because<00:03:00.720> now<00:03:00.959> we're<00:03:01.319> we're

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:02.099 
the player because now we're we're

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.240 
the player because now we're we're
coaching<00:03:02.579> the<00:03:02.910> player<00:03:03.560> properly<00:03:04.560> you<00:03:05.160> know

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
coaching the player properly you know

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.770 
coaching the player properly you know
the<00:03:05.400> science<00:03:05.760> says<00:03:06.000> we<00:03:06.030> should<00:03:06.420> be<00:03:06.540> doing

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
the science says we should be doing

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.360 
the science says we should be doing
certain<00:03:07.079> things<00:03:07.260> when<00:03:07.739> it<00:03:07.829> comes<00:03:08.010> to<00:03:08.160> long

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
certain things when it comes to long

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.940 
certain things when it comes to long
term<00:03:08.610> athlete<00:03:08.790> development<00:03:09.060> in<00:03:09.780> the<00:03:10.380> past<00:03:10.590> a

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
term athlete development in the past a

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:13.729 
term athlete development in the past a
coach<00:03:11.250> would<00:03:11.519> typically<00:03:11.910> coach<00:03:12.299> a<00:03:12.599> team<00:03:12.959> based

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:13.739 
coach would typically coach a team based

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.610 
coach would typically coach a team based
upon<00:03:14.130> maybe<00:03:14.880> how<00:03:15.120> they<00:03:15.329> were<00:03:15.390> coached<00:03:15.750> now<00:03:16.560> the

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
upon maybe how they were coached now the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:18.800 
upon maybe how they were coached now the
science<00:03:17.160> says<00:03:17.400> we<00:03:17.880> should<00:03:18.090> be<00:03:18.180> doing<00:03:18.450> certain

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
science says we should be doing certain

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.199 
science says we should be doing certain
things<00:03:19.049> at<00:03:19.260> certain<00:03:19.470> age<00:03:19.769> groups<00:03:20.130> and<00:03:20.400> I<00:03:20.910> think

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
things at certain age groups and I think

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.720 
things at certain age groups and I think
what<00:03:21.420> we're<00:03:21.569> gonna<00:03:21.660> see<00:03:21.959> is<00:03:22.430> over<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.549> course

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
what we're gonna see is over the course

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.670 
what we're gonna see is over the course
of<00:03:23.940> time<00:03:24.239> we're<00:03:24.750> gonna<00:03:24.810> see<00:03:25.110> better<00:03:25.410> hockey

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
of time we're gonna see better hockey

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.650 
of time we're gonna see better hockey
players<00:03:26.130> being<00:03:26.400> developed<00:03:26.940> and<00:03:27.090> I<00:03:27.299> think<00:03:27.540> in

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
players being developed and I think in

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:28.729 
players being developed and I think in
the<00:03:27.780> end<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.139> players<00:03:28.380> are<00:03:28.530> going<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> have

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
the end the players are going to have

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.100 
the end the players are going to have
more<00:03:29.040> fun
