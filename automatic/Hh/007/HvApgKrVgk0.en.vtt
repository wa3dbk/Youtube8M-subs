00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.270 
that and then my main reason for the
whole<00:03:03.410> order<00:03:04.180> besides<00:03:05.180> paper<00:03:05.959> pads<00:03:06.290> was<00:03:06.920> to

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:07.280 
whole order besides paper pads was to

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:09.130 
whole order besides paper pads was to
get<00:03:07.400> these<00:03:07.610> magnets<00:03:08.209> these<00:03:08.450> are<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.720> basic

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 
get these magnets these are the basic

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.430 
get these magnets these are the basic
gray<00:03:10.000> magnetic<00:03:11.000> disks<00:03:11.480> these<00:03:11.870> are<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.110> small

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
gray magnetic disks these are the small

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:15.520 
gray magnetic disks these are the small
ones<00:03:12.470> so<00:03:13.130> there's<00:03:13.340> 20<00:03:14.000> on<00:03:14.120> here<00:03:14.500> which<00:03:15.500> gives

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
ones so there's 20 on here which gives

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.280 
ones so there's 20 on here which gives
you<00:03:16.040> a<00:03:16.070> set<00:03:16.459> of<00:03:16.640> 10<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.760> yeah<00:03:20.660> they<00:03:21.110> had<00:03:21.260> a

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
you a set of 10 so yeah they had a

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.920 
you a set of 10 so yeah they had a
pretty<00:03:21.530> good<00:03:21.620> price<00:03:21.890> for<00:03:22.010> these<00:03:22.459> so<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.840> went

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:23.930 
pretty good price for these so you went

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.920 
pretty good price for these so you went
ahead<00:03:24.080> and<00:03:24.260> got<00:03:24.380> those<00:03:24.850> so<00:03:25.850> that's<00:03:26.360> it<00:03:26.630> that's

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
ahead and got those so that's it that's
