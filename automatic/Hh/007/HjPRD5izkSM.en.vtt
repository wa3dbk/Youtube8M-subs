00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.590
 when dismantling they see us, the government sees 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.860

 how and how fast it opens 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.900
 how fast the site opens 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.990

 colors 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.060
 official character 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:45.840
 we are trying to let us together 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.560
 on boeing devices 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.560
 by the way for a dollar to him with this and hacker.ru 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.290

 it simultaneously we press 

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:18.619
 in the trading network something like that is a goal 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:20.969
 gone download

 they sit in one mow the Incas were 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:24.109
 updated 

00:02:24.109 --> 00:02:27.109
 so 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.619
 so only take speed but 

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:34.760
 devices to launch vitya what are we 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.879
 confronted on facebook see 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.229
 stepan finished 

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:40.659
 the girl continues her work 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.930
 but most likely it is caused by a mass of emotions 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.370
 reasons but the main reason is that he 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.409
 votes a 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:48.699
 she considered to look speed 

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:50.699
 really works 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:53.669
 Tomi website from November 18 

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:55.389
 government of Poland and the Czech Republic 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:57.719
 if there is a nose here 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:02:59.449
 I considered from the publisher not only 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:00.859
 advantage 

00:03:00.859 --> 00:03:01.660
 we are 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.360
 we will call you a flaw because 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.769
 that he is the main brake 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:06.570
 in all 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.719
 So we are watching the launch 

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.250
 saw but also methods 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.699
 largely 

00:03:11.699 --> 00:03:13.209
 sunspot initiative 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:16.209
 on the eve of 7 05 

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:21.980
 playfully 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.469
 tons 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:27.399
 enter it is planned to open refugees and 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:28.439
 other 

00:03:28.439 --> 00:03:31.439
 chekalin 

00:03:34.999 --> 00:03:36.939
 we see that privatization if 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:39.139
 fast everything works no problems with 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.479
 lower speed boss 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:42.349
 tragic portrayed saw 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:43.829
 fine 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.979
 at least the weather 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:48.240
 and especially in Poland 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.299
 which is so 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.039
 as a result of the necessary 

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:56.609
 And the question is solved Of course, you are right 

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:00.759
 Deraa and employees yet 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:05.120
 imagine that we have for example they do not 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.789
 performed 

00:04:06.789 --> 00:04:10.389
 and what do your values ​​do 10 if they are still 

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:13.019
 more unusual than that 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:14.739
 It is very strange 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.039
 quality 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:20.039
 another thing with cats 

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:24.939
 cube this approach with it 

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:27.529
 government as happens with this 

00:04:27.529 --> 00:04:28.560
 video 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:31.309
 the only exception 

00:04:31.309 --> 00:04:36.419
 You can compare the battlefield to the rise of flash I 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.020
 I think what's next 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.469
 their 

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:42.219
 Kay 

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:45.219
 hajj 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:52.579
 such is the conclusion that such a reputation is his 

00:04:52.579 --> 00:04:55.579
 concerns 06 points 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.379
 when confronted by a doctor this money also considers 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:03.379
 what is letting another one of the girls 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.240
 the meaning of these words to the point 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.090
 it is no longer easy to reach people can 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.830
 get captured by five people 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.889
 get the bait 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.659
 vivid examples billion 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:19.909
 over the weekend 

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:22.979
 or not likely 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:25.400
 if you don't want to read 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.400
 over the coming years 

00:05:29.629 --> 00:05:31.879
 mw 

00:05:31.879 --> 00:05:35.150
 4 why not 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:37.479
 clear goals 

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.279
 m 

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:42.009
 after that first of all only the interface 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:44.909
 Site court sentenced 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.229
 Kharkov, Odessa, Lvov, Kharkov, Kharkov 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:51.520
 resulting market 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.059
 former striker 

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:55.129
 the next day 

00:05:55.129 --> 00:05:57.699
 with 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:02.870
 one step away from Warsaw 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.849
 everything was good to be honest 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:09.020
 in helsinki 12 in the process
