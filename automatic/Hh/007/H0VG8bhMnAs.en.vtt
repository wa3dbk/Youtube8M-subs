00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
would say when it comes to that if

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.649 
would say when it comes to that if
Batman<00:01:52.409> can<00:01:52.590> get<00:01:52.740> close<00:01:52.950> to<00:01:53.130> him<00:01:53.450> Batman<00:01:54.450> might

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
Batman can get close to him Batman might

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.510 
Batman can get close to him Batman might
have<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.990> edge<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.860> way<00:01:56.040> I<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.369> this

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
have the edge now the way I see this

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.490 
have the edge now the way I see this
battle<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:57.090> is<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.630> definitely<00:01:58.020> gonna<00:01:58.170> see

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
battle going is I definitely gonna see

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
with both the force push and of course

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.029 
with both the force push and of course
uses<00:02:05.909> his<00:02:06.030> lightsaber<00:02:06.630> now<00:02:07.320> Batman<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.799> try

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
uses his lightsaber now Batman will try

uses his lightsaber now Batman will try
to<00:02:08.099> disarm<00:02:08.580> Darth<00:02:09.090> Vader<00:02:09.330> from<00:02:09.509> his

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
to disarm Darth Vader from his

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.780 
to disarm Darth Vader from his
lightsaber<00:02:10.110> by<00:02:10.470> probably<00:02:11.190> using<00:02:11.489> some<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:11.670> his

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
lightsaber by probably using some of his

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.990 
lightsaber by probably using some of his
projectile<00:02:12.480> weapon

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
projectile weapon

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.840 
projectile weapon
like<00:02:13.300> the<00:02:13.840> Batarang<00:02:14.800> maybe<00:02:15.070> his<00:02:15.280> grappling

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
like the Batarang maybe his grappling

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:19.500 
like the Batarang maybe his grappling
gun<00:02:16.030> but<00:02:16.810> we<00:02:17.110> all<00:02:17.260> know<00:02:17.500> how<00:02:17.740> well<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:19.000> senses

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
gun but we all know how well the senses

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.050 
gun but we all know how well the senses
of<00:02:19.690> a<00:02:19.870> Jedi<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> Sith<00:02:20.530> is<00:02:21.340> so<00:02:21.700> keen<00:02:22.030> that

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
of a Jedi and the Sith is so keen that

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.270 
of a Jedi and the Sith is so keen that
they'll<00:02:22.390> be<00:02:22.510> able<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.930> block<00:02:23.290> any<00:02:23.740> kind<00:02:24.220> of

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
they'll be able to block any kind of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.910 
they'll be able to block any kind of
projectiles<00:02:24.820> with<00:02:25.090> their<00:02:25.410> lightsaber<00:02:26.410> and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
projectiles with their lightsaber and

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.740 
projectiles with their lightsaber and
again<00:02:27.280> Batman's<00:02:27.700> gonna<00:02:27.880> try<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.240> get<00:02:28.450> close<00:02:28.720> to

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
again Batman's gonna try to get close to

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.210 
again Batman's gonna try to get close to
him<00:02:29.110> and<00:02:29.170> he<00:02:29.260> knows<00:02:29.470> that<00:02:29.500> he<00:02:29.740> can't<00:02:30.010> get

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:30.220 
him and he knows that he can't get

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:32.310 
him and he knows that he can't get
closer<00:02:30.459> because<00:02:30.670> of<00:02:30.880> his<00:02:30.970> force<00:02:31.240> push<00:02:31.540> and<00:02:31.780> his

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
closer because of his force push and his

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.230 
closer because of his force push and his
life<00:02:32.500> so<00:02:32.650> if<00:02:32.680> he<00:02:32.950> still<00:02:33.190> has<00:02:33.400> it<00:02:33.430> so<00:02:33.970> of<00:02:34.090> course

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
life so if he still has it so of course

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.030 
life so if he still has it so of course
he's<00:02:34.420> gonna<00:02:34.570> try<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.870> use<00:02:34.990> some<00:02:35.470> kind<00:02:35.740> of<00:02:35.890> a

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
he's gonna try to use some kind of a

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
he's gonna try to use some kind of a
diversion<00:02:36.459> like<00:02:36.820> smoke<00:02:37.120> pellets<00:02:37.510> or<00:02:37.690> flash

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
diversion like smoke pellets or flash

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
diversion like smoke pellets or flash
bombs<00:02:38.260> but<00:02:39.070> again<00:02:39.490> his<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.600> Darth<00:02:40.870> Vader's

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
bombs but again his the Darth Vader's

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.610 
bombs but again his the Darth Vader's
force<00:02:41.620> is<00:02:42.390> gonna<00:02:43.390> help<00:02:43.750> him<00:02:43.959> be<00:02:44.260> aware<00:02:44.560> of

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
force is gonna help him be aware of

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.010 
force is gonna help him be aware of
where<00:02:45.070> he's<00:02:45.280> gonna<00:02:45.400> be<00:02:45.520> around<00:02:46.030> so<00:02:46.270> stealth<00:02:46.750> is

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.020 
where he's gonna be around so stealth is

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.020 
where he's gonna be around so stealth is
probably<00:02:47.470> not<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.800> the<00:02:47.920> best<00:02:48.100> case<00:02:48.370> for<00:02:48.400> Batman

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
probably not in the best case for Batman

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.390 
probably not in the best case for Batman
and<00:02:49.180> again<00:02:49.840> if<00:02:50.080> bama<00:02:50.350> has<00:02:50.709> the<00:02:51.010> proper

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
and again if bama has the proper

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
and again if bama has the proper
preparation<00:02:51.730> he<00:02:52.209> will<00:02:52.360> know<00:02:52.510> exactly<00:02:52.690> what<00:02:53.380> to

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
preparation he will know exactly what to

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.680 
preparation he will know exactly what to
do<00:02:53.650> but<00:02:54.370> if<00:02:54.670> the<00:02:54.820> fight<00:02:55.030> went<00:02:55.270> on<00:02:55.360> long<00:02:55.660> enough

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
do but if the fight went on long enough

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.050 
do but if the fight went on long enough
he<00:02:56.200> will<00:02:56.350> probably<00:02:56.830> find<00:02:57.310> a<00:02:57.430> weakness<00:02:57.670> on

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
he will probably find a weakness on

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.820 
he will probably find a weakness on
Darth<00:02:58.450> right<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:58.989> weakness<00:02:59.230> is<00:02:59.560> his

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
Darth right and that weakness is his

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.100 
Darth right and that weakness is his
helmet<00:03:00.280> just<00:03:00.670> like<00:03:00.880> how<00:03:01.120> he<00:03:01.150> defeats<00:03:01.690> Bane

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:02.110 
helmet just like how he defeats Bane

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.199 
helmet just like how he defeats Bane
every<00:03:02.590> time<00:03:02.830> when<00:03:03.070> he<00:03:03.160> faces<00:03:03.430> him<00:03:03.760> by<00:03:03.910> going

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:04.209 
every time when he faces him by going

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:06.900 
every time when he faces him by going
for<00:03:04.540> those<00:03:04.720> venom<00:03:05.530> tubes<00:03:05.830> that<00:03:06.190> makes<00:03:06.610> him<00:03:06.760> so

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
for those venom tubes that makes him so

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.120 
for those venom tubes that makes him so
strong<00:03:07.320> Batman<00:03:08.320> is<00:03:08.440> gonna<00:03:08.620> go<00:03:08.800> for<00:03:09.010> that

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
strong Batman is gonna go for that

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:11.160 
strong Batman is gonna go for that
advantage<00:03:09.640> by<00:03:09.820> taking<00:03:10.270> off<00:03:10.480> probably<00:03:10.840> trying

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
advantage by taking off probably trying

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:12.930 
advantage by taking off probably trying
to<00:03:11.230> take<00:03:11.410> off<00:03:11.560> Darth<00:03:11.920> Vader's<00:03:12.250> mass<00:03:12.459> where

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:12.940 
to take off Darth Vader's mass where

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:14.190 
to take off Darth Vader's mass where
he's<00:03:13.090> gonna<00:03:13.180> have<00:03:13.480> a<00:03:13.510> hard<00:03:13.780> time<00:03:13.840> breathing

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
he's gonna have a hard time breathing

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.580 
he's gonna have a hard time breathing
and<00:03:14.530> that<00:03:14.970> might<00:03:15.970> possibly<00:03:16.239> be<00:03:16.690> the<00:03:16.720> edge<00:03:17.170> that

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
and that might possibly be the edge that

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.430 
and that might possibly be the edge that
Batman<00:03:18.040> needs<00:03:18.280> to<00:03:18.580> win<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.060> fight<00:03:19.330> but<00:03:20.140> again

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
Batman needs to win the fight but again

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.520 
Batman needs to win the fight but again
I<00:03:20.620> doubt<00:03:21.100> that<00:03:21.840> Darth<00:03:22.840> Vader<00:03:22.900> is<00:03:23.110> gonna<00:03:23.260> give

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
I doubt that Darth Vader is gonna give

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.250 
I doubt that Darth Vader is gonna give
him<00:03:23.680> that<00:03:23.709> chance<00:03:23.920> of<00:03:24.730> opportunity<00:03:25.690> to<00:03:25.900> make

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
him that chance of opportunity to make

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.130 
him that chance of opportunity to make
this<00:03:26.440> fight<00:03:26.680> go<00:03:26.860> longer<00:03:27.130> again<00:03:27.790> he's<00:03:28.269> a<00:03:28.299> Sith

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
this fight go longer again he's a Sith

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.729 
this fight go longer again he's a Sith
Lord<00:03:29.170> and<00:03:29.850> when<00:03:30.850> the<00:03:31.030> timing<00:03:31.480> is<00:03:31.600> right<00:03:31.739> he

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:32.739 
Lord and when the timing is right he

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:34.530 
Lord and when the timing is right he
might<00:03:32.950> end<00:03:33.130> up<00:03:33.370> doing<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.730> force<00:03:33.970> choke<00:03:34.269> on

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540
