00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.740
 Well here we look back to 2014 and 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.740
 exists in hermosillo 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.950
 I just opened the track 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:29.410
 14 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:32.380
 then glue first of all a 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 date that schedules schedule the 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 jobs 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.300
 the most this date by date 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:43.200
 the one that mentioned a season as 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.200
 so 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.890
 one 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.480
 streep super queen 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.100
 okay 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.910
 with regard to what in your view of the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:24.960
 network is that there was Manriquez recently 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:27.470
 against that of sandino and pressure it 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.470
 commented a lot about that race of certain 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.470
 things 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.470
 manrique against the brands 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:50.160
 all those defeats because to me 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.380
 I want you empowered in the end are 400 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.149
 meters was something old guy there was no light 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.149
 you can not go out with your hand 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:04.829
 it is not justification 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.320
 with respect to the people who challenge you 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.200
 he wanted to win you that he has not won 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.739
 ever you want to say to the 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.739
 from here 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.160
 or sometimes simply 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:36.010
 I see photos no longer have micro plans 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:38.260
 will go and ryan or is there any other event will 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:41.680
 that comes the las vegas and it is an event 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:45.239
 it must be enough to work 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.239
 you will also decide 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:04.140
 and then something you want to say to the 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:04.140
 people that we have 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:22.420
