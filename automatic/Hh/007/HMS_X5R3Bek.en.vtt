00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.580
 hi to all these choco for the videos 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.190
 tutorial on pro evolution soccer so for 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.960
 wait until the release of pes 2015 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.910
 coming out on November 13th, I'm going 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 offer you tutorial videos on 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.680
 how to play the game and especially how 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.779
 enjoy the features that were in 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.900
 the old ps if you come from fifa 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.619
 so in pes is a key features them 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.150
 manual passes 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.560
 so it's really a feature that 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.880
 is very important when playing 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.219
 against a player who is used to 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 play at pes and that's a future what 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.890
 I will show you right away 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.020
 how can we apply it 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.850
 there I am with arturo vidal or tevez I 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 know more I passed the ball and via 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.820
 my side rear which is on the left 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.829
 while avoiding I think it's beautiful 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.050
 fight that is in front of him so I 'm going 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 hold l 2 and I press x and the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.120
 blow I put the ball directly to 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.590
 players I want to find I'm going 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.690
 to go back with the one signed such he has 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.309
 played fast and the second sense too much and I 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.649
 will go directly to the defender 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.260
 lateral while holding l 2 then by 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.670
 fault the directional guide is active 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.409
 and I disable it because I have 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.880
 not want to see the game not want to 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.170
 give the information if you want to 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.729
 my opponent like what I'm going to do 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.869
 a manual pass then fools you there 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.369
 see the small arrow halls that 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.409
 appears 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:17.939
 I alternate between normal path attended 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.369
 in quotation marks and then there's no 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.860
 to lean since the g and lester the 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.509
 button l2 and I can put you the 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.189
 balloon really you saw the at 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.200
 nobody up to foolish game can 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.299
 dismiss the game and it works also on 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
 transversals so that allows you 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.700
 you had to jump and the defenders 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.070
 to arrive directly on the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.659
 side and so you're sure to 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.850
 make the pass in the right place 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.439
 so this feature the device for 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.090
 go directly to the guardian she will you 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.729
 also allows you to support your pass 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.439
 in the back but especially so 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.540
 offensive so I'm going to show you everything 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.540
 what about pes 2015 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.020
 so here we are sure pes 2015 and there I 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.830
 will show you a typical action so 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.930
 in attack 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.180

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.420
 two with götze there is muller I want 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.610
 be it götze who receives the ball 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.350
 so I will maintain l 2 and do the 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.790
 go behind so that it 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.080
 get foot in the feet of götze you 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:14.790

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.210
