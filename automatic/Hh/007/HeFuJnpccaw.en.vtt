00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:20.759
 We go with the engineer Ramiro Bandera 

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:23.140
 a day of low livestock farmers to whom 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.830
 in the interest of galicia democratic change in since it exploded 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.589
 presentation that took place this morning 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.869
 here in the inta delicias 

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:35.490
 well now the dissertation was basically based on showing some 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.790
 trials that we have the marginal soil type 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.160
 the silala is what we want is this and the livestock 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.880
 already you are moving type of environments therefore we see that by 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.980
 hundred reliquary have information that they are the ones to tolerate 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.700
 this type of soil we would be these soil constraints 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.720
 and on the other hand it will start by percent and quantify how much they produce from pasture 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:00.350
 to say as the first objective would be that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.200
 therefore good for a hundred my goal the let's say or in the day was to show 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.540
 some are given some trials that we have as much of childhood as 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.590
 rainy in this kind of environments 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.030
 gift of flying some we have some data 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.240
 percent and on another flight that's why they've been implanted and that 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.740
 good percent in a short time 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.759
 eric we will put information as to berth to start 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.580
 nothing so we had to put a few percent questions as to what 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.579
 I told you to say 

00:01:27.579 --> 00:01:29.429
 what is needed is achieved 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:33.849
 achieve that type of conditions and what grass production let's say we can 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.690
 in peace we move per cent field of a product are not where 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.550
 they have sachs they also counted because we saw that field that experience 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.670
 What was it that you showed every day to all the producers and technicians 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.870
 present 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.540
 Now that's basically what we can show is that possible already 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.700
 I showed 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.939
 that is, there are species that adapt effectively sepes and forages environment 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.940
 percent and what good compared let's say with the natural condition of that soil 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:05.920
 It is possible to improve the forage offer that kind of environments 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.339
 now with good we have to go adjusting 

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:13.429
 and I'm blind I love what fertilization strategy and so on 

00:02:13.429 --> 00:02:17.609
 try to produce grass quantify it and see what time of year it occurs 

00:02:17.609 --> 00:02:21.169
 not as first step first goal is to say you notice a very big difference 

00:02:21.169 --> 00:02:24.469
 between the natural environment and the environment where they were making those simple 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.130
 testing of places or trials 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.350
 yes yes as you say is that way you really noticed difference with people 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.549
 in that human pulse at least a puertollano vision we have data but 

00:02:34.549 --> 00:02:36.629
 it's good that this environment is possible 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.609
 percent and I sayaka saype figure that they adapt that kind of floors 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.619
 and how good it is possible to get pasture production in that frenzy 

00:02:44.619 --> 00:02:48.739
 of that kind of environments embol last a brief comment on the passage of the 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.489
 days and that you thought that you think people are meeting 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:56.409
 now only that people did not seem to me or at least that frost the 

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.889
 amount of public has been quite numerous 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.049
 on the one hand 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.249
 he and on the other hand that good this shows that there is a great interest for 

00:03:04.249 --> 00:03:04.939
 hundred 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.900
 in beginning to answer this kind of question how do you get out I said say there 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.230
 very little information is of the kind of environments equal to the producers and 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.760
 and in turn the same technicians are also interested in seeing what 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:20.189
 form will be echoed to be able to start producing aesthetic paste environments 

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:23.189
 there was thank you very much it is not up to you 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.209
 we are a days ago in the day of handling of vintage bass we are in 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.839
 in your field we came to see an experience and we want you to tell us 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.349
 a little bit what they could show the archer to the 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.119
 producers and technicians present 

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:53.229
 good that the monarch just good what we came to see this afternoon b 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:55.039
 the journey that Inca made 

00:03:55.039 --> 00:04:00.749
 the homing and two years we have been working with the channel bars and 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:04.529
 and good percent in our case after him they deserved a 

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:07.109
 flood of 2001 that did not let 

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.319
 very the very battered countryside 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:10.619
 in the low areas 

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:14.279
 good we encourage each other with different species be it tomorrow 

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.959
 festuca severity clovers 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.579
 i min 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:23.759
 since 91 percent in percent with and pulls paper 

00:04:23.759 --> 00:04:25.610
 i with all my brother Martin 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:31.159
 percent and 3 per 100 and we are in a 160 hectares a system or do by 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:35.690
 hundred and that are consists of 85 plots of one 800 hectare each one almost 2 

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.419
 percent and with a 

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:41.300
 alley is that they carry the water to the plots 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.610
 and good and we decided on it 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.180
 never taking of pastures of low cole a complement with the system or 

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.909
 make 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.719
 percent and with high load percent and hacienda and with listeners and mind what 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:55.749
 we came to see today 

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:59.130
 well how are those experiences with the results that are having 

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:04.120
 not the results of very satisfactory at least percent we belong to a 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.520
 group believe that I also have working hard 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.879
 the inta that did not come was a very important hand we have to win to learn to 

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:14.750
 work of the goal we did not hear what we did no no no and simone a recipe 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.289
 but therefore we are going a quite way 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.879
 pretty good thank god 

00:05:20.879 --> 00:05:25.279
 the boe is he the irrigation zone has made the low 11 people risk 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:29.950
 since 87 today of dali today we have 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.889
 4 floods that did not restart the whole thing back 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:38.319
 the last time breast nostracom worse the time 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:43.559
 but good of the agriculture is gaining its space die its in that importance of 

00:05:43.559 --> 00:05:46.479
 hacienda is going cornered then well we have that in the set it 

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.330
 find him 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.949
 a puma goity nut theme 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.689
 well percent a brief balance of the day as they participate in an opponent 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:55.840
 also but like participating especially this day of management of low 

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.280
 not very satisfied, he showed very agreeable part the interest that avid for the 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:01.580
 percent producers more than 30 people 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.570
 percent that makes me well in comforting what we're in this for 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:11.039
 true in mind frames anívole críquet I repeat tolo boy network of ramiro carlitos 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.930
 percent have worked very well provided we have the doubt is stable 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.499
 so I have nothing but gratitude with that thank you very much 

00:06:18.499 --> 00:06:19.459
 now you are
