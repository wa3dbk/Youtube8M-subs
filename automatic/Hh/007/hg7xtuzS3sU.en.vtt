00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
but for this project I forced myself to

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:32.280 
but for this project I forced myself to
to<00:01:21.920> focus<00:01:22.310> on<00:01:22.490> the<00:01:22.640> physical<00:01:23.210> aspect

important part of the project because

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.400 
important part of the project because
often<00:02:52.750> I'm<00:02:53.290> used<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.739> work<00:02:54.330> the<00:02:55.330> stage<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.049> not

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
often I'm used to work the stage and not

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.850 
often I'm used to work the stage and not
only<00:02:56.560> dance<00:02:56.980> not<00:02:57.489> only<00:02:57.910> light<00:02:58.810> or<00:02:59.140> some<00:02:59.410> video

only dance not only light or some video

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.619 
only dance not only light or some video
it's<00:03:00.250> a<00:03:00.400> whole<00:03:00.610> at<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:00.790> same<00:03:01.060> time<00:03:01.330> and<00:03:01.830> it's

00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:03.629 
it's a whole at the same time and it's

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.740 
it's a whole at the same time and it's
there<00:03:04.629> is<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.750> kind<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.250> fusional<00:03:06.250> approach<00:03:06.790> of

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
there is a kind of fusional approach of

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.949 
there is a kind of fusional approach of
the<00:03:07.930> stage<00:03:08.200> and<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:09.489> also<00:03:09.730> a<00:03:10.269> certain<00:03:10.750> way<00:03:10.900> to

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
the stage and it's also a certain way to

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.289 
the stage and it's also a certain way to
walk<00:03:11.519> toward<00:03:12.519> the<00:03:12.579> dance<00:03:12.849> to<00:03:13.000> walk<00:03:13.120> the

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
walk toward the dance to walk the

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.960 
walk toward the dance to walk the
movement<00:03:13.690> and<00:03:14.110> that's<00:03:14.230> why<00:03:14.440> for<00:03:14.680> now<00:03:14.879> we<00:03:15.879> are

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:15.970 
movement and that's why for now we are

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:17.539 
movement and that's why for now we are
making<00:03:16.090> a<00:03:16.329> choreography<00:03:16.930> but<00:03:17.170> they<00:03:17.319> are<00:03:17.379> also

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:17.549 
making a choreography but they are also

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:21.390 
making a choreography but they are also
performing<00:03:18.549> a<00:03:18.849> concert<00:03:19.060> a<00:03:19.920> lot<00:03:20.920> of<00:03:21.069> the<00:03:21.190> thing

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
performing a concert a lot of the thing

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.880 
performing a concert a lot of the thing
that<00:03:21.579> they<00:03:21.700> are<00:03:21.819> doing<00:03:22.000> is<00:03:22.299> in<00:03:23.230> a<00:03:23.290> deep

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 
that they are doing is in a deep

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:42.410 
that they are doing is in a deep
relation<00:03:24.430> with<00:03:24.609> the<00:03:24.730> music

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.240 

what<00:03:43.420> inspires<00:03:43.930> me<00:03:44.260> most<00:03:44.380> at<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.680> moment<00:03:45.070> is

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
what inspires me most at the moment is

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.140 
what inspires me most at the moment is
when<00:03:45.490> he<00:03:45.610> talks<00:03:45.850> about<00:03:46.500> being<00:03:47.670> ultra<00:03:48.670> present

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
when he talks about being ultra present

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.810 
when he talks about being ultra present
and<00:03:50.310> really<00:03:51.310> simple<00:03:51.520> at<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.120> same<00:03:52.210> time<00:03:52.660> and

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
and really simple at the same time and

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:57.780 
and really simple at the same time and
we<00:03:54.820> as<00:03:55.180> a<00:03:55.240> group<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:56.050> think<00:03:56.410> can<00:03:57.220> really<00:03:57.490> sense

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
we as a group I think can really sense

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:14.459 
we as a group I think can really sense
when<00:03:58.480> it<00:03:58.600> happens

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:14.469 

00:04:14.469 --> 00:04:17.469 

the<00:04:15.469> way<00:04:15.590> he's<00:04:15.739> able<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.070> sort<00:04:16.489> of<00:04:16.549> put<00:04:17.359> that

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
the way he's able to sort of put that

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:20.830 
the way he's able to sort of put that
into<00:04:17.600> space<00:04:17.900> in<00:04:18.470> the<00:04:19.070> right<00:04:19.220> context<00:04:19.880> with<00:04:20.690> the

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:20.840 
into space in the right context with the

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.330 
into space in the right context with the
right<00:04:21.019> sound<00:04:22.000> we<00:04:23.000> add<00:04:23.150> something<00:04:23.509> really

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
right sound we add something really
