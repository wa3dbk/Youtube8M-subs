00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:10.690
 Such objects that have a structure called Tensegrity at Chiba University's Kasama laboratory 

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:16.810
 Implemented a support system for creating 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:21.250
 If it is a normal building, hard things and hard things are connected to make a shape, though 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.710
 In that structure called security , hard rods and hard rods collide with each other. 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.669
 Without 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.300
 Support the entire shape by tension with wire 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:31.439
 It is a structure 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.850
 I think this shape is very attractive but 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:40.020
 If it is difficult to design, it is also difficult to actually make it 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:44.490
 And and the support has been this time last week adopted the r 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.450
 This structure is made of a combination of Korean book rods called units . 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:51.690
 But 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:53.329
 This time with these three rod parts, with the help to make the parts accurate and using r 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.429
 is 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:01:03.530
 That is attached mark, such as the red target to the end points of the trot there be 8 y now 

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:04.500
 I think that you understand, but the thing with the blink is that the vertex is in the correct position 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.890
 Will be 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.110
 For example, here now 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 I think that I understand that the position is off, but I adjusted the position as I pulled somewhere 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.010
 I am 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.330
 Other places will be off next time 

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:24.260
 As a unit of body security is the subtleties of tension in the hearing Hawaiian 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:30.730
 There is here by pulling here because it is established in the balance 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:36.000
 But it is difficult for us to work together as if it is growing again 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.340
 In r Nyoro scene is so very hard because we do while achieving here 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.070
 I will 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:47.560
 We propose a method to make this while confirming that the whole image is correct 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:52.180
 Well this time Kedomo now I often used to taste it is the Toka art works 8 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:56.170
 We are proceeding with this arrest on whether it can be applied to architecture 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:02:00.130
 This, for example, were these to what such a Toka is the roof of the booth of this kind of hypothesis 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:04.720
 I think it is very attractive if the structure of tensegrity is used 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.560
 It will be a big dream, but it is also a pavilion of the Tokyo Olympics, etc. 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:11.250
 Think Fu that the Toka of Asia wonder if the roof is not the good-consuming and very parentheses 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.250
 I am
