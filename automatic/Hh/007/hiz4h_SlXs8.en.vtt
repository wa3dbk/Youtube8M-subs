00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 so for this 22nd race really started to get tough 

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.750
 when i show you a derrick may be more complicated than we can do 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.869
 with that kind of technique 

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:14.029
 and it sure does not stop with the rhythmic base in sixteenths 

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.310
 so that was often a complete plan tizi ouzou especially what for 

00:00:18.309 --> 00:00:23.069
 get rich tango to the afp astor piazolla a little tango milonga and so on 

00:00:23.829 --> 00:00:27.439
 so for that reason people use percent agreements of 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.629
 little chords that are quite interesting and that you have to hear a 

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:33.960
 little melody then I explain the pga corner 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.510
 the Alsatian verhulst of the minor 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
 the ideal second act that knows nothing 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.990
 the pace that I propose to you is if the money you play the the complete plan 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.990
 that's it 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 no but brothel so that's enough to this interesting case as 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:10.880
 a bit like rhythmic 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.230
 it's really a rhythmic is very complete and that also makes hear on 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.290
 small melodies the site 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.290
 who tells you mike the contest remember 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.420
 already we are going to focus on the left hand 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.590
 the left hand you are going to put 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.080
 on the ring 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.150
 over a year there 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.970
 fifth piece of steel 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.330
 Why 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:34.880
 then 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 you put the index on the second box 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.780
 the fourth corner 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.180
 and the little finger 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.640
 on the 5th store third body you forgot the the fifth body 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.480
 in fact should not have rung 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:53.260
 the directory slightly 60th sanson body for the merciless touch 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.070
 we divorced three notes 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.710
 from time to time we advance 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:02.760
 index 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.350
 and apparently the vase in place 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.610
 in savoy 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.519
 the interference of a malaise 

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.519
 I move back 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.109
 the second chord so it's a little simpler it's the same time the 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.359
 same time positions as soon as you want it's a place accent 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.649
 and you move back the two the other two must of a box so we have the directory 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:27.239
 sixth body fourth gas 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.239
 the discovery of these bad catherine cormier 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.439
 and the little finger for his fourth round 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:37.369
 in addition, a very worried range 

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.369
 and the security 

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.039
 even if it is on the combat index that we will advance so that 

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:50.219
 but before that, greece and then we come back on a corner 

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:04.549
 okay then that's for the left hand 

00:03:04.549 --> 00:03:07.759
 on the level of the right hand manon we will resume the rhythmic base 

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.759
 so that makes 

00:03:12.909 --> 00:03:15.140
 16 a little scared 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.599
 I did a little deeper 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:19.599
 23 14 

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:26.119
 we will start again 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:29.069
 in europe the same thing by removing all returns that's thirty 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:32.449
 Why 

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:35.449
 and if we played our chords it did that 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:44.949
 after I'm going to hear% 

00:03:44.949 --> 00:03:47.949
 the ubs pulled out i can make it sound right that the state pays 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.639
 and I'm going to hear back and forth 

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:18.959
 then we will add more returns but this time rosander 9 years thomas 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:22.629
 laymen have fallen all my fingers to get leaned on the strings 

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:24.990
 slightly behind 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.259
 so that's going to do that 

00:04:28.259 --> 00:04:30.099
 it 

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:31.969
 3 down 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:34.969
 at the final editing and party 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:42.879
 and there we change the childhood of agreement 

00:04:52.819 --> 00:04:55.819
 this refusal to type that does that 

00:05:02.629 --> 00:05:05.629
 we will change the agreement after going through sony 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:22.139
 and we can think of combining after the rhythm once we understand the 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:25.139
 principle we can add missing some couples 

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:57.089
 and that's why it's so very difficult 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:58.649
 orr courage for more
