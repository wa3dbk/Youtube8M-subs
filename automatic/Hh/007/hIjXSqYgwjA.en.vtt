so<00:02:45.349> you<00:02:45.440> can<00:02:45.530> expand<00:02:45.920> that<00:02:46.480> I'll<00:02:47.480> pull<00:02:47.659> up<00:02:47.690> the

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:50.920 
contacts application you see Carmen's
also<00:02:49.819> replace<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.360> so<00:02:50.569> there's<00:02:50.780> some

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
also replace that so there's some

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:56.589 
also replace that so there's some

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:58.099 
feels quite hard in spite of the fact

00:02:58.099 --> 00:02:59.770 
feels quite hard in spite of the fact
that<00:02:58.129> it's<00:02:58.310> resistive<00:02:58.790> it<00:02:58.970> feels<00:02:59.540> like<00:02:59.689> a

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
that it's resistive it feels like a

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:00.940 
that it's resistive it feels like a
capacitive<00:03:00.230> screen<00:03:00.470> but<00:03:00.590> it<00:03:00.680> is<00:03:00.769> definitely

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
capacitive screen but it is definitely

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.759 
capacitive screen but it is definitely
pressure-sensitive<00:03:02.290> say<00:03:03.290> it<00:03:03.440> works<00:03:03.590> with<00:03:03.739> a

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:03.769 
pressure-sensitive say it works with a

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:06.430 
pressure-sensitive say it works with a
fingernail<00:03:04.099> as<00:03:04.220> you<00:03:04.310> can<00:03:04.430> see<00:03:05.170> and<00:03:06.170> of<00:03:06.260> course

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
fingernail as you can see and of course

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.390 
fingernail as you can see and of course
if<00:03:06.500> you<00:03:06.560> don't<00:03:06.620> want<00:03:06.799> to<00:03:06.859> use<00:03:06.950> a<00:03:06.980> fingernail

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
if you don't want to use a fingernail

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.930 
if you don't want to use a fingernail
there<00:03:08.139> is<00:03:09.139> in<00:03:09.319> fact<00:03:09.530> a<00:03:09.799> stylus<00:03:10.400> here<00:03:10.549> so

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
there is in fact a stylus here so

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.309 
there is in fact a stylus here so
telescoping<00:03:13.450> stylus<00:03:14.450> it's<00:03:14.750> in<00:03:14.870> the<00:03:14.959> bottom<00:03:15.230> of

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:15.319 
telescoping stylus it's in the bottom of

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.940 
telescoping stylus it's in the bottom of
corner<00:03:15.790> so<00:03:16.790> it's<00:03:16.909> a<00:03:16.970> quick<00:03:17.120> look<00:03:17.359> at<00:03:17.569> the
