what I teach in class is all digital
based<00:00:18.359> because<00:00:18.779> that's<00:00:18.960> what<00:00:19.230> is<00:00:19.560> currently

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
based because that's what is currently

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.120 
based because that's what is currently
accessible<00:00:20.760> in<00:00:21.449> photojournalism<00:00:22.010> but<00:00:23.010> I<00:00:23.070> do

for myself is all analog there are

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.480 
for myself is all analog there are
issues<00:00:26.070> that<00:00:26.310> come<00:00:26.609> up<00:00:26.730> in<00:00:26.910> film<00:00:27.500> but<00:00:28.500> require

what<00:00:42.150> I'm<00:00:42.240> looking<00:00:42.540> at<00:00:42.630> is<00:00:42.930> a<00:00:43.050> test<00:00:43.470> that<00:00:43.590> I<00:00:43.740> ran

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
photographed because one of my projects

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.800

in<00:00:52.470> Kodak<00:00:53.370> has<00:00:53.400> recently<00:00:53.910> changed<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:54.450 
in Kodak has recently changed the

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.170 
in Kodak has recently changed the
formulation<00:00:55.200> of<00:00:55.230> their<00:00:56.100> emulsion<00:00:56.670> on<00:00:56.850> this

formulation of their emulsion on this

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.420 
formulation of their emulsion on this
one<00:00:57.390> film<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.990> I<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.650> on<00:00:58.800> their<00:00:58.980> test<00:00:59.190> team

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
one film and I was on their test team

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:00.890 
one film and I was on their test team
three<00:00:59.760> years<00:00:59.970> ago<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.360> they<00:01:00.450> changed<00:01:00.720> that

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
three years ago and they changed that

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.650 
three years ago and they changed that
same<00:01:01.320> formula<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.130> different<00:01:02.550> film<00:01:02.790> and<00:01:03.570> it

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
same formula for a different film and it

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.359 
same formula for a different film and it
came<00:01:03.840> up<00:01:03.900> so<00:01:04.199> it<00:01:04.260> was<00:01:04.409> better<00:01:04.619> for<00:01:04.739> the<00:01:04.979> daytime

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
came up so it was better for the daytime

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.370 
came up so it was better for the daytime
users<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.060> for<00:01:06.210> people<00:01:06.360> like<00:01:06.570> myself<00:01:06.810> doing

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
users and for people like myself doing

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.830 
users and for people like myself doing
this<00:01:07.590> sort<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.220> project<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:09.390> was<00:01:09.600> really

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
this sort of project it was really

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.100 
this sort of project it was really
problematic

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
problematic

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.070 
problematic
contrast<00:01:11.590> so<00:01:12.550> now<00:01:12.790> shut<00:01:13.360> up<00:01:13.390> arrow<00:01:13.690> pictures

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
contrast so now shut up arrow pictures

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.530 
contrast so now shut up arrow pictures
figured<00:01:14.680> out<00:01:14.800> the<00:01:15.040> way<00:01:15.850> to<00:01:15.910> develop<00:01:16.390> in

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
figured out the way to develop in

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:19.500 
figured out the way to develop in
between<00:01:16.900> them<00:01:17.760> develop<00:01:18.760> them<00:01:18.970> and<00:01:19.240> now<00:01:19.390> I'm

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
between them develop them and now I'm

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.670 
between them develop them and now I'm
just<00:01:19.660> trying<00:01:19.930> to<00:01:19.990> make<00:01:20.050> some<00:01:20.320> basic

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
just trying to make some basic

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.340 
just trying to make some basic
evaluations<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.610> see<00:01:21.850> which<00:01:22.660> is<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.990> sort<00:01:23.290> of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 
evaluations to see which is the sort of

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:25.410 
evaluations to see which is the sort of
image<00:01:23.560> is<00:01:23.770> going<00:01:24.070> to<00:01:24.160> work<00:01:24.280> first<00:01:24.610> it's<00:01:25.210> going

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:25.420 
image is going to work first it's going

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.020 
image is going to work first it's going
to<00:01:25.480> work<00:01:25.630> best<00:01:25.980> so<00:01:26.980> what<00:01:27.340> are<00:01:27.370> take<00:01:27.729> a<00:01:27.760> look<00:01:27.910> at

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.030 
to work best so what are take a look at

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.460 
to work best so what are take a look at
this<00:01:28.120> would<00:01:28.479> be<00:01:28.570> easier<00:01:28.840> to<00:01:28.900> see<00:01:29.170> if<00:01:29.290> I'm

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 
this would be easier to see if I'm

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.210 
this would be easier to see if I'm
pointing<00:01:30.310> it<00:01:30.520> out<00:01:30.610> directly<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:32.170> old<00:01:32.350> film<00:01:32.680> is

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
pointing it out directly the old film is

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.170 
pointing it out directly the old film is
this<00:01:33.490> is<00:01:33.670> here<00:01:34.440> see<00:01:35.440> my<00:01:36.430> student<00:01:36.760> Sean<00:01:36.970> was

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
this is here see my student Sean was

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.690 
this is here see my student Sean was
wearing<00:01:37.450> a<00:01:37.540> black<00:01:37.810> t-shirt<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:39.340> if<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.550> look

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
wearing a black t-shirt and if you look

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.730 
wearing a black t-shirt and if you look
at<00:01:39.820> this<00:01:40.000> you<00:01:40.420> can<00:01:40.570> see<00:01:40.750> it's<00:01:40.900> still<00:01:41.200> fairly

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
at this you can see it's still fairly

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.950 
at this you can see it's still fairly
gray<00:01:42.250> in<00:01:42.460> here<00:01:42.700> it's<00:01:42.850> not<00:01:43.030> completely<00:01:43.540> clear

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
gray in here it's not completely clear

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.080 
gray in here it's not completely clear
which<00:01:44.860> means<00:01:45.100> there's<00:01:45.340> a<00:01:45.369> little<00:01:45.520> density

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
which means there's a little density

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.640 
which means there's a little density
there<00:01:46.300> so<00:01:46.450> it'd<00:01:46.540> be<00:01:46.570> easier<00:01:46.930> for<00:01:46.960> me<00:01:47.200> to<00:01:47.290> print

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
there so it'd be easier for me to print

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.749 
there so it'd be easier for me to print
in<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.729> new<00:01:48.940> film<00:01:49.300> one<00:01:49.930> up<00:01:50.050> on<00:01:50.200> top<00:01:50.610> flip<00:01:51.610> it

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:51.759 
in the new film one up on top flip it

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.620 
in the new film one up on top flip it
around<00:01:52.890> look<00:01:53.890> at<00:01:54.009> how<00:01:54.130> clear<00:01:54.700> this<00:01:55.060> area<00:01:55.300> is

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
around look at how clear this area is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.770 
around look at how clear this area is
here<00:01:56.050> compared<00:01:56.619> to<00:01:56.710> this<00:01:56.890> I<00:01:57.479> suspect<00:01:58.479> this<00:01:58.600> is

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
here compared to this I suspect this is

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.480 
here compared to this I suspect this is
going<00:01:58.930> to<00:01:59.020> be<00:01:59.080> more<00:01:59.259> difficult<00:01:59.290> to<00:01:59.800> print<00:02:00.190> if<00:02:00.369> I

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
going to be more difficult to print if I

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.130 
going to be more difficult to print if I
was<00:02:00.640> a<00:02:00.700> typical<00:02:01.060> photographer<00:02:01.630> only<00:02:01.840> working

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
was a typical photographer only working

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.170 
was a typical photographer only working
in<00:02:02.229> daylight<00:02:02.590> issues<00:02:02.950> it<00:02:03.610> would<00:02:03.759> be<00:02:03.910> a<00:02:03.940> lot

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
in daylight issues it would be a lot

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.900 
in daylight issues it would be a lot
simpler<00:02:05.080> for<00:02:05.410> me<00:02:05.440> to<00:02:05.649> deal<00:02:05.830> with<00:02:06.009> this<00:02:06.190> but

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:06.910 
simpler for me to deal with this but

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.490 
simpler for me to deal with this but
since<00:02:07.090> I'm<00:02:07.240> a<00:02:07.270> nighttime<00:02:07.540> guy<00:02:07.960> and<00:02:08.259> I'm<00:02:08.350> doing

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
since I'm a nighttime guy and I'm doing

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.830 
since I'm a nighttime guy and I'm doing
a<00:02:08.679> special<00:02:08.890> process<00:02:09.280> with<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:09.910> I<00:02:10.149> think<00:02:10.720> it's

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
a special process with this I think it's

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.270 
a special process with this I think it's
going<00:02:10.929> to<00:02:11.020> be<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.170> lot<00:02:11.350> harder<00:02:11.620> for<00:02:11.920> me<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.070> get<00:02:12.220> a

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
going to be a lot harder for me to get a

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.550 
going to be a lot harder for me to get a
decent<00:02:12.520> print<00:02:12.970> out<00:02:13.120> of<00:02:13.270> this<00:02:13.510> than<00:02:14.230> out<00:02:14.410> of

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
decent print out of this than out of

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.759 
decent print out of this than out of
this<00:02:14.760> but<00:02:15.760> we'll<00:02:15.970> find<00:02:16.150> out<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:17.019> that's<00:02:17.230> that's

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
this but we'll find out so that's that's

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:19.140 
this but we'll find out so that's that's
why<00:02:17.950> I<00:02:17.980> need<00:02:18.160> to<00:02:18.220> be<00:02:18.280> working<00:02:18.459> on<00:02:18.610> the<00:02:18.670> next<00:02:18.940> day

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
why I need to be working on the next day

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.759 
why I need to be working on the next day
or<00:02:19.269> two<00:02:19.299> getting<00:02:19.930> in<00:02:20.019> the<00:02:20.110> darkroom<00:02:20.380> and

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
or two getting in the darkroom and

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.940 
or two getting in the darkroom and
physically<00:02:21.580> making<00:02:21.820> some<00:02:22.090> prints<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.510> bees

running<00:02:23.950> them<00:02:24.040> through<00:02:24.070> something<00:02:24.549> called<00:02:24.640> a

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
running them through something called a

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.820 
running them through something called a
densitometer<00:02:25.269> so<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.900> can<00:02:26.049> see<00:02:26.290> where<00:02:26.650> the

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
densitometer so I can see where the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.550 
densitometer so I can see where the
densities<00:02:27.280> fall<00:02:27.580> how<00:02:28.180> the<00:02:28.239> image<00:02:28.510> looks<00:02:28.630> in<00:02:29.080> in

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
densities fall how the image looks in in

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.260 
densities fall how the image looks in in

basically find out for itself whether

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.460 
basically find out for itself whether
I'm<00:02:33.340> happy<00:02:33.490> with<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:33.880> process<00:02:34.120> or<00:02:34.480> not<00:02:34.660> with

I'm happy with the process or not with

film people who still be filmed have to

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.730 
film people who still be filmed have to
go<00:02:55.630> about<00:02:55.870> what<00:02:56.050> they're<00:02:56.200> doing<00:02:56.230> by

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
go about what they're doing by

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.310 
go about what they're doing by
reinventing<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.490> continuously<00:02:58.140> someone<00:02:59.140> like

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
reinventing it continuously someone like

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.050 
reinventing it continuously someone like
Kodak<00:02:59.710> and<00:02:59.740> grateful<00:03:00.550> enough<00:03:00.730> that<00:03:00.910> they're

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
Kodak and grateful enough that they're

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.460 
Kodak and grateful enough that they're
out<00:03:01.180> there<00:03:01.420> but<00:03:01.600> when<00:03:02.020> they<00:03:02.140> change<00:03:02.350> their

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:02.470 
out there but when they change their

out there but when they change their
emulsion<00:03:03.100> it<00:03:03.610> becomes<00:03:03.970> problematic<00:03:04.240> from<00:03:04.720> I

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
emulsion it becomes problematic from I

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.380 
emulsion it becomes problematic from I
have<00:03:05.350> to<00:03:05.470> go<00:03:05.590> back<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:06.040> and<00:03:06.550> recreate<00:03:07.150> what<00:03:07.360> I

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:07.390 
have to go back in and recreate what I

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:09.450 
have to go back in and recreate what I
had<00:03:07.570> done<00:03:07.780> with<00:03:08.380> the<00:03:08.500> previous<00:03:08.920> emulsion

had done with the previous emulsion

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.130 
had done with the previous emulsion
which<00:03:09.970> means<00:03:10.210> i<00:03:10.390> need<00:03:10.420> to<00:03:10.660> formulate<00:03:10.930> my

department<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.810> a<00:03:19.840> lot<00:03:20.080> of<00:03:20.110> science<00:03:20.500> goes<00:03:20.680> into

it<00:03:21.070> I<00:03:21.220> try<00:03:21.400> not<00:03:21.520> to<00:03:21.580> talk<00:03:21.970> too<00:03:22.480> much<00:03:22.510> I<00:03:22.780> think

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
it I try not to talk too much I think

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.990 
it I try not to talk too much I think
about<00:03:23.200> it<00:03:23.350> but<00:03:23.530> it's<00:03:24.250> very<00:03:24.460> different<00:03:24.760> for

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
about it but it's very different for

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.180 
about it but it's very different for

to<00:03:34.810> photograph<00:03:35.350> with<00:03:35.910> actually<00:03:36.910> a<00:03:36.940> telephoto

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
to photograph with actually a telephoto

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:40.530 
to photograph with actually a telephoto
lens<00:03:37.900> so<00:03:38.800> I<00:03:38.830> get<00:03:39.310> a<00:03:39.520> lot<00:03:39.670> of<00:03:39.730> compression<00:03:40.390> from

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
lens so I get a lot of compression from

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.060 
lens so I get a lot of compression from
background<00:03:41.020> and<00:03:41.200> foreground<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.890> makes

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
background and foreground and makes

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.370 
background and foreground and makes
things<00:03:42.310> appear<00:03:42.760> closer<00:03:43.090> than<00:03:43.270> they<00:03:43.420> are<00:03:43.630> and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:44.380 
things appear closer than they are and

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.080 
things appear closer than they are and
yet<00:03:44.620> because<00:03:45.070> it's<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.610> large<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.060> negative

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
yet because it's a large and negative

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.200 
yet because it's a large and negative
I'm<00:03:46.690> taking<00:03:47.380> in<00:03:47.500> a<00:03:47.590> big<00:03:47.860> area<00:03:48.100> on<00:03:48.460> either<00:03:48.850> side

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:49.210 
I'm taking in a big area on either side

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:51.780 
I'm taking in a big area on either side
of<00:03:49.240> my<00:03:49.510> subject<00:03:50.020> so<00:03:50.800> I<00:03:50.830> photographed<00:03:51.430> this<00:03:51.580> guy

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:51.790 
of my subject so I photographed this guy

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:55.290 
of my subject so I photographed this guy
with<00:03:52.030> 180<00:03:52.660> millimeter<00:03:53.080> lens<00:03:53.790> which<00:03:54.790> in<00:03:54.970> normal

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
with 180 millimeter lens which in normal

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.650 
with 180 millimeter lens which in normal
terms<00:03:55.510> would<00:03:56.290> be<00:03:56.350> for<00:03:57.130> 35<00:03:57.850> millimeter<00:03:58.270> cameras

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
terms would be for 35 millimeter cameras

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.350 
terms would be for 35 millimeter cameras
a<00:03:58.840> medium<00:03:59.500> telephoto<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:00.790> on<00:04:00.880> the<00:04:01.000> camera

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:01.360 
a medium telephoto but on the camera

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.180 
a medium telephoto but on the camera
that<00:04:01.450> I<00:04:01.510> use<00:04:01.810> it's<00:04:02.170> actually<00:04:02.680> an<00:04:02.770> extreme

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
that I use it's actually an extreme

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.580 
that I use it's actually an extreme
wide-angle<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.480> I<00:04:04.510> get<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.810> wide-angle<00:04:05.050> point

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
wide-angle so I get the wide-angle point

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.200 
wide-angle so I get the wide-angle point
of<00:04:05.680> view<00:04:05.890> with<00:04:06.340> an<00:04:06.520> impression<00:04:07.060> of<00:04:07.150> a

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:07.210 
of view with an impression of a

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.810 
of view with an impression of a
telephoto<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.080> for<00:04:08.560> that<00:04:08.650> reason<00:04:08.710> largely<00:04:09.670> I

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:09.820 
telephoto and for that reason largely I

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.260 
telephoto and for that reason largely I
stuck<00:04:10.330> with<00:04:10.650> analog<00:04:11.650> media<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:12.670> also<00:04:12.790> issues

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
stuck with analog media and also issues

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:15.480 
stuck with analog media and also issues
of<00:04:13.420> detail<00:04:13.750> a<00:04:14.080> lot<00:04:14.470> of<00:04:14.560> people<00:04:14.800> come<00:04:14.920> up<00:04:15.070> with<00:04:15.280> a

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
of detail a lot of people come up with a

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.460 
of detail a lot of people come up with a
new<00:04:15.850> camera<00:04:16.120> in<00:04:16.299> the<00:04:16.390> same<00:04:16.600> this<00:04:16.930> gets<00:04:17.170> an

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
new camera in the same this gets an

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:19.979 
new camera in the same this gets an
eight<00:04:17.680> make<00:04:17.890> appt<00:04:18.220> sure<00:04:18.459> that's<00:04:19.060> nice<00:04:19.390> this

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:19.989 
eight make appt sure that's nice this

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.740 
eight make appt sure that's nice this
gets<00:04:20.200> a<00:04:20.320> six<00:04:20.620> get<00:04:20.980> capture<00:04:21.730> so<00:04:22.420> it's<00:04:22.600> not

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
gets a six get capture so it's not

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.290 
gets a six get capture so it's not
anywhere<00:04:23.080> close<00:04:23.140> in<00:04:23.590> that<00:04:23.820> I'm<00:04:24.820> just<00:04:25.060> hoping

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
anywhere close in that I'm just hoping

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.760 
anywhere close in that I'm just hoping
the<00:04:25.390> digital<00:04:25.750> media<00:04:25.990> will<00:04:26.140> continue<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.620> catch

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
the digital media will continue to catch

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.100 
the digital media will continue to catch
up<00:04:27.040> I<00:04:27.280> expect<00:04:27.790> they<00:04:27.880> will<00:04:28.030> filter<00:04:28.570> by<00:04:28.750> the<00:04:28.810> time

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
up I expect they will filter by the time

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.080 
up I expect they will filter by the time
the<00:04:29.320> film<00:04:29.590> stuff<00:04:29.860> is<00:04:30.190> gone<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:30.850> can<00:04:31.000> no

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
the film stuff is gone and I can no

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.310 
the film stuff is gone and I can no
longer<00:04:31.300> work<00:04:31.540> in<00:04:31.750> it<00:04:31.870> there<00:04:32.200> will<00:04:32.290> be

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
longer work in it there will be

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.530 
longer work in it there will be
appropriate<00:04:33.190> replacement<00:04:33.490> farming<00:04:34.210> in<00:04:34.390> the
