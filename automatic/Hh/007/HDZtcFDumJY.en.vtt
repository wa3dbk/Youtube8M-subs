find on any other controller all right
first<00:01:27.150> things<00:01:27.390> first<00:01:27.630> we<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.610> on<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.790> unit

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
first things first we have on this unit

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.660 
first things first we have on this unit
we<00:01:30.270> have<00:01:30.299> MPC<00:01:31.049> pads<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:32.070> pretty<00:01:32.280> simple<00:01:32.549> but

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
we have MPC pads it's pretty simple but

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.780 
we have MPC pads it's pretty simple but
we<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.720> chi<00:01:34.290> we<00:01:34.710> releases<00:01:35.250> for<00:01:35.490> m<00:01:35.579> audio

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
we are a chi we releases for m audio

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
we are a chi we releases for m audio
we're<00:01:36.329> new<00:01:36.479> mark<00:01:36.720> we're<00:01:36.869> all<00:01:37.020> these<00:01:37.200> different

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
we're new mark we're all these different

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.230 
we're new mark we're all these different
companies<00:01:37.950> we<00:01:38.400> make<00:01:38.610> all<00:01:38.790> the<00:01:38.880> products

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
companies we make all the products

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.730 
companies we make all the products
ourselves<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.780> can<00:01:40.020> actually<00:01:40.140> grab<00:01:40.500> some

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
ourselves so we can actually grab some

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.889 
ourselves so we can actually grab some
MPC<00:01:41.130> pads<00:01:41.369> throw<00:01:42.030> them<00:01:42.119> on<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.240> DJ<00:01:42.540> controller

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
MPC pads throw them on a DJ controller

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.980 
MPC pads throw them on a DJ controller
so<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.259> the<00:01:43.350> same<00:01:43.590> field<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.659> the<00:01:45.659> typical

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
so it has the same field as the typical

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.420 
so it has the same field as the typical
MPC<00:01:46.350> pad<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.649> you're<00:01:46.799> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:46.979> find<00:01:47.159> on<00:01:47.310> an

MPC pad that you're going to find on an

MVC but now it's built into your DJ
controller<00:01:50.070> that's<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.850> first<00:01:51.090> thing

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
controller that's the first thing

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.350 
controller that's the first thing
they're<00:01:51.990> also<00:01:52.460> velocity-sensitive<00:01:53.460> which

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
they're also velocity-sensitive which

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
they're also velocity-sensitive which
means<00:01:54.600> if<00:01:54.750> i<00:01:54.810> have<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.990> sample<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:55.649> can

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
means if i have a sample on it i can

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:57.230 
means if i have a sample on it i can
change<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.159> volume<00:01:56.280> by<00:01:56.640> how<00:01:56.790> hard<00:01:57.090> that

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
change the volume by how hard that

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.620 
change the volume by how hard that

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.440 
to change my effect over here to be
something<00:04:44.490> a<00:04:44.550> little<00:04:44.790> bit<00:04:45.120> more<00:04:45.270> interesting

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
something a little bit more interesting

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.340 
something a little bit more interesting
so<00:04:45.780> we'll<00:04:45.930> take<00:04:46.050> that<00:04:47.600> and<00:04:48.600> when<00:04:48.870> I<00:04:48.900> go<00:04:49.080> to<00:04:49.110> turn

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
so we'll take that and when I go to turn

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:58.720 
so we'll take that and when I go to turn

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.160
