00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
few feet although ground pound is very

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.969 
few feet although ground pound is very
useful<00:05:33.479> as<00:05:33.690> we<00:05:33.930> said<00:05:34.139> before<00:05:34.260> it<00:05:34.590> is<00:05:34.620> quite

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:34.979 
useful as we said before it is quite

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:36.920 
useful as we said before it is quite
difficult<00:05:35.190> to<00:05:35.490> use<00:05:35.880> you<00:05:36.330> still<00:05:36.570> take<00:05:36.780> some

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:36.930 
difficult to use you still take some

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.750 
difficult to use you still take some
damage<00:05:37.169> why<00:05:37.470> in<00:05:37.530> the<00:05:37.680> ground<00:05:37.919> pound<00:05:38.190> animation

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:38.760 
damage why in the ground pound animation

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.029 
damage why in the ground pound animation
so<00:05:39.000> it<00:05:39.120> is<00:05:39.210> not<00:05:39.389> recommended<00:05:39.720> why<00:05:40.410> being<00:05:40.680> weak

00:05:41.029 --> 00:05:41.039 
so it is not recommended why being weak

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.379 
so it is not recommended why being weak
it<00:05:41.310> is<00:05:41.430> one<00:05:41.580> of<00:05:41.610> those<00:05:41.700> abilities<00:05:42.150> that<00:05:42.270> you

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
it is one of those abilities that you

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.060 
it is one of those abilities that you
just<00:05:42.539> kind<00:05:42.690> of<00:05:42.780> want<00:05:42.960> to<00:05:43.020> use<00:05:43.260> if<00:05:43.470> you<00:05:43.680> see<00:05:43.919> the

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
just kind of want to use if you see the
