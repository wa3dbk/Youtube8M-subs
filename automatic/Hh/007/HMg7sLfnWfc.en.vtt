catching<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.280> the<00:00:41.340> backfield<00:00:41.610> so<00:00:42.149> i'm

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
catching in the backfield so i'm

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.510

heyward-bey heap I really won't do much
but<00:01:00.750> I'm<00:01:00.870> hoping<00:01:01.230> maybe<00:01:01.800> my<00:01:02.160> opponent<00:01:02.850> will

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
but I'm hoping maybe my opponent will

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.640 
but I'm hoping maybe my opponent will
put<00:01:03.180> a<00:01:03.210> linebacker<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.989> him<00:01:04.140> when<00:01:04.260> he's<00:01:04.350> in<00:01:04.530> the

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
put a linebacker on him when he's in the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.990 
put a linebacker on him when he's in the
slot<00:01:04.920> I'll<00:01:05.159> just<00:01:05.369> streak<00:01:05.610> them<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.880> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
slot I'll just streak them down the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
slot I'll just streak them down the
field<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.450> that's<00:01:06.960> really<00:01:07.140> the<00:01:07.260> only<00:01:07.350> way

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
field and that's really the only way

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:08.660 
field and that's really the only way
he's<00:01:07.680> gonna<00:01:07.740> catch<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.189> ball<00:01:08.340> anyways

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
he's gonna catch the ball anyways

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.130 
he's gonna catch the ball anyways
because<00:01:08.850> this<00:01:09.090> catch<00:01:09.360> in<00:01:09.570> traffic<00:01:09.600> is

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
because this catch in traffic is

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.380 
because this catch in traffic is
absolutely<00:01:10.650> awful<00:01:10.830> so<00:01:11.430> Darius<00:01:12.240> heyward-bey
