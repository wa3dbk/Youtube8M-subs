as<00:00:30.330> far<00:00:30.390> as<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:30.900> concerned<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.529> I've<00:00:31.679> told

as far as I'm concerned and I've told
the<00:00:32.099> story<00:00:32.130> several<00:00:33.090> hundred<00:00:33.540> times<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.469> seems

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
the story several hundred times it seems

there's<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.980> certain<00:00:38.340> level<00:00:38.520> of<00:00:38.790> irony<00:00:39.329> because

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
there's a certain level of irony because

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.380 
there's a certain level of irony because
it<00:00:39.930> wasn't<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.379> first<00:00:40.680> route<00:00:41.160> to<00:00:41.430> put<00:00:41.670> up<00:00:41.850> it

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
it wasn't the first route to put up it

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.680 
it wasn't the first route to put up it
was<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:42.570> second<00:00:45.500> it's<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.680> nickel

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:47.690 
was a second it's a nickel

was a second it's a nickel
none<00:00:48.690> of<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.930> pitches<00:00:49.410> are<00:00:49.890> terribly<00:00:50.489> long

has its own character in nature it's a

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.959 
has its own character in nature it's a
wonderful<00:00:58.680> round<00:00:58.949> how<00:00:59.250> many<00:00:59.430> times<00:00:59.670> have<00:00:59.910> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
wonderful round how many times have I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.520 
wonderful round how many times have I
climbed<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.719> don't<00:01:00.899> know<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:00.989> guess<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> best

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
climbed it I don't know I guess the best

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.529 
climbed it I don't know I guess the best
answer<00:01:01.710> is<00:01:01.949> not<00:01:02.280> enough<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:03.149> I<00:01:03.270> still

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
answer is not enough because I still

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:15.380 
answer is not enough because I still
keep<00:01:03.719> climbing<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:13.670> you<00:01:14.670> get<00:01:14.850> the<00:01:14.970> ball<00:01:15.180> and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
keep climbing it you get the ball and

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.039 
keep climbing it you get the ball and
Ally<00:01:15.540> pitch<00:01:15.990> as<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> warm-up<00:01:16.799> pitch<00:01:17.720> then<00:01:18.720> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Ally pitch as a warm-up pitch then the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.210 
Ally pitch as a warm-up pitch then the
to<00:01:19.259> business<00:01:19.740> pitches<00:01:21.500> leaning<00:01:22.500> column<00:01:22.950> and

to business pitches leaning column and

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:32.170 
to business pitches leaning column and
the<00:01:23.580> infamous<00:01:23.970> turns<00:01:24.390> attract<00:01:24.720> our<00:01:24.930> next

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:35.030 

it's<00:01:33.180> probably<00:01:33.690> one<00:01:33.869> of<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.110> shorter<00:01:34.560> pitches

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
it's probably one of the shorter pitches

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.920 
it's probably one of the shorter pitches
on<00:01:35.299> climb<00:01:36.299> maybe<00:01:36.630> 60<00:01:37.200> feet<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:38.270> you<00:01:39.270> got<00:01:39.479> two

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
on climb maybe 60 feet and you got two

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.850 
on climb maybe 60 feet and you got two
cracks<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.979> in<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:42.060> day<00:01:42.330> and<00:01:42.360> age<00:01:42.710> it's<00:01:43.710> a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
cracks and in this day and age it's a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.789 
cracks and in this day and age it's a
kind<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.220> climbing<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.759> you<00:01:45.210> can't<00:01:46.140> find<00:01:46.500> in

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
kind of climbing that you can't find in

00:01:46.799 --> 00:02:03.490 
kind of climbing that you can't find in
the<00:01:46.890> gym<00:01:58.670> and<00:01:59.780> then<00:02:00.780> from<00:02:01.050> there<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:01.680> top

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
the gym and then from there to the top

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
the gym and then from there to the top
the<00:02:04.500> ledges<00:02:04.950> get<00:02:05.130> bigger<00:02:05.690> climbing<00:02:06.690> gets

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
the ledges get bigger climbing gets

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:27.320 
the ledges get bigger climbing gets
easier<00:02:07.320> you<00:02:07.590> got

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:36.979 

okay<00:02:28.330> don't<00:02:28.600> worry
