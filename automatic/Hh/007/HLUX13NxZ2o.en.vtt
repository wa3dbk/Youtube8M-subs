out of the way nothing major
it's<00:01:10.670> a<00:01:11.590> just<00:01:12.590> a<00:01:12.710> mousepad<00:01:14.649> so<00:01:15.649> it's<00:01:16.070> a<00:01:16.280> it's

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
it's a just a mousepad so it's a it's

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.200 
it's a just a mousepad so it's a it's
advertised<00:01:17.180> for<00:01:17.390> pro<00:01:18.290> gaming<00:01:19.000> super<00:01:20.000> durable

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:25.039 
rubber it's designed with non-slip

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.630 
rubber it's designed with non-slip
rubber<00:01:25.190> and<00:01:25.789> it's<00:01:26.509> about<00:01:27.190> nine<00:01:28.190> point<00:01:28.490> eight

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640

rubber and it's about nine point eight
inches<00:01:28.940> by<00:01:29.000> eight<00:01:29.300> point<00:01:29.539> two<00:01:29.600> and<00:01:30.050> that

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
inches by eight point two and that

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.980

that's<00:01:30.530> 250<00:01:31.369> millimeters<00:01:31.850> by<00:01:32.060> 210

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:32.990 
that's 250 millimeters by 210

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:52.179 
that's 250 millimeters by 210
millimeters<00:01:33.610> so<00:01:34.610> let's<00:01:34.789> go<00:01:34.970> ahead<00:01:35.060> and<00:01:35.360> open

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.899 

so<00:01:52.780> here's<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:53.960> mousepad<00:01:54.140> right<00:01:54.649> here<00:01:54.920> it's<00:01:55.670> a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
so here's the mousepad right here it's a

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.709 
so here's the mousepad right here it's a
it's<00:01:55.939> very<00:01:56.270> basic<00:01:57.460> it's<00:01:58.460> a<00:01:58.700> small<00:01:59.030> I<00:01:59.210> was<00:01:59.479> gonna

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
it's very basic it's a small I was gonna

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:02.649 
it's very basic it's a small I was gonna
get<00:01:59.929> the<00:02:00.079> qck<00:02:00.950> plus<00:02:01.340> but<00:02:02.119> that's<00:02:02.299> a<00:02:02.390> little<00:02:02.539> bit

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
get the qck plus but that's a little bit

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:04.690 
get the qck plus but that's a little bit
that's<00:02:02.960> that<00:02:03.710> mousepad<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.250> a<00:02:04.280> little<00:02:04.460> bit<00:02:04.549> too

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
that's that mousepad is a little bit too

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.580 
that's that mousepad is a little bit too
big<00:02:04.939> for<00:02:04.969> my<00:02:05.240> taste<00:02:05.569> I'm<00:02:05.659> not<00:02:05.810> a<00:02:05.840> fan<00:02:06.200> of<00:02:06.229> the

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
big for my taste I'm not a fan of the

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.309 
big for my taste I'm not a fan of the
huge<00:02:07.130> mouse<00:02:07.340> pads<00:02:07.700> I<00:02:08.060> like<00:02:08.569> a<00:02:08.599> mousepad<00:02:08.840> that's

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
huge mouse pads I like a mousepad that's

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.920 
huge mouse pads I like a mousepad that's
pretty<00:02:09.709> small<00:02:10.039> pretty<00:02:10.310> maneuverable<00:02:10.879> and<00:02:11.120> I

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
pretty small pretty maneuverable and I

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.979 
pretty small pretty maneuverable and I
just<00:02:12.830> like<00:02:13.010> this<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.430> because<00:02:13.700> it's<00:02:14.480> basic

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:14.989 
just like this one because it's basic

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.220 
just like this one because it's basic
it's<00:02:15.230> nice<00:02:15.500> and<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:17.450> texture<00:02:17.810> officer<00:02:18.019> feels

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
it's nice and the texture officer feels

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.770 
it's nice and the texture officer feels
quite<00:02:18.470> good<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.980> it<00:02:19.190> and<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:20.299> bottom<00:02:20.480> is

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
quite good on it and the bottom is

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.619 
quite good on it and the bottom is
actually<00:02:20.900> very<00:02:21.489> it<00:02:22.489> has<00:02:22.549> a<00:02:22.700> lot<00:02:22.970> of<00:02:23.000> grip<00:02:23.299> like

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:23.629 
actually very it has a lot of grip like

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.210 
actually very it has a lot of grip like
I<00:02:23.750> can<00:02:23.900> barely<00:02:24.140> get<00:02:24.290> my<00:02:24.349> hand<00:02:24.620> across<00:02:24.739> it<00:02:24.920> just

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
I can barely get my hand across it just

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.210 
I can barely get my hand across it just
doing<00:02:25.489> this<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.900> that's<00:02:27.079> quite<00:02:28.010> good<00:02:29.890> so<00:02:30.890> I'll

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
doing this so that's quite good so I'll

00:02:31.220 --> 00:05:05.820 
doing this so that's quite good so I'll
be<00:02:31.340> right<00:02:31.489> back<00:02:31.700> with<00:02:33.370> testing

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.380 

so<00:05:06.400> this<00:05:06.670> is<00:05:06.820> really<00:05:07.300> just<00:05:07.330> a<00:05:09.090> slip<00:05:10.090> test

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
so this is really just a slip test

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:17.600 
so this is really just a slip test
between<00:05:11.430> the<00:05:13.050> SteelSeries<00:05:14.050> qck<00:05:14.710> meeting<00:05:15.070> and

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:17.610 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:21.540 

really<00:05:18.610> my<00:05:19.270> old<00:05:19.510> nose<00:05:19.780> so<00:05:20.200> let's<00:05:20.440> just<00:05:20.650> get<00:05:21.520> a

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:21.550 
really my old nose so let's just get a

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.620 
really my old nose so let's just get a
quick<00:05:21.760> comparison<00:05:23.340> so<00:05:24.340> this<00:05:24.550> is<00:05:24.760> the<00:05:25.090> actually

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:25.630 
quick comparison so this is the actually

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:28.740 
quick comparison so this is the actually
I'm<00:05:25.900> sure<00:05:25.960> the<00:05:26.200> whole<00:05:26.290> mouth<00:05:26.500> first<00:05:27.600> this<00:05:28.600> is

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:28.750 
I'm sure the whole mouth first this is

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.780 
I'm sure the whole mouth first this is
the<00:05:28.870> old<00:05:29.050> mouse<00:05:29.290> so<00:05:30.070> with<00:05:30.310> the<00:05:30.400> old<00:05:30.550> mouse

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
the old mouse so with the old mouse

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.700 
the old mouse so with the old mouse
there's<00:05:31.060> a<00:05:31.120> lot<00:05:31.390> of<00:05:31.540> slip<00:05:31.780> I'm<00:05:31.990> barely<00:05:32.200> pushing

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710 
there's a lot of slip I'm barely pushing

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.490 
there's a lot of slip I'm barely pushing
on<00:05:32.830> it<00:05:33.010> and<00:05:33.190> this<00:05:33.370> is<00:05:33.520> what<00:05:33.670> happened<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:35.290> just

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
on it and this is what happened it just
