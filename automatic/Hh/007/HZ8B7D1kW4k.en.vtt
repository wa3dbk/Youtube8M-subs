00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:09.049
 we won the 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.439
 in the world 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.390
 the world 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 a wall 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.230
 washington 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.690
 tomorrow 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.280
 it's him 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.330
 I always liked 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:53.330
 when it happens 

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:12.749
 in other areas 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 who also 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:18.219
 about three years ago 

00:02:18.219 --> 00:02:20.719
 have to leave them 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:21.999
 What do we want? 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.529
 these artists 

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:25.809
 in this sense 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:29.009
 both press the apothecary 

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:32.009
 stf 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.579
 so many others 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:45.669
 - I was 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:58.919
 and I'll do 

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.020
 our part 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:03.830
 will be 

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:06.830
 if it succeeds 

00:05:27.789 --> 00:05:30.789
 vice 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.319
 but the defense 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:43.979
 every game is a battle 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:46.729
 he happened 

00:05:46.729 --> 00:05:48.240
 we want with this law 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.509
 the autarchy 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:52.509
 so now 

00:06:30.029 --> 00:06:33.029
 but 

00:06:35.499 --> 00:06:38.499
 she 

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:53.430
 Paulo 

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:08.139
 transparency 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:29.680
 he 

00:07:39.099 --> 00:07:42.099
 Paulo 

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.360
 to celebrate the date 

00:07:55.069 --> 00:07:58.069

00:07:58.069 --> 00:07:58.759
