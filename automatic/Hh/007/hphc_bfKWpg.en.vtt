00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
I've got some same kind of steel that I

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.640 
I've got some same kind of steel that I
had<00:00:26.820> from<00:00:27.180> making<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> C<00:00:28.019> notches<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.470> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
had from making the C notches but this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.060 
had from making the C notches but this
is<00:00:29.060> basically<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.150> 2x4<00:00:31.250> this<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.489> eighth<00:00:32.790> inch

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
is basically a 2x4 this is eighth inch

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.160 
is basically a 2x4 this is eighth inch
steel<00:00:35.070> not<00:00:35.399> quarter<00:00:35.880> but<00:00:36.300> it's<00:00:36.450> enough<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.989> do

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
steel not quarter but it's enough to do

on<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:44.040> backside<00:00:44.250> of<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:45.450> C<00:00:45.660> notch<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:47.809> then

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:49.129 
on the backside of the C notch and then

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.180 
on the backside of the C notch and then
using<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.219> same<00:00:50.430> steel<00:00:50.820> I'm<00:00:51.090> making<00:00:52.190> half

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
using the same steel I'm making half

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.740 
using the same steel I'm making half
boxes<00:00:53.730> frames<00:00:54.539> and<00:00:55.190> these<00:00:56.390> will<00:00:57.390> go<00:00:57.570> right

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
boxes frames and these will go right

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:04.399 
boxes frames and these will go right
here<00:00:59.059> to<00:01:00.059> create<00:01:01.550> my<00:01:02.550> upper<00:01:02.879> bag<00:01:03.059> map<00:01:03.350> now<00:01:04.350> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
here to create my upper bag map now the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
here to create my upper bag map now the
way<00:01:04.589> I've<00:01:04.710> got<00:01:04.739> this<00:01:05.070> set<00:01:05.129> up<00:01:05.659> because<00:01:06.659> of<00:01:06.750> the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
way I've got this set up because of the

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.530 
way I've got this set up because of the
rims<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.229> I<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.700> it's<00:01:08.700> basically<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.390> a

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
rims that I have it's basically only a

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.440 
rims that I have it's basically only a
three-inch<00:01:10.080> step<00:01:10.439> up<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:11.549> 3-inch<00:01:11.939> step<00:01:12.240> up

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
three-inch step up the 3-inch step up

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.560 
three-inch step up the 3-inch step up
will<00:01:12.659> allow<00:01:12.960> me<00:01:13.229> to<00:01:13.260> lay<00:01:13.590> frame<00:01:14.180> with<00:01:15.180> about<00:01:15.450> an

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
will allow me to lay frame with about an

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.480 
will allow me to lay frame with about an
inch<00:01:16.070> of<00:01:17.070> space<00:01:17.790> between<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.200> axle<00:01:19.710> and<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
inch of space between the axle and the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.359 
inch of space between the axle and the
bottom<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.060> C<00:01:21.299> notch<00:01:21.770> so<00:01:22.770> when<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.009> axle

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
bottom of that C notch so when the axle

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.929 
bottom of that C notch so when the axle
comes<00:01:23.580> up<00:01:24.320> they'll<00:01:25.320> be<00:01:25.409> an<00:01:25.500> inch<00:01:25.770> from<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.790> C

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
comes up they'll be an inch from the C

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.880 
comes up they'll be an inch from the C
notch<00:01:27.119> what<00:01:27.810> that<00:01:27.960> allows<00:01:28.259> me<00:01:28.290> is<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.799> the

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
notch what that allows me is on the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.120 
notch what that allows me is on the
inside<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.520> allows<00:01:29.759> me<00:01:30.740> about<00:01:31.740> three<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.040> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
inside it allows me about three and a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.270 
inside it allows me about three and a
half<00:01:32.310> inches<00:01:32.759> of<00:01:32.970> space<00:01:33.960> to<00:01:34.829> be<00:01:34.920> able<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.130> put

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
so and that'll be how my setup is going

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.460 
so and that'll be how my setup is going
to<00:02:14.990> be<00:02:15.110> this<00:02:15.830> will<00:02:15.980> also<00:02:16.190> allow<00:02:17.170> basically<00:02:18.170> a

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
to be this will also allow basically a

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.620 
to be this will also allow basically a
square<00:02:18.830> cut<00:02:19.070> out<00:02:19.220> spot<00:02:19.610> for<00:02:20.000> my<00:02:20.090> upper<00:02:20.420> for

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:20.630 
square cut out spot for my upper for

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:22.990 
square cut out spot for my upper for
length<00:02:20.810> bars<00:02:21.050> to<00:02:22.040> be<00:02:22.190> able<00:02:22.430> to<00:02:22.520> get<00:02:22.670> in<00:02:22.820> there

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
length bars to be able to get in there

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.140 
length bars to be able to get in there
once<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:23.870> upper<00:02:24.110> for<00:02:24.350> length<00:02:24.530> bars<00:02:24.910> come<00:02:25.910> up

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
once the upper for length bars come up

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:30.850 
once the upper for length bars come up
they'll<00:02:26.900> miss<00:02:27.260> these<00:02:28.160> two<00:02:28.460> also<00:02:29.650> the<00:02:30.650> other

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
they'll miss these two also the other

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.740 
they'll miss these two also the other
square<00:02:31.610> that<00:02:31.730> imma<00:02:31.910> put<00:02:32.090> in<00:02:32.180> on<00:02:32.360> this<00:02:32.510> side

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
square that imma put in on this side

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.470 
square that imma put in on this side
will<00:02:33.350> also<00:02:33.709> serve<00:02:34.010> as<00:02:34.040> the<00:02:34.340> new<00:02:34.850> tank<00:02:35.180> mount

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
will also serve as the new tank mount

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.930 
will also serve as the new tank mount
once<00:02:35.930> I<00:02:36.110> get<00:02:36.320> it<00:02:36.440> up<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.740> tank<00:02:36.980> mount<00:02:37.220> will<00:02:37.790> be

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
once I get it up the tank mount will be

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.490 
once I get it up the tank mount will be
able<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.209> bolt<00:02:38.420> straight<00:02:38.780> up<00:02:38.930> to<00:02:39.110> the<00:02:39.230> end<00:02:39.380> of

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
able to bolt straight up to the end of

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.220 
able to bolt straight up to the end of
that<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.950> that'll<00:02:40.880> allow<00:02:40.910> me<00:02:41.480> to<00:02:41.660> get<00:02:41.780> my<00:02:41.959> tank

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
that and that'll allow me to get my tank

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:44.830 
that and that'll allow me to get my tank
up<00:02:42.470> higher<00:02:42.860> so<00:02:43.220> the<00:02:44.060> end<00:02:44.180> event<00:02:44.480> that<00:02:44.690> I<00:02:44.720> do

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
up higher so the end event that I do

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.760 
up higher so the end event that I do
drag<00:02:45.620> or<00:02:45.950> if<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:46.940> I<00:02:47.180> decide<00:02:47.540> to<00:02:47.570> my<00:02:48.350> tank<00:02:48.620> will

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:48.770 
drag or if if I decide to my tank will

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:51.790 
drag or if if I decide to my tank will
actually<00:02:49.100> be<00:02:49.280> relocated<00:02:50.090> up<00:02:50.530> about<00:02:51.530> three

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
actually be relocated up about three

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.770 
actually be relocated up about three
inches<00:02:52.070> from<00:02:52.130> where<00:02:52.520> it<00:02:52.610> was<00:02:52.880> not<00:02:53.300> the<00:02:53.450> front

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
inches from where it was not the front

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.229 
inches from where it was not the front
but<00:02:54.080> the<00:02:54.200> rear<00:02:54.500> and<00:02:54.770> usually<00:02:55.160> you're<00:02:55.400> lowering

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
but the rear and usually you're lowering

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:58.180 
but the rear and usually you're lowering
your<00:02:56.480> rear<00:02:56.780> down<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:57.530> ground<00:02:57.680> to<00:02:57.950> drag

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
your rear down to the ground to drag

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.880 
your rear down to the ground to drag
anyway<00:02:58.580> so<00:02:58.640> therefore<00:02:59.360> my<00:03:00.170> tank<00:03:00.530> will<00:03:00.680> be<00:03:00.709> up

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
anyway so therefore my tank will be up

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.580 
anyway so therefore my tank will be up
off<00:03:01.040> the<00:03:01.160> ground<00:03:01.810> enough<00:03:02.810> explanation<00:03:03.110> that's

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:03.590 
off the ground enough explanation that's

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:05.080 
off the ground enough explanation that's
three<00:03:03.800> minutes<00:03:04.100> I'm<00:03:04.370> sure<00:03:04.550> you're<00:03:04.700> bored<00:03:04.910> by

with two different it comes with two
tank<00:03:32.989> mounts<00:03:33.400> so<00:03:34.400> all<00:03:34.459> I<00:03:34.580> did<00:03:34.760> was<00:03:34.850> I<00:03:34.970> cut<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
tank mounts so all I did was I cut the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.920 
tank mounts so all I did was I cut the
one<00:03:35.480> off<00:03:35.690> that<00:03:36.140> way<00:03:36.320> that<00:03:37.310> can<00:03:37.549> go<00:03:37.670> up<00:03:37.910> into<00:03:38.209> my

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
one off that way that can go up into my

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:42.340 
one off that way that can go up into my
bag<00:03:39.320> mount<00:03:39.620> now<00:03:39.799> I<00:03:39.830> left<00:03:40.160> an<00:03:40.940> inch<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.780> room<00:03:42.079> all

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:42.350 
bag mount now I left an inch of room all

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.440 
bag mount now I left an inch of room all
the<00:03:42.470> way<00:03:42.500> around<00:03:42.799> my<00:03:42.890> bag<00:03:43.130> so<00:03:44.060> that's<00:03:44.269> not

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
the way around my bag so that's not

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:45.580 
the way around my bag so that's not
going<00:03:44.660> to<00:03:44.720> pose<00:03:44.870> a<00:03:44.900> problem<00:03:45.320> because<00:03:45.410> I'll

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
going to pose a problem because I'll

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.770 
going to pose a problem because I'll
just<00:03:45.799> Center<00:03:46.519> it<00:03:46.549> up<00:03:46.790> so<00:03:47.060> that<00:03:47.090> it<00:03:47.329> doesn't<00:03:47.660> hit

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
just Center it up so that it doesn't hit

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.990 
just Center it up so that it doesn't hit
that<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.739> then<00:03:48.890> that<00:03:49.160> way<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.430> tank<00:03:49.640> mounts

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
that but then that way the tank mounts

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.600 
that but then that way the tank mounts
hidden<00:03:50.269> too<00:03:50.480> and<00:03:50.840> then<00:03:51.769> the<00:03:51.920> tank<00:03:52.130> just<00:03:52.400> kind

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
hidden too and then the tank just kind

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.140 
hidden too and then the tank just kind
of<00:03:52.959> floats<00:03:53.959> there<00:03:54.430> without<00:03:55.430> any<00:03:55.850> bolts

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
of floats there without any bolts

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:58.509 
of floats there without any bolts
showing<00:03:56.480> I'll<00:03:56.989> drill<00:03:57.350> a<00:03:57.380> big<00:03:57.680> hole<00:03:57.709> on<00:03:58.280> this

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:58.519 
showing I'll drill a big hole on this

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:01.900 
showing I'll drill a big hole on this
side<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.650> then<00:04:00.650> a<00:04:00.680> smaller<00:04:01.280> hole<00:04:01.610> going

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
side and then a smaller hole going

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.789 
side and then a smaller hole going
through<00:04:02.269> so<00:04:02.480> that<00:04:02.600> I<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.810> use<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.140> same<00:04:03.380> bolt

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
through so that I can use the same bolt

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.199 
through so that I can use the same bolt
hole<00:04:04.040> that's<00:04:04.910> on<00:04:05.090> the<00:04:05.180> tank<00:04:05.420> mount<00:04:07.090> so<00:04:08.090> it

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
hole that's on the tank mount so it

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:09.699 
hole that's on the tank mount so it
comes<00:04:08.420> all<00:04:08.630> the<00:04:08.720> way<00:04:08.750> through<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.410> then<00:04:09.560> I'll

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
comes all the way through and then I'll

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:13.720 
comes all the way through and then I'll
just<00:04:10.989> cut<00:04:11.989> the<00:04:12.110> bolt<00:04:12.290> off<00:04:12.470> on<00:04:12.680> this<00:04:12.829> side<00:04:13.070> to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
just cut the bolt off on this side to

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.330 
just cut the bolt off on this side to
make<00:04:13.910> it<00:04:13.940> flush<00:04:14.530> when<00:04:15.530> I<00:04:15.590> got<00:04:15.799> it<00:04:15.920> up<00:04:16.040> in<00:04:16.130> there

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:16.340 
make it flush when I got it up in there

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:17.650 
make it flush when I got it up in there
it<00:04:16.430> wasn't<00:04:16.579> exactly<00:04:16.820> straight<00:04:17.329> so<00:04:17.450> I<00:04:17.479> went

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:17.660 
it wasn't exactly straight so I went

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.409 
it wasn't exactly straight so I went
ahead<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:17.959> beat<00:04:18.109> the<00:04:18.260> top<00:04:18.470> of<00:04:18.650> it<00:04:18.790> to<00:04:19.790> make<00:04:20.209> it

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
ahead and beat the top of it to make it

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:25.780 
ahead and beat the top of it to make it
round<00:04:20.720> around<00:04:21.200> the<00:04:22.450> the<00:04:23.560> framework<00:04:24.560> there

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:25.790 
round around the the framework there

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:29.030 
round around the the framework there
you<00:04:26.790> see<00:04:27.000> now<00:04:27.500> it's<00:04:28.500> all<00:04:28.620> starting<00:04:28.770> to<00:04:28.950> come

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
you see now it's all starting to come

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.850 
you see now it's all starting to come
together<00:04:29.960> I've<00:04:30.960> got<00:04:31.140> my<00:04:31.290> bag<00:04:31.440> mounts<00:04:31.740> in<00:04:31.830> place

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
together I've got my bag mounts in place

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.310 
together I've got my bag mounts in place
my<00:04:32.250> C<00:04:32.430> notch<00:04:32.610> is<00:04:32.760> in<00:04:32.910> place<00:04:33.120> now<00:04:33.420> I<00:04:33.450> just<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.930> got

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
my C notch is in place now I just I got

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.680 
my C notch is in place now I just I got
to<00:04:34.470> make<00:04:34.590> a<00:04:34.620> cross<00:04:34.890> remember<00:04:35.370> going<00:04:36.360> across

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
to make a cross remember going across

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.930 
to make a cross remember going across
the<00:04:37.020> top<00:04:37.230> over<00:04:37.590> there<00:04:37.680> in<00:04:37.830> the<00:04:37.920> back<00:04:38.100> that<00:04:38.820> way

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
the top over there in the back that way

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.330 
the top over there in the back that way
I<00:04:38.970> can<00:04:39.150> make<00:04:39.180> my<00:04:39.450> upper<00:04:39.750> link<00:04:39.900> bars<00:04:40.170> my<00:04:41.160> lower

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
I can make my upper link bars my lower

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.250 
I can make my upper link bars my lower
link<00:04:41.580> bars<00:04:41.820> like<00:04:42.060> I<00:04:42.240> said<00:04:42.480> I'll<00:04:42.630> go<00:04:43.020> to<00:04:43.080> those

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
link bars like I said I'll go to those

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.590 
link bars like I said I'll go to those
but<00:04:43.590> first<00:04:43.860> thing<00:04:44.010> I'm<00:04:44.130> going<00:04:44.250> to<00:04:44.310> do<00:04:44.600> before

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:45.600 
but first thing I'm going to do before

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.080 
but first thing I'm going to do before
that<00:04:45.870> is<00:04:46.290> I<00:04:47.100> haven't<00:04:47.310> flipped<00:04:47.700> my<00:04:47.910> leaf

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
that is I haven't flipped my leaf

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.610 
that is I haven't flipped my leaf
springs<00:04:48.450> now<00:04:48.660> flipping<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.110> leaf<00:04:49.260> springs

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
springs now flipping the leaf springs

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.800 
springs now flipping the leaf springs
see<00:04:50.340> how<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.580> leaf<00:04:50.820> spring<00:04:51.090> goes<00:04:51.300> around<00:04:51.630> and

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:51.810 
see how the leaf spring goes around and

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.340 
see how the leaf spring goes around and
it<00:04:51.900> calls<00:04:52.520> under<00:04:53.520> and<00:04:53.910> over<00:04:54.060> well<00:04:54.720> if<00:04:54.870> you<00:04:54.960> flip

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
it calls under and over well if you flip

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.470 
it calls under and over well if you flip
them<00:04:55.530> then<00:04:56.220> the<00:04:56.340> leaf<00:04:56.490> spring<00:04:56.790> goes<00:04:57.000> up<00:04:57.240> and

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
them then the leaf spring goes up and

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:00.950 
them then the leaf spring goes up and
around<00:04:58.040> which<00:04:59.040> allows<00:04:59.370> you<00:04:59.670> alright<00:05:00.660> I<00:05:00.690> wanted

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
around which allows you alright I wanted

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:04.900 
around which allows you alright I wanted
to<00:05:01.020> show<00:05:01.170> you<00:05:01.260> real<00:05:01.440> quick<00:05:01.680> when<00:05:02.370> you<00:05:02.490> do<00:05:02.670> this

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:04.910 
to show you real quick when you do this

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:07.760 
to show you real quick when you do this
flipping<00:05:05.910> your<00:05:06.000> leaf<00:05:06.150> spring<00:05:06.420> you<00:05:07.410> have<00:05:07.590> to

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770 
flipping your leaf spring you have to

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.480 
flipping your leaf spring you have to
put<00:05:08.220> the<00:05:09.230> overload<00:05:10.230> bar<00:05:10.470> on<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.070> other<00:05:11.190> side

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:11.490 
put the overload bar on the other side

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:13.670 
put the overload bar on the other side
well<00:05:11.700> it's<00:05:11.910> going<00:05:12.150> against<00:05:12.540> the<00:05:12.660> curve<00:05:12.900> so

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
well it's going against the curve so

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.560 
well it's going against the curve so
drop<00:05:13.920> a<00:05:13.950> bolt<00:05:14.340> down<00:05:14.550> through<00:05:14.610> for<00:05:15.090> guide<00:05:15.270> and

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
drop a bolt down through for guide and

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:18.740 
drop a bolt down through for guide and
then<00:05:16.080> use<00:05:16.290> a<00:05:16.320> c-clamp<00:05:17.070> and<00:05:17.700> clamp<00:05:18.330> it<00:05:18.450> all<00:05:18.600> the

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
then use a c-clamp and clamp it all the

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.510 
then use a c-clamp and clamp it all the
way<00:05:18.840> together<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.530> way<00:05:19.710> you<00:05:20.160> don't<00:05:20.250> have<00:05:20.340> to

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:20.520 
way together that way you don't have to

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.220 
way together that way you don't have to
keep<00:05:20.700> clamping<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:21.630> over<00:05:21.810> and<00:05:21.930> over<00:05:22.050> and<00:05:22.140> over

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
keep clamping it over and over and over

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.410 
keep clamping it over and over and over
and<00:05:22.440> over<00:05:22.470> again<00:05:22.740> and<00:05:23.400> you<00:05:24.030> get<00:05:24.180> it<00:05:24.300> straight

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:24.420 
and over again and you get it straight

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:29.000 
and over again and you get it straight
the<00:05:24.570> first<00:05:24.750> time<00:05:24.960> a<00:05:26.750> tip<00:05:27.750> of<00:05:27.870> the<00:05:27.930> day<00:05:28.080> you<00:05:28.920> ever

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
the first time a tip of the day you ever

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.190 
the first time a tip of the day you ever
had<00:05:29.220> a<00:05:29.250> problem<00:05:29.520> after<00:05:30.000> taking<00:05:30.420> your<00:05:30.600> u-bolts

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:31.200 
had a problem after taking your u-bolts

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:33.440 
had a problem after taking your u-bolts
back<00:05:31.470> off<00:05:31.770> after<00:05:32.160> you've<00:05:32.370> cut<00:05:32.700> them<00:05:32.790> and<00:05:33.360> then

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
back off after you've cut them and then

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:35.180 
back off after you've cut them and then
you<00:05:33.540> cut<00:05:33.780> them<00:05:33.900> to<00:05:34.020> make<00:05:34.590> them<00:05:34.740> so<00:05:34.920> that<00:05:35.070> they

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:35.190 
you cut them to make them so that they

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.760 
you cut them to make them so that they
don't<00:05:35.430> drag<00:05:35.730> on<00:05:35.940> anything<00:05:36.470> well<00:05:37.470> you're<00:05:37.650> you

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:37.770 
don't drag on anything well you're you

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:39.560 
don't drag on anything well you're you
both<00:05:37.980> when<00:05:38.610> you<00:05:38.640> cut<00:05:38.970> them<00:05:39.090> when<00:05:39.270> they're<00:05:39.420> on

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
both when you cut them when they're on

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.210 
both when you cut them when they're on
there<00:05:39.840> you're<00:05:40.050> cutting<00:05:40.530> them<00:05:40.620> crooked<00:05:40.920> and

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:41.220 
there you're cutting them crooked and

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.650 
there you're cutting them crooked and
cutting<00:05:41.550> them<00:05:41.640> all<00:05:41.760> messed<00:05:42.030> up<00:05:42.240> and<00:05:42.390> so<00:05:42.540> when

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:42.660 
cutting them all messed up and so when

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:43.970 
cutting them all messed up and so when
you<00:05:42.750> take<00:05:42.900> them<00:05:43.050> back<00:05:43.200> off<00:05:43.440> and<00:05:43.680> before<00:05:43.890> you

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:43.980 
you take them back off and before you

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.250 
you take them back off and before you
put<00:05:44.010> them<00:05:44.190> back<00:05:44.310> on<00:05:44.660> make<00:05:45.660> sure<00:05:45.690> you<00:05:45.900> cut<00:05:46.170> them

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:46.260 
put them back on make sure you cut them

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:49.340 
put them back on make sure you cut them
straight<00:05:46.430> again<00:05:47.600> okay<00:05:48.600> once<00:05:48.900> you<00:05:49.050> cut<00:05:49.260> them

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:49.350 
straight again okay once you cut them

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:49.730 
straight again okay once you cut them
straight

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
straight

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.360 
straight
then<00:05:50.250> take<00:05:50.610> your<00:05:51.450> angle<00:05:51.750> grinder<00:05:52.110> and<00:05:52.370> just

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.370 
then take your angle grinder and just

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:58.790 
then take your angle grinder and just
kind<00:05:53.610> of<00:05:54.500> shave<00:05:55.500> off<00:05:55.770> at<00:05:56.130> an<00:05:56.460> angle<00:05:57.500> the<00:05:58.500> tips

00:05:58.790 --> 00:05:58.800 
kind of shave off at an angle the tips

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.430 
kind of shave off at an angle the tips
all<00:05:59.460> the<00:05:59.520> tips<00:06:00.000> and<00:06:00.240> what<00:06:00.840> that'll<00:06:01.140> do<00:06:01.290> is

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
all the tips and what that'll do is

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.200 
all the tips and what that'll do is
that'll<00:06:01.680> set<00:06:02.010> it<00:06:02.130> back<00:06:02.250> up<00:06:02.520> so<00:06:02.550> that<00:06:02.850> it's<00:06:02.970> easy

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
that'll set it back up so that it's easy

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.980 
that'll set it back up so that it's easy
to<00:06:03.390> put<00:06:03.570> your<00:06:03.720> bolts<00:06:03.930> back<00:06:04.080> on<00:06:05.600> okay<00:06:06.600> and<00:06:06.930> I

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
to put your bolts back on okay and I

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.720 
to put your bolts back on okay and I
still<00:06:07.170> got<00:06:07.320> the<00:06:07.350> front<00:06:07.590> end<00:06:07.770> up<00:06:08.010> where<00:06:08.310> that<00:06:08.550> I

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:08.730 
still got the front end up where that I
