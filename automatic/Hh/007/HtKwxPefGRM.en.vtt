 explained 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.530
 on one of the sides I came to live 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.190
 this fear we will not work became unconscious and the arrival only 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.440
 everyone who arrived 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.340

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.340
 I kissed 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.770
 in the corner the two health centers in Cape Town 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.680
 Then you start working on the play. 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.400
 the wallet 

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.960
 solve 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.830
 them 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:02.830
 in the little staircase 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.420
 You'll do this until you get around every day. 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.489
 at work 

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:17.879
 university 

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:22.060
 here abbot of our father took and the evidence 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.519
 base that you charge 

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.249
 three sides 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:27.989
 on one end 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:31.629
 that this I saw what is known only that someone with an extra point 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:35.659
 this is the bag part of 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.369
 I also passed the peak around 

00:02:38.369 --> 00:02:40.249
 branding finishing 

00:02:40.249 --> 00:02:43.249
 and we are going to sew 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:45.849
 two sides 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:48.849
 from nasa 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.549
 is with astorga tipped to use nylon line 

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.899
 that line psdb zin at last 

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.260
 she looks like the most famous 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.579
 strong and accurate colors strong 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.509
 but more that your focus will be the glued paste will appear in the other this and this 

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:08.009
 it's not the idea 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.179
 each side of nylon line 

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:16.119
 I attached my line to one of the fields, the top of the rest of the piece goes 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.090
 be seamless because 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.090
 I think we want to work on layoffs 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:24.739
 We're going to sew until we get caught. 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.479
 point to point 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.630
 as if they were 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.630
 a padlock 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.819
 with the bubble in the closet 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.579
 she will get stuck after firing and killing those tips 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.429
 and it will not appear 

00:03:44.429 --> 00:03:47.899
 posture 

00:03:47.899 --> 00:03:51.339
 now we are going to work the stance has to be a legal framework 

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:55.969
 I mean we sew all the way around 

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:58.419
 on the turn 

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.439
 and now let's work the seams between a woman 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.480
 you may be putting the needles to aid in the construction 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:09.519
 And you'll be working holding on. 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.519
 the space 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:16.729
 and whether that period can be 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.999
 since the needles do not fall 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:24.349
 there is no need to do something too tight because you can stay 

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:25.779
 without scoring 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:27.990
 but can be sold without 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.870
 but you can see all the needles 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.870
 in a small space 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:38.870
 try to leave a part that will stay out of the fold 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.189
 in a small space 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.189
 so that you are especially dreamy too 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:48.279
 can be a country pass what each piece account of the decision 

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:53.800
 finished his work he should stay like this 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.559
 I did a little to and I had to 

00:04:56.559 --> 00:04:59.069
 pc rebound 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:01.770
 I put it until the end of the month 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.120
 teenager 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:04.139
 on Tuesday 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.139
 I did not get that point because when you go back to operating 

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.580
 It can last for years. 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.710
 the category is hospitalized released the day treasurer 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.110
 aluminum 

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:19.729
 here is the folded piece 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.270

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.499
