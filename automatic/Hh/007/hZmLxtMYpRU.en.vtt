this IRS but they're all IRS swing axles
IRS<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:07.680> reluctant<00:02:07.920> to<00:02:08.160> call<00:02:08.369> it<00:02:08.520> an<00:02:08.610> IRS

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.420 
think
swing<00:02:13.740> axle<00:02:14.220> looks<00:02:14.850> better<00:02:15.090> on<00:02:15.870> a<00:02:15.900> dune<00:02:16.140> buggy

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
exposed but everybody says that this

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.450

rear<00:02:20.460> setup<00:02:21.420> is<00:02:21.600> superior<00:02:22.440> to<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.800> swing<00:02:23.100> axle

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
rear setup is superior to the swing axle
