when<00:00:05.630> a<00:00:05.660> target<00:00:05.930> is<00:00:06.200> detected<00:00:08.920> the<00:00:09.920> vision

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:10.250 
when a target is detected the vision

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:12.129 
when a target is detected the vision
displays<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:10.970> information<00:00:11.090> at<00:00:11.780> three

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:12.139 
displays the information at three

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.380 
displays the information at three
different<00:00:12.320> frequencies<00:00:13.130> the<00:00:13.700> top<00:00:13.970> one<00:00:14.240> is

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:14.390 
different frequencies the top one is

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.780 
different frequencies the top one is
always<00:00:14.600> your<00:00:14.870> high<00:00:15.050> frequency<00:00:15.769> the<00:00:16.400> center

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:16.790 
always your high frequency the center

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.670 
always your high frequency the center
one<00:00:17.050> is<00:00:18.430> your<00:00:19.430> 7.5<00:00:20.300> and<00:00:20.779> the<00:00:21.110> bottom<00:00:21.500> one<00:00:21.650> is

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
one is your 7.5 and the bottom one is

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.600 
one is your 7.5 and the bottom one is
your<00:00:22.040> lower<00:00:22.250> frequency<00:00:23.950> the<00:00:24.950> information

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:25.610 
your lower frequency the information

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.580 
your lower frequency the information
will<00:00:25.790> vary<00:00:26.119> somewhat<00:00:26.630> from<00:00:26.689> frequency<00:00:27.470> to

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:27.590 
will vary somewhat from frequency to

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.450 
will vary somewhat from frequency to
frequency<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:29.660> a<00:00:30.500> lot<00:00:30.680> of<00:00:30.710> that<00:00:30.919> depends<00:00:31.310> on

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:31.460 
frequency and a lot of that depends on

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.810 
frequency and a lot of that depends on
the<00:00:31.550> alloy<00:00:31.939> of<00:00:32.119> the<00:00:32.270> target<00:00:35.890> when<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.039> squeeze

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
the alloy of the target when you squeeze

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.360 
the alloy of the target when you squeeze
the<00:00:38.090> trigger<00:00:38.120> for<00:00:38.600> pinpointing<00:00:39.289> you<00:00:39.800> also<00:00:40.010> get

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
the trigger for pinpointing you also get

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.680 
the trigger for pinpointing you also get
three<00:00:40.670> frequencies

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.290 

the<00:00:45.200> strongest<00:00:45.770> frequency<00:00:46.460> is<00:00:46.970> a<00:00:47.000> good

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
the strongest frequency is a good

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.510 
the strongest frequency is a good
indicator<00:00:47.720> of<00:00:47.870> what<00:00:48.079> type<00:00:48.320> of<00:00:48.350> alloy<00:00:48.890> you're

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:49.520 
indicator of what type of alloy you're

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.540 
indicator of what type of alloy you're
detecting<00:00:50.180> again<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.530> high<00:00:51.739> frequency<00:00:52.430> is

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
detecting again the high frequency is

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.180 
detecting again the high frequency is
your<00:00:52.760> top<00:00:53.000> number<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.660> that<00:00:54.559> is<00:00:54.770> going<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.070> be

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:55.190 
your top number and that is going to be

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.240 
your top number and that is going to be
stronger<00:00:55.640> on<00:00:56.030> nickel<00:00:56.420> and<00:00:56.600> gold<00:00:56.840> the<00:00:57.770> bottom

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
stronger on nickel and gold the bottom

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.509 
stronger on nickel and gold the bottom
bar<00:00:58.879> is<00:00:59.210> your<00:00:59.629> lowest<00:01:00.140> frequency<00:01:00.769> and<00:01:01.100> it<00:01:01.400> is

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
bar is your lowest frequency and it is

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.250 
bar is your lowest frequency and it is
going<00:01:01.670> to<00:01:01.730> be<00:01:01.879> stronger<00:01:02.300> on<00:01:02.570> your<00:01:02.750> silver<00:01:03.080> and

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
going to be stronger on your silver and

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.180

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
the bar that is the strongest reading is

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.370 
the bar that is the strongest reading is
a<00:01:10.010> good<00:01:10.520> indicator<00:01:11.030> of<00:01:11.330> what<00:01:11.660> type<00:01:11.900> of<00:01:12.080> alloy

point five which is your high frequency

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:52.120 
point five which is your high frequency
nickel<00:01:50.229> so<00:01:51.229> that's<00:01:51.380> going<00:01:51.560> to<00:01:51.619> be<00:01:51.709> much<00:01:51.890> more

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
nickel so that's going to be much more

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.160 
nickel so that's going to be much more
